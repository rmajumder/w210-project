  "<p>In late July, when Barack Obama toured the Middle East, he met the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, for a private briefing on the state of the world's most intractable conflict - a major priority for the next occupant of the Oval Office.</p> <p>Abbas revealed later that when he told the Democratic candidate about the Arab peace initiative - offering Israel normal relations with all 22 Arab countries in exchange for a Palestinian state - Obama's (clearly private) response was unambiguous: \"The Israelis must be crazy not to accept that.\"</p> <p>It's a telling anecdote that is highly relevant as Arabs and Israelis await the outcome of the US election and ponder how - or whether - their faltering peace process can be sustained or revived once a new administration is in place. After eight disastrous years of George Bush, and zero hopes for an 11th-hour negotiating breakthrough between Palestinians and Israelis, there is a real thirst for change in Washington.</p> <p>And it is also high time, some argue, to revisit that Arab initiative not because it can by itself resolve those knotty bilateral issues of borders, settlements, Jerusalem and refugees - but because it could help persuade sceptical Israelis that there are benefits and a place for them in the wider Middle East.</p> <p>The plan Abbas described to Obama was launched by the Saudi Crown Prince (now King) Abdullah at the 2002 Beirut Arab summit, and it is another leading Saudi royal who is promoting it again now: Prince Turki al-Faisal, the king's nephew, is the ex-head of Saudi intelligence as well as former ambassador to London and Washington. Not much has happened in the Middle East in the last 30 years that he wasn't involved in or doesn't have intimate knowledge of.</p> <p>So despite insisting that he was speaking as a private individual, there was rapt attention this week when he appealed to Israelis to listen carefully to what the initiative actually says - and to respond positively to it. </p> <p>Every Arab state, as Turki put it, \"made clear that they will pay the price for peace, not only by recognising Israel as a legitimate state in the area, but also to normalise relations with it and end the state of hostilities that had existed since 1948.\"</p> <p>The quid pro quo was that Israel too must \"accept peace as a strategic choice ... withdraw completely from all the lands they occupied in 1967, including Jerusalem ... accept a just solution for the refugee problem ... and recognise the independent state of Palestine.\"</p> <p>No serving Israeli officials were present at the \"track-two\" dialogue organised by the Oxford Research Group. But former (and still influential) denizens of the worlds of diplomacy, the military and intelligence were there along with a leading pro-Abbas Palestinian, senior Egyptians, Americans and Britons. Representatives of Hamas, Syria and Iran, either official or unofficial, were conspicuously absent.</p> <p>It was common ground that part of the problem is that the Arab initiative was overshadowed by the worst incident of the second intifada - when a Palestinian suicide bomber killed 30 Israelis at their Passover meal on the eve of the Beirut summit - and Israel reoccupied most of the West Bank.</p> <p>The plan generated headlines when it was re-endorsed, again under Saudi auspices, at the Riyadh Arab summit last year. But thanks to Israeli objections it did not get a mention when Bush convened the Annapolis conference a few months later. The Annapolis goal of Israeli-Palestinian agreement by the end of his presidency looks like a bad joke.</p> <p>Ignorance is part of the problem. As someone quipped: you can wake an Israeli of a certain age at 3am, say the word \"Khartoum\" and he will immediately identify the post-1967 war Arab summit in the Sudanese capital that produced three notorious \"noes\" - no peace, no recognition, no negotiations with Israel (which set the Arab consensus, broken only by Egypt, for the next 20 years). But the Saudi plan, which says exactly the opposite, is still likely to produce blank stares at any time.</p> <p>Ehud Olmert, Israel's outgoing prime minister, misrepresented the Arab initiative as a take-it-or-leave-it diktat, claiming it required the return of millions of Palestinian refugees - a red line for the any Israeli government - when it in fact talks sensibly of reaching \"a just solution\". Nor does it preclude negotiating land swaps, for example, so that Palestinians would get territory to compensate them for areas where post-1967 Israeli settlements cannot be moved.</p> <p>Israelis who are familiar with the plan often say they still crave some grand gesture as evidence of Arab goodwill - citing Anwar Sadat's dramatic, taboo-breaking journey to Jerusalem in 1977 (though in fact Sadat had been promised the return of the Sinai peninsula before he got on the plane).</p> <p>The response, from Prince Turki and others, is that Arab relations with Israel cannot undergo wholesale \"normalisation\" - a highly sensitive word in the political lexicon of the Middle East - until Israel shows it is prepared to resolve the Palestinian issue. Settlement activity in the West Bank - doubled since Oslo in 1993 and continuing since Annapolis - is hardly a signal of that.</p> <p>\"Instead of talking about whether the glass is half full or half empty,\" said one participant, \"I prefer to say there is bucket with some water in it but holes about one third of the way up: the holes are the settlements and whatever progress has been made we can't make any more until those holes are plugged.\"</p> <p>So it is good news that leading Israelis are planning a campaign to breathe new life into the Arab peace initiative, advertising the benefits of a comprehensive settlement which consigns the entire conflict to history. Polling shows Israelis no longer believe in Oslo-like incrementalism with a distant goal held hostage to endless process. Improved salesmanship can certainly popularise a good but neglected product.</p> <p>But there will have to be substantial change if there is to be anything for the next US president to work with. \"The Israelis need to show the Arabs that they are prepared to pay a political price to move forward - and that it's not all about tactics,\" warned a senior Arab diplomat. \"No amount of PR will work until there is a meaningful peace process that has some chance of going somewhere.\"</p>",

  "<p>Sad to say, this is my last column for Weekend. Like John McCain and Barack Obama, I have to focus all my attention on the financial crisis. In my case, this involves filling my basement with apples that I'll soon be selling on the street. I also have to find one of those pairs of shoes where your toes stick out, and a hobo knapsack, and learn all the words to Brother, Can You Spare A Dime? and grow my beard into a kind of rugged stubble and practise hobbling around with my sign that says, \"Will write for food\".</p> <p>Now is a kind of calm-before-the-storm moment here in America. We have the aforementioned financial crisis, we have two wars going on, we have a vice-presidential candidate who, in terms of how she talks, she just, what she does is, phrases are added, which what that means, in terms of her meaning? Is, what she does is, puts new ones on, or conjoining, in order so that she, when speaking, can glean closer into that thing, which, hopefully, she has been meaning? </p> <p>So that's reassuring. It's been a long time since we were led by someone whose command of the language was, in terms of how good he is, or were, no, not so hot, basically ungood, when looking upon it. </p> <p>But not to worry. America's fine. Although I have, these past two years, made a lot of fun of America, like the smart-mouthed kid in the back seat of the car making fun of his family. Of course he loves his family, of course he believes in his family: he is the product of that family; that family is all he knows. His criticism can be seen as a form of engagement, of intimacy, of love, even.</p> <p>America is having an identity crisis. On one side: fear, aggression, banality, xenophobia. On the other: hopefulness, humour, confidence in human nature, critical thought. This battle is not being fought along party lines; it is not the case that one party or candidate holds a monopoly on these positive virtues. No: it is more existential and every one of us is fighting it internally. Which country are we to be? The terrified, torturing, isolated bully; or the tolerant, slow-to-anger, naive-but-bright protector-of-the-poor? It's not altogether a new battle: the American heart - hell, maybe the human heart - has been divided along these lines for a long time. But here, in our time, it feels like the battle is heating up. So, as they used to say on TV: stay tuned.</p> <p>Finally, I want to say how much I've enjoyed writing this column these past two years, and how much I've appreciated your interest and support. It has been a great honour, and I'll never forget your collective national kindness. Thank you, England, and goodbye for now.</p>",
  "<p>I wonder if, when the first signs of recovery arrive - which, since Gordon Brown never did abolish boom and bust, is bound to happen one day - the prime minister will make a speech in which he says, \"ladies and gentlemen, I have done my part. Now is the time for a novice!\"</p> <p>\u2022 As I said last week, it's hard to detect the signs that we are hurtling towards a terrible slump. Our overpriced trains, for example, are more crowded than ever. Last weekend I had to travel on Virgin. Having arrived early I gave up my seat so a group could sit together, then realised too late that there were no other seats to be had, anywhere. By the time we left Watford not only were the \"vestibules\" - the quaint term they use for the gaps between carriages - full of people sitting down, but all the aisles were packed with people standing. There was literally nowhere to go. So an elderly couple and I pushed our way through to first class where we plonked ourselves down.</p> <p>The train manager came up and clucked and tutted and warned us we were liable for a large extra fare, but in view of the circumstances ... one pleasant thing was that weekdays on Virgin they dish out rather nice food and limitless drinks, including booze. The amiable guy in charge of the trolley insisted on serving me even though I was on a cheap ticket. </p> <p>Then the train manager started escorting people in ones and twos from standard to get seats in first. But he only chose very respectable looking folk - men in suits and ties, for example, so the more sensitive first class passengers wouldn't feel swamped by riff-raff. It was a very British touch.</p> <p>Later in the week I was chatting to Christian Wolmar, the greatest expert on British trains. He said that it had been Richard Branson's personal decision to put four first-class carriages on the new Pendolino trains, with only four and a half (one has the \"shop\" in it) standard class. This was to maximise revenue. It certainly maximises passengers' discomfort, but who cares about them? They'll travel anyway.</p> <p>\u2022 Wind turbines - the menace grows. John Nott, who was defence minister at the time of the Falklands, wants to build two of the things, each 82 feet (25 metres) tall, on his estate at St Erth in Cornwall. They will be 30 feet higher than the local church. Not surprisingly, his neighbours are furious and are doing all they can to stop him. But the incredible thing about these monstrosities is that they will generate only 25 kilowatts, enough to meet just half the needs of his home, his farm and five holiday cottages. But what crazed person would want to holiday near these things?</p> <p>\u2022 I went to the party to launch Alan Coren's posthumous collection Chocolate and Cuckoo Clocks (his line was that Switzerland was famous mostly for chocolate and snow, both of which melt, so they had to invent the cuckoo clock to allow people to buy souvenirs). There I ran into Andy Hamilton, who is touring the country with his Hat Of Doom show. He told me a true story which he's incorporated into the act. He was on a crowded and sweaty tube train, when a truly ugly customer got on. Shaven head, aggressive expression, tattoo round his neck - the lot. He squeezed next to Andy, who is very short, and began bellowing down his mobile phone: \"Gary, I'm going to kill you, you fucking [very bad word indeed]!\"</p> <p>Andy felt this was pretty intolerable, \"so I decided to see if humour would work. I said, 'excuse me, but this is a very crowded train. Would you mind threatening your friend in a slightly lower tone of voice?' He gave me a look, and I thought I'd really let myself in for it. But instead he picked up the phone again and whispered into it 'Gary, I'm going to kill you, you fucking [same very bad word indeed]!'\"</p> <p>\u2022 Other people I've run into this week include an American chap who has lived in Britain for some time, but is still on the voting register back home. \"People keep telling me that John McCain spent five years in a Vietnamese prison,\" he said. \"Well, so did Gary Glitter, and I'm not voting for him either.\"</p> <p>Then there was Norman Tebbit, who I interviewed for a radio programme. He astonished me by saying that he had just had his first cookbook accepted by a publisher. It's a book of recipes for game - pheasant, venison and so forth. I suppose there could even be a TV series to go with it, though I hope it would have some un-Jamie type title, such as The Fully-Clothed Chef. And it seems highly unlikely that the camera will linger lovingly on Norman licking his fingers or gazing kittenishly into the lens.</p> <p>\u2022 I spent last Saturday night in Frinton-on-Sea, Essex, where I was giving a talk. Frinton is famously the most genteel town in Britain. It has only one pub (\"but you can always get a drink in the tennis club or the golf club,\" a resident told me) and only recently allowed a fish and chip shop. The beach is very fine and there is nothing along it - no amusements, snack bars, ponies, or anything at all except sand. Saturday night was eerie. You could walk the streets and there was absolutely nobody about. It was as quiet as if a neutron bomb had wiped out the population.</p> <p>But the audience was lively and fun, and the organisers invited me back to a very jolly party, where someone said, \"most of the nightlife here is in people's houses, and we like it that way\". The big row is over The Gates, which I assumed was a triumphal arch of some kind, but which turned out to mean an old-fashioned, manually operated level-crossing. These are a vital social indicator in Frinton - estate agents advertise properties as \"inside the Gates\" - and so the inhabitants are appalled at the plan to replace them with automatic barriers.</p>",
  "<p>As the US presidential election reaches a climax against the background of the financial crisis, another silent, dark, time bomb of an issue hangs over the two candidates: torture. For now, there seems to be a shared desire not to delve too deeply into the circumstances in which the Bush administration allowed the US military and the CIA to embrace abusive techniques of interrogation - including waterboarding, in the case of the CIA - which violate the Geneva conventions and the 1984 UN torture convention. </p> <p>The torture issue's cancerous consequences go deep, and will cause headaches for the next president. New evidence has emerged in Congressional inquiries that throw more light on the extent to which early knowledge and approval of the abuse went to the highest levels. What does a country do when compelling evidence shows its leaders have authorised international crimes?</p> <p>For three years I have followed a trail which leads unambiguously to the conclusion that the real bad eggs were not Lyndie England or others on the ground in Abu Ghraib, but the most senior officials in the White House, the Pentagon and the department of justice. Over recent months, Congress has been looking into the role of senior officials involved in the development of interrogation rules. These have attracted relatively scant attention; little by little, however, senators and congressmen have uncovered the outlines of a potentially far-reaching criminal conspiracy. </p> <p>The first hearings were convened before the judiciary committee of the House of Representatives, at the instance of its chairman, Congressman John Conyers, apparently off the back of my book Torture Team. Parallel hearings have been held before the Senate armed services committee. </p> <p>The evidence that has emerged is potentially devastating. It confirms, for instance, that the search for new interrogation techniques for use at Guant\u00e1namo began not with the local military but in the offices of Donald Rumsfeld and his chief lawyer, Jim Haynes. It shows that when the career military expressed objections on legal grounds, Haynes intervened to stop the normal process of review. And it shows a previously unknown interplay between the department of defence and the CIA: a visit to Guant\u00e1namo in September 2002 by the administration's most senior lawyers was followed days later by a senior CIA lawyer, to brief on the new techniques. \"If someone dies while aggressive techniques are being used,\" he explained, \"the backlash of attention would be severely detrimental.\" </p> <p>Last month the Senate armed services committee received new material from Condoleezza Rice, the first cabinet-level official to confirm high-level involvement in discussions on interrogation techniques. \"I participated in a number of meetings in 2002 and 2003 ... at which issues relating to detainees in US custody, including interrogation issues, were discussed,\" she said. Those present at such meetings included Rumsfeld, attorney general John Ashcroft, Colin Powell, Paul Wolfowitz and CIA director George Tenet. The meetings, which concerned the CIA programme, \"occurred inside the White House\". Rice confirmed she was aware of the existence of, but did not read, the justice department legal advice of August 1 2002 that abandoned the international definition of torture and replaced it with a definition drawn from a US Medicare statute. </p> <p>Buried away in this testimony lies the most dangerous material of all: evidence which may establish that abuses on detainees in Iraq in September 2003, in the period perhaps including the events at Abu Ghraib, were the result of decisions taken at the highest levels of the administration. The administration has long proclaimed it did not allow aggressive interrogations in Iraq, since the Geneva conventions applied. Last month we learned this was false: not everyone had protection under Geneva. If you were considered to be a terrorist, you had no protection at all. A senior US intelligence officer visited Iraq in September 2003. He witnessed abusive interrogation techniques that violated Geneva and complained. The response? He was told the techniques \"were pre-approved by DoD GC or higher\". DoD GC is the general counsel at the department of defence, Jim Haynes. Who could be higher? His boss: Rumsfeld.</p> <p>I have testified before Congress on these issues, and have been asked if there should be criminal investigations and prosecutions. At the very least, the next US president must ensure the full facts are established. It will then be for others to decide what follows. But if the US doesn't get its own house in order and restore its reputation for the rule of law, others will surely step in. </p> <p>\u2022 Philippe Sands QC is professor of law at UCL, a barrister at Matrix Chambers and author of Torture Team <a href=\"http://mailto:p.sands@ucl.ac.uk\">p.sands@ucl.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>With avenues to victory in the presidential race closing fast, Republicans are now laying the groundwork for casting doubt on the results. Prepare yourself for lurid tales, these next two-and-a-half weeks, of \"voter fraud\".</p> <p>Here's the situation. Turnout in America is lower than in other countries - we consider 55%-60% to be an achievement. The 40%-45% of Americans who do not vote, studies show, tend to be from lower-income and more African-American and Latino households than the general population. In other words, more Democratic.</p> <p>Hence, Democrats are forever trying to expand the electorate. In the past two years, they have registered huge numbers of voters in some important states. In Florida this year for example, Democrats have added about 450,000 voters, Republicans just 170,000.</p> <p>Republicans have always tried to suppress turnout, sometimes by fair means but often by foul. Every election season in black communities across the US, mysterious handbills appear warning citizens - untruthfully - that if they owe back taxes or even parking tickets, they can't vote. Voting machines have tended to \"malfunction\" on election day at a higher rate in black areas than in white. None of this, of course, is ever traceable.</p> <p>This is what we historically call voter suppression. Republicans, ever alert to opportunities to spoon-feed the media storylines proving that \"both sides\" are guilty of excess, have countered with narratives about voter fraud. But how real is voter fraud? It exists here and there, no doubt. But a study by a Columbia University found that between 2002 and 2005, the US justice department won just 24 successful voter-fraud convictions - in the entire country - during the same period that the department made such prosecutions a high priority. </p> <p>If this is a crime wave, we could do with many more like it.</p> <p>This year, with an African-American Democratic nominee and black turnout expected to hit record levels, the effort has gone into overdrive. One nationwide community organising group, Acorn, stands accused of all manner of fraudulent voter registration. The group acknowledges that some of its organisers did pad out their numbers. But it says it fired them. </p> <p>A few days ago the FBI leaked that it was investigating Acorn - interesting timing, no? A former federal prosecutor in New Mexico, a conservative Republican who was controversially fired by the Bush administration in large part because he did not see voter fraud as a major criminal enterprise, says the investigation smells to high heaven. \"I'm astounded that this issue is being trotted out again,\" he told the website Talking Points Memo on Thursday. \"Based on what I saw in 2004 and 2006, it's a scare tactic.\"</p> <p>It's that, all right, but it's more. Republicans are bracing themselves for a John McCain loss. They probably don't believe that \"exposing\" large-scale fraud can salvage the election for them. But they may well be thinking along other lines.</p> <p>Suppose Barack Obama wins, but a narrower victory than expected. Say he gets 284 electoral votes, and that 20 of those 284 come from Ohio. Since 270 are needed to win, Ohio will be the difference between victory and defeat. And suppose the Ohio vote is outside the margin that automatically triggers a recount, as was the case in Florida in 2000, but is still moderately close - 3% or so.</p> <p>You can bet in such a case that the Republicans will challenge the result. They will find a few cases of people voting from the wrong address. Their propagandists on the Fox News channel will follow. They likely won't prevail, but the effort will have the crucial effect of casting doubt on Obama's legitimacy and impinging on his mandate.</p> <p>The Obama people know all this, which is why they're working for a margin that would make such challenges moot. In the meantime, as you hear and read the sensational stories, remember the 24-person crime wave.</p>",
  "<p>Former secretary of state <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/colin-powell\">Colin Powell</a> is expected to use a high-profile television appearance tomorrow to end months of speculation by throwing his support behind <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>.</p> <p>His decision to go on television just two weeks before the election suggests he has finally made up his mind.</p> <p>Powell, a four-star general who worked closely with three Republican presidents, said he would decide between Obama and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>, a long-time friend, after watching the presidential debates, the last of which was held on Wednesday.</p> <p>His endorsement would be the biggest Obama has secured so far. As a prominent member of President George Bush's administration, he may shift some Republican-leaning voters into Obama's camp.</p> <p>McCain's campaign team admitted privately it would be a blow, not least because it would be another day in which Obama dominated the news. But Democratic strategists are divide about the benefits. One said yesterday he was concerned it could backfire. He suggested that Powell's decision might be seen as being based on racial solidarity and that could alienate some white voters already reluctant to back Obama on grounds of race.</p> <p>The sceptical strategist added that Powell, though once so popular he was considered as a potential candidate for the White House, was badly tarnished by his involvement, as secretary of state, in making the case for Saddam Hussein having weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>Powell, 71, who is to appear on NBC's Meet the Press, told a conference in Washington last month that he was undecided. \"I've said to my beloved friend and colleague, John McCain, a friend of 25 years - John, I love you - but I'm not just going to vote for you on the basis of our affection and friendship,\" Powell said.</p> <p>\"I've said to Barack Obama, I admire you, I'll give you all the advice I can, but I won't vote for you just because you're black. We have to move beyond this.\"</p> <p>Obama won the endorsement yesterday of the Washington Post. \"There are few public figures we have respected more over the years than Senator John McCain. Yet it is without ambivalence that we endorse Senator Barack Obama for president,\" the Post said.</p> <p>The newspaper said McCain had lost its support because of the way he conducted his campaign - singling out his choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate. The Post was the 40th newspaper to endorse Obama for president. So far McCain has the support of 15 newspapers.</p> <p>The presidential race continued to be transfixed by Joe the Plumber, the Ohio man invoked by McCain in this week's final debate as the symbol of what he claimed was Obama's \"class warfare\" against ordinary working people. Joe Wurzelbacher's 15 minutes of fame is now stretching into its third full day and shows no sign of abating.</p> <p>McCain organisers have been trying to get Wurzelbacher to appear alongside McCain at a campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio, tomorrow. But invitations to appear on the weekend's TV talkshows may prove more alluring. Though he has refused to say who will get his vote, Wurzelbacher's story has prompted a fiercely partisan reaction from the US media. </p> <p>Liberal bloggers focused on idiosyncracies in his personal details - the fact that he owes almost $1,200 in back taxes, that he has had no formal plumbing training and holds no licence, and that his full name is not Joe at all but Samuel J Wurzelbacher.</p> <p>Rightwing bloggers retaliated against what they called such smear-mongering. \"The left's political plumbers are attacking the messenger ... It's standard operating procedure for the Obama thug machine,\" wrote Michelle Malkin.</p> <p>In Pennsylvania on Thursday McCain told a rally that Wurzelbacher had been the real winner of the debate \"because people are not going to let Senator Obama raise taxes in a tough economy\", prompting chants of \"Joe! Joe! Joe!\" from the crowd.</p> <p>In New Hampshire, Obama asked supporters: \"How many plumbers do you know making a quarter of a million dollars a year?\"</p> <p>Meanwhile McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, is taking her critics at first hand by appearing in Saturday Night Live. The entertainment show has been running a popularly parody of the Alaska governor by comedian Tina Fey.</p> <h2>The week</h2> <p><strong>Confession of the week</strong></p> <p>\"If I were watching Fox News, I wouldn't vote for me, right?

  "<p>High in the French Alps, above Nice and the southern ski resorts, an elderly shepherd is allowed to stay in the rubble ruins of an old army barracks while his sheep graze on the mountainside in the warmer months. An eagle floats regally above a nearby peak. This is the top of the Mercantour national park, a deserted mountainous area that is one of France's last patches of near wilderness - and so well kept a secre, that wolves have crossed over the nearby Italian border and started to breed again. </p> <p>But its serene mix of peaks and lakes has now become the backdrop for a bitter row over rambling. Plans for a \u20ac20m (\u00a316m) footpath and plush lodges, which would catapult the Mercantour from a little-known corner of the Alps to a beacon of international rambling \"prestige\", has sparked controversy. Local politicians and park leaders are scrambling to contain the trekking wars. </p> <p>On one side is one of France's most debonair political figures, Christian Estrosi, a former motorbike champion. As well as being mayor of Nice, he is an MP and the head of the Alpes Martimes region. Dubbed \"Sarko boy\", Estrosi is a friend and political lieutenant of the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and shares his belief that trendy policies and showbiz glitz are crucial. He swiftly appeared at Nice's main hospital to congratulate the actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie on the birth of their twins. </p> <p>Having served twice as a minister alongside Sarkozy, Estrosi is determined to use his recent election in Nice to boost France's fifth biggest city. He knows that a city with one of the biggest urban votes for Sarkozy has sway among the national centre-right ruling party. </p> <p>So while his president is pushing a new green agenda, Estrosi has decided to not only plot Nice's battle to become France's greenest city, but to include the nearby mountains in his plans. </p> <p>The Mercantour, which straddles the Italian border and is barely an hour and a half's drive from Nice, has the richest diversity of flora and fauna in France. His dream is to turn the French side of the park into a centre of \"international prestige trekking\" that would rival the Mont Blanc circuit. But he did not count on the outrage that the plans to renovate paths and build state-of-the-art accommodation for the 87-mile (140km) route would produce. An assorted group of walkers, mountain climbers, forest workers and Alpine bloggers have declared war, opening a debate on ramblers' obligations to the environment. </p> <p>When work started in late summer on a new five-mile stretch of the path between two isolated lakes, local mountain lovers mobilised. Some trekked four hours into the mountains to protest, laying out their rucksacks to read \"non\". Then a group descended on Nice with banners, calling it a battle for the soul of the Alps. Now two local park workers have launched court proceedings over the destruction of examples of rare species of old maritime Alpine plants during what they called the brutality of building work using dynamite and diggers hauled in by helicopter. </p> <p>\"It's James Bond,\" said Vincent Kulesza, the forest ranger, as he stood at 2,000 metres surveying the landscape. \"Politicians don't know what real nature is, they do everything too quickly, submitting the landscape to their caprice.\" </p> <p>The regional government, keen to limit this image of ploughing through land, said the path will shrink back to 60cm to 80cm wide in a couple of years, and promised more consultation.</p> <p>But with summer tourism in the mountains in decline, others wonder who will use the new route. </p> <p>Laurence Roussol, of the non-profit group Mountain Wilderness, said it was vital the path did not just skim the top of the mountain as a high-altitude ramble, but dip into the valley villages to keep life going there. It shouldn't just be a \"jewel for city people at the weekend\". </p> <p>The group is now in consultation on the plans but could get \"radical\" if they feel the environment is at risk, he said. </p> <p>Eric Teisseire, an architect and regular mountain climber, said he feared \"political ambition\" had been \"dumped on the back of the national park\". He remembered the creation of the park in 1979, specifically to protect a slim strip of mountains from the concrete onslaught of ski-resort building. To go back on that and start putting economics before environment by commercialising the park would be \"abhorrent\", he said. </p> <p>Pierre Commenville, a deputy director of the Mercantour national park, said the strength of opposition to the plans \"shows how attached the people are to an area like this, how conscious people are of the mountains\". He admitted that some plants from rare, protected species had been destroyed in the work this summer but said the environmental impact would be strictly monitored. </p> <p>Others are hoping that if the plans follow proper environmental rules, there could be a rambling transformation. Pierre Schropff, an alpine guide, said: \"It's an extraordinary idea that will make the mountain accessible not just to an elite of mountain climbers but to motivated ordinary tourists as well.\"</p>",

For the three weeks I have been in Roanoke we have talked politics together over the buffet most days.</p> <p>But yesterday was different. Barack Obama was coming to town, and Sam was going to be there. \"I've got to go,\" he said. \"That's going to be our next president.\"</p> <p>All over Roanoke people were making preparations. Meghan, an Obama volunteer, asked me what I thought she should wear. Students at Patrick Henry high school were discussing taking the day off. Three hours before Obama's scheduled appearance, hundreds of people were queuing in the rain. It seemed like almost everybody in town wanted to be there.</p> <p>It is a stark change from the day I arrived at the end of last month. Back then, the Dow index opened at 11,139, Obama and John McCain were tied in the polls in the state, and most local Democrats were still in the closet.</p> <p>Roanoke sits like a tiny Democratic island in a sea of staunch Republican waters. Culturally and economically the city dominates the region; but politically it is completely surrounded. Just three weeks ago, Obama supporters in a nearby town were asking the local Democratic campaign organiser not to reveal their affiliations publicly for fear of being ostracised.</p> <p>At Pop's Ice-cream and Soda Bar, patrons discussed their support for Obama in hushed tones until they spotted an Obama sign on the popcorn machine. \"Oh, it's OK,\" one said out loud. \"They have an Obama poster.\"</p> <p>When you asked black people if they thought whites in the state would support a black candidate they responded with a lengthy pause, and then equivocation. </p> <p>\"They should,\" said one woman after what seemed like an age. \"If they're paying attention.\"</p> <p>\"But do you think they actually will?\" I asked. Pause. \"I don't know,\" she said.</p> <p>As I prepared to leave the town yesterday, the Dow was down 25%, Obama was up in Virginia by 5% and Democrats were out and proud as Obama addressed a capacity crowd at the local civic centre.</p> <p>This gathering in confidence has been slow but definite. There was an art auction, Fine Art to Elect a Fine Man, which raised $4,100. Last weekend Bill Clinton visited the town. One night this week, more than 30 new volunteers showed up to the opening of a new campaign office just outside Roanoke.</p> <p>And, yesterday, the man himself - the first visit from a presidential candidate to Roanoke since JFK in 1960. In contrast, Republicans are still waiting for a high-profile visit. And it's not clear that they would be overjoyed to see McCain anyway. Most of the people I spoke to at a Republican vice-presidential debate-watching party had not voted for McCain in the primaries, but had been energised by the nomination of Sarah Palin.</p> <p><strong>Hard fight</strong><br>\"Republicans were OK with McCain, but not excited,\" explained James Mixon, sporting a badge saying \"Sarah!\" with the words \"McCain and Palin\" much smaller underneath. </p> <p>\"He's come on strong since then and by nominating Palin he's indicated to conservatives that he's serious.\"</p> <p>Republicans are not used to fighting this hard in Virginia - a state that has not voted Democrat in more than 40 years. One man confided that he believed McCain could not win the presidency if he didn't take the state. </p> <p>Roanoke is a pretty town, sitting in a valley between the Appalachians and the Blue Ridge mountains, divided by route 581 from north to south, the railroad tracks from east to west and by race and class throughout.</p> <p>Crudely speaking, the south-east is poor and white, the south-west is affluent and white, the north-west is black, and the north-east more of a mix.</p> <p>The same things that dominate the national political conversation play out locally, only differently. Economically, the area has never experienced the highs or lows of the national booms and busts. But they are still feeling it. The food bank has seen a 9% increase in those seeking assistance. Last week the state announced it would axe 1,400 jobs. The week before the nearby university, Virginia Tech, raised its tuition fees by 11%.</p> <p>Healthcare is also a big issue here. Once a railroad town, Roanoke is now dominated by the healthcare giant Carilion. Around 40% of the judgments in Roanoke general district court since 2003 have been brought by Carilion, chasing people who cannot pay their medical bills.</p> <p>David Crimmins is one of them. He was treated for a herniated disc 10 years ago and ended up with a $5,000 bill. Crimmins, who earns $15,000 a year, did not show up to court to challenge Carilion's action. </p> <p>\"I didn't see the point,\" he said. \"They're going to do whatever they want anyhow.\" The debt to Carilion was deducted from his wages until the company finally relented.</p> <p>The hospital is also deducting owed money from his sister's wages and his mother's pay packet. So many are the debt collection actions before the court that it sets aside one day a week just to deal with healthcare. They call it Carilion day.</p> <p>Otherwise, Democrats here are more likely to talk about the war, and Republicans more about tax, socialism and guns. With the registration deadline past, Democratic areas have seen at least double the increase in new voters compared with Republican areas. The task now is to get them out.</p> <p><strong>Mood shift</strong><br>And in some quarters, excitement at the possibility of Obama's election has been tinged with a sense of alienation from his campaign. Leaders in the black community believe the young, white out-of-town staffers are ignoring their local knowledge and connections which could result in an under-performance of the black vote. African Americans comprise a quarter of the city and a fifth of the state - Obama cannot win the city or the state without them.</p> <p>\"The older crowd just don't connect with a 20-year-old white person telling a 50-year-old black person what to do,\" said Onzlee Ware, the Virginia House delegate for Roanoke. \"Especially how to run their own communities. And then they get discouraged and go back to their communities.\"</p> <p>Ware said there was time to turn things round by election day. If there was a doubt in his mind about Obama winning, he was not showing it. </p> <p>It's a mark of the mood shift these last three weeks. The pauses are shorter. The polls show the Democrat nomination up. And yesterday lunchtime there were no whispered conversations at Pop's. The owners had shut up shop and gone to see Obama.</p> <h2><strong>Local Voices</strong></h2> <p>\u2022 <strong>Onzlee Ware</strong>, delegate to the Virginia legislature </p> <p>Ware is the most senior black politician in town. He is convinced that Obama will win. He said: \"The thing I like about this campaign is that America has said that there's an entire America. Not just a white male America. But a black America and a female America.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Chelsea Shinneman</strong>, Obama volunteer </p> <p>Shinneman is not so much a volunteer for Obama as an evangelist for him. She devotes pretty much every waking hour when she's not working to the campaign, so much so that her voicemail message also gives the Obama <br>office number.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>David Crimmins</strong>, painter </p> <p>David Crimmins, a painter, lives with his girlfriend, Melissa Hicks, who has never left Virginia, and their two boys. They want McCain to win. \"He's got the experience,\" he says. Hicks says she does not know why she does not like Obama but it is not because he is black.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Anna Robertson</strong>, owner of Pop's Ice-cream and Soda Bar </p> <p>Robertson sends both her children to the local school, where half the pupils are black. \"People would ask me how I felt about my kids going to school in Roanoke as though the schools were really bad. The racial element of it is always unspoken. But it's there.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Thursday October 23 2008. The accidental removal of a zero led us to say that Virginia had not voted for a Democratic president for more than four years. That should have been 40 years. This has been changed.</p>",
  "<p>We know election day is approaching when Republicans start screaming about voter fraud, but the McCain campaign has reached a new low and the death rattle of the Republican party has entered its last violent spasm. At this week's debate John McCain accused the Association of Community Organisations for Reform Now (Acorn) of \"one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy\". His running mate, Sarah Palin, warned that they were trying to \"steal this election\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/14/uselections2008-republicans-acorn\">These kinds of allegations</a> are absurd and obviously false and the McCain campaign knows it. It is McCain himself that is damaging to our democracy because it calls into question the legitimacy of our election process in a deceitful way. </p> <p>Voter fraud and voter registration fraud are two different things and they are being deliberately conflated for political purposes. Voter fraud is simply bogus. Study after study, and major nationwide enforcement efforts by the department of justice and other enforcement agencies in the states have never, ever produced any evidence of anything more than a handful of cases, and I mean two or three, of actual voter fraud. The failure of many US attorneys to actually find cases of voter fraud to prosecute was the motivation for Karl Rove to push a scheme to fire nine of them and the resulting scandal ultimately led to attorney general <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/27/usa.marktran\">Alberto Gonzalez's resignation</a>. </p> <p>Voter registration fraud is real, but the kinds of allegations about Acorn are actually frauds perpetrated on Acorn and not the political process. Organisations that engage in voter registration drives are required by law to submit every registration form that they receive, no matter how obviously fraudulent the information. That law is in place as an extremely important protection for the process so that organisations are not able to go on a mass registration drive and then throw out all the Republican registrants or Democratic registrants before they submit the forms to the state government. They have a responsibility to flag those forms that they believe are fraudulent or invalid, but they cannot disqualify them on their own. For example, <a href=\"http://www.acorn.org/\">Acorn</a> goes and registers 100,000 people in Ohio out of which they identify 5,000 registration forms that are clearly phony that they flag, but they have to turn them in anyway. Then Republicans go around spreading malicious stories about Acorn turning in thousands of fraudulent registrations, but they know Acorn is required by law to turn them in and they know that those registrants will never be added to the voter rolls.</p> <p>Acorn is uniquely susceptible to these kinds of problems because it engages in the questionable practice of paying its organisers by the number of people they register. I can understand why they do this \u2013 to give unemployed or low-income people a paying job \u2013 but it opens them up to fraud perpetrated on them by paying for sham registrations. They believe that the multi-layered system of first flagging questionable registration forms and then having the voting agencies provide further checks is adequate protection against actual fraudulent registrants ending up on the voter rolls and the benefits of helping these people earn a living outweigh these risks. </p> <p>The reason why voter registration fraud does not lead to actual voter fraud is that voter fraud is hard and voter registration fraud is usually very transparent. The charges flying around right now \u2013 people registering as Mickey Mouse, or a guy filling out 73 registration forms \u2013 are simply not credible as voter fraud. It would require us to believe that an election board would place Mickey Mouse on the rolls and poll workers would then allow someone to vote who is claiming to be Mickey Mouse, or to allow the same person to vote numerous times. That is just ridiculous and impossible to imagine occurring in the real world. </p> <p>For systemic voter fraud to occur, the organisers of such an effort would need hundreds if not thousands of people to participate in a massive conspiracy to show up at the polls claiming to be someone else (a felony) who had been fraudulently registered and placed on the rolls, they will often now need to have a government issue photo ID with that other person's information (another felony), then actually vote for the chosen candidate in a secret ballot, and then keep this massive clandestine conspiracy hidden in the face of numerous investigations designed to uncover that very situation. It's even harder for systemic mail-in voting fraud because the ballots can only be mailed to each voter's registered address meaning that hundreds of households would need to be part of this conspiracy that adds mail fraud to its list of felonies. It's more likely that Mickey Mouse would be allowed to vote than systemic voter fraud to occur undetected.</p> <p>Republican officials know this. They know that this election cycle has seen an unprecedented surge in new voter registrations and that those registrations have been disproportionally Democratic. They are raising the spectre of imaginary voter fraud to further their efforts to disqualify a large number of those registrations through cumbersome requirements that elections boards cannot complete by November 4 to fix a problem that does not exist. It is a deliberate effort to delegitimise both their probable defeat and, combined with despicable efforts to portray Obama as a supporter of terrorism, an Obama presidency. Should Obama win, a large percentage of the country will think that he is a terrorist supporter who conspired to steal the election, that will present a real governing problem for Obama. The reason they will believe that outrageous suggestion is that the Republican presidential and vice-presidential candidates have told them it is true. This from the man who claims to put country first.</p>",
  "<p>The UN's chief climate change negotiator has predicted that a Barack Obama victory next month would jump-start progress toward global limits on carbon emissions.</p> <p>Dr Rajendra Pachauri, head of the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC), said yesterday that other nations would solidify their position on emissions caps after watching how the new American president approaches the issue.</p> <p>\"If Obama is elected, and this seems more likely, this would create positive momentum\" for the December climate talks in Poland and next year's round in Copenhagen, Pachauri told Bloomberg News.</p> <p>The IPCC's mandate states that its reports on climate science should remain \"policy neutral\", giving a ring of the unexpected to Pachauri's remarks on the US political scene. He made no similar remarks about the climate-change policy of Republican nominee John McCain.</p> <p>The Poland talks are likely to determine whether nations can agree on a climate pact to replace the Kyoto protocol by next year's deadline. Environmental activists and Yvo de Boer, chief of the UN climate secretariat, have urged the newly elected US president \u2013 whether Obama or McCain \u2013 to commit to attending the Poland meeting.</p> <p>Neither candidate has publicly stated whether Poland is on his agenda, but Obama has vowed that if Congress does not act on climate change within 18 months after the election, he would use his presidential regulatory powers to set emissions limits.</p> <p>The announcement on climate regulation, from Obama energy adviser Jason Grumet, came in a separate interview with Bloomberg News. Grumet said the short timeframe for a new global climate accord \u2013 the Copenhagen talks end in December 2009 \u2013 would influence Obama's decision-making.</p> <p>\"We cannot have a meaningful impact in the international discussion until we develop a meaningful domestic consensus,\" Grumet said. \"So he'll move quickly.''</p> <p>Under George Bush, the US environmental protection agency (EPA) has refused to use its power under the Clean Air Act to curb emissions. Several state governments and environmental groups successfully challenged that stance before the US supreme court, but the Bush administration has postponed action until the next president arrives.</p> <p>An Obama administration's decision to use the EPA as a regulator of carbon emissions would represent a stark turnabout from the Bush years. Advisers to McCain have suggested that he would prefer Congress to drive American action on climate change to an approach steered by the EPA.</p>",

She is not as thoughtful or persuasive as Joe the Plumber, who in an extended cable interview Thursday made a better case for the Republican ticket than the Republican ticket has made. In the past two weeks she has spent her time throwing out tinny lines to crowds she doesn't, really, understand. This is not a leader, this is a follower, and she follows what she imagines is the base, which is in fact a vast and broken-hearted thing whose pain she cannot, actually, imagine. She could reinspire and reinspirit; she chooses merely to excite. She doesn't seem to understand the implications of her own thoughts.</p> <p>No news conferences? Interviews now only with friendly journalists? You can't be president or vice president and govern in that style, as a sequestered figure. This has been Mr. Bush's style the past few years, and see where it got us. You must address America in its entirety, not as a sliver or a series of slivers but as a full and whole entity, a great nation trying to hold together. When you don't, when you play only to your little piece, you contribute to its fracturing.</p> <p>In the end the Palin candidacy is a symptom and expression of a new vulgarization in American politics. It's no good, not for conservatism and not for the country. And yes, it is a mark against John McCain, against his judgment and idealism.</p> </blockquote> <p>It's noteworthy for a conservative to say this. Dowd <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/15/opinion/15dowd.html\">already hinted at</a> the coming battle between Brooks-Noonan conservatism and Kristol conservatism. If McCain loses, this will be fun, fun, fun to watch, except for the part where E.cuda gets her AEI fellowship and starts giving lectures around town on foreign policy and the first bigfoot pundit scratches his beard and remarks upon her \"newfound maturity.\"<br></p>",
  "<p>We could have seen this disgraceful episode coming. It was only a matter of time before one of the \"great citizens\" McCain says attend his rallies physically attacked a member of the working press instead of merely jeering and taunting the media pack.</p> <p>From the Greensboro (NC) News-Record, for which reporter Joe Killian <a href=\"http://blog.news-record.com/staff/capblog/archives/2008/10/report_from_pal.shtml\">covered</a> Sarah Palin's rally yesterday:</p> <blockquote> <p>I sidled up to one of the Obama supporters and asked why they were there, what they were trying to accomplish.

His face was turning red. \"Yeah, that 's real funny\u2026\" he said.</p> <p>And then he kicked the back of leg, buckling my right knee and sending me sprawling onto the ground.</p> </blockquote> <p>I will let News-Record writer Mark Brinker sum it up:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>After today I'm wondering - and this is just wondering at this point - whether Republicans aren't in some respect giving their supporters license for this sort of crap. If the story you peddle is that your guys are the good guys and all those who stand against them are the bad guys, and the \"liberal media\" is in that second column, might there be a message there \u2013 even if it is one that is misconstrued and carried to a stupid extreme in some cases?</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://browse.theguardian.com/search?search=joe+plumber&amp;sitesearch-radio=guardian&amp;go-guardian=Search\">controversy swirling around the faux plumber</a> Joe Wurzelbacher raises serious questions about the competence of John McCain's staff. In Wednesday night's debate with Barack Obama, the beleaguered McCain repeatedly referred to the semi-apocryphal figure \"Joe the Plumber\", a putatively salt-of-the-earth type whose economic future would be imperiled by Obama's tax policies. An Ohio man who had confronted Obama on the tax issue a few days earlier, Joe the Faux Plumber tried to pass himself off as an entrepreneur who was terrified that Obama's draconian tax hikes might render this quest impossible. He was, in short, the face of the Common Man.</p> <p>Like Davy Crockett, who killed himself a bear when he was only three, but tried to sneak out of the Alamo gussied up as a woman, like George Armstrong Custer, the fearless Injun Fighter the Sioux referred to as \"Killer of Women\", like Bill O'Reilly, the tough-as-nails talk show host who loves to trumpet his blue-collar roots, even though he grew up in a cute little New York suburb and his father was an accountant, Joe the Plumber has now been exposed as a complete fraud. He is not a licensed plumber. He does not earn enough money to be affected by Obama's tax policies. He does not have the scratch to be setting himself up in business. He is not a free-thinking independent who has yet to make up his mind which candidate he will cast his vote for; he is a registered Republican. Worst of all, his name is not even Joe; it is Samuel. He is, as my father Joe used to put it, as phony as a three-dollar bill.</p> <p>There is nothing wrong with being as phony as a three-dollar bill. It is, in fact, a rich American tradition. But there is something unnerving about a supposedly sophisticated political organisation that trumpets the dodgy virtues of grassroots phonies when millions of authentic working-class people could have handled the mythological chores perfectly well. All across America, there are plumbers named Joe and Jim and Jack and Mike and Dan and Dave and Ed and Fred whom the McCain campaign could have recruited to be their mascot. </p> <p>In my own family, there was Joe the truck driver, Joe the postman, Bill the typewriter salesman, and Johnny the jack-of-all trades. Right here in my own neighborhood, I can point to Tony the deliveryman, Vinny the postman, Charley the cook, Tony the token collector. Any one of these guys qualifies as a real-life working class hero. Instead of them, McCain's people went out and corralled themselves a 24-carat phony. What's more, they found themselves a phony who doesn't even pay his taxes on time. This strongly suggests that nobody in the McCain camp has ever met a working-class person before; they think anybody with a shaved head and a hoody must be \"authentic\". </p> <p>Which is yet another reason why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/17/uselections2008-barackobama\">McCain is not winning</a> this election. The American people do not want their country run by amateurs. Any more than they want their toilets repaired by amateurs.</p>",
  "<p>I liked David Brooks' column today, but why wouldn't I since it bore some resemblance to something one might, in some way, call a quasi-endorsement of Obama:</p> <blockquote> <p>But other candidates are propelled by what some psychologists call self-efficacy, the placid assumption that they can handle whatever the future throws at them. Candidates in this mold, most heroically F.D.R. and Ronald Reagan, are driven upward by a desire to realize some capacity in their nature. They rise with an unshakable serenity that is inexplicable to their critics and infuriating to their foes...</p> <p>... He doesn't have F.D.R.'s joyful nature or Reagan's happy outlook, but he is analytical. That's why this William Ayers business doesn't stick. He may be liberal, but he is never wild. His family is bourgeois. His instinct is to flee the revolutionary gesture in favor of the six-point plan.</p> <p>This was not evident back in the \"fierce urgency of now\" days, but it is now. And it is easy to sketch out a scenario in which he could be a great president. He would be untroubled by self-destructive demons or indiscipline. With that cool manner, he would see reality unfiltered. He could gather \u2014 already has gathered \u2014 some of the smartest minds in public policy, and, untroubled by intellectual insecurity, he could give them free rein. Though he is young, it is easy to imagine him at the cabinet table, leading a subtle discussion of some long-term problem.</p> </blockquote> <p>To be sure, there are a couple of \"to be sure\" grafs, just so they don't really throw him out of the club for good. But it's lot more positive than anything he's written about McCain lately.</p> <p>On the general subject of candidates' personality types, I read something recently that reminded me of <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-tomasky21dec21,0,6791695.story?coll=la-opinion-rightrail\">a piece I wrote for the LATimes</a> way back in December 2006 called \"Obama, the anti-Bush.\" I argued that it was the right time for Obama to run because his was an opposite personality type to Bush's, and that recent history showed that after four or eight years of a president with X personality traits, voters often turn to a guy who was the opposite:</p> <blockquote> <p>If my theory is correct, then 2008, coming directly off of Bush's tenure, will be exactly the right time for Obama to run. His themes and his personality \u2014 his agreeable nature and penchant for self-contemplation, so utterly unlike the incumbent's petulant, unreflective swagger \u2014 will be uniquely in demand in 2008 in a way they just might not be in 2012 or 2016.</p> </blockquote> <p>If I say so meself -- not bad for December 2006, eh?<br></p>",
  "<p><strong>Who is running? </strong><br>Democratic senator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> of Illinois and Republican senator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> of Arizona are the major party candidates. Their vice-presidential running mates are Delaware senator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> and Alaska governor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a>, respectively. </p> <p>Also running are Ralph Nader, the liberal consumer advocate whom Democrats blame with spoiling the 2000 election by siphoning votes from Al Gore and Cynthia McKinney, a former Democratic congresswoman from Georgia who is running on the Green party ticket. Former Georgia Republican congressman Georgia Bob Barr is running on the Libertarian ticket, hoping in part to win over conservative gadfly Ron Paul's backers.<br> <strong>How were Barack Obama and John McCain chosen as their parties' nominees? </strong><br>They were nominated by a vote of delegates to their respective national conventions in the late summer. They earned the support of those delegates by winning the long series of primary caucuses and elections held in the winter and spring. The Democratic nomination also need to be secured by the allegiance of party insiders and elected officials known as \"superdelegates\". <strong>So whoever gets the most votes on November 4 wins?</strong> <br>No. US presidential elections are awarded to the winner of what is known as the electoral college. Under the system, each state is allocated anywhere from three to 55 votes according to its population. </p> <p>The winner of the popular vote wins a state's electoral votes - with two exceptions, Maine and Nebraska, which award electoral votes by district. The candidate that wins 270 electoral votes takes the White House. <br> <strong>What happens if the winner of the electoral college has tallied fewer popular votes? </strong><br>This has happened three times in US history, most recently in 2000. Under the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/constitutionandcivilliberties\">US Constitution</a>, the presidency nevertheless goes to the candidate who wins the electoral college. <br> <strong>What are the most important states?</strong><br>California, New York and Texas offer the most electoral votes, with 55, 31 and 34 respectively. But those mammoth lodes are not up for grabs: the first two states are safely Democrat, and Texas has voted Republican every year since 1976. The candidates typically spend most of their time in a handful of large \"swing states\" that could vote either way, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/florida\">Florida</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ohio\">Ohio</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a>. <br> <strong>When do Americans vote?</strong><br>Election day is November 4, but many states allow voters to cast a ballot before then.  <strong>Why vote early?</strong> <br>Voters like early voting because it adds convenience and precludes having to wait on a long queue at the polls. This year, the Obama campaign is encouraging supporters to vote early to mitigate the chances of a late McCain surge in momentum. Research shows early voting does not dramatically increase turnout, as early voters would have cast a ballot on election day anyway.  <strong>How many Americans vote?</strong> <br>US citizens must be at least 18 years old and be registered with their local elections supervisor in order to vote. In 2004, 64% of voting-age citizens cast a ballot, up from 60% in 2000. This year Americans are expected to vote in record numbers, in large part because Obama has energised young voters and African-Americans in unprecedented levels. </p> <p><strong>What is the vice-president's role in the campaign? </strong><br>Vice-presidents run alongside presidential candidates on the party ticket. They have few official governing duties under the Constitution, and it is often joked that the most important day in a vice-president's career is the day he (or she) is brought onto the campaign. During the campaign, vice-presidential running mates are often tasked with attacking the record and character of the opposing presidential candidate, and this year Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Sarah Palin have embraced that role.  <strong>What does the president actually do? </strong><br>The president is commander in chief of the US military, sets foreign policy and negotiates treaties, oversees dozens of executive agencies and departments, signs bills into law and submits a budget to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/congress\">US Congress</a>. </p> <p>The president also appoints federal judges including new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/supremecourt\">US supreme court</a> justices. From the White House \"bully pulpit\", the president can wield extraordinary influence over legislation. <br> <strong>Who can run for president? </strong><br>The Constitution states only that the president must be a \"natural born citizen\", at least 35 years old and have resided in the US for 14 years.  <strong>John McCain was born in the Panama Canal zone. Is he a \"natural born citizen\"? </strong><br>The term has been widely interpreted to mean people born in the US, although the Constitution does not define it. </p> <p>Politicians in Washington are in broad agreement, however that McCain is a natural born citizen because he was born on a US military base in a US territory and his father was in the US navy. The Senate in May passed a resolution affirming that McCain is eligible to be president. <br> <strong>My friend in America wants to run for president. How does he go about doing this?</strong> <br>It is very, very difficult to run for the highest office in the nation. With the noteworthy exception of Barack Obama, serious presidential contenders have typically spent decades positioning themselves for a White House run, building political support by winning lower office, campaigning for other candidates, assembling coalitions of supporters and financiers, and mapping an electoral college strategy. </p> <p>Presidents and major-party nominees often fail their first attempt. Richard Nixon lost to John Kennedy in 1960 and spent the next eight years out of office, plotting his return to power in 1968. John McCain sought the Republican nomination in 2000 but lost to George Bush. He soon began positioning himself for this race. <br> <strong>How did Barack Obama manage to put himself in contention after less than three years in the Senate and eight years in the Illinois legislature? </strong><br>Obama first gained national attention in 2004 as a candidate for Senate in Illinois. He made a well-received speech at the Democratic convention that year, and struck party faithful with his charisma and his call for an end to divisive partisan and racial politics. </p> <p>But his relative lack of experience was a top issue for his opponents for the Democratic nomination. <br> <strong>Running for president sounds expensive. How much have the candidates spent so far?</strong> <br>Up until the end of August, McCain and the Republican party had spent $197.4m on the campaign. Obama and the Democrats had spent $391.4m.</p> <p><strong>How do they raise so much money?</strong><br>An individual may donate only $2,300 per election to a presidential candidate, so the campaigns rely on \"bundlers\" - well-heeled and influential people who can gather checks from large numbers of wealthy associates on behalf of the campaign. Obama's campaign this year has raised large sums of money in small contributions from a broad network of supporters, while McCain's campaign has relied on a smaller number of big checks. The political parties may take up to $28,500 from an individual every calendar year, but the federal government restricts how much they can spend in coordination with the campaign.</p> <p><strong>McCain and Obama are both senators. Do candidates always hold this office? </strong><br>No. In fact, the last sitting senator elected president was John Kennedy in 1960. Americans prefer electing governors or former vice-presidents, largely because governors have executive experience that is in many ways analogous to the presidency. Former vice-presidents have already stood on the national and international stage.  <strong>What else is up for grabs? </strong><br>The whole of the House of Representatives and one-third of the 100-member Senate are elected every two years, so those seats are up on November 4. Plus 11 states will hold elections for governor.  <strong>I won! Now what? </strong><br>The next president will be sworn into office on January 20. In the meantime, the president-elect will this year have one of the most urgent transition periods in history because of the fast-changing turmoil in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>. The president-elect will immediately begin naming his cabinet and preparing to take the reins in the White House and in the executive agencies. <br> <strong>How much does the president get paid? </strong><br>The president is paid $450,000, including a $50,000 per year expense fund. </p> <p><strong>That does not sound like very much, considering the power and prestige of the job. </strong><br>The president does not have to pay rent, or for meals and transportation, and takes holiday at Camp David, a retreat in the mountains of Maryland. Also, former presidents make large sums on book deals and speaking fees.  <strong>The White House sounds like a pretty neat place to live. </strong><br>It is. It is one of the most secure places in the entire world. The 200-year old mansion has had several additions and renovations, and every president has put his own stamp on the interior. For the president's off-hours, the White House features a tennis court, jogging track, swimming pool, movie theatre and bowling alley.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain today kept on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/17/uselections2008-johnmccain\">Joe the Plumber</a>, showing he still hopes to gain some traction from the man a day after the world's news media exposed him as an unlicensed labourer who doesn't pay his taxes and would in fact likely benefit under Obama's tax plan.</p> <p>In Arlington, Virginia today, McCain said Obama had \"attacked\" Joe Wurzelbacher, and implied Wurzelbacher was suffering media and political scrutiny merely because he asked Obama a tough question. But it's McCain who transformed Wurzelbacher from an anonymous Toledo worker into a campaign gimmick.<br><br>McCain said:</p> <blockquote> <p>We had a good debate this week. You may have noticed -- there was a lot of talk about Senator Obama's tax increases and Joe the Plumber. Last weekend, Senator Obama showed up in Joe's driveway to ask for his vote, and Joe asked Senator Obama a tough question. I'm glad he did; I think Senator Obama could use a few more tough questions.</p> <p>The response from Senator Obama and his campaign yesterday was to attack Joe. People are digging through his personal life and he has TV crews camped out in front of his house. He didn't ask for Senator Obama to come to his house. He wasn't recruited or prompted by our campaign. He just asked a question. And Americans ought to be able to ask Senator Obama tough questions without being smeared and targeted with political attacks.</p> </blockquote> <p>McCain's complaint stretches the truth to the point of factual inaccuracy. After all, it was the McCain campaign who turned Wurzelbacher into campaign mascot in Wednesday's debate, though they did not \"recruit or prompt\" his question for Obama. Had McCain not used Wurzelbacher to criticise Obama's tax plan, the news media would never have taken the first interest in him. Obama meets hundreds of Americans every day.</p> <p>Does McCain think Americans cannot remember a debate two nights ago?</p> <p>Meanwhile, initial polling from <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com\">Gallup</a> shows Joe the Plumber hasn't helped McCain turn the election around. The <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/111241/Gallup-Daily-Little-Impact-From-Debate-Far.aspx\">latest tracking poll</a> has Obama ahead 50% to 43% percent, and \"shows little significant change as a result of the debate at this point.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lots of speculation about whether the purpose of Colin Powell's appearance on Meet the Press Sunday is for him to endorse Obama, like <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14665.html\">this</a> from Mike Allen at the Politico:</p> <p>Powell's unassailable national security credentials could sway voters who are vacillating about whether Obama is ready to be commander in chief, and his endorsement of the Illinois senator would make a national security emphasis by McCain in the election's closing days extremely difficult.</p> <p>Powell, 71, a professional soldier for 35 years, has advised the last three Republican presidents.</p> <p>The general's camp is being coy about what he might or might not say on Sunday. But some McCain advisers suspect, without being sure, that Powell will endorse Obama.</p> <p>\"It's going to make a lot of news, and certainly be personally embarrassing for McCain,\" a McCain official said. \"It comes at a time when we need momentum, and it would create momentum against us.\"</p> <p>On matters like this, it's important to remember that there are two elections, the one going on in Real Land (where voters live) and the one taking place in Media Land. This would be a much bigger deal in Media Land, where it would dominate cable television coverage for two days and where McCain spokespeople would be forced to answer \"But doesn't this show...?\" questions. Fine by me!</p> <p>As for Real Land, I would say some impact, but relatively modest, among swing voters.</p> <p>But honestly: Powell's <em>what</em> national security credentials? After that UN presentation on Saddam's WMD? Such short memories.<br></p>",

  "<p>John McCain ceded, the country, if not the election as a whole, on <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/us/politics/16debate.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=third%20debate%20transcript&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin\">Wednesday night</a>. The Senator gave in to the trend he's been moving towards for weeks now. He decided to go with red states rather than blue, to choose creaky conservatism over forward looking bipartisanship. McCain chose the politics of anger and bias. He just let it all wash over him, and then he waded in it up to his neck and happily splashed around in it, oblivious to those around him. On Wednesday night John McCain gave up on independents and so-called Reagan Democrats entirely and threw his campaign to the fiery Republican base. It's a move that will fail him. <br> There were three crucial moments in the debate that speak best to McCain's final descent, and they all connect to the culture wars, the fires of which he and his running mate Sarah Palin have been stoking for more than a month now. The first we'd seen before \u2013 his <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/president/31001129.html?elr=KArks8c7PaP3E77K_3c::D3aDhUMEaPc:E7_ec7PaP3iUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aULPQL7PQLanchO7DiU\">reference to Obama creating \"class warfare,\"</a> a trope that is as out of touch as it is disingenuous (as one friend said to me last night during the debate, \"Does McCain think the Bush years haven't been about class warfare?\"). </p> <p>But the other two were new. This was the first time these presidential debates have touched Roe versus Wade. For a moment it seemed McCain would advance a centrist (if not entirely plausible) position, begging off <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kari-lundgren/catholics-shouldnt-trust_b_135393.html\">the idea of a litmus test for Supreme Court</a> judges. And then with a grimace and an eye roll he mocked the idea of granting women abortion exceptions for the health of the mother. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_CxQzm42hE\">\"Health\" he sneered</a>, derisively, and made little air quotes with his fingers. And with that, he lost all those centrist, mildly, or avowedly, pro-choice women in America who, yes, care about the health of the mother.<br> It was also the first time that McCain has been asked to address, in front of Obama, allowing the general level of character assassination \u2013 beyond the construct of the ridiculous Weatherman links \u2013 to escalate past the typical election year sludge into the Rovian territory it has wandered into of late. It was a chance for McCain to distance himself from some of the scarier elements that have popped up at his rallies recently \u2013 the people who scream \"kill [Obama]\" in the audience or \"terrorist\" that have even seemed to <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=188473&amp;title=10,000-mccainiacs\">panic McCain</a>. Instead he <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQfkZF20YwQ&amp;feature=related\">made it worse</a>. Here were the crucial lines:<br> </p> <blockquote> <p>Obama: At some of the rallies that your running mate was holding, in which all the Republican reports indicated were shouting, when my name came up, things like \"terrorist\" and \"kill him,\" and that you're running mate didn't mention, didn't stop, didn't say \"Hold on a second, that's kind of out of line.\" \u2026 We can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, John, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we...</p> <p>McCain: We do and I hope...</p> <p>Obama: ... talking about it this evening. But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists, then we're not talking about issues. </p> <p>McCain: Let me just say categorically I'm proud of the people that come to our rallies. Whenever you get a large rally of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people, you're going to have some fringe peoples. You know that. And I've \u2013 and we've always said that that's not appropriate. But to somehow say that group of young women who said \"Military wives for McCain\" are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything - and those veterans that wear those hats that say \"World War Two, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,\" I'm not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they're great citizens. And I'm not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally \u2013 there's a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies, Senator Obama, that I'm not happy about either.</p> </blockquote> <p>This was completely specious. Obviously Obama wasn't deriding veterans in hats or military wives for McCain. It was nonsensical. And with that moment McCain lost his chance to take the high road, to try to undo some of the more egregious scenes at Sarah Palin's rallies. He might have said, I'm proud of those veterans and military wives for McCain who come to my rallies, but yes, of late there were a few horrible things shouted, or asked, and I repudiate those jeers. He was pointedly asked to distance himself from those that seem ready to burn a cross on the lawn of the White House, and McCain couldn't bring himself to do it.</p>",

  "<p>Both John McCain and Barack Obama tout their green credentials on the campaign trail, but today their frequent absences from Congress doomed them to abysmal ratings on a leading US environmental group's annual scorecard.</p> <p>The League of Conservation Voters has ranked the environmental commitment of members of Congress for 37 years on its annual scorecards, which tally votes that legislators take on green issues. Missed votes detract from one's score, however, which proved bad news for Obama and McCain.</p> <p>Obama missed nearly all of the League's environmental \"key votes\" this year due to his whirlwind campaign schedule, earning an 18% green rating. His score during 2007, when a primary battle against Hillary Clinton also pulled Obama away from Washington, was 67%.</p> <p>But even those diminished rankings were better than McCain's. The Republican nominee, who depicts himself as a conservationist, got a 0% score for the second straight year after missing every vote tallied by the League.</p> <p>Neither Obama nor McCain voted on the US Senate's climate change legislation, which was defeated in a test vote in June. Although both men submitted public letters declaring that they would have backed the carbon-emissions plan, the absence still counted against their score for the League's purposes.</p> <p>Even if the presidential nominees had shown up to vote on the climate proposal, however, it still would have fallen 10 votes short of passage.</p> <p>Tiernan Sittenfeld, the League's legislative director, noted ruefully that Congress had scored a promising environmental victory last year, agreeing to increase automobile fuel efficiency standards for the first time in decades.</p> <p>\"The success of 2007 should have led to even more progress in 2008,\" Sittenfeld added in a statement, \"but a vocal minority of big-oil allies instead turned the year into a series of missed opportunities and major steps backward.\"</p> <p>Members of Congress who seek the White House commonly miss the overwhelming majority of legislative votes while campaigning across the US. John Kerry missed so many Senate votes during his bid to unseat George Bush in 2004 that one government watchdog group tried to force him to give back his congressional salary.</p> <p>But rarely do those missed votes make the difference between success and failure for major legislation. When a package of clean-energy tax credits came within one vote of passage in December, McCain was the only senator missing from the Capitol \u2013 although he was in Washington at the time. </p> <p>McCain joined David Vitter, a Republican from Louisiana, as the only senators receiving 0% ratings from the League this year. Seventy members of the House of Representatives earned zeroes. </p> <p>Among the senators receiving perfect 100% scores, all but one are Democrats. The exception to that trend is Susan Collins of Maine, whom the League has endorsed in her difficult re-election fight against Democratic challenger Tom Allen.</p>",
  "<p>Tiny Fey has won laughs playing Sarah Palin, and now America will see if Palin can win votes by appearing alongside her.</p> <p>The vice-presidential candidate, whose public image has been shaped - and not necessarily for the better - by the Emmy-winning comedienne's portrayal of her on Saturday Night Live, is scheduled to appear on the comedy programme this weekend.</p> <p>According to the Associated Press, the Alaska governor will make a guest appearance on the show hosted by actor Josh Brolin, star of Oliver Stone's new biopic W.</p> <p>The long-running NBC staple is a favoured stop for presidential candidates \u2013 John McCain once hosted it and Barack Obama made a brief cameo during the campaign.</p> <p>Thanks to Fey's send-up of Palin, the show has seen a revival in relevance, and recently began running a Thursday evening special edition of its \"Weekend Update\" news satire. Fey in some cases has used Palin's words verbatim, notably from a televised interview with newswoman Katie Couric, to devastating effect, drawing the public's attention Palin's apparent lack of command of national and international affairs.</p> <p>McCain spokeswoman Jill Hazelbaker confirmed to the Associated Press that Palin will be on the show, but offered no details of her performance.</p> <p>Palin has said she is a fan of Fey, the show's first female lead writer, and has quipped that she is happy to lend the show new material.</p>",
  "<p>For Barack Obama, it may be better to be grey above the ears than wet behind them.</p> <p>His newly salt-and-pepper pate was plainly visible during Wednesday night's debate, and the candidate joked about the change last night at a charity dinner in New York City last night.</p> <p>\"Hillary Clinton is one of the toughest and most formidable presidential candidates in history,\" he said. \"She's broken barriers, she's inspired millions, she is the primary reason I have all this grey in my hair now.\"</p> <p>The sprightly hopeful who wowed the crowd at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston has matured into a serious and deliberate campaigner - and, with that maturity comes signs of age.</p> <p>The specks of silver may not be all bad for Obama.</p> <p>\"Obama's emerging grey definitely closes the gap experientially between him and McCain, at least in the public perception,\" said Simon Doonan, creative director for Barney's New York. \"I'm sure L'Oreal are very disappointed.\"</p> <p>Doonan noted that the to-dye-or-not-to-dye decision is much easier for men than women: \"The guys get off easy because they cannot dye it and achieve gravitas, whereas the chicks are all screwed because if they don't dye it they're an old hag and if they do dye it they're duplicitous.\"</p> <p>The life of a sitting president is famously trying, and years in the White House dramatically age the men who hold high office. Bill Clinton emerged from the White House in 2001 white-haired after eight years in the Oval Office and needed open-heart surgery just a few years later. George Bush's locks have similarly faded in the last eight years.</p> <p>Since Obama officially announced his presidential bid in February 2007, Obama has celebrated two birthdays, and watched his young daughters grow.</p> <p>Presidential candidates say the rigours of managing a campaign - with, in Obama's case, a nearly $400m budget and a staff of thousands across the country - is good practice for managing the White House. This year's campaign has been especially difficult because it began earlier, than usual and Clinton forced Obama to compete for the Democratic nomination into June. In 2004, John Kerry had the nomination sewn up by mid-March, giving him three month of rest Obama couldn't enjoy.</p> <p>While Obama's staff manage the schedule, and his personal attendants make sure he is fed and his clothes are cleaned and pressed, Obama must nevertheless spend countless hours each day in the public eye, chatting with voters, raising money and answering reporters' questions. Any conversation can become fodder for the Republicans and for the 24-hour news media - witness Obama's interaction with \"Joe the Plumber\" in Toledo, Ohio. </p> <p>Obama has been hitting the campaign trail full force for more than a year, and has taken only two brief breaks with his family, in the US Virgin Islands and Hawaii.</p> <p>\"You know what I got for Christmas?\" Obama asked in December, \"Eight hours sleep\".</p>",

The Arizona senator was funnier than Obama, and appeared at ease in a room packed with Democrats.</p> <p>\"There are signs of hope even in the most unexpected places, even in this room full of proud Manhattan Democrats,\" he said. \"I can't shake that feeling that some people here are pulling for me; I'm delighted to see you here tonight, Hillary.\"</p> <p>McCain also riffed on the lingering tension between Obama and the former president Bill Clinton.</p> <p>\"When Larry King asked President Clinton a couple weeks ago what was the delay and why wasn't he out there on the trail for Barack, Bill said his hands were tied until the end of the Jewish high holidays,\" McCain said, referring to the CNN talk show host.</p> <p>\"Now, you've got to admire that ecumenical spirit. I just know Bill would like to be out there now, stumping for Barack until the last hour of the last day. Unfortunately, he is constrained by his respect for any voters who might be observing the Zoroastrian new year.\"</p> <p>McCain quipped about his own wealth - in a well-publicised gaffe this summer McCain could not remember how many houses he owned - and referred to Joe the Plumber, his new campaign mascot.</p> <p>\"[Obama] claims that this honest, hardworking small businessman could not possibly have enough income to face a tax increase under the Obama plan,\" he said. \"What they don't know is Joe the Plumber recently signed a very lucrative contract with a wealthy couple to handle all the work on all seven of their houses.\"</p> <p>Before relinquishing the microphone to Obama, McCain played on the \"expectations game\", in which the campaigns engaged in the run-up to the debates this fall.</p> <p>\"Now, of course, it would be unfair - and even a little unkind - to put my opponent on the spot before he gets up here or to throw him off his game with unreasonably high expectations,\" McCain said. \"But I do need to warn you, ladies and gentlemen, you all are about to witness the funniest performance in history - Senator Obama, the microphone is all yours.\"</p> <p>Obama, who accepted the ribbing with laughs and broad smiles, poked fun at his own convention acceptance speech, which he delivered before more than 80,000 people at an outdoor football stadium on an elaborately constructed stage.</p> <p>\"I was originally told we'd be able to move this outdoors to Yankee Stadium,\" he said of the dinner. Then, pausing and surveying the room, he said: \"Could somebody tell me what happened to the Greek columns that I requested?\"</p> <p>He quipped that the Fox News channel, the conservative-leaning cable broadcaster that Democrats say repeats scurrilous rumours about Obama, reported he had fathered two African-American children \"in wedlock\".</p> <p>\"It is an honour to be here with Al Smith,\" Obama said, referring to the host of the dinner, the scion of the politician. \"I obviously never knew your great-grandfather, but from everything that Senator McCain has told me, the two of them had a great time together before Prohibition. Wonderful stories.\"</p> <p>He cracked wise about his middle name, Hussein, which some Republicans have used in an effort to paint him as a Muslim: \"I got my middle name from somebody who obviously didn't think I would ever run for president\"</p> <p>On his association with William Ayers, a 1960's-era radical with whom the Republicans insinuate Obama is close to, he said, \"John McCain is onto something. There was a point in my life when I started palling around with a pretty ugly crowd, I've got to be honest. These guys were serious deadbeats, they were lowlifes, they were unrepentant, no good punks. That's right, I've been a member of the United States senate.\"</p> <p>The two men had kind and respectful words for each other. Obama praised McCain's service in the Vietnam war, saying few Americans had served their country with \"the same honour and distinction\" as the Arizona senator, a former navy pilot who was a prisoner of war for more than five years in Vietnam.</p> <p>McCain said Obama was \"an impressive fellow in many ways\" and praised \"his great skill, energy and determination\". He noted that Obama was positioned to make history as the first African-American president, and said: \"I can't wish my opponent luck, but I do wish him well.\"</p>",
  "<p>The finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party, who is also a bid donor to McCain, is accused of vastly overcharging the US military for deliveries of fuel to Iraq over the last four years, the NYT <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/world/middleeast/17fuel.html?_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper&amp;oref=slogin\">reports</a>.</p> <p>The charge, against Harry Sargeant III, was made public by Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman in information he sent to the Pentagon. Sounds like brother Sargeant had some well-placed friends somewhere:</p> <blockquote> <p>In one case, the letter from Mr. Waxman, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, asserts that Mr. Sargeant's company submitted the highest of six bids, but received the contract anyway. In fact, Pentagon contracting officers complained that the company's prices were unreasonably high and initially said they could not justify giving the work to Mr. Sargeant.</p> <p>But for reasons the company was never able to explain, Mr. Waxman's letter indicates, no other American company was given an authorization to transport the fuel through Jordan. And when the United States Central Command declared that the need for the fuel was urgent, the Pentagon was forced to award the contract to Mr. Sargeant's company</p> </blockquote> <p>.</p> <p>Forced by whom? </p> <p>Anyway, the man who stands accused of war profiteering has raised more than $500,000 for McCain. Should make the evening newscasts across Florida.<br></p>",
  "<p>Despite the title, John Legend's third album finds him once again treading the line between soul and hip-hop with dexterity. There are plenty of highlights: Quickly, an urgent, aqueous duet with Brandy; No Other Love, on which Legend trades sweet everythings with Estelle over a relaxed reggae lope; Greenlight, whose skittery beats and swooning synths recall Kelis's 2004 hit, Millionaire (both, uncoincidentally, feature Andr\u00e9 3000). If You're Out There, meanwhile, finds Legend plunging bodily into political waters (it is also available as a free download from Barack Obama's website). References to \"change\", \"destiny\" and \"the future\" abound; the arrival, midway through, of surging chorales is reassuringly inevitable, as are the crashing power chords. It is unbelievably corny, in a very special American kind of way, but don't be surprised if you too get swept up in its grandeur on November 4. As on Legend's previous two efforts, his balladry can tend towards the beige, and oatmeal slow jams such as Cross the Line prove unmemorable; but the innate warmth of Legend's voice mostly carries his material.</p>",
  "<p>Poor old Henry Paulson. It's been a tough month to be in charge of the American economy. But after a series of screeching U-turns, he isn't exactly inspiring confidence among the country's big-brained financiers.</p> <p>Paulson's bald head and uncompromising manner have gained him the nickname Hammer. Since his appointment two years ago, he has seemed like a breath of pragmatism in the ideologically evangelical Bush administration.</p> <p>But the pugnacious former school football star has struggled to stay on top of the fast-moving credit crunch. Who would have thought the swashbuckling one-time Goldman Sachs chief would be suffering unfavourable comparisons with the dour Scottish solicitor running Britain's Treasury, Alistair Darling?</p> <p>Paulson's approach has been inconsistent, confused and reactive. In March, he organised a bail-out of Bear Stearns on the grounds that the failure of a major investment bank would have a \"systemic\" impact, with implications reverberating around the financial system. But he felt differently about Lehman Brothers, allowing it to go bankrupt last month. </p> <p>Stung by a subsequent plunge in the stockmarket, Paulson hurriedly went back into intervention mode by rescuing the insurer AIG. Days later, the authorities cajoled JP Morgan to step in when Washington Mutual collapsed.</p> <p>There's no real logic in that chain of events. The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, this week offered a rather confusing explanation of the decision to allow Lehman to collapse.</p> <p>\"A public-sector solution for Lehman proved infeasible, as the firm could not post sufficient collateral to provide reasonable assurance that a loan from the Federal Reserve would be repaid,\" said Bernanke. \"And the treasury did not have the authority to absorb billions of dollars of expected losses to facilitate Lehman's acquisition by another firm.\"</p> <p>That doesn't make much sense. The Fed has been willing to buy debt on the commercial paper market without solid collateral. And the authorities have opted to give unlimited guarantees on liabilities to secure takeovers of Bear Stearns and Wachovia.</p> <p>The debacle of America's banking bail-out has been another saga of jangled nerves and sweaty palms. Paulson started out with a $700bn plan to buy banks' distressed debts \u2014 a proposal which went down like a glass of sour milk on Capitol Hill. Paulson was adamantly opposed to a more radical approach of purchasing stakes in leading banks, citing negative precedents in Japan.</p> <p>\"The right way to do this is not going around and using guarantees or injecting capital, but to use market mechanisms,\" he told the Senate banking committee. It took weeks to get politicians to agree to this. But after all the political battling, it quickly became clear that the plan wasn't sufficient. </p> <p>This week, Paulson changed his mind by copying Britain with a $250bn fund to buy stakes in leading banks. As befits a Goldman Sachs alumni, he hasn't attached very stringent conditions. There is some mealy-mouthed language about forbidding executive bonuses that encourage \"excessive\" risk, and banks aren't allowed to raise their dividends (although they can maintain them at present levels). </p> <p>Quite how we got into this muddle is a mystery. Why didn't Paulson opt for stake purchases in the first place? It is tempting to conclude that he was deterred by the administration's ideological wariness of public ownership. Irrespective of motive, it was a serious error which contributed to a slow-motion stockmarket crash.</p> <p>In the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/22/opinion/22krugman.html?scp=2&amp;sq=krugman%20AND%20paulson%20AND%20smart%20guy&amp;st=cse\">the Nobel prize winning economist Paul Krugman</a> has been scathing: \"What, exactly, in the experience of the past year and a half \u2014 a period during which Mr Paulson repeatedly declared the financial crisis 'contained' and then offered a series of unsuccessful fixes \u2014 justifies the belief that he knows what he's doing?\"</p> <p>It wasn't that long ago that Paulson was being lauded in affectionate terms. Barrons <a href=\"http://blogs.barrons.com/stockstowatchtoday/2008/09/18/paulson-saving-the-free-world-on-an-aging-cell-phone\"> analysed his choice of mobile phone</a> (a Motorola Razr) under the headline \"Saving the world on an ageing cellphone\".</p> <p>In August, there were even suggestions <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/08/paulson-wont-st.html\"> that Paulson might stay </a> on to work his ministerial magic under the next president, whether it be Barack Obama or John McCain. I think we can now safely declare that possibility to be dead.</p> <p>Paulson has worked day and night to try to save the economy. At times, the 62-year-old has looked pale and drawn, and his voice has been hoarse. According to the Washington Post, <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/livecoverage/2008/09/treasury_confirms_paulson_fain.html\">he suffered a dizzy spell</a> at one point and had to be supported by New York's Democratic senator, Chuck Schumer. </p> <p>In three months' time, a new president will be inaugurated and Paulson will almost certainly be heading for retirement. When he leaves office, he can comfort himself with the proceeds of his Goldman Sachs shares, which he sold in 2006 for almost $700m. It's a good job he offloaded the stock on entering the government. The bank's share price has fallen by 27% under his stewardship of the US economy.</p>",
  "<p>Joe the Plumber enjoyed a brief but blazing turn in the media spotlight yesterday, the day after John McCain used the Toledo, Ohio worker as a foil for criticism of Barack Obama's tax policy at a debate. At campaign events yesterday, McCain and running mate Sarah Palin both invoked Joe Wurzelbacher in efforts to portray McCain as a champion of the middle class. Palin said in Maine that McCain is \"a leader who is going to Washington to work for Joe the plumber,\" while McCain declared in Pennsylvania that \"Joe's the man\" and was the \"real winner\" of the debate the previous night. But Joe himself is no average plumber - and according to some in the trade has not earned the title. Wurzelbacher is not a member of the local plumbers union, writes Ed Pilkington in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/17/uselections2008-johnmccain\">today's Guardian</a>, has no licence to practice the trade, and owes the government more than $1,000 in back taxes. Wurzelbacher says he does not need a licence because he works for someone else on residential property.</p> <p>Meanwhile, after being deemed the victor in Thursday's debates, Obama began moving aggressively into several more states long in Republican hands, Suzanne Goldenberg and Ewen MacAskill write in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/17/uselections2008-barackobama\">today's Guardian</a>. The campaign is taking advantage of its flush coffers and running advertisements in West Virginia, Kentucky and Georgia. Obama and running mate Joe Biden may campaign in Montana and South Dakota - once considered out of reach. Obama today warned his supporters not to get too cocky, reminding them he lost the January New Hampshire primary to Hillary Clinton despite late polls predicting a win.</p> <p>At the Alfred E Smith charity dinner in New York, white tie-clad Obama and McCain mocked each other before a crowd of media and political luminaries, including the mayor and governor of New York and senators Hillary Clinton and Charles Schumer. McCain joked that he had sacked his entire campaign staff and hired \"Joe the Plumber\" to replace them. Obama poked fun at his decision to move his Democratic convention speech to a football stadium. \"I was originally told we'd be able to move this outdoors to Yankee Stadium,\" he said of the dinner. Pausing and surveying the room, he said, \"Could somebody tell me what happened to the Greek columns that I requested?\"</p> <p>Also last night, McCain underwent a gruelling make-up appearance on David Letterman's television show, after cancelling a visit to the New York studio when the banking crisis broke out last month. Letterman, who had been visibly irritated by McCain's last-minute change of plans, pressed McCain on his attacks on Obama's association with Vietnam war-era radical William Ayers. \"Are they double-dating, are they going to dinner, what are they doing?\" Letterman asked. \"Are they driving across country?\" \"Maybe going to Denny's,\" an exasperated McCain replied, before jokingly threatening to raise Letterman's taxes if elected.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>McCain is in Florida today, while Palin holds rallies in Ohio and Indiana. McCain's daughter Meghan travels to three towns in Maine, holding a pizza lunch with supporters and a meeting at a pub. Obama is in Virginia. Hillary Clinton hits the trail for Obama in Youngstown, Ohio, hoping to rouse middle-class whites. Listen to see if McCain and Palin keep at Joe the Plumber, or if they abandon him after the revelations about his professional status and tax arrears.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Gallup's daily tracking poll showed Obama's lead has narrowed to 6 points, 49% to 43% for McCain, from 50% to 43% the day before. That result does not account for Wednesday night's debate. A poll in Pennsylvania by Muhlenberg College showed Obama ahead in the key swing state by 16 points, 53% to 37%. That poll also found that only 35% of Pennsylvania voters have a favourable opinion of McCain, compared to 53% for Obama. In Ohio, a Rasmussen poll shows the two candidates tied 49% to 49%.</p> <h2>Quotes of the day</h2> <p>John McCain at the Alfred E Smith dinner in New York City: \"Even in this room full of proud Manhattan Democrats, I can't shake the feeling that some people here are pulling for me. I'm delighted to see you here tonight, Hillary.\"<br>\"Don't boo now, just vote,\" Obama advised supporters in New Hampshire, after they reacted to his declaration that McCain wanted to \"turn the page\" on discussion of the economy.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/17/uselections2008-barackobama1\">Foreign poll favours Democrat but shows hostility to US</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/17/uselections2008-johnmccain1\">Community organisers stump McCain</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-johnmccain4\">Campaign diary: Joe the Plumber roundup</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/john-mccain-virginia-roanoke-campaign\">Five reasons why McCain's campaign is floundering</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/cartoon/2008/oct/17/obama-mccain-elections-debate\">Cartoon: Steve Bell on the Obama-McCain debate</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/16/AR2008101603436.html?hpid=opinionsbox1\">Washington Post: Barack Obama for President</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/mccain-and-obama-palling-around-must-be-the-al-smith-dinner/?hp\">NY Times: McCain and Obama Palling Around?

  "<p>A question. What adjective is most closely associated with Barack Obama on Google, and what epithet is linked with John McCain? Answers: \"professorial\" and \"fighter-pilot\", respectively. </p> <p>This is what the 2008 gladiatorial combat has boiled down to: mortarboards versus flying helmets. Swots versus warriors.</p> <p>The standard descriptions of Barack, in newspaper reports of the presidential debates, have been: \"cool\", \"detached\", \"wry\" and - time and again -\"professorial\". </p> <p>And McCain? \"Hot-tempered\" comes up routinely, as does \"aggressive\" (\"Grumpy McNasty\" has also been popular). </p> <p>\"Academic\", although not as dirty a word as \"liberal, is not something any politician wants strung round their neck. It suggests ivory-tower unworldliness. </p> <p>\"Professorial\", on the other hand, is what Orwell calls a \"plusword\". You can be a professor and worldly.</p> <p>Professors have not, of course, always been admired by real-world politicians. George Wallace was scathing about \"pointy-headed professors that can't park a bicycle straight\".</p> <p>Henry Kissinger (a Harvard prof in his early years) memorably declared that he would rather have as president of the United States anyone in the first 100 pages of the Boston telephone directory rather than someone on the Harvard faculty. No pointy-heads in the White House, thank you very much.</p> <p>None the less, \"professorial\" has worked powerfully for Obama in this keenly contested election. Why?<br> Four reasons suggest themselves: </p> <p>\u2022 First: do a free-association exercise on the word \"professorial\". What image comes to mind? My guess is: \"dignified white male\". To be blunt, \"professorial\" works against the stock associations of \"African-American\" - or less savoury variants of that term. It subliminally blanches the candidate.</p> <p>\u2022 The second reason, I suspect, is that American professors have scooped up all the Nobel prizes this month for science and social science. </p> <p>Particularly relevant is the economics award, won by Paul Krugman. Krugman is a distinguished professor at Princeton, a syndicated op-ed columnist on the New York Times, and a relentless critic of Bush's.</p> <p>\u2022 There's a feeling that whereas fighter-pilot aggression might help in the hills of Afghanistan, it's not going to get America out of the ditch into which George Bush (another ex-fighter pilot) and his deregulation policies have crashed his country. </p> <p>It's not dash and derring-do that's needed, but thoughtful reflection. Not warriors, but professors. Enter \"professorial\" Obama.</p> <p>Barack Obama is very brainy. An alumnus of Columbia and Harvard, he was president of the Harvard Law Review. He could easily have followed an academic track and, at 47, would surely by now have been, yes, a very distinguished professor, had he not elected, instead, to become the most powerful man in the world. If, that is, his country so elects.</p> <p>Time and again, Obama (unlike his opponent) has stressed how vital it is for working and middle-class Americans to be able to send their kids to college. </p> <p>What's the current package at an Ivy League institution? Around $50K a year. If you've got three children, and are in receipt of the national average income (under $50K, as it happens) what hope do you have of doing what Obama and his wife, in a more generous era, managed to do? The American dream is just too expensive, nowadays, for the Barack Obamas and Michelle Robinsons.</p> <p>Famously, Obama and his wife have barely finished paying their student loans. Democracy, Obama asserts - and demonstrates in his own career - depends as much on assisted access to higher education as on invading Middle Eastern oil-rich countries. Most professors would agree with him.</p> <p>\u2022 It used to be pastors who led the African-American community. Dr Martin Luther King broke the mould. He was a preacher with a PhD (no president of the US, incidentally, has had an earned, as opposed to an honorary, doctorate). Now black professors are moving into leadership roles.</p> <p>In spite of what I described above as the male-whiteness of the term, there are nowadays a significant number of African-American professors of both sexes among the very top echelon of \"public intellectuals\". </p> <p>They include: Cornel West III (Princeton); Henry Louis Gates Jr (Harvard); Houston A. Baker Jr (Vanderbilt); Toni Morrison (Princeton). And, of course, there is Condoleeza Rice (formerly president of Stanford, before that, a professor there). There is, in short, a black professoriate. And it is an increasingly powerful player in American public life. Obama slips easily into that company.</p> <p>If Obama wins - and the polls strongly suggest he will - it will be because of, not in spite of, his professorial demeanour. Professors, for the moment, are cool. And admired for being level-headed, not pointy-headed. Gaudeamus.</p>",
  "<p>According to early estimates nearly 60 million people in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/america\">America</a> tuned in to watch Wednesday's final <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselections2008\">presidential debate</a> between <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>. Now if that level of interest could translate into ticket sales for another political saga, Oliver Stone's new release <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126059/w\">W</a>, Lionsgate would have one of the biggest movies of all time on its hands. Back in reality, the pundits are projecting a three-day gross in the region of $10m from approximately 2,100 theatres.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgebush\">George Bush</a> biopic is unlikely to be the number one movie given that Fox is pulling out all the stops and launching Max Payne, a slick but absurd action romp based on a videogame starring Mark Wahlberg, in approximately 3,200 locations. Audiences want escapism in these harsh economic times and a man with blazing guns goes a lot further than a man with blazing ignorance. Wahlberg has proved he can open movies well with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/124583/happening\">The Happening</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/117802/shooter\">Shooter</a>, and Max Payne is expected to land in the $20m range.</p> <p>A top five berth is within W's grasp even though political films rarely do well in North America \u2013 notwithstanding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/michaelmoore\">Michael Moore</a>'s exception to the rule <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/100742\">Fahrenheit 9/11</a>, another Lionsgate release that remains the biggest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/documentary\">documentary</a> of all time. I hope the movie succeeds because it's well crafted and contains a commanding central performance from Josh Brolin, but it might struggle. The irony is that one of modern cinema's great agent provocateurs has turned out a remarkably measured movie that could fail to galvanise audiences because it doesn't tell us anything new.</p> <p>Brolin is truly captivating and gives us just the right amount of chuckle and smirk while imbuing a persona we think we know so well with a complexity that suggests Stone might want to revisit his subject in a decade or so. To his credit the director's empathetic portrait avoids overt manipulation and invites viewers to decide for themselves. But in an uncharacteristically polarised US political climate, many already know where they stand. Besides, what can compete with the sheer entertainment of watching <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> gaffes on YouTube? On that note, imagine if Stone had made a film about the Alaskan governor's formative years, interspersed with high-octane shots of moose hunting, after-hours classes in current affairs accompanied by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/116745/rocky.balboa\">Rocky</a> score, and soft-focus sequences where she hones the dark arts of demagoguery and winking. Now that would set the box office on fire.</p> <p>Disney's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126327/beverly.hills.chihuahua\">Beverly Hills Chihuahua</a> will get knocked off its perch by Max Payne after two weekends at the top. That won't dent its prospects too much: it's still the main <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/family\">family movie</a> in the top 10 \u2013 at least until Disney unleashes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126069/high.school.musical.3\">High School Musical 3: Senior Year</a> next weekend \u2013 and could reap a further $10m to bring it close to the $70m mark. Warner Bros' terrorism thriller <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126190/body.of.lies\">Body of Lies</a> failed to ignite the box office last weekend, proving that audiences don't want to be reminded about the war on terror when they go out to the multiplex. Heading into their second weekend, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/leonardodicaprio\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/russellcrowe\">Russell Crowe</a> are expected to add a further $7m to raise the running total to about $24m.</p> <p>Fox Searchlight opens <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126616/secret.life.of.bees\">The Secret Life of Bees</a> and you'd be hard pressed to find a more formidable all-female cast than Queen Latifah, Dakota Fanning, Sophie Okonedo and Alicia Keys. The 1960s southern drama won't go out as wide as Max Payne or W and is expected to gross about $7m. The pundits believe Paramount-DreamWorks' <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126065/eagle.eye\">Eagle Eye</a> starring the Boy Wonder Shia LaBeouf will end up in the same area. The paranoia <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/thriller\">thriller</a> continues to march towards $100m and should end its fourth weekend on about $80m. Sony's Quarantine, a remake of the excellent Spanish horror movie <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/123652/rec\">[Rec]</a>, will slope off in the second weekend as horror films usually do and might gross about $6m for a $20m tally.</p> <p>The fledgling distributor Summit Entertainment is waiting for its first hit and won't get it with the teen comedy Sex Drive, which will be out-muscled by the other top 10 films and will be lucky if it grosses more than $5m. Summit won't have to wait too long, though. It will release the Stephenie Meyer vampire adaptation Twilight starring the UK's Robert Pattinson (Cedric Diggory in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/109039/harry.potter.and.the.goblet.of.fire\">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a>) and Kristen Stewart on November 17. The movie is tracking off the charts and if it opens as well as everyone thinks it will, Summit will own one of the most coveted franchises in Hollywood.</p>",
  "<p>Running east out of Flagstaff, Arizona, along old Route 66 (now Interstate 40), the high desert stretches away to the horizon, punctuated only by a mesa here and there, maybe a house sitting in the middle of what looks like nothing. </p> <p>To the north lies the Navajo reservation, the largest parcel of Native American owned land in the country, where Obama has opened campaign offices, paid a visit, and won the endorsement of the tribe, along with many others. Further off to the north into the Escalante Plateau of southern Utah, setting of Edward Abbey's Desert Solitaire. There, along the Colorado River, dwell \"river rats,\" modern-day prospectors, Vietnam vets running raft trips - rebels, loners, and outsiders.</p> <p>South of the highway, cutting like a bright ribbon across the desert, are what used to be the tracks of the old Santa Fe railroad. Here is another kind of symbol, of the \"conquest\" of the West, the \"manifest destiny\" of the white European settlers who headed out on the railroads loaded with machinery, and sent silver, coal, and minerals back east. </p> <p>We pass through towns with names like Two Guns and Jack Rabbit, then on to Holbrook. There, the proprietor of Joe and Aggie's Mexican-style restaurant tells us that the town made its mark in the history books as where the U.S. government brought Geronimo - the great Apache leader who battled for two decades to protect his tribe's land - when he was finally subdued and captured. </p> <p>As we continue on, the editors in our RV caravan are working madly to finish a video about Fred, a guard at the Hoover Dam, who after inspecting our vehicles for terrorist bombs, ripped off his badge, jumped before the cameras and began a non stop rant against politicians. You'll be seeing that video soon, along with Stan, the Holbrook barber, pulling himself up tall and square and telling the Truth Booth camera that all he wants is for Americans to work together to get out of this financial mess.</p> <p>This part of Arizona is - or ought to be - solidly John McCain country. The Arizona senator is expected to carry his own state. But even here, the Obama forces are at work, a relentless stream of youthful organizers, going town to town, door to door. Already Obama has got what appears to be a secure lead in New Mexico, where more seats in the state's small Congressional delegation - perhaps even all of them - may end up in Democratic hands. We'll be tracking how the race is breaking down in multi-cultural, energy rich New Mexico, where early voting has just gotten underway.</p>",
  "<p>John Lewis, the employee-owned chain seen as a barometer of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/retail\">retail</a> sector, has reported another drop in weekly sales as the financial crisis hits consumer confidence.</p> <p>Total sales across its department stores and Waitrose supermarkets tumbled by 2.2% in the week to October 11, reflecting the current volatility in the economy. Sales in its 27 department sales fell 8%.</p> <p>The British retailer blamed good weather and consumers' response to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">the global financial crisis</a> for the shortfall.</p> <p>\"Last week started with great promise, with sales rising 7% on Sunday and 9% on Monday, but as the financial news worsened and the sun started to shine, so did our trade fall away,\" John Lewis said.</p> <p>The bleak economic outlook and the financial turmoil have collectively battered high street sales and retail confidence.</p> <p>Earlier this week, the British Retail Consortium's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/14/retail-highstreetretailers\">latest snapshot</a> of the retail sector showed that large price cuts and promotions failed to stem the slump in sales as consumers continued to rein in their spending.</p> <p>However, John Lewis had enjoyed a brief and much-needed boost to trade in the previous week, to October 2, when shoppers raced to snap up warmer clothing. The launch of the retailer's Christmas collection also supported the group's total sales which rose by 0.9%.

  "<p>Today, we leave John McCain's home turf. As it turned out, Sedona wasn't exactly McCain country. Far from the bastions of south-west conservatism like Phoenix, this town of 11,000 has become a prime New Age destination because of the \"vortexes\" - special areas of \"enhanced energy flow\" - that supposedly lie amidst the surrounding spectacular landscape of red rock formations. Spas, galleries, and crystal stores outnumber saloons and gun shops - and from all appearances, Obama voters outnumber those loyal to their not-quite-native son.</p> <p>Out in the countryside where McCain has one of his many homes, things were a little more rustic. But even there, the main business are wineries and RV parks, epitomizing the schizophrenic nature of a area whose white population seems evenly divided between working-class Old West and New Age.<br> It also turns out, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/16/uselections20081\">I wrote yesterday</a>, that McCain's \"ranch\" is really more of a \"vacation home,\" just like George W. Bush's Crawford spread. Earlier this month, in a cover story called \"Make-Believe Maverick,\" Rolling Stone's Tom Dickerson pointed out other similarities in the <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/make_believe_maverick_the_real_john_mccain\">mythos that surrounds W. and McCain.</a> \"Both were born into positions of privilege against which they rebelled into mediocrity ... At each step, with the aid of their fathers' powerful friends, both failed upward. And both shed their skins as Episcopalian members of the Washington elite to build political careers as self-styled, ranch-inhabiting Westerners who pray to Jesus in their wives' evangelical churches.\"</p> <p>My favorite take on McCain as maverick (not) comes from <a href=\"http://prorev.com/2008/10/swampoodle-reort-mccain-mugwump-not.html\">my old friend Sam Smith, who writes</a>: \"Mavericks have been best described as cattle that drink upstream from the herd. No one's pissin' in their water.\" He tells the story of the real-life Texas rancher and politician Samuel Augustus Maverick, whose present-day descendants object to McCain's co-option of the term. In any case, Smith concludes, it's looking more and more like \"America will be sending this fake maverick to the feed lot.\"</p>",
  "<p>So, after eight years of Blair and Brown toadying up to Bush, 65% of Brits want Barack Obama to win the presidential election, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/17/uselections2008-barackobama1\">according to the Guardian's international poll</a> published today, and only 15% are rooting for the McCain/Palin ticket \u2013 and one suspects that some of those would be voting for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/dec/22/politics.thefarright\">racist BNP</a> given half a chance, not least when the numbers indicate that Obama is only supported by the 54% of the lowest socio-economic class, whose neglect by New Labour has left many of them clutching at racist straws.</p> <p>In every country, opinions of the US have declined to record levels over George Bush's two terms as president. One can understand why 75% of the French would think so, but what do you make of the Swiss, 86% of whom think so, even though not even the Republicans boycotted Helvetian cheese or cuckoo clocks?</p> <p>The world is showing what it thinks of Sarah Palin and the Bushite know-nothings who have usurped McCain's campaign. So should Americans care? Of course, they <strong>should</strong>, but more pertinent is whether it could be a factor in the election. At this stage, it could well be important.</p> <p>Except in times of war, when American foreign policy happens to the citizenry rather than to others, it is often assumed that presidential politics is all local. In fact, the president, as head of state, symbolises their country, and it is important for Americans how he (or, heaven help us at this present juncture, she) represents them.</p> <p>While it would be easy to dismiss French gall as a natural, well Gallic, prejudice against the Anglo-Saxons, the opinions of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/17/uselections2008\">close allies like Britain</a>, Canada and the rest are certainly worth broadcasting, subtly, by the Obama campaign. After all, even John McCain has invoked the world's low regard for the US as an important issue.</p> <p>An earlier poll this August <a href=\"http://www.undispatch.com/archives/2008/08/new_poll_americ_1.php\"> showed that 78% of American voters</a> also believe the United States is less respected by other countries than it has been in the past and that 80% of voters believe that working with major allies, and through international organizations, is a wiser strategy for achieving the US's international affairs goals.</p> <p>The high international regard for Barack Obama is only a surprise for six-packing evangelist <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=g7TgDanmWkg\">hockey moms like Sarah Palin</a>. She keeps referring to the \"City on a Hill\" as her vision of America \u2013 a phrase she attributes to the Prophet Reagan. And her version is indeed Reaganesque: one of the reasons people used to build cities on hills was because their sewage would fall on the people downhill. The rich usually lived at the top and the poor at the bottom.</p> <p>But of course the original was from a more distinguished prophet in his Sermon on the Mount, and its American form came through the <a href=\" http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/winthrop.htm \">Puritan divine John Winthrop</a>. Now one may, with justice, consider the Pilgrims to be a dangerously bigoted cult, but they had \"a decent respect for the opinions of mankind proper regard for the opinions of mankind.\"</p> <p>Winthrop went on to say (somewhat optimistically, with the self-importance of a cult leader) that \"the eies of all people are upon us; soe that if wee shall deale falsely with our god in this worke wee have undertaken and soe cause him to withdrawe his present help from us, wee shall be made a story and a byword through the world.\"</p> <p>So, far from being a declaration of isolation and disregard for where the city's sewage flowed, Winthrop had a deep regard for the opinions of the rest of the world. The attitude of the freedom-frying Republicans flies not only in the face of their forgotten and erased history, but, happily, runs against the American voters, who <strong>do</strong> care what other people think about them and their leaders.</p> <p>And for its part, the rest of the world will little note nor long remember what the candidates said in the debates, here. But it will never forget what the electorate does on November 4.</p>",
  "<p>In a case that has now gone to the Supreme Court for review, Republicans in Ohio are challenging the registrations of all new voters whose names and other information do not exactly match those in government databases. It turns out that one of the present Ohio voters who could have fallen into this category is Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher - or is it Worzelbacher? - otherwise known as Joe the Plumber.</p> <p>The man John McCain lionised in Wednesday night's debate has since had every aspect of his life scrutinized by the media. They've <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/archives/2008/10/10357_joe-the-plumber.htm\">uncovered some contradictory facts</a>, to say the least: He's not really a plumber, he probably wouldn't pay more taxes under Obama if he bought his business, and he hasn't actually paid some of the taxes he already owes. He's also registered under a different name.</p> <p>The New York Times politics blog today <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/joe-in-the-spotlight/?hp\">included the following piece of information</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>Mr. Wurzelbacher is registered to vote in Lucas County under the name Samuel Joseph Worzelbacher. </p> <p>\"We have his named spelled W-O, instead of W-U,\" Linda Howe, executive director of the Lucas County Board of Elections, said in a telephone interview. \"Handwriting is sometimes hard to read. He has never corrected it in his registration card.\"</p> <p>The records, she said, showed he voted Republican in the March primary. </p> </blockquote> <p>Because Joe the Plumber registered and has a record of voting in the past, he would not be among those targeted by the Republicans. That privilege is reserved for the voters with newly filed registration applications--a group that clearly favors Obama. </p> <p>On Tuesday, a federal court <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/us/16vote.html\">ruled in favor of the GOP,</a> ordering Ohio's Democratic Secretary of State, Jennifer Bruner, to release a list of those voters whose information on voter registration applications does not match the information on Social Security and drivers license databases. Republicans want to force these voters to cast provisional ballots, which can later be scrutinized and challenged; some may instead choose to simply go home.<br> The list includes a stunning <a href=\"http://news.bostonherald.com/news/politics/2008/view/2008_10_16_Ohio_elections_chief_appeals_court_s_voter_ruling/srvc=home&amp;position=recent\">200,000 of the 660,000 Ohioans</a> who have registered since January 1 of this year. The magnitude of the number\u2014like the glitch in Joe the Plumber's registration\u2014prove the fallibility of a system in which sloppy handwriting is being used to deny people their most basic democratic rights.</p>"
