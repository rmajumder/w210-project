  "<p>When it comes to celebrity endorsements in the US presidential race, there are very few surprises. The Cameron Conservative makeover hasn't really crossed the oceans yet and so the dichotomy in Hollywood is still: left wing = everyone cool and famous and pretty and rich; right wing = Jon Voight, guns aloft.</p> <p>But sometimes, a show of solidarity comes out of leftfield that makes you re-evaluate the way we take celebrities for granted. To mark (not celebrate - this column remains defiantly non-partisan, despite being smuggled inside the Liberal Media Elite. We're bringing down from within) Obama's increasingly likely success, this week we look at the celebrities who made this possible. Oprah Schmoprah - this is all about the real powers behind the throne.</p> <p>We haven't spoken about Roseanne Barr's blog, <a href=\"http://www.roseanneworld.com\">roseanneworld.com</a>, on this page before because it would involve looking at it and, frankly, that Botoxed expression of perma surprise that greets one on the opener exacerbates the night traumas. But in the name of journalism I suffer. </p> <p>Now, you might think that a woman who headlined a blog last June with the piercing insight \"Obama's a douchebag\" could not be relied upon for support. But showing the fluidity of opinion that has made Barr such a fount of self-knowledge throughout her career, by August that tune changed. \"Obama seemed manly\", announced the exciting heading: \"Once I saw mr obama wearin' a cowboy hat, I went shit-howdy mad for tha' brotha'!\" </p> <p>It's the ghetto speak that adds a special kind of credence, don't you think? The new Maureen Dowd concludes her musings with the advice, \"He needs to listen to me though and do that hillary thing.\" And what would that be, Rosie? Lose? Ahh, it's maverick advice like that that keeps Karl Rove on his toes.</p> <p>But don't underestimate the importance of lust here. This brings us to our next illustrious supporter. Come on down, pink pantsuit freshly tumble-dried, the glorious Betty White! You know - the one who played Rose on Golden Girls which, for those unfortunate enough to have been born after 1988 was the obvious (if slightly more elderly) template for Sex and the City: there was the dumb one (Rose/Charlotte), the overly sexed one (Blanche/Samantha), the bossy-yet-wise one (Sophia/Miranda) and the one that some claimed looked like a man (Dorothy/Carrie). </p> <p>Betty turned up on the talkshow circuit this week for some reason and threw her fabulous tuppence into the pot. \"That is one hot piece of man!\" cried Betty, a bouncy vision of pastel pink. \"If Barack Obama needs more experience, I could give it to him.\" If you thought the episode of Golden Girls in which the ladies buy condoms for their upcoming cruise could not be bettered, watch Betty's solemn expression as she informs the nation that Sarah Palin \"is one crazy bitch\". Oh Betty, thank you for being a friend.</p> <p>But the number one supporter is Levi Johnston, aka Bristol Palin's babydaddy, who managed to break free from his chains long enough to give a few quotes this week before the muzzle was clamped back on. Aside from voicing his feelings about the Republican convention (\"I was like, 'whatever'\") and his decision to have his wedding ring tattooed instead of the more traditional jewellery method, he propounded his view on Obama. </p> <p>Showing his suitability to be part of the Palin dynasty, he prefaced his opinion with an admission of ignorance before barrelling on in there: \"I don't know anything about him. He seems like a good guy. I like him.\" And then, as certain shadows may have appeared behind him, he swiftly added that he hopes Palin (McCain notably absent from the endorsement) wins. But why, Levi, why? \"She's my future mother-in-law.\" Now go make a rap outta that one, will.i.am.</p>",
  "<p>You never know at my age (69 in January) how people are going to treat you. Quite often now, people offer me their seat on crowded tube trains, but these are usually people almost as old as I am, perhaps trying to convince themselves of their own youthfulness, or youngsters from ethnic minorities who possibly haven't been in this country long enough - or have been brought up too well - to have absorbed the prevailing culture of selfish indifference. The last young person to offer me a seat was a teenage Muslim girl in a headscarf.</p> <p>I always reject such offers, just as I always answer no when I am asked in the supermarket if I would like help in filling my carrier bags, for I don't like to be thought of as old. I wonder when I will start to welcome this sort of attention. That moment, if it comes, will probably be when I find it too exhausting to stand, or when people start to call me \"dear\" or \"sweetie\". For there is evidence that such belittling talk saps the morale of the elderly and makes them feeble and submissive.</p> <p>According to research published in America, \"elderspeak\", as the practice of addressing old people as babies is known, \"begins a negative downward spiral for older persons, who react with decreased self-esteem, depression, withdrawal and the assumption of dependent behaviours\". One survey carried out in a small town in Ohio found that people over 50 who managed to retain a positive attitude to ageing lived on average seven and a half years longer than others, more than if they didn't smoke or took lots of exercise. In a nursing home for people with moderate dementia, it was noted that patients tended to scream and become aggressive if staff used phrases such as \"good girl\", or asked them sweetly how they were feeling.</p> <p>The British government is launching a major review of legislation to protect the elderly from abuse, but naturally this won't cover undermining them with baby talk. This is something the elderly must try to combat on their own. One method, recommended by a 68-year-old woman in California, a police psychologist, is to sprinkle one's conversation with profanities. \"That makes people think, 'This is someone to be reckoned with,'\" she claims. </p> <p><strong>The wretched Bush presidency is</strong> <strong>appropriately</strong> ending its days with a flurry of fresh controversy about the death penalty, a punishment for which Bush has always shown a creepy degree of enthusiasm. Two new cases illustrate again how ghoulish and judicially flawed death sentences in America can be.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Richard Cooey, 41, who had spent more than 20 years on death row, was executed in Ohio after the supreme court rejected his plea that he was too obese (at more than 19 stone) to be painlessly put to death by lethal injection. The court accepted the assurance of prison staff that his arms had accessible veins to which poisons could be administered without subjecting him to \"cruel and unusual punishment\". On Wednesday, the same court, in effect, gave the go-ahead for another execution when it refused to hear an appeal by Troy Davis, a 40-year-old Georgia man, after seven of nine witnesses who helped to convict him in 1991 of killing a police officer had subsequently recanted their testimony or changed their statements. </p> <p>The Pope, Jimmy Carter, Amnesty International and the Council of Europe were among those who had begged that he be spared, but it now seems certain that Davis will die. America's dogged attachment to the death penalty in even the most dubious of circumstances is a hideous blot on its reputation for fairness and humanity that, alas, even Barack Obama has no plans to eradicate. </p> <p><strong>By forcefully dissociating himself from Bush in his final </strong>debate with Obama, John McCain once again laid claim to being a maverick, a term his running mate Sarah Palin also claims for herself whenever she gets the chance. But what exactly is a maverick? I first heard the word when I was four years old on a 78rpm record of the opening number of the then new Broadway musical Oklahoma!, Oh What a Beautiful Morning. It comes in the second verse:</p> <p>All the cattle are standin' like statues,</p> <p>All the cattle are standin' like statues,</p> <p>They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by,</p> <p>But a little brown mav'rick is winkin' her eye.</p> <p>Only years later did I learn that a maverick is a term applied by Texas cowboys to any unbranded calf found wandering about in the wild. It comes from Samuel A Maverick, a 19th-century Texan politician and rancher, who upset his neighbours by refusing to brand his cattle on the grounds that it was cruel. Later the word came to mean a person who could not be trusted to be loyal to his group, though I'm not sure whether this referred to Maverick or his calves. In any case, as applied to people rather than cows, maverick started off as a term of disparagement before becoming what McCain and Palin regard as a badge of honour, signifying a gutsy free spirit. </p> <p>I continue to be puzzled, however, by the fact that the maverick in Oklahoma! is \"winking her eye\", for I have never seen a cow wink and am not even persuaded that it can. But there is one kind of maverick that never stops winking, and that is Palin. She also spouts \"gobbledygook\", which, interestingly, is a term that was coined by Maverick's grandson, Texas congressman Maury Maverick, who died in 1954. </p> <p><strong>This week </strong>Alexander loved the Osbert Lancaster exhibition at the Wallace Collection: \"How often do you find visitors tittering at an art show?\" He also saw the film How to Lose Friends &amp; Alienate People: \"Not much of a plot, but a decent parody of the celebrity magazine culture and a delightful portrayal of Graydon Carter by Jeff Bridges.\"</p>",
  "<p>Too much media coverage of the American election for you? It wasn't always this way. Sometimes the complaints went in the opposite direction. Doing some homework for a speech to an Alistair Cooke centenary event this week, I came across a letter from the then editor of the Guardian Alastair Hetherington to the newspaper's Washington correspondent Max Freedman.</p> <p>The letter was written from Manchester on November 7 1960. Note the date. It was the eve of election day in the John Kennedy-Richard Nixon presidential contest - in the view of many good judges the most interesting, innovative and exciting White House race until the current one. By any reasonable standards, the letter was written at a climactic moment in a resonant political contest.</p> <p>\"I was delighted to see the cable from you last night after the long silence,\" Hetherington wrote to Freedman that day. Then he continued: \"I hope I'm not being unreasonable when I say that a silence of three weeks by one of our two staff correspondents [Cooke was the other] in the United States at the height of a presidential election - and without any explanation - is a bit troubling.\"</p> <p>A bit troubling, eh? I never knew Hetherington well enough to know if he was the grandmaster of ironic understatement that this implies or merely old school courteous under even the most severe of provocations. Either way, the past is indeed another country. They did journalism differently there. Today, a correspondent who went awol for three days in mid-campaign - let alone three weeks - would be dicing with dismissal. Fortunately for the readers, the Guardian still had Cooke on the books. He was in fertile and colourful form throughout the campaign, not least when he reported from New York on September 27 on one of the great innovations of the 1960 campaign, the first-ever televised debate between the two contenders - \"two bloodhounds done up in party frocks\" as Cooke put it. </p> <p>Four decades later, Cooke observed in a Letter From America for the BBC that everyone who saw that first debate in 1960 remembered one thing about it above all - the contrasting physical appearance of the candidates: Kennedy a tanned and bright-eyed prodigy, Nixon pasty-faced, haggard and apparently unshaven. At the time, though, his Guardian report highlighted something less visually memorable but in many ways more prescient for later elections: \"The most an objective reporter can do,\" Cooke wrote, \"is to say that he saw it, in the company of other more or less attentive people, and that nothing happening on the screen converted the personal preference of any one of them.\"</p> <p>Those remarks have stood the test of time well. Voters mostly see what they want to see in the debates. Yet as Barack Obama and John McCain left their party conventions at the start of September and set off at last on the business end of the 2008 campaign trail it became common to say - and I said it myself - that the presidential debates would hold the key to the outcome. </p> <p>After watching all three of them, as well as the Biden-Palin debate, it is clear that this was just a journalistic cliche. We were wrong. The debates didn't hold the key. They merely confirmed people in the views they had already formed, much as Cooke said in 1960.</p> <p>All the 2008 debates have been circumspect and highly professional affairs. They have not been dull, although the second debate came close and the formats ought to be looked at afresh. But journalists have been wrong to frame the televised debates as sporting contests. It means we spend our time looking for the wrong things.</p> <p>There was a classic example of this in the first debate. Most political writers thought the first half-hour of the on-off-on debate in Jackson on September 26, when the candidates talked about the swirling financial crisis, was about as energising as a bedtime mug of cocoa. This overlooked a real difference in approach between the two candidates. While Obama talked about ordinary families, their housing costs, jobs, pensions and savings, McCain did his usual riff about the vices of the Washington special interests and their influence over federal programmes - a subject that was, at best, marginal to the problem and to how it was perceived in middle America. My view that night was that Obama had the presidency pretty much in the bag in that first 30 minutes.</p> <p>Yet after each contest, after the candidates had debated in the small hours in America, we in Britain have woken up and switched on the radio to learn that no one landed a knockout blow - another cliche that misses the point. Too many observers wait for someone to say something either utterly brilliant or staggeringly stupid. But that's not what the debates are about. The real point of the debates is that they are opportunities to test the presidential timber of the candidate the viewers are probably going to vote for anyway. Obama grasps this, even if not many others seem to.</p> <p>The other strikingly shaming thing about all three debates is that much of the press seem to have misread each one of them. The default press view of the first debate was that McCain was the winner; the viewers, however, gave it to Obama by 51%-38%. Two weeks on, the press called the second debate as a tie; meanwhile the viewers said Obama took it by an even greater margin, 54%-30%. </p> <p>This week the same thing happened a third time. McCain was said to have come out swinging and to be landing blows - don't we just love those manly boxing metaphors? - and was again adjudged by the media to have had the better of the exchanges. The viewers, meanwhile, quietly awarded the debate to Obama by 58%-31%. The percentage of viewers with a favourable view of Obama went from 63% at the start of Wednesday's debate to 66% at the end; those with a favourable view of McCain went from 51% to 49%. </p> <p>I don't say that Obama can't now lose this race, or that it may not get tighter as November 4 nears - though there is no sign of either yet. Nor that half a century of televised debates has been a better way of testing and judging the candidates than the weekly contests in the House of Commons. But I do say that Americans have looked long and hard at the candidates this past month and are now minded to conclude, in the fine phrase used by Garrison Keillor of a speech he heard the young Kennedy give long ago, that Obama just has more keys on his piano than the other guy. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Looking for voters on a warm evening this week, Megan Tirpak and Jenn Gooding went door to door in a middle class neighbourhood of Morrisville, North Carolina. They found a cricket match - half a dozen children of South Asian descent who had set up a wicket in a driveway and were bowling a tennis ball.</p> <p>\"We're volunteers with the Obama campaign and we have early-voting information for you,\" Tirpak, a 25-year old college student, told a man standing nearby. The scene helps to illustrate why Barack Obama could be the first Democrat to carry the state since Jimmy Carter in 1976.</p> <p>In recent years North Carolina has seen an influx of educated workers to its burgeoning hi-tech and pharmaceutical sectors who are turned off by the Republicans' social conservatism. More than half the voters that Tirpak and Gooding encountered in Morrisville were immigrants. North Carolina is also one-fifth African American. </p> <p>Those factors, plus the efforts of thousands of volunteers like Tirpak and Gooding, have allowed Obama to pull level with, or even ahead of McCain in North Carolina polls. In a sign of Republican trepidation, McCain campaigned here on Monday.</p> <p>The cricketers are too young to vote, but the man watching them assured Tirpak and Gooding of his backing for Obama and gladly accepted the proffered campaign literature. \"Ah, I can vote at my son's school,\" he said. </p> <p>Tirpak has spent every evening this month going door to door to persuade a computer-generated list of likely Obama voters to get to the polls.</p> <p>\"The Obama campaign is everywhere,\" said Andrew Taylor, a political scientist at North Carolina State University. \"They have volunteers, they are calling everybody, including registered Republicans, and you don't hear anything on the McCain side.\"</p> <p>The discrepancy between Obama and McCain's field strength is plain: until last week Obama had 45 field offices across the state, compared with fewer than 20 for McCain. McCain has since opened more, but most only operate part time.</p> <p>Obama's massive volunteer corps in North Carolina and elsewhere seems to vindicate Democrats who in the spring said that the bitter and protracted primary battle with Hillary Clinton would ultimately benefit, not damage, the nominee.</p> <p>Ahead of North Carolina's May primary election, Obama staff and volunteers worked feverishly to register new voters and compile supporter lists. When Obama staffers returned in force over the summer, they reconnected with existing networks of volunteers who had spent the summer at fairs, baseball games and other events to register voters, gather names of likely supporters and spread the word about Obama. Figures from the state board of elections show the Democrats have made huge gains in the past year. Now 2.8 million Democrats are registered, compared with 2 million Republicans, with an additional 1.4 million independents.</p> <p>Unlike typical field operations, the Obama effort this year is notable for the level of autonomy afforded to groups of volunteers and for the close coordination between volunteer groups and paid field staff. Most political campaigns treat volunteers merely as labourers, assigning them rote tasks under staff management, while the Obama campaign divides entire neighbourhoods among different volunteer organisations. The volunteers also recruit more volunteers.</p> <p>Faulkner Fox, a writer and yoga instructor, helped to found the campaign group Durham for Obama in the winter. Now she and her husband, a Duke University professor, manage more than 100 volunteers who go door to door at weekends. Fox, a mother of three, spends 40 hours a week on campaign efforts, without pay. She has amassed detailed knowledge of the abilities of her workers and the environment on the ground, including \"which Wal-Marts would let us work in front of them, and which would not\".</p> <p>Before running for office Obama was a community organiser in Chicago and led a voter registration drive there. Fox attributes the intensity of the Obama campaign's field operation in part to that experience. She mocks the Republicans' apparent rejection of community organising as a political tool, evident in speeches at their September national convention.</p> <p>\"The Republican party was like, 'what is a community organiser?',\" Fox said. \"Well, on election day, you're going to find out.\"</p>",

Although he warned his supporters at a fundraising breakfast in New York against becoming too cocky, the Democratic candidate is pursuing a strategy that could see him take states that George Bush won with ease in 2000 and 2004. </p> <p>Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, said after the debate in Hempstead that Obama and his running mate, Joe Biden, were now considering visits to states such as Montana and North Dakota, once considered beyond reach. \"I think it is fair to say that we are thinking of going into states we were not sure of at all earlier,\" said Axelrod. \"Some things are opening up for us here that no one fully anticipated.\"</p> <p>Other states coming into play include West Virginia, Kentucky and Georgia. Obama's campaign team said yesterday it would begin to broadcast new ads in these states. Even if they prove to be beyond Obama's reach, his campaigning will force the cash-strapped Republicans to spend money and effort defending states they once took for granted. </p> <p>Obama, speaking before heading to a rally in New Hampshire, warned his supporters against being carried away by his poll leads and the huge amounts of cash coming in. \"For those of you who are feeling giddy or cocky, or think this is all set, I just have two words for you: New Hampshire,\" he said. \"I've been in these positions before when we were favoured and the press starts getting carried away, and we end up getting spanked.\" He lost the New Hampshire primary to Hillary Clinton in January, a shock result after opinion polls had credited him with big leads. </p> <p>A similar warning was delivered on Wednesday by a Democratic congressman, Jack Murtha, who told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that western Pennsylvania was a \"racist area\", and that could cost Obama about 4% of the vote in a state he has to hold.</p> <p>The prospect of Obama and Biden going to North Dakota shows how much ground he has made since the summer, when he pulled campaign staff out of the state, calculating there was little prospect of taking it. Between them, Montana and North Dakota account for only six of the 270 electoral college votes Obama and McCain need to win the White House - a fraction compared with a battleground such as Ohio, with 20 electoral college votes.</p> <p>But the push will not go unchallenged, said a McCain adviser, Charlie Black. He said McCain was expecting a new infusion of revenue to buy up ads in the remaining days. \"I think maybe the advertising discrepancy will be getting a little better this week,\" he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338695221\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/16/press-centre-460x276.jpg\" alt=\"Press centre\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reporters (right) watch the third and final presidential debate in the press centre at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.

In the CBS survey 53% of uncommitted voters believed he won, compared with 22% for McCain. Some 24% said the debate was a draw. CNN gave the debate to Obama by 58% to 31%. </p> <p>The debate, like much of the past four weeks, was overwhelmed by public fears about economic recession. McCain sought to find common cause with voters, most notably by his frequent references to \"Joe the Plumber\" - Ohio voter Joe Wurzelbacher.</p> <p>McCain also made his most significant break to date with Bush's White House - a move his rival Democratic strategists said should have come far earlier to be effective.</p> <p>\"I am not President Bush. If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago. I want a new direction for this country,\" he said.</p> <p>Obama shot back that McCain had been a loyal Bush supporter. His camp also moved yesterday to neutralise the Republican's efforts by releasing a new ad with footage of McCain saying he had voted with Bush more than 90% of the time.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338700429\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>It came so close to being remembered as the hockey mom election. But, doggone it, hockey moms will just have to wait another four years. The 2008 US presidential election belongs to just one man: Joe the Plumber. On Saturday Joe Wurzelbacher was, well, an ordinary Joe. Or to use a Sarah Palinism, a Joe Six Pack. Yesterday he woke to find himself transformed into an international phenomenon.</p> <p>By mentioning him more than 13 times in the first 10 minutes of Wednesday night's third and final presidential debate, the Republican candidate, John McCain, sent Wurzelbacher into a media stratosphere the likes of which most publicity-starved brands can only dream of. Groups sprang up on Facebook with names like Joe the Plumber for President and Fans of Joe the Plumber.</p> <p>He rose to number seven on Google's list of most popular search expressions. T-shirts were rush-printed overnight, showing his bald, burly head above the logo: \"Hi, I'm Joe Plumber and Obama is a punk.\"</p> <p>Joe Francis, a plumber who mends pipes in Amarillo, Texas, 1,000 miles from Wurzelbacher's home, received more than 600 phone calls from people expressing interest in his website, Joetheplumber.com. One man offered him $350,000 (\u00a3200,000) to buy the domain name. \"He sounded pretty serious,\" an employee told the Guardian.</p> <p>The maelstrom began only a few minutes into the televised debate at Hofstra University, on Long Island, on Wednesday night, when McCain seized on an impromptu encounter between Obama and a resident in Holland, Ohio, last weekend. \"His name is Joe Wurzelburger,\" McCain said, getting his Wurzelbachers in a twist.</p> <p>Joe was a man who was trying to realise the American dream, McCain went on, working 10, 12 hours a day to build up his business. He was planning to buy up another small business, but realised that under Obama's tax plans he would be penalised for earning more than $250,000 a year.</p> <p>\"Joe, I want to tell ya,\" McCain said, staring straight to camera and slipping into the good ol' cowboy dialect that American politicians adopt when they talk directly to voters, even though they are multimillionaires from elite naval backgrounds. \"I'll keep your taxes low.\"</p> <p>Later in the debate, McCain accused Obama through his tax proposals of waging \"class warfare\". Which was clever, because it distracted from the fact that in evoking the archetype of Joe the Plumber, McCain was himself declaring class warfare against Obama.</p> <p>It is the way with such things that this whole escapade only came about by luck. Obama, taking a swing through the hugely significant swing state of Ohio at the weekend, just happened to stroll down Shrewsbury Street, in Holland, when Wurzelbacher was outside his house.</p> <p>\"Your new tax plan is going to tax me more, isn't it?\" he asked the senator for Illinois.</p> <p>Obama told him: \"It's not that I want to punish your success. I think if you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody.\"</p> <p>This is the YouTube election, so naturally the exchange was video recorded and was up for anyone to see within a matter of hours. Rightwing bloggers started linking to it, and from there it was just a small step on to Rush Limbaugh's radio show and Rupert Murdoch's Fox News channel - presenting the ailing McCain campaign with a gift for the final debate.</p> <p>The trajectory of the story is clear. But as one blogger put it, \"Who the devil is Joe the Plumber?\"</p> <p>Wurzelbacher, 34, describes himself as having 15 years' experience in the trade. He was, he says, raised by a poor single mother. \"I don't have any bells and whistles. My trucks are a couple of years old and I'm going to have them for the next 10 years, probably,\" he told the Toledo Base newspaper. But that leaves unexplained questions.</p> <p>The plumbers' union covering his area, Local 50, pointed out that he was not a member and had no licence to operate. \"We checked with his neighbours and they say they have never seen a service truck in his driveway,\" said the union's business manager, Thomas Joseph.</p> <p>Wurzelbacher said the lack of paperwork had a simple explanation: he works for a small plumbing company on residential properties, so has no need for a licence of his own. Which in turn raises the question, how can a relatively lowly employee of a tiny plumbing company contemplate buying up a concern with the prospect of turning over more than $250,000 a year?</p> <p>This one, it is safe to say, will run and run. In the meantime, Wurzelbacher is enjoying his 15 minutes of fame, telling anyone who will listen - and there are plenty of them - his views on America (\"the greatest country on Earth\"), Obama's policies (\"one more step towards socialism\") and the Iraq war (\"what we've done over there is incredible\").</p> <p>So far, he has not revealed which way he is going to vote. But one thing we do know is that his dislike of handing money to the government is genuine. Last year he had an order placed on him for failure to pay $1,182.92 in back-taxes.</p>",
  "<p>It was John McCain's best performance of the three presidential debates. He kept attacking, kept his opponent on the defensive and kept the initiative, booming at one point: \"I am not President Bush.\" But it was not enough. The more Mr McCain laboured on Wednesday night to paint Barack Obama in lurid colours - he accused him of extremism on abortion and class warfare on taxes - the more he appeared to make his opponent's case for him. The epithets may seem hysterical to European ears, although to large swathes of the US television audience, they are probably less so. But the blanket nature of the charge, the fact that if we are to take Mr McCain's words literally, Mr Obama is rotten to the core (he consorts with washed-out terrorists), speaks also of the accuser's frame of mind. The lack of judgment that Mr McCain has shown at key points in this campaign, and in his choice of running mate, is important. As president, he would be routinely called upon to make judgments about real terrorist threats, so the relish with which he invents imaginary ones is disturbing. </p> <p>Mr McCain came across as aggressive and cantankerous, the neighbour who would yell at kids skateboarding down his drive, the old man who loses his rag too quickly because of his heart condition. Mr Obama became by comparison cooler, younger, fitter and more cerebral - in a word, more presidential. Mr McCain's performance invoked pity, Mr Obama's respect.</p> <p>Mr Obama could have thrown a fair pile of dirt at Mr McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin. Invited explicitly by the moderator of the debate to do so, Mr Obama declined, praising her energy as a campaigner instead. In short, he was not playing that game, even though his television advertising tells a different story. Mr McCain may have warmed the cockles of supporters, like Ms Palin, who urged him to put the knife in and then twist it. But there is a cost to be paid in appearing too keen to finish off your opponent. In the heat of battle, Mr McCain lost sight of the two qualities that helped him defeat his rivals for the nomination, his honourable record as a soldier and his independence as a politician. In trying to give the Republican base the raw meat they craved for, Mr McCain forgot himself, and in so doing turned neutral, uncommitted voters away in droves.</p> <p>Cast the net wider, to the international polling commissioned by the Guardian and seven other leading newspapers in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Poland, Canada, Japan and Mexico, and the judgment for Mr Obama is starker still. He would win by a straight majority in six of the eight countries surveyed. In Britain, Mr Obama is ahead of his Republican rival by 64% to 15%. Of more concern to a future US president is the finding that only a minority in the countries surveyed describe relations with the US as friendly. This confirms the other source of anguish that is at the heart of this election. America has lost international standing among its natural allies such as Britain and France, and its immediate neighbours Mexico and Canada. This is the bequest of a president who launched two wars, could finish neither, and leaves office on the brink of a global recession. But it also has implications for the three remaining weeks of campaigning.</p> <p>It means that Americans are turning against the Republican candidate not just because he has been too closely associated with the failing economic policies of the ancien regime, although that is the primary reason for Mr McCain's slippage in the polls. The revolt is also caused by evidence that America has lost its place in the world and squandered the privileges it enjoyed to set the economic and military world order. This thought should trouble Europe, which has neither the political unity nor the military might to replace the US role on the world stage. Mr Obama will not easily be able to turn this round, if he is elected. But that he should be elected president, few around the world now dispute.</p>",
  "<p>To say that Wednesday night's 2008 presidential debate was our best so far is to say precious little, but it's true nevertheless. According to a survey conducted by <a href=\"http://www.freepress.net/debates\">Free Press</a>, the national, nonpartisan media reform group, and devised by Andrew Tyndall, publisher of Tyndall Report: \"A virtually identical majority of both candidates' supporters picked Schieffer as the best (62% of McCain's; 63% of Obama's) and almost nobody ranked NBC's Brokaw No. 1 (8% and 6%, respectively). Jim Lehrer of PBS was ranked better than Brokaw, worse than Schieffer\". </p> <p>I'm not sure Schieffer's questions were any better than the others, but the questions in a presidential debate don't matter unless they are really stupid \u2014 like when the late <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF9gSyku-fc\">Bernard Shaw asked Mike Dukakis</a> how he would like his wife being brutally raped. Since it's impossible to force a candidate to actually answer a question without appearing overly rude, the best thing a moderator can do is get out of the way and allow the candidates to define themselves in ways that honestly highlight the differences they share and the implications of these differences for their prospective presidencies. </p> <p>That happened repeatedly last night. McCain began the night quite \"aggressively\" as the pundits kept saying over and over. He was also full of gimmicks, referring over and over to the newly-famous <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2008/oct/16/joe-the-plumber\">Joe the Plumber</a>. </p> <p>McCain even spoke to him repeatedly as a surrogate for the rest of America. It's too bad for McCain that Joe does not appear to have been an undecided voter. I have received emails this morning informing me that he is both a <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/joe-in-the-spotlight/?hp\">registered Republican</a> and was a registered to vote with the Natural Law Party. I've seen other, more incriminating allegations that, if true, will make both Joe and John rue the day he was mentioned. I'm sure this will amuse journalists all day long. But ultimately Joe is beside the point and it's an absolute wonder to me why John McCain imagined a gimmick like this guy \u2014 why not <a href=\"http://www.bobthebuilder.com/uk/about_bob.asp\">Bob the Builder</a> or Boris the Banker or Barry the Barista? \u2014 might help him turn this election around. Undecided voters were not looking to see whether McCain would be \"aggressive\" or when and how he would bring up William Ayers. They were trying to figure out what kind of president each man would be and what that presidency would mean for people like themselves.</p> <p>In that regard \u2014 though the pundits did not appear to notice this until the insta-polls came in \u2014 most people don't find the idea of a McCain presidency appealing. Sure, as <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122411909182439021.html\">Karl Rove claims</a>, Obama has yet to \u2013 cue the clich\u00e9 \u2013 \"close the sale\" but most of the customers have already left McCain's showroom. Why, exactly? Nobody knows. Personally I find him mercurial, erratic, personally cloying and dangerously old for this kind of job and incompetent in exactly the areas that a president needs to be expert at the moment. I'm not so crazy about his politics, either. And his running mate is a bad joke \u2014 well actually, she's a good joke, but a bad running mate, and would be an even worse vice-president and an unthinkably bad vice-president. And yes, I happen to like Barack Obama more than any politician in my adult lifetime. So I don't trust my own judgment on these matters. I'm as un-undecided as a person can possibly be.</p> <p>But if you look at the debate from the point of view of those who might have been undecided, and from McCain's perspective of how to reach them, he had only two real choices. He had tried to play by the rules of comity and explain to people why he'd be a more competent steward of their future than Obama in the previous two debates \u2014 as did his running mate Palin in her debate with Joe Biden \u2014 and all he did was increase Obama's lead in swing states to the point where we may be looking at a landslide. McCain could not win this debate on points no matter how impressed Wolf Blitzer was with his \"energy\". His only hope of winning was to \u2014 somehow \u2014 put Obama away. McCain had to make his opponent appear unacceptable to the broad middle and offer himself as the last guy standing. And given what we know about McCain's ambition and willingness to lie, flip-flop, pander and cajole, he would have done it if he could have figured out how. </p> <p>Since he couldn't, his only choice was to try to restore his pre-election reputation and lose with dignity, without the voters but with the media back in his corner. Instead he did a little of everything. He went after Obama with a feather duster. He spoke about his own honour and reputation but pretty much ignored the concerns of voters, unless they happen to be plumbers who wished to buy their own businesses but did not want to pay additional taxes on income or profits above $250,000.</p> <p>Obama, meanwhile, just stood there and said, subliminally, \"I may be black and have a funny name with 'Hussein' in the middle of it and it rhymes with Osama, but I can do this job. This other guy, the old war hero who keeps calling you his 'friends' can't \u2014 at least not in a time of economic meltdown.\"</p> <p>Stick a fork in this election. For anyone who is not a conservative ideologue of some sort, it is really no choice at all. And thanks to Bob Schieffer for allowing both candidates to show us that. </p> <p>The Age of Obama began last night.</p>",
  "<p>I don't understand why <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocall\">robocalls</a> work, and there doesn't seem to be much research to suggest that they do, but they're so widespread that presumably they must. You're eating dinner, the phone rings, and you pick it up only to find you've not simply been interrupted by an unwanted political sales call, but by a sales call on behalf of a party that couldn't even be bothered to have a real human call you. And so, as a result, you... become more likely to vote for that party's candidate? That seems like a dangerous gamble for a politician to make, and since so many of the people you reach will be planning on voting, you've got far more to lose by alienating them than if you're making ordinary, non-political cold calls: most of the people you alienate with those were probably never part of your potential customer base anyhow. Yet robocalls persist, and they're getting unpleasant: <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1008/Harsh_GOP_robocall_hits_Ayers.html\">listen here</a> to one that details the crimes of the Weather Underground in order to attack Obama, and to <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/new_robocalls_from_mccain_and.php\">one here</a> that accuses the Democrats of \"putting Hollywood above America.\" Oh, and <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/mccainrnc_robocall_questions_w.php\">here's one</a> telling those who receive it that \"Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats aren't who you think they are...\"</p> <p>Above all, robocalls are cheap and easy: earlier this year, one firm told Politico it can place <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0208/8742.html\">a million calls in under half an hour</a>. \"Some days, we call 10% to 20% of the US population,\" an executive at the firm said.</p> <p>\"Good day at the office, honey?\"<br>\"You better believe it. I irritated between 10% and 20% of the population of America today.\"<br>\"Oh, honey, I am <em>so proud of you!</em>\"<br>\"I think a little celebration is in order. I was thinking maybe we could -- oh, for God's sake, who's that phoning at this time of the evening?\"<br></p>",
  "<p>If you were looking for an explanation as to why John McCain's campaign is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/15/us/politics/15poll.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;adxnnl=\" 1_e\" f=\"slogin&amp;adxnnlx=&quot;1224043051-odCp6IWacfSxnc7yi+OINg&quot;\" \">floundering so badly</a> you could do worse than come to Roanoke.</p> <p>While the town is in no sense a bellwether, most of the factors that are dogging him nationally are clearly evident here. I refer not to the issues - the economy, the war and so on - but the political, strategic and organisational dynamics that give the impression of a campaign about to implode. The situation in Roanoke, and the surrounding area, exposes five central weaknesses with the McCain campaign thus far.</p> <p><strong>1) His <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/03/uselections2008.sarahpalin1\">own supporters don't like him</a></strong>. Or at least they don't like him enough. This counters the dominant narrative of the primary season that Democrats were bitterly divided while the Republicans quickly rallied around their candidate. I have yet to meet a Democrat here who supported Hillary Clinton who bears a grudge against Barack Obama. That doesn't mean they don't exist. But Obama only won this town narrowly, I've met a lot of Democrats and they all seem to be behind him. On the other hand, the Republicans have no great love for McCain. They respect him - or at least they respect his military service. But most did not vote for him (Huckabee won Virginia and Roanoke) and they talk about him in much the same way that Democrats spoke about Kerry in 2004. He's the candidate they've settled for, not the one they wanted. They do however love Sarah Palin who has galvanised many into action. But at the end of the day huge support for the number two just doesn't have the same impact. <br> <strong>2) He has few effective surrogates.</strong> In the two and a half weeks that I've been here, the Democrats have had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/video/2008/oct/14/bill-clinton\">rallies and meetings with Bill Clinton</a>, Indiana senator <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2008/oct/06/uselections2008.barackobama\">Evan Bayh</a> (standing in for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/deadlineusa/2008/oct/05/uselections2008\">Joe Biden </a>whose mother-in-law was dying) and former Democratic National Committee chairman <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/01/uselections2008.virginia\">Terry McAuliffe</a>. On Friday, Barack Obama is coming. The Republicans have had no one and as of yet plan to have no one. If you cast about for those who might speak for him, you can see why that would be. Obama can count on his wife, Michelle Obama, Biden, Biden's wife Jill and the Clintons to speak for him. McCain could not send out his wife, Cindy, George W Bush or George HW Bush to stump for him. Indeed, for the first few weeks he would barely send Palin out on her own, either because she was not ready or was in preparation for her debate. So while the Obama camp has been covering huge amounts of electoral turf, getting free local television coverage and energising their supporters on the way, the McCain campaign has all too often been travelling in a pack and leaving little opportunity for anyone, including him, to come to a place like Roanoke. <br> <strong>3) Neither he nor Palin has been here. </strong>A look at the election results of 2004 shows that Bush won by racking up huge majorities in small county after small county which in the end more than compensated for his poor showing in the cities. He didn't just win them. He won them big. If McCain is going to win Virginia, he has to take the southwestern region of the state by a sizeable margin. At present, that is not going to happen. Local Democrats say that Obama needs to win 40% in this area to be viable in the rest of the state. A<a href=\"http://www.tricities.com/tri/news/local/article/latest_mason_dixon_poll_shows_s outhwest_virginia_favors_mccain_over_obama/14598/\"> poll taken 10 days ago</a> gave him 39%. Given other trends, it's almost certainly much higher now. A visit, particularly by Palin, would make a huge difference in a region like this. Instead they both went to Virginia Beach (see point 2) and then she headed to Richmond - a city he is never going to win.<br> <strong>4) He is being outspent and has been outorganised.</strong> Last month, Roanoke city, which is Democratic, saw more than three times the increase of registered voters as the county, which is heavily Republican. The Obama campaign has <a href=\"http://obama.3cdn.net/716d686803fcf88101_7gdymv24j.pdf\">48 offices </a> and a further 19 sub-offices in Virginia. The <a href=\"http://virginia.johnmccain.com/content/sitecontentmain.aspx?guid=\" 6e4ed930-3f71-\" 4f83-a7ca-42ea9e218a26\">McCain campaign has 21</a>. Obama has spent more than <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/politics/wb/180256\">twice as much as McCain in television ads in the region</a>. The combined effect of those advantages is that while Obama's message is constantly being relayed on the airwaves and in person while volunteers mobilise the base, the physical and political presence of the McCain campaign is at best patchy.<br> <strong>5) He shouldn't have to either come here or spend money here.</strong> Virginia has not voted Democratic since 1964. The last time before that was 1948. The very fact that McCain should be spending money, organising and campaigning here tells you just how much trouble he is in. In North Carolina, Indiana and most recently Missouri, Obama is encroaching heavily into what should be McCain's safest territory. He is forcing McCain to spend money and time in places that ought to be safe or risk losing them entirely. The last place a Republican presidential candidate needs to be thinking about three weeks before polling day is southwest Virginia. But if McCain doesn't think about it, he can't win the state. And if he doesn't win the state, it's difficult to see how he can win the country.</p>",
  "<p>Your <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/59/3/everybodywil.html\">15 minutes of fame</a> can come in a variety of forms. Perhaps one wins some sort of competitive eating contest, or saves people from a burning building, or wins the lottery. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-johnmccain-barackobama-debate-joe-the-plumber\">Joe Wurzelbacher's 15 minutes</a>, however, were afforded some additional heft as they played out on the broadest of stages - last night's final debate between presidential candidates. All told, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/16/AR2008101600107.html\">his name was mentioned 26 times by Barack Obama and John McCain</a>. Well, technically, I guess only 25 times. McCain accidentally called him Wurzelburger once. But we all knew who he meant, right?</p> <p>Mr Wurzelbacher is now known as Joe the Plumber, and he wasn't famous before October 12, when he found himself in a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with the Democratic presidential nominee. Joe has been in the plumbing industry for years, and is trying to purchase the company that he has served for so long in his hometown of Holland, Ohio. Who better to run the business than someone who has worked his way up through its ranks, right? Right.</p> <p>Only trouble is, Joe the Plumber's entrepreneurial success could now rest in the palm of the American people, as he is a near-perfect example of what the Republicans have been calling a hazard of Obama's proposed tax plan. Joe's business earns between $250,000 and $280,000, and according to Obama's plan (and from his own lips) we now know that every dollar above $250,000 Joe's company earns will be subject to a 39% tax, up from the standard 36%. (The 36% will still apply for all amounts under $250K). Joe says that this additional tax, should it be implemented, would prevent him from purchasing the company. His American dream would be thwarted.</p> <p>Well now, what would <a href=\"http://www.online-literature.com/horatio-alger/\">Horatio Alger</a> say to that? </p> <p>Obama did not deny that Joe's company would be subject to a tax increase on any profit over $250,000. How could he? He did not back down, nor did he try to spin his response in a way that would convolute the truth. Yes - should he become president, he would be asking Joe the Plumber to pay more money in taxes. \"Nobody likes taxes,\" says Obama in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KXRq2bErVc&amp;feature=related\">the video of the conversation</a>. </p> <p>He then asks Joe to consider the fact that because he has worked so hard and attained such success in the plumbing industry, he could now potentially own his own company. He asks Joe to think of the plumbers who are today where he was a decade ago - who are trying to work their way up just as Joe has - and how this plan will make things easier on them. Taxes would be cut for 95% of working Americans. It was a risky move - and I say this without any derision towards Joe or Obama - to ask a voter to his face to accept a difficult change in order to make life easier on a stranger. In fact, it's rather the opposite of the glad-handing <em>modus operandi</em> of most politicians. </p> <p>During the debate last night, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/15/AR2008101503162.html\">McCain addressed Joe directly</a>, promising to use his potential presidency to help him succeed in his small business. McCain indicated that the plight of Joe the Plumber is the plight of the \"Average American Person\" - and I don't deny that Joe has most certainly become the Everyman for a select group of small business owners. However, I don't believe that a vast number of Americans could complain about the additional taxes they'll have to pay once they make it to $250,001 a year. That is not a universal experience. Most small business owners don't come close to earning that much. Fewer than 20% of Americans earn more than $100,000 annually, and the median figure hovers somewhere around $50,000.</p> <p>Obama wants Joe to take a tax hit so that the nation's wealth can be spread, and McCain wants to protect Joe so that he, in turn, can spread the wealth around the nation in the other direction.</p> <p>So how did Joe the Plumber get so much responsibility in this election? </p> <p>It could be the name - he's probably in the same club frequented by such celebrities as Joe Six-pack, Average Joe and Joe Schmoe. Or it could be his story - he's worked hard all his life, and will America let him take that next step up the ladder of success? Or perhaps it's Joe himself. He's articulate, he's Midwestern, he's confident, he never sought out the spotlight but <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KXRq2bErVc&amp;feature=related\">now that he's in it</a>, he's performing quite well. No wonder the Republicans want him to join them at their campaign rallies this weekend. </p> <p>I heard he's busy, though, and can't accept the trip. But if the candidates are giving away vacations, I can offer you a character who could really turn things around for either side. She's representative of a large part of the American population, her small business is non-existent, and she doesn't have a trade that is in danger of earning anywhere near $250,000. </p> <p>I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce Meg the Blogger. Really, get her while you can.</p>",
  "<p>There is nothing uniquely African about corruption \u2013 or war, or arms trafficking, or the power of petroleum to encourage excessively selfish behaviour among men. If any good could come of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/07/france\">Angolagate</a>, it might be this: a lesson for the many millions of westerners who still manage to delude themselves with the idea that Africans are somehow nastier and greedier (or, in the case of mainstream media and pop-star portrayals, simpler and sweeter) than the rest of us.</p> <p>Among those accused in the arms-to-Angola scandal is a long list of French businessmen and senior government officials, many of whom served during the presidency (1981 to 1995) of the late Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand. His own son, 61-year-old Jean-Christophe, is accused of \"complicity in illegal trade and embezzlement\" and of having received over $2.6 million in bribes. Yet I hear no moans and groans in Britain about the corrupt bloody French. Despite its name, Angolagate is more a reflection of French greed and French politics than Angolan corruption, even if several Angolans probably did also walk away with large wads of wonga.</p> <p>In 1993, just months after a first and very flawed election had collapsed the year before, the <a href=\"http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/60187963.html?dids=60187963:60187963&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Feb+13%2C+1993&amp;author=SCOTT+KRAFT&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Renewed+Heavy+Fighting+Dashes+Hopes+in+Angola+Africa%3A+Prospects+for+peace+were+short-lived.+Foreign+governments+are+losing+patience+with+combatants.&amp;pqatl=google\">Angolan war escalated</a> considerably. The central highland cities of Kuito and Huambo were among the worst affected, split down the middle between forces loyal to the ruling Movimento Popular da Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola (MPLA) and the then rebel army, Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola (Unita).</p> <p>Angolan President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Dos Santos was desperate, and feared he would finally be defeated by his oldest and most brilliant enemy, Unita leader Jonas Malheiro Savimbi. So the story goes, he called up an old socialist comrade, <a href=\"http://sg.news.yahoo.com/afp/20081012/twl-angola-france-corruption-weapons-6b0205e.html\">Jean-Bernard Curial</a>, who also happened to be the Africa advisor to Mitterand's Parti Socialiste (PS). The networks swung into action, and soon huge arms deals were under way involving the Angolan, Slovakian and Russian governments. All almost well and good: the only sticking point was the conservative French ministry of defence, which favoured Savimbi's rightwing Unita over the still seemingly socialist MPLA.</p> <p>As Global Witness's <a href=\"http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/671/en/angolagate_trial_opens_global_witness_comment_\">Alex Yearsley</a> puts it:</p> <blockquote> <p>There was a double French policy concerning Angola, a hangover from the Cold War if you like. And those battles \u2013 between right and left, between who gets into the French presidency and who doesn't - have continued. This is how the Angolagate trial should be understood. The French political establishment are having their dirty laundry put on show in the death throes of a trial that was supposed to be about corruption, arms dealing and money laundering.</p> </blockquote> <p>With this in mind, it will be interesting to see how far President Nicolas Sarkozy will go to protect his <a href=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20080523-sarkozy-angola-mend-ties-angola-france\">new-found friendship</a> with Dos Santos. Observers in Paris expect the French investigating judge, Philippe Courroye, to subpoena senior Angolans - including the president - who have been named in the indictment, and accused of financially benefiting from the arms deals. But Sarkozy will not want to upset the Angolan leader, who heads what is one of Africa's largest oil-producing nations pumping out close to 2 million barrels a day.</p> <p>The trial is expected to last five months, which would push proceedings into March next year \u2013 the same year that marks Dos Santos' 30th in power, and the same year in which he has promised to hold presidential elections (the first in 17 years). The last thing he needs is details of backhanders and arms deals splattered across the newspapers. If he is embarrassed publicly, he will ensure that French interests suffer in Angola's oil, energy and construction sectors. Which is why we should be watching Sarkozy closely.</p> <p>Incidentally, earlier this month, Dr Edward George, an economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, <a href=\"http://www.eiuresources.com/mediadir/default.asp?Criteria=FullName&amp;Locator=WORLD&amp;SearchTerm=%20&amp;TopName=Edward%20George\">reported that</a> the French presidency is alleged to have intervened in another case involving another African leader, this one being Cote d'Ivoire's President Laurent Gbagbo. Gbagbo's wife, <a href=\" http://allafrica.com/stories/200810100149.html \">Simone Gbagbo</a>, was linked to the 2004 disappearance of French-Canadian journalist, <a href=\"http://www.rsf.org/print.php3?id_article=28839\">Guy-Andr\u00e9 Kieffer</a>.</p> <p>Earlier this year, she and an Ivorian minister received a summons from a French court seeking to hear evidence from them. The court had also communicated with an anonymous witness who wanted to give evidence about Kieffer's disappearance. This all sounds like progress, except that the witness lost his nerve and refused to testify, citing pressure and intimidation from the office of the French presidency.</p> <p>All of this amounts to gloomy news for those Angolans who would like to see some measure of justice and equality introduced onto the Angolan political scene. They have just seen the MPLA take a landslide victory of almost 82% in legislative elections that were far from being truly <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200809270014.html\">free or fair</a>. The party, as Angolan writer Sousa Jamba told me, is \"above any criticism, and it will be a long time before the Angolan establishment will be ready for any scrutiny.\"</p>",
  "<p>Apropos what I wrote yesterday about Obama needing to think about every syllable of the Ayers response: Well, he obviously did. That was carefully scripted and stated, and it shut the issue down at least for the time being.</p> <p>It made me curious to go look up Obama's Ayers response from the long-ago debate with Hillary, when George Stephanopoulos asked him about Ayers, on April 16. A comparison is illuminating. Here's the April exchange:</p> <blockquote> <p>STEPHANOPOULOS: ...A gentleman named William Ayers. He was part of the Weather Underground in the 1970s. They bombed the Pentagon, the Capitol, and other buildings. He's never apologized for that. </p> <p>And, in fact, on 9/11, he was quoted in the New York Times saying, \"I don't regret setting bombs. I feel we didn't do enough.\" An early organizing meeting for your State Senate campaign was held at his house and your campaign has said you are \"friendly.\" </p> <p>Can you explain that relationship for the voters and explain to Democrats why it won't be a problem? </p> <p>OBAMA: George, but this is an example of what I'm talking about. This is a guy who lives in my neighborhood, who's a professor of English in Chicago who I know and who I have not received some official endorsement from. He's not somebody who I exchange ideas from on a regular basis. </p> <p>And the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago, when I was 8 years old, somehow reflects on me and my values doesn't make much sense, George. </p> <p>The fact is that I'm also friendly with Tom Coburn, one of the most conservative Republicans in the United States Senate, who, during his campaign, once said that it might be appropriate to apply the death penalty to those who carried out abortions. </p> <p>Do I need to apologize for Mr. Coburn's statements? Because I certainly don't agree with those, either.</p> <p>So this kind of game in which anybody who I know, regardless of how flimsy the relationship is, that somehow their ideas could be attributed to me, I think the American people are smarter than that. They're not going to suggest somehow that that is reflective of my views, because it obviously isn't.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now, here's Obama discussing Ayers last night, after he was raised by McCain:</p> <blockquote> <p>OBAMA: Bob, I think it's going to be important to just -- I'll respond to these two particular allegations that Senator McCain has made and that have gotten a lot of attention. </p> <p>In fact, Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Senator McCain's campaign over the last two or three weeks. This has been their primary focus. So let's get the record straight. Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago. </p> <p>Forty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group. I have roundly condemned those acts. Ten years ago he served and I served on a school reform board that was funded by one of Ronald Reagan's former ambassadors and close friends, Mr. Annenberg. </p> <p>Other members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to be a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican-leaning newspaper. </p> <p>Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign. He has never been involved in this campaign. And he will not advise me in the White House. So that's Mr. Ayers. </p> </blockquote> <p>Interesting. It's only a little bit shorter (187 words to 203), but it's a lot clearer. The mention of Reagan is a clever little touch! Sneaky. This still isn't the whole story of course -- Obama doesn't mentioned the Woods Fund board on which they sat together, but that doesn't make him the first politician in history to fail to volunteer bad information. But the answer, especially the definitive ending, was well scripted.</p> <p>By the way, I was interested to be reminded that back in April, after Obama gave the above answer, the exchange proceeded like this:</p> <blockquote> <p>CLINTON: Well, I think that is a fair general statement, but I also believe that Senator Obama served on a board with Mr. Ayers for a period of time, the Woods Foundation, which was a paid directorship position. </p> <p>And, if I'm not mistaken, that relationship with Mr. Ayers on this board continued after 9/11 and after his reported comments, which were deeply hurtful to people in New York and, I would hope, to every American, because they were published on 9/11, and he said that he was just sorry they hadn't done more. </p> <p>And what they did was set bombs. And in some instances, people died. So it is -- I think it is, again, an issue that people will be asking about. </p> <p>And I have no doubt -- I know Senator Obama's a good man and I respect him greatly, but I think that this is an issue that certainly the Republicans will be raising. </p> <p>And it goes to this larger set of concerns about how we are going to run against John McCain. You know, I wish the Republicans would apologize for the disaster of the Bush-Cheney years and not run anybody, just say that it's time for the Democrats to go back into the White House. </p> <p>(APPLAUSE) </p> <p>Unfortunately, they don't seem to be willing to do that. So we know that they're going to be out there, full force. </p> <p>And, you know, I've been in this arena for a long time. I have a lot of baggage, and everybody has rummaged through it for years. </p> <p>(LAUGHTER) </p> <p>And so, therefore, I have an opportunity to come to this campaign with a very strong conviction and feeling that I will be able to withstand whatever the Republicans send our way. </p> <p>OBAMA: Look, I'm going to have to respond to this just really quickly, but by Senator Clinton's own vetting standards, I don't think she would make it, since President Clinton pardoned or commuted the sentences of two members of the Weather Underground, which I think is a slightly more significant act... </p> <p>(APPLAUSE) </p> <p>GIBSON: Please. </p> <p>OBAMA: ... than me serving on a board with somebody for actions that he did 40 years ago. </p> <p>Look, there is no doubt, that the Republicans will attack either of us. What I've been able to display during the course of this primary, is that I can take a punch. I've taken some pretty good ones from Senator Clinton. </p> <p>And I don't begrudge her of that. That's part of what the political contest is about. I am looking forward to having a debate with John McCain. And I think every poll indicates that I am doing just as well, if not better, in pulling together the coalition that will defeat John McCain. </p> <p>When it comes to November and people go to the polling place, they're going to be asking, are we going to go through four more years of George Bush economic policies? Are we going through four more years of George Bush foreign policy? If we as Democrats and if I as the nominee have put forward a clear vision for how we're going to move the country forward, deal with issues like energy dependence, lower gas prices, provide health care, get our troops out of Iraq, that is a debate that I'm happy to have and a debate that I'm confident that I can win. </p> </blockquote> <p>His prediction seems closer to the mark than hers so far.<br></p>",
  "<p>The United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing <br>and Pipe Fitting Industry isn't happy with McCain's use of \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-johnmccain-barackobama-debate-joe-the-plumber\">Joe the Plumber</a>\" as a campaign mascot. </p> <p>Assistant General President Steve Kelly said in a statement:</p> <blockquote> <p>Last night John McCain made Joe the Plumber a household name. His manufactured outrage on behalf of Joe would be a lot more believable if his economic plan had anything to do with helping working people deal with the economic crisis. Instead, it washes the middle class down the drain. McCain's plan gives massive tax giveaways to CEOs and mega-corporations while leaving working families out in the cold. At a time when our economy is bleeding jobs, McCain also opposes investment in infrastructure spending, which would create good jobs and help put our economy back on solid footing.</p> <p>As the first union to endorse Barack Obama for the presidency, the UA looked long and hard at which candidates would put the needs of all the Joes in America first. Barack Obama has a plan to cut taxes for working people while investing in good jobs and lifting wages. Unlike McCain's, Obama's outrage for the middle class is real. He will turn us in a new direction, not keep us on the same, tired old path of the Bush years. </p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Barack Obama, emerging from the third and final debate against John McCain with his momentum unchecked, today opened up new fronts in the November 4 election battle by expanding into normally bedrock Republican states. Although he warned his supporters at a fundraising breakfast in New York against becoming too cocky, the Democratic candidate is pursuing a strategy that could see him take states that George Bush won with ease in 2000 and 2004.</p> <p>Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, said after the debate in Hempstead that Obama and his running mate, Joe Biden, were now considering visits to states such as Montana and North Dakota, once considered beyond reach. \"I think it is fair to say that we are thinking of going into states we were not sure of at all earlier,\" said Axelrod. \"Some things are opening up for us here that no one fully anticipated.\"</p> <p>Other states coming into play include West Virginia, Kentucky and Georgia. Obama's campaign team said today it would begin to broadcast new ads in these states. Even if they prove to be beyond Obama's reach, his campaigning will force the cash-strapped Republicans to spend money and effort defending states they once took for granted.</p> <p>Obama, speaking before heading to a rally in New Hampshire, warned his supporters against being carried away by his poll leads and the huge amounts of cash coming in. \"For those of you who are feeling giddy or cocky, or think this is all set, I just have two words for you: New Hampshire,\" he said. \"I've been in these positions before when we were favoured and the press starts getting carried away, and we end up getting spanked.\" He lost the New Hampshire primary to Hillary Clinton in January, a shock result after opinion polls had credited him with big leads.</p> <p>A similar warning was delivered on Wednesday by a Democratic congressman, Jack Murtha, who told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that western Pennsylvania was a \"racist area\", and that could cost Obama about 4% of the vote in a state he has to hold.</p> <p>The prospect of Obama and Biden going to North Dakota shows how much ground he has made since the summer, when he pulled campaign staff out of the state, calculating there was little prospect of taking it. Between them, Montana and North Dakota account for only six of the 270 electoral college votes Obama and McCain need to win the White House - a fraction compared with a battleground such as Ohio, with 20 electoral college votes.</p> <p>But the push will not go unchallenged, said a McCain adviser, Charlie Black. He said McCain was expecting a new infusion of revenue to buy up ads in the remaining days. \"I think maybe the advertising discrepancy will be getting a little better this week,\" he said.</p> <p>The Democrats anticipate that at some point Obama's poll lead will narrow and that McCain's team will then begin to talk up the prospect of a dramatic comeback.</p> <p>The Republicans contend that McCain scored some important points against Obama in Wednesday night's debate, by breaking with President George Bush and by painting his opponent as a socialist.</p> <p>But McCain did not pull off the game-changing feat he needed in his last chance to speak directly to millions of viewers.</p> <p>Instant polls gave the debate to Obama by a wide margin. In the CBS survey 53% of uncommitted voters believed he won, compared with 22% for McCain. Some 24% said the debate was a draw. CNN gave the debate to Obama by 58% to 31%.</p> <p>The debate, like much of the past four weeks, was overwhelmed by public fears about economic recession. McCain sought to find common cause with voters, most notably by his frequent references to \"Joe the Plumber\" - Ohio voter Joe Wurzelbacher.</p> <p>McCain also made his most significant break to date with Bush's White House - a move his rival Democratic strategists said should have come far earlier to be effective.</p> <p>\"I am not President Bush. If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago. I want a new direction for this country,\" he said.</p> <p>Obama shot back that McCain had been a loyal Bush supporter. His camp also moved today to neutralise the Republican's efforts by releasing a new ad with footage of McCain saying he had voted with Bush more than 90% of the time.<br></p>",
  "<p>A little more on JTP, as we now know him well enough to call him. Brian Beutler picked up on my earlier post and <a href=\"http://www.brianbeutler.com/2008/10/marginal_taxati/\">took it a step further</a>, making a fine point. Joe, Beutler writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>presumably he earns, and pays taxes on, all $280,000 and has no capital gains. Enter a McCain administration, and nothing changes. Enter an Obama administration and... for $250,000 of his $280,000 (or about 90 percent of his income) nothing changes. </p> <p>What about the remaining $30,000? Well, Under George Bush he's paying taxes at a rate of 33 percent on income over $250,000. That comes to about $10,000. Under Barack Obama, he'll have to pay 36 percent on that same share, or about $10,800. </p> <p>$10,800-$10,000 = $800. As a share of Joe's total income, that's about 0.3 percent. Not even enough to cover the cost of one month of a health insurance plan for a family of four. A really, really tiny amount. If the American dream (plumbing) is so easily crushed, is it really all that it's cracked up to be?</p> </blockquote> <p>I can see that $800 isn't nothing. But if you're making a quarter of a million dollars a year, you have a hard time saying things like \"but $800 is the difference between my daughter getting braces or going without.\" (In America, braces go on kids' crooked teeth; I don't know what you call them, maybe the same thing for all I know.) If you're making $60,000, then sure. But not $250,000.</p> <p>Anyway, because of things like <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27207215\">this</a>, it seems Joe may soon be walking away from the spotlight.<br></p>",
  "<p>John McCain was mad as hell last night. And the pundits aren't going to take it anymore.</p> <p>Media reaction today is mixed on the substance of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-barackobama-johnmccain-final-presidential-debate\">final presidential debate</a> between McCain and Barack Obama. But a number of commentators are weighing in on what may prove to be a more important matter: At a moment when the Republican needed to come across as presidential, he failed utterly by turning in an angry, petulant performance.</p> <p>\"Now we know why Obama's aides were goading McCain earlier this week to raise the Bill Ayres [sic] issue in the debate,\" <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postpartisan/2008/10/the_final_debate_angry_white_m.html\">writes liberal columnist Harold Meyerson</a> in the Washington Post. \"They wanted to play McCain's rage against Obama's measured, judicious, statesmanlike, even a bit boring presidentiality. And McCain obliged them big time.\"</p> <p>Centrist pundit Roger Simon of the Politico - who, by the way, thought McCain was the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/14005.html\">big winner of the first debate</a> - has <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14619.html\">similar thoughts</a> to Myerson. Saying that McCain \"needed a miracle,\" he continues: \"He did not get one. The clouds did not part. Heavenly choirs were not heard. Instead, the American public heard angry attacks from McCain.\"</p> <p>To be sure, there's a split between liberal and conservative commentary today - perhaps a bigger split than there was after the previous debates.</p> <p>For instance, the <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/703pebrm.asp?pg=1\">Weekly Standard's Stephen Hayes wonders</a> - as I did - whether Obama's broad smile during McCain's attacks might have come across as \"an arrogant smirk\".</p> <p>Still, it's hard to imagine that viewers were as put off by Obama's grin as they were by McCain's demeanor. \"The angry energy showed on McCain's face as clearly as in his answers,\" notes liberal <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=10&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=debate_liveblogging_3\">blogger Ezra Klein</a> at the American Prospect. \"CNN, at least, had the split screen, and McCain was grimacing, twitching, blinking, sighing, smirking, eye-rolling.\"</p> <p>Indeed, Nate Silver of the <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/where-mccain-lost-it.html\">polling site FiveThirtyEight.com</a> observes that this \"was the most lopsided of the four events in the post-debate snap polls.\" With those polls showing that viewers, by margins of two to one, thought Obama beat McCain, it's pretty clear that conservative pundit Byron York of the National Review is <a href=\"http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YjM0Nzg0MDc3NDk3YjhkNzYyYjBiODQ0ZWVmNDJiMzE=\">missing the mark</a> by enthusing over McCain's efforts to distance himself from George Bush.</p> <p>At the conservative Power Line blog, <a href=\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2008/10/021787.php\">Paul Mirengoff thinks</a> McCain started strongly and then faded. (In a parallel take, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/us/politics/16assess.html\">Patrick Healy</a> of the New York Times says McCain \"raised the level of his game\" in the early going, but then blew it by turning \"angry\".) Mirengoff also believes Obama was able to elude McCain's attacks on the former radical Ayers and the activist group Acorn by understating his ties - or, as Mirengoff puts it, \"by taking considerable liberties with the truth\".</p> <p>Mirengoff is almost certainly wrong about Ayers. By the end of the night, McCain and Obama had pretty much run through the full stock of what we know about Obama's relationship with Ayers, right down to the campaign event held in Ayers' living room. As for Acorn, Mirengoff may be right - but that issue appears not to have resonated with anyone outside the Republican party's conservative base.</p> <p>Acorn has been implicated in voter-registration fraud. But as <a href=\"http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/223436.php\">Josh Marshall</a> of Talking Points Memo has pointed out, even if Mickey Mouse pops up on the voting rolls, that doesn't mean Mr Mouse is going to be allowed to cast a ballot. In other words, registration fraud does not equal election fraud.</p> <p>Finally, a word about Joe the Plumber, the object of McCain's affections and, to a lesser extent, Obama's as well. Joe the Plumber - that's Joe Wurzelbacher to you - got his 15 minutes (and then some) because he's afraid Obama will raise his taxes. </p> <p>It turns out that Wurzelbacher likes to indulge in the sort of racially insensitive patter that you might hear at a family gathering from a cousin you only see once or twice a year. He <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1008/Joe_speaks.html\">told CBS News' Katie Couric</a> after the debate that Obama had done a \"tap dance\" around the issues, then added: \"He's almost as good as <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9268223\">Sammy Davis Junior</a>.\"</p> <p>I'm cringing. It was, in a way, a goofy complement to the race-fueled hate being heard at McCain-Palin rallies - hate for which McCain refused to take any responsibility last night despite Sarah Palin's loathsome and false accusation that Obama has been \"<a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/13/blackwell.jackson.qa/\">palling around with terrorists</a>\".</p> <p>Following Washington Post political reporter <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/10/13/questioning_obama.html\">Dan Balz's weirdly inappropriate suggestion</a> earlier this week that Obama be held to a higher standard than McCain until election day, there was a danger that the punditocracy would inject itself into the race by ganging up on Obama and helping McCain to his feet.</p> <p>At least in the aftermath of last night's debate, there's no sign of that happening. And now there are fewer than three weeks to go.</p>",
  "<p>Just to set the record straight: Barack Obama is not an Arab. If you don't believe me, I have it on good authority \u2013 John McCain said so. When a woman in the audience told the Republican candidate that she feared Obama because he was the scariest of all creatures, an \"Arab\", the gallant McCain \u2013 who knows a thing or two about dodgy foreigners, having spent several years in captivity with them \u2013 assured her that the Democrat was nothing of the sort. </p> <p>And how does he know? Because Obama is \"<a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/10/11/supporters_jeer_as_mccain_calls_obama_a_decent_person/\">a decent family man</a>\".</p> <p>Being an Arab myself and having lived among them for much of my life, I can confirm that McCain is not just the candidate with the most experience in foreign policy, he has also proven himself, with this penetrating insight, to be the one with the most knowledge of foreign societies.</p> <p>Personally, I blame the whole sad situation on the pressures of modern life and the rat race. Family bonds are bound to break down when men are faced with the tough demands of building a career with a major multinational like al-Qaida. </p> <p>How many fathers can spend quality time with their wives and children \u2013 especially when they have four of one and two dozen of the other \u2013 when they have to spend sleepless nights formulating devious and bloody plans to destroy the free world, brainstorm creative viral marketing and recruitment campaigns, and get the execution just right so as to make a killing on global financial markets?</p> <p>Then, there are all the long business trips to distant places, like Tora Bora, and the gruelling but incomplete training modules, such as learning to fly but not to land, that keep many an executive up in the air indefinitely. </p> <p>Besides, Arab men are too ambitious for their families' good: they chase promotion day and night in the cut-throat business of martyrdom in the hope of gaining access to the executive club in the sky, with its 72 sexy personal assistants and rivers of gushing vintage wine. In the process, most fall by the wayside, burnt out, their nerves shot to shreds, while their families are left to pick up the pieces.</p> <p>As every good conservative knows, children are led astray when there is no father figure around the house. What kind of example is an Arab role model like Osama Bin Laden setting when he walks out on his family, joins a gang and goes so AWOL that not only social services but also the CIA and US army can't find him?</p> <p>Of course, some limp-wristed liberal is bound to claim that she or he personally knows Arab men who are loving husbands and doting fathers. Well, that's just a show put on for your benefit. Do you know what goes on behind closed doors, I ask you?</p> <p>Arab Americans may <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ali-eteraz/arabs-arent-decent_b_134688.html\">take offence</a> at McCain's generalisation and are bound to protest that the family is the cornerstone upon which Arab society is built, and that Arab men generally take family matters very seriously. But what would they know? Self-deception and keeping up false appearances are universal Arab traits.</p> <p>Yes, indeed, it must have been those delusional voices in my head that have persuaded my that my wife considers me a dedicated husband, my mum reckons I'm a loving son, and my siblings generally think that I'm a good big brother.</p> <p>Come to think of it, the legions of caring Arab fathers, generous uncles, indulgent grandfathers, and strangers who make little kids laugh in child-friendly public places that I have encountered over the years must have been figments of my imagination. Of course, too many Arab fathers are a tad traditional and old-fashioned \u2013 although there are plenty of modern ones, too \u2013 but does that mean they are not decent family men? Republicans, after all, have a tendency of equating tradition with decency, and modernity with decadence.</p> <p>Then again, it might be a grand conspiracy to convince the world that we Arabs are ordinary members of the human family, while we quietly take over everything. Liberals, you have been warned: let your guard down against those wily Orientals at your own peril.</p>",
  "<p>Two months after the Georgia crisis, western policymakers are still scratching their heads over what to \"do\" about Russia. The Bush administration, in financial meltdown and heading for the exit, has little useful to say. White House hopefuls Barack Obama and John McCain both identify a reviving challenge from the east but give few clues to how they would deal with it.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/president/debates/transcripts/first-presidential-debate.html\">first presidential debate</a> Obama acted tough, warning that \"a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the [Caucasus] region ... You cannot be a 21st-century superpower and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.\" McCain's rhetoric was similarly offensive. \"Russia has now become a nation fuelled by petrodollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government,\" he said.</p> <p>European countries that rely on Russian energy but fear Moscow's authoritarian new nationalism are less acerbic but no less critical. Yet despite numerous policy reviews ordered after the South Ossetia-Abkhazia conflicts erupted, they also lack a coherent idea of how to proceed.</p> <p>While all parties agree on the undesirability of a new cold war, the EU has again <a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/eu-russia-pact-hold-georgia-talks-collapse/article-176445\">delayed a decision</a> on resuming strategic partnership negotiations with Moscow. Yesterday, European-sponsored Russia-Georgia \"peace\" talks in Geneva were suspended almost before they got started. Next month's planned EU-Russia summit looks like being a very awkward affair.</p> <p>American name-calling and European waffling have further antagonised Moscow, making matters worse. Possibly in reaction to this, influential Russia experts in Washington are now arguing with growing force that the stand-off cannot be allowed to deteriorate \u2013 and that the next US president and his allies must take a more constructive, less antagonistic approach, if only out of enlightened self-interest.</p> <p>\"The danger is the next administration, whoever is in charge, may be trapped in a confrontation with Russia, with Georgia at the top of the agenda, when many other issues, such as Iran, should be taking precedence,\" a US government intelligence analyst said.</p> <p>\"Bilateral relations are really bad, as bad as most people can remember. They won't improve until after the elections, and perhaps not then. Georgia is not necessarily over and we're worried about Ukraine. It's possible the Russians will come up with some kind of legal claim to Sevastopol [where Russia's Black Sea fleet leases a base]. Nato membership for Georgia and Ukraine is a red line for Russia but both Obama and McCain are pushing for it,\" the analyst said.</p> <p>Joining the fray, two former US secretaries of state, Henry Kissinger and George Schultz, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/07/AR2008100702439_pf.html\">warned</a> recently \"this drift towards confrontation must be ended\". They said the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/04/20080406-5.html\">strategic framework</a> adopted by George Bush and the then Russian president Vladimir Putin in Sochi in April this year was a basis for rebuilding ties based on mutual interest. Global non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, energy, climate change, and cooperation on ballistic missile defence were all pressing issues requiring enhanced cooperation.</p> <p>Kissinger and Schultz also argued the problem should be kept in perspective. Russia was not as powerful, militarily, economically or demographically, as it might seem and Russian leaders knew this. \"What they have sought, sometimes clumsily, is acceptance as equals in a new international system rather than as losers of a cold war to whom terms could be dictated.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=22178&amp;prog=zru\">Calls for a new start</a> based on mutual respect have also come from six former US and Russian ambassadors, including Thomas Pickering and Yuri Dubinin, who issued a statement urging \"joint work on global issues where our two nations have the responsibility to lead\". In particular, they said, the two countries urgently needed to update their strategic and other arms controls agreements.</p> <p>Analysts say significant damage inflicted on Russia's economy and businesses by the global financial crisis, and to a lesser degree by Georgia-related western disinvestment, may have sobered Putin and his protege-president, Dmitri Medvedev. The crisis has helped drive home the increasing interdependence of Russia and the west, whatever hostile postures politicians on either side may adopt from time to time.</p> <p>It was no good Condoleezza Rice, the current US secretary of state, expecting Russia's help on Iran or North Korea while attacking it for safeguarding what it saw as legitimate regional interests, wrote <a href=\"http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=22206&amp;prog=zru\">Masha Lipman</a> of the Carnegie Endowment's Moscow Centre in the Washington Post. Her successor needed to be more imaginative. \"The current approach \u2013 seeking to punish aggressive, defiant Russia but working with Moscow in vital areas of common interest \u2013 is not sustainable.\" Lipman went on: \"US anger is only making things worse. The risk of Russia slipping towards an isolationist course and a militarised economy is growing \u2026 The foundations of US policy towards Russia must be revised.\"</p>",

  "<p>Foreigners talking loudly about moving to Canada should \"President McCain-Palin\" or \"Prime Minister Cameron\" come to pass, take heed. My <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/15/canada-labour\">beloved country</a> has just held a pointless <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article4951468.ece\">election</a>, a real doughnut, and made a fool of itself, courtesy of its <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7670934.stm\">prime minister</a>. </p> <p>Oh God, I am so embarrassed.</p> <p>I'm taking the Canadian flag off my luggage tag and telling everyone I'm from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/13/iceland-banking\">Iceland</a>. Now there's a shy puss of a country that screws up with elan.</p> <p>Is there some way I can blame George W Bush for Canada's humiliation? You betcha, as Sarah Palin would say. </p> <p>Our prime minister, Stephen Harper, a strange man with an awkward gait, an absence of social skills, and the dress sense of that guy at the back of the hardware store who sorts nails for a living, is alone in this world in that he still adores Bush. Just as the US is about to turf the man who brought them a disastrous war, Alp-sized deficits and an economic collapse that would give Herbert Hoover pause, Harper this week tried to turn his minority government into a majority one that would transform <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2199929/\">Canada into Bushworld</a>, eight years after it was fashionable.</p> <p>He failed. And he <a href=\"http://thestar.blogs.com/bigpicture/2008/10/so-what-was-the.html\">failed with stasis</a>, which is worse. </p> <p>There are three wings to Canadian political life. Harper, the Conservative PM, is a rightwing extremist, although he doesn't suck up like Cameron. He is an anti-choice, pro-prison, poverty-ignoring, food-safety-privatising, arts-ridiculing, Afghanistan war-loving, cowboy hat-wearing guy. </p> <p>The Liberals, the nation's natural rulers, are in the middle of the road like an expiring woodchuck. They are sensible people without passion; they own just the one house; they're New Labour without the ratlike cunning, without the Cherie, shall we say. The New Democratic party is old Labour.</p> <p>Harper began passing laws making Canada more like the States. His most complimentary adjective was \"CEO-like\". He wants life sentences for 14-year-old murderers, of whom we have maybe three in a nation of 33 million citizens. He wants to build more prisons, ban safe-injection sites for heroin addicts, privatise universal healthcare, make the foetus not just a person, but someone who can dress for success \u2013 you know the drill. </p> <p>And then he passed a law saying election dates had to be fixed, just like in the States. Weird, Canadians thought, but the governor-general can handle that.</p> <p>Suddenly last month, he thought he was sufficiently buff to win an election big-time, so he broke his own new law to call one. A week later, the world economic system collapsed. </p> <p>Canadians worry. We are still hewers of wood and drawers of water, but the spruce pine beetle is destroying our forests. And the Americans want our water to fill the fountains of Las Vegas. They have drones, we don't: they'll have our water.</p> <p>So if we're going down, if we're going to lose our jobs and move back in with our parents and spend a slate-grey winter watching Canadian Idol, we'd really rather not have a prime minister who, when confronted with his own small child at his school, reaches down and shakes the child's hand. We'd like a human being in charge. Hey, maybe someone who gets all emotional about mothers fretting at kitchen tables and such, like the Democrats have. Where's our Obama? </p> <p>Oh quit dreaming, Canadians. </p> <p>So we voted. As in the movie Groundhog Day, where the post-election morning was the same as the last one, with the result being another minority government born of a quiet desperation that won't be soothed until the Liberals get a new leader, not a sweet smart guy like St\u00e9phane Dion, but someone with claws like Michael Ignatieff, a Canadian you Brits took to your bosom some years ago.</p> <p>Thanks for sending him back. It's getting hot here, our trees are sawdust and our ice is melting. Canada needs a smart decisive cynic. Anything to haul that crushed woodchuck off the road.</p>",
  "<p>So where's the \"voter fraud\"? <br> Fox News, and its Rupert Murdoch-owned print brethren, the New York Post, continue to bang the <a href=\"http://bradblog.com/ACORN\">GOP's phony Acorn \"voter fraud\" drum</a>, but as far as I can tell, they've failed to come up with a single incident of any actual voter fraud committed by those dastardly \"left-wing extremists\".<br> Yes, Conservative firebrand <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/CoulterFraud\">Ann Coulter has committed voter fraud</a>, but neither of the Murdoch outfits seem to report on that, even as they go wall-to-wall with misleading reports claiming that the community organization, <a href=\"http://acorn.org\">Acorn</a> is committing massive \"voter fraud\" on behalf of the Democrats.<br> So, as it's now been revealed that <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6508\">John McCain himself was a keynote speaker at a 2006 Acorn rally</a> in Florida, where he declared the group's volunteers to be \"what makes America special\", and as I've been going back and forth with commenters on my <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/13/election-acorn-voter-fraud\">\"Republican Voter Fraud Hoax\" piece</a> earlier this week at the Guardian, nobody seems able to show me an instance of any actual voter fraud committed by Acorn, or even anybody who registered via Acorn.<br> Those who wish to believe in the hoax, however, attempt to link to article after article about allegations of voter fraud carried out by Acorn. And yet, the articles themselves - if one bothers to actually read them - reveal that either 1) They describe allegations and investigations brought by Republican agents, with little or no evidence of any wrong doing, and certainly no \"voter fraud\" 2) Where voter registration fraud has occurred it has been by rogue Acorn employees, originally reported to authorities by Acorn themselves, or 3) Smoke and mirrors are used to cloud the fact that not a single fraudulent vote has actually been cast by anyone associated or registered by Acorn. Let's look at just two recent, oft-linked, oft-quoted New York Post articles from Tuesday and last week to give you an idea of how the scam works and how the rightwing suckers fall for it, apparently, every time. Yesterday, the Post ran an article headlined: <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/seven/10132008/news/nationalnews/4_000_shady_sign_ups_133443.htm\">\"4,000 Shady Sign-Ups: Bogus Voter Booted Amid Probe of Acorn\"</a>.<br> The story is cited by one gullible chump after another in comments at Coulter-wannabe Michelle Malkin's site where <a href=\"http://michellemalkin.com/2008/10/14/acorn-watch-rico-suit-filed-in-ohio/\">she reports</a> on former Ohio Republican Secretary of State <a href=\"http://www.buckeyeinstitute.org/scholars.php\">Ken Blackwell's rightwing outfit</a> in Ohio. They've decided to file a \"conspiracy\" suit against Acorn. Malkin, by the way, is the same woman who also <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200410270005\">falsely reported</a>, just days before the 2004 election in Ohio, that Acorn was registering terrorists to vote there. So this days-before-the-election scam is <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/Docs/PoliticsofVoterFraudFinal.pdf\">not a new one [pdf]</a> for the GOP. It's just being trumped up this year more than ever.<br> Tuesday's New York Post article is accompanied by a huge photo of a snarling, street-lookin' black dude who claims to \"have signed 73 voter registration forms for Acorn\", according to the caption along with it. The story's lead reported: \"An Ohio man who registered to vote several times cast a bogus ballot with a fake address in a vote-fraud case stemming from Acorn, officials said today\" and notes that Darnell Nash \"had registered to vote repeatedly from an address that belonged to an actual registered voter.\" Voter fraud, right? Well, right. But Acorn had nothing to do with it, and you have to read carefully to notice. The story goes on to explain that the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections \"had been in contact with Nash since the summer, and informed him he had to stop repeat registering.\" So the Board of Elections already knew about the problem with this voter months ago. They were already given information about his fraudulent registrations as turned in, and flagged by Acorn, as the organization must do, by law, even after confirming in their quality control process that the registration is problematic in some way. Yet, the story hits Murdoch's Post today, days before the election, amidst a flurry of ginned-up Fox News panic about Acorn \"voter fraud\". Go figure. But the Mickey Mouse nature of the argument becomes more apparent, as the article goes on to quote Cuyahoga Election Director Jane Platten: \"He came in on September 30 and Mr. Nash again registered to vote at [someone else's] address, and he cast a ballot\". So Nash did commit voter fraud, it was caught by officials, and it had nothing to do with Acorn, as Nash registered himself at the county's Board of Elections. Of course, had Nash tried to vote under the registration(s) he filed with Acorn, he would not have been able to vote, since federal law - the Help America Vote Act of 2002 - requires that ID must be shown, when voting the first time, by anybody who hadn't registered in person originally. On that grounds, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Mary Poppins and all the other Disney characters the disingenuous Republicans like to point to as having been \"registered by Acorn\", would not be able to vote either, unless they could prove they were actually Mickey, Donald or Mary. The Post even goes on to describe how the bi-partisan members of the Cuyahoga County election board, \"downplayed any voter fraud\", and how Acorn has been instrumental in helping them to ferret out fraud of any type, by anybody. The election commissioners \"insisted that officials with Acorn have offered any and all help in probing the questionable activities,\" and notes that Acorn has \"fired anyone who was found soliciting duplicate registrations\". \"If one of the 13,000 [people] we hired is potentially a bad apple in the bunch, we encourage the authorities to prosecute as appropriate or anyone that did the wrong thing. We discipline, [and] we fire workers who [abuse their position] ... we encourage prosecutors to follow suit,\" said Acorn adviser Scott Levenson. Levenson \"also strenuously denied suggestions that the group pays canvassers by the number of names they sign up, and that they have quotas,\" which has been otherwise misreported by many, even as a quick check of <a href=\"http://www.acorn.org/index.php?id=12439&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=22384&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid]=12346&amp;cHash=369dbd64b5\">Acorn's fact sheets</a> note that \"Our canvassers are paid by the hour, not by the card,\" and that \"Acorn has a zero-tolerance policy for deliberately falsifying registrations, and in the cases where our internal quality controls have identified this happening we have fired the workers involved and turned them in to election officials and law-enforcement\".<br> Just to be certain, since that point has been so often misreported, I checked myself with Acorn's communication's director, Charles D. Jackson, who told me via email: \"We don't have a quota system. We have a performance standard system based on the quality of the cards, which includes complete cards, phone numbers, good phone numbers, but it's not based on quota. No one has been fired for not completing a number of cards. The number of cards turned in per day have ranged from 12-25, 10-15. Some canvassers turned in between 1-5 cards, and were not terminated. We terminate people when they falsify cards, turn in too many incomplete cards, and consistent bad phone numbers\". So, no Acorn voter fraud in today's much-linked-by-rightwingers New York Post article \u2013 if you actually bother to pay attention.  But the Republicans are desperate to come up with something, anything, that may offer them an advantage at the polls \u2013 now, on Election Day or thereafter in legal challenges \u2013 and seem willing to say and do anything to continue the <a href=\"http://truthaboutfraud.org/\">myth of Democratic voter fraud</a>, particularly by those Acorn \"leftists\" who had the temerity to <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6503\">sign up some 1.3 million</a> low-income (and thus, Democratic-leaning) voters over the past two years.<br> But, how about last week's story, linked up all over the web, and used by Murdoch's Fox News to help kick off the phony frenzy? That one was headlined <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/seven/10102008/news/politics/1_voter__72_registrations_132965.htm\">\"1 Voter, 72 Registrations: 'Acorn Paid Me in Cash &amp; Cigs\"</a>.<br> There's our man Freddie pictured again (apparently he must have registered one more time since this original October 10 report, as Tuesday's Post piece notes he registered 73 times.) And what did that original Post article tell us, as reported by Murdoch's paper, on the same day that the <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6487\">RNC released a Fox News transcript</a> on all of this, verbatim, as an official party press release? That article details how Freddie claims to have been pressured to register 72 times, over an 18-month period, by Acorn canvassers, to fill out registration forms in Cuyahoga County.<br> But note this quickly mentioned point in the report: \"Johnson used the same information on all of his registration cards, and officials say they usually catch and toss out duplicate registrations.\" In other words, Johnson registered to vote, 72 times, at the same address. That, of course, would allow Freddie to cast exactly 1 vote. And before casting it, he'd have to show ID confirming he was who he registered as, and that he lived at that address, as per federal law. Firing up the GOP base, playing to their worst nightmares and darkest (self) instincts, in hopes of wreaking havoc at the polls, knocking folks off the voter rolls and challenging them on Election Day and beyond is all that matters to Republicans. They seem to have no interest in the tens of thousands of legal voters who have illegally been purged from the rolls <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/us/politics/09voting.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=all\">as reported late last week by the New York Times</a>, or the tens of thousands purged in other states <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/us/politics/09voting.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=all\">as reported by CBS News</a> the week before.<br> The once-honourable John McCain knows it, but it didn't stop him from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCB-wGSRzVc\">parroting</a> the same \"voter fraud\" garbage on the stump last week. And Sarah Palin (probably) knows it, but it didn't stop the RNC from sending out a fundraising email in her name on Monday, declaring, \"We can't allow leftist groups like Acorn to steal this election.\"<br> If she believes what the RNC wrote for her, Palin would do well then to call out her her running mate, McCain, for \"palling around with\" those \"left-wing activists\" two years ago, when <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6508\">he lauded them</a> while serving as their keynote speaker at that 2006 rally in Florida.<br> So again I ask: where's the voter fraud?</p>",

Joe is tired of the last eight year of Bush rule, tired of negative campaigning, and just generally tired.

Given the circumstances, it has to be said Danko responded with extraordinary good humour, explaining that he was an old friend of Biden -- hey, Joes have got to look out for each other -- and causing Sliwa's anti-Biden efforts to backfire amusingly.</p> <p><strong>JOE BIDEN:</strong> Fictional character frequently evoked in US politics as a proxy for the ordinary working-class American.

I'm starting to think that everything is okay in this insulated fantasy world. I am the decider and the definer of my own fate. I can be a millionaire with a spin of the wheel or the turn of a card. Well, it would have to be several thousand turns of several thousand cards because I'm playing $10 hands of blackjack. I would need at least a 0week and an amazing string of good luck. This is America. Aren't I entitled to that?</p> <p>I spoke to a man from Texas yesterday who didn't want to vote for either candidate and suggested they should just \"turn the lights off and give it back to us\" for the next four years.</p> <p>He said McCain is the same as the guy we have now and Obama is suspect because he changed his name from John to Barack Hussein Obama. Yeah, I don't know where that came from either. Sources are dubious when all information is untethered and you can just drive your own cherry-picking truck into an orchard of bullshit. I didn't argue with him too much. I suggested that maybe he should be president. He countered with a desire to be dictator. I said fine if I could run the treasury and live in Vegas. He was good with that. I gotta get out of here.</p> <p>I saw Carrot Top last night. Yes, for real. I have run into him over the years, here and there. I was never kind, always mocking. In my mind what he did was a crime against comedy and perhaps a crime against consciousness which I think is a philosophical way of saying \"a waste of time\". I am older now. More forgiving. And truth be told, I had never seen his act \u2013 ever. I knew what he did, I had an idea of what it was, but I had never seen it. I called an old buddy of mine who opens for CT on the road to get some tickets. He said that CT was doing a few political bits. Really?</p> <p>The show is right in the hotel I am staying at. CT pictures everywhere, on every wall, on the door keys, on the game chips. Like a totalitarian country where the leader is a clown \u2013 wait, this hotel is a living metaphor for the truth</p> <p>Long story short. The show was what it was. A show. With lights, smoke, wind, snow, sounds, lotsa props, dancing, farting, videos and a huge classic rock closer. At the centre was this strange, ripped, manic red-haired man who has been at this for at least 25 years. It was a SHOW. He is a professional. I can appreciate that. We are entertainers. He's got a regular show in Vegas and I'm on internet TV show with Sam Seder. Different trajectories. He took the piss out of Palin, Cheney, Bush and Obama in his own way. He didn't linger on politics but he did it. He held up a \"Presidential Ballot\" that had two boxes \u2013 black guy and white guy. That breaks it down. Then he held up an Elmo doll with a penis that pees all over the place.</p> <p>Is Carrot Top part of the problem? Probably not. Is he a waste of time? Maybe. Just depends what you like. Don't hate the clown, hate the circus.</p> <p>I gotta get out of Vegas.</p>",

But he had one answer to almost every economic question: cut taxes and government spending. Unfortunately, what Mr McCain means is to cut taxes for the richest Americans and, inevitably, to reduce the kinds of government services that working Americans need more than ever.\"</p> <p>David Yepsen, the influential columnist for the Des Moines Register of Iowa, wrote that McCain \"did a nice job\", but was unable to shake Obama.</p> <p>\"John McCain lost the final debate of the 2008 presidential campaign Wednesday night,\" he wrote. \"As a result, he may well have lost the election, too.\"</p> <p>Talk this morning turned to McCain's invocation of \"Joe the plumber\", an Ohio businessman who publicly confronted Obama on tax policy recently. </p> <p>The plumber complained that he has successfully expanded his business and said Obama would punish him by raising his tax rate.</p> <p>The Pennsylvania governor and Obama supporter, Ed Rendell, today rejected McCain's assertion that Obama's tax proposal, which would raise taxes on people making more than $250,000 (\u00a3145,000) a year, was \"class warfare\".</p> <p>\"What Senator McCain said is the same trickle-down economics that we've had for eight years and that has turned out to be a flat-out disaster for the country,\" Rendell said on CNN. </p> <p>On the plumber's complaint that the growth of his business would force him to pay a higher tax rate, Rendell said: \"If he makes more than $250,000, he'll have more money in his pocket. I've never seen an entrepreneur say I'm going to stop making more money because the government is going to take more of it. That's just a specious argument.\"</p> <p>Last night's encounter was the first featuring an extended discussion of abortion rights. The prominent abortion rights group, Naral Pro-Choice America, weighed in to the debate today, praising Obama and criticising McCain.</p> <p>\"Senator Obama \u2026 outlined how he will unite Americans behind commonsense, common-ground ways to improve women's health-care options and prevent unintended pregnancy,\" the Naral president, Nancy Keenan, said in a statement. </p> <p>\"McCain, on the other hand, restated his call for the overturn of Roe v Wade. That's no secret: McCain has voted against a woman's right to choose for more than 25 years, and he has even voted against birth control, which is one of the best ways to reduce the need for abortion.\"</p> <p>The Former senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle, an Obama supporter, said McCain \"spent 90 minutes tonight on the attack\".</p> <p>Speaking on MSNBC shortly after the forum ended, he said: \"You know, about two-thirds of the American people think that he's an angry candidate. It looked like for the next 90 minutes he tried to convince the other third he was angry.\"</p>",

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338668531\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1859662862_US-Elections-LT-Black-Roanoke-To-Brightcove-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>The trouble with aspiring to a post-racial presidential candidacy is that the racial realities of America still exist. </p> <p>Segregation (de facto rather than de jure), inequality and distrust persist - hardly surprising when you think how recently racism was legal and how much cultural, social and economic capital has been invested in it.</p> <p>So the fact that Barack Obama has a race problem should hardly come as a shock. The fact that he would have a race problem in north-west Roanoke, the black part of town, however, offers pause for thought. </p> <p>The issue here is not that African-Americans are not excited about this election or Obama's candidacy - they most definitely are. The enthusiasm is so close to the surface that you can pretty much stop any black person of pretty much any age or class on the street and talk to them about the election. You don't have to ask them who they're going to support. It's understood.</p> <p>The issue is that some of the city's black leaders feel the Obama campaign is unnecessarily alienating members of the black community because it is ignoring their local knowledge and connections. \"I don't think it's intentional,\" explains Virginia House delegate <a href=\"http://dela.state.va.us/dela/MemBios.nsf/a7b082ef6ed01eac85256c0d00515644/38e2cb5825d36ab98525738a0052b612?OpenDocument\">Onzlee Ware</a>, who has a good relationship with the local campaign. \"But sometimes intentions are not really the issue. Some black people have felt a little left out.\"</p> <p>This is serious. If Obama is going to win a state like Virginia, which is 20% black and 100% southern, it must win cities like Roanoke (which is 25% black) by a significant margin. It simply cannot do that without the black vote. If African-Americans have a problem with the Obama campaign, then the Obama campaign has a problem.</p> <p>Ware, and some other black elders in town, have taken it upon themselves to use their own funds to mobilise the black community, fearing that a failure to do so might result in Obama failing to reach his full potential come election day.</p> <p>\"The older crowd just don't connect with a 20-year-old white person telling a 50-year-old black person what to do,\" explains Ware. \"Especially how to run their own communities. And then they get discouraged and go back to their communities.\" </p> <p>Whether this represents a generational tension between a local black leadership demanding a gatekeeper role and a national campaign that believes that role is no longer necessary is a moot point. By the time we have worked that out it will no longer matter.</p> <p>\"This is a historic moment,\" says Ware. \"And I don't want to sit down on November 5 and have anybody say it was on me ... We don't have time for no pity party.\"</p> <p>The essential problem is rooted not in race but the dislocation between the rhetoric and reality associated with Obama's campaign. The campaign draws on the energy, commitment and engagement of huge numbers of volunteers - many of whom are working every spare hour to get Obama elected. In that respect, the grassroots nature of his support is very real and central to the strength of his organisation.</p> <p>That has lead some people to mistake it for a movement, when in fact it is nothing of the kind. It's a professionally run electoral machine where orders come from the top down. Those who are involved do not have any say in policy, strategy or direction. They do as they are asked. That is not a criticism. It is a description.</p> <p>The question is how the campaign that has arrived with orders from elsewhere gels and connects with the political structures and cultures that existed before it got there and will remain once it is gone. Where race in Roanoke is concerned, that is no straightforward task.</p> <p>For a small southern town with a sizeable black community the town got through the civil rights era pretty much unscathed. As most people, both black and white, tell it, the city's black elders had a meeting with the city's elected officials and they decided to desegregate. And so the signs came down. There was no marching, sit-ins, hoses, demonstrations, heads cracked, jails filled or lives lost.</p> <p>The benefits of this are clear. The trauma of open confrontation that blighted so many southern towns during that time was not a factor here. The transition from apartheid to normality was handled with the kind of businesslike determination that is rare for an issue of that magnitude.</p> <p>But there were other things that came with the struggles of the civil rights movement that Roanoke lacks. Just two hours drive away in Greensboro, North Carolina, a sit-in by four black teenagers in Woolworths galvanised an entire community. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2000/jul/22/garyyounge\">few years ago</a>, Franklin McCain, one of the youngsters involved, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1578064880/ref=s9sdps_c3_14_img1-rfc_p-frt_p-3215_g1-3102_p?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=1FG8DTW1KJ67EAGJ85YB&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=436516001&amp;pf_rd_i=507846\">told me</a>: \"On the day that I sat at that counter I had the most tremendous feeling of elation and celebration. I felt that in this life nothing else mattered. I felt like one of those wise men who sits cross-legged and cross-armed and has reached a natural high.</p> <p>\"Nothing else has ever come close. Not the birth of my first son nor my marriage. And it was a cruel hoax, because people go through their whole lives and they don't get that to happen to them.\" </p> <p>Black Roanoke never had that moment: a collective period of resistance, struggle and defiance. Consequently white Roanoke was never truly confronted. The city's political class successfully negotiated so that African-Americans could eat where they wanted. But that didn't mean black people could afford everything on the menu. </p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTGeoSearchByListServlet?ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&amp;_lang=en&amp;_ts=242180125919\">census</a>, the median household income of a black family in Roanoke is less than three quarters than of a white family; black families are almost three times more likely than white families to earn less than $20,000 a year, and almost five times less likely to earn more than $150,000.</p> <p>Nonetheless, black Roanoke has had many other moments. For 17 years, from 1975 to 1992, the city had a black mayor, Noel C Taylor. \"If you look at the number of African-Americans we have elected to political office, for a town this size, it's very phenomenal,\" says Ware.</p> <p>So white people in Roanoke have already shown that they are comfortable voting for black politicians. And local black leaders clearly know how to mobilise black voters. The question, with less than three weeks before polling day, is whether the Obama campaign can harness that knowledge and make it work for their candidate on a scale yet to be seen. </p> <p>\"We know how to do this in this area because we do it all the time and we know who the people are,\" says Richard Chub, a 72-year-old former principal and black political activist. </p> <p>\"People say they're going to vote but you have to get them to the polls and for that you need to know who they are.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/16/obama-mccain-debate-presidential\">Wednesday night's debate</a> was without a doubt the strongest, sharpest and most energetic of the three, helped by excellent questions and moderation from CBS's Bob Schieffer, who took both candidates to task.</p> <p>John McCain's performance will be pleasing to his supporters. He came out aggressively, giving his most assertive performance to date, particularly within the debate's first half hour. His most powerful line, which is set to become a soundbite between now and November 4, was: \"Senator Obama, I am not President Bush. If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-johnmccain-barackobama-debate-joe-the-plumber\">Joe Wurzelbacher</a>, also known as Joe the Plumber and now a bonafide celebrity, was mentioned several times by McCain during the course of the debate. Like Sarah Palin's Joe Six Pack, this was McCain's way of attempting to personalise his discussions and appeal directly to voters, although McCain's references to him as \"my old buddy\" and the over-use of his moniker quickly began to appear disingenuous. It was also surprising that McCain focussed on Joe the Plumber who, as a prospective business owner, does not fit the profile of the average middle-class American who conservative analysts have been urging McCain to focus on.</p> <p>The gloves came off \u2013 and the conversation began to veer toward the negative \u2013 when Schieffer posed the question: \"Are each of you tonight willing to sit at this table and say to each other's face what your campaigns and the people in your campaigns have said about each other?\" McCain continued to espouse the same allegations about Obama's relationship with ex-Weather Underground member Bill Ayers, providing Obama with the perfect opportunity to clarify the relationship between the two. \"Mr Ayers,\" he asserted, \"is not involved in this campaign, he has never been involved in my campaign, and he will not advise me in the White House.\" </p> <p>While Obama attempted to bring the matter to a close and come back to the issues, McCain not only belaboured some of those negative points, reiterating Palin's unsubstantiated claim that Obama launched his political career \"in Mr Ayers' living room\", but then did an about face, declaring that his \"campaign is about getting this economy back on track, about creating jobs, about a brighter future for America.\" McCain's enthusiasm for engaging with the negative tonight may continue to work against him, however, with the strength of public feeling about his recent negative campaigning suggesting that people are more likely to agree with Obama's view that the Republicans' focus on Ayers \"says more about [their] campaign than it says about [Obama].\"</p> <p>Although McCain was vigorous, his body language and manner of speaking will also play a role in voters' perceptions. At times, he came across as patronising, sarcastically praising Obama's \"eloquence\", and making what sounded like snorting noises while Obama spoke. His smile sometimes looked like a sneer, and at times his speech sounded over-emotional, appearing to mask anger. Obama, on the other hand, spoke slowly and in a controlled manner. While this may have come across lacklustre, a post-debate CNN poll shows that his demeanour was perceived as more favourable and likable than McCain's.</p> <p>This was very much a debate that highlighted the staunch differences between the two candidates on issues such as abortion, healthcare, economic policy, trade agreements, mortgage bail-outs and foreign oil dependency. The views were polarised, highlighting that undecided voters have two very different candidates, with diverging views and policies, from which to choose.<br>No doubt much fact-checking will be also necessary. Various allegations \u2013 McCain claimed that Obama voted to deny medical treatment to a child born as a result of a failed abortion and tried to delay talks in Iraq, while Obama claimed that 100% of McCain's adverts were negative \u2013 were thrown about during the course of the 90-minute sparring session.</p> <p>Obama had less to do in this debate than McCain, considering that he is already further ahead in the polls and has performed well in the other debates so far. He came out strong on abortion, set out a clear case on healthcare, continued to reiterate his actual policy on tax cuts (as opposed to the one that McCain keeps on repeating), while also talking about education. Obama was as good as usual, which is really all he needed to be, although he too made a couple of gaffes, at one point saying: \"We've got to have a president \u2026 who is also going to enforce unfair trade agreements.\"</p> <p>According to CBS's post-debate poll, 53% of uncommitted voters said that Obama was the winner, in comparison to 22% who thought the same of McCain. CNN's poll gave similar figures. McCain did his best, but at this point in the game, it's unlikely to make a significant difference. At least, however, we finally got to see some actual debating.</p>",

What has been less commented on however, is the degree to which blogging can become part of the theatrical production process itself. </p> <p>A good example of how the web can transform the rehearsal process can be found at the <a href=\"http://heymathew.blogspot.com/\">Hey Mathew blog</a>. This blog \"is intended as a meeting-point for the artists who are working together throughout September and October 2008 to create a new theatre piece called Hey Mathew. The core artistic team (Chris Goode, Jonny Liron, Cis O'Boyle, Jamie Wood) will be posting here throughout the process, using it both as a base for developing ideas and sharing stimulus, and as a living record of the making process.\" </p> <p>It is a fascinating experiment. Rehearsal rooms are usually intensely private places, and so the idea of laying bare what you're doing must be quite scary. But rehearsing can also be a very insular process, as Chris Goode says <a href=\"http://beescope.blogspot.com/2008/10/incidents-will-happen.html\">on his own blog</a>: this is \"one of those projects in whose honour a whole fridge full of food goes rotten because one's never home to eat it\". So what this blog enables the creators of the show to do is to significantly widen their pool of potential collaborators. By following the project's development from day to day, readers can offer their own feedback on and contribution to the work. It will be interesting to see, when the show is up and running, how all of this has affected what is produced. </p> <p>In other news, theatre blogs in the US are becoming ever more dominated by talk of the upcoming presidential election. Most of this does not directly touch on how the election might affect the state of the arts in America. But <a href=\"http://blogs.chicagoreader.com/onstage/2008/10/08/whos-arts-candidate/\">the Chicago Reader Onstage blog</a> has found an extremely useful article <a href=\"http://www.artsactionfund.org/artsvote/default.asp\">comparing the arts policies of McCain and Obama</a> - no prizes for guessing who comes out on top. </p> <p>While we're on that side of the Atlantic, Isaac Butler on the <a href=\"http://parabasis.typepad.com/blog/2008/10/ive-had-it-and-i-need-your-help.html\">Parabasis blog</a> has been getting angry about race. But he is not talking about prejudice against Obama: rather he is focused on how overwhelmingly white the New York theatre scene is. He cites <a href=\"http://mrexcitement.blogspot.com/2008/09/eighty-percent.html\">one statistic</a> which says that while white men make up only 14% of the population of New York, 80% of plays produced in the last year in the not-for-profit sector were written by them. This, says Butler \"is ridiculous. Shameful. And what's more, we all know it.\" He cites the playwright <a href=\"http://charlesmee.com/html/cast.html\">Chuck Mee</a> who describes himself as \"an old crippled white guy in love with a young Japanese-Canadian-American woman\" and who goes on to say that \"There is not a single role in any one of my plays that must be played by a physically intact white person. And directors should go very far out of their way to avoid creating the bizarre, artificial world of all intact white people, a world that no longer exists where I live, in casting my plays.\" So Butler has decided to <a href=\"http://parabasis.typepad.com/blog/2008/10/breakdown-kindness.html\">keep a tally</a> from now on of the racial breakdown of the shows he sees to discover just how frequently white people get cast in roles that do not, inherently, have to be played by a white person.</p>",

He was mentioned 23 times in last night's debate. There are already <a href=\"http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=XibjHnh3IZE\">Joe the Plumber remixes</a> on YouTube, <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Joe-the-Plumber/32179486901?sid=1b2820259301f7c0e73a9556bcb037c2&amp;refurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fs.php%3Finit%3Dq%26q%3DJoe%2Bthe%2BPlumber%26ref%3Dts%26sid%3D1b2820259301f7c0e73a9556bcb037c2&amp;ref=s\">hundreds want to be his friend</a> on Facebook, and words \"Plumber\" and \"Joe\" are the <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/\">two most searched on Twitter</a>. </p> <p>Suddenly it is as if the whole election hinges on his views.

He praised McCain for \"doing better\".</p> <p>But what about being mentioned repeatedly in the debate? <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/16/AR2008101600099.html?hpid=topnews\">\"It's pretty surreal, man,\"</a> he said.</p> <p><em>Based on an extract from the<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/wrap/0,,541579,00.html\"> Wrap</a>, guardian.co.uk's digest of the day's news</em></p>",
  "<p>It was, as one pundit observed, the most we've heard about plumbers in connection with the presidency since the days of Richard Nixon. The clear winner of last night's presidential debate was \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-johnmccain-barackobama-debate-joe-the-plumber\">Joe the plumber</a>\" - Joe Wurzelbacher, an Ohio man who met Barack Obama this week and told him he feared he'd raise his taxes. </p> <p>Both Obama and John McCain repeatedly invoked Joe's name at the final debate in New York state last night, each seeking to present their policies as the ones most appealing to the Everyman he represented. McCain said Obama's campaign-trail response to Wurzelbacher (he used the phrase \"spread the wealth around\") had smacked of \"class warfare\" - the first salvo in a night of attacks designed to put Obama on the defensive. But though McCain confronted his rival several times on the former Weather Underground co-founder Bill Ayers, and on the controversial voter-registration efforts of the Acorn organization, he failed to score the knockout blow he so badly needed. Obama addressed the Ayers issue, reminding viewers that his \"despicable\" acts had been committed when Obama was a young child; and over and over again he drew attention to McCain's efforts to shift the focus of the race from the economy. Instant polls of uncommitted voters all awarded the debate to the Democrat by big margins.</p> <p>McCain sought to turn the confrontation into a classic clash between conservatism and liberalism, Ewen MacAskill and Suzanne Goldenberg write in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-barackobama-johnmccain-final-presidential-debate\">today's Guardian</a>. But despite giving his strongest performance in a general election debate, he struggled to control his all-too-evident annoyance, wearing a rigid grin for much of the evening that sometimes gave way to snorts of irritation. With the odds of victory now stacked against him, McCain is in a fix: voters seem to agree with the Obama position that McCain's attacks are diversionary tactics, greatly narrowing the range of effective lines of campaigning at the Republican's disposal.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama is in New Hampshire today, and McCain is in Pennsylvania; the two then converge on New York City for the Alfred E Smith Dinner, a campaign-trail fixture in aid of Catholic charities. McCain will also appear on the Late Show with David Letterman in what promises to be an awkward encounter: his booking on Letterman's show was one of the few things that McCain actually did cancel when he suspended his campaign last month, prompting on-air derision from the host.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>CNN's instant poll awarded last night's debate to Obama, 58% to 31%; CBS put it at Obama 53%, McCain 22%. Gallup's daily tracking poll showed a slight narrowing, at 52%-44% from 53%-43% the previous day, while Rasmussen's was unchanged a Obama 50% McCain 45%. A new Pew poll finds Obama leading at 49% to 42%, and shows that 47% of voters trust the Democrat to handle the economic crisis compared to 33% for McCain.</p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"Senator Obama, I am not President Bush. If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.\" John McCain delivers his soundbite of the night.<br>\"What could I possibly add? Life happens.\" Bill Ayers himself, confronted outside his university office by a Chicago reporter, makes it clear he'll be playing no part in the election campaign, however many times he's referred to by others.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-barackobama-johnmccain-final-presidential-debate\">McCain tries to fight his way back into contention during debate</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/oct/15/uselections2008-barackobama\">Oliver Burkeman: Liveblogging the final presidential debate</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-johnmccain-barackobama-debate-joe-the-plumber\">Who is 'Joe the Plumber' - aka Joe Wurzelbacher?</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/16/johnmccain-barackobama\">Obama v McCain, round three</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/15/uselections2008-barackobama2\">Pollsters say odds of McCain winning election are 'incredibly remote'</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/us/politics/16debate.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin\">NY Times: McCain Presses Obama in Final Debate</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-assess16-2008oct16,0,2212181.story\">LA Times: McCain deals no lethal blows in final debate with Obama</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.time-blog.com/swampland/2008/10/we_learn_joe_six_pack_is_a_plu.html\">Time: Now We Know Joe Six Pack Is A Plumber</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122411909182439021.html\">Karl Rove: Obama Hasn't Closed the Sale</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/16/AR2008101600109.html?hpid=topnews\">Washington Post: Aggressive Underdog vs. Cool Counterpuncher</a></p> <h2>Mind-boggling hypothetical scenario of the day</h2> <p>Click around the Oval Office in a world where <a href=\"http://palinaspresident.com/\">Sarah Palin is president</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Jon Bon Jovi has joined the parade of American artists attacking John McCain for his campaign's unauthorised use of their music. At this point, US Republicans should scrap music altogether and just soundtrack their events with jungle sounds, bird song and silence. </p> <p>Though Bon Jovi has his hands full with a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/14/job-bon-jovi-sued\">$400bn lawsuit</a>, he took the time out this week to condemn the Republican party for their use of his song, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHIRtJMhxNc\">Who Says You Can't Go Home</a>.</p> <p>The track was played at several recent rallies for Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, according to Reuters.</p> <p>\"We wrote this song as a thank you to those who have supported us over the past 25 years,\" Bon Jovi said in a statement. \"The song has since become a banner for our home state of New Jersey and the de facto theme song for our partnerships around the country to build homes and rebuild communities.\"</p> <p>In other words, it's unlikely that the enthusiastic Democrat \u2013 who hosted a $30,000 per-plate fundraiser for Barack Obama \u2013 meant for the song to be played at a Republican rally.</p> <p>\"We were not asked,\" Bon Jovi said, \"[and] we do not approve of their use of [the song].\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/09/foo.fighters.slam.john.mccain\">Foo Fighters</a> issued a similar complaint last week. Before them it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/08/sarah.palin.heart.soundtrack\">Heart</a>, Boston, Jackson Browne and John \"Cougar\" Mellencamp. Hardly anyone seems to want the Republicans groovin' to their tunes.</p> <p>Of course, the choice might not be theirs. The McCain campaign has emphasised that venues pay blanket licenses, entitling any song to be played at public events. Bon Jovi's Who Says You Can't Go Home, like Heart's Barracuda, is licensed for public performance by the ASCAP agency. </p> <p>Then again, maybe there are some amateur songwriters the McCain campaign could take advantage of. Though a YouTube search for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=obama+song&amp;search_type=&amp;aq=f\">\"Obama song\"</a> yields more than 50,000 results, a search for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mccain+song&amp;search_type=&amp;aq=f\">\"McCain song\"</a> still has some traction. Sure, most of them have titles like I'm Afraid of John McCain, and Two-Faced Flip-Floppin' Liar, but surely a dozen of the 17,000 results will be positive. If not a dozen then at least two. Probably.</p>",

  "<p>The Guardian team couldn't find a bar or restaurant close by John McCain's get away ranch down the road from Sedona so we were stuck in the town itself, where we trooped into the Open Range Grill and Tavern. </p> <p>The bartender refused to turn off the Phillies-Dodgers National League Championship game, and directed those who wanted to look at the debate to a TV in a far corner of the pub. Our Marc Maron ensconced himself among the three or four couples who were scrunched together staring up at the big screen. </p> <p>The debate wore on, with nothing much new from either candidate beyond a few direct attacks on Obama as a pinko who favored the \"redistribution of wealth,'' and pleas all around to do something about autism. That was meant to bring Sarah Palin back into the game--she being especially sensitive to special needs children. And, naturally, Joe the Plumber reared his ugly head as everyman.</p> <p>By the end, the Phillies were on their way to the pennant, and there were only two people left watching the debate.</p> <p>Actually, the house that John and Cindy McCain have occupied parttime for about 25 years isn't in Sedona, but about 20 miles southwest of here near Cornville, in what's called the Verde Valley. This is where McCain and a group of aides known as the \"Sedona Five\" planned McCain's comeback from the political graveyard more than a year ago. More recently, of course, it served as the site of Sarah Palin's debate-coaching camp, where she spent a week cramming after her painful performance with Katie Couric.</p> <p>A local <a href=\"http://arizona.typepad.com/blog/2008/05/dr-word-says--1.html \">liberal blogger has ridiculed the press</a> for referring to the place as a ranch, since </p> <blockquote> <p>McCain doesn't graze cattle or sheep. He doesn't sell meat or wool ... As near as I can tell, the only animals he raises are stocked catfish in a fishing pond.</p> </blockquote> <p>Blog for Arizona's David Safier thinks that the greenhorn city folk have been duped into using the term: \"'Ranch' evokes images of cowboys and horses and cattle roundups and all that John Wayne stuff,\" he writes. \"It makes McCain and Bush seem like virile, independent men of the land,\" instead of the rich dudes they really are.</p>",
  "<p>If <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-johnmccain-barackobama-debate-joe-the-plumber\">Joe the Plumber</a> went for a leak during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-barackobama-johnmccain-final-presidential-debate\">presidential debate</a>, he may have missed one of John McCain's faux folksy invocations, but he was sure to get the many others. It was at least a relief from the relentless attempt by McCain's programmers to avoid issues of substance with ad-terrorem attacks on Barack Obama's fleeting acquaintanceship with a former Weatherman.</p> <p>Obama was probably right in not responding with questions about McCain's relationships with looney pastors like <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/washington_dispatch/2008/05/john-mccain-rod-parsley-pastor-problem.html\">Rod Parsely</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/05/13/mccains_pastor_apologizes.html\">John Hagee</a> or his part in the dry run for the present crisis a starring member of the <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/news/election/mccain/articles/2007/03/01/20070301mccainbio-chapter7.html\">Keating Five</a>. Unless he had backed up such a riposte with a massive negative advertising campaign, no one would have known what he was talking about.</p> <p>And it would have diminished his effective points about the GOP's negative campaigning, which McCain substantiated so effectively, even as he denied the charges, by repeating the slurs on television.</p> <p>McCain several times attacked Obama for his eloquence, perhaps confusing it with the nuance that George Bush disliked so much. Obama was indeed eloquent, and did indeed have nuance, wielding in the debate as in his spending plans the scalpel where his opponent's instrument of choice was the hatchet.</p> <p>There is of course, as Obama repeatedly spelled out, a profound difference between tax cuts targeted at the rich and those at working families, which can't be buried under his opponent's trite accusations of \"class warfare\" and \"spreading the wealth around\". Indeed, except in the unlikely event that the electorate confuses Joe the Plumber with Exxon Mobil, it may be that many of them find the idea of class warfare and spreading wealth quite attractive when confronted with the unacceptable face of capitalism leering at the impending depression.</p> <p>Equally one of the few sharp rejoinders from McCain - that he was not Bush, and if Obama wanted to run against him he should have done so four years ago - was risking his own base, while sounding unconvincing to anyone who may have remembered that Bush and he share a common party.</p> <p>Really, apart from this prick, the rapier was clearly Obama's weapon of choice as much as the scalpel \u2013 when he suggested that some of his accusers had been watching McCain's attack ads.</p> <p>The Republican's statement that \"I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns\" was an admission without being an apology, not least since it was part of his negative attack on Obama, whose dismissal of hurt personal feelings in favour of dealing with real issues like the economy was pertinent and telling. As indeed was his masterful non-negative, damning-with-faint-praise assessment of Sarah Palin's great political capability and ability to excite the Republican base.</p> <p>McCain certainly did his best to follow his coaches' advice to try to look as if he were being nice to his opponent, even if the words belied his contrived bonhomie. He also tried manfully to distance himself, somewhat shamelessly from his party's own president and record over the last eight years. In the end, most voters will doubtless remember that he was still a loyal soldier of the party that, as Obama pointed out, had brought about a record deficit after inheriting from the Democrats an unprecedented surplus.</p> <p>One could certainly disagree with some of what Obama has to say, whether his un-necessarily complicated health plan, or indeed of deference to Joe Biden's foreign policy expertise, but they did represent clearly honest attempts to deal with issues while his opponent attempted to sidestep.</p> <p>I could not help but suspect that McCain had been taking coaching from Palin. At times his gauche attempts to ignore the question in favour of his preferred prepared answers was embarrassing. And that may have shown in his appearance.</p> <p>When Obama faced the camera in direct appeal to the audience, I certainly found it very effective. In contrast, McCain had difficulty focussing, and somewhat disturbingly also had a sub-Nixonian twitch to his eyes that made me suspect that maybe he did, after all, have some of the integrity that has been ascribed to him \u2013 and knew that he was eating his own previous words and reputation in public.</p> <p>If the American electorate has as much sense as polls indicate, the maverick will soon be rounded up and branded as a loser.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain went into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-barackobama-johnmccain-final-presidential-debate\">this third debate</a> needing a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/15/john-mccain-maverick-debate\">\"game changer\"</a>. The trouble for him is that the game has changed.</p> <p>In the lead-up to the 2008 campaign, Democratic sages were lining up to warn whoever won the party's nomination that there was one lesson of past defeats they had to learn: if attacked, they had to hit back hard. </p> <p>Political consultants such as Drew Westen, author of <a href=\"http://www.thepoliticalbrain.com/\">The Political Brain</a>, warned that John Kerry, Al Gore and Michael Dukakis had all gone down because they had let their Republican opponents punch them and punch them again. Kerry had been \"Swift-boated\", refusing to dignify vicious attacks against him by responding to them - and had <a href=\"http://hotlineblog.nationaljournal.com/archives/2008/04/kerry_obama_won.html\">lost an election in the process</a>. </p> <p>Yet in this debate, Barack Obama plainly ignored that advice. McCain kept coming at him - attacking him for his relationship with an \"old washed-up terrorist\", accusing him of \"class warfare\", branding him an \"extremist\" on abortion - but Obama did not do what the conventional wisdom of campaigns past said he should. Sure, he politely tried to set the record straight, but only gently. And not once did he throw a punch back. When asked whether Sarah Palin was qualified to be president, he said it was up to the American people \u2013 and then praised her energy as a campaigner. </p> <p>In the past, that would have had Republicans licking their chops, predicting that their muscular method of warfare would put away yet another meek Democrat. But not this time. </p> <p>True, McCain succeeded in putting Obama on the defensive from beginning to end, forcing him constantly to deal with criticism from the Republican first and setting out his own agenda second. True, too, that McCain had his best debate performance so far (including a firm declaration that \"I am not President Bush\").</p> <p>And yet none of this seemed to trouble either Obama or the Democratic surrogates who spun for him straight afterwards. Emboldened by a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/15/us/politics/15poll.html\">New York Times poll</a> that showed voters disapproving of McCain for fighting too negative a campaign, they concluded that every time McCain threw a punch, the person he hurt was himself. By contrast, the Democrats reckoned that every time Obama remained cool and unruffled, bringing the subject back to jobs or healthcare, he looked presidential - and conveyed that he cared about the voters above all. </p> <p>That was the Democrats' hope, and the instant polling suggested they were right: viewers gave the debate to Obama by <a href=\"http://donklephant.com/2008/10/15/cnn-post-debate-snap-poll-obama-58-mccain-31/\">whopping margins</a>, some more than 30 points. </p> <p>It seems as if something has changed in American politics: these days the overtly negative attack backfires. </p> <p>Rahm Emmanuel, a senior figure in the Democratic congressional leadership, couldn't get enough of McCain's efforts to discredit Obama. \"He comes over as that guy who comes out on the stoop, with his slippers still on, and starts yelling at kids.\" </p> <p>Why is the old Republican method of attack, attack, attack not working this year? The simple answer is the financial crisis. Suddenly, bringing up Bill Ayers sounds trivial and backward looking when Americans are concerned with jobs and bills and their own livelihoods. Obama campaign manager David Axelrod told me that when voters are consumed by \"absolute disgust\" for Washington and its failure to avoid the current economic disaster, they want to hear ideas for getting out of the mess, that and nothing else. The old attack politics no longer works. \"It would be nice if it lasts,\" Axelrod smiled. </p> <p>But it only needs to last three more weeks. Because this upending of the traditional playbook is robbing McCain of the Republicans' usual weapon of choice. And he doesn't have much else left.</p>",
  "<p>I woke up Wednesday morning thinking: If John McCain mentions the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/15/barackobama-johnmccain-debate\">Ayers</a>/<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/13/election-acorn-voter-fraud\">Acorn</a> stuff in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-barackobama-johnmccain-final-presidential-debate\">debate</a>, after promising to run a respectful campaign on the issues, he's going to look like a jerk. If he doesn't mention it, after promising he would, like, 80 times in the last week, he's going to look like a jerk. How does this not work to Barack Obama's advantage?</p> <p>Turns out, there's no way it doesn't.<br> When the two candidates and moderator Bob Schieffer take the stage, McCain and Obama are seated so that McCain will have to put serious effort into avoiding looking at Obama, as he has so carefully done during the last two debates. I half expect him to come out wearing blinders. He doesn't, but when he starts with, \"It's good to see you again, Senator Obama,\" he still can't really look at his opponent. I wonder if there's an email circulating among conservatives reporting that Obama is not just a radical extremist who wants to enslave white America, but that looking directly into his eyes can turn a man into stone. </p> <p>Moments later, I see that if the Muslim Medusa meme has taken hold in the conservative hive mind, McCain has decided to nonetheless brave the possibility of petrification, because now he's staring at Obama in a vaguely unsettling way, blinking rapidly, and, unless I'm mistaken, spelling out \"The Acorn doesn't fall far from the terrorist\" in Morse code.</p> <p>The two senators go back and forth about taxes, the discussion centred around some bloke named Joe the Plumber, who may or may not be related to Joe Sixpack. No big revelations. It's the stuff of stump speeches and soundbites. Obama gets a laugh when he says Joe the Plumber misunderstands his tax plan because he's been watching McCain's mendacious adverts. McCain sighs audibly when Obama is speaking - a tactic (or is that a strategy?) which worked out swell for Al Gore. </p> <p>What follows is the now-familiar scalpel v hatchet debate about management of the federal budget. McCain will enact a spending freeze. Obama says that's using a hatchet where a scalpel is needed. Good metaphor, that. </p> <p>In this section, McCain gets off probably his best line of all three debates when he tells Obama: \"I'm not President Bush. If you wanted to run against Bush, you should have run four years ago.\" But Obama turns it around on him once again, and, while it was a moment for McCain's base to cheer, I'm not sure it will stick with anyone whose vote he doesn't already have. </p> <p>Schieffer asks the candidates if they are willing to say to each other's faces what their attack ads say. This is McCain's big moment; he's promised to \"whip\" Obama's \"you-know-what\". But he doesn't come out swinging. Instead, he whines about how hurt he's been by Obama's surrogates. He sounds less like an attack dog than a petulant child, and nothing like a president. Given his opportunity to respond, Obama says he believes \"the American people aren't interested in our hurt feelings\" and that saying he \"pals around with terrorists isn't an issue\" of interest to voters. </p> <p>Obama looks unflappable. McCain continually tries to interrupt him and looks like he's going to explode. Finally, he does. He spills out a short but fiery tirade about Bill Ayers and Acorn, littered with such hyperbole that Obama actually begins to chuckle. Schieffer gives him a chance to respond, and he swiftly dispatches with both subjects, then lists with whom he will associate as president: wild-eyed radicals like Warren Buffett, Joe Biden and Dick Lugar. McCain responds by rambling some more incoherent bull, punctuating it with a muttered \"The facts are the facts.\" Obama laughs. McCain has done his worst - and Obama emerges unscathed.</p> <p>They are then asked to defend their veep choices - it's pretty boring (Biden's got expertise blah blah; Palin's ready to lead blah blah) until McCain cites as one of Palin's primary credentials being a friend to families with special needs children, and Obama brilliantly revisits the scalpel v hatchet budget discussion, pointing out that McCain's proposed spending freeze wouldn't accommodate the increased spending needed to help those families in the way McCain is suggesting his administration would. It is delicate, but a truly devastating blow. A wound delivered with a scalpel rather than a hatchet, one might say.</p> <p>During the healthcare debate, McCain says he understands that the lack of healthcare is hard on Americans, and, the way he says it, it suddenly occurs to me that, despite the narrative his campaign is pushing that Obama is un-American, it is McCain who talks about Americans as though he is not one of them. Obama says \"we\". He talks through the camera, directly to voters. McCain talks to Schieffer, about the voters. Paternalism creates such a profound disconnect - and, as further evidence, the one moment of the whole evening I feel disconnected from Obama is when he is talking not to me, not to American women, not to American voters, but to Schieffer, about abortion, and revives his tired rhetoric about there being good people on both sides of the abortion debate and about the decision being between a woman, her doctor and her religious adviser. I'm sure those lines play well somewhere, but not in the living room of anyone I know.</p> <p>As that moment passes, McCain makes air scare-quotes around the \"health of the mother\", with regard to late-term abortion exceptions. The \"pro-abortion movement\", he says, has stretched that term to mean \"almost anything\". Ah, yes. Hello there, Straw-Woman Who Gets Abortions Willy-Nilly in Her Third Trimester Because She's a Silly Flibbertigibbet With a Hangnail. Nice to see you again. If McCain hasn't reached the nadir of his appalling campaign with that moment, I don't want to see it when he does.</p> <p>And then we come to the end of the debate. McCain gives his closing statement first. \"My friends \u2026 .\" He is, in case you hadn't heard, a maverick and a reformer who's spent his entire life in service to this nation. Yawn. Obama is going to bring fundamental change. He's going to invest in the American people. Maude help me, I think given the chance he really will.</p> <p>Shortly after the debate, CNN's Wolf Blitzer interviews Hillary Clinton, who was in attendance. She refers to \"President Obama\" at least twice, prompting a celebratory <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/06/obama-racismmuslimunpatrioticscary_09.html\">terrorist fist bump</a> at McEwan Manor between the resident Scotsman and me.</p> <p>Blitzer's colleague Campbell Brown announces the results of their poll: Viewers give the debate to Obama <a href=\"http://donklephant.com/2008/10/15/cnn-post-debate-snap-poll-obama-58-mccain-31/\">58% to 31%</a>. Obama's favourable ratings have increased from 63% to 66%; McCain's favourable ratings have decreased from 51% to 49%. Who spent more time attacking his opponent? McCain: 80% to 7%. Who was more likable? Obama: 70% to 22%.</p> <p>On Fox, Brit Hume and Charles Krauthammer are laughing about McCain's \"peculiar expressions\" and \"eyebrow raises\". (It's the weirdest thing I've seen since the Chris Matthews Ice Sculpture - no, <a href=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v642/shakespeares_sister/shakes3/matthewsonice.jpg\">really</a> - featured on MSNBC this afternoon.) Insult to injury.</p> <p>I'd feel sorry for the guy - if he weren't John McCain.</p>",
  "<p>I almost feel bad for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>.</p> <p>I mean, I thought he was pretty good Wednesday night. He was effective at the beginning. He scored what I thought were some fair, clean shots at Obama on economic policy. He wasn't out of his depth talking about, say, education, which he's never really cared about. Pretty good job, I thought.</p> <p>And still, voters say <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> slaughtered him. </p> <p>By 53-22%, 638 uncommitted voters polled by CBS chose Obama as the winner. CNN was a little closer, 58-31%. All those other measures, who'll do better at blah blah and understands yada yada\u2026Obama, Obama, Obama.</p> <p>I actually don't understand it. I didn't even think Obama was quite on his game. He should have gotten much the better of the economic-crisis debate, but it seemed to me that McCain represented his proposals slightly better than Obama represented his. I even sort of thought that during the abortion segment (although I bet pro-lifers didn't \u2013 McCain may have lost more than a few of them by wandering from the talking points on Roe v. Wade).</p> <p>So what's the explanation for this? There can only be two, I suppose \u2013 the personal and the political, to paraphrase the first-generation feminists. Maybe it's just about McCain. Maybe he just looks like he's ready for the glue factory. It's funny, he doesn't necessarily look that way to me. To me, he just looks like John McCain, the guy I've been watching do this and that for 20 years. He's 20 years older, sure. But so am I. Naturally, I don't look much older to me. So why should he?</p> <p>But of course I'm not most people. Most people haven't been watching McCain do this and that for 20 years. And for those people, I think he does look very old indeed. He sounds old, even more than he looks old. You can hear him wheezing. That whistle every time he makes an S sound. </p> <p>That's an old American stock character in the movies and sitcoms of my youth. The man whose lawn has just been trampled by a young mischief-maker and who storms (such as a septuagenarian can storm) out of the house yelling, \"I'll get you, sonny!\" and the S in \"sonny\" sounds like the air shooting through the gaps in the teeth. So maybe he just comes across like that and there's nothing to be done about it.</p> <p>The other theory of the personal is of course the angry petulance. Again, this is something that I guess I'd quit even noticing about McCain some time ago. But now that I think about it, I have noticed it in these three debates. Obama is Mr. Cool, whether what he's saying makes sense or not. Cool is better than hot, as Marshall McLuhan said ages ago.</p> <p>Or, maybe it's the politics. Maybe 90% of the people who are usually swing voters are just so disgusted with the Republicans that they're not going to entertain the idea of voting for McCain under any circumstances. Maybe it's just over for the Republicans for the foreseeable future, until the Democrats screw up.</p> <p>Whatever it is, I am surprised at the universality of it. Even the much-anticipated Ayers moment came and went like nothing. It lasted three minutes, from 9:37 to 9:40. Obama was ready for it. He answered it well. Issue done. </p> <p>I don't know what McCain does next. Just plays it out, I suppose. He should really lay off the personal attacks at this point and just do his best. If he continues to go for the jugular, if his rallies still get ugly and he doesn't calm them down, if 100% of his television advertising is still attack-based, he now risks permanent damage to his reputation. </p> <p>It isn't over, and outside events can always change things. But the debates en toto make it clear that he can't win this the way he's been running for the last three weeks. And if he keeps it up he risks losing more than an election.</p>",
  "<p>First we had the standing up debate. Then we had the walking around, town hall-style debate. This was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-barackobama-johnmccain-final-presidential-debate\">sitting down debate</a>. It is a good thing, in many ways, that they didn't have to do lots more debates, as there are only so many other positions they could have managed. I think everyone would have liked to have seen some kind of debate in which both candidates were pinned to a wheel and spun around at random periods during the conversation. Perhaps some kind of rolly-office-chair debate would have been a good midway point between the two.</p> <p>It turned out that if you really mean business, sit down. If you want to raise some ire and raise the stakes? Lower the height of the debaters, apparently. Barack Obama and John McCain kicked ass sitting down (though some suspected McCain might have been slipped a booster seat. Or some speed.)</p> <p>Behind them, cursive words (not curse words - that would have been a lot more exciting) scribbled on the blue boards said doubtlessly important and stirring things. This was an improvement on the second debate, whose carpet was the ugliest red anyone had ever seen (Eye-Stabbing Scarlet, I believe) and had walls that were a deep shade of Kick In The Kidneys Blue.</p> <p>Tonight's talking points were clear. McCain's watchword was \"angry\", although with frequent references to \"During the Depression, we had a thing called ... \", he managed to make it sound like he was there first time around. But he suddenly came out punching - or at least delivering sharp pokes with his pokey-pokey stick of negative campaigning. \"And the last president who tried that, was Herbert Hoover\" or Herbie, as I'm sure you used to call him around the poker table, John. Seriously, for a man trying to distract from antiquity, it might be an idea to lay off the familiarity with long-past events.</p> <p>Even recent history seemed to repeat itself, though. \"We want to hear something new,\" the moderator had said at the beginning - but that was something Obama only half noticed, it seems. I swear that if there had been many more of these debates, I would have been able to repeat Obama's word-for-word healthcare answer myself (word-for-word, of course). I know it's an important thing to get across to the voting public, but if I hear about the possibility of \"dipping into the pool that Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees\" one more time, I'll need to get my verruca-prevention socks out, because it is getting crowded in that damned pool.</p> <p>In the end, though, the things they didn't say might turn out to be more important than the things they did. Certainly the constant split screen on CNN gave a master class in \"faces you should and shouldn't pull while not speaking\".</p> <p>McCain, like the rest of his performance, tended toward the dramatic - gasps and uncontrollable yelps in the middle of Obama's sentences, eyebrows flying up to his snowy hairline - while any time not spent scribbling with his sharpie was spent with a fixed smug grin marking his disgust at his opponent's wrongness. Obama laughed in turn, but whatever he was laughing about - whichever specific points in McCain's speech he disagreed with - he never really said, or at least never pulled him up directly. </p> <p>Would it have mattered if he did? Would Obama have tipped McCain over the edge if he'd just once said: \"Calm down, sweetheart, you'll give yourself heartburn?\" Would punching back have won the day? Because he didn't. Obama tried to take the upper hand by remaining the most calm. How much more fun it would have been if he could have been just a little more active with that stick of his own. One good poke and I do believe the top of McCain's head might have popped off. </p> <p>While such an event would have disturbed the Republicans and Cindy McCain, the person who would have been saddest would have been Joe the Plumber, who truly found fame through these 90 minutes. If \"my friends\" was McCain's annoying tic during the last debate, Joe the Plumber was the man of the hour here. By the end of this evening, most people were quite bored with Joe. Joe the Plumber. Is he the one with the six-pack as well? Or is everyone called Joe round these parts?</p> <p>They handled the tough questions well, and with fire, for once. Who would you nominate to the supreme court in the light of Roe v Wade? Well, the obvious person would be Joe. Since Joe has quite so much sway over particularly McCain's opinions, perhaps it would be worth him giving up the plumetry business altogether (if it's not a word, it should be) and throwing his name in the hat for the big gown and the wig. Which, even if they don't wear in this country, they should. </p> <p>Moderator Bob Schieffer poured himself a glass from Sarah Palin's vat of folksy-juice for the sign-off: \"I'll leave you with what my mother always used to say - 'Go vote now, it'll make you feel big and strong.'\" What? She always used to say that? What, <em>always</em>? Like, \"Bob, have you finished your grits? Why then you just go vote now, because it'll ... .\" I do hope so. She'd be a role model for all women. </p> <p>Which brings us to a good point. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/poll/2008/oct/16/barack-obama-john-mccain-debate\">Who won?</a> I don't ever care about that. What's good about their running mates as a potential replacement president, the candidates were asked. Quite frankly, it's the only thing that stuck with me from this debate. What I want to know is whether Palin is - as McCain argued - a role model for women. And if so, in what way?</p>",
  "<p>Forget John McCain, or Barack Obama. Joe the Plumber - also known as Joe Wurzelbacher - was the real star of Wednesday night's presidential debate.</p> <p>McCain raised the plumber from Toledo, Ohio, early on in the debate as an example of the kind of people who would suffer under Obama's tax plans. From that point on, it seemed as if the two opponents could barely get enough of him.</p> <p>Joe's name came up 25 times during the 90-minute debate. The word \"economy\" got 16 mentions. Iraq came up once, and Afghanistan not at all.</p> <p>He was even more popular among the Republican spin doctors talking to reporters after the debate. Charlie Black, a senior adviser to McCain, said Joe the plumber was one of the highlights of the encounter. Tucker Bounds, a McCain spokesman, could barely utter two consecutive sentences without mentioning the plumber.</p> <p>It was clear from the outset that he was part of McCain's secret arsenal on this the last debate encounter before election day.</p> <p>But Obama quickly got into the spirit of things. When he talked about his healthcare plan, the Democrat made a point of saying there would be coverage for Joe the plumber too. When it transpired that Joe the plumber had fears about Obama's tax plans, the Democrat speculated that was because he was watching McCain's ads.</p> <p>Joe began as a walk-on part in McCain's story of how Obama's taxes would hurt small business owners.</p> <p>\"Joe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years, worked 10, 12 hours a day. And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes,\" McCain started off. \"Joe was trying to realise the American dream.\"</p> <p>Obama responded that the tax rises would only hit those earning more than $250,000 a year. McCain said this would include Joe Wurzelbacher, whom Obama had met in Ohio, and would prevent him a planned expansion of his business that included taking on two workers.<br> McCain's team said afterwards the US public will be hearing a lot more about Joe the Plumber in the remaining days of the campaign.</p> <p>One hiccup for McCain is that the plumbers' union has endorsed Obama. The union said Obama was its choice because \"he has always fought for working people throughout his career\".</p> <p>Wurzelbacher, in an interview with FamilySecurityMatters website earlier this year, described his encounter with Obama. He said: \"Initially, I started off asking him if he believed in the American dream and he said yes, he does - and then I proceeded to ask him then why he's penalising me for trying to fulfill it\"</p> <p>He defined his American dream as \"a house, a dog, a couple rifles, a bass boat\".</p> <p>Wurzelbacher told him he wanted to buy his business: \"It's not like I would be rich; I would still just be a working plumber. I work hard for my money, and the fact that he thinks I make a little too much that he just wants to redistribute it to other people.\" He feared Obama was heading down the socialist road.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338652004\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> tried to fight his way back into electoral contention in Wednesday night's presidential debate, painting <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Obama</a> as a class warrior who has failed to own up to his links to a 1960s-era radical.</p> <p>McCain, at his most cheerful and pugnacious in this third and final debate, sought to turn the election into a classic clash between conservatism and liberalism.</p> <p>The tensest moments came when McCain raised Obama's relationship with \"the washed out terrorist\" Bill Ayers, one of the founders of the Weathermen group responsible for a bombing campaign across the US. </p> <p>Obama said Ayers had been engaged in \"despicable acts\" but he was now a professor and the two sat on the same education board in Chicago.</p> <p>Although he rambled at some points, McCain had a strong performance, producing a few memorable lines about taxes and socialism that could resonate in the remaining 19 days before election day. But it is unlikely to be the game-changer he had hoped for.</p> <p>A CNN instant poll awarded the debate to Obama, who secured 58% to McCain's 31%. A CBS poll gave it as Obama 53% to McCain's 22%.</p> <p>The most dramatic moment of the debate came when McCain finally repudiated, as some of his advisers have been pleading with him to do for months, George Bush, whose unpopularity has been a drag on his campaign.</p> <p>Looking directly across the table at Obama, who has sought to present him as Bush 2.0, McCain said: \"Senator Obama, I am not President Bush. If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.\"</p> <p>Obama did not relent. Though he praised McCain for opposing Bush on torture, Obama said the two Republicans pursued virtually identical economic policies: \"On the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.\"</p> <p>The debate at Hofstra University, in New York on Long Island was the most free-ranging and combative encounter between the two opponents, with many sensitive issues raised.</p> <p>Both delivered strong finishes. McCain, speaking directly into the camera, offered up his lifetime of public service. Obama returned to his defining message of change. But he also borrowed a page from John Kennedy, saying that the American people had to demonstrate greater civic responsibility.</p> <p>The 90-minute encounter was marked by McCain making a series of attacks in an attempt to extract every possible gain from this last high-profile engagement before the November 4 vote.</p> <p>But the Republican also took efforts to avoid alienating viewers. With the two men seated within an arms' length of one another, the Republican warmed up his demeanour towards Obama.</p> <p>Unlike earlier in debates, he made regular eye contact with Obama as well as smiling often, even while delivering jibes.</p> <p>The tensest exchanges were when the two directly confronted one another for the first time face-to-face over the smears, lies and inflammatory remarks that have marred the campaign in recent weeks.</p> <p>Until tonight, most of the negative campaigning had been left to surrogates such as McCain's running-mate, Sarah Palin, or to television ads.</p> <p>But the two were invited by the debate moderator, the CBS anchor Bob Schieffer, to comment on the Obama campaign's characterisation of McCain as \"erratic\" and the McCain team's description of Obama as \"dangerous\" and \"palling around with terrorists\".</p> <p>McCain said he regretted some of the remarks that been made but it had been \"a very tough campaign\". Looking almost tearful, McCain said he had been hurt by remarks by the congressman John Lewis that linked him to America's segregationist past.</p> <p>Obama, responding, said Lewis's remarks had been prompted by the some of the incendiary calls coming from the crowd at McCain and Palin rallies.</p> <p>In a later exchange, McCain lifted the spirits of Republicans by delivering a series of attacks intended to cast Obama as a socialist. He accused his Democratic rival of being a stereotypical liberal who would use taxes to redistribute wealth, and who wanted to impose a socialist healthcare system like Canada.</p> <p>In perhaps his last best chances to reverse his political decline, McCain said: \"The whole premise behind Senator Obama's plans are class warfare plus spread the wealth around.\"<br> The focus on the economy marked yet another change of tactics for McCain as he tries to regain his footing in a campaign overwhelmed by voters' fears about the financial crisis.</p> <p>Throughout the debate, McCain tried to show he was capable of connecting with ordinary Americans. An early exchange saw him talking about a conversation with a plumber in Ohio - who became a recurring conversation topic in the debate. </p> <p>\"Senator Obama talks the very, very rich ... what you want to do to Joe the plumber and millions more like him is raise their taxes and not allow them to realise the American dream.\"</p>",

John McCain's plan is to double-down on the same risky bet we've been making the last eight years hoping for our luck to change.\" </p> <p>This gambling riff started a couple of weeks back when Obama, stumping in Colorado, used it to <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/obama_mccain_doesnt_get_that_c.php\">attack McCain's resolutely freemarket policies</a>: \"I know that when Senator McCain says he wants to bring the same kind of deregulation to our health care system that he helped bring to our banking system--his words--well, that's a bet we can't afford,\" Obama said. \"We can't afford to roll the dice by privatizing Social Security, and wagering the nest egg of millions of Americans on Wall Street. We can't afford to gamble on more of the same trickle down philosophy that showers tax breaks on big corporations and the wealthiest few.\"</p> <p>It doesn't help McCain that when it comes to gambling, there's a disconcerting parallel between the political and the personal. Back in July, a Time magazine piece highlighted the two candidates' gambling habits: While <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1819898-2,00.html\">Obama regularly joined Illinois colleagues in low-ante poker games</a>, where success depends upon \"diligently executing a premeditated strategy,\" it said, McCain preferred high-stakes casino craps tables, where he could indulge his penchant for \"living dangerously.\" The piece inspired numerous discussions\u2014most of them pretty lightweight\u2014concerning what these predilections revealed about the two candidates' characters.</p> <p>Then, two weeks ago, the New York Times published a major investigative piece outlining the \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/us/politics/28gambling-web.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin\">close relationship [McCain] has built with the gambling industry</a> and its lobbyists during his 25-year career in Congress,\" and showing that \"more than 40 fund-raisers and top advisers have lobbied or worked for an array of gambling interests\u2014including tribal and Las Vegas casinos, lottery companies and online poker purveyors.\" Ken Silverstein of <a href=\"http://harpers.org/archive/2008/09/hbc-90003629\">Harper's wrote a damning follow-up</a>. </p> <p>The Democrats pounced on the story, producing a new TV spot under the slogan: \"Betting on McCain?\"</p> <p>In hard financial times, voters are risk-averse and look for a steady hand. If the latest polls numbers are any indication, the McCain-as-gambler strategy may well be working\u2014aided, no doubt, by McCain's own erratic behavior, and a national economy that suddenly seems no less risky than a Vegas roulette wheel.</p>"
