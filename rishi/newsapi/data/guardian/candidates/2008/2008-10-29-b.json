  "<p>This Khalidi business is really desperate nonsense. OK, Obama went to his going away party as he left the University of Chicago for Columbia. But John McCain, reports Seth Colter Walls, did <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/28/mccain-funded-work-of-pal_n_138606.html\">a little more than that</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>In regards to Khalidi, however, the guilt-by-association game burns John McCain as well. </p> <p>During the 1990s, while he served as chairman of the International Republican Institute (IRI), McCain distributed several grants to the Palestinian research center co-founded by Khalidi, including one worth half a million dollars.</p> <p>A 1998 tax filing for the McCain-led group shows a $448,873 grant to Khalidi's Center for Palestine Research and Studies for work in the West Bank. (See grant number 5180, \"West Bank: CPRS\" on page 14 of this PDF.)</p> <p>The relationship extends back as far as 1993, when John McCain joined IRI as chairman in January. Foreign Affairs noted in September of that year that IRI had helped fund several extensive studies in Palestine run by Khalidi's group, including over 30 public opinion polls and a study of \"sociopolitical attitudes.\"</p> <p>Of course, there's seemingly nothing objectionable with McCain's organization helping a Palestinian group conduct research in the West Bank or Gaza. But it does suggest that McCain could have some of his own explaining to do as he tries to make hay out of Khalidi's ties to Obama.</p> </blockquote> <p>Don't these people vet anything? Of course they don't. Because the idea, as <a href=\"http://washingtonindependent.com/15650/mccain-pushes-obama-link-to-islamic-terror\">Brad DeLong note</a>s, is simply:</p> <blockquote> <p>the convergence of Obama, Ayers and someone with an Arabic name is a perfect bundle for McCain, particularly in South Florida \u2014 home to lots and lots of Jews. People weren't really buying the Ayers-Obama tie, but with Khalidi in the mix, the new implication is: Obama is connected to Ayers, a former domestic terrorist; both are connected to a Muslim who reputedly was connected to the PLO, which was viewed by Israel as a terrorist organization. Ergo, Obama is connected to Islamic terrorism. Throwing a representative of the elite liberal media into the narrative doesn't hurt either.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hypocrisy and slime. How many months, again, before McCain pulls out his violin and offers an apology for the things he was \"forced\" to do during this campaign?<br></p>",
  "<p>This has been kicking around for a day, and I was on a plane and so forth, but still, if you haven't seen <a href=\"http://rawstory.com/news/2008/Joe_The_Plumber_attacks_Obama_would_1028.html\">this video</a> of Fox News's Shepard Smith pushing back hard on Joe the Unlicensed One for saying that an Obama victory would be the death of Israel then really, I must insist that you drop what you're doing and watch it. You will quake in disbelief.</p> <p>A Rubicon has been crossed when Fox News is defending Obama on the subject of Israel. It's only a shame that this nincompoop -- who, remember, doesn't actually make anywhere near $250,000 -- will get a larger tax cut under Obama than he would under McCain. Maybe an Obama administration could deny him his chunk and use it to buy Israel bonds.<br></p>",
  "<p>For years now, ABC Radio and Fox News Channel star Sean Hannity has kissed his callers goodbye by telling them: \"You're a great American.\" But he seems to have convinced at least some of his fans that they somehow love their country - and mine - more than those who didn't call or write to say they agreed with whatever nonsense Hannity was spewing on any particular day.<br> Recently, Sarah Palin <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/17/palin-clarifies-what-part_n_135641.html\">spoke</a> at a fundraiser in North Carolina about small towns she believed to be the \"real America\" as the \"very patriotic ... pro-America areas of this great nation.\"<br> The next day, Michelle Bachman, Republican congresswoman from Minnesota, may have hit the eject button from her own, otherwise safe US House seat by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbw4pdxVSOg\">telling</a> MSNBC's Chris Matthews that she believed Barack Obama was \"anti-American\" and that she wished \"the American media\" would do an investigative expos\u00e9 to determine \"the views of the people in Congress and find out, are they pro-America or anti-America.\"<br> The day after that, Nancy Pfotenhauer, an adviser to John McCain, <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/10/18/real-virginia/\">told</a> a reporter that only the part of Virginia supporting the Republican presidential nominee was the \"real Virginia\".<br> The remarks of all three women came after the McCain campaign, with its poll numbers sinking, spent days calling Obama the equivalent of a terrorist and/or communist. And that was the polite stuff. After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/16/republicans-acorn-voter-fraud\">specious Republican allegations</a> that it was committing voter fraud, offices of the community organising group Acorn were <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/251/story/54360.html\">ransacked and burglarised</a> in several states, and its employees were met with death threats. They were deluged with threatening and <a href=\"http://www.prosebeforehos.com/word-of-the-day/10/15/al-jazeera-exposes-racism-at-sarah-palin-rally-in-ohio/?red\">racist phone messages and email</a>, including: \"Hi, I was just calling to let you all know that Barack Obama needs to get hung. He's a fucking nigger, and he's a piece of shit. You guys are fraudulent, and you need to go to hell. All the niggers on oak trees. They're gonna get all hung honeys, they're gonna get assassinated, they're gonna get killed.\"</p> <p>Powder-laced packages and death threats were <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6539\">sent to the office of Jennifer Brunner</a>, Ohio's Democratic secretary of state, after she had the temerity to fight back against Republican party lawsuits alleging voter fraud (again, with no actual evidence to back up the suppressive fear-mongering). She was forced to set the secretary of state website into \"static mode\" temporarily following \"security breaches\" on the site. That came at the height of voter interest in election information the site carried following a \"barrage [of] menacing messages and even threats of harm or death,\" according to <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6539\">a statement</a> from Brunner's office.<br> The official Republican website in Sacramento County, California was caught <a href=\"http://rawstory.com/news/2008/GOP_site_that_linked_Obama_bin_1015.html\">featuring</a> a graphic that read: \"The only difference between Obama and Osama is BS.\" Another graphic, in the fashion of a political bumper sticker, urged people to \"Waterboard Barack Obama.\"<br> In Indiana, an election official <a href=\"http://www.americablog.com/2008/10/indiana-election-official-calls-obama.html\">distributed</a> copies of an email describing Obama as a \"young, black Adolf Hitler\".<br> In Chicago, some Obama supporters found <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-villa_park_signoct17,0,1501910.story\">hand-written notes</a> in their mailbox which read: \"Get the Obama signs off your property \u2013 now. ... Failure to obey this order will result in the immediate death of all family members.\"<br> A dead bear was discovered at a North Carolina university campus last week. \"It looked like it had been shot in the head,\" said campus security. \"A couple of Obama campaign signs had been stapled together and stuck over its head.\" Given the rhetoric from Republican officials, including Palin and McCain, can anyone be surprised that things continue to escalate? No, it's not new. The US owns a dark history of blood, evil and oppression. Unspeakable terror was wrought against African-Americans in the decades following the US civil war, after they were blessed with a right to vote. In 1964, three civil rights workers - James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner - were killed in cold blood for having the temerity to try and register to vote those lost minority voices in the deep American south.</p> <p>Now, for the last eight years, the very people who would threaten a community worker with death for registering voters, or send a powder-laced package of hate to a secretary of state, or kill a bear to terrorise a town, or equate the most evil of terrorists with a presidential candidate in hopes of intimidating him and his supporters have been told by the loudest and most powerful people in the land - on radio, television and print, and from the very bully pulpit of the White House - that they are the \"great Americans\". They have been told that they, and they alone, support the troops who fight and die, ostensibly to assure our freedoms. Those cruelly used and misled must now come to terms with the fact that their wonderland is giving way to the welcome, if much too slow, return of a reality-based world in which they are relegated to the margins. Who can blame them for having a few issues with anger and denial right about now?<br> But all is not lost. Following Bachman's comments, her hitherto unknown Democratic opponent in the Minnesota congressional race received more than a million dollars in campaign contributions. The congresswoman's once-safe seat was downgraded to \"leans Republican\" by the political scientists, and the Republican party, seeing the writing on the wall, all but gave up the ghost on her by pulling TV ads and money out of that fight. She'll be left alone to <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/new_poll_bachmann_fighting_for.php\">twist in the wind</a> of her own misguided ideas of America, anti-Americanism and the real price paid for freedom.<br> The worst have been told they are the best Americans for nearly a decade by Hannity, by Bush, by Rove, by those who played along to fool the easily fooled. The triumph of good over evil will not come without a price. But come it will.</p>",
  "<p>Attempting to scare swing voters onto their side in the US presidential campaign, the McCain-Palin ticket has taken to <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-campaign19-2008oct19,0,1946625.story?track=rss\">throwing around the term \"socialism\"</a> to define Barack Obama's argument in support of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/22/john-mccain-barack-obama-socialism\">progressive taxation</a>. The latter will create more equality, or in Obama's own words, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owA2geM8OGg\">\"spread the wealth around\"</a>. Yet while Obama, with billionaire businessman Warren Buffett and former US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker among his top financial advisers, may support a more equitable America, he is no socialist.<br> Which isn't to say that an Obama administration couldn't inspire socialist policies or attitudes. And to my mind, that's nothing to be ashamed of. As someone whose secular \"rabbis\" were socialist thinkers, like the late writer and activist Michael Harrington and the literary and political thinker and Yiddishist Irving Howe, I find it intriguing and inspiring to hear this debate - though not as it's being framed by McCain. </p> <p>There has long been a progressive, home-grown socialist tradition in the US, even if in recent decades it has waned - until perhaps now. At the turn of the 20th century, it was the middle-American socialism of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_V._Debs\">Eugene Debs</a>, whose Indiana, trade-union roots helped him lure hundreds of thousands of passionate urban Jewish immigrants to his cause. During the 1950s and 1960s, it was the urbane, religiously inspired socialism of Norman Thomas, an ordained Presbyterian minister from Ohio, who served as the moral voice of a nation, famously telling protesters in one of the earliest demonstrations against the Vietnam war: \"We have come to cleanse the [American] flag, not to burn it.\" </p> <p>Harrington took his inspiration from Dorothy Day's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Worker_Movement\">Catholic Worker movement</a>. His 1962 book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Other-America-Poverty-United-States/dp/068482678X\">The Other America</a> inspired another president - Lyndon Johnson - to declare a \"war\" on poverty. Harrington died in 1989, but his writings are as prescient today as they were when he wrote them. He sometimes called his philosophy \"republican socialism\", harkening back to the founding principles of the nation, when the US broke from the English monarchy to create a republic of citizens, rather than be subjects of the crown. </p> <p>Years ago, I was given a framed broadside of socialist inspiration as a gift from a family member of another well-regarded American socialist, Sidney Hillman. A rabbi's grandson, Hillman came from Russia to America, founded the Amalgamated Clothing Workers union and was a key player in domestic politics during Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. Today, these words of Harrington hang above my desk:</p> <blockquote> <p>I insist that the political, social and economic development of modern society points socialism toward an ethical, multiclass, and decentralised conception of its goal based on the democratisation of the workplace and the creation of new forms of community, both within the nation and throughout the world. That vision has a remarkable continuity with the basic republican values that derives from both the French and the American revolutions.</p> </blockquote> <p>Obama's stance is significant, not because he has proclaimed allegiance to socialist ideology - he hasn't - but rather because he is expressing support for notions of social solidarity and interdependency and government intervention akin to European social democracy. Surely the majority of Americans don't link these values to any kind of socialist strain. Unlike Europe, socialism and social democracy are not even part of the American political scene. But Americans are searching for a vision of society different from our present one. That's why the Democratic candidate has been speaking to overflow crowds throughout the campaign. Obama has ignited a generation that may know little about the grand political arguments of an earlier era, but that feels - and \"feels\" is the operative word - that something is terribly wrong.</p> <p>Americans are hungry for an end to the inequality and social meanness that have exemplified the Bush years. With record-breaking gaps between the rich and the poor, driven by policies that emphasised privatisation, deregulation and lack of government supports, the America the next president will inherit was in deep financial distress even before the recent global financial crash. But we have also been in emotional distress. As we privatised the economy, so too, we privatised social life and the public sphere. And that's where the socialist model is a useful one. It's about engaging people in civic life, recreating a public square that is applicable to a 21st-century world. </p> <p>American socialism was always more about trade union syndicalism, religious values, communitarianism and a profound belief in small \"d\" democracy, small \"r\" republicanism. It was also staunchly anti-authoritarian. (The significant exception to this, of course, was the American Communist party, which drew its ideology from an authoritarian model.) </p> <p>\"Can we really create a space for personal and community freedom in a modern society?\" Harrington wondered. \"No one can be sure. All we can say with confidence is that if such freedom is to come into existence, it will be the result of new global structures of solidarity and justice. Which is to say, of socialism.\"</p> <p>On November 5, when the world wakes up to a new American president, perhaps it will have its answer.</p>",
  "<p>Let's make an assumption \u2014 perhaps a rash one but certainly one that the polls all now imply. This time next week it will be day one of the rest of Sarah Palin's political career. Is that all there is? Will these last two months have been as good as it ever gets for the much derided Alaska governor? Or will defeat nevertheless be the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/us/politics/29palin.html\">springboard to a bigger nomination</a> in four or eight years' time, with Palin as the Republicans' considered choice to unseat or follow President Obama? Is she, in short, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/23/sarah-palin-2012-election\">Republican history</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/23/sarahpalin-uselections2008\">Republican promise</a>?</p> <p>The boring but true answer is that it is much too soon to say and that many months will pass before the answer begins to assume a clear shape. It is beyond question that Palin will <a href=\"http://features.csmonitor.com/politics/2008/10/26/palin-pushes-mccain-staff-aside-as-blame-game-begins/\">get a lot of the blame</a> if Obama wins next week. She will be attacked both as an <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081019/ap_on_el_pr/powell\">inadequately qualified vice-presidential choice</a> \u2014 the Colin Powell critique \u2014 and as an excessively polarising one \u2014 the apparent view of many independents who have tipped to Obama after rejecting John McCain's choice of running mate after listening to the way she campaigns. There will be questions, too, about the Alaska factor \u2014 the issue of whether a candidate from such a unique and unfamiliar state can ever have sufficient wider appeal in middle America. And there will be mutterings, more private than public but important nonetheless, about whether <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/10/27/081027fa_fact_mayer\">putting a woman like her on the ticket</a> is really such a smart idea after all. </p> <p>Palin's supporters will counter that she energised the Republican ticket at a crucial time and in ways that no one else could have rivaled. They will say she brought millions of conservative voters and some serious conservative money back into the GOP fold. They will say that the problem in 2008 was McCain's age, message, character or tactics \u2014 and that Palin merely did what she could to rescue a doomed ship. They will say that this was always going to be a Democratic year anyway. And they will say that, however the Republican party now chooses to reinvent itself, the party will need to bind the Palin conservatives in \u2013 not try to freeze them out.</p> <p>The reality is that Palin will take a lot of flak over the coming weeks and months but she can still be a player if she chooses to be one \u2014 something that McCain, who will be history from Wednesday, certainly will not be. The eventual outcome will mainly depend, I think, upon two things. </p> <p>First, it will depend upon whether Palin is smart enough and determined enough to reinvent herself as someone with a Republican narrative that speaks to the moderates who the conservatives who feel their party has somehow been taken from them. If there is one question Palin might usefully ask herself each morning over the next two years it is this: how can the Republican party win California again? It is 20 years now \u2014 five elections \u2014 since a Republican presidential candidate <a href=\"http://www.multied.com/elections/1988state.html\">won California's massive sack full of electoral college votes</a> \u2013 yet in the preceding 40 years Republicans won the state every time except in 1964. If Palin can surround herself with enough smart people to come up with a strategy that would win in California she will embody the party's answer \u2013 not its problem.</p> <p>The second thing that will matter will be how Obama governs. If Obama manages to translate a 2008 win into a successful governing strategy and record on health, the budget, energy and foreign policy then it won't be Palin's fault if she has little to offer against him in 2012 \u2014 because no one else will be able to do that either. But if Obama gets it wrong, presides over a deepening recession and intractable wars, and alienates middle America, then his coalition may begin to unravel. In that case, Palin becomes the Anyone But Obama candidate.</p> <p>I think Palin should take her example from another female politician who was mocked and patronised, satirised and underestimated, but who eventually reinvented herself as the improbable answer to a nation's crises and who seized her chances when they came along. Margaret Thatcher wasn't always the Margaret Thatcher we think of today. In the early 1970s she was widely considered unimpressive, inflexible, unappealing and a disaster \u2014 and that was just what her parliamentary colleagues thought. But Thatcher had three big things going for her. First, she had a lot of legislative and executive experience. Second, she liked ideas and was willing to listen. Third, she had the audacity to go with her ambition. Over time she reinvented herself not just as a politician with a political purpose but as a politician who could connect with non-traditional voters. The rest is history.</p> <p>I'm not at all saying that Palin should simply ape everything that Thatcher did. Different times and different societies require different answers. But it is Thatcher \u2013 not Thatcherism \u2013 that offers the lesson fro Palin right now. There was a time when Thatcher was a figure of scorn among male politicians and commentators rather in the same way that Palin is now. Thatcher made her critics swallow their words. The test of Sarah Palin will be whether she has the right combination of artful bloody-mindedness to do the same.</p>",
  "<p>Will every vote cast this election season count? Of the possible snafus that could occur on November 4, from malfunctioning voting machines to insufficient ballots, one issue that hasn't gotten much attention is provisional voting. Essentially a stop-gap measure, provisional balloting assures that people whose names do not appear on voter registration lists due to bureaucratic errors (or who have other troubles) can exercise their right to vote.</p> <p>Provisional voting got traction after the administrative debacle of the 2000 presidential election when millions of people were turned away from the polls, many because of problematic voter rolls. Two years later, Congress mandated provisional voting nationwide as part of a larger package of election reforms known as the <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/hava/hava.htm\">Help America Vote Act</a> or HAVA, to insure that everyone who is eligible to vote can. End of story, right? Not quite. </p> <p>Today, many state and local election officials despise provisional voting. Why? Even within a state, provisional voting requirements can be subject to conflicting interpretations by election officials. Sorting out who should get a provisional ballot on election day and researching voter eligibility afterwards is a confusing and time-consuming exercise. </p> <p>So stuff happens. The Pew Centre for the States/Electionline.org's <a href=\"http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/uploadedFiles/Election Preview FINAL.pdf\">Election 2008 Preview</a> (pdf) documents that in more than half of the states that use provisional ballots, a person who thinks they are registered must vote in the correct precinct. Go to the wrong polling place, and your vote won't get tabulated. Some poll workers even use provisional ballots to pacify irate people in situations where the ballot may not solve the actual problem, such as missing the voter registration deadline. (Most state cutoffs fall in early or mid October.)<br> In Massachusetts, residents also get tripped up by a quirk in the <a href=\"http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/nvra/activ_nvra.php\">national motor voter law</a> which permits a person to register to vote when he or she applies for a driving license. Here's how it works: Say you move from Provincetown on Cape Cod to Boston and opt to change your address online. Most people forget or don't know that they must go in person to a <a href=\"http://www.mass.gov/rmv/express/index.htm\">state registry of motor vehicles</a> office and fill out another form so that the changes get forwarded to the new city or town. </p> <p>Miss this step and once again you're out of luck at the friendly neighbourhood polling place. \"We will no doubt have many people because they have relocated for whatever reason looking to try to vote and not be on the rolls,\" said Massachusetts secretary of state William Galvin, the Bay State's <a href=\"http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/\">top election official</a>.</p> <p>To cut down on people needing provisional ballots, Deval Patrick, the governor of Massachusetts, today signed into law a change that would allow some voters who failed to re-register within 18 months of moving to go back to their old neighbourhoods to vote in the presidential and state races only. But local election officials fear that the move will create more problems than it solves, since poll workers won't have enough time to figure out how the process should work.<br> Worse still, when people vote provisionally, most fail to check the status of their ballot after the election. If the ballot wasn't counted, the person never finds out and, consequently, doesn't take the necessary steps to correct the error. So the cycle can start all over again in the next election, likely creating a permanent sub-class of voters who use provisional ballots, but whose votes never count. About three million people turned out for the <a href=\"http://elections.gmu.edu/Turnout_2004G.html\">2004 presidential election in Massachusetts</a>. A little more than 10,000 provisional votes were cast. Only about 2,300 were validated. Yet if election officials in true-blue Massachusetts, where elections run smoothly for the most part, are seizing up over the prospect of dealing with provisional voting while coping with a turnout of epic proportions, imagine the nightmares of officials in states with less-than-stellar track records like Florida or Ohio, where the outcome of the presidential race is not at all assured.<br> Add in a shortage of poll workers and the likelihood that provisional voting will muck things up multiplies, especially in locales with tight races. Just last week, federal election officials announced the <a href=\"http://www.eac.gov/News/press/preparing-for-historic-voter-turnout-eac-renews-call-for-poll-workers/base_view\">need for some two million volunteer poll workers nationwide</a>. \"I hope that election officials in every state are ready for this,\" said former presidential candidate and Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis, now a political science professor at <a href=\"http://www.northeastern.edu/neuhome/index.php\">Northeastern University</a>.<br> Not everyone is sweating bullets. Eight states allow residents to register and vote on election day: Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Exempt from the HAVA provisional voting requirements, this cohort also posts some of the highest voter-turnout numbers in the country. (North Dakota doesn't have statewide registration, while North Carolina residents can vote anywhere from three to 19 days before the election.) </p> <p>This year, 24 states including Massachusetts tried and failed to pass comparable laws. Diane Jeffery, president of the <a href=\"http://www.lwvma.org/\">League of Women Voters of Massachusetts</a>, believes that provisional voting is necessary to prevent some people from being denied the right to vote. But she believes there is a better way. \"I would rather see election day registration than have to go through this kind of process,\" she said.<br> If provisional voting contributes to chaos this time around, count on lawmakers and civic leaders in states across the country to embrace election day registration and move to toss a well-meaning but frustrating procedure into the dustbin of history.</p>",
  "<p>Being on the road, you get a newspaper at your hotel room door every morning. Yesterday, I was reading USA Today, and they have a fascinating story about Barack Obama's fundraising appeal even to executives in some industries who four years ago <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-10-27-prez-money_N.htm?csp=Daily%20briefing\">donated to the Bush campaign rather to John Kerry</a>. This story explains why John McCain is struggling even with traditional Republicans in big business. </p> <p>Occasionally, I come across a quote that sums up the state of the race so succinctly that it just stands out. Four years ago, it was when my father said that he didn't want Bush to win but couldn't bring himself to vote for John Kerry. Even Democrats I've spoken to on this trip talk about how John Kerry's campaign was ineffectual and the candidate uninspiring. </p> <p>Folks in the UK always ask me how Americans could vote for Bush. There's your answer. You may not agree with it, but to put it bluntly, John Kerry sucked as a candidate. I'm sure that you've had Labour candidates that you had to force yourself to vote for even if the thought of voting for a Conservative made you ill. Democrats didn't vote for John Kerry. They voted against George Bush, and the ABB (Anybody but Bush) crowd wasn't big enough to win that election. If the election would have been held even six months later, it might have been. </p> <p>But let's return to 2008. In this election, this story really explains the uphill battle that McCain is fighting in the closing days of this election, a defensive battle to win back traditional Republican voters, even on issues such as taxes. </p> <p>They interviewed Bob Clark, the CEO of Clayco, a large real estate development firm in St Louis. Clark raised thousands of dollars for George Bush in 2000 but has raised half a million dollars for Obama in this election. They also spoke to Victor Hammel, the CEO of a pest-control company in Pennsylvania, another key swing state. The killer quotes? </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Barack is definitely more liberal than I am,\" Clark said. \"But I'm willing to compromise on some of those issues for what I think is the greater good.\"</p> <p>Hammel said, \"I would rather pay a little higher tax on a higher profit than a lower tax rate on lower profits.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This shows you the shift in this election from four years ago. If John McCain can't win on taxes with CEOs, then he's running out of arguments that will sway voters with less than a week to go from the election.</p>",
  "<p>A new presidential administration comes with quite a long to-do list. You have to write lots of new jokes for late-night TV shows, you have to immediately start printing bumper stickers abdicating responsibility for the new president-elect (ie: \"Don't blame me, I voted for ______!\"), and of course, you have to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/26/AR2008102602505.html\">stock up on your guns</a>.</p> <p>Wait. What? </p> <p>Apparently, it's true. In this wondrously bad economy, one industry is experiencing a surge in business. Gun sales are <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27393833/\">up 8% to 10% this year</a> and according to the gun buyers themselves, this is due to one of two fear-laden factors. </p> <p>First, neither presidential candidate instills total confidence in the heart of the gun owner when it comes to preserving their interpretation of the second amendment. <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/barack_obama_gun_control.htm\">Senator Obama</a> has said that though he supports an individual's right to bear arms, he also believes in \"common-sense safety measures\". In the past, this has meant that he endorsed an Illinois handgun ban, co-sponsored a bill to limit gun purchases to one per month and he is in favour of banning semi-automatics, among other precautions. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/domestic/john_mccain_gun_control.htm\">Senator McCain</a> has a vastly different relationship with guns and gun control. He voted for prohibiting lawsuits against gun manufacturers and he voted against the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Handgun_Violence_Prevention_Act\">Brady act</a>. McCain also voted to maintain current laws allowing guns to be sold without trigger locks. But his potential presence in office does not ameliorate the concerns of gun owners, who are disturbed by his previous tendencies towards a modicum of gun control (i.e. he has voted for requiring background checks on individuals purchasing guns at a gun show). So while McCain is certainly more gun-friendly than his opponent, he's definitely not the golden child of gun ownership.</p> <p>Obviously, and without further discourse, that title would fall to <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2199140/\">good old shoot 'em from the chopper</a> Sarah Palin.</p> <p>Second, the downward spiral of the economy has instilled fear into the heart of most Americans. Many gun owners believe that a surplus of weaponry and ammunition will protect them from the consequences of unhappy times. Anticipating an increase in crime and a decrease in availability of firearms and accessories in the new administration, people are endeavouring to protect themselves through the mobilisation of their second amendment rights.</p> <p>This is, of course, speaking in generalities. Not all gun owners plan on voting for McCain, despite the NRA's very <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/09/nra-endorses-mccain-palin-ticket/\">prominent endorsement</a> of the Republican candidate. The organisation called Senator Obama the most anti-gun would-be president in history. Those voters going against the grain in the microcosm of gun enthusiasts cite economic and health care concerns as more worrisome than the stability of their right to bear arms. Of course, they're making sure they own plenty of weapons now so that their collection can be grandfathered in when times change. </p> <p>This increase in gun sales is not a new trend for the US. Purchases jumped in 1994 after President Clinton advocated for a ban on semi-automatic rifles. Sales spiked after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/16/virginiatech.usgunviolence\">April 2007's killings</a> on the Virginia Tech campus. Gun ownership went up in 2006 when the housing bubble first popped in certain regions of the country, and continued to rise after every market dive. Despite the foreclosures left and right, unsteady gas prices and the staggering cost of groceries, a good percentage of Americans today are making room in the budget for new guns, as they seem to believe this will protect them from the imminent collapse of the economy and social justice.</p> <p>I suppose people cope with fear in a lot of different ways. What is alarming about this particular coping mechanism is that unlike biting one's nails, grinding one's teeth or hitting the cookie dough pretty hard, this particular habit has the potential to dramatically affect others well-being and perception of safety. </p> <p>So what say, candidates? How do you plan on addressing an increasingly divided, increasingly panicked population that is continuously arming itself at an unprecedented rate? Let me know when you have an answer. I'll be over here, head first in the cookie dough.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> threw up his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/florida\">Florida</a> fire wall today: a million Cuban Americans who see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> as a combination of Fidel Castro, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and any other Latin leader who ever nationalised a business.</p> <p>In the streets of Miami's Little Havana, which McCain visited today, there was one word for the kind of change promised by Obama.</p> <p>\"Comunismo,\" said Michael Garcia, 30, the son of Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9s who works at his family-owned accounting business.</p> <p>\"I shouldn't have to pay more taxes because I work harder than other<br>people,\" he said. \"The things that Obama say scare me because that's<br>everything that Fidel said. These things are associated in my mind with<br>going down the path to communism.\"</p> <p>McCain, who is fighting to hang on to the pivotal state, has tried for two weeks to tap into fears that Obama would raise taxes for business owners, using the story of Joe the Plumber, the Ohio man who confronted the Democrat about his plan to \"spread the wealth around\".</p> <p>But nowhere perhaps has McCain found a more willing audience for his story about Joe the Plumber than south Florida, the heartland of Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9s - where he is known locally as \"Pepe el plomero\".</p> <p>Cuban support is crucial to McCain if he is to hold Florida in Tuesday's elections, and block Obama from winning the White House.</p> <p>Here, in the traditional Republican enclave of Little Havana, even the<br>faintest whiff of socialism revives memories of exile from Castro, a<br>psychology McCain played on today.</p> <p>\"Senator Obama is running to be redistributionist-in-chief. I'm running to be commander-in-chief,\" he told a crowd of a few hundred at a local lumber yard. \"Senator Obama is running to spread the wealth. I'm running to create more wealth. Senator Obama is running to punish the successful. I'm running to make everyone successful.\"</p> <p>In the small tidy homes of Little Havana, lawn campaign signs warn that an Obama presidency would be the first step to communism. Spanish language radio shows berate Obama for saying he would negotiate with Castro, Ch\u00e1vez and Iran's Mahmoud Ahmedinejad.</p> <p>Many of the McCain supporters in the lumber yard today see Obama as practically a clone of Castro.</p> <p>\"Obama is saying 100% the same things that Castro was saying before 1959,\" said Nerty Piscola who left Cuba as a teenager in 1969. \"It sounds good. Many people want to be equal, but the result is that everyone is equal and everyone is poor. We don't want to go through the same experience again.\"</p> <p>The fears run even deeper among those who were adults at the time of the revolution. \"If Obama takes power, you are going to see all the people going to the fields to cut sugar cane,\" said Lazaro de Jesus, a sign painter.</p> <p>Cuban Americans, because of their numbers and their history of voting<br>Republican, have for years been the power brokers in Florida. </p> <p>In recent years, they have been reinforced in their anti-socialist, anti-Democratic views by a new wave of Spanish-speaking exiles from Venezuela. At least 80,000 have settled in Florida since Ch\u00e1vez came to power in 2000.</p> <p>Lorraine Thomas, a businesswoman who left Venezuela in 2002, argues that an Obama White House would destroy the very essence of America.</p> <p>\"If Obama wins, I think he is going to take half of the American dream<br>away,\" she said. \"You are going to come here and you are going to get taxed a lot of money and you are going to give money to people that don't work and are lazy.\"</p> <p>The Cuban vote is crucial if McCain is to counter the surge of support for<br>Obama in south Florida.</p> <p>The three counties surrounding Miami are the Democratic heartland of<br>Florida. The Obama camp's strategy for Florida depends on beating McCain by a 600,000-vote margin to take the entire state.</p> <p>They hope to get a third of their supporters to take part in early voting, a goal made easier today after Florida's Republican governor Charlie Crist ordered polling stations to stay open longer. Voters had been waiting in line for three hours at some polling stations.</p> <p>The Obama camp also says it has won over a substantial share of younger Cubans, those who were born in this country and strongly identify with domestic American issues.</p> <p>McCain supporters acknowledge the shift and exit polls of early voting suggest Cuban Americans under the age of 30 are defecting from the Republicans.</p> <p>The older generation may be losing its grip. \"I think a lot of the older<br>Cubans are - sorry to say - dying off, and a lot of the people coming over from the island that have only been here about 10 years tend to vote more Democratic than Republic,\" said Carmen Elliott, who was a toddler when her family left Cuba in 1962. </p> <p>\"I don't vote the way my parents do,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>Senior Republicans are planning to meet at a rural retreat in Virginia within days of the election to discuss how to rebuild a party they expect to be badly beaten in the White House and congressional races.</p> <p>News of the meeting emerged as a poll in Arizona indicated that John McCain could suffer the embarrassing loss of his home state. The poll put McCain on 46% and Barack Obama on 44%, indicating the Republicans are struggling to hold on in their traditional heartlands.</p> <p>Details of next week's post-election meeting, to be attended by state chairmen and prominent activists from the conservative wing of the party, are being kept secret for fear of being seen to preempt the outcome of the presidential contest.</p> <p>It is intended to look at who should take over chairmanship of the party, whether the party needs to switch to the right, and to make plans for the next presidential election.</p> <p>Sarah Palin, John McCain's running mate, though not present, will be a central figure in discussions about the party's future.</p> <p>\"It is about what direction the party takes, the proverbial struggle for the soul of the party,\" Norm Ornstein, an analyst at the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute, the home of the neo-conservatives, said today.</p> <p>\"There will be a million post-mortems and finger-pointing. What is unusual is that the finger-pointing has begun before the campaign is ended.\"</p> <p>One of the biggest post-mortems, if McCain loses, is scheduled for the week after the election, the Republican governors' annual meeting in Miami. Sessions planned include one looking back on the election titled, An in-depth evaluation of the 2008 election cycle.</p> <p>Another session is titled, Looking towards the future: the Grand Ole Party in transition. There is also a section on the \"rising stars of the party\".</p> <p>One of the concerns of the party is that, if the polls prove accurate, the Democrats are poised to make huge advances into its traditional base in the south and in western states such as Colorado. With New York and the north-east and almost all of the West Coast primarily in Democratic hands, the question is where to rebuild their base.</p> <p>The other problem is that the party is short of political \"stars\" in contrast with the Democrats, apart from Palin. The hunt for new potential leaders could shift to the younger generation, including figures such as Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana.</p> <p>The Virginia meeting, to avoid accusations of being premature, is to go ahead whether McCain wins or loses. If he were to win, the discussion would turn to how conservatives can influence the new administration.</p> <p>On the agenda for the meeting, at the home of a prominent Republican, are economic, foreign and social policy. The aim is to build a new grassroots organisation, comparable to Republican efforts after Jimmy Carter won the White House for the Democrats in 1976, and a similar rebuilding by the Democrats after a wipe-out in the 1994 congressional race.</p> <p>An unnamed source involved in the planning told the Politico website, which first disclosed news of the Virginia meeting, said: \"This is going on if McCain wins, loses or has a recount - we're not planning for the loss of John McCain.\"</p> <p>The source blamed the party's decline on betrayal of conservative principles by President George Bush and Republican leaders in Congress.</p> <p>\"There's a sense that the Republican party is broken, but the conservative movement is not.\"</p> <p>Ornstein said he had heard the buzz about the Virginia meeting for some time and had spoken to some of those involved. The participants were mainly state chairman and political activists and he did not anticipate elected representatives taking part.</p> <p>\"There are a bunch of people who are planning, assuming that McCain loses, to try to shape the future of the Republican party. You are going to get a little bit of a struggle,\" Ornstein said. There will be those who argue that the party lost because it strayed from the conservative path while others will argue that the party lost the middle ground, he said.</p> <p>At the governor's conference, from November 12 to 14, speakers lined up include Charlie Crist, the governor of Florida, and a host of southern governors, as well as retired general Tommy Franks, the right-wing columnist Bill Kristol and the pollster, Frank Luntz.</p> <p>Another post-election meeting is one to be hosted by the South Carolina Republican chairman, Katon Dawson, who has invited state party leaders and others to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to \"\"discuss the lessons learned from the 2008 campaign, what we can do better and what it will take to win in 2010\", the congressional mid-terms will be held. Dawson is among those seeking to become the next party chairman.</p>",

  "<p>It's the same story wherever we go. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/29/obama-campaign-volunteers\">Barack Obama is dominating the ground game</a> and has out organised the McCain campaign in almost every state, even states that were reliably Republican. In the critical swing state of Missouri, I spoke to David Drebes, who blogs at <a href=\"http://www.archcitychronicle.com/\">Arch City Chronicle</a> in St Louis and writes for the St Louis Business Journal and also produces a letter for lobbyists in the state. When I asked about Obama's oganisation, he said one word: \"Unbelievable\".</p> <p>\"There are people with clipboards (for the Obama campaign) everywhere,\" he said. </p> <p>And the Republican Party is worried. Last month, he spoke to a Republican lobbyist. \"He thought (Obama's organisation) was more impressive than what they've done, and they were pretty proud\" of their get out the vote efforts, David said.</p> <p>To illustrate this, he was talking to someone in rural <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_County,_Missouri\">Monroe County</a> in the northeast part of the state, an area settled by Southern migrants, often referred to as Little Dixie. In this overwhelmingly white county, David said that this person ran into people going door-to-door canvassing for Obama on horseback.</p> <p>Missouri is a toss-up state, with <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/mo/missouri_mccain_vs_obama-545.html\">RealClearPolitics.com showing a statistically insignificant 0.6% advantage for Obama</a>. David said that politically people refer to Missouri as a \"miniature map of the country\". On the 'coasts' of this United States in miniature are two huge cities, St Louis and Kansas City, which are more urban, more liberal and, therefore, more Democratic. Apart from university towns like Columbia, the rest of the state in between those two cities is rural and reliably Republican. \"When you factor that all together, you've got a toss up state\", David said.</p> <p>On the other 'coast' of Missouri in Kansas City, I spoke to Eric Rogers, who writes <a href=\"http://blogkc.com/\">blogKC.com</a>. He's seeing the same thing as David. \"Barack Obama has dozens of field offices all over the state. He has opened offices in small towns that have probably never seen a Democratic field office before.\"</p> <p>Both candidates are fighting hard for the state with dueling appearances, but the strategies and turnout at their events have been very different, as <a href=\"http://blogkc.com/archives/2008/10/turnout-at-recent-presidential-visits-in-missouri/\">Eric blogged recently</a>. Obama recently held huge public rallies in Kansas City where 75,000 people are estimated to have turned out and St Louis where the crowd was even larger, an estimated 100,000. McCain held much smaller invitation only or ticketed events with only a few thousand people.</p> <p>But Eric is slightly sceptical about the ability of the Obama machine to win Missouri. Four years ago, he volunteered for the John Kerry campaign. They told volunteers how they were going to build a grassroots organisation that would rival Republicans' efforts, just as the Obama campaign has promised. But George Bush won the state by a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/elections/2004/mo/\">comfortable 53%-46% margin</a>.</p> <p>There are signs that the Obama campaign is making good on its promise to out organise the Republicans, he said, but added, \"it will be interesting to see if this enough\".</p> <p><strong>No rallying point for social conservatives</strong></p> <p>There were other factors four years ago that might have contributed to George Bush's victory. Missouri was one of the states where an anti-gay marriage amendment rallied social conservatives. David said in that election he saw something that he'd never seen before. Usually, people vote for president and they cast fewer votes on more minor candidates and 'down-ballot' issues.</p> <p>\"There were certain places in the state where more votes cast on that constitutional amendment than there were for top of the ticket (for president),\" he said.</p> <p>There isn't a ballot initiative with the same resonance for social conservatives this year, with the possible exception of an \"English-only\" amendment. It would require all government meetings to be conducted in English. It's <a href=\"http://www.stjoenews.net/news/2008/sep/24/english-only-amendment-sparks-heated-debate/?local\">sparked some controversy</a> in areas such as St Joseph where there is a large Latino population. But as with the rest of the country, the economy has pushed everything else off the agenda, David said.</p> <p>\"It's faded into irrelevance. No one seems to be talking about it all. There has been no organised campaign. No money has been put forward to it. People seem to have forgotten about in the face of issues like the economy,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The sentiment can be expressed in any number of ways: 'lost the plot', 'jumped the shark', or even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2008/jun/13/indysfridgeblastsfonzsshar\">'nuked the fridge'</a>. But no matter how it's phrased, I can't keep it inside any longer. This presidential election has become a meaningless heap of tired narratives and manufactured scandals.</p> <p>I'm under no illusion that my feelings are shared by my colleagues in journalism or by my fellow American voters. After 631 days of a campaign that began with more than a dozen viable candidates, the public still appears insatiably hungry for <em>one more story</em> on Obama's two-year <a href=\"http://foro.univision.com/univision/board/message?board.id=puertorico&amp;message.id=157201\">stint as a backbench senator</a> or McCain's fixation on <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/us/politics/13mccain.html?partner=rssnyt\">the honour of wartime service</a>. The tales are compelling, to be sure, and after eight years of faux-country-boy George Bush, one is hard-pressed to begrudge the nation a little romance about the biographies of the presidential finalists.</p> <p>Yet politics, even in the age of limitless online dialog, remains a zero-sum game. Every minute of the news cycle spent on one plotline is a minute lost to alternative topics \u2013 or, in this case, every minute spent treating Obama, McCain, Sarah Palin and Joe the Plumber like characters on a long-running TV show is a minute lost to righting our wrecked financial ship or refining our relations with our neighbours.</p> <p>The Project for Excellence in Journalism, run by the non-partisan Pew centre, has churned out stunning though little-noticed data on the nation's obsession with irrelevant campaign narratives. For the <a href=\"http://journalism.org/node/13391\">week that ended Sunday</a>, the candidates' responses to the still-raging credit crisis accounted for only 2% of total election coverage. Obama's visit to his ailing grandmother in Hawaii got double that amount of attention.</p> <p>Is it nice that Obama cares enough to be by his beloved Toot's bedside? Sure. But why do I know his grandmother's nickname and not how he would regulate credit default swaps to prevent another Wall Street implosion? There's something wrong with this picture. </p> <p>Let's not even talk about ol' Joe the workin' man, as <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/10/mccain_ad_compa.html\">McCain might call him</a>, who dominated 8% of the campaign coverage <a href=\"http://journalism.org/node/13283\">during a week this month</a> when healthcare and Iraq each got less than 1%.</p> <p>Turning the \"most important election of our lifetime\" (if 23,700 Google hits for the term is any guide) into a procession of offbeat personalities rivalling the cast of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306414/\">The Wire</a> is no mean feat. We've distracted ourselves from the devolving war in Afghanistan as well as the sub-prime mess by crafting a quasi-realistic PoliticsWorld to frolic in, where Bill Ayers, Mike Wooten, Vicki Iseman and Rev. Jeremiah Wright enjoy a brief reign of relevance before drifting offstage. It's been a strange but effective form of self-medication for a nation adrift.</p> <p>On that note, I'm surprised to say I miss that Hillary Clinton character. She still makes guest appearances on PoliticsWorld, but she made for a compelling heroine/villainess hybrid during her time in the opening credits, a regular <a href=\"http://www.film.com/features/story/tv-addict-top-ten-brenda/22774949\">Brenda Walsh of Washington</a>. </p> <p>In all seriousness, no one expected the election to be a marathon of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/opinion/28tue1.html?hp\">detailed comparisons</a> between McCain's tax-credit-based healthcare plan and Obama's mandate for employer-based coverage. And the candidates are as much to blame as the media for this year's recycled squabbles \u2013 particularly McCain aides, who seem to nurse a fixation on Wright, Ayers and other shadowy personae in the House of Obama.</p> <p>But there could have been an election that didn't hinge so completely on a dumbed-down distillation of two stereotypes. It's <a href=\"http://politicalmomsunite.blogspot.com/2008/10/joe-cool-vs-yosemite-sam-snl-sum-up-of.html\">Joe Cool v Yosemite Sam</a>!

The one match-up we still haven't seen is between two candid, pander-free prescriptions for pulling America back from the abyss. </p> <p>It's a shame, too, because I know I'd watch that TV show. But, to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A132-2004Dec14.html\">paraphrase a not-so-great man</a>, you go to the polls with the campaign storyline you have, not the one you might wish to have.

  "<p>A Nicolas Sarkozy voodoo doll that became a bestselling cult classic when the president tried to have it banned is to remain on sale after a French court threw out the case today.</p> <p>A judge ruled that Nicolas Sarkozy: The Voodoo Manual, which features a doll, a set of pins and a book explaining how to put the evil eye on the president, fell within the boundaries of \"free expression\" and the \"right to humour\".</p> <p>The president's lawyer had argued that, like any French person, Sarkozy owned the right to his own image, which was violated by the sale of the doll.</p> <p>The highly litigious president was ridiculed by his critics for launching the legal action - his sixth lawsuit since his election - and the doll instantly became a must-have.</p> <p>The Socialist S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, who was the subject of a similar voodoo doll but didn't sue, hailed the verdict as a victory for the freedom to \"caricature the world's most powerful\".

  "<p><strong>USHERING IN THE YEAR AD48</strong></p> <p>Buying birthday presents for even the closest of relatives can be a chore, but honestly - what does one give a middle-aged man who already has <a href=\"http://www.iglesiamaradoniana.com.ar/\">his own church</a>? A few years back Diego Maradona might have been hoping for a bucket of jazz salt and a doughnut, but he's a clean-living fella these days, so Argentine Football Association (AFA) president Julio Grondona knew what had to be done. The only way to truly ensure Maradona enjoys his 48th birthday tomorrow would be to offer him the Argentina manager's job.</p> <p>\"As I was going to the meeting [with Grondona], I thought it was some kind of hidden camera [show],\" chortled Maradona today, unwittingly exposing the falling standards in Argentine reality TV. The AFA insisted that the appointment, which follows Alfio Basile's resignation earlier this month, won't be made official until next Tuesday, but such formalities weren't going to stop Maradona talking up his new role. \"My job will be watching the players and picking up the ones who are in the best form,\" he continued, silencing the doubters who had argued six months in charge of Deportivo Mandiyu and Racing Club in the mid-90s was insufficient preparation for the role.</p> <p>Maradona's job won't be easy, mind - Argentina have won just one of their last seven World Cup qualifiers. \"We must make the players understand that our shirt is the most important thing, that they cannot exchange money for glory,\" parped the man who recently charged $25,000 - plus $2,000 in expenses - for a 30-minute appearance at a fundraiser for Chile's struggling footballers' union.</p> <p>Thankfully he won't have to do it alone. Pedro Troglio is set to be named as Maradona's assistant, while Carlos Bilardo is expected to become the national side's technical director. Grondona explained in a radio interview that the team may be run more by committee than by Maradona alone, saying \"one man alone can't command, in any job\". Which is probably pretty much the same thing Maradona was trying to get across when he informed reporters: \"I will form the team.\" Next year Grondona might be better off just getting him a card.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Can Maradona bring the glory days back to Argentine football? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2008/oct/29/argentina\">Yes.

A big curled-up-in-the-foetal-position-under-a-warm-duvet bah!</p> <p>The best story English football can come up with today - and you'll probably not be particularly interested in this - is the news that Sir Alex Ferguson has given his public endorsement to Lindsay Roy, the New Labour goon who will lose the upcoming by-election in Glenrothes. \"Labour under Gordon Brown has handled the situation well and deserves support at this difficult time,\" said Ferguson, \"and if you don't vote for him I will throw a tea urn at you. Do you want some?\" Ferguson giving his backing to New Labour shouldn't really qualify as news, of course, given he abandoned any claim to be a socialist the day he chose to stay at Old Trafford and tacitly support the regime of venture capitalists hell-bent on pricing the common fan out of the ground. But as we said, it's a slow news day, and we're not that fussy.</p> <p>Elsewhere, there's a bit of snow-melting air being blasted by the FA ahead of tonight's big do at the Emirates Stadium, where 'Arry Redknapp is holding a car-boot sale. A whopping total of five people from 60,064 were arrested at the venue's last event against Everton, when trouble between fans escalated to such a degree that, according to the Met, the away fans couldn't muster the strength to throw their missiles out of their own section. That's led to a scaremongering FA suit, perhaps mindful that Halloween is just around the corner, deciding to pour gallons of fuel where there is no fire, then flicking his Zippo open with a flourish.</p> <p>\"We have seen SOME INCIDENTS in the last two weeks which are COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE,\" he BLASTED. \"Our message to ANY FANS PLANNING ON CAUSING TROUBLE is that they will be DEALT WITH IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE WAY.\" Now the Fiver is simple folk, but perhaps the best message to send to fans would carefully avoid blowing up the actions of a tiny minority of clowns into a huge issue. Of course that would mean we'd have absolutely nothing to write about in times like these - so a win-win situation for everyone, then.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Follow <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/29/premierleague-arsenal\">tonight's north Lah'n derby</a> - which Arsenal will win 2-1 - with Scott Murray's minute-by-minute report from 7.45pm or so.</p> <p>*********************</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Like an eagle with a prediliction for Macedonian strikers, Chelsea are preparing to swoop for Lazio's Goran Pandev.</p> <p>Darren Bent likes to train wearing nothing but a string vest and the sort of shorts last seen in the early 80s, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/29/sunderland-stokecity\">which explains why</a> he's a target for Sunderland.</p> <p>And Blackeye Rovers' Zurab Khizanishvili wants to become Bad Boys Inc's Zurab Khizanishvili.</p> <p>*********************</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>A friendly match between MSPs and Scottish hacks ended in farce when a mass brawl forced its abandonment.

  "<p>A human rights activist swept to power today in the first democratic presidential polls in the Maldives, ousting from office the man who once imprisoned him and prompting jubilant scenes on the streets of the Indian Ocean island's capital Male.</p> <p>Mohamed 'Anni' Nasheed, a former Amnesty International prisoner of conscience who founded the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) in 2003, secured 54 per cent of the vote \u2013 beating Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, Asia's longest serving leader, in the run-off election.</p> <p>In a bitter campaign marked by personal animosity, Nasheed - a Sunni Muslim \u2013 was said to be spreading Christianity in the Islamic nation via his links with Britain's Conservative party. However his message of change coupled with a call for social and economic liberalism lifted him above the fray.</p> <p>The results mark the end of the three-decade rule of 71-year-old Maldivian strongman, Gayoom, who won the last six elections, never having before faced an opponent. Gayoom has had Nasheed thrown into jail several times over the last six years. </p> <p>Following the results, Gayoom told the nation in a live concession speech that he fully supported Nasheed:</p> <p>\"I accept the results of the ... run-off election and I respectfully congratulate Mr. Mohamed Nasheed and his party.\"</p> <p>Thousands of MDP supporters flocked to Mal\u00e9, waving yellow flags while others rejoiced at the beachfront promenade where they had camped for days in support of the opposition. Nasheed, who had emerged as a unity candidate for the five opposition parties, said he wanted a \"peaceful transition. I want my supporters to be calm.\"</p> <p>The archipelago of 300,000 people on 1,196 islands will officially get its new president on November 11, exactly 30 years after the Gayoom \"sultanate\" began. Until 2004, opposition parties were banned and it was not until violent riots broke out in August 2005, protesting Nasheed's arrest that month, that the country was set on the road to democracy.</p> <p>Autocracy did bring wealth to the string of islands. President Gayoom single-handedly built the modern Maldivian economy that rests on high-end tourism, with resorts overlooking white sand beaches and crystal clear waters where hotels charge thousands of pounds a night.</p> <p>Its per capital income of $2,200 (just under \u00a31,350) made the Maldives the wealthiest country in South Asia. </p> <p>But the figures masked huge inequalities, rampant drug abuse and corruption amid crumbling public infrastructure. \"People have seen a tiny group of people get very, very rich in the last thirty years. Meanwhile we have no communications between our islands. Our health system is in a bad way,\" said Naseem Mohamed, a spokesman for the MDP.</p> <p>\"People wanted a change from all this\". Mr Mohamed said that, although most people in the Maldives practised a relaxed form of Islam, there was an unspoken concern about the \"explosive mix of poverty and terrorism\". He said that social discord led to religious extremism, resulting in a bomb in a tourist spot last year: </p> <p>\"With our economy so dependent on tourism and the economic slowdown there is a concern the situation could turn volatile.\" </p> <p>Analysts say that the real issue for the Maldives was the period of political uncertainty before elections to the new 74-member parliament next March. The parliament has considerable powers \u2013 including the right to block presidential cabinet appointments.</p> <p>\"It is what people like Nasheed wanted\u2026 a check on presidential power. But there needs to be time to allow the politics to stabilise after Gayoom's one-man show. The opposition has everybody from the democrats to the conservative Islamic parties. It'll be hard to keep them together,\" said P Sahadevan, professor of South Asian studies at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.</p> <h2>Profile - the victor</h2> <p>Known throughout the Maldives by his nickname, Anni, Mohamed Nasheed founded the Maldives Democratic Party in 2003 while in exile in Sri Lanka and Britain. He took his inspiration from India's Gandhi, preaching non-violence as the only route to freedom.</p> <p>He was acutely aware that his country would explode without the safety valve of democracy. Although he graduated from Liverpool with a degree in maritime engineering, Anni was best known as a fiery journalist \u2013 and quickly ran foul of the authorities. Imprisoned in the 1990s for giving an interview to the international media, Mr Nasheed spent 18 months in solitary confinement, tortured at the hands of security services. He was deprived of sleep and water, fed food with crushed glass and still has a limp from being chained to a chair outside for 12 days. He became an Amnesty Prisoner of Conscience in 1997.</p> <p>But he never lost hope in democracy. After being elected to parliament in 1999, he lost his seat in 2001 after he was prosecuted on trumped-up charges of stealing. A thorn in the side of President Gayoom, Anni has spent a total of six years either in jail or work camps. He left the Maldives in 2003 and returned in April 2005 but was arrested again the following August, sparking off civil unrest. </p> <p>By 2004, the tide was turning in the Maldives \u2013 and Anni was winning the battle of ideas. In response the government declared a state of emergency. He finally managed to register the MDP in the Maldives in June 2005.</p>",
  "<p>From TMZ, those urchin-scavengers on the twin slagheaps of celebrity and infamy, we are favoured with the full, unexpurgated script of Larry Flynt's smash-and-grab overnight political porno satire <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2008/10/08/get-a-load-of-this-whos-nailin-palin-script-1/\">Who's Nailin' Paylin?</a><br> Predictably the script's literary values are close to nil, and its political jabs, while sometimes close to the bone, are often closer to infantile, and it elicited exactly the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/feature/2008/10/20/palin_porn/index.html\">response</a> you'd expect from the blas\u00e9 know-it-alls over at Salon. They weren't impressed by three-way sex scenes between versions of Sarah Palin (porn star Lisa Ann), Hillary Clinton (feminist activist, democratic socialist and all-round very nice lady Nina Hartley) and Condi Rice, or between Todd Palin and one of Sarah's interns. Or by the ridiculous dialogue: \"Drill, baby, drill!\"; \"I'm melting the North Pole!\"; \"I'm speaking in tongues!\" et cetera.</p> <p>But to Flynt and to Hustler magazine's core audience of Joe the Plumber types, military servicemen stuck in Iraq and penitentiary inmates mired in America's correctional gulag, none of this matters. Hell, why not get a little political satire with your bump-n-grind? I bet they like this though, from the movie's Condi figure to Palin: \"You say 'you betcha' one more time and I'm gonna bitch-slap those glasses right off your face.\" Or Condi's shameful secret: \"As soon as Bush is out of office, there might be a videotape discovered of someone who looks a lot like me doing things to some guys who look a lot like Cheney, Rove, Wolfowitz and Chuck Norris.\" It's not as though American pornography is anything more than asleep-in-school blue-collar fantasy writ large and lurid - and who needs homework when you've got a hard-on?</p> <p>Flynt knows this. Even before he was shot and paralysed by a racist right-wing maniac outside a Georgia courthouse in 1978, Flynt was a political gadfly with enough money to indulge his iron whims and to make life unpleasant for his enemies and tormentors, particularly political ones. He ran for president in 1976, leaving a bright, livid stain across the year of the bicentennial, having originally built his fortune on full-frontal nude photos of Jackie Onassis. And in 1998 he came into possession of compromising information that led directly to the resignation of newly elected - and adulterous - Republican House speaker Bob Livingston before he'd even been sworn into office. Not bad for a hillbilly zillionaire with a gold-plated wheelchair and a mechanical pump in his penis to help him acheive faux-tumescence.</p> <p>And if you think there's little political content to Who's Nailin' Paylin? whatsoever, well, you may be right, but there is an indirect connection between Palin, Flynt and McCain that suggests that, deep in the background, Flynt is settling another one of his age-old scores, this time with a dead man (Flynt, who grew up in the land of the Hatfields and McCoys, never forgets a grudge.) You see, one of his earliest tormentors, back in the early 1970s when Flynt was a fledgling skin-trader in abstemious, uptight Cincinnati, Ohio, was none other than that foul blemish on McCain's own reputation, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Keating\">Charles Keating</a>. Keating was the kind of sanctimonious religious maniac who got all up in people's grills about their sexual peccadilloes, yet regarded personal wealth - particularly his own extremely ill-gotten personal wealth - as the only true index of godliness (and, of course, none of your goddamn business). He successfully dragged Flynt into court on several occasions.</p> <p>But later he was the man who essentially bribed McCain and four other prominent politicians to intervene in his favour when, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/1004633/\">infamously</a>, his Lincoln Savings and Loan was collapsing in the late 1980s, at catastrophic expense to the American taxpayer. McCain has always maintained that <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E7D9123CF932A15752C1A96F958260\">the drubbing he took over his Keating connection</a> was <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/choice2008/mccain/pow.html\">worse than his five years in Hanoi</a>. (Really, senator? Payments totalling $13,433, plus a bunch of free Caribbean family vacations, was worse than being a prisoner of war for five years? My, my, it certainly sounds arduous.) Flynt, who grew up in grinding Appalachian poverty, literally one holler over from coal miner's daughter Loretta Lynn, is not the kind of person to be impressed by a tantrum-flinging, self-dealing, third-generation rich-brat like John Sidney McCain III.</p> <p>Keating went to jail for his sins but, as the final where-are-they-now titlecard in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117318/\">The People Vs Larry Flynt</a> reminds us: \"He got off on a technicality.\" (He was played by James Cromwell, since better-known to us as Prince Philip in The Queen and George HW Bush in W, each as starchy as Keating.)</p> <p>Let me confess a personal interest in the dark doings of Flynt, who was my employer here in Los Angeles for a few years in the mid-90s. For about a year it was my privilege to write the (fictional) Hustler Letters Page (there's a real letters page, too, filled largely with the demented ravings and onanistic cris de coeur of incarcerated Americans), wherein I regaled my readers with tales of sexual braggadocio and some lowbrow comedy (\"The farmer's daughter, the cowhand and their adventures with a bovine inseminator\" was possibly my greatest hit - I'm going to hell for that one), and I made a killing reviewing porno movies for the Hustler Erotic Video Guide, alongside <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Kill\">Generation Kill author Evan Wright</a> and others.</p> <p>For all its slimy reputation, Larry Flynt Publications back then was the American International Pictures of American journalism. Owned by a classic Cormanesque tightwad, it was an excellent place for talented misfits to gain experience in magazine writing (and mostly on little-read non-porno titles) before moving on to less salacious precincts like, well, the Guardian. The mastheads of America's snootiest magazines and newspapers are dotted with the names of people you'd never believe once toiled alongside pornstars and hired cocksmen, debated whether \"pre-ejaculate\" contained a hyphen or an umlaut, and bowed long and low as Flynt was wheeled through in his chair by his matching, unsmiling black-and-white bodyguards.</p> <p>I harbour no illusions about the real Larry Flynt. He was a cheapskate boss peddling a lot of shoddy product, and he barely knew the names of employees who'd worked for him for years. But the media version of Flynt - that guy I do like, the unapologetic pain in the ass, the Cadillac redneck with a pink private jet and too much cash to ever give a shit about mere politicians. Long may he rub 'em up the wrong way!</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> today gave a rare policy speech, reciting Republican themes on energy independence in a late-hour bid to slow <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>'s momentum.</p> <p>The speech, which came late in the campaign season for a policy address, contained no new details. It was notable for Palin's tentative delivery, a marked contrast from her enthusiastic and energetic stump attacks on Obama several times a day.</p> <p>The speech came in a week in which McCain and Palin insiders have engaged in numerous rounds of recrimination in the news media, with one side blaming the other for the Republican ticket's inability to make significant gains in the polls in the final week of the campaign. Democrats say the speech may reflect discord within <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>'s camp - a teleprompter speech on energy is a safe use of the vice-presidential candidate, leaving her little opportunity for embarrassing gaffes or off-message remarks.</p> <p>Palin's talk before a Toledo, Ohio solar power manufacturer, may mark an early effort to position her for the 2012 presidential race, should she and McCain lose on Tuesday. Palin is governor of oil- and gas-rich Alaska, and she and the Republicans have sought to portray her as an expert on energy policy.</p> <p>Palin said that a McCain administration would boost domestic energy production and curtail the country's dependence on foreign oil. Those are both stated goals also of Democratic candidate Barack Obama.</p> <p>Departing numerous times from her prepared remarks, Palin spoke of taking on the \"good ol' boys\" of Alaskan energy politics - the Republican party old guard and the entrenched oil companies - and signing a pipeline deal without their support.</p> <p>Palin called for increased drilling of domestic oil supply, more nuclear and coal-fired energy capacity and development of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. She lambasted Obama and his vice-presidential nominee <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> for what she described as their reluctance to embrace those proposals. The Democrats have said they are open to expanded nuclear power and offshore drilling but only with appropriate environmental safeguards.</p> <p>Palin said that by refusing to back increased domestic production without qualification, the Democrats encourage environmentally unsafe production abroad.</p> <p>\"John McCain and I, we're determined to set this country firmly on a path toward energy independence,\" she said. \"America has the resources to achieve this vital goal. We certainly have the ingenuity. And John McCain and I, if we are elected, we will supply the political will to finally get this done.\"</p> <p>In a response released by the Obama campaign, Ohio's governor, Ted Strickland, criticised McCain's proposal to cut corporate income tax rates, which he said would benefit the companies who trade in middle eastern oil.</p> <p>\"In a bit of rare straight talk, Sarah Palin attacked her own running mate's record today by blaming our oil addiction on 30 years of failure' in Washington,\" Strickland said. \"John McCain was there for twenty-six of those years, during which he voted against alternative sources of energy and stood with oil industry lobbyists instead.\"</p>",
  "<p>John McCain is in danger of suffering an embarrassing loss in his home state of Arizona, according to a shock new poll released today.</p> <p>Democrats are seizing upon the results of today's Arizona State University poll, which found McCain on 46% and Obama on 44%, to depict the Republican as struggling to hang on to even his faithful backers.</p> <p>McCain held a 7% lead over Obama in Arizona just one month ago and a double-digit polling advantage earlier this year. Although the state McCain has represented in Congress for 26 years has slightly more registered Republican voters than Democrats, today's poll gave Obama a 20% lead with Arizona independent voters.</p> <p>Only three presidential candidates in US history have won an election while losing their state of residence. The loss of a home state became an especially harsh political prospect after Al Gore lost Tennessee in 2000, prompting public hand wringing over what might have been.</p> <p>Republican spokesman Jeff Sadosky defended the candidate's prospects in a statement to Politico.com. \"John McCain has never lost an election in Arizona, and this one will be no different, regardless of Obama's attempt to buy the election with millions of dollars in advertising,\" Sadosky said.</p> <p>Yet even McCain's fellow Arizona senator and close ally, Jon Kyl, offered a subtly dire prediction in a Sunday interview with one of the state's local newspapers.</p> <p>Asked whether Arizona, long known for its conservative ethos, could become a swing state as new residents change its demographics, Kyl foreshadowed a McCain defeat.<br> \"[U]nfortunately, I think John McCain might be added to that long list of Arizonans who ran for president but never were elected \u2026 Maybe we'll be able to say, Arizona's the only state where your child can't grow up to be president,\" Kyl told the Daily Star.</p> <p>Kyl closed by adding: \"So let's hope that doesn't happen.\" But the caveat did not stop Democrats from circulating the critical quote, which Kyl later claimed was taken out of context.</p> <p>Today's poll is a departure from the recent average of Arizona surveys, which finds McCain with a lead of more than 6%. Obama's advantage in his home state of Illinois has reached as high as 25%, according to the most recent polls.</p>",
  "<p>Big campaign donors typically come with deep pockets and influence. But in Illinois this election cycle, no one not running for office himself has given more to the nation's federal campaigns than Shi Sheng Hao, a virtual unknown in business and political circles.</p> <p>Before September 2007, Hao's name had never appeared in the 15-year-old federal database of campaign contributors. Since then, however, his donations have topped $120,000 - including $70,100 on a single June day to Republican presidential candidate John McCain.</p> <p>Over the same time frame, a network of Hao relatives has kicked in more. The take from this group over the last 13 months exceeds $269,000, most of it to McCain and the Republican National Committee, records show.</p> <p>Hao didn't register to vote at the north-west suburban address attached to his donations until October 2007, a month after he wrote his first political check, $25,000 to the RNC.</p> <p>The circumstances surrounding Hao's sudden and prolific political activism are curious and his whereabouts unclear. His name isn't listed on property records or the mailbox at the unassuming tract home listed on his donations. Hao lives \"overseas\", insisted a man who answered the door at the Roselle home recently. The man declined to identify himself.</p> <p>The story of Hao - whose varied roster of business associates appears to include a Taiwanese government investment arm as well as the mastermind of a decade-old Democratic fundraising scandal - is an eyebrow-raiser in the current election climate.</p> <p>Ethnic Chinese donors became an issue in the battle for the Democratic nomination last year because some didn't seem to live where they claimed on contribution records. Now, Republicans are raising questions about the authenticity of many small donations Democrat Barack Obama has received from abroad.</p> <p>Sheila Krumholz, the executive director of the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics, said the timing of the Hao-related contributions appeared troubling, though there could be a plausible explanation. \"Large contributions from people who have never given previously do generally provoke questions about who they are and what they're up to and most importantly, what they're looking for,\" said Krumholz, whose non-partisan group closely tracks political donations. \"The public needs to be concerned because there are fraudulent donations and persons use them to gain influence and access in Washington.\"</p> <p>McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said Hao was not a \"major donor\" and \"not a part of this campaign in terms of fundraising,\" but declined to discuss him further or address the campaign's procedures for vetting donors. RNC spokesman Danny Diaz said he would not respond to questions from the Tribune, contending the newspaper was biased against McCain.</p> <p>So who is Shi Sheng Hao and what are his means and motives for becoming a mega-donor? No one answers a telephone listed in his name in the 630 area code and there's no answering machine. Messages left for him by phone and email with several relatives went unanswered.</p> <p>But this much can be gleaned from public records:</p> <p>Donation disclosures list his occupation as a businessman with entities identified only by slightly different acronyms: ADECC, AAEC, A.A.E.C.C. On some he is also listed as president of American Chinese Entertainment Ltd.</p> <p>Hao and his wife, Hsin-Ning, declared bankruptcy in 1995, at the time using the Roselle, Ill., home as an address and listing as a business a firm called Asian American Environmental Control.</p> <p>Hao holds an Illinois driver's license that lists his address as the Roselle home, but property records show the four-bedroom house has been owned since 1992 by Robert and Jen Chi and their last name is on the mailbox. Contacted at the Des Plaines marketing firm where she works, Jen Chi said she didn't want to discuss Hao, though she said she knew how to get in touch with him and would have him call the Tribune. He never did.</p> <p>\"I don't know anything about his business,\" said Chi, who herself gave $15,000 to the RNC the week after Hao's first donation. \"I don't want to be stuck in the middle.\" Hao's wife, Hsin-Ning, also used the Roselle address when she made a $25,000 contribution to the RNC last year. In September, however, she listed a Taipei address on a $2,300 contribution to the campaign fund of former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>There is no record in business databases of American Chinese Entertainment Ltd, the firm listed in some Hao donation records. However, an Asian American Entertainment Corp, was incorporated early this year in California with a Shi Sheng Hao as president. Government records show that firm and at least two other Hao companies have connections to the family of Gene and Nora Lum, onetime prominent Democratic fundraisers in the Asian-American community who were convicted in 1997 of making political donations through illegal straw donors.</p> <p>A Taiwanese firm with a nearly identical name as Hao's new California company, Asian American Entertainment Ltd, is also headed by a Shi Sheng Hao. That firm has been embroiled in a lengthy legal battle in Las Vegas over a soured partnership in an application for a casino license in Macau, the former Portuguese colony now part of the People's Republic of China.</p> <p>A court filing in that case described Hao's firm as a business affiliate of the China Industrial Development Bank, a finance arm of the Taiwanese government. Hao is listed as a resident of Taiwan in corporate papers filed in the case.</p> <p>It is not clear whether the Shi Sheng Hao in the lawsuit and the California ventures is the same Shi Sheng Hao using the Roselle address. But public records point to numerous coincidences, including corporations with similar names and an overlap of investors. Some political donations from the Roselle address also refer to Hao by a nickname, Marshall, the same nickname given for Hao in the Las Vegas court action.</p> <p>Federal records indicate a pattern of large and coordinated donations from Hao, relatives and associates. Collectively, eight of them gave a total of $130,000 to the RNC in late September to early October of last year.</p> <p><strong>LOOPHOLE</strong><br>Given federal contribution limits, how can Shi Sheng Hao give $70,100 to John McCain?</p> <p>In general, individuals are barred from giving more than $2,300 to the main fundraising committee of presidential candidates in a primary race and another $2,300 in a general election.</p> <p>But the law has a loophole exploited by Democrats and Republicans alike. Barack Obama and John McCain each control what are called joint fundraising committees that are allowed to put the arm on individual donors for tens of thousands of dollars. Between them, Obama and McCain have raised $300 million that way.</p> <p>The joint committees act as funnels, distributing money they raise to other political committees which, by law, aren't allowed to coordinate with each other on how the funds are spent. That's a feeble restriction since experienced political operatives know how to promote a candidate without comparing notes with colleagues, said Massie Ritsch, of the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics.</p>",
  "<p>I've been thinking about these undecided voters, the 6 or 7% in most polls who still aren't committed. Which way will the undecideds break is always one of the eleventh-hour questions. You have conservatives arguing (natch) that they're all going for McCain, on logic (if they're not for Obama by now, he hasn't \"closed the deal\" and they're not going to be for him) that seems irresistible to many talking heads.<br> The actual story is more complicated. Here again we turn to Nate Silver (it's hard to imagine now, isn't it, that we ever even had elections without Nate Silver!). <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/undecideds.html \">He writes</a> that undecideds break down racially and ethnically in about equal proportion to decideds and observes:<br> </p> <blockquote> <p>Suppose that McCain were to win 2/3 of white uncommiteds -- which I'd probably consider optimistic, although perhaps not since the uncommitted whites appear to be fairly downscale. Suppose also that Obama wins 90 percent of black uncommitteds and 60 percent of Latino uncommitteds. Suppose furthermore that the breakdown of white/black/Latino voters is 74/12/10, reflecting slight increases in the latter two groups from 2004's 77/11/8. Under these assumptions, McCain would pick up 3.9 points from uncommitteds and Obama 2.8 points, a net gain of 1.1 points for McCain.</p> </blockquote> <p>He then considers a couple other factors and concludes that the undecideds are worth one point for McCain. I also have another theory, based on a hunch and no numbers. Maybe many of the undecideds won't vote. An undecided white person, at least, at this point in the game is probably thinking they can't quite vote for the black candidate, but they don't want to vote for McCain. So they may just say to hell with it.</p>",
  "<blockquote> <p>\"The cabinet met late in the day. Peres reported that the settlers were unwilling to leave voluntarily, and that evacuation might mean spilled blood (\u2026) Leftist ministers demanded strong action against the settlers. The cabinet did not quite decide. Its closing resolution (\u2026) stated a preference to avoid \"the distressing results involved in confrontation.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In his illuminating book Occupied Territories: The Untold Story of Israel's Settlements, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gershom_Gorenberg\">Gershom Gorenberg</a> describes how the settlement movement was born of government indecision and duality. Taking advantage of factional splits and political ambiguity in 1975, the few hundred members of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gush_Emunim\">Gush Emunim</a> \u2013 the founding body of ideological, religious West Bank settlers \u2013 manipulated their way into gaining permission to remain on Israeli-occupied land, in spite of governmental and military opposition to their presence. </p> <p>The settlement movement has continued in this vein until today. Throughout this period their exponential growth has been expedited by ongoing governmental ambivalence. Oscillating between covert support and active encouragement, left and right wing governments alike have looked the settlers in one eye and told them to sit still, while, with a wink of the other, they have facilitated their expansion. Settlers built outposts to governments' condemnation, but were gradually provided with electricity and running water and absorbed into existing settlements. Then those outposts built outposts \u2013 and so on. Settlers have been raised like naughty children who, despite the tuts, will always have their parents' consent.</p> <p>This ambivalence has given rise to a dangerous sentiment among settlers of late. Spoilt on the one hand, but restricted on the other, settlers have become increasingly petulant. Even as they are getting away with continued expansion, they feel deprived of their rights. Even as their presence puts an insurmountable obstacle in the way of peace and cripples Palestinian livelihoods, they believe they are the victims of the arrangement. </p> <p>Since the disengagement from Gaza \u2013 which many settlers churlishly term the \"expulsion\" \u2013 more and more settlers feel they are being oppressed; the outcasts of Israel. However, the Gaza withdrawal, too, was an example of governmental duplicity. Even as he seemed to be strong enough for the \"confrontation\" that the 1975 government had sidestepped, Sharon pandered to the settlement enterprise, relocating entire communities from Gaza to West Bank settlements; from one occupied territory to another.</p> <p>Belatedly, the Israeli government is starting to learn the perils of having fostered an unruly child in this way. Forever condemning its misdemeanours while simultaneously supplying treats and concessions, successive governments have watched their child grow into a monster. The spoilt-victim attitude has festered and given rise to a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7640662.stm\">new wave</a> of violence of extraordinary ferocity. Even the Israeli army is now fair game for Israeli settlers on the rampage, who are reassured by historical precedent that as long as they shout loud enough, their demands will be met. </p> <p>Nevertheless, condemnations of the violent fringes of settler society are becoming more widespread. Olmert said of last weekend's rightwing <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1031495.html\">riots</a> near Hebron that he has \"had enough of all this violence\" and defence minister Barak has <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1031936.html\">raised</a> the possibility of banning rightwing extremists from entering the West Bank. </p> <p>However, this is not a comprehensive policy, but merely another example of the slapdash approach to disciplining the child, while the treats (land, expansion, support) continue. The words of these prominent politicians will add to the settlers' sense of injustice, while a lack of any real containment will give them free rein to raise hell. Barak's proposals, then, will simply be another log on the fire of settler disorder.</p> <p>It is time the Israeli government ceased its duplicitous attitude towards the settlements and acted unequivocally, unswervingly and unapologetically. It is for them to put a stop to all settler violence, dismantle all outposts and guard against all provocation, incitement and abuse by settlers towards Palestinians, activists and the authorities. Banning a few extremists and pulling down a couple of houses is not enough when all the other outposts remain and settler attacks on Palestinians continue unabated. A comprehensive and emphatic policy is needed to rescue both Israelis and Palestinians from settler blackmail, until the day comes when a bilateral resolution facilitates an Israeli withdrawal from the Occupied Territories. It is time the spoilt child is told that the game is over. </p> <p>Unless the settlers are reminded that they are not the victims; unless they are told that they have been allowed to get away with too much, their crimes will only increase. The government may still find confrontation \"distressing\", but the alternatives are far, far worse.</p>",
  "<p>Is it really tightening in Pennsylvania? Maybe a little. But the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/pa/pennsylvania_mccain_vs_obama-244.html \">RCP average</a> is still 10.5%. I don't think anyone thinks Obama is going to win the state by double digits. That would be a landslide. I see a win about half that size, maybe six points. But that's still not very close in the scheme of things. The cable nets are going to fixate on Pennsylvania over the next few days (another reason I think an Obama surgical strike in Arizona would be usefully subject-changing), but it's worth bearing in mind as you hear all that that Obama's lead is still about as large there according to multiple recent polls as it is in, say, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/wi/wisconsin_mccain_vs_obama-549.html\">Wisconsin</a>. I understand from an electoral college perspective why McCain keeps fighting in Pennsy and not Wisconsin, but it's still a long shot.</p>",
  "<p>Bill and Hillary Clinton today begin a multi-state tour to rally last-minute support for Barack Obama ahead of next Tuesday's election. </p> <p>The Democrats are dispatching the party's top arsenal of star power to solidify Obama's support in several key states, including Ohio and Florida, and hoping they can bring around voters who backed Hillary Clinton in the primaries and Bill Clinton in past presidential elections.</p> <p>Although Obama has arguably eclipsed them, the Clintons are two of the most popular Democratic politicians in the nation. The former president showed during the 16-month primary battle that he could still draw a crowd.</p> <p>The trip is Bill Clinton's first extended effort on behalf of Barack Obama's race against John McCain. The former president's relationship with the Illinois senator reportedly remains testy, although the two met recently in Clinton's New York City office and posed for a photograph together.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton, a New York senator, has been more conciliatory, at least in public. She has campaigned for Obama, and appears enthusiastic about his candidacy. Clinton won roughly 18 million votes in the primaries, and her already considerable influence in the Democratically-controlled Senate is likely to grow if she campaigns hard for Obama and he wins.</p> <p>Today, Hillary Clinton campaigns in the state of New York for Democratic congressional candidates. She does not have to run for re-election herself until 2012, but may be eyeing a run for the governor's seat in 2010, and this trip would help build support for that.</p> <p>In the coming week, Hillary Clinton will campaign in Ohio, Florida and Virginia for Obama and vice-presidential running mate Joe Biden. </p> <p>Bill Clinton will campaign for Obama today in Pennsylvania and Florida, and attend a rally with Obama in Florida.</p> <p>Tomorrow, he heads to Youngstown and Toledo, Ohio, two depressed working-class cities where Hillary Clinton enjoyed ample support in the state's primary election. While polls show Obama beating McCain by roughly five percentage points, white working class voters continue to resist Obama, and the campaign hopes Bill Clinton will help bring them aboard. Toledo is home to Joe the Plumber, a labourer whom McCain has used a mascot to illustrate the candidates competing economic policies.</p> <p>Bill Clinton then travels to Minnesota to campaign for Democratic Senate candidate Al Franken, a comedian challenging incumbent Republican Norm Coleman. On Saturday, Bill Clinton will campaign in West Virginia. Voters in that state are fond of the Clintons. Bill Clinton was the last Democratic presidential candidate to win the state, in 1996, and Hillary Clinton won West Virginia's primary by 41 percentage points. Polls show Obama running about 11 percentage points behind McCain there. </p> <p>On Saturday, Bill Clinton is scheduled to campaign for Obama in New Jersey, where Obama enjoys a solid lead in polls, and in New Hampshire on Sunday.<br> In the last two presidential elections, Bill Clinton did not campaign heavily for Democratic nominees Al Gore, his vice-president, and John Kerry. Among other things, Clinton was busy that year drumming up support for Hillary Clinton's Senate race in New York.</p> <p>In autumn 2004, Bill Clinton suffered heart trouble and underwent major surgery as Kerry's campaign against George Bush entered its final stages.</p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2008/10/29/20081029asupoll1029.html\">new poll </a> from that state's flagship paper shows McCain with just a two-point lead over Obama, 46-44%. I find it pretty difficult to believe that McCain is going to lose Arizona. Still, I think Obama ought to arrange a weekend rally there for Saturday or Sunday.<br> Here's why. The Obama campaign, as I've been writing for weeks now, has been properly not-too-obsessed with short-term news-cycles victories. But I think this is one case where you want that kind of win. A large rally in McCain's backyard will get tremendous television coverage and will drive two days' worth of speculation on the cable nets about how McCain's situation has become so desperate that he can't even hold his home state. It will give Obama the smell of a winner, and McCain the odor of a loser. And here's why that's important. It's hard for ideologically committed people to believe, but there is a chunk of voters who have no such commitments and who just want to vote for the winner. </p> <p>They don't see a presidential election as that different from any other competition - the American Idol finale, the Rose Bowl - in which they don't have a strong rooting interest. They just want to be able to say, \"I voted for the guy who won.\" Makes them feel like they called it. If Obama pulls off a big rally in Arizona, those voters will watch the coverage and tell themselves, \"This is the guy who's gonna win.\" Could be worth a point or two in some states.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and John McCain are the two contenders in America's presidential election this year, but the campaign has also been dominated by two very different women, Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin. Indeed, many observers believe that women will determine the election's outcome. So, to paraphrase Sigmund Freud: \"What do American women want?\"<br> Until the 1960s, American women were more likely than men to support Republicans. In the 1980 election, a different gender gap emerged, with women more likely than men to support Democrats. In 1996, women's support for Bill Clinton was 14 percentage points higher than men's, and in 2000, women favoured Al Gore over George Bush by 12 points. But, since 1996, the political gender gap has been halved. The women gravitating back to the Republicans, according to conventional wisdom, are <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/columnist/klein/article/0,9565,421149,00.html\">\"security moms\"</a> - suburban wives and mothers who started worrying about their families' safety after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/09/AR2008090903045_pf.html\">McCain's selection of Palin</a> was an attempt to appeal to these mothers and to <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2008/09/22/Poll_Palin_helping_GOP_with_women/UPI-65911222090518/\">pick up votes from women</a> disappointed about Clinton's loss.<br> In fact, the shift to Republicans since 2001 was largely confined to southern white women. In the nation as a whole, notes political scientist Karen Kaufmann, 50% of mothers with children voted for Bush in 2000, and this actually dipped to 49% in 2004. But southern white women, who were much more likely than southern white men to support Bill Clinton in 1996 and Al Gore in 2000, were less likely than southern men to support Democrat John Kerry in 2004. There is now a bigger difference between the voting preferences of southern white women and white women in the rest of the country than between men and women. </p> <p>Outside the south, female voters are less likely to be hawkish on foreign policy and more likely to support spending on health, education and other social-welfare programmes. Women also tend to be more sympathetic to efforts to reduce income inequality, although African-American men are just as \"compassionate\" on these issues as African-American women. </p> <p>Can either party really win by appealing to gender? Women do like to see other women emerge as leaders. When the Democrats nominated Geraldine Ferraro for vice-president in 1984, she attracted huge crowds, just as Palin does today. Shortly after Palin's nomination, one in three white women said that they would be more likely to vote for McCain. </p> <p>At first glance, it seems reasonable that political parties might be able to translate women's gender consciousness into a unified voting bloc. Women do have some common interests, especially with regard to controlling their own reproductive decisions and protecting themselves against sexual exploitation and rape. Most women also recognise and resent that the media judge them more harshly than they judge men. And, because women generally expect to bear most of the responsibility for nurturing children, they tend to evaluate social policies through this lens. </p> <p>But how women address gender-based reproductive, sexual and family interests varies by their class position and their personal options outside the family. Women who compete in the labour market generally support efforts to challenge sexual double standards and vigorously prosecute sexual harassment. But women who are more dependent upon a husband often accept a double standard that stresses female purity and male gallantry. These women believe that adherence to stereotyped gender roles protects \"good\" women.<br> Similarly, women know that they are usually paid less and have less chance for professional advancement than men. But they may choose different strategies for coping with these disadvantages. Those who can or must support themselves outside marriage tend to favour expanding economic opportunities for women and to oppose laws and values that give familial authority to husbands and fathers. By contrast, women with less economic autonomy may feel that their interests are best served by emphasising family hierarchies and reciprocal duties. Wifely deference may be seen as reinforcing the husband's obligation to support the family. Even on issues like contraception and abortion, women's positions are sometimes influenced by conflicting assessments. Women who plan to postpone marriage while building their careers are far more likely to want to ensure that they can avoid or end an unintended pregnancy. But women who believe that their best hope for security is to find a husband often tell interviewers that if other women are allowed to escape the biological consequences of having sex, men will be less willing to offer marriage in return for it. Likewise, women who want to stay home with their children tend to favour tax breaks or family subsidies, whereas women who want to combine work and family are more likely to support expanded childcare and guaranteed parental work leave. </p> <p>In the long run, these differences <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/17/AR2006081701484.html\">outweigh</a> women's commonalities. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/24/AR2008102402698.html?hpid=topnews\">Palin's approval ratings among women fell</a> as they learned more about what she stands for. The main reason some women - and even more men - are more likely to vote for a McCain-Palin combination is not because of Palin's gender, but because her presence on the ticket reassures social conservatives of McCain's willingness to accommodate their agenda.<br> Palin's nomination, however, could have an unintended consequence on the gender views of social conservatives. This summer, the Pew Research Centre found that <a href=\"http://pewresearch.org/pubs/950/mommy-wars\">only 20% of Republicans said they would support a female candidate who had school-age children</a>. Today, those same Republicans seem to find nothing to criticise in the fact that Palin returned to work three days after the birth of her last child. In supporting a woman's choice to combine motherhood with a demanding job, social conservatives now seem to agree with long-time feminists. </p> <p><em>In cooperation with <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</em></p>",

  "<p>Contrary to published reports, the presidential election won't happen until November 4. Those hundreds of thousands of robo-calls, the blizzard of TV ads, or other unforeseen events could propel a Republican team to the White House, leaving president-elect John McCain to assemble a cabinet to run the government. (See Barack Obama's potential green team <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/30/network\">here</a>)</p> <p>The global economic crisis, for the moment, is dominating the headlines, but there is no doubt the next president will have to grapple with daunting energy and environmental issues fairly quickly once in office. For starters, fuel prices could careen upward again, and a post-Kyoto summit between 189 countries to hash out new greenhouse-gas reduction targets is set for Copenhagen in late 2009. </p> <p>McCain would need to decide quickly whom he would trust to navigate his climate, energy, and conservation policies through the tricky shoals of environmental groups, powerful Democrats in Congress, conservative Republicans, and industry barons. Not to mention the leaders of rapidly developing China and India ...</p> <p>So who would staff a McCain administration's environmental posts? Grand Old Party (GOP) Republican insiders, industry lobbyists, and think tankers talked to Grist about names being mentioned for a McCain government.</p> <h2>Secretary of Energy</h2> <p><strong>Pete Domenici</strong><br>Right-wingers who still challenge global warming, or at least linking it to human activities, say they don't have a glacier's chance in hell of being heard in a McCain administration on energy. But if they did, they'd pick Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) to lead the Department of Energy. Domenici, New Mexico's retiring elder statesman, is a backer of nuclear power who's a favorite among conservatives and industry groups, but they acknowledge he probably wouldn't get the nod. Politically, Domenici's tangential involvement in the U.S. attorneys firings wouldn't help him win confirmation, but more practically, he announced last year that he's suffering from a degenerative brain disease.</p> <p><strong>Heather Wilson</strong><br>Another New Mexican who gets mentioned is Rep. Heather Wilson (R), a Domenici prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who lost the GOP primary this year to run for Domenici's seat. McCain, who is pushing construction of nuclear power plants, might find Wilson hard to dismiss. Women and minorities are often traditionally picked for Cabinet posts. A former Rhodes Scholar, she has served on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where she supported nuclear energy, and on the Select Committee on Intelligence, which monitors nuclear weapons. Her district is home to the Sandia National Laboratories, and she is an Air Force veteran. \"From her background in national security, she knows the nuclear issues that make up much of Energy's jurisdiction,\" said Jack Pitney, politics professor at Claremont McKenna College.</p> <p>But environmentalists and others might fight her appointment. Wilson voted to scrap critical habitat for endangered species, and against a multimillion conservation fund that New Mexico farmers backed. The League of Conservation Voters put her on its \"Dirty Dozen\" list in 2002, citing her support for uranium industry practices that contaminate groundwater, and for mining company polluters.</p> <p><strong>James Inhofe</strong><br>Under their breath, industry groups invoke Sen. Jim Inhofe's (R-Okla.) name for this post. But it's hard to see an expanded Democratic Senate majority voting to confirm one of the most outspoken climate-change skeptics.</p> <h2>Environmental Protection Agency Administrator</h2> <p>The nation's top pollution cop, the EPA's mission is to protect human health and the environment under the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Superfund law, and other regulations. Many career staff, scientists, and environmentalists say that under Stephen Johnson that mission has been impossible to carry out, citing his refusal to quickly act on a U.S. Supreme Court order to evaluate greenhouse gases as a public risk, among other decisions. Industry groups say he's gotten a bad rap, but know the winds of change are blowing.</p> <p>\"I think industry groups are all going to have concerns about anybody McCain will pick. In my mind it's going to be Lieberman, or somebody like that,\" said Frank Maisano, an energy specialist at the law firm of Bracewell &amp; Giuliani (yes, that Giuliani). \"Somebody like Sherry Boehlert who's a real champion of the environment.\"</p> <p><strong>Sherwood Boehlert</strong><br>Sherwood Boehlert, who retired last year after 24 years as a New York congressman, is still widely respected by Washington insiders as a consummate moderate Republican. He spent his entire career on the House Science Committee and is best known for his environmental policy work, including helping to design a pioneering cap-and-trade program to control acid rain, fighting for higher fuel-economy standards, and pushing to fund science and math education. He currently sits on the board of the bipartisan Alliance for Climate Protection, headed by former vice president Al Gore. </p> <p><strong>Joe Lieberman</strong><br>Many feel that Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) deserves his pick of plum administration jobs for faithful support of his Senate colleague. As coauthor with McCain of Congress' first attempt at a cap-and-trade program for greenhouse-gas emissions, he could make a good EPA administrator - or perhaps energy secretary.</p> <p><strong>Christopher Shays</strong><br>Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) shares McCain's positions on many environmental issues, including developing wind, geothermal, and biofuel energy, exploring for oil off the coast, and building new nuclear plants. He coauthored a bipartisan bill to improve vehicle fuel efficiency, promote renewable energy, and repeal some tax breaks for fossil-fuel industries.</p> <p><strong>William Reilly</strong><br>William Reilly, a longtime director at DuPont and former president of the World Wildlife Fund, is an investment capitalist who still wins kudos for his tenure at EPA under the first President Bush. In 2007, he pulled off a coup through the leveraged buyout of TXU, which reduced plans for a dozen new coal-fired power plants to three. </p> <p><strong>Christine Todd Whitman</strong><br>Christine Todd Whitman, the former New Jersey governor and later EPA administrator during much of George W. Bush's first term, is a woman who could deliver the message loudly that a McCain administration would not be the same as a Bush administration when it comes to energy and the environment.</p> <p><strong>Mary Gade</strong><br>Mary Gade said she was forced to quit as EPA administrator in the Midwest after tangling with Dow Chemical Co. over dioxin contamination. She is seen by many as a poster child for current agency abuses. She's also a Republican and corporate attorney who understands how EPA works.</p> <p><strong>David McIntosh</strong><br>Conservatives say David McIntosh, a Newt Gingrich Republican who gave up his House seat for an unsuccessful run for Indiana governor back in 2000, would be dandy, while environmentalists say he would be a doozy. McIntosh, now a D.C. law partner, served as executive director of former vice president Dan Quayle's Council for Competitiveness, where he worked to roll back environmental regulations and push a rewrite of the Clean Air Act that would allow polluters to increase emissions without notifying the public.</p> <h2>Secretary of Agriculture</h2> <p>This position executes farming and ranching policy (obviously), promoting agricultural production and trade. But it also administers ethanol subsidies and handles food safety and hunger prevention, including the food-stamp and organic-food-labeling programs. And don't forget that the Forest Service falls under this department, overseeing nearly 300,000 square miles of national forests.</p> <p><strong>Calvin Dooley</strong><br>Conservatives and industry representatives say if McCain is serious about appointing Democrats to high posts, this would be a good spot. They drool over Calvin Dooley, a former Democratic congressman from California's Central Valley who understands agribusiness issues. He was previously head of the Food Products Association and the Grocery Manufacturers Association, two major food-industry trade groups, and he's currently CEO of the American Chemistry Council. But he may be making too nice of a salary at his new job to be lured away for government service.</p> <p><strong>James Leach</strong><br>Some environmentalists, on the other hand, see a Republican they like. Jim Leach, a 30-year Iowa congressman who was defeated in 2006, is now interim director of Harvard's Institute of Politics, on leave from Princeton where he's a professor of public and international affairs. He \"was very much interested in reform and good government, and would not be susceptible to the kinds of political pressures brought to bear on farm policy,\" said Jim DiPeso, policy director for Republicans for Environmental Protection. But that endorsement speech Leach gave for Obama at the Democratic National Convention might dim his chances, not to mention his current job as leader of the campaign finance reform group Common Cause.</p> <p><strong>Ben Nelson</strong><br>Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson is another heartland Democrat who tends to be in line with McCain on a number of issues, particularly climate change. But they don't see eye to eye on ethanol subsidies, which McCain famously told Iowa voters he would cut. Taking a job in a McCain administration would give Nebraska's Republican governor the chance to appoint a GOP replacement, which could factor into Nelson's decision making, particularly if losing his seat would deny Senate Democrats the 60-vote supermajority needed to truly command the Senate.</p> <p><strong>Mark Sanford</strong><br>South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford (R) wins praise from some who note he shares McCain's views on farm subsidies, but others say South Carolina is too far from the nation's corn fields.</p> <p><strong>Terry Everett</strong><br>Alabama Rep. Terry Everett (R) is from the South, not the Plains states or the West, but \"he knows ag backwards and forwards\" because of his long tenure on the House Agriculture Committee, said Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.</p> <p><strong>Edward T. Schafer</strong><br>\"Why not keep the current guy [Schafer] in place?\" suggested Maisano of Bracewell &amp; Giuliani. \"He just came into the job a year or two ago.\" Well, the current agriculture secretary's chances of holding onto his job might be harmed by those E. coli outbreaks.</p> <h2>Secretary of the Interior</h2> <p>The nation's landlord, the Interior Department manages 500 million acres of land and the oil-rich Outer Continental Shelf, overseeing not just oil supplies but coal, natural gas, wind, solar, and geothermal too. The department also administers much of the West's water supply, national parks, relations with the nation's tribes, and protection of endangered species. Traditionally headed by a well-known Westerner, Interior has endured embarrassments in recent years, including meddling by a high-ranking deputy on endangered-species protections that allegedly could have affected her family farm, and drunken sexcapades by Minerals Management Service employees hobnobbing with industry representatives.</p> <p><strong>Dirk Kempthorne</strong><br>There's been some speculation that McCain might just keep current Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne in place. \"That would not be smart in light of the departmental scandals,\" said Pitney at Claremont McKenna College. Environmentalists agree, saying he has protected fewer endangered species than James Watt, is a strong backer of oil-shale leasing in the Rockies, and supported polluting industries as Idaho governor. They say he has done little to clean up agency shenanigans.</p> <p>Nonsense, says Maisano of Bracewell &amp; Giuliani. \"Kempthorne doesn't have an ounce of any responsibility for those scandals; in fact he's been part of the team breaking them up.\" Maisano and others say Kempthorne knows D.C. and the West well (as a former Idaho governor and U.S. senator). Kempthorne has come up to speed on the controversial issues facing Interior, including offshore oil drilling, the proposed listing of the polar bear as endangered, wind power leases, and coal mining permits. He is also as passionate about national parks as McCain. In fact, says Maisano, \"I would think Kempthorne might be more comfortable with the McCain camp than the Bush camp.\"</p> <p><strong>Jon Huntsman, Jr.</strong><br>Utah's Jon Huntsman, Jr. (R), another Western governor who is the son of a chemical magnate, would be more palatable to some. He has been more moderate than expected, and wants Utah to reduce fuel and energy consumption. He is also concerned about nuclear waste being stored in his state, which might raise red flags for McCain.</p> <p><strong>Barbara Cubin</strong><br>Right-wingers say it is vital for McCain to remember that to win and keep Republican support in the West, he needs to select a rural, lands-rights supporter \"who knows something about the history of federal lands and what the problems really are,\" said Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. \"Someone from the intermountain West like Gale Norton, but who is not an urbanite like her.\" Rep. Barbara Cubin (R-Wyo.), a pro-mining, rural Republican who is pushing a bill that would require new refineries to be permitted within 90 days, would be ideal for them.</p> <p><strong>Wayne Allard</strong><br>Colorado's Wayne Allard (R), a veterinarian by trade who is retiring from the Senate, also would fit the bill for lands-rights GOP'ers.</p> <p><strong>Wayne Gilchrist</strong><br>Surprisingly, environmentalists and industry reps alike mention Maryland Rep. Wayne Gilchrist, a nine-term congressman who this year was defeated for reelection in the GOP primary by a right-wing conservative. Gilchrist is a senior member of the House Natural Resources Committee, and he worked for the Forest Service in Idaho for a brief period. But Ebell says it would be ridiculous to have an East Coaster running Interior, no matter how liked he may be inside the Beltway for protecting Chesapeake Bay. The real deal-killer could be his endorsement of Obama, though.</p> <h2>Bonus Position: Energy/Climate Czar (or Czarina)</h2> <p>The 2008 oil spike proved how politically potent energy issues can be. A President McCain might seek to demonstrate a firm hand by appointing a top White House official to coordinate administration policy on energy, with climate change also tacked onto his or her portfolio.</p> <p><strong>James Woolsey</strong><br>Jim Woolsey, the former CIA director turned climate-change and renewable-energy wonk, was hired by McCain during the primary season as a senior adviser on these issues. Some say he's the leading candidate for an energy czar job because he knows global politics so well and is a formidable advocate for domestic energy production as a security policy, not to mention for electric cars. Woolsey has already served under four U.S. presidents in a variety of roles. It would be interesting for the one-time head of the nation's secretive spy agency to sit down with world ministers to hammer out climate-change policy. \"I'm sure he can disarm them,\" quipped one Republican strategist. </p> <p><strong>Sarah Palin</strong><br>Sarah Palin, who has already said she'd like to handle the energy portfolio as vice president, might pull rank and keep the energy czar job for herself. Somebody needs to pick up where Dick Cheney left off, property-rights advocates and climate-change skeptics say. Environmentalists say not a chance. Palin has sued the federal government to stop listing of polar bears as an endangered species and pushed for more oil and gas drilling, among other moves. \"I think Sarah Palin would be great,\" said Ebell of CEI.</p> <p><strong><br>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong><br>California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) is termed out as California governor in 2010, can't be president because he wasn't born in the United States, and is looking for greener pastures. He's got megawatt star power and hands-on experience crafting an ambitious climate plan.</p> <p>\"I can't think of a better energy czar than Arnold Schwarzenegger,\" said DiPeso of Republicans for Environmental Protection. He said that while the \"Governator\" could run for the Senate, \"I don't think he'd be interested. He's the sort of guy who likes to be in charge. \u2026 The best job for the Terminator is to hold a high-level executive position. He's demonstrated an interest in the issue, and he's got the policy right. There wouldn't be any on-the-job training there. He's done the bipartisan cracking of heads and gotten people together.\"</p> <p>Of course, AB 32 -- the California climate law -- has yet to be fully implemented, and Schwarzenegger's popularity has sunk amid the state's fiscal woes. Still, California and its toothsome governor could both be winners no matter who becomes president. Both McCain and Obama have said that unlike Bush, they would order a waiver granted to enable California to proceed with plans to regulate greenhouse gases from automobiles.</p> <p>Curiously, Schwarzenegger hasn't visibly campaigned much for his good friend John McCain (though he's scheduled to hit the trail in Ohio this week on the GOP ticket's behalf). There's talk in Sacramento that the reason is that he'd love to be energy czar for someone else: Barack Obama. With his spouse's Kennedy clan connections (cue the Maria Shriver endorsement footage), he might be ready to pack his bags.</p> <p>Schwarzenegger spokesperson Julie Soderlund laughed off all the talk, saying, \"The Governor is 100 percent focused on California and meeting the challenges the state is facing right now. So at this point the governor is not looking beyond the immediate needs of the state.\" She said he had done half a dozen in-state appearances for McCain, and would stump for him in Ohio on Halloween. Also, his air board's plan for cutting greenhouse gases would give free permits to polluters, which McCain favors, rather than the 100 percent auction that Obama supports. Some environmentalists say while Schwarzenegger has taken bold action at times, he has also vetoed or stalled on key protections, mollifying large utilities and the heavily polluting shipping industry, for instance. Trick or treat, anyone?</p>",
  "<p>If you see a lurid version of Sarah Palin arm-in-arm with Joe the Plumber walking down a New York street this Friday, don't be alarmed. It's only Halloween. This is a city which likes its fancy dress costumes to be topical. </p> <p>A New York chain of beauty supplies, <a href=\"http://www.rickyshalloween.com/\">Ricky's</a>, has carved out a lucrative niche in selling up-to-the-moment outfits for October 31. </p> <p>For most of the year, Ricky's sells make-up, hair products and cosmetics at 23 locations in the city. But each October, it takes temporary leases over vacant stores to create impromptu Halloween bazaars. </p> <p>\"Every Halloween, our beauty supplies stores were becoming more Halloween-ish,\" says Ricky's chief executive, Todd Kenig. \"People kept asking for wigs, costumes, facepaint. The stores would have such an overflow of customers that we started looking for temporary locations each year.\" </p> <p>Kenig seems to have hit upon a winner. Three years ago, he had six temporary Halloween shops in New York. This year, there are 19, making them ubiquitous in parts of lower Manhattan. </p> <p>He says about 20% of his company's $45m (\u00a328m) annual sales now derive from the brief run-up to Halloween. \"I go up and down the entire city of New York, from 125th Street to Battery Park, looking for empty stores every year,\" he says. </p> <p>Americans like their pumpkin-themed festival. The <a href=\"http://www.nrf.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;op=viewlive&amp;sp_id=578\">National Retail Federation</a>(NRF) reckons the US public will spend $5.77bn on Halloween costumes this year - a rise of 14% on 2007. On average, each shopper will splash out $24.17 on a costume and $66.54 on the holiday as a whole. </p> <p>While Europeans tend to stick to dressing as witches, wizards and ghosts for Halloween, pretty much anything goes in the US. Each year brings an eclectic assortment of random costumes from superheros to antiheros, generally with an adult theme. </p> <p>Two years ago, Borat was very much in vogue, complete with hideously revealing <a href=\"http://boratswimsuit.com/\">mankinis</a>. Then there was Amy Winehouse's rehab look, which was something of an easy target, plus Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears in their car crash descents from stardom. </p> <p>This year, Ricky's offers a jumpsuit embroidered with the words \"client nine\" in honour of Eliot Spitzer, the hooker-loving former governor of New York state. There are Obama and McCain masks or a do-it-yourself \"greedy banker\" outfit, comprising a business suit and a pig's face. There's even a costume for pet dogs based on Star Wars' Yoda character. </p> <p>But the hottest look, according to Kenig, is the Palin costume. Ricky's has offloaded mre than 600 sashes bearing the words \"Miss Alaska\", together with about 200 Palin wigs. \"She's the biggest seller, certainly, of all the politicians,\" he says. </p> <p>Ricky's prides itself in getting an outfit into the shops in a matter of days. The Republican hero, Joe the Plumber, only emerged into the limelight on October 15, when John McCain began to trumpet his virtues during the third and final presidential debate. It didn't take long for an outfit to emerge - complete with plunger. </p> <p>\"What really sells is what's happening now,\" says Kenig. \"It's current items that do so well.\" </p> <p>The recession seems to be doing little to dampen spirits. The NRF points out that this year's Halloween is on a Friday, providing a good excuse to party all weekend. </p> <p>\"Though the economy is struggling, Halloween sales may be a bright spot for retailers this fall,\" says the federation's president, Tracy Mullin. \"Consumers, who have been anxious and uncertain for the past several months, may be looking at Halloween as an opportunity to forget the stresses of daily life and just have a little fun.\" </p> <p>About 35% of consumers expect to dress up and 31% will be going to a party. </p> <p>There's a more complex psychological explanation for this outburst of jollity from Bob Thompson, a professor of popular culture at Syracuse University. </p> <p>\"Lately, Halloween has been reclaimed as a holiday celebrated by adults,\" he told Conde Nast's <a href=\"http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/daily-brief/2008/10/01/just-dont-wear-a-dick-fuld-mask\">Portfolio magazine</a>. \"I think this year that the state of the stockmarket, and the economy, and a hotly contested presidential election taking place on November 4 all make October 31 an even riper time to let loose and have a party.\"</p>",

Maybe Lehman Brothers will uncover a spare $50bn mislaid through an accounting error. Maybe Russia will invade Poland tomorrow. (Readers can envisage their own more horrifying scenarios at this point.) Maybe Obama supporters will read articles such as this and not bother turning out. Or maybe all the opinion polls conducted in the last month were wrong. Writing on Cif yesterday, Dan Kennedy provided a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/28/election-obama-mccain-suppression-race\">compelling round-up</a> of the various pitfalls.</p> <p>Alternatively, as Groucho Marx once suggested: \"Who do you believe - me, or your own eyes?\"</p> <p>Based on every shred of evidence, Obama has won and it is all over bar the voting. The only uncertainty at this point is his margin of victory. This is not something that can be said in public, or even out loud, because all parties - Democrats, Republicans and especially the media - have a vested interested in pretending that, oh, <em>anything</em> could happen. And it might. But it probably won't. Obama's lead is <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/\">too deep</a> in <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/polls/2008president/\">too many states</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/election_2008/electoral_count_no_toss_ups.html\">too close to polling day</a>.</p> <p>Exhibit Z: the Republican party is now spending money <a href=\"http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/rnc_goes_up_in_montana.php\">running TV ads in Montana</a>. <em>Montana</em>. If the GOP has to spend a dime defending <a href=\"http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?f=0&amp;year=2004&amp;fips=30\">Montana's three electoral college votes</a>, then it really is in more trouble than in the wildest dreams of a Daily Kos diarist.</p> <p>In the meantime we have to pretend it's a close-run thing, partly because it might be but mainly because it makes for better copy. As you read this, teams of journalists are scouring the US hinterland for doleful examples of incipient and not so incipient racism among voters, to frighten their readers and viewers. In fact, here's a handy template for the stuff currently filling the columns of the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/us/politics/27pennsylvania.html\">New York Times</a> and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/26/AR2008102601766.html\">Washington Post</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The town of [Insert Name], deep in upstate Ohio/Michigan/Indiana, was once a thriving metropolis, renowned as the centre of America's [manufactured good] industry. But its factories have long closed and their jobs shipped overseas to China/Mexico/Botswana. All that is left are the memories of people such as Local Stereotype. Over a cup of coffee in Typical Diner on [Insert Name's] once thriving Main Street - where six out of every four stores are boarded up - Mr Stereotype said: \"I'm from a family of lifelong Democrats. My Pappy and Grandpappy worked here on the [manufactured good] assembly line. Times are hard now, sure enough. But I ain't voting for no Muslim.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And so on. Repeat over several days and forward to the Pulitzer Prize committee.</p> <p>Indeed, the Republican party has decided not to wait for the votes to be counted and has skipped straight on to the <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5igWA77jTUWXP5cqP7Xy1MDq8I1ZQ\">post-election internecine feuding and bitter recriminations</a>. It saves time.</p> <p>Many pundits will declare that the economic collapse in September was the cause of Obama's victory and McCain's downfall. And up to a point they will be right, although the spectacular Wall Street flameout last month will only account for the size of Obama's victory, not its fact. Let's not forget that the US economy was already tanking well before Lehman Brothers collapse - <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=gUkbdjetlY8\">Bear Stearns</a> went belly-up way back in March, and the disastrous fall in house prices and sharp upward spike in home foreclosures and mortgage defaults began last year (and even earlier, in some regions). Output was already slowing and unemployment was rising long before September's surprise. So the economy would have stunk even without AIG and the rest of the debacle. But that won't stop pundits from claiming that the economy only became a big issue in mid-September. They will be wrong.</p> <p>What really lost McCain the election was that he ran a dreadful campaign - one of the worst in living memory. What was particularly hilarious was the way his team seemed intent on replicating, in every detail, the losing formula pioneered by Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries: first run on experience. Then dismiss Obama as just a good speech-maker. Then make some cack-handed racial slurs. Then claim you are really the better agent of change ... the list goes on. (About the only thing McCain hasn't recycled is the <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=N-VFA7L2RcE\">3am phone call ad</a> - and that was Hillary's most effective spot.)</p> <p>Like France's Bourbons, McCain's campaign learned nothing and forgot nothing.</p> <p>Just as Clinton's campaign walked into every trap the Obamanauts laid for it, so too did McCain's. The exception was his feckless choice of Sarah Palin as vice-president - which perhaps damaged him as much as the economy. At a stroke McCain managed to undercut his single biggest advantage over Obama, his years of experience. And Palin's ill-judged and nakedly partisan convention speech instantly shot down any bipartisan appeal to moderate and independent voters. Good work. (Yes, Palin's speech energised the party's base - and that in itself should have set off the alarm bells.)</p> <p>But all this is in the future. Now we have to get back to pretending that Obama hasn't really got this all locked up sometime next Tuesday night.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\"><br>Barack Obama</a> may have the support of high-profile Republicans such as Colin Powell, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> last night won the backing of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/17/barackobama-johnmccain\">\"Joe the plumber\"</a>, who said he feared the Democratic presidential hopeful would make America a socialist country.</p> <p>The Ohio plumber, whose real name is Samuel Wurzelbacher, also agreed with a McCain supporter who asked him if he believed \"a vote for Obama is a vote for the death of Israel\".</p> <p>\"I'll go ahead and agree with you on that,\" Wurzelbacher told the man, a retired Florida lawyer, Stan Chapman, who was visiting Ohio.</p> <p>Wurzelbacher, who declared his support for McCain at a rally in Columbus in the battleground state of Ohio, became a celebrity much in demand by talk shows after he was mentioned during the final presidential debate. </p> <p>McCain cited Joe the plumber as the kind of regular American who would suffer under an Obama presidency. But Wurzelbacher has undermined the Republican argument by revealing that he makes far less than $250,000 a year, meaning he would avoid a tax increase under Obama's tax plan. He would actually be better off under the plan, but says he would be hurt if he were able to buy the plumbing business from his employer.</p> <p>The Obama camp insists their candidate is on the side of middle class Americans.</p> <p>\"It is increasingly clear that John McCain is out of ideas, out of touch and has nothing left but desperate attacks,\" said Isaac Baker, an Obama spokesman. \"But facts are facts: Barack Obama is the candidate who is standing up for the middle class, has a plan to turn our economy around and will give Joe the plumber and 95% of working families a tax cut.\"</p> <p>In his first outing as a McCain supporter, Wurzelbacher said he was \"honestly scared for America\".</p> <p>\"I love America. I hope it remains a democracy, not a socialist society ... If you look at spreading the wealth, that's honestly right out of Karl Marx's mouth,\" Wurzelbacher said.</p> <p>\"No one can debate that. That's not my opinion. That's fact.\"</p> <p>With the White House race approaching its climax, Wurzelbacher will go on the campaign trail in Ohio, making stops in Dayton, Middletown, Milford and Cincinnati. The bus tour includes guests billed as Mary the flag lady, Mike the painter and Linda the fitness trainer.</p> <p>Wurzelbacher has said he is considering a full-time political career. He told the conservative talk show host, Laura Ingraham, that he is thinking of challenging Marcy Kaptur, a Democratic congresswoman for Ohio, in her Toledo area seat in 2010.</p> <p>\"I'll tell you what, we'd definitely be in one heck of a fight but, you know, I'd be up for it.\" Wurzelbacher said. Ingraham offered to help with his PR strategy if he stood.</p> <p>Despite his nickname, it has been revealed Wurzelbacher is not a registered plumber and he owes taxes. </p> <p>Ohio officials are investigating whether government computer systems were illegally accessed for personal information about him. Information on Wurzelbacher's driving licence was obtained from the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles database and further data obtained from a child support agency.</p>",
  "<p>Bad weather on Election Day itself generally harms Democrats more than Republicans, but yesterday the heavy Pennsylvania rain left Barack Obama with the upper hand in the image war: he spoke in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/29/elections-mccain-obama-pennsylvania-swing\">open air</a> to an audience of 8,000, some of whom had waited or hours in ankle-deep mud, while McCain instead decided to cancel a planned outdoors event. \"This is an unbelievable crowd for this kind of weather,\" Obama said. \"If we see this kind of dedication on election day there is no way we are not going to bring change to America.\" But the twin spectres of complacency and triumphalism weren't far away. \"If we're overconfident,\" Obama's deputy campaign manager Steve Hildebrand said in response to one such charge, \"I don't know why we're working so hard.\"</p> <p>Blows were traded on healthcare: Obama seized on a remark by McCain's economic advisor, Doug Holtz-Eakin, that young people wouldn't want to leave their company health schemes for the McCain alternative because \"what they are getting from their employer is way better than what they could get with the credit we're going to give 'em.\" (Holtz-Eakin said his point had been that they'd have the choice.) And the McCain campaign - scrimping and saving? - re-released an ad from August, editing Obama's remarks about Iran to present him as suggesting it wasn't a \"serious threat\". Meanwhile, the website Politico further fuelled rumours of tensions within the Republican campaign, quoting an anonymous McCain aide describing Sarah Palin as a \"whack job\".</p> <p>For more than 12 million of the electorate, however, none of this will make any difference, Daniel Nasaw writes in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/29/uselections2008-barack-obama\">the Guardian today</a>: they've already voted. According to a poll released yesterday by the Pew Research Centre, Obama leads McCain among those who have cast their ballot by 53% to 34%. </p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>McCain, Obama and Joe Biden all visit Florida today, Obama is also due in North Carolina. Sarah Palin is in Ohio and Indiana. And tonight's a big night for political TV: Obama has spent $1m on half an hour of paid programming tonight, which will be aired on Fox, NBC and CBS before an important baseball game. (Some fans are annoyed that the start time will be delayed as a result.) Obama's then due to appear on The Daily Show, while McCain talks to Larry King on CNN. </p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Gallup's daily tracking poll is at 51%-44% among the \"expanded\" model of likely voters, a three-point narrowing compared to yesterday; Rasmussen's is unchanged at 51%-46%. Obama leads among likely voters in the battlegrounds of Ohio (49% to 40%) and Florida (50% to 43%), according to an LA Times/Bloomberg survey.</p> <h2>Quotes of the day</h2> <p>\"They're going to throw out votes. I can't say exactly how, but they are going to accomplish that quite naturally. I'm so afraid for my friend Obama. I look at this through the eyes of the 60s, and I feel there ain't no way they're going to let him make it.\" - Larone Wesley, a 53-year-old black voter in Jacksonville, Florida, expresses a widely held anxiety in the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/us/politics/29anxiety.html\">New York Times</a>.</p> <p>\"When Barack Obama said folks like you and me were bitter, and clinging to religion, I knew he just doesn't understand small town America. We love our God, and we love our guns, 'specially handed down from our grandfathers. And we resent it when liberals like Obama question our way of life. Don't be bitter. Vote McCain\": the country musician Hank Williams Jr in a McCain radio ad in Montana. The telling thing is that the campaign is running ads in Montana at all, since it's usually solidly Republican when it comes to presidential votes.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/29/elections-mccain-obama-pennsylvania-swing\">Rivals slug it out in battleground state of Pennsylvania</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/28/election-the-view-elisabeth-hasselbeck\">How the View got politics</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/29/reggie-love-barack-obama\">The man behind the man: Obama and the aide who makes his campaign tick</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/29/barack-obama-middle-east\">Obama, inshallah!

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/englandcricketteam\" title=\"\">England</a> should once again be declared the winners of the controversial 2006 Oval Test forfeited by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/pakistancricketteam\" title=\"\">Pakistan</a>, according to the ICC president David Morgan. The result of the game was changed from an England win to a draw by the ICC in July, meaning England won the series 2-0 rather than 3-0.</p> <p>\"It was a decision that was made by the ICC and it's a decision that I was not happy with,\" said Morgan, after the MCC met in India last week and urged the ICC to overturn its ruling. \"I was president elect and I didn't believe it was appropriate to change the result of the England-Pakistan match.\"</p> <p>Morgan said that it was still possible for the ICC to reverse their previous ruling after the MCC - the game's law makers - came to the conclusion that the ICC board had made the wrong decision. He added that he'd like to read the minutes of the meeting, too, after the MCC stated: \"the ICC had no power under the laws of cricket to decide that results should be altered, whether it feels it 'inappropriate' or otherwise.\"</p> <p>\"The ICC's decision is wrong and sets a very dangerous precedent. Cricket is the worse for this decision,\" continued the committee chairman Tony Lewis.</p> <p>The win was initially awarded to England by umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove when, on the fourth day of the fourth Test, Inzaman-ul-Haq refused to allow his team back onto the pitch. The Pakistan captain was angry that umpires had given England a five-run penalty after the team was accused of ball tampering. The team were later cleared of the allegations, while Inzaman was suspended for four games for bringing the game into disrepute. Hair, meanwhile, was removed from the panel of international umpires before being reinstated after an employment tribunal hearing last October.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339057067\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1883583839_Obama-HQ-Assembly-V8-FLV-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Arriving in Kansas City, Missouri, we spent some time with Russell Tucker observing a ritual that now takes place across the country every day, especially in battleground states such as this one.</p> <p>Thousands of people sit together in campaign offices, union headquarters and living rooms calling up people they have never met. Thousands more troop through apartment buildings and walk the streets of suburban neighborhoods knocking on the doors of total strangers. Their numbers increase at night, when their own working days are over. Their targets are most likely to be homes, and mobile phone minutes are free. This kind of activity takes place across the US every four years - but never before on this scale. By all estimates, Barack Obama's campaign is running the largest political field operation in history.</p> <p>No one can say exactly how many volunteers are now working to elect Obama. At one point, the campaign said it would <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/07/20/obamas_paid_staff_dwarfing_mccains/?page=3\">mobilize 6 million by election day</a>, but it's impossible reliably to confirm that number, or any other. Like Russell Tucker, who has come to Missouri from South Carolina, many of them have traveled from states dyed so deeply red or blue that their own votes can't change the final electoral count. They want to be where the action is, and where they can make a difference.</p> <p>While Obama has far more paid staff and more money than McCain, the biggest contrast is in volunteers on the ground. <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/\">FiveThirtyEight.com's</a> Sean Quinn - who, like the Guardian team, is traveling across the country west to east, but with a special focus on grassroots fieldwork - had reached Missouri when he <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/on-road-st-louis-county-missouri.html\">wrote</a>: \"Let's be clear. We've observed no comparison between these ground campaigns. To begin with, there's a 4-1 ratio of offices in most states.\" John McCain's campaign offices tend to be sparsely populated, according to Quinn, and they \"are also calm, sedate. Little movement. No hustle. In the Obama offices, it's a whirlwind. People move. It's a dynamic bustle ... You could take every McCain volunteer we've seen doing actual work in the entire trip, over six states, and it would add up to the same as Obama's single Thornton, Colorado office.\"</p> <p>This kind of campaigning is exhausting, inefficient, time-consuming and expensive. It also works better than anything else does - especially in the final weeks before an election, when getting out the vote is everything. In a series of well-known field studies, two Yale political scientists, Donald Green and Alan Gerber, found that personal, one-to-one appeals by volunteers are <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2203146/\">the most effective tactic for increasing turnout</a>. Door-to-door canvassing is by far the best, producing on average one vote for every fourteen visits; personal phone calls by volunteers are the next best. Mailings, emails and calls from paid telemarketers are, by comparison, almost useless.</p> <p>The same is true of robocalls, a favoured strategy of the McCain campaign. Here in Missouri, residents report receiving <a href=\"http://ozarksfirst.com/content/fulltext/?cid=73261\">calls</a> with the now familiar refrain, \"Barack Obama has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, whose organisation bombed the US Capitol, the Pentagon, a judge's home, and killed Americans. And Democrats will enact an extreme leftist agenda if they take control of Washington.\" Another has <a href=\"http://www.stjoenews.net/news/2008/oct/24/war-robo-calls-begins/\">Rudy Giuliani </a> saying that Obama is soft on crime.</p> <p>As part of a Republican campaign strategy that now seems to be based almost exclusively on arousing voters' fears, these calls make sense. But if the experts are right, they can't compete with boots on the ground.</p>",
  "<p>The inability of Tzipi Livni to form a coalition government in Israel and her subsequent calling of elections has sadly obscured two unexpected peace proposals that emerged in her final weeks of horse-trading. The first was an examination by the foreign ministry into a possible <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1029933.html\">non-aggression pact</a> with Lebanon. The second comes after Labour leader Ehud Barak <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/20/middleeast-israel-saudi-peace-plan\">proposed a revival</a> of Saudi Arabia's 2002 <a href=\"http://www.al-bab.com/arab/docs/league/peace02.htm\">peace plan</a> which offers Israel universal recognition in the Arab world were it to fully withdraw to its pre-1967 borders. </p> <p>The forthcoming election battle between Kadima, Labour and Likud will no doubt lead to a simplification of foreign policy issues into a case for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/27/israelandthepalestinians-middleeast\">engagement or disengagement</a> with the Palestinians and Israel's Arab neighbours. However, these two plans deserve closer analysis given they represent a key choice that Livni will face if she succeeds in defeating Binyamin Netanyahu for the premiership in February: whether to persist with Israel's traditional bilateralism in dealing with the Arab World, or adopt a more multilateral approach.</p> <p>With the exception of the 1991 Madrid conference, which then prime minister Yitzhak Shamir only reluctantly attended after serious economic pressure from the USA, the Israeli government has always preferred to handle Arab states individually. From the Camp David Accords with Egypt in the late 1970s to rounds of bilateral talks with Jordan, Syria and the Palestinians in the 1990s after the aberration of Madrid, Israel has actively pursued a divide-and-rule strategy. Thus it has avoided facing a united Arab front and been able to gain maximum concessions from its neighbours. Even Bush's ill-fated <a href=\"http://www.al-bab.com/arab/docs/pal/roadmap2003.htm\">Road Map</a>, and the subsequent <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7037248.stm\">Annapolis summit</a>, which did include representation from some Arab states, had a bilateral flavour. Rather than deal with all its unresolved conflicts with Syria, Lebanon and, theoretically, the rest of the Arab world, Israel was willing to only focus on the single issue of Palestinian statehood.</p> <p>The new Lebanon proposal is a continuation of the bilateral approach. It advocates a ceasefire agreement in which the Lebanese government would rein-in Hizbullah in exchange for an end to airspace violations and negotiations over remaining occupied territory. Though Eran Etzion, the head of the Israeli foreign ministry's planning section, acknowledges this plan could only be effective following a similar agreement with Syria, he still argues that \"Israel can try to advance on a separate political track with Lebanon\" in the meantime. The presumed logic for this would be to progress as far as possible down the road with Lebanon while Syria was also conducting talks with Israel so that Lebanon might be persuaded to continue talks even if the Syrian track fell apart. More cynically, some could view the proposal as an alternative form of divide-and-rule, whereby the Israelis hope to further split the Lebanese by setting moderates against Hizbullah who have, unsurprisingly, already <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=96993\">rejected</a> the idea.</p> <p>Whether part of a Syrian deal or not, the Lebanon proposal typifies the current division within the Israeli peace camp: those who favour a \"Syria/Lebanon first\" approach to peace, and those who advocate pushing the Palestinian track. Both groups advocate bilateralism.</p> <p>Reports that Shimon Peres and now Ehud Barak have recently been promoting the multilateral 2002 Saudi peace plan are therefore quite surprising. Barak has been <a href=\"http://www.fox59.com/pages/landing/?Israel-defense-minister-Israel-seriously=1&amp;blockID=109241&amp;feedID=24\">misquoted</a> a little; he actually wants, \"to introduce a comprehensive Israeli plan to counter the Saudi plan\" rather than fully backing Riyadh's proposals. However, his renewed support for what he calls \"regional peace\", rather than a continued focus on the bilateral Syrian and Palestinian negotiations still represents a marked departure in Israeli diplomatic strategy.</p> <p>However, the Arab world in is not what it was in 2002, and there is doubt over whether the Saudi plan could be made to work were the Israelis genuine in wanting it. One particular obstacle is the renewed <a href=\"http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/JJ08Ak01.html\">cold war</a> between Syria and Saudi Arabia \u2013 two states that would be vital players in any agreement. Even though Damascus <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/843364.html\">endorsed</a> the Saudi plan in 2007, tension is high between the two states. A proxy war is being fought between their militias in northern Lebanon and the Ba'ath regime strongly suspects Saudi-backed Islamists were the perpetrators of Damascus's recent bomb attack.</p> <p>With Syrian president Bashar al-Asad's international stock seemingly on the rise, following support from Qatar, Turkey, France, he may question the merit of handing his Saudi rival the diplomatic victory of playing arbiter in any region-wide resolution. Moreover, Asad has already made clear that the <a href=\"http://www.monthlyreview.org/mrzine/gresh100708.html\">key player</a> in any negotiation will not be Saudi but rather the incoming US administration, which he hopes can provide Arab states with a substantial financial peace dividend, despite the current economic crisis. </p> <p>It is with some irony, then, that if Livni (or Barak) triumphs in February, Israel might shift away from a bilateral approach at the very time when the most vocal critic of bilateralism, Syria, is seemingly changing its tune. The <a href=\"http://joshualandis.com/blog/\">Syrian envoy</a> to Washington admitted this week that disunity and lack of political coordination in negotiations with Israel was the \"sad reality in the Arab world\". As has been seen many times before, this disunity is allowing whoever becomes prime minister the luxury of choice in its approach to the Arab world.</p>",
  "<p>Let's begin this week's jaunt around the theatre blogs by returning briefly to a subject we looked at last week \u2013 free theatre tickets. I mentioned a <a href=\"http://www.artsjournal.com/lies/2008/10/free-night-or-free-nights.html\">piece by Chloe Veltman</a> analysing the impact of the <a href=\"http://www.freenightoftheater.net/index.cfm\">Free Night Of Theatre</a> scheme in the US. Veltman had a number of concerns about the scheme \u2013 not least over the financial impact that it was having on small, underfunded theatre companies. She also raised the question of whether it would actually help to build audiences that keep returning in the long run rather than just going along only when there is a freebie on offer. </p> <p>Veltman put these questions in an email to Brad Erickson \u2013 one of the scheme organisers \u2013 and promised to publish his reply on her blog if he got back to her. <a href=\"http://www.chloeveltman.com/blog/2008/10/free-night-of-theatre-update.html\">Well he did</a>, and he had some impressive things to say about it all. In response to her first question about the economic impact it has on participating theatres, he was keen to point out that the theatres have been \"extraordinarily enthusiastic\" about taking part \"because they understand it to be (for them) a very cost-effective way of attracting first-time patrons to their theatres\". </p> <p>Even more encouraging is the evidence to suggest that this kind of scheme encourages new people to return to theatres as paying customers. Citing a study they commissioned from a market research firm, Erickson says: \"Within six to nine months of Free Night, half of the Free Night folks attend another performance, and pay. They go to the theatre more often than before, and they attribute their uptick in interest to Free Night.\"</p> <p>This all sounds like good news and it is particularly relevant for us in the UK. <a href=\"http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/shenton/2008/10/the-best-things-in-life-are-free-1/#more\">Mark Shenton has been blogging</a> about a meeting he went to recently, where the culture secretary Andy Burnham was talking about the government's plans to give out free theatre tickets to those under 26. Shenton seems impressed by Burnham's passion for theatre in general and for this scheme in particular, and he quotes him as saying \"all of us, and I include myself, need to remember just how affecting theatre can be for young people. It can be life-changing in your late teens and early 20s.\" Let's hope that, when it is launched next year, this scheme can have as impressive an impact as the Free Night of Theatre. </p> <p>Let's move on from blogging about politicians to blogging about politics. In another example of how the theatre scene in the US can be virtually indistinguishable from that over here, <a href=\"http://theaterofideas.blogspot.com/2008/10/why-is-theater-liberal.html\">Edward Einhorn at the Theatre of Ideas blog</a> is discussing why there is so little right-wing theatre in America. He is responding to this <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/15/theater/15thea.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=2&amp;ref=theater\">recent article in the New York Times</a>. Einhorn's fundamental argument is a good one, and sidesteps most of the conspiracy theories that tend to float around this subject. He argues \"choosing theater as a career is almost an act of insanity, and not the sort of insanity typical among right-wingers. It involves choosing to put more time and energy than most highly paid lawyers spend into a job that has few monetary rewards. The best theater is created by people who have, in some active way, chosen not to earn the money they are fully capable of earning in favor of doing art ... This is a mindset that is definitely to the left of not just McCain, but of Obama.\" </p> <p>While we're on the subject of politics and theatre, the <a href=\"http://www.freenightoftheater.net/index.cfm\">Mirror Up To Life blog</a> is drawing attention to the difficulties that some independent Egyptian theatre companies are having as they try to take part in the <a href=\"http://www.cdf-eg.org/English/exp_theater/index_e.htm\">Cairo International Festival for Experimental Theatre</a>. The blog links to an article by an Egyptian critic Nehad Selaiha who, <a href=\"http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/917/cu1.htm\">in a preview piece</a>, argues that the festival could risk looking like little more than \"a show staged for the benefit of our foreign guests to peddle to them the idea that the Egyptian system and its cultural policy makers encouraged free expression and non-governmental initiatives\". In <a href=\"http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/918/cu1.htm\">two</a> <a href=\"http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/919/cu1.htm\">follow-up pieces</a> her fears seem to have been depressingly confirmed as she describes her \"shock and dismay\" when she discovered that the festival had deliberately overlooked the work of the two most genuinely independent companies that they had been asked to consider. Her articles are long, but well worth a read. They make you realise that in comparison, the Arts Council doesn't seem quite so bad after all.</p>",

  "<p>Like millions of people all over the world, Arabs are awaiting the outcome of the US presidential election with excitement and anticipation to see if the new man in the Oval Office turns out to be any more favourable to their interests than George Bush has been.</p> <p>Polls conducted from May to August in six predominantly Muslim countries showed interest in who wins ranging from high in Saudi Arabia and Lebanon to very low in the Palestinian territories and Pakistan. Those who did express a preference preferred Barack Obama to John McCain by margins of at least two to one.</p> <p>Reports of the slogan \"Obama, inshallah\", or God willing, appearing in the Gaza Strip - and even some organised telephone campaigning for the Illinois Democrat - look like vivid but untypical examples of active mobilisation on his behalf.</p> <p>Still, even a brief survey of comments from across the region underlines the sense of qualified hope that, should he win, Obama will turn out to be different - even if the only certainty is that he could not be worse than Bush. Feelings of indifference and cynicism about the result are harder to register.</p> <p>McCain recently provided a painful reminder that Arab expectations of America begin from a very low base when he defended his opponent against the charge that he was not \"an Arab\" but \"a decent man\" - as if the two categories were somehow mutually exclusive.</p> <p>But if US citizens are uneasy at electing a black president whose middle name is Hussein and who was brought up partly in Indonesia, others see huge potential for transformation. \"It's easy to demonise Bush's America if you are a Muslim,\" commented one pundit. \"Less easy if America is led by a black man with a Muslim middle name who grew up in the world's largest Muslim country.\"</p> <p>Probably the biggest immediate hope in the Middle East is that Obama, emphasising diplomacy and dialogue, will be more likely than McCain to avoid war with Iran over its nuclear ambitions. Ali Larijani, the speaker of the Iranian parliament, has explicitly backed the Democrat \"because he is more flexible and rational, even though we know American policy [towards Iran] will not change that much\".</p> <p>Endorsements of this kind do not necessarily help Obama. Yet McCain can hardly be pleased by the support he received via an Islamist website from an al-Qaida supporter who said a Republican victory on November 4 was desirable because likely continuity with Bush's policies meant that the \"failing march\" of the \"war on terror\" will go on.</p> <p>Obama's stance on Iraq - having opposed the 2003 invasion he now backs an ambitiously speedy withdrawal - is distinct from that of McCain, though he shows no signs of any second thoughts about Afghanistan.</p> <p>Strikingly, even some of America's fiercest Arab critics acknowledge that Obama's big theme of \"change\" is a powerful one. Colin Powell's endorsement of him had nothing to do with political party, commented the London-based paper al-Quds al-Arabi, but came about because he is simply the best candidate to fix past \"bloodthirsty\" mistakes. \"It is the choice of a large portion of Americans who want change and to see their country liberated from the slavery of those who hijacked its decision-making and led it toward the devastation we are currently witnessing.\"</p> <p>For most Arabs there is no doubt that the biggest long-term question is whether Obama will be able to crack the nut of Israeli-Palestinian peace, and optimism is hard to detect. Observers wearily note his unblemished voting record for Aipac - the powerful pro-Israeli lobby he addressed immediately after winning the Democratic nomination. Then he was quick to warn those who were enthusiastic about his candidacy not to be \"confused about my unyielding support for Israel's security\".</p> <p>And Senator Joe Biden, Obama's running mate, is a self-described \"Zionist\" who believes that there can only be progress in the Middle East when \"the Arab nations have known that there is no daylight between us [the US] and Israel.\"</p> <p>It may be that energy and commitment - of the kind shown far too late in the day by Bill Clinton - will matter more than any substantial shift in policy. The appointment of a high-profile, heavyweight Middle East envoy could be one way of demonstrating this (though it will help a great deal if the centrist Kadima party rather than the rightwing Likud wins the Israeli elections and the Palestinians can resolve their own bitter divisions).</p> <p>Another key factor could be Obama's promised new approach to Syria, coaxing Bashar al-Assad in from the cold as he cleans up his act in Lebanon and resumes peace talks with a new Israeli government. This weekend's US special forces raid across the Iraqi border - lambasted by Damascus as more of Bush's \"cowboy politics\" - felt like the end of an era. Still, Syria's support for Hizbullah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine seem no more likely to end than its close relationship with Iran. But if Assad had a vote on November 4, it too would go to Obama.</p> <p>Beyond the specific issues on the table there has been much positive comment about the new atmosphere Obama could conjure up. The Arab-American blogger Ghassan Michel Rubeiz described a dream for the future in which the Democrat could be a \"catalyst\" for a more favourable climate and trigger a cycle of virtuous events that could actually resolve the Palestinian issue.</p> <p>\"For the US to vote in an African-American progressive liberal would certainly mark a departure from the hyper and violent conservatism of the Bush-McCain camp,\" observed Al-Jazeera's Marwan Bishara.</p> <p>\"The rest of the world would certainly embrace a less fearful and more open post-9/11 America,\" according to the Egyptian intellectual Mona Makram Obeid. \"Choosing Barack Obama, a symbol of hope, would do more to restore the image of the United States in the world than anything else.\"</p> <p>Sensibly, some have hinted too at the danger of exaggerated expectations. \"It is only natural for Arabs to lean towards supporting a black candidate with roots in Africa on the basis that he understands the concerns of the developing world and is aware that there are other nations who have a right to live,\" wrote Mohammad Salah in the pan-Arab paper al-Hayat. But beware, he said, of \"rosy dreams that the solutions to Arab problems will come from the next US president if he is black and a Democrat\".</p>",
  "<p>The US election may still be six days away, but more than 12 million Americans across the country have already cast their ballots, sometimes queuing around the block to do so, a sign of early enthusiasm likely to translate into a high turnout.</p> <p>According to a poll released yesterday by the Pew Research Centre, Barack Obama is leading 53% to John McCain's 34% among those who have already voted, although the actual ballots will not be tallied until next week.</p> <p>Under the early voting system, 32 states allow voters to cast a ballot before election day, either in person at the polling site or by mail. An additional 14 states and Washington DC allow it if voters can argue they will be unavailable on Tuesday.</p> <p>The long queues would appear to herald a surge in turnout compared with previous elections, with statistics from key states indicating a clear advantage for Barack Obama. \"If we're in an election year where you have to wait two hours to vote early, you can imagine what it will look like on election day proper,\" said Doug Chapin, an election expert at the Pew Centre.</p> <p>Campaigns, voters and poll workers have enthusiastically embraced early voting. Election workers like it because the system allows them to test election procedures, affording them time to iron out flaws. It also lessens the crunch on election day.</p> <p>Voters, meanwhile, welcome the convenience, and if they discover a problem with their registration, there is time to correct it and lessen the risk of being disenfranchised, Obama campaign workers say. That is increasingly vital as states enact polling place identification requirements and strictures on the voter roll.</p> <p>\"The more people we can get out, the fewer we have to deal with on November 4,\" said Faulkner Fox, an Obama volunteer organiser in Durham, North Carolina. \"We can bank those votes.\"</p> <p>In 2004, 22.5% of American voters cast their ballot before election day. That is expected to rise to as much as one-third of all voters this year.</p> <p>\"The question remains if this means a greater share of the 2008 vote will be cast early, if turnout will be up overall, or - as I suspect - a combination of these two factors are in play,\" writes Michael McDonald, an associate professor of government and politics at George Mason University.</p> <p>Research indicates early voters tend to be more partisan than average, and the campaigns of Barack Obama and John McCain have encouraged supporters to vote early. The campaigns have dispatched volunteers and paid canvassers to push supporters to the polls ahead of election day. </p> <p>In Florida, where more than 2 million people have already cast ballots, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Joe Biden, said an early vote could decide a close race.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Michelle Obama has launched a two-day swing through the western US to promote early voting.</p> <p>The queues at early voting stations seem to be aiding the Democrats. While votes will not be counted until election day, the party registration data in key states anticipate an advantage for Obama.</p> <p>In North Carolina, for instance, registered Democrats have cast 55% of early ballots, compared to 28% for the Republicans and 17% with no party affiliation, according to McDonald's analysis. In Florida, Democrats have cast 45% of early and absentee votes, compared to 40% for the Republicans and 15% other.</p> <p>The apparent advantage may narrow because the Republicans typically start their mobilisation efforts closer to election day, McDonald said.</p> <p>One early vote the Democrats were happy to advertise was that of President George Bush, casting his Texas absentee ballot for John McCain last week.</p>",
  "<p>The morning after the last presidential debate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> was fundraising in front of a small group of elite Democrats inside the gilded interior of Manhattan's Metropolitan Club. He spoke about the financial crisis on Wall Street and thanked the Clinton supporters who were present, before explaining how he felt at the start of the final phase of the election.</p> <p>\"As some of you know, I have a body guy named Reggie Love, who is very famous because he's young and good looking. You know, cooler than the candidate,\" he began. \"But the reason I'm raising his name is that the other day, somebody said to him, 'Hey Reggie, how are you?' He said: '20 days!' And so, from here on out, any time someone asks Reggie what's going on, it's '17 days!' After two years of campaigning, that is basically our entire perspective.\"</p> <p>The shared perspective between Obama and Love is the result of an intense two-year campaign which they have experienced like buddies on a ridiculously long road trip. </p> <p>Obama likes to say that he lives vicariously through Love, trapped as he is inside the restraints of a presidential candidate's life.</p> <p>It was Love who introduced Obama to Jay-Z, loading the New York rapper's music on to an iPod which he bought as a birthday present for his boss. (Love himself spends most of every campaign flight wired into his own iPhone.) And it was Love who introduced Obama and his wife Michelle to the fist-bump that Fox News suggested was a greeting between terrorists. In truth, it was a greeting between Love and the staffers and reporters who were pretending (rather sadly) to be as cool as him.</p> <p>Reggie, as everyone on the campaign calls him, is more than a body man, whose official duties are to look after the candidate's personal needs. He carries the candidate's pens, his favourite snacks and drinks, an endless supply of chewing gum (Dentyne and Nicorette), as well as numerous bottles of water. </p> <p>He lines up the podium before the candidate steps out, and adjusts the autocue machines to the correct height, a few inches lower than his own. </p> <p>Body men and women have nothing to do with security - that is handled by the Secret Service - and everything to do with the immediate needs of the candidate. In reality, there is no official job description for a body man or woman. </p> <p>Marvin Nicholson was John Kerry's body man and now serves as Obama's national trip director (he is also one of Love's close friends). A New York Times profile of Nicholson in 2004 described him as \"part butler,\" which only served to heighten the caricature of Kerry as an aloof elitist. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton's body woman, Huma Abedin, was often portrayed as inscrutable and efficient. The only constant is that journalists like to portray body staffers as a mirror image of what they see in the candidate.</p> <p>But the official duties don't come close to capturing Reggie's close bond with Obama, who plays a role that is part boss and part big brother. At the start of Obama's day, Reggie is with him in the hotel gym or local YMCA, where they work out together. As the day rolls along, he travels with the nominee in his armoured SUV, managing the phone call list and dialling the numbers. At events, he is his personal photographer and stopwatch, alerting the candidate to the need to wrap up his comments and stick to his schedule.</p> <p>At 6ft 4ins (1.93m), the 26-year-old Love is a standout presence on the campaign - and not just because of his bald head or his proximity to the candidate. An impressive college athlete, he played football and basketball at Duke University, in North Carolina. After graduating in political science and public policy, Love was talented enough to try out with the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys football teams, but did not make the cut. </p> <p>A year later, he applied for an internship in Congress and landed an interview in Obama's office, rising to the position of deputy political director.</p> <p>Love remains the best basketball player on Team Obama, and one of a handful of the candidate's regular teammates who can dunk the ball on a good day. Whether Love is having a good day depends on his after-hours activities. Early on in the campaign, Love spent a few of those hours having his inner arms tattooed with the phrase: \"My Word, My Bond, My Boyz, My Blood.\"</p> <p>With his prominence has come an unusual degree of public attention. People magazine named Love one of America's most eligible bachelors, a title that he would not dispute. Vanity Fair listed him as one of its In items.</p> <p>Back in his hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina, Love is something of a college legend. At a rally earlier this year, Obama called his body guy on stage and led the crowd in a chant of his name. Then he handed him his jacket to carry off stage.</p> <p>Small wonder that he has his sights set on something other than being a body guy. As the campaign winds down, Love is cramming for law school exams. His goal: to return to Duke and emerge with the kind of qualification that Washington - and the rest of the world - takes seriously.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Wolffe is Newsweek magazine's correspondent travelling with the Obama campaign.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/oct/28/obama-reggie-love-democrat-campaign?picture=339091542\">In pictures: Reggie Love on the campaign trail with Barack Obama</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday October 30 2008.

  "<p>Barack Obama's barber in Chicago says the presidential candidate's hair started going grey around three years ago, and has become more noticeable in the past year. But while many people dread the appearance of grey hairs, Obama is nothing if not an optimist. \"The grey is coming quick,\" he was reported as saying in July. \"By the time I'm sworn in, I will look the part.\" The unusually long campaign, Hillary Clinton and a lack of sleep have all been blamed for Obama's salt-and-pepper look, although there is no definitive evidence that stress can turn a person grey.</p> <p>In 2004, while studying malignant melanomas, David Fisher, a researcher at Harvard Medical School, established that greying is caused by the death of melanocyte stem cells (they sit in the hair follicle, delivering a pigment, melanin, to hairs as they grow). As you age, you have fewer melan-ocytes and therefore you go grey.</p> <p>Some scientists believe greying is entirely determined by your genes, but others believe that stress does play a part. Tyler Cymet, head of family medicine at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, found that patients who had been under stress for two to three years reported going grey sooner than expected. He believes that, because of stress and unhealthy lifestyles, people are going grey around five years earlier than they did in the 1970s. </p> <p>Philip Kingsley, a British trichologist known as the Hair Doctor who has practised for 50 years, also believes stress has a part to play. \"Anecdotally and from my experience, people under stress appear to grow grey faster,\" he says. \"I do notice that. I see a lot of women who have been through chemo- or radiotherapy. With some of them, their hair begins to grow back grey, then it regains its colour.\" </p> <p>Kingsley cites studies that suggest greying could also be linked to a deficiency of B vitamins in a diet. \"Stress depletes B vitamins, so there is a probable connection [to greying], although this hasn't been proven.\" </p> <p>The only certainty in all of this is that, for men, dyeing hair to hide the grey always looks worse, and if they happen to be world leaders, there is something even more desperate about it. I leave you with two words: Silvio Berlusconi.</p>",
  "<p>Sell Obamas now. They are overpriced and the forward market has gone crazy. If he becomes president, the bubble will burst, I guess in the spring of next year. From the moment four years ago when I first heard of Barack Obama and read his youthful memoir, I sensed a president in the making. Like the young Nelson Mandela in South Africa, he seemed to hold the aura of incipient national leadership. His range of sympathies, his oratory, his intelligence, his energy marked him out from the run. His embodiment of the American dream was astonishing.</p> <p>Today the outside world, much of it with a direct and painful interest in American policy, wants Obama to win, by leads of 20% to 60%. These people have no vote. But the narrower electorate of the United States appears also to want Obama to win, albeit by a smaller margin. The world prefers him chiefly because he is black, the latter chiefly because he is not Republican.</p> <p>Neither reason is robust. To most non-Americans, black is still code for being apart from the American establishment. Any visitor these days to Europe, to Africa or to the Muslim world is shocked by the depth of antipathy to the US. It is beyond ideology, a visceral, often racial aversion, unrelated to any personal attachment to individual Americans or their much-envied way of life. The ugly American is reborn.</p> <p>Yet the same visitor is impressed by how often he is assured that an Obama presidency would \"change everything\". The reason is not that Obama is anti-war or pro-Palestinian or left or rightwing. It is that his origins render him the one thing he most vociferously denies, not an ordinary American.</p> <p>To this world, Obama is a supposed representative of an oppressed class, however much his speech, manner and career bespeak the opposite. He is black and his name is confirmation enough. He symbolises the end of the Wasp ascendancy. The reason why his candidacy still discomforts many Americans is the reason the world craves it, that Obama is somehow unreal.</p> <p>He is a meta-American. It is why there will be an awful unleashing of grief and fury if he is not elected. Yet Obama is real, not just a human being but a politician. In office he knows he must do more than make fine speeches and castigate the government of the day. He must grapple with the wreckage of a world economy whose collapse is in large part due to the mismanagement of American finance, from which as a senator he cannot altogether escape blame.</p> <p>He must restore credit to markets and confidence to commerce. He must bring health and welfare to a country whose poor will seem ever more \"third world\", as unemployment bites in the coming months. To millions of Americans he will seem like a messiah. There are millions whom he can only disappoint.</p> <p>Abroad, this leader would have to end not one war but two, and bring sanity to an American diplomacy that is chaotic in an arc of instability from eastern Europe to the Himalayas. The anticipation that he will be a harbinger of peace, friendship and economic salvation is probably greater than for any American since Roosevelt. The burden of expectation is awesome and unrealistic.</p> <p>The qualities of charisma and rhetoric that Obama brings to this task may be a match for it. His declared policies are not. His desire to disengage from Iraq is not appreciably different from that of the Bush administration and the Iraqi government. On the other hand, his clearly expressed wish to beef up the war in Afghanistan is reckless.</p> <p>Obama has approved the bombing of targets inside Pakistan (and presumably now Syria) and proposed invasion to \"secure\" that country's nuclear arsenal. He has backtracked on compromise with Iran and done nothing to suggest an end to the macho provocation of Russia.</p> <p>At home Obama would appear from his statements and voting records to be a conventional Democrat, essentially tax, spend and protect with tariffs. While some of this is America's business, the world economy needs a protectionist US like a bullet in the head. American markets open to world goods are vital for recovery, as is America's active participation in the easing of world trade. Obama has shown no sign of accepting this.</p> <p>On all these fronts there is a more alarming prospect. It is that a Democratic president, even with an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress, must beware of seeming soft or dovish or \"appeasing terror\". Such is politics that the more liberal the man, the more illiberal he can feel compelled to behave, as was the case with Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. Obama has yet to indicate a retreat from the Patriot Act or the language of George Bush's war on terror.</p> <p>Any modern leader parrots the language of change. Obama proclaims himself the embodiment of a revolution in American public life. Yet his record is anything but radical. He even supports the right to bear arms. Were it not for his colour, he would be a candidate running on a conventional Democratic ticket, with few policies more constructive than those of his opponent, John McCain, on how the US might now escape from its many predicaments.</p> <p>None of this is an argument for not voting for Obama. In present day Washington even modest competence might seem revolutionary. But democratic leadership is like Icarus. Its wings melt as soon as it flies close to the sun. Obama is flying close indeed.</p> <p>The instant message that an Obama victory would flash round the world is not in doubt. It would transform and refresh the US's image, exhilarating its friends everywhere. It would restore to that country the reins of global leadership so missing in the era of Republican xenophobia. It would be an utterly good thing.</p> <p>The next message could be very different. The skills that Obama has brought to his campaign are essentially personal and organisational, not the superhuman ones that will be required of any occupant of the White House in the immediate future. The higher the anticipation, the more crippling will be the effort needed to meet it, and the greater the fall if it is not met.</p> <p>The prospect of a failed Obama presidency at some time in 2009-10, whether by his doing or those of circumstance, is heartbreaking to contemplate. It would more than undo the gains secured by his election and devastate the cause he is seen as representing. The least his supporters can do is not raise the bar of expectation too high.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\">simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339097000\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1886152824_McCain-Hershey-rally-To-Brightcove-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Barack Obama demonstrated his pulling power by attracting thousands to an outdoor rally in torrential rain yesterday in Pennsylvania, a state on which John McCain has staked almost all his hopes of a surprise win in next Tuesday's election.</p> <p>Confirming the state's pivotal position on the electoral map, McCain was also in Pennsylvania, campaigning alongside his running mate, Sarah Palin, who told a crowd of about 10,000: \"It is going to come down to the wire here.\"</p> <p>Although it was one of McCain's best performances in weeks, he is facing polls that put Obama consistently ahead - the latest has Obama on 51% to McCain on 41%. He is also beset by continuing distractions over Palin. Amid persistent rumours of strains between his campaign team and her advisers, the Politico website quoted one of his aides, speaking anonymously, describing her as a \"whack job\".</p> <p>With time running out for McCain, Obama yesterday showed how difficult it will be for the Republican candidate to make up ground in the state. In spite of ankle-deep mud and freezing rain, campaign workers estimated about 8,000 people waited hours for him to arrive in Chester, on the outskirts of Philadelphia, huddled under umbrellas, draped in plastic ponchos and wearing plastic carrier bags over their shoes.</p> <p>\"This is an unbelievable crowd for this kind of weather,\" Obama told them when he stepped out in a dark rain jacket over jeans. \"If we see this kind of dedication on election day there is no way we are not going to bring change to America.\"</p> <p>Pennsylvania, which has voted for Democrats in every presidential election since 1988, is the only Democratic state where McCain is still strongly competing. Despite a strong poll lead over McCain, Obama's main ally in the state, the governor, Ed Rendell, has warned the campaign not to take Pennsylvania for granted.</p> <p>Although Obama is ahead overall, detailed polls show several key counties have tightened in McCain's favour in the last week and the two are in a dead heat.</p> <p>McCain is also pinning his hopes on white, working-class voters reluctant to turn out for Obama on grounds of race. But many of them are angry over the economy, and the blame they attribute to the Republicans outweighs prejudice.</p> <p>McCain's rally was indoors, at the Giant Arena in Hershey, the central Pennsylvania home of the chocolate bar, and, after days of attracting derisory crowds, he almost filled the 12,000-seat stadium. He appeared to be reinvigorated, and to have settled on a message portraying Obama as a socialist and untested in a crisis.</p> <p>Appearing to address reports of tension between his and Palin's teams, McCain, standing only a few feet from her, said: \"When two mavericks join up we don't agree on everything, but it's a lot of fun.\"</p> <p>McCain took a swipe at Obama over the $1m he is spending on a half-hour paid-for TV address tonight, unprecedented in US political history. It will be held before a World Series baseball game, delaying the start, to the irritation of some fans.</p> <p>\"By the way, no one will interrupt the World Series for an infomercial when I'm president,\" McCain said.</p> <p>In spite of a standing ovation, many in the audience had turned out to see not McCain but Palin, who received the loudest cheers. Some of the audience left after she had spoken and before McCain had a chance to begin.</p> <p>Despite Obama's turnout yesterday, there is still resistance to him in places such as Hershey. Kim Condran, 40, a health worker who was at the McCain rally, thought he could still take Pennsylvania. \"Obama is not a truthful person. I don't think he is revealing everything in his past. He has too many connections to foreigners, the bad ones,\" she said.</p> <p>McCain and Palin had a good turnout given the event was early in the morning, that it was a working day, and that the rain was heavy. But McCain opted against testing whether he is capable of drawing, like Obama, an outdoor crowd in heavy rain, cancelling such an event later in the day.</p> <p>Pennsylvania's two major cities, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, are expected to vote heavily for Obama, while McCain hopes to wrap up the small towns and rural areas sandwiched between them.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, the Obama camp is worried about long lines at polling stations and other disruptions in battleground states. Voting rights advocates in Pennsylvania have filed lawsuits to demand state election officials increase their supply of paper ballots, and have reserves of trained poll workers on hand.</p> <h2>Pennsylvania</h2> <p>Pennsylvania's 21 electoral votes are crucial for McCain if he hopes to win the election. In the centre of the state, religious, culturally conservative white voters dominate the electorate. But Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, in the western and eastern ends of the state, are home to large numbers of African-Americans, students and more affluent liberal voters inclined to back Obama. </p> <p>McCain hopes to exploit that support, though the state has not voted for a Republican since 1988 and polls show Obama has built a sustained lead of about 12 points.</p> <p>The state, which was politically and culturally prominent early in US history, has seen hard times in recent decades. A top source of jobs, western Pennsylvania's steel industry, has been in long-term decline. The state has the second-largest elderly population in the country, after Florida.</p>"
