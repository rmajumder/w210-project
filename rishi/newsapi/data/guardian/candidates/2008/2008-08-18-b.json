  "<p>We are far more used to politicians' offspring embarrassing mum or dad than helping in their election efforts. You could rely on Mark Thatcher or Ronald Reagan Jr to cause headaches for their parent's PR advisers, not do their jobs for them.</p> <p>Yet 24-year-old Meghan McCain has done just that, eulogising her father in an illustrated children's book called My Dad, John McCain Aimed at five- to 10-year-olds, it chronicles the presidential hopeful's struggles as a student and his heroics as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.</p> <p>It's easy for us Brits to assume that such sentimental spin will backfire but, having lived in the US for three years, I can assure you that Americans are made of gooier stuff. There, a commitment to \"family values\" isn't seen as a devalued political soundbite but the sine qua non of a politician's suitability for office.</p> <p>But the McCain book takes matters one step further and springs, I suspect, less from a daughter's blind love for her father than some strategist's cynical desire to simplify the campaign's line. I suspect that the real target readership isn't America's primary school kids but their parents, who will buy it for their kids but read it themselves. At the very least they will see it featured on TV and make the association, \"Well, his daughter loves him so he must be a good man.\"</p> <p>It may be cynical but it will, probably, win votes in what could be a very close election. The problem with raising the profile of a politician's child, though, is keeping them on message. If Meghan McCain strays from her syrupy fairytales between now and November 4, the media will have a field day, and the happy ending envisaged by the architects of her book may never materialise.</p>",
  "<p>The morning after President Pervez Musharraf took power nine years ago, Islamabad was its usual sleepy self. Only the soldiers on guard outside the television headquarters and homes of senior ministers signalled that once again civilian democratic government in Pakistan had been replaced by military rule. </p> <p>Yesterday again there was little outward sign - for the moment - of the latest regime change. But few doubt its genuine significance. </p> <p>In the short term, the coalition partners of the Pakistan People's party, led by Benazir Bhutto's widower, Asif Ali Zardari, and the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) faction of Nawaz Sharif, the two-time former prime minister, will simply be celebrating with supporters and stressing that \"continuity and unity\" would be their watchwords. </p> <p>But both men and their supporters harbour not only a personal antipathy towards the former president, who imprisoned and exiled Sharif after ousting him in 1999, but for each other. Their alliance was one of convenience against a common foe. For the next few months, it is likely the fragile truce between the two parties will hold. Following the largely free and fair election in February, the PPP is ostensibly in the driving seat. But its majority in parliament owes more to the violent death late last year of leader Benazir Bhutto than to any genuine popularity. </p> <p>Sharif, however, will bide his time before provoking a new election. The PML-N needs to consolidate its base in the wealthy eastern province of Punjab and integrate the supporters who flow back from the faction of the Pakistan Muslim League once loyal to Musharraf. These include major powerbrokers - and their arrival, plus other elements of Pakistan's pragmatic political elite that the inevitable horse trading will win over, could well give Sharif's party the majority it needs to win power. </p> <p>So the scene is set for a lengthy struggle in which the PPP is likely to find itself on the back foot. The politicking will naturally dominate decision-making.</p> <p>Immediate indicators of which way the power is flowing will be the question of the restitution of judges suspended by Musharraf and the effective nomination or contested election of the new president. Neither party has made strong policy statements. The drastic measures necessary to tackle the major problems facing Pakistan - particularly the growing extremist insurgency in the west and the flagging economy - are unlikely to be seen in the near future. </p> <p>Overseas powers - particularly the US - are in an unenviable position. Having backed Musharraf, then engineered the return of Bhutto with a view to giving his regime a moderate, pro-western civilian face, they now find themselves having to deal either with chaos, a weak PPP-led coalition or Sharif, who is representative of a nationalist and religiously conservative strand increasingly widespread in Pakistani society. </p> <p>The fact that much of Sharif's appeal is due to his perceived distance from Washington will not help matters. However, American aid props up much of the economy and finances a large part of the powerful military's budget. Having funnelled their aid through Musharraf, the US will have to decide who now is their favoured interlocutor. The army is of course still very much a player. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Any fragile stability in Pakistan has depended on a balance in powers of the ruling \"troika\" - the president, the prime minister and the army chief. </p> <p>One thing is sure: 173 million Pakistanis, the region and the international community are in for a bumpy ride. We may yet see nostalgia for the Musharraf years - which of course will help legitimise any future move by the military to take power once again.</p>",
  "<p>Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, bowed to massive domestic and international pressure to quit yesterday in a move that could further destabilise the volatile country if the coalition government fails to hold together now that their common enemy is removed.</p> <p>A grim-faced Musharraf delivered an impassioned defence of his record on live television that lasted for over an hour. He kept the news of his resignation until the final moment, ending his almost nine years in power with \"God bless Pakistan\". <br></p> <p>\"If I was doing this just for myself, I might have chosen a different course but I put Pakistan first, as always,\" said the president, wearing a western suit and tie but speaking in the national language, Urdu. </p> <p>The coalition government, led by the Pakistan People's party and Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-N, had managed to stage a bloodless counter-coup by announcing two weeks ago that they planned to impeach the president.</p> <p>Most members of the coalition government, which came to power after elections in February, did not want to go through the trauma of impeachment proceedings, hoping the threat of prosecution would be enough to convince the president to go. That strategy proved successful just two hours before parliament was due to meet to officially start the prosecution process. </p> <p>Yousaf Raza Gilani, the prime minister, said: \"Today, parliament has become sovereign. We can hold our head up high in the world and say that we too are a democracy.\" </p> <p>Raza Rabbani, a leading member of the Pakistan People's party, said: \"This is the first time in Pakistan's political history where you have the people winning against establishment institutions.\"</p> <p>The crisis that led to Musharraf's departure has been brewing for more than year. He sacked the respected chief justice in March 2007, and later declared a state of emergency. The popular opposition leader Benazir Bhutto was assassinated late last year, and elections in February saw the coalition government elected and determined to oust him.</p> <p>It had been predicted that Musharraf would step down as a part of a western-mediated agreement between the president and the coalition government, which would give him immunity from future prosecution. He also wanted to be able to stay living in Pakistan. It is thought that his terms have been met, though he suggested that no deal had been cut. </p> <p>\"I don't want anything from anybody. I have no interest. I leave my future in the hands of the nation and people,\" Musharraf said. \"Let them be the judges. Let them do justice.\" </p> <p>While there seemed to be no formal agreement, political insiders suggested that Musharraf would have received assurances from the Pakistan People's party, which leads the coalition, that would have been guaranteed by the army. </p> <p>Pakistan's people and its western allies hope that removing the president, who seized power in a 1999 coup but gave up his army uniform late last year, will mean the coalition can now get on with the business of governing. </p> <p>But while the issue of the impeachment had brought the largely dysfunctional coalition together, analysts warned that there would now be a tussle over who would succeed as president and whether the judges fired by Musharraf would finally now be restored - Sharif wants the judiciary reinstated but Asif Zardari, Benazir Bhutto's widower who now leads the Pakistan People's party, is thought to still be reticent.</p> <p>\"There's no stable settlement. These two guys [Sharif and Zardari] will now start slugging it out,\" said Najam Sethi, editor of Pakistan's Daily Times. \"The political interests of the two are diametrically opposed.\" </p> <p>Musharraf leaves Pakistan in the hands of the same politicians that he had repeatedly denounced. But he admitted that he had no choice. </p> <p>\"Even if I beat this impeachment, relations between the presidency and the government can never be fixed. Pillars of the state - parliament and the judiciary - would be harmed and, God forbid, the army might have been dragged in,\" he said. \"No 'charge sheet' can stand against me because I never did anything for myself. Whatever I did, I put Pakistan first.\" </p> <p>Britain praised Musharraf yesterday but was quick to distance itself from him. \"It is important to highlight President Musharraf's commitment to tackle terrorism, to promote dialogue with India, especially over Kashmir, and to root out corruption,\" said the foreign secretary, David Miliband. \"But reform depends above all on legitimacy, and that is why the UK has been at pains to stress the importance for Pakistan of strong institutions rather than strong individuals, and why we believe a strong democracy is key.\"</p>",
  "<p>In a series of pioneering studies of ancient pottery, the archaeologist John Dore, who has died from blood cancer aged 57, created a body of research that will be of great importance for the interpretation and dating of archaeological sites ranging from north Africa to northern Britain.</p> <p>The scope of his work is breathtaking, extending from the coastal cities of Sabratha, in Libya, and Leptiminus, in Tunisia, through the pre-desert frontier lands explored by the Unesco Libyan Valleys survey to the Saharan communities of the Libyan Fezzan. In the coastal and pre-desert projects, John dealt with pottery ranging from the Punic to Islamic periods, while in the central Sahara the scope of his research covered the complete duration of pottery-making from the neolithic to the recent past. </p> <p>Scarcely less substantial is the body of work devoted to the archaeology of Hadrian's Wall and the pottery of Roman Britain, including the co-authored National Roman Fabric Reference Collection, cataloguing the pottery wares of Roman Britain. </p> <p>John achieved all this without a full-time university lectureship. Nonetheless, he had established himself as one of archaeology's most distinguished ceramicists, even though he had yet to realise the full potential of his outstanding corpus of work for understanding the development of north African settlement and trade patterns.</p> <p>Born in Altrincham, Cheshire, John was brought up to appreciate the value of historical inquiry; his father, a teacher at Manchester grammar school, was a distinguished local historian. After studying Latin and archaeology at Birmingham University (1969-72), John's interest in north African archaeology was sparked by Barri Jones, lecturer in Roman archaeology at Manchester. </p> <p>John's appointment in 1974 as research assistant to John Gillam, at Newcastle University, then the foremost scholar of Roman pottery in northern Britain, led him to the study of pottery on the northern frontier. John was occasionally called in to rescue his aged mentor, whose tempestuous marriage had once seen him ejected from the family home to shelter in a telephone box in his underwear in the middle of the night. After Gillam's death, John co-edited his report on excavations at Corbridge Roman fort.</p> <p>From 1974 to 1987 John undertook a series of short-term research contracts at Newcastle University, broken by a spell as curator of the English Heritage Hadrian's Wall museums in 1983-85, when he oversaw the opening of a new museum at Corbridge. Subsequently, working as a freelance consultant, he was instrumental in bringing to press a number of important excavation reports on sites along Hadrian's Wall, and undertook the first of his seminal studies of north African pottery, publishing the assemblages excavated at Sabratha and becoming lead ceramicist for the Unesco Libyan Valleys survey. He also directed the excavation of Ottoman and medieval levels at Al-Marj, in eastern Libya.</p> <p>Between 1995 and 2002 John returned to Newcastle University as director of the Archaeological Practice, its archaeological contract unit. During this period he was also lead ceramicist on a Leverhulme-funded study of pottery from the Saharan kingdom of the Garamantes.</p> <p>Returning to consultancy work from 2003, he conducted further research on the Libyan Fezzan as lead ceramicist for the Desert Migrations project and assumed the same role in the joint Bradford/Oxford University excavations at Pompeii. He also readied for publication the last of Gillam's unpublished excavations, at the Hadrian's Wall fort of Halton Chesters, and maintained a steady output of specialist pottery reports, as well as undertaking a postgraduate diploma in advanced Arabic and an MA in Arabic-English translation from Durham University.</p> <p>This last accomplishment highlights John's broader attitudes to the region he devoted so much of his life to studying. He never viewed north Africa's classical past as divorced from its present. Fluent in Arabic and fascinated by all aspects of north African and Middle Eastern history, culture and politics, his willingness, as head of mission for the Society for Libyan Studies, to undertake the quiet diplomacy essential to the smooth functioning of any British academic institute abroad was greatly valued by his British and Libyan colleagues alike.</p> <p>With interests including music, cycling and new technology, John was far from being a narrow obsessive. In Newcastle, he gave time to the North East Refugee Service from its inception in the early 1990s. He was an engaging and charismatic teacher both in a formal academic setting and when leading guided tours of classical sites in Libya and Tunisia. Those fortunate enough to work alongside him will remember his extraordinary blend of consummate professionalism and wry sense of humour, which, armed with a marvellous turn of phrase and arched brow, could rapidly reduce those sharing an office to tears of laughter when he was confronted with the absurd or supercilious.</p> <p>Married briefly in his 20s, John shared a partnership for more than 20 years with Ellen Watts, with whom he had two sons, Tom and Joe. He is survived by his partner Linda Green, his sons and brother.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>John Nigel Dore, archaeologist, born March 25 1951; died June 9 2008</p>",
  "<p>The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, looked to a future beyond General Musharraf yesterday, affirming that America's ties to Pakistan went far deeper than the military dictator closely associated with George Bush's \"war on terror\".</p> <p>Although Rice paid tribute to Musharraf as \"one of the world's most committed partners in the war against terrorism\", there was a sense that few in Washington were mourning his departure. </p> <p>Rice said in a statement: \"We will continue to work with the Pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on Pakistan's future and its most urgent needs, including stemming the growth of extremism, addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability.\"</p> <p>The general's exit will undoubtedly force changes in how the administration deals with such a strategic region, and how it confronts the global problem of Islamist extremism. But those changes were being discussed before yesterday.</p> <p>At the very least, the era when Musharraf served as a one-stop shop for American interests in the region is at an end. </p> <p>As one of the first Muslim leaders to support Washington after 9/11, Musharraf risked alienating his own people by allowing US forces the use of Pakistani military bases. In return he cemented his power with an infusion of $10bn in US aid. </p> <p>But that partnership had long been seen in Washington to have outlived its utility. No matter who emerges as Musharraf's successor, it was widely acknowledged yesterday that American policy would now need to engage civilian as well as military and intelligence circles in Pakistan.</p> <p>\"Musharraf's departure signals the end of a de facto presidential form of government in Pakistan,\" said Shuja Nawaz, an analyst in Washington. \"He had concentrated power in his own hands by virtue of the fact that he was also head of the military.\"</p> <p>In any event, Bush has just 155 days left in the White House. Both his would-be successors, the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican John McCain, have indicated they would change course after the election.</p> <p>\"Both the Pakistanis and the Americans are going to have to decide what kind of policies they follow with regard to foreign affairs and economics, and that will depend in no small measure on the attitude that the US Congress and a new US president will bring to the entire region,\" said Paula Newberg, an analyst in Washington.</p> <p>Obama said yesterday he had long advocated a \"move from a 'Musharraf policy' to a Pakistan policy\".</p> <p>\"I hope all of Pakistan's friends will now seize the opportunity created by Musharraf's exit to focus on the urgent issues of today: confronting the threat of extremist violence, dealing with food and energy shortages, and helping the Pakistani people build a stable, secure, democratic future,\" he said in a statement.</p> <p>McCain, in his statement, also indicated that the relationship with Musharraf had perhaps outlived its value to America. \"I hope that the elections for President Musharraf's successor will serve to reconcile the Pakistani people behind a leader who can solidify their government internally,\" the statement said.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, the Bush administration had been frustrated for some time with Musharraf. Administration officials began describing the relationship with Pakistan as \"complex\" and last week state department officials described Musharraf's struggle to hang on to power as an \"internal matter\".</p>",
  "<p>In the end, Pervez Musharraf did the wise thing by quitting office peacefully. He submitted his resignation as president of Pakistan to the speaker of the national assembly, and left office saluted by an honour guard. This is a first in the history of a country where military rulers have struggled to achieve the legitimacy they crave. If he had followed his instincts by fighting impeachment charges in parliament, he would have dragged the army's name into disrepute. Even if parliament had failed to come up with the votes for an impeachment, it would not have solved the underlying crisis - a democratically elected government which could not work with its president. By resigning before charges were laid, the former commando has done himself and his country a large favour.</p> <p>Assessing the general's performance over the past nine and a half years since he seized power in a coup is not a straightforward task. He was not a military dictator in the classical sense, nor was he religious. He liberalised the media, and in so doing, created a rod for his own back. He attempted to improve the status of women by pushing for the amendment of Islamic laws. Perhaps his greatest achievement was to shift his country's thinking on India, when it went against the grain of the Pakistan military establishment.</p> <p>But his main project, the construction of a modern enlightened state, was doomed to failure. Not only because he tried to do so on the back of a feudal, patronage-driven political machine. The general's rule failed because he disdained democratic norms, like functioning political parties, the constitution and free elections. The rot set in after 2002 when he ordered a referendum on his legitimacy as president, in which no opposition candidates were permitted to stand. He packed parliament with his supporters and had no qualms about courting conservative religious parties in the troubled North-West Frontier Province. His nemesis came in the shape of the chief justice, Iftikhar Chaudhry, who was about to hear legal challenges to the president's re-election. Mr Musharraf can date his downfall very precisely to the day, on March 9 last year, when he tried to sack Mr Chaudhry, triggering a nationwide protest and, ultimately, a state of emergency. It turned him from a struggling leader into an unpopular dictator and support has haemorrhaged ever since. Not even the head of the army turned up to the president's celebration of independence day last week, a clear sign that his days in power were numbered. </p> <p>The coalition that unseated him is unlikely to last long. Its other main task is to amend the constitution, stripping the presidency of its two main powers - the ability to sack the government and appoint the head of the army - and restoring the powers of the prime minister. If it does that, it will fall apart and fresh elections will be held. This should not, of itself, be a cause for alarm. Political pluralism is not the only source of instability, and if the Pakistan People's Party and Nawaz Sharif can not be meaningful allies, at least they can learn to be responsible adversaries. Pakistan managed a first yesterday by getting rid of a military ruler peacefully. But executive control of the army is still a long way off. By supporting the actions of a democratically elected government (albeit belatedly and reluctantly) the west is sending the army an important message: you may not love these people, but you have to live with them.</p> <p>The departed former army chief bequeaths his civilian successors an agenda laden with crises: inflation is running rampant; poverty is growing; the Taliban challenges the army for control of the tribal areas; militants carried out 56 suicide attacks last year; peace with India could unravel. Yet for all this, there is no alternative to civilian government and a functioning constitution. Pervez Musharraf tried being a benign ruler and ended up a benighted one.</p>",
  "<p>This has been out there for a while, but it's something more people should know. Which candidate is ahead in terms of financial contributions from active-duty US military personnel deployed abroad?</p> <p>Barack Obama, by <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2008/08/troops-deployed-abroad-give-61.html\">a six-to-one margin</a>. Undoubtedly, there are two simple explanations here: this subset is likely to be a bit more African American than the general population, and these are people who want to come home and think Obama is more likely to bring them there.</p> <p>But maybe they also think John McCain is a little crazy and will not only keep them in Iraq longer but also be more likely to send them to Iran or Georgia. Whatever the reason, the numbers are the numbers, and they don't lie. </p> <p>Of course if McCain led six-to-one among this group we'd be hearing a lot about it because it would fit with the established narrative. But it's also the Obama team's job to trumpet factoids like this. Tomorrow at his speech to the VFW might be a good place to start.</p>",
  "<p>I'm down with the general consensus that none of Barack Obama's available choices -- expected choices; there exists the chance that it'll be someone none of us have thought of -- is a game-changer. So I still think Evan Bayh is the best veep choice for these reasons:</p> <p>1. He's a boring, white, middle-American. I mean very boring and very middle-American and very white. For an \"exotic\" candidate, these are good things to have in a running mate. They reassure the average white voter that maybe Obama won't be turning the government over to Al Sharpton after all.</p> <p>2. Relatedly, look at <a href=\"http://www.twinstuff.com/wiki/images/d/db/Bayh_family2.jpg\">this picture</a> of Bayh's family. Then imagine the Obama and Bayh families on stages together, in Denver and beyond. It's p.r. gold.</p> <p>3. He was a big Clinton supporter, so it would be a fence-mending move.</p> <p>4. Indiana is in play, and it's a big prize -- 13 electoral votes. If Obama/Bayh could steal Indiana, it's very hard to see McCain winning. And Bayh is very popular there.</p> <p>5. He has experience and yet is still young enough to fit into the new generation mold.</p> <p>6. They like him in Broderland. Would play pretty well with the pundits.</p> <p>There are downsides, as there are to anyone. But I stack up the plusses and minuses of each of the remaining ones and I still come out with Bayh on top. But two or three others would be just fine, and people obsess over this way too much.</p>",
  "<p>It was not the way <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/18/pakistan\">Pervez Musharraf</a> would have wanted to go. Hugely unpopular at home and spurned by his traditional allies in the military, the Pakistani leader will be unlamented domestically. </p> <p>Although his fall is due partly to his own <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/18/pakistan1\">bumbling errors</a>, there is little doubt that his support for America's war on Islamist militants accounts for most of his unpopularity. Musharraf has been in the same position as a number of leaders around the world who have spent the years after 9/11 struggling to balance demands for cooperation with the US and the cost this exerts on their standing at home.</p> <p>Take the Kenyan president, Mwai Kibaki, for example. A little-remarked facet of his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mwai_Kibaki#2007_elections\">travails at the ballot box</a> late last year was the fact the Muslim population in that country solidly rejected him, thus tipping a close election in the opposition's favour.</p> <p>The president's Party of National Unity (PNU) was routed in areas with a large Muslim population. It did not secure a single parliamentary or civic seat in the predominantly Muslim coastal island of Mombasa and fared equally dismally in other Muslim areas. In all these regions, the Kibaki administration's solid cooperation with the US in confronting Islamic militancy was the central election issue.</p> <p>The Americans have long viewed Kenya as an important ally in their efforts to tackle extremism in the Horn of Africa. The US embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in 1998 highlighted this threat. And after the September 11 attacks, the Bush administration ramped up its efforts to use Kenya as a launching pad for its anti-terror operations in the region.</p> <p>Like Musharraf's regime, the Kibaki administration received millions of dollars in national security funds. And just as Pakistan gave the green light for US air force sorties in its restive North-West Frontier province, Kenyan bases are believed to have been used for repeated air raids in neighbouring Somalia, including <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7378502.stm\">one earlier this year</a> in which a leading militant was killed.</p> <p>Kenya, like Pakistan, has also handed over a number of militants to the US, such as Abdul Malik, a suspect in the 2002 attacks in a coastal resort in Mombasa, who was shipped off to Guant\u00e1namo Bay in March last year. This cooperation has come at considerable cost to the government.</p> <p>The most recent developments in Pakistan \u2013 and more pertinently the negative reaction at the ballot box last year \u2013 could well lead to a reappraisal of engagement with the US.</p> <p>In Kenya, local politicians have long counselled that a broader US investment in the capabilities of the corrupt and inefficient local police force would be more welcome than the current sole focus on terrorism. Few Kenyans lose sleep over terror attacks in the country but insecurity is a constant worry.</p> <p>American partnership in helping set up a forensic laboratory for local police \u2013 a longstanding request held up by lack of budgetary support \u2013 is one example that would have benefits for both the US and Kenya.</p> <p>Greater investment in training, and improved benefits such as insurance and healthcare, might help to curb corruption in the forces. This would simultaneously mean a more efficient anti-terror operation and possibly check the mysterious disappearing acts of suspects such as one of al-Qaida's most wanted men in Africa, <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorists/termohammed.htm\">Fazul Abdullah Mohammed</a>, who has repeatedly eluded capture despite being located several times by local police. Inevitable <a href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/oped/Opinion/-/440808/457090/-/3ko8o2/-/index.html\">whispers of complicity</a> have accompanied every reported escape.</p> <p>In the end, the US may have no real option but to refashion its relationship with allies if it is to expect continued cooperation in its anti-terror campaigns.</p> <p>Musharraf's ignominious exit and, to a lesser extent, Kibaki's troubles at the ballot box could mean that self-interest drives leaders to conclude that the unpopularity resulting from engagement with America is too high a price to pay.</p>",
  "<p>If you have been paying attention to the presidential pageant currently winding its way through the United States, then you're <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-08-17-mccain-adviser_N.htm\">probably aware</a> that Republican nominee John McCain is partial to the economic plight of <a href=\"http://mediamattersaction.org/freeride/lobbyists/\">Washington DC lobbyists</a>. So much so that he has <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/21/AR2008022101131_pf.html\">offered dozens of them stable employment</a> in the highest echelons of his campaign for the Oval Office.</p> <p>Many political prognosticators, including this columnist and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Real-McCain-Conservatives-Independents-Shouldnt/dp/0979482291\">author of a book</a> on the Arizona political pugilist, have long thought that his unseemly connection to a cabal of DC glitterati who have advocated for all manner of controversial clientele - from the needs of Blackwater mercenaries to the wants of the brutal <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobutu_Sese_Seko\">tyrant Mobuto Sese Seko</a> - would be McCain's undoing.</p> <p>But, as the late Democratic speaker of the US House of Representatives, Tip O'Neill, once put it: \"All politics is local\". It is that fact that may be not only the undoing of McCain but also of his political party.</p> <p>Let me explain.</p> <p>Recently it has <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-campaign8-2008aug08,0,6428374.story\">come to light</a> that McCain and his campaign manager-cum-lobbyist, Rick Davis, played a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/08/plouffe-mccains-dhl-deal_n_117790.html\">lead role</a> in facilitating a deal that will likely lead to the foreign-owned package delivery service DHL relocating up to 10,000 jobs out of Southern Ohio. Davis was paid almost $200,000 to lobby for the deal, and McCain, who he lobbied, fought for it in the Senate.</p> <p>And this could be the issue that costs McCain the presidency and his party Congressional seats for years to come. Ohioans have suffered through years of job losses due to trade, tax and regulatory bamboozling that have sent manufacturing and other core industries to \"outsource\" workers. It has led to not only a rational fear of job losses here (I live in the great state of Ohio), but an equally rational resentment of the money men and their political pawns in Washington who view a 30-year career on the assembly line as just a statistic. To fully appreciate this one need only look at a Quinnipiac poll in June this year, where 81% of Ohioans have a negative view of the state's economy.</p> <p>People in this part of the country are - to quote <a href=\"http://www.americanrhetoric.com/MovieSpeeches/moviespeechnetwork2.html\">Howard Beale from the movie Network</a> - \"mad as hell and they're not going to take it anymore.\" And, to paraphrase a slogan for Las Vegas: what happens in southern Ohio doesn't simply stay in southern Ohio. It affects how people in other parts of the state, not to mention Missouri, Indiana, Michigan and Iowa - swing states all - view this election.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/08/plouffe-mccains-dhl-deal_n_117790.html\">Obama campaign</a>, sensing this, has released <a href=\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/08/15/1268992.aspx\">television and radio ads</a> in the Cincinnati market here (which reaches beyond Ohio's borders), pointing out John McCain's tawdry role in this affair. The <a href=\"http://blog.aflcio.org/2008/08/11/mccain-should-fire-lobbyist-who-killed-ohio-jobs/\">AFL-CIO, sensing a similar opportunity</a>, has sent mailers out to Ohioans that do the same.</p> <p>What makes this even a bigger deal is that Ohio, considered one of two key swing states (Florida being the other one) and a large state (the seventh largest), has gone through a political sea-change over the past few years. After a string of corruption scandals rocked Republican officeholders and financiers in the state - sending a handful to prison - <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/us/politics/08ohio.html\">Democrats were swept into power in 2006</a>, picking up the Ohio governor's mansion, a congressional seat, a host of other executive positions (such as state treasurer and secretary of state) and seven state house seats. President Bush's anthrax-like popularity, the war in Iraq and job losses have only made matters worse for the GOP.</p> <p>So McCain might be the least of their worries. Five Republican congressional seats in Ohio are vulnerable to Democratic takeover. More importantly, the state house in Ohio is ripe for Democratic picking, as Republicans can only afford to lose three seats and still hold their majority.</p> <p>Why do I grant control of Ohio's state house such outsized importance? Because it will play an enormous role in redrawing US congressional districts in Ohio in 2010 - as is done in each state every 10 years - along with the governor and state senate. The Ohio state senate will likely still be held by the GOP at that time, but if Democrats have the governor's mansion and the state house, they could create a map that would turn about a dozen congressional seats to being solidly Democratic - through locking in victories by candidates this year with more Democratic districts and eliminating two Republican seats outright (the state has lost population, so a two-seat decline is expected). This could play a big role in ensuring Democratic control of congress for the coming decade.</p> <p>And the final cloud, in what is becoming the perfect storm, is the unmasking of how John McCain and his campaign manager are beholden to corporate interests, whatever they pretend when they are swinging through Ohio on a campaign stop.</p> <p>Can you think of a better definition of poetic justice?</p>",
  "<p>A senior adviser to John McCain is accusing NBC news of \"irresponsible journalism\" and bias against his candidate, a move designed to build on the Republican's well-received performance during a joint weekend appearance with Barack Obama.</p> <p>In a letter to NBC news president Steve Capus, McCain campaign manager Rick Davis asked for a meeting to discuss his \"deep concerns about the news standards and level of objectivity\" at the network.</p> <p>Davis chastised NBC analyst Andrea Mitchell for remarking that Obama aides were trying to quell talk of a McCain victory at Saturday night's Saddleback church forum, where the two candidates were quizzed on personal and moral concerns before a Christian evangelical audience.</p> <p>\"The Obama people must feel that he didn't do quite as well as they wanted to in that context,\" Mitchell said yesterday on the Meet the Press programme, \"because what they are putting out privately is that McCain \u2026 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to Obama\".<br> The suggestion that McCain had somehow cheated at Saddleback \u2013 although not endorsed by Mitchell and labelled as an opinion in the Obama camp \u2013 left Davis irate.</p> <p>\"We are extremely disappointed to see that the level of objectivity at NBC news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated, partisan claims in order to undercut John McCain,\" Davis wrote in his letter to Capus, sent late yesterday.</p> <p>Davis's letter marks the third confrontation this year between NBC and a high-profile politician. Hillary Clinton backers accused the network of pro-Obama bias during the Democratic primary race this spring, and Clinton herself protested one NBC anchor's quip that daughter Chelsea was being \"pimped out\" on her mother's behalf.</p> <p>The White House also complained to NBC this spring about the editing of a taped interview with George Bush, suggesting that the president's words had been taken out of context to portray animus against Obama on US-Iran relations.</p> <p>The McCain-NBC dispute turns on whether the Republican nominee was able to overhear some of the questions that Saddleback forum moderator Rick Warren posed to Obama, who preceded McCain on stage at the televised event.</p> <p>Warren, a popular evangelical pastor, told the audience that McCain was in a \"cone of silence\" during Obama's interview. </p> <p>But news reports after the forum revealed the expression to be a figure of speech, leading some Obama supporters to question whether McCain had an advantage by anticipating some of the questions.</p> <p>In fact, the website Politico.com reported today that both candidates had an advance warning of certain questions Warren asked.</p> <p>Aiming to capitalise on the positive response to McCain's Saddleback performance, aides to the Republican nominee continue to maintain that he was in a private motorcade during Obama's interview with Warren and did not listen to the forum broadcast.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336701299\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p><br>Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, today bowed to intense pressure and resigned ahead of impeachment proceedings due to start this week.</p> <p>Musharraf appeared live on national television just after 1pm local time (8am BST) in an address that lasted for over an hour. Towards the finish, as the former army commander put an end to almost nine years in power, his voice trembled and he appeared to have tears in his eyes.</p> <p>\"If I was doing this just for myself, I might have chosen a different course,\" he said, wearing a western suit and tie but speaking in Urdu. \"But I put Pakistan first, as always.</p> <p>\"Whether I win or lose the impeachment, the dignity of the nation would be damaged, the office of the president harmed.\"</p> <p>It is likely that Musharraf stepped down as a part of a western-mediated deal between the president and the coalition government, according to which all charges against him will be dropped in return for his resignation.</p> <p>Britain's foreign secretary, David Miliband, said the move marked the end of a \"critical period\" in Pakistan's history and called for quick elections to find a successor.</p> <p>\"The Musharraf years yielded significant dividends\u2026 It is important to highlight President Musharraf's commitment to tackle terrorism, to promote dialogue with India, especially over Kashmir, and to root out corruption,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I look forward to the early election of a new president in Pakistan to take forward the important shared work that binds our two countries together.\"</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, praised Musharraf as a \"friend to the United States and one of the world's most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism\".</p> <p>She said the US would work with the new leaders and impress on them the need to stem \"the growth of extremism\".</p> <p>Although it was believed Musharraf resigned as part of a deal to avoid prosecution, it was a humiliation nevertheless for the ex-army chief to have to submit to the very politicians he hated. But he admitted he had been left with no choice.</p> <p>\"Even if I beat this impeachment, relations between the presidency and the government can never be fixed,\" he said. \"Pillars of the state \u2013 parliament and the judiciary \u2013 would be harmed and, God forbid, the army might have been dragged in.\" He said he wanted the people to be his judge.</p> <p>The foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, said leaders of the ruling coalition were discussing whether to prosecute Musharraf in court on the impeachment charges.</p> <p>Qureshi would not say whether Musharraf might be granted a safe exit; there has been speculation he might go into exile in Saudi Arabia or Turkey.</p> <p>\"That is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership,\" said Qureshi, a member of the Pakistan People's party (PPP), in a television interview with Dawn News.</p> <p>The Pakistan Muslim League-N, the second-biggest party in the coalition government with the PPP, said Musharraf should be tried for treason, which carries a maximum sentence of death. Its leader, Nawaz Sharif, whom Musharraf deposed as prime minister in a coup in October 1999, was the prime mover behind the impeachment.<br>\"The crimes of Musharraf against the nation, against the judiciary, against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual,\" said the party's spokesman, Ahsan Iqbal.</p> <p>Musharraf, who was a near-absolute ruler until he stepped down as army chief in November last year and held elections this February, did not leave without first launching into an impassioned and lengthy defence of his record. He said the allegations against him were \"lies\".</p> <p>Musharraf laid the blame for Pakistan's economic crisis squarely on the current government, saying that just eight months ago the economy was booming and Pakistan was regarded as one of the next great emerging market success stories.</p> <p>\"When I took over, nine years ago, this country was on the verge of being declared a terrorist state, on the verge of becoming a failed state,\" he said. \"The challenges of the last nine years have been greater than any in Pakistan's history, yet I have met those challenges.\"</p> <p>Celebrations broke out across the country after Musharraf's announcement, with people dancing and handing out sweets. \"Thank God he's resigned. The country will do much better now. It's a victory for the people,\" said Mohammad Ilyas, 30, in Karachi.</p> <p>Lawyers, who have spearheaded an anti-Musharraf campaign since he tried to sack the chief justice last year, stormed out of courts in the south-eastern city of Multan on hearing of his resignation, shouting: \"Down with the American stooge.\" \"It's just like I'm celebrating my wedding,\" said one lawyer, Malik Naveed.</p> <p>It is not yet clear who the next president will be. According to the constitution, the chairman of the senate, Mohammadmian Soomro, will become acting president until a new president is elected within 30 days for a five-year term.</p> <p>Most members of the coalition government did not want to go through the trauma of impeachment proceedings, hoping the threat of prosecution would be enough to persuade the president to go. Musharraf held out for almost two weeks after the announcement that the government had decided to impeach him.</p> <p>Reza Rabbani, a leading PPP member, said: \"This is the first time in Pakistan's political history where you have the people winning against establishment institutions.\"</p>",

  "<p>For sheer shameless and oleaginous self-regard, few documents can top <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12594.html\">this letter</a> the McCain campaign has sent to NBC requesting a meeting with the head of NBC news to complain about Andrea Mitchell and allegedly slanted coverage.</p> <p>This is so cynical it's beyond belief. And the sick part is, it'll probably work.</p>",
  "<p>When people start running to be president, we learn new things about them. The amount and intensity of exposure \u2013 the fact that suddenly we are subjected to their thinking on every conceivable issue and non-issue \u2013 makes this inevitable. As a result of this our opinions change. We either like them more or less than at the beginning, but rarely in just the same measure.</p> <p>I've been surprised at how much less I like John McCain than I did a year ago. Granted, I think the Republican party is an affliction and, as I've made clear for a long time, I want Barack Obama to be the next president. But even given that, the political analyst part of my brain can put all that aside and see other strengths and weaknesses (and we'll circle back to this point).</p> <p>John McCain is a jerk. Alternately a bully and a whiner, and a bald-faced liar to perhaps a greater degree than even George Bush and Dick Cheney, McCain is running a stupid and mephitic campaign that insults even Americans of average intelligence virtually every day.</p> <p>He has pandered to the right-wing to a degree that the word \"shameless\" can't possibly begin to describe. He has flip-flopped repeatedly, on <a href=\"http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/flipflops\">taxes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=3483eb20-9228-4700-9557-57a47a676e0b\">abortion</a> and <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200805210004\">many other matters</a>. And he quite obviously changed his position on offshore drilling in order <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/08/john-mccain-hes.html \">to raise pots of money</a> from oil interests. Period.</p> <p>He lies with abandon. He's not an idiot, so he has to know very well, for example, that offshore drilling won't affect the price of gasoline (petrol) for many years to come. Yet he repeatedly implies or says outright to audiences that if we just opened up the coasts to drilling, prices would start to come down.</p> <p>Most surprisingly of all to me, he has demonstrated over and over his lack of a grasp of, and in many cases even a passing interest in, the details of policy. Here is a man who's been a national legislator for a quarter-century. He has clearly been interested in a few things, mostly having to do with military and foreign policy, and to a certain extent energy policy. But there are dozens more realms with which responsible <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solon\">Solons</a> ought to have acquainted themselves over 25 years. McCain seems to have glided through the Senate without even bothering to learn very much at all about fiscal and economic policy, healthcare, social policy (which is an umbrella rubric covering a dozen different things) and a lot of other topics. His campaign, and his partisans, accuse Obama of being a lightweight. But in truth, McCain is the policy lightweight.</p> <p>And finally, on his area of supposed expertise, he's demonstrated that he would uphold the Dick Cheney tradition. He talks very tough on Iran and gives disquieting indications that he'd seriously consider a preemptive strike on their nuclear facilities, even though experts repeatedly stress that a massive strike would be required to penetrate even a small percentage of Iran's processing and storage facilities. And on Russia, his policies \u2013 force them <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWihxPJT8-8&amp;feature=related\">out of the G8</a>, are you serious? \u2013 would rekindle a new cold war with a nation that still, lest we forget, sits on upwards of 12,000 nuclear warheads (by comparison, China has 400).</p> <p>And on top of all this, he runs ads featuring Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, and far worse, and then lies and <a href=\"http://www.wikio.com/politics/election_2008/the_mccain_campaign/steve_schmidt\">denies he's running a negative campaign</a>. He's just a joke of a candidate.</p> <p>And yet, the analytical side of my brain knows that McCain has won the pre-convention summer phase of the campaign. He's cut into Obama's lead. Obama's win percentage at fivethirtyeight.com \u2013 that is, the likelihood in their estimation that he's going to win the election \u2013 has been above 60% most of the campaign. This morning <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/\">it's at 56.9%</a>. State-by-state, Obama still looks good, but enough states are close enough to make Obama partisans nervous.</p> <p>More than that, the McCain campaign has established a negative story line about Obama \u2013 that he's shallow, just a celebrity, and so on \u2013 that is sticking, a little. It's a blustery lie. But blustery lies often work.</p> <p>In the meantime, the Obama campaign hasn't established a negative story line about McCain. It's not an easy thing to do. His reputation, thanks to years of fawning media, is so ingrained and so at odds with the man we've seen on the trail thus far that arguing to voters that McCain is in fact a superficial flip-flopping panderer would just make no sense. And the McCain campaign would just respond, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/18/us/politics/18mccain.html?_r=1&amp;ref=politics&amp;oref=slogin\">as it has</a>, by saying, \"How dare they say that about a former prisoner of war\". And then the media will just talk about that all over again.</p> <p>So Obama has a challenge here. An election about his alleged superficiality is a tough one for him to win. An election about what the Republicans have done to the country, and why McCain will be more of the same, is a lot easier to win. He's still ahead, but his campaign should have spent its summer vacation establishing the latter contest more forcefully.</p>",

He now says all Russian troops must clear out of Georgia and says he will call a full EU council if this does not happen.</p> <p>The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5irjdfQdHqnS5LyXe2laHu-TxW8zQ\">visited Tbilisi</a> and said Georgia will join Nato. Die Zeit's weekend headline was \"The Russian Danger\" and its publisher Helmut Schmidt is sending a clear signal to the pro-Russian German foreign office that it is time the scales fell from its eyes.</p> <p>As Sir Roderick Braithwaite, the astute former ambassador in Moscow and a man sympathetic to Russians pointed out some time ago, Russia has done far more invading than it has been invaded. Napoleon and Hitler failed to conquer Moscow but Russian armies \u2013 Tsarist and Soviet \u2013 have occupied every European capital east of the Rhine.</p> <p>Hence the very different perspective on the Russian air-sea-land assault on a UN member state from EU nations closer to Moscow. Barely noticed in the crisis last week were the visits by the presidents of Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Ukraine to <a href=\"http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/21068/\">stand alongside President Saakashvili</a> as a gesture of solidarity.</p> <p>The Russian response was to threaten Poland with nuclear weapons as the terrified Poles <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/15/europe/missile.php\">signed an agreement</a> with America on kinetic (unarmed) missile defence shield bases. When Carl Bildt, Sweden's experienced and balanced foreign minister, expressed concern about Russia's behaviour, Moscow's response was to threaten a naval re-militarisation of the Baltic.</p> <p>Future trouble looms over Ukraine's sovereign coast line on the Crimean Black Sea where the Russian warm-water fleet is stationed.</p> <p>President Sarkozy's remarks that Russia had some rights in Georgia sent a chill down the spine of Baltic states which have Russian speaking citizens, installed after Stalin's invasion of these small countries in 1940. Finland, which fought a war with Russia in 1940, shivers at what the new Putin doctrine might mean.</p> <p>The huge Polish diaspora in North America, Britain and elsewhere will see all its atavistic fears about Russia resurface. It is unlikely that Obama or McCain will risk alienating this voting bloc by adopting anything other than hard, harsh language on Russia \u2013 just as Sarkozy and Merkel have had to harden their tone and start to speak more like David Miliband, who is being reported in the continental press as being authoritative and tough on Russia in contrast to more uncritical lines from some European foreign ministers.</p> <p>Putin may have thought that sweeping the Georgian pawn off the board was the end of the game. Alas, it is is only the beginning, and Britain cannot betray Poland and its fellow EU and Nato allies as Chamberlain did in the 1930s.</p>",
  "<h2>Why did Pervez Musharraf resign today?</h2> <p>In a word, politics. Ever since the country's elections in February, Musharraf's position has been in doubt. His fate was sealed when the leaders of the two biggest parties joined hands in recent weeks, saying they were determined to get rid of the former army chief.<br> Asif Ali Zardari, the husband of the late Benazir Bhutto and leader of the Pakistan People's party, and Nawaz Sharif, the head of the powerful Pakistan Muslim League-N, who was ousted by Musharraf in 1999, had signalled they were determined to finish off the president \u2013 with a trial through parliament. The country's ruling coalition had prepared impeachment charges, accusing Musharraf of violations of the constitution and misconduct. </p> <p>Musharraf had few cards to play. Already deeply unpopular, he faced a lengthy legal battle to turn the tide of opinion his way. While disputing the charges, he resigned, saying he was putting Pakistan first.</p> <h2>Did he have any allies?</h2> <p>Too few to count. The ruling coalition needed 295 votes out of 442 in a joint sitting of both houses of parliament to impeach him. A series of votes in provincial assemblies killed Musharraf's best legal arguments, leaving the president facing an unprecedented loss of public confidence. The army had long since washed it hands of the president \u2013 aware that it might lose public faith if associated with an unpopular president.<br>  </p> <h2>What are the roots of Musharraf's troubles?</h2> <p>The popular anger can be traced back to December 2004 when he announced he was going back on his pledge to step down as army chief. This convinced many democrats in Pakistan that he could not be trusted. </p> <p>It was the president's decision in March 2007 to suspend Pakistan's supreme court chief justice, Iftikhar Chaudhry, on allegations of misconduct that ignited a popular revolt. Lawyers rallied behind the top judge and Musharraf's popularity began to plummet as a pro-democracy campaign started.</p> <h2>Did the lawyers' movement bring him down?</h2> <p>The lawyers were a key partner with the politicians in finishing off Musharraf. In a controversial move last year, the president declared a state of emergency. In February's parliamentary elections his political opponents gained power.</p> <h2>Was this revenge for the assassination of Benazir Bhutto?</h2> <p>Many in Pakistan say Musharraf has blood on his hands. Zardari was imprisoned for six years, then permitted to leave the country to join his wife, Benazir Bhutto, in exile in Dubai. She returned last October to contest the elections. Zardari only returned after his wife's assassination in December.</p> <p>Bhutto had accused Musharraf of an assassination attempt last October. When she was killed two months later, many Pakistanis blamed the president.</p> <h2>What about the \"war on terror\"?</h2> <p>The west has lost its most important ally. Musharraf was widely seen as having attempted to rein in the terror groups in Pakistan \u2013 supporting the \"war on terror\" in Afghanistan and withdrawing support from the Islamist jihad in Indian Kashmir. </p> <p>Last July, after a week-long siege, Musharraf ordered troops to storm the Red Mosque in Islamabad to crush a Taliban-style movement. At least 105 people were killed. </p> <p>The United States says Pakistan's leadership is a Pakistani matter, but the White House must be worried about future cooperation.</p> <h2>Will the army return to oust politicians in revenge?</h2> <p>Unlikely. The army is hugely unpopular at home for fighting on Washington's side in the \"war on terror\". Likewise, it has been fingered for protecting the Taliban. The army has lost an estimated 2,000 men fighting extremists in the tribal areas and the armed forces have been targeted by suicide bombers.</p> <h2>Where will Musharraf go?</h2> <p>Nobody is sure. Some jokers have suggested he return to Delhi, the place of his birth. Others say he would prefer going to Turkey, a Muslim country with strong secular traditions where he spent much of his childhood. The United States - where his son lives - would probably take him in. Saudi Arabia, with a history of sheltering former dictators, would make him feel very comfortable. But Musharraf's own \"royalist\" allies says he will stay in Pakistan \u2013 perhaps in his luxurious bungalow being built in Islamabad.</p> <h2>Who will be the next president of Pakistan?</h2> <p>The president is elected by the four provincial assemblies and the national parliament. Many think the role might be reduced to a ceremonial one. If the president retained substantial powers, Zardari might want the position, although he has has hinted the next president may be a woman. </p> <p>Analysts speculate that the ethnic Pashtun leader Asfandayr Wali Khan is a frontrunner because he is liberal and it would be a sign of national unity.</p>",

  "<p>The US Federal Election Commission (FEC) is being urged to investigate whether Wal-Mart broke the law by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/11/us.union\">holding mandatory meetings for employees</a> where Democratic legislative proposals were attacked.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.aflcio.org/aboutus/\">American Federation of Labour and Congress of Industrial Organisations (AFL-CIO)</a> - which represents over 50 unions - the Change to Win labour group, American Rights at Work - a worker advocacy group - and <a href=\"http://www.WakeUpWalMart.com\">WakeUpWalMart.com</a> have together filed a complaint with the FEC.</p> <p>The quartet claim Wal-Mart broke the law by disparaging the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA), a law that will almost certainly be enacted if Senator Barack Obama is elected president. The law makes it easier for workers to organise a union, a situation that Wal-Mart vehemently opposes, and which Republicans are also against.</p> <p>\"If an employer can manipulate or intimidate its employees into voting one way or another, it seriously undermines political democracy,\" Stewart Acuff, a spokesperson for the AFL-CIO, told theguardian.com.</p> <p>It is a violation of federal election law for an employer to try to manipulate its employees' votes. Wal-Mart has denied the allegations and analysis shows that in this election cycle its political action committee has split donations almost evenly between the parties.</p> <p>Wal-Mart spokesman David Tovar said that if anyone representing the company \"gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote, they were wrong and acting without approval\".</p> <p>\"We believe that if the FEC looks into this, they will find what we've known all along, that we did nothing wrong,\" Tovar said in an e-mailed statement to AP.</p> <p>The EFCA will allow workers to join or form a union as easily as the employer can join the chamber of commerce - simply by signing a card or petition. And when more than 50% of workers have signed up, the union is established. Currently, secret ballots are used.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal has said it has received <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121867433681738991.html?mod=sphere_ts&amp;mod=sphere_wd\">a recording of a Wal-Mart meeting</a> where the company tells employees that their wages may be reduced to minimum wage for up to three months before a contract is negotiated; that union authorisation cards violate workers' right to privacy by including their social security numbers on them; and that if a small unit within a store voted to unionise, the entire store would be unionised.</p> <p>Lawyers told the newspaper that those are inaccurate interpretations of US labour laws in general and the EFCA in particular, and could be interpreted as a violation of labour law.</p>",
  "<p>He kept the suspense going until the very end. He had built schools, clinics, irrigation projects, he said. He was innocent, chaos threatened. But finally, he had decided to go. </p> <p>Pervez Musharraf always liked to play the commando: decisive, daring, the master tactician. His first appearance on the nation's televisions after taking power in 1999 was at 3am, when the jammed single national TV channel cleared to reveal him in commando fatigues. </p> <p>He was never falsely modest, but the serial misjudgments that led eventually to his resignation today were those of a military man with limited understanding of politics and of the social trends that, in part, his own policies had initiated. </p> <p>So what happens now? First an interim president will be appointed, the chairman of the senate. Then a new election will be held for the post, with votes cast by the two houses of the national assembly and the members of Pakistan's four provincial assemblies too. </p> <p>Candidates and campaign are likely to be the subject of frantic negotiations, horse trading and political infighting, and will almost certainly see a new arrangement of power between the two major coalition partners: Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-N and Asil Asif Zardari's Pakistan People's party. </p> <p>A new series of constitutional amendments to restrict the power of the president, based on the original 1973 constitution which gives much more power to the office of prime minister, is likely. As ever in Pakistan, the various legal and political manoeuvres over the next months will be complicated, opaque and will obsess the English language media and the elite of Islamabad, Karachi and Lahore \u2013 particularly the significant number among them who welcomed the coup and supported Musharraf for a long time. </p> <p>Interest in the villages and small towns in which two-thirds of the population live will be more limited, despite the effects of the new private television chains. </p> <p>Musharraf's problems are far from over. Though covered for his military coup in 1999 by a constitutional amendment, he has no such protection for the state of emergency he declared last autumn, bar some contested court judgments, and is thus going to be open to prosecution as long as he remains in Pakistan. There are also a lot of people \u2013 mainly Islamic militants \u2013 who want to kill him. </p> <p>For the moment, Musharraf looks likely to be spared the courts. Some will regret that Pakistan has been spared a long and drawn-out battle to hold Musharraf to account. \"An impeachment would have taken a long time but would have shown that coup-makers can be held accountable for their actions and set an important precedent,\" said Professor Osama Siddique, a constitutional expert at Lahore University of Management Sciences. </p> <p>Yet the key factor in Musharraf's today's decision, one friend said bitterly, was his \"hanging out to dry\" by the army. Another way of looking at it is that General Ashfaq Kayani - who replaced the president as head of Pakistan's military when Musharraf belatedly became a civilian leader last year - has decided to restore the army's battered reputation domestically and internationally by withdrawing to the role of \"guarantor\" of Pakistani democracy, rather than being its dominant actor. </p> <p>Along with the positive role played in the February general elections, where Kayani none too subtly warned Musharraf off any attempt at manipulation, the overall impression now that the president has gone is that this particular cycle of army rule has ended. There are shades here of 1988 when, following the sudden death of General Zia ul-Haq after 11 years of dictatorial rule, the military top brass allowed a relatively smooth transition to civilian government. </p> <p>Benazir Bhutto won the subsequent elections. The bad news is that Musharraf's passing is unlikely to make much difference to the raging militancy in the west, nor revive the flagging economy. Civilian leaders are unlikely to be able to influence any elements of the security establishment that are assisting Taliban militants in Afghanistan, nor are they necessarily better placed to deal with the many structural problems that both fuel the militancy and weaken Pakistan's ability to combat it. </p> <p>At least, however, the charge of being Washington's stooge will be harder to make against Musharraf's successor \u2013 or that of being a closet Islamist. Nine years after that first speech to the nation, Musharraf appeared in a bank manager's dark suit, blue shirt and tie. But the ex-president's problem was always that he could never shake off the stain of khaki. This, at least, is one thing he still shares with his country.</p>",
  "<p>For good or for ill, Russia is back. And this great power means business. The reasons for Georgia's decision to \"restore constitutional order\" in South Ossetia through military means are best known to the man who ordered it: <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/12/georgia.russia7 \">President Mikhail Saakashvili</a>. But it was always wishful thinking to believe that mother Russia would sit on her hands while its \"peacekeepers\" were under fire across its immediate border. Russia's decision to mount an armed response was predictable: so too was its disproportionate severity. Russia's overwhelming victory has allowed it to avenge its post-cold war \"humiliation\" \u2013 expanded Nato membership in the Caucuses is less likely, Russian strategic influence in the region has deepened, and the west has proven powerless in the face of events.</p> <p>That does not mean that the world must now abandon Georgia to whatever fate Vladimir Putin chooses \u2013 and make no mistake, this conflict has demonstrated that he is still very much in charge. Instead, the international community should engage with both Georgia and Russia and press for a fair and lasting peace settlement, and the European Union is ideally placed to lead that effort. President Sarkozy is not a man <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/12/georgia.russia4 \">famed for his diplomacy</a>, but he deserves credit for the speed with which the EU's French presidency has persuaded both Georgia and Russia to agree to a six-point plan for peace. Whether it will stand the test of time is doubtful but it remains the best available foundation on which to build. There are two specific reasons why the EU should lead that process forward.</p> <p>First, Europe is the only player that can be seen as an honest broker. Saakashvili has close personal connections to the neocons in Washington, and the US government has backed the Georgian regime to the hilt, providing its leadership with political backing and providing its army with military training. Russia's brutal retaliation in South Ossetia was designed to show how little that support means: for America to broker peace is therefore unthinkable. By contrast, Europe's initial ambivalence might prove the unlikely key to its success. Post-Soviet member states are more inclined to lay blame for the conflict at Russia's door; others, including Italy, have expressed an opposing view. By acknowledging that there are different opinions over responsibility for this conflict, the EU can better adopt a position of neutrality in its negotiations.</p> <p>Second, Europe will engage the Russian bear, rather than bait it. Both US presidential candidates have suggested that Russia's response in South Ossetia should reflect negatively on its application to join the WTO. The Republican candidate, John McCain, has even mooted the idea of <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/11/johnmccain.barackobama \">booting Russia out of the G8</a>. That is folly. Senator McCain is certainly old enough to remember that it was engagement with the Soviet Union that helped defuse cold war tensions \u2013 notably through the Helsinki process of the 1970s, and the dialogue between Gorbachev and Reagan in the 1980s. Membership of the WTO and the G8 are mechanisms through which to engage Russia today and help to steer her on to the path of accountability, openness and democracy. By isolating Russia, political leverage will be lost and hostilities will deepen. </p> <p>Playing to the gallery of populist opinion is short-sighted but inevitable at this point in America's election cycle. But not all EU member states have resisted that temptation either. Notably, Britain's foreign secretary, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7557887.stm\">David Miliband</a>, and the Conservative leader, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/georgia/2547611/David-Cameron-What-happens-in-Georgia-directly-affects-us.html\">David Cameron</a>, have engaged in a race to the bottom with each determined to use tougher, more anti-Russian rhetoric than the other. It is an unedifying spectacle that proves their mutual lack of suitability for the job that they are really squabbling over. But the EU as an entity is more mature: it is institutionally inclined to dialogue, inclusion and policy that reflects the shades of grey that are inherent to this conflict. That is a must for disentangling the constitutional complexities that have dogged Georgia since the fall of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>There is a great deal of work to be done in order to reach agreement. Success will depend on genuine commitment from both Russia and Georgia \u2013 and that is by no means guaranteed. It is possible that Russia will, ultimately, adopt the 21st century equivalent of the <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brezhnev_Doctrine\">Brezhnev doctrine</a> and impose a unilateral outcome in its sphere of influence, undermining Europe in the process. That's the risk. But by leading the effort to find an acceptable solution, and working with the UN, OSCE, and America too, Europe can minimise that risk and show that it too means business.</p>",
