  "<p>Rarely has a figure emerged so suddenly and spectacularly on to the American political scene as Sarah Palin. Equally rare is the way she has since been buried by an avalanche of scandal and mistakes.</p> <p>From the shock of being chosen as John McCain's running mate and her stunning speech at the Republican National Convention to the almost daily update of gaffes, it has been a rollercoaster ride.</p> <p>Palin brought things that had rarely or never been seen before on a presidential campaign. Moose-hunting. Her husband Todd as Alaska's First Dude. Her supporters proudly touting lipstick as a political weapon. Hockey moms and pitbulls. But away from the gimmicks, there was the historic nature of her place as a woman on the Republican ticket.</p> <p>Yet, after almost two months on the campaign trail, her net impact is the greatest surprise: zero. Palin has reverted to the traditional role of the Vice-President. It is the one that Joe Biden has played for the Democrats to considerably less attention. That role is to be an attack dog. 'In the end, her impact is going to be neutral. The base loves her, but she is not going to bring many people on board for McCain who aren't there already,' said Professor Tracy Osborn, a political scientist and expert on women in politics at the University of Iowa.</p> <p>For a while, though, everything about Palin seemed fresh. She was young, attractive, forthright and delivered a convention speech as if wielding a stiletto heel. Suddenly McCain's campaign had rock-star quality. Thousands flocked to see her. </p> <p>But the wheels came off fairly quickly. The media obsession with Palin had a dark side, too. Every little obscure spat of her time in Alaska (a state which has quirky domestic politics at the best of times) was magnified. The greatest was Troopergate. It should have remained a minor staffing controversy in the frozen north. Did Palin use her powers to sack someone who refused to fire a state trooper Palin's family was feuding with? Who knows? But the issue refuses to die. On Friday, she gave a deposition under oath as a second inquiry took off. </p> <p>There have been even more colourful scandals. There was the unplanned pregnancy of her teenage daughter. The disastrous interview with news anchor Katie Couric, in which Palin stumbled over the simplest of questions. In the harsh glare of the campaign spotlight a picture of a bumbling Palin emerged that scared more people than it inspired. </p> <p>In the latest poll, 55 per cent of Americans believed her unprepared to be President. On Friday, the Los Angeles Times claimed Palin abused her position as governor to promote friends, their relatives and financial donors, sometimes with little regard for their qualifications. It said that more than 100 appointments went to campaign donors or their relatives. </p> <p>Equally headline-worthy was last week's media obsession with her wardrobe after it was revealed that the Republican party had spent $150,000 on designer clothes for her. The New York Times (which has now endorsed Barack Obama) also reported that Amy Strozzi, Palin's make-up artist, had briefly been the highest-paid operative in the Republican campaign after netting $22,800 for two weeks' work in October. Palin has reacted angrily to those stories, decrying a media that pays attention to her appearance in a way that it does not for the male candidates. </p> <p>But the media seems worried that if the Republicans lose the election Palin might drop off the radar. To keep her flame alive some have even speculated Palin may have a television career ahead of her. 'I think she's a perfect fit as a TV host, stirring passions on both sides,' said Michael Levine, a Hollywood PR expert.</p> <p>But the pundits should stop fretting. Most serious analysis still sees a strong political future for Palin within the Republican party. She still has the backing of the powerful evangelical grassroots. Time will help to erase the memory of her gaffes. She will become a smoother and more experienced politician. </p> <p>'She has a bright future ahead of her,' said Osborn, who predicted that she might end up in the Senate when an Alaskan seat becomes available. Others see a possible 2012 presidential run. Whatever happens, Palin will not be returning to the political obscurity from which she so suddenly emerged.</p>",
  "<p>When I was in the band in the Nineties I lived in Chorlton, Manchester. </p> <p>I went to more parties then because I was younger (I'm 45 now), but I've gone right off them. So I spend a lot of time at home on the farm near Sutton, a village outside Macclesfield. </p> <p>I feel excited at the prospect of coming in here to work in the morning. I always say you can feel the weather in this room because the windows are huge and if it's not too dark I work till 6pm. I moved in 12 years ago, but only converted this building - a tin and timber structure next to the main house - in 2004, which is when I started painting full time. I don't know why I didn't have my own studio sooner. Having a dedicated space has increased the output of my work. Before that I spent my creative life working in temporary environments - on my parents' kitchen table, in the box room of my first house or in rehearsal rooms. </p> <p>This building was originally used for sheep. A shepherd used to keep his caravan in here in April during lambing season, and his wool here when the sheep were sheared in July. He rented the land from the previous owner and I got to know him really well. When he retired I said he could carry on using the land for nothing.</p> <p>My mum would say that I chose to live near Sutton because it's where my great grandfather lived and that once he famously walked 10 miles into Manchester from here to find work. Maybe that's true, but I also came here because Jamie, my 17-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, lives nearby (I also have a son, Dillon, who is 10). I share the farm with my wife Sophie and our three daughters Martha (5) and three-year-old twins Mary and Dora. But the main reason I moved here is that I fell in love with the view - especially the fact you can see Macclesfield Forest.</p> <p>\u2022 John Squire's exhibition, Noise, is at SW1 Gallery until 1 November (<a href=\"http://www.johnsquire.com\">johnsquire.com</a>)</p>",
  "<p>A month after my 29th birthday I decided to stop having sex. I'd had plenty of sexual partners (30 or so), a sprinkling of one-night stands, a fair balance between 'making love' and 'just' sex. I had no hang-ups about it - indeed, it was getting better as I got older. I'd had serious boyfriends, and I'd had many more less serious ones whom I'd dated for a few weeks or months. I'd had my requisite lesbian experiments - it's practically a 21st-century requirement.</p> <p>But on the cusp of my thirties I suddenly realised I didn't want to keep racking up the numbers, continuing on the same path I was on. I was over sexual liberation, a feminist doctrine that had gained us the right to enjoy our sexuality, and by extension promiscuity, without repudiation. I felt like dating had become a burlesque comedy where we all pretended we were emotionless and cool - when in actual fact dating was a fruitless, haunting quest for a snatch of intimacy, a warm body, a less-lonely night. Sex had become an obligation, not a choice. I wanted sex to be, quite simply, special again.</p> <p>I made the decision to stop having sex for exactly one year back in April. I work for Senator Obama's campaign for president and my announcement to colleagues in the office - a bunch of twentysomething Ivy League Grads - was met with gentle derision, teasing about 'promise rings' and snide comments about conservative attitudes towards sex, promoting abstinence over informed education. I was either on the path to becoming part of the Christian Right, they joked, or I was plain masochistic. Even my friends regarded me with curiosity, and a little awe. 'Do you enjoy sex?' they probed.</p> <p>Yes, definitely. In fact, I had to admit I'd had the best sex of my life with my most recent 'boyfriend' of six weeks, James, who had subsequently 'left' me for a hot Hispanic girl. 'So if you enjoy it, why would you want to stop?' Because I'd started to realise I was utterly incapable of separating sex and emotion and was sick of pretending otherwise. I was sick of having sex before I knew someone properly, sick of physical intimacy preceding emotional. </p> <p>I'm not religious at all and have always believed that both men and women should have sexual experiences with several partners before they commit to one person for the rest of their lives. I even harbour a sneaking suspicion that monogamy is not possible, and that as long as no one finds out or gets hurt, maybe extramarital affairs can actually keep a long-term relationship alive. </p> <p>Shortly before my 'nearing-thirty' sex revelation, I bumped into an old friend, Diane. I remembered her from university as tall, blonde, glamorous, and with plenty of dates and admirers. We went for a drink and she told me she was celebrating her fifth wedding anniversary that week. Over the course of the evening I discovered the only person Diane had ever slept with was her husband. She'd met him, aged 25, two weeks before a devastating car-crash in which she nearly died. He visited her every day in hospital, and they fell in love over IV drips and plaster-casts. They had their first kiss six months after the crash in hospital, and were married a year after they met. </p> <p>I have to say my initial thought was: what a freak! What kind of person would commit to one guy for the rest of her life without having sampled a few others, just to check she was getting a good deal? Loser! Prepare the divorce papers! I'm a cynic, yeah, I'll admit. And then revelation number two hit. </p> <p>After Best-Sex-Of-My-Life guy - James - ditched me for the hot Hispanic, I'd been initially pretty upset, but as we lived in the same area, we bumped into each other on a regular basis and gradually became good friends. We would often end up drinking beer and chatting after work, and it occurred to me that this ease and friendship had been markedly lacking when we were sleeping together, possibly because we had sex before we even knew each other's last name.</p> <p>On one trip to the pub, James let slip that his new girlfriend, Luna, was a strict Catholic and refused to have sex before marriage. I was devastated! I'd put so much work into trying to impress him sexually, make myself alluring and attractive, and after he'd rejected me, I'd taken perverse comfort in convincing myself that Luna was some kind of sexual deviant I could not possibly compete with, when, in fact, she was the complete opposite. </p> <p>I started thinking more about sex and relationships, identifying unhealthy patterns in my past. I always fell for guys incredibly quickly, and sex came before full acquaintance in every one of my failed dating experiences, although the men I'd dated for a year or two had always started out as friends before we made the relationship physical. I talked about it with an older friend of mine, and his advice was simple. 'Don't put out. Then you know they like you for the right reasons.' As a good Democrat, I felt slightly weird seeking conservative advice from a man who voted for George Bush and thinks Sarah Palin is sex-on-a-stick, but I had to admit he had a point.</p> <p>In the past, I had relied too much on playing the vamp, on trying to 'hook' a boyfriend with my purported sexual prowess. I felt, almost unconsciously, that to be 'worth' something in the cattle-market of dating, I also had to hold a packed resume of sexual skills - acts so intimate that they are absurdly remote from any form of intimacy, particularly when performed like the quicktime with a relative stranger on date three.</p> <p>I felt like I was stuck in what Ariel Levy calls 'a spring-break variety of thongs-and-implants exhibitionism'. In her book Female Chauvinist Pigs, Levy questions whether the recent hyper-sexualised, commercialised porn star ideal of sex and exhibitionism many young women have adopted really amounts to empowerment. If I looked back at my last four sexual partners, all of whom I'd slept with while convincing myself I didn't want any emotional complication, I realised I'd been unable to separate sex and intimacy. I had, in effect, slept with most of them way before I felt comfortable with the fact, merely because I'd had the resigned attitude that 'I've done it so many times before, why not?'</p> <p>Sex wasn't significant and special for me any more, because if it was significant, if sex was as intimate and as special as I thought it was back when I was a virginal teen convinced no one would ever find me attractive enough to kiss, I'd be ripped to the core after over-exposure to 21st-century dating culture. Paris Hilton once said: 'My boyfriends always tell me I'm not sexual. Sexy, but not sexual.' There's a lot of sex out in the world right now, but bleached of intimacy through its very over-familiarity and lack of personalisation, like Paris, it's not very sexual.</p> <p>I'm now on month seven without sex, and in that time I haven't been on a single date. Of course, the fact I'm working 16 hours a day on the election campaign has helped curb my extra-curricular activities immensely - I feel that the only guy in my life right now is Senator Obama! But I've also found that making a solid resolve not to date has changed my attitude towards the men I meet in everyday life. No longer do I instantly assess them as potential dates or partners, I see them first as possible friends. I've developed a very close, impossibly chaste friendship with my neighbour, Dave, a 34-year-old musician.</p> <p>While I have to admit that I find him attractive, I also can't help acknowledging the fact that he probably isn't the guy I want to spend the rest of my life with. Why would I ruin a friendship by having sex with him then? Ironically, he too feels disillusioned with relationships and dating, and we often end up curled around each other on his bed, wrapped in a duvet, watching the election debates and falling asleep in a companionable hug that feels more intimate and genuine to me than any sex I've had in the past few years.</p> <p>James broke up with Luna after a few months, but he's stayed in my life, and when I'm on the road with the election campaign he's always at the end of a phone line, ready to dole out advice and listen to my stories of life campaigning in red states. He's become one of my closest friends, and even though I felt tempted to sleep with him again after he'd broken up with Luna, I resisted the urge and I'm glad I did. For some reason, sex made us strangers, and not sleeping together made us friends. I feel extremely lucky to have men like him and Dave in my life - they're my surrogate boyfriends. They support me, listen to my problems, I listen to theirs, we hang out together and enjoy each other's company - we just don't kiss, or anything else. </p> <p>I still think sex is an integral part of a healthy relationship, but holding back from sex until you've forged a strong, solid friendship ensures that sex doesn't dominate a relationship, that it becomes another component holding equal weight with trust, friendship, honesty, mutual support.</p> <p>I was registering new voters in a bar with a colleague of mine, Lakshmi, the other day, and she tentatively brought up the sex issue. She'd heard I'd decided to give it up for 12 months, and wanted to know how that was going. I found out she'd recently had an abortion under pressure from her ex-boyfriend, was understandably disillusioned with men and wanted to take a complete break. Like me, she was someone who fell headlong into passionate, lust-filled sexual relationships that fizzled out quickly leaving only a few singe marks. </p> <p>I would never say I regret my past and the number of people I've slept with, but I'm certainly glad I've made a conscious decision to change my lifestyle. I think of it as a natural progression, a part of growing and changing. Dating and mating wasn't working, and while it was fun for a while, I wanted something more. There seems to be a pervading, unarticulated suspicion that it's somehow weak and un-feminist to admit to yourself that you can't have sex without emotion, that you don't want to be promiscuous, that you would like a serious relationship that will lead somewhere other than the bedroom. I have to say, here and now, I can't sleep with someone without developing feelings for them, I don't want to be promiscuous, and I would like a serious relationship with someone.</p> <p>These days I feel like I've rediscovered an intimacy that was somehow absent in my sexual life - I guess we live in an age that almost celebrates the death of intimacy. For me, it was only by stopping and taking time out, concentrating on my work and friendships, that I could actually step back and see that my sexual liberation was perversely trapping me in destructive relationships, while intimacy had become something elusive, insubstantial, disappointing, surreal - a utopia of sorts.</p> <p>As the possible next president of the United States says, 'Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.' I had to take the initiative and change my behaviour and attitude. I think Senator Obama would be pretty amused.</p> <p>\u2022 Anonymous is a 29-year-old Briton living in America</p>",
  "<h2>Indonesia 1969: Rully Dasaad</h2> <p><strong>After Barack's parents split up, he moved with his mother and Indonesian stepfather to Jakarta, aged seven, where he befriended classmate Dasaad - now a commercial photographer - at Basuki Primary School. </strong></p> <p>When the teacher introduced 'Barry Soetoro' [Obama went by his stepfather's name at the time] to the class, he was very exotic. He was the only non-Indonesian; he was taller than all of us and chubby. He was accompanied by his white mum and his Indonesian stepfather, who was wearing a military outfit, and I remember thinking, that's strange, he looks half black, half white - maybe this is what a boy from Hawaii looks like. He wore Bermuda pants that extended below the knee, whereas our short pants were halfway down our thigh, and he wore T-shirts with stripes whereas ours were plain. He was the only left-handed student in class - it's not considered polite in Indonesia to be left-handed - so it was always amazing to see him writing with his left hand. </p> <p>Barry was the only one in the class who had bread in his lunch box - the rest of us had traditional Indonesian snacks. There's one called kepan - sticky rice and desiccated coconut which you have to dip in this very strong chilli sauce. It's hot even for us. But Barry was very curious. He tried it and burnt his mouth, and he was saying: 'It's hot, it's hot.' You can see he was always open to learning something new.</p> <p>He and his mum had been living in Indonesia since 1967. She worked for USAID, helping Indonesian women in the countryside to live in a more Western fashion. For the first two months, Barry was still adjusting. We had a singing class once a week and he wouldn't sing, probably because he was shy and worried that he might sing a word wrong. But after three months, he spoke Indonesian. He became one of us. </p> <p>I remember one time he had a birthday and I went to his house with some classmates. Barry's house was down a mud track; to play football there, you had to put plastic bags on your feet. Near his house was a small canal - at that time it wasn't polluted - and they had small salamanders in it. Barry had chickens in his home field. It was totally normal for Jakarta in those days.</p> <p>Me, Barry and Yanto used to play together every lunch break for two years and he was very loyal to our gang. If I said: 'Don't play with that boy, play with us', he'd do it. We'd try to finish our lunch as fast as we could and then we'd go to the fields and play: running, hide and seek, marbles and tak gebok, an Indonesian game of tag where you try to hit your fellow boys with a ball. One time, there was a naughty young boy who missed Barry with the ball so he took a small stone from the playing field and threw it and hit Barry's head, which started bleeding. I remember Barry just went quiet - his mum had taught him not to fight. He was one of those kids you could tell was brought up with a lot of love and affection and so he was never angry or nasty.</p> <p>We loved playing so much we were always in on the third bell. Most of the girls had a problem with our gang because we were always very active and sweating, and sometimes we'd miss-throw and hit a girl. 'Oh, here they are again,' they'd say. 'Oh, you're sweating from the sun, you stink, go away.' So I had to teach Barry Indonesian swear words to say back to the girls.</p> <p>At the time, my father and President Sukarno were the only people in the country with Cadillacs, and both were presents from my grandpa, who was the richest man in Indonesia. Grandpa bought me all the DC Comic books, and I was the only one who had them, so Barry and Yanto would borrow the books and copy pictures of Batman and Spider-Man out and ask me to judge which was better. Barry was always better than Yanto. Even Yanto always agreed with that. Barry had a great eye. </p> <p>We came back from the summer vacation for fifth grade and Barry wasn't there. The teacher said he'd gone back to Hawaii. Our small gang was split up. </p> <p>Somebody said in 2006: 'Look at Time magazine - your old friend is running for President.' I didn't recognise him. He was much slimmer. Then I saw a picture where he was laughing and I recognised him from the smile and the teeth.</p> <p>Later on there were allegations that the school was a madrassa, and foreign journalists began hanging around. But the small mosque at the school today was added on in 2001. There was no mosque at the time and it wasn't even a particularly religious school.</p> <p>It's very sad if a great nation like America wants to persecute Obama just because he was born from a Muslim dad and had a Muslim stepfather. I'm sure one of the reasons for the flexibility he has today is his experiences in Indonesia. At the school, there were half-Chinese and half-Dutch Indonesians, Javanese people, Ambonese, and there were Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Catholics. Barry is used to a mix.</p> <h2>Hawaii 1975: Tony Peterson</h2> <p><strong>Barack moved back to Honolulu, Hawaii in 1971, aged 10, and lived with his grandparents. At Punahou High School, he met Peterson, who now works for the United Methodist Church in Tennessee.</strong></p> <p>There were only five black kids out of 1,600. I used to get to school early; I'd see Barry and he'd say: 'Let's go shoot some hoops' and we'd play pick-up basketball together. He was a bit chubby but far better than me. Rik, Barry and myself jockeyed around and talked casually, and realised that here we are, intelligent black men, and we could have some good conversations.</p> <p>We'd sit on the sidestep of the library, where a radio would be playing Marvin Gaye and the Eagles, and have these great conversations about life. I recorded one for an English assignment. Rik asked what we thought 'time' was, and Barry replied: 'Time is just a collection of human experiences combined so that they make a long, flowing stream of thought.'</p> <p>He was 14 then, Rik was 16, I was 17, and Barry was definitely matching us. We talked about the future. Rik said he'd be a doctor, which he is; I was going to be a lawyer, which I'm not; and Barry was going to be a basketball player. Barry wrote in my year book: 'Go on and get that law degree, and I'm going to be a famous basketball player, and when I need to sue my team I'll call you.' Of course he went on to be the lawyer and not a shabby one either.</p> <p>We talked about race but not, I thought, out of a deep sense of pain. The revolutionary anger started to die down in the Seventies. We weren't dealing with the harsh barriers, more with the rate of change, the progress we were making. Black culture was popular across the race spectrum. Jesse Jackson was a big public figure, everyone loved Stevie Wonder, the most popular sports star was Julius 'Doctor J' Ervin, the basketball genius. So we were talking about things like: would the girls date us black guys and would we see a black President in our lifetime? The answer to the first was yes and on the second our take was: there'll be progress, but we won't see it happen.</p> <p>Decades later, I was in a bookstore in Boulder, Colorado, visiting my brother Keith and he picks this book Dreams From My Father out of the remainder bin and said: 'Look who wrote this.' It was Barry's memoir. Where he talks about his Punahou years, I was surprised by the agony he was feeling. But I'd been black all my life in a way that Barry sort of hadn't. People looked at him and saw a black man, but his own identity was that he was raised by and living with his white mother and these white grandparents. And maybe because of his white half, white people were willing to let their racist side out in front of him. So he had a lot to wrestle with, especially as a teenager. He was questioning things and following them towards agony and resolution.</p> <p>In 2004 (at the Democratic convention), I told all my friends that an old friend of mine was making the speech. I've voted both sides before, but I have never heard a political speech so profound. What he was saying is what I believe - that's the America I want to live in. I'm extremely proud of him and I trust him. I know the man. I trust his intellect. I trust his judgment.</p> <p>One of my favourite lines from that speech was something we used to talk about on the library step: 'We need to eradicate the slander that says a black kid with a book is acting white.' That was the kind of stuff we'd experienced; I had lived a lifetime of trying to do well academically and having black kids say: 'You're acting white.'</p> <p>Punahou was a good school - my family had to save every penny to send me there, Obama scraped in on a scholarship. It was originally a school to educate missionaries' children and it still had that missionary spirit. One of the things that Punahou instilled in us is that you're given much in order to give much - you're here to go out and help the world.</p> <h2>Los Angeles 1980: Margot Mifflin</h2> <p><strong>University friend of Obama at Occidental College, LA. Now a journalism professor.</strong></p> <p>I was a year ahead of him. I invited him and his roommate Hasan Chandoo, who I started dating, to dinner, and they showed up looking crisp and fresh-faced. I'd go to student parties round their house; I remember dancing to 'Once in a Lifetime' by Talking Heads in a sea of people. </p> <p>Barry was a focused, dedicated student and an earnest, sincere person, but he wasn't too serious to talk about the fun stuff. We'd hang out and talk about what was happening in class and who was dating whom. He goofed around with the rest of us. He was engaging and perhaps even charismatic, but I wasn't aware of him being a playboy. He was friends with women who were impressive feminists as well as people who were more socially focused. He straddled groups: the arts/literary crowd, which tended to stick together, and the political activist crowd, likewise. He belonged to both.</p> <p>I studied in a creative writing class with him. I remember him submitting a poem called 'Pop' (since published in the New Yorker). It was a penetrating portrait of his grandfather, in which his grandfather asked him what he was going to do with his life. </p> <p>I was also at the rally where he gave his first speech, an anti-apartheid rally at Occidental. He was hunched over the mike, it was too low for him. He was nervous and he was rushing a little. I recall him saying something like: 'Occidental should spend less time investing in South Africa and more time on multicultural education.' That was impressive because you think of multiculturalism as a Nineties phenomenon, and here he was in the early Eighties, thinking about the need for that in an educational sense.</p> <p>It didn't occur to anyone this guy could become President. He certainly didn't go around saying anything that audacious or ambitious. He was a nose-to-the-grindstone, quiet worker, not the kind who would run around tooting his own horn, even though he was probably getting messages from his professors that he had serious talent. I think he was figuring out who he would be and when he left Occidental he took the steps to become that person. It's like Shakespeare's line: 'Some are born great, some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them.' He was the guy who achieved greatness and it clearly took a lot of hard work to do that.</p> <h2>Chicago 1980s: Auma Obama</h2> <p><strong>Obama's Kenyan half-sister, who first met Barack in the Eighties. Worked in children's services in Reading, UK but has since moved to Nairobi.</strong></p> <p>We used to see photos of Barack as he was growing up in America. My father always talked about him, that Barack would come home to Kenya some day. </p> <p>He would say to us: 'You've got to write to your brother Barry' and obviously as a child you think: 'Oh yeah, OK, all right', but you're not really that fussed, so I didn't make any contact. </p> <p>It was actually Barack who contacted me first, after the death of our father. I was in Germany, studying in Heidelberg, and he wrote to me. He has the same name and handwriting as our father so when I looked at the back of the letter I had this shiver go up my spine. We corresponded for a while and then I went over to the US to see a friend. It was the mid-Eighties. I had decided to visit Barack as his guest in Chicago. </p> <p>I was nervous. I was very close to my dad and Barack was a piece of him that I hadn't known. What if we did not get along? Well, I wasn't disappointed. We just got into the car, his little car, and started talking and never stopped. It was a very intense 10 days together.</p> <p>Barack was a community organiser. He was just a small person, a nobody, but he had the same intensity he has today. He was disturbed by the status quo and was working at the grassroots to see what was going wrong. I was very active in political awareness work in Germany and I saw that he had the same energy and passion to make a difference and to change people's lives. </p> <p>For me it was: 'Wow, this is like Christmas', where you get this huge, big present of somebody who actually understands what you are saying, where you're coming from. </p> <p>Later, I moved back home for a year to work as a tutorial fellow at the University in Nairobi. Barack visited Kenya for the first time. I picked him up in my Beetle. He did not have any of these hang-ups, you know: 'Oh there are mosquitoes.' He came and just was. It made it so easy. We spent a lot of time discussing and explaining things. </p> <p>I don't know if it was strange for Barack to come here. The thing is it wasn't strange for the family. Nobody but me had met Barry but everybody knew him from our father. We don't dramatise family in Kenya and people weren't fazed by him at all, although they did find some things interesting. For my grandmother, it was his accent and the fact that he could not speak Luo. </p> <p>And all the kids would come and compare their skin colour to Barack's. People had many questions for him and Barack definitely had many questions for them. There was never a moment of silence or embarrassed awkwardness. </p> <p>It wasn't all nice. Sometimes, he wanted to see relatives I didn't really get along with and he'd be like: 'It's my right and I need to see them and I'm not going alone and you're coming with me'. </p> <p>To take a break, we went to the coast. Coming back (from Mombasa to Nairobi) we travelled by bus. The driver was going so fast and I was so, so scared. Barack took it all in his stride. I, the Kenyan who should have been used to it, was furious at the driver. But Barack was just like: 'OK, this is the adventure that it is.' He came with this big baggage of tolerance and relaxedness and the ability to just absorb. </p> <p>When I went to his wedding [in the US, in 1992] I could see that people were very impressed with him. People listened to him. I could see that a lot of them were people of prominence and thinkers in the community. </p> <p>Today, I still see the same Barack I first met. At home, he's the same, very normal person. </p> <p>Politically, he's now a big shot, but there's an expression that says a big shot is a small shot who never stopped shooting. He was shooting back then - not in the sense the Republicans would use it, with a rifle - but in that he was always working, and people came on board and slowly more and more people understood that what this guy is trying to do is going to make a difference to America and the American people.</p> <p>Sometimes, I'm awed by what he has achieved. I'm very, very proud of him. I have to keep reminding myself: 'Oh he's just my little brother' just to bring it back to reality and make sure that I don't get too excited about who I am because of what he's done.</p> <h2>Chicago 1985: Gerald Kellman</h2> <p><strong>Employed Obama as a community organiser at the Calumet Community Religious Conference, Chicago, 1985-88. </strong></p> <p>I met Barack at a coffee shop on Lexington Avenue, New York. He was a year out of Columbia and he'd just quit a job working as a journalist for a business publication.</p> <p>One of his preoccupations was being a novelist and he had taken the journalism job to facilitate that. He wrote a number of short stories about his experiences, other people's lives and their struggles. I read a couple and I thought they were pretty good. He's a wonderful writer by non-professional standards, but he knew he wasn't up with his heroes. </p> <p>So he'd applied to work for my group as a community organiser in the impoverished South Side of Chicago. The Calumet region of Chicago was the largest producer of steel in the country. When the mills shut down, the jobs went, gangs and drugs became huge and the place unravelled.</p> <p>Barack had grown up as an outsider, without a father, as an American kid living abroad and separated from his mother at high school. Outsiders do one of two things: try to be like everyone else or identify with other outsiders. Barack did the latter. He was reflective and willing to identify with people in poverty, with people who faced discrimination.</p> <p>He was also idealistic. He had been inspired by Dr Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement, but he was a decade or so too late for it and this was the closest he could get.</p> <p>I was offering him $10,000 a year and two grand for a car and I remember thinking: someone who was smart enough to do it should have been smart enough not to do it. The salary was ridiculous, the status low, the prospects bad and he had to move to Chicago. The way I convinced him was to talk about the Calumetians' lives and he wanted to see what he could do to help them. Barack is often motivated by a desire to learn, and he was hungry for hands-on experience.</p> <p>Chicago's South Side contains the largest black community in the States. Barack's job was to go into the community and interview individuals to find out what the problems were and then teach them the public skills to get change and that if they were to get anywhere the community needed to work together. Barack had to give people confidence and he did it brilliantly because he listened. He's a remarkably quick learner and not at all snobbish about whether he learns from people of high or low status.</p> <p>In community organising, people often don't like each other. The less there is, the more people tend to grasp for it. One day, Barack noticed that the city had removed asbestos from the manager's office of the Altgeld housing estate, but not from the residents' flats. People were so incensed by the inequity that they were more than ready to organise. They drove down to Springfield to confront the politicians and it got that area of Chicago mobilised in a way they never had been before.</p> <p>I think a lot of his orientation was formed in his time as an organiser. Local politicians and clergy felt our group was a potential threat and Barack had to decide when to compromise and when not to, when to be confrontational and when to be collaborative and those parts of his character were shaped during his organising career.</p> <p>He was resilient and good at turning things around. Always, when things were going badly, Barack would stay up most of the night, trying to figure things out. And by the next day he'd be meeting people and we'd be trying an alternative strategy.</p> <p>We socialised together. He would come over for dinner at our house and we played tennis together. He was neat for a young man. His afro had been cropped by that time and he would wear button-down, short-sleeve shirts, slacks and shoes. He couldn't afford to take his shirt to the laundry but it always looked neatly pressed. His apartment was also very neat, almost monastic, without much furniture and filled with books. He was very thin, skinnier than he is now. Women would regularly invite him home to dinner to try to fatten him up, but it didn't work.</p> <p>Three years after he'd started work for us, we were walking around at a conference at the Harvard divinity school in Cambridge and he said he'd decided to leave organising for law school. He didn't see organising making the big differences that he felt were needed. He hadn't met Michelle yet, but he wanted a family and he didn't want the uncertainty of the low salary. I thought his reasons were good and that he'd done a great job.</p> <p>He was open to learning about the church. As for his personal orientation towards God, he was working that out too. He was influenced by the kind of people he was meeting and the role that faith played in their lives. He was moving from an intellectual understanding to a more visceral and experiential understanding.</p> <h2>Jakarta 1980s: Julia Surakusuma</h2> <p><strong>Close friend of Obama's mother, Jakarta, Indonesia, 1981 to 1995 . Sociologist and feminist writer. </strong></p> <p>Ann was very proud of Barry. She was very close to her children and spoke very warmly about them. There aren't many mothers who could create their children in the way she created him.</p> <p>I always resent the suggestion that she was not a good mother because Barry went back to Hawaii to live with his grandparents when he was 10. It was precisely because she was a good mother that she made that choice, to do what was best for him. It was a very painful decision for her but they contacted each other as frequently as possible.</p> <p>Both Barry and his sister, Maya, are the living incarnation of what is best about their mother. Often, it's really painful for me to watch him on television because I can see his mother in him. </p> <p>Ann was very smart and, in many ways, a pioneer. She was really brave, even revolutionary, to have married entirely outside her culture. She was a rebel in a way, but not confrontational. They are the same qualities you see in Barry. The fact that he wants to work for the community, that was his mum. The people's person side of him, that was his mum.</p> <p>Ann and Barry have 'fire', but in the case of Ann, it was tempered by her earthy, motherly nature, whereas with Barry, he's more 'air' and expresses his passion more through his intellect. I met him two or three times when he came to visit his mum in Jakarta when he was in his early twenties. I remember him coming into the living room and sitting on the arm of the sofa. I remember so well his smile and his personality. He was charismatic even then.</p> <h2>Harvard 1989: Larry Tribe</h2> <p><strong>University professor of constitutional law, who taught Obama, and for whom Obama worked as a research assistant.</strong></p> <p>Barack came to see me during his first year at Harvard. It was 31 March 1989. I found my desk calendar and I'd written his name with an exclamation point. From the late 1960s, when I began teaching as a professor at Harvard Law School, until the present, there has been no other student whose name I've noted in that way.</p> <p>He impressed me from the beginning as an extraordinary young man. He was obviously brilliant, driven and interested in pursuing ideas with a clear sense that his reasons for being in law school were not to climb some corporate ladder, nor simply to broaden his opportunities, but to go back to the community. </p> <p>He had a combination of intellectual acumen, open-mindedness, resistance to stereotypical thinking and conventional presuppositions. He also had a willingness to change his mind when new evidence appeared, confidence in his own moral compass and a maturity that obviously came from some combination of his upbringing and earlier experience.</p> <p>I asked him to be my research assistant, a role he filled for a year and a half. We had a much more vibrant dialogue than one typically has with a research assistant. He was witty, he had a lighthearted touch and even though we were dealing with some pretty grave and weighty subjects, it was always a breezy thing to talk to him. </p> <p>He had a charismatic quality and was very engaging. Other students gravitated towards him and liked him rather than envying him or wanting to compete with him. </p> <p>Typically in a place as competitive as Harvard or Yale, one student will make a comment and another student will try and one-up him by saying something cleverer or wittier. But Barack would never put anyone else down. If a student expressed a view he didn't agree with, he nevertheless saw the value in it and built on it. </p> <p>He found points of communality and gave people the sense that he could see where they were coming from, and what their core beliefs were, and why they were worthy of respect. It was really a precursor to the way he engages in dialogue across ideological and partisan divisions. </p> <p>In his second year, he became the first African American president of the Harvard Law Review [one of the leading law journals in the world]. It was a position which represented the judgment of his peers about his intellectual acumen and his leadership capacities. He emerged with the enthusiastic backing of other students. In no sense was this some kind of affirmative action; he was chosen as the best person people could find.</p> <p>We used to take long walks on the Charles River in Boston. Our conversations were enormously wide-ranging and enjoyable, about life in general, not just about work. I had no doubt as I got to know him that he had an unlimited future. I didn't have a clear sense of what direction it would take, but I thought it would be political and I thought the sky was the limit.</p> <p>He had a personal quality which was transcendent and I continued to feel that way about him each time we met. And the quality he demonstrated that I've always been left with more than any other is authenticity. There isn't a fibre of phoniness about this guy.</p> <h2>Illinois 1996: Senator Terry Link</h2> <p><strong>A friend of Obama since they played poker and golf together at the Capitol, Springfield, Illinois in the 1990s. </strong></p> <p>We came into the Illinois Senate together in 1996, were seat mates - we sat next to one another on the Senate floor - and office mates - our offices were adjacent. The Senate schedule had us in Springfield away from our families on Wednesday nights. </p> <p>I don't drink at all, Barack would have a beer once in a while, so we didn't carouse the bars like lots of the others. You could say that we were both measured personalities. So I said: 'Why don't we have a card game?' We called it the 'Committee Meeting' but there was no shop talk allowed. We had seven or eight Republicans and Democrats and it was a time to get to know one another out of the shadows of the Capitol. We'd take the suits and ties off, sit back and have a night of relaxing. It was low-stakes poker: a dollar stake, three dollar top raise. No one was going to lose their mortgage or house. Barack wore sweat pants and a baseball cap, drank a beer and would cadge a few cigarettes.</p> <p>If his style of poker is like how he'll run the White House I'll sleep well at night. He is very conscious of the odds. If he thought he had a chance of winning he'd stay in the game; if he thought not he'd fold straight away. He read and played the field very well. He was serious at it.</p> <p>There was another player, Larry Walsh, a relatively conservative Democrat. Barack trumped his four of a kind with a higher four of a kind to take the pot and Walsh threw his cards down. 'Doggone it, Barack,' he said. 'If you were more liberal in your card playing and more conservative in your politics, we'd get along much better.'</p> <p>Barack's golf game was terrible at first, that's probably the nicest way to say it. I'm an avid golfer. He hated losing to me. He's so competitive and his frustration got so bad that he went out and took lessons. His game improved a lot but I still beat him.</p> <p>As Republicans controlled the House it was a monumental task to get legislation passed. Barack could forge relations with others very well. He was very even-keeled, even when bullied on the Senate floor. It frustrated him, but he always kept his cool. His demeanour was: 'I'm going to explain this, I'm not going to get into a fist fight about this.'</p> <p>One of his biggest preoccupations was healthcare and he worked very hard with the Republicans to say: 'This is something advantageous to your party as well.' When we took a majority in 2002, he became chairman of public health, but he kept his relationships with the Republicans; the last thing he was going to do was say: 'I'm in charge and I forget you guys.' The old chairman of public health used to have meetings in City Hall, but Barack would take the meetings out and about to the people.</p> <p>I saw his daughters being born and I know his wife Michelle very well. She is a very level-headed individual and she keeps Barack's feet on the ground.</p> <h2>London 2008: David Lammy</h2> <p><strong>British MP and Minister of State for Higher Education; friend of Obama's since 2005. </strong></p> <p>I first met him at Harvard at an event for black alumni from all over the world. There was lots for us to talk about because we share similar heritage; my family are from Guyana, half his family are from Kenya, we're both black, we're both politicians in western democracies; but beyond law and politics there was lots of synergy. </p> <p>What I found interesting about Obama is his reach beyond America. He has an acute understanding of developing countries.</p> <p>He is someone who I find it very easy to get along with. He's incredibly charming and funny. He's clearly got an obsession with ties because whenever he meets me he talks about the ties that British people wear. I'll be wearing something with loud colours, and in America they are a bit more straightforward, and he makes light of that. He'll go: 'Look at my tie compared to yours!' - this coming from one of the coolest men in the world! </p> <p>There have been moments where he's rung me up over the past few years, and he's been sincere and very calm. He's not someone that gets into a flap or displays any anxiousness, even though sometimes those conversations have been in the heat of anxious situations.</p> <p>I met him this February when he had just come out of Super Tuesday. We were in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, very much rural America, and he gave a speech in the university. He went down really well but what struck me was that, despite his hectic schedule, backstage he wanted to thank every local official: he spent a good 20 minutes with all of them. He then started to walk me around, introducing me to them, and I was a bit 'I'm not really terribly important', but he was determined that they should meet the Minister for Skills in the UK. </p> <p>When I saw him I felt he'd been emboldened and strengthened by his experiences. He always had charisma and a relaxed, personable style, but a few years later one can see his growth as a presidential candidate and a man. </p> <p>We've got a professional friendship; we haven't been golfing together. I don't think he's got enough time for that, and actually neither have I. But his faith is very important to him, and that's something I have had some affinity with and that we reflect on. He has also lost both his parents, and he was very gracious when my mother died of ovarian cancer earlier this year; he had lost his mother to the same illness. </p> <p>Like all inquisitive, curious and interesting politicians, he is someone who can scan the horizons of many different issues and can find politics in cultural situations - the sadness of death, the experience of living in a developing country and what that means, or economic hardship in rural middle America. He is someone who has a strong emotional intelligence as well as a strong cognitive intelligence.</p> <h2>The rise of Barack Obama</h2> <p><strong>Early life and education</strong></p> <p><strong>1961</strong> Born 4 August in Honolulu, Hawaii to Barack Obama Sr, a Kenyan and Ann Dunham, a white American anthropologist.

  "<p>Friday is gay wedding day at San Francisco City Hall, one of those examples of American monumental architecture for which the word 'grandiose' might have been invented. One by one, the couples make their way past the security guards and metal detectors, through the vast rotunda and up the marble staircase to a smaller, domed area where most of the ceremonies take place.</p> <p>Like all couples on their big day, they are beaming, locking eyes as they pledge to share a lifetime together. But they are also in a hurry. 'We'd been thinking about this step very seriously for a long time,' says one tall, dark-haired woman - a college professor who moved with her partner to San Francisco from Kentucky. 'But we wanted to make sure we could get married before election day.'</p> <p>In California, election day - a week on Tuesday - will not just decide whether Barack Obama or John McCain wins the White House. In an echo of the culture wars that have dominated US politics for the past four decades, a separate ballot initiative - opposed by Obama with the caveat that he personally favours only gay 'civil unions', but endorsed by McCain - could shut the door on same-sex weddings in the city that first sanctioned them four years ago. </p> <p>Supporters of the ballot, known as 'Proposition Eight', call it the 'Marriage Protection Act'. If passed, it would undo the latest twist in a long-running battle over gay marriages - the California Supreme Court's recent ruling that barring such ceremonies violates the state constitution's equal rights provisions - by amending the basic law to define marriage in California as valid 'only between a man and a woman'.</p> <p>In an extraordinary example of life imitating art, the nail-biting conclusion to the campaign over 'Prop 8' coincides with the launch of one of the most eagerly awaited movies of the year. It is a biopic starring Oscar-winning actor Sean Penn as the San Francisco city supervisor who, most probably more than anyone else, was responsible for the seismic political changes that allowed gay couples to marry.</p> <p>His name was Harvey Milk. Three decades ago, his capture of a seat on the Board of Supervisors made him the first openly gay person to win elected city office in America. He served for just 11 months and the political high point of his time in office was to lead the battle to defeat another ballot proposition - Proposition Six of 1978 - that would have led to the sacking of all openly gay teachers in California's state schools.</p> <p>While few of the dozens of couples celebrating their City Hall weddings seem to notice, they are reciting their vows a dozen paces from a recently installed bronze bust of Milk - and only a few steps farther from the spot where, on 27 November, 1978, he and the city's then mayor, George Moscone, were gunned down and killed by an embittered conservative council rival.</p> <p>'Harvey Bernard Milk, 1930-1978', the inscription reads. Harvey is smiling - partly, his friends like to think, from the infectious joy he took in shaking up a political establishment where old money, old interests and old prejudices were resisting the tide of change; partly at seeing how far the changes he championed have since taken root; and partly, too, in wonder at the imminent prospect of becoming not just a San Francisco gay icon but a fully fledged member of America's national political pantheon.</p> <p>Next Tuesday evening, the red carpet will be rolled out in front of the Castro Theatre, the movie house at the heart of San Francisco's main gay neighbourhood. Penn, who lives across the San Francisco Bay, will be there. So will James Franco, of Spider-Man fame, who plays his gay lover Scott Smith, and a host of other prominent names on both sides of the camera who helped make the film - the latest in a number of previous efforts that have run aground since the moving 1984 documentary The Times of Harvey Milk won an Oscar in 1985. </p> <p>The political life and violent death of Harvey Milk represented a golden age for this formerly working-class Irish neighbourhood, changed for ever by an influx of gay people from around the country in the late 1960s and 1970s. Known simply as The Castro, the area occupies a few colourful blocks that stretch from the major thoroughfare of Market Street towards the pricey residential area of Noe Valley. </p> <p>The Penn movie, entitled Milk, has for local residents and the city's liberal communities become both a validation of all that Harvey Milk set in train and a reminder of how fragile some of those gains may still prove to be. </p> <p>When filming began early this year, a crowd gathered to watch the crews recreate the shop fronts and street architecture of three decades ago. 'It was like a bizarre dream,' laughs Martha Asten, who with her husband, Ernie, runs a family hardware store established in the 1930s and became close friends with Milk. The crowds swelled further when Penn and Franco staged a long kiss on a Castro sidewalk. 'After our kiss, Sean texted Madonna - his ex-wife - and said, \"I just broke my cherry kissing a guy. I thought of you. I don't know why\",' Franco quipped in an interview with the gay magazine Out. 'And then she wrote back and said, \"Congratulations\".'</p> <p>Those who knew Milk see the real value of the film in recapturing his political vision, fierce commitment to civil rights and raw political skills. It is a message they hope will resonate both with new generations of gay people and a much wider audience.</p> <p>'Harvey Milk,' says Matthew Bajko, the assistant editor on the city's main gay paper, the Bay Area Reporter, 'was like Barack Obama 30 years before him - lighting a fire for people who really didn't believe in politics.' </p> <p>Milk grew up in a middle-class Jewish community on Long Island. He served in the Navy and was a stock analyst on Wall Street before a connection through one of his boyfriends brought him to the fringe of a series of productions, including Hair and Jesus Christ Superstar. Then, at the start of 1970s, a long-haired Milk moved west with Scott Smith.</p> <p>They opened a camera store on Castro Street - now an upmarket gift and home accessories shop. But from the start, as the journalist Randy Shilts says in his definitive biography, it was clear that Milk's love for 'theatre' had finally been married with a cause: politics. His central message was of gay identity and pride. The alternative for homosexuals, he said, was often fear, guilt, closeted agony, even suicide. To the few influential gay voices on the city's political scene, he insisted that waiting for mainstream liberal allies to advance gay rights was short-sighted, cowardly and wrong.</p> <p>Still, from the outset - long before he had cut his hair, built a strong local base and won election at his fourth attempt in 1977 - Milk demonstrated a broader message and a genius, at both grassroots level and through a mainstream media that had all but ignored 'gay stories', of getting his message heard. 'The very first time I saw him,' Asten recalls, 'Harvey was campaigning up on 18th Street and Castro - this guy with long hair, a hippie. He was up on a park bench or something and talking, and I'm walking past and I stop to listen. And I said, this is the first politician that really spoke to me.' </p> <p>They joined Milk in his attempts to get businesses to help create a common Castro identity, embracing both the new tide of gay immigrants and established residents. Milk also made a breakthrough with traditionally anti-gay union leaders when he helped reinvigorate a campaign to boycott Coors beer by getting all the neighbourhood gay bars on board.</p> <p>But it was not just this 'coalition building' that marked out Milk, according to Tom Ammiano, a former teacher in The Castro who first worked with him during the campaign against Prop Six. Now one of two gay members of the Board of Supervisors, he says: 'Harvey saw beyond the gay issue. He saw that gays, and others, cared about housing, rent control, police reform.' </p> <p>As supervisor, Milk successfully led support for a gay rights ordinance. He also launched campaigns for better transport and support of other minority groups and senior citizens. Still, the apogee of his period in office was his role in the campaign to defeat the ballot proposition against gay teachers. For weeks, despite opinion polls predicting a landslide defeat as the national mood swung against gay rights, he debated with supporters across California.</p> <p>Outgunned financially, he delivered an Obama-like appeal for gays and civil rights allies to send in 'just one dollar' each to fund the fightback. He joined Ammiano and others in knocking on doors and stopping voters on the street in an attempt to warn them about the underlying civil rights implications. And on the night they defeated Proposition Six, resoundingly.</p> <p>With Proposition Eight looming, Milk's friends hope Penn's movie will bring back the vivid memories of him they all seem to share. The first is of the public celebration after his two most important and improbable triumphs - winning city office in 1977 and leading the fight against Prop Six the following year. The second was of the city's shock and grief after he was killed, which brought together tens of thousands of people - gay and straight - on a candle-lit march through the city.</p> <p>But the final memory, they agree, is the most important. Asten calls it Milk's ability to reach out to those in need. 'He was not just about gays,' she says, adding: 'He would have been there campaigning against this ridiculous Prop Eight.' Milk 'was about helping the underdog... If they had a right, something they were being trampled on, that's where he was.'</p> <p>Ammiano says that Milk conveyed the significance of the Proposition Eight battle in what became known as his 'hope speech' - inspired by a phone call from a young gay man in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after his election victory. 'He said thanks,' Milk told his audience, adding that his election might provide 'hope for a better tomorrow'. Without hope, he said, 'not only gays, but the blacks, the Asians, the disabled, the seniors, give up... And you and you and you, you've gotta give 'em hope!'</p> <p>That, Ammiano says, was one lesson Milk can deliver afresh through Sean Penn - accompanied by another important lesson learnt during his election defeats. 'If, God forbid, Prop Eight passes, there's another chapter. We will return to it. We - along with a growing number of straight allies - are not going to go away.'</p> <h2>Life of a trailblazer</h2> <p>Harvey Milk was born on 22 May, 1930, in Woodmere, Long Island.</p> <p>He attended New York State Teachers College in Albany, and spent four years in the US Navy after graduating in 1951. After a brief period as a high school teacher, he went on to work as a stock analyst on Wall Street before moving to San Francisco, California.</p> <p>He ran for office three times before being voted on to the city's Board of Supervisors in 1977, the first openly gay person to win city office in America. </p> <p>In mid-1978, he led a successful campaign to defeat a ballot proposition - Proposition Six - which would have barred gays from teaching in California's state schools. </p> <p>On 27 November, 1978, a right-wing former colleague on the Board of Supervisors, Dan White, entered city hall and shot dead Milk and the mayor, George Moscone.</p>",
  "<p>Voting for a Republican president runs in the blood of places like Gainesville. The pretty little town of 15,000 sits in north Texas ranch country and it is safe to say that Barack Obama has few fans here. Certainly Jim Farquhar, who works in the justice system, has taken to heart warnings that Obama has links with dangerous radicals, such as former 1960s militant Bill Ayers. </p> <p>'Obama scares me. He has all these friendships. You just don't know how that might effect him once he gets into office,' Farquhar said as he stood outside Gainsville's sturdy old courthouse. 'I'm voting for John McCain.'</p> <p>Such worries are increasingly not shared by many other Americans. Weeks of relentless attacks on Obama by McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin have not succeeded in denting Obama's lead. Instead it has strengthened. Across America, battleground states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania are falling into Obama's column and southern states such as Virginia and North Carolina are going from red to blue. Some Democratic insiders are even whispering about the prospect of a landslide.</p> <p>The flipside of that is a potentially devastating Republican loss. If current polling holds true, the party may be reduced to its core support in the solid red heartland that runs through Texas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Georgia and other southern and western states. That would trigger a profound crisis for a party that just three years ago was basking in the afterglow of a convincing presidential win and dreaming of creating a 'permanent majority'. </p> <p>Now that same Republican party could face a prolonged period in the political wilderness, working out how to appeal to an American public that seems prepared to send a pro-choice, black senator from Chicago to the White House and reject a conservative Republican war hero. </p> <p>'The Republican party is going to have to work out what sort of party it actually wants to be. It's a changing world for them,' said Professor Shaun Bowler, a political scientist at the University of California at Riverside. It might not be easy. A powerful Democratic win could wipe out Republican moderates. It could leave the party in the grip of its conservative and evangelical base who remain critical of figures such as McCain but who are wildly enthusiastic about politicians such as Palin. The Republican party could end up in a bitter civil war for its political future.'</p> <p>One of the key battlegrounds in that conflict will be the role of religion in Republican politics. The evangelical base has been a key part of the political coalition that has brought the party such success in recent years. Political guru Karl Rove cemented evangelical ideas into President George W Bush's brand of conservatism and used them to inspire a very effective 'get out the vote' team in elections.</p> <p>Rove focused on social issues such as gay marriage and abortion as a way of ensuring fanatical evangelical support. Nothing came to symbolise the power of the evangelical movement more than the rise of mega-churches, especially in staunchly Republican areas. These enormous edifices now dot the landscape of many states and Texas is no exception.</p> <p>In the northern Dallas suburb of Prosper, a new mega-church has just opened. It is called Prestonwood North and is a branch of its mother church a few miles south in Plano, a fast-growing city of some 260,000 people. At first glance the church looks like a sparkling new office development, identical to many other buildings popping up on farmland as these 'exurbs' of Dallas succumb to development. But the large cross on its front reveals the truth. Taken as a whole, Prestonwood now has almost 30,000 members, making it one of the largest churches in America. It was recently named as one of America's 50 most influential churches.</p> <p>It certainly fits in in Prosper. Once a hamlet, it is gradually being swallowed by the suburbs, but its politics remain God and guns. 'People around here all voted for Bush. That has not really changed. It's a churchgoing kind of place,' said Michelle Williams, 32, a dental nurse.</p> <p>In Texas, church and politics have been mixing. In recent weeks, leading evangelical leaders in the state have endorsed McCain from their pulpits. They include Pastor Gary Simons, who heads a church near Dallas. He compared Obama to King Herod, the biblical child killer, because of his support for abortion. 'How many of you would want to go to the polls and vote for Herod?' Simons asked his congregation. </p> <p>But increasingly such nakedly political preaching is looking out of step with many religious voters. Obama, who is a regular churchgoer and looks at ease in religious surroundings, has made huge strides in appealing to evangelical voters. His campaign has aggressively courted the religious vote, holding regular meetings with evangelical leaders.</p> <p>That is in marked contrast to the 2004 Democratic nominee, John Kerry. It has worked too. A recent survey showed Obama and McCain in a virtual dead heat among born-again Christians, with support for McCain running at 45 per cent and Obama on 43 per cent. In 2004, Bush won 62 per cent of that vote. 'If Obama goes on to win, one of the significant stories will be the profile of the faith vote ... the Democrats are poised to make up significant ground among born again and evangelical voters,' said David Kinnaman, president of the evangelical research group that carried out the poll.</p> <p>The trend is also likely to reflect growing differences in the evangelical movement itself; changes that are leaving the Republican party behind. Far from being a monolithic bloc, evangelicals have increasingly embraced a wider variety of causes. Some are just as likely to campaign on fighting Aids and issues in the developing world as to crusade against abortion and gay marriage. One of the hottest topics in conservative Christianity at the moment is environmental conservation and global warming, neither of which is a Republican strong suit.</p> <p>Yet, following a possible November defeat, the Republican party itself could still remain firmly in the hands of its conservative evangelical wing. Even as America drifts away from causes that right-wing evangelicals care about, the Republican base remains fixated on them. After all, McCain was forced to court the evangelical vote in order to secure the nomination himself. </p> <p>To cement his position, he ended up choosing Palin - a true religious conservative - as his running mate. That move electrified die-hard Republicans but turned off other voters for whom the collapsing economy - not fighting the teaching of evolution in schools or banning abortion - has become the overriding concern. It allowed Obama to seize the vital middle ground. </p> <p>'In the Republican party itself it seems that the Christian right is going to be in the ascendancy. But that is looking like a losing political strategy for the future,' said Bowler.</p> <p>There is increasingly a sense that what works for the Republican base no longer works for the rest of the country, even in the heart of red state America. Take Kingfisher, Oklahoma. The town sits in the middle of a county that is one of the reddest in America when it comes to presidential politics. It voted for Bush over Kerry in 2004 by a staggering 85 per cent to 15 per cent. Even now the state of Oklahoma remains spectacularly loyal to the Republicans. The most recent poll showed McCain 24 points ahead of Obama. A previous one gave him a lead of more than 30 per cent.</p> <p>But even in Kingfisher the signs of Republican disarray are not hard to find. Businesswoman Charlene Franks is put off by the campaign that McCain and Palin are running. 'I am voting for McCain but I don't really like it. It's the economy that matters right now and groceries are getting expensive. We really don't eat that much any more,' she said. Her views on Palin were not complimentary either. 'She is not ready to be president,' Franks said.</p> <p>Ready or not, Palin is still likely to be one of the most dominant forces in Republican politics after the election. Unlike McCain, she draws thousands to her rallies. She has developed a genuinely enthusiastic following among activists who are dedicated to her cause. Already there is speculation that Palin, if McCain loses in November, will be the hottest pick for the nomination in 2012. </p> <p>That will be made easier by a large-scale electoral defeat. In a process reminiscent of the Labour party in the 1980s and the Conservatives in the late 1990s, the Republicans could end up as an extremist rump, reduced to a few stronghold states and obsessed with causes that seem not to matter to the general public. </p> <p>Across America, moderate Republicans are facing a tough battle as the Democrats look set to increase greatly their strength in Congress. Some analysts are seeing Democratic gains of up to nine Senate seats and 30 seats in the House of Representatives. In a leaked Republican party document last week, an incredible 58 House seats were ranked as potentially at risk with 11 of them virtually written off as already lost. </p> <p>If the Democrats perform strongly enough to control 60 Senate seats then they would have a virtual free rein over the political landscape. Republicans would probably survive only in their heartland, thus thrusting the party further right at a time when the country has shifted left. That would mark a profound change similar to Ronald Reagan's win in 1980 which seemed to usher in a conservative-dominated era. </p> <p>The possibility has many Republican pundits terrified. 'The end of the Reagan era?' blared one headline in the political magazine National Journal. The Wall Street Journal added fuel to the fire with an editorial that went ever further. 'Get ready for change we haven't seen since 1965 or 1933,' it warned under the headline: 'A liberal supermajority'.</p> <p>Such a prospect angers conservative Republicans. But much of that anger is directed at the current occupant of the White House. For eight years Bush preached conservatism from the Oval Office. He spoke of a desire for small government, limited spending and an emphasis on social issues such as fighting abortion. Instead the size of government has increased - mostly due to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security - and spending has rocketed because of Iraq and Afghanistan. </p> <p>On social issues, Bush has delivered a more conservative Supreme Court but abortion remains legal. In a final blow to conservative ideals, the economic crisis has seen Bush's administration preside over the semi-nationalisation of swaths of the financial services industry.</p> <p>No wonder there is anger on the streets of places like Gainesville. After all, the Texas town backed Bush in 2004 with 79 per cent of the vote. Now its people feel they did not get what they voted for. 'There's been no leadership. I liked Bush as a man. He was not very polished, but that was part of his appeal. But things have not turned out well,' said Bill Wilkinson, a writer, as he walked past a cafe on Gainesville's town square. </p> <p>Of course, it is still premature to declare an Obama victory. 'Anything can happen. But the election is clearly Obama's to lose,' said Kinnaman.</p> <p>McCain has built a long political career on unlikely comebacks. He might yet pull off the biggest surprise of his life. But for the moment the signs are grim across the Republican heartland. </p> <p>From Kingfisher, Oklahoma, to Gainesville, Texas, and far beyond the mood is sour. 'I guess it looks like Obama is going to make it,' said Farquhar. 'But no one is happy about it. It is going to be beyond just having another tax-and-spend liberal in office.' </p> <p>That will be for the future to decide. But for the moment it looks as if Obama and the Democrats are preparing for the highest office in America, to add to their control of both House and Senate. The Republicans, meanwhile, are bracing for what could be a painful period of exile.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday October 29 2008.

  "<p>When there's a landslide, you can feel the earth shake beneath your feet. And - goodness! - are those Rupert Murdoch's knees I see knocking in the distance?</p> <p>Last week the trickle of American editorial columns revealing their election choice turned to a flood: 105 for Obama versus a paltry 33 for McCain (when Editor and Publisher magazine did its sums). That's already 10 million circulation copies versus 2.5 million. And it gets worse for the Republicans with every passing publication day. The press and the polls chime as one. Hail to commander-in-chief Barack.</p> <p>But what's this big vote - 702,000 copies' worth - going in the other direction? Why, that's Murdoch's New York Post. And don't dare forget Fox News, with its fawning Sarah Palin interviews, rabid comment panels and general curl of a non-liberal lip. The outward and visible Murdoch isn't turning Democrat this time around. Rather, it seems, he's sticking his chin out and putting the boot in to the last.</p> <p>Except that this is also where you hear those knees knocking - or, at least, the sound of an old Aussie thumb getting a terrible sucking. Of course, the mighty empire isn't monolithic to begin with. Murdoch's Post may have endorsed McCain weeks ago, but his Times of London has publicly gone down the Obama track (just as it took a different tack from its Sunday sister last British time around). Come to think of it, didn't Rupert himself go wooing Obama to do Fox interviews in the teeth of growls from the channel's charismatic supremo, Roger Ailes? Isn't 'fair and balanced' the somewhat risible Fox slogan anyway?</p> <p>For there is, looking closer, a sub-text here that instructs on the real nature of the relationship between Citizen Rupe and the political classes. Call it an uneasy stand-off. News Corporation, the mightiest and most opinionated media giant on Earth, couldn't keep its erstwhile hero, George W Bush, aloft in popularity polls. Neither - despite much nudging - could it make Hillary Clinton a nomination winner. The force was with Obama, and no amount of condemnation, questioning or simple propaganda could blow it away. </p> <p>One landslide, moreover, can lead to another. Suppose a walloping Obama victory is paralleled by a similar triumph in Senate and House races. Suppose a new Democratic President is master of all he surveys and, for a time, very popular. Fox will then appear defeated itself, neutered, no longer cock of the TV walk - and there's another grisly threat in waiting.</p> <p>The New York Post itself has one premonition of doom. It carries an opinion piece from a notable right-wing campaigner, Brian Anderson, raising the spectre of a new Fairness Doctrine and eponymous Act. From 1949 until the advent of Ronald Reagan, the old Fairness Act kept radio and TV stations roughly in check. It didn't enforce an impartiality that would have kept the BBC awake at night, but it did guarantee some kind of access and overall balance on the airwaves. Now - backed by favourable summer polls, with 47 per cent in favour and 39 per cent against - it could be on its way back.</p> <p>Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, would like mandatory fairness prescribed by law again. Others at her side fancy community boards charged with making sure that the large chain stations put down roots in the cities they dominate. Obama himself is said to favour renewing radio licences every two years, not letting them lie for eight at a time. Perhaps he doesn't favour the whole fairness package, but he surely wouldn't veto it if his Democrats on Capitol Hill went their own ways. Cue unimaginable horror.</p> <p>'A new Fairness Doctrine would drive political talk radio off the dial,' quavers Anderson. 'If a station ran a big-audience conservative programme... it would also have to run a left-leaning alternative'. But, since nobody listen to liberal radio, 'stations would probably have to trim back conservative shows to avoid airing unsuccessful liberal ones'.</p> <p>It may seem a baroque sort of censorship, but it's out there, waiting for an Obama administration - and there's nothing even Murdoch can do about it apart from smile nicely. The larger your corporation, the wider your spread of interests - and the more vulnerable you become. Fairness and balance tests for 'fair and balanced' Fox News? It could be a killer blow. 'We will fight to the end for our ability to put occasionally controversial, offensive and even tasteless content on air,' says Peter Chernin, News Corp's chief operating officer. </p> <p>But don't fight the inevitable, so expect rather more than 100 days of dulcet acquiescence. Expect a benign Wall Street Journal, a muzzled Post and Fox News for once actually doing what its slogan claims. Will that stave off doctrines of right-wing despair? Possibly, for the most part. The 105 Barack endorsees don't love Rush Limbaugh and friends, but they'll be anxious about Washington telling them what to do. There'll be a natural press and TV majority crying 'hands off'. </p> <p>But nobody - least of all Mr M - will be putting the knife in. Keep Roger Ailes in quarantine as balanced threat meets excruciatingly balanced response.</p> <h2>Wapping displays a lack of joined-up thinking over the internet</h2> <p>There are two key races in the newspaper world. One is traditional: that for print copy circulation. The other is rather more mystic: how many unique users drop in to your website? This second battle has two great leaders, the Guardian and the Telegraph</p> <p>In September, the Guardian topped 24 million and the Telegraph hit 22.9 million, record figures clearly boosted by mordant credit crunch checkers (which meant an extra million UK-based visitors - 9.8 million in all to the Guardian site and 7.2 million domestic users for the Telegraph</p> <p>But there's an issue here as well as simple statistics. The two front-runners have ploughed huge money into development and integration, bringing newsrooms and journalist teams together to mount a powerful, constantly updated service. But where's the Times in all this? It's number one for financial readers in print, comfortably beating the FT; yet, in crunch September, it could only finish a relatively distant third with 20.3 million unique users. </p> <p>That was a record, too, but still a pretty non-integrated one. As September ended, the online chief for both the Times and Sunday Times - the feisty Anne Spackman - found herself moved over to run Times comment, to be replaced by two editors, one for the daily, one for the Sunday. </p> <p>A pretty clear signal. The Sunday Times is too rich and grand to want its staff to work around the clock, and the Times also seems to like being alone. But can determined non-integration deliver the goods that working together appears to provide? It would be very odd to find Wapping standing on its dignity and shifting sands at such a crucial time.</p> <h2>Blogging and the Beast</h2> <p>So it's farewell lone blogger, the big battalions have got you. Or so Paul Boutin finds in the latest edition of Wired. 'Scroll down Technorati's list of the top 100 blogs and you'll find personal sites have been shoved side by professional ones. Most are essentially online magazines ... and a stand-alone commentator can't keep up with a team of pro writers cranking out up to 30 posts a day'.</p> <p>Enter, pat on cue, Tina Brown and <a href=\"http://www.Thedailybeast.com\">Thedailybeast.com</a>, which is so much like a magazine that it cost a reported $18m to launch. Can online possibly sustain an investment like that? Ah! hello again, lone blogger ... at least you're cheap.</p> <h2>A change in weather for public service</h2> <p>Huge tomes are constructed these days trying to define public-service journalism, but here's a two-minute test (courtesy of Mikhail Gorbachev's World Political Forum and a recent conference of editors and climate-change editors from all over the globe).</p> <p>'Because investigative reporting is time and resource consuming, news organisations should make an ethical and financial commitment to reporting climate change. We understand that making such a financial commitment is a challenge ... but we should make a fundamental change from the current situation, where too few news organisations have reporters who understand science and how it works.'</p> <p>Simple question for the editor, then? Who's covering global warming for you, and what credentials does he or she have? That's public service.</p> <h2>Playing dumb</h2> <p>What does a union general secretary do when he's got members on both sides of a dispute? He plays dumb, or 'slightly bemused'. That's Jeremy Dear of the National Union of Journalists, implicitly siding with his BBC members rather than his regional press membership in the row over local Beeb ultra-local internet sites. Can't see the problem, says Jeremy. The BBC doesn't take ads, does it?</p> <p>No, but it takes readers away from the local papers whose newsrooms supply much of BBC content. And when readers go, ads go. Surely Mr Dear can see the problem? If he can't, then his members on both sides have a problem, too.</p>",
  "<p>In a recent interview, Daniel Craig claimed Barack Obama would make a better James Bond than John McCain. Parade magazine quotes the star of Quantum of Solace as saying: 'Obama would be willing to quite literally look the enemy in the eye and go toe to toe with them.'</p> <p>A moment's thought and I recalled where I'd recently heard someone else wanting to go 'toe to toe' with the enemy. It was the First Minister's challenge to the Prime Minister when launching the SNP election campaign in Glenrothes. Conjuring up a mental image of Alex Salmond as 007 is probably not to be advised, but it triggers the question as to whether recent events, global and local, have left the First Minister shaken or stirred.</p> <p>We can be confident that Salmond will never publicly display any sign of being troubled. But the financial and economic shockwaves of the last month have undoubtedly put him on the back foot. It wasn't his political opponents who first drew the Icelandic experience into the debate on Scotland's future. Look at the ministerial blogs posted on the website of the Scottish government's National Conversation last St Andrew's Day. </p> <p>Finance Secretary John Swinney exhorts Scotland to match Iceland's performance; Enterprise Minister Jim Mather casts his eyes to 'Iceland to the north' as part of the 'arc of prosperity' to which Scotland must aspire; even Education Secretary Fiona Hyslop says that 'we need only look to Iceland' if we wish to see employment benefits.</p> <p>In the aftermath of Iceland's banking failure, Salmond can't reasonably cry 'foul' if his opponents question the soundness of his case by pointing to the weakness of his chosen example. In any event, even before the crash thrust that country into the headlines, Iceland was experiencing inflation of more than 14 per cent, a depreciating currency and interest rates higher than 12 per cent. Was that the performance Swinney hoped an independent Scotland would match?</p> <p>Nor has the case for independence been helped by the falling oil price. At $120 per barrel, accountants Grant Thornton calculated a Scottish budget surplus of \u00a34.4bn. Running the same economic model with oil at $75 per barrel produces a deficit of \u00a3800m. Even if the balance is made more favourable by a price rise, following Opec's decision to cut production, dependency on a yo-yo oil price isn't a recipe for financial stability. In a time of financial crisis, stability isn't something to be tossed aside.</p> <p>Salmond has also looked increasingly uncomfortable as events have unfolded involving Scotland's two leading banks, especially when Gordon Brown has been receiving the plaudits for his bank rescue plan. In the aftermath of the announcement of a merger between Lloyds TSB and HBOS, the First Minister played the straight bat expected of him and sought to maximise jobs for Scotland and minimise the downside. But the straight bat isn't his stroke of choice, certainly not when he has to address the party faithful in conference and there is a crucial byelection in the offing. His default mode is to be stirred - better still, to be stirring. </p> <p>And Gordon Brown's attack on the SNP case for independence let him off the hook. He could now deliver the jibe about the 'sub-Prime Minister' - as clever as it was obvious. He could now alter his position on the merger between Lloyds TSB and HBOS, conveniently citing the changed circumstances of the UK government's rescue package.</p> <p>Into his stride, Salmond links the blame for the origins of the financial crisis with the replacement of Trident and demands \u00a31bn from Westminster to help Scotland cope with the looming economic crisis.</p> <p>So in the face of doubts and questions, Salmond deploys attack as the best form of defence. For all he has accomplished in government, he still relishes the freedom of opposition, not least when challenging Labour in its heartland. But even leaving aside the obvious change in the political and financial environment since July, Glenrothes is different from Glasgow East: the raw anger has gone; Labour now has a full-time Scottish Secretary, relishing the challenge of his appointment; Gordon Brown is a Fifer and a neighbour; and the SNP cannot play on grievances against the council.</p> <p>Unlike Glasgow East, the SNP candidate is not an opposition councillor, but the leader of SNP-led Fife council. Already, uncertainty over future funding of the SNP national policy of free school meals for all pupils in the first three years of primary school has emerged as an election issue. A number of councils claim they do not have the money to deliver the free meals from August 2010, even though the commitment is expressly set out in the agreement reached between ministers and Scotland's local authority representatives last year. This may well foreshadow a testing time ahead for the much-vaunted 'concordat'.</p> <p>Heading into the conference season last month, Glenrothes looked like a lost cause for Labour and there was every possibility the Prime Minister would go with it. But the political kaleidoscope has been shaken up. There has been a shift in expectation. It is Salmond who now 'must win'. But if, having issued his 'toe-to-toe challenge', the First Minister is tempted to cast himself in a 007 role, he might well reflect on another recent comment by Daniel Craig: that James Bond was 'still too headstrong and doesn't always make the right decisions'.</p> <p>\u2022 Lord Wallace of Tankerness is former leader of the Liberal Democrats in Scotland</p>",
  "<p>I thought John Prescott was bound to shout at me, if not throw punches. He has a history of bullying women journalists - he gave my colleague Rachel Cooke a hard time and once actually summoned the Times's Mary Ann Sieghart to his office so he could shout at her. Given that I recently reviewed his autobiography, Prezza, with something less than rapture, I fully expected to get the same treatment - he might conceivably have resented the description 'bog-standard illiterate bruiser'. But actually he had a great beaming smile stitched to his face almost the whole time I was with him; I found it disconcerting. Something else I found disconcerting was the habit first recorded by Rachel Cooke. When she met him, he hoiked one leg over the arm of his chair so that what she politely called his 'pelvis' was pointing at her like a gun. She said it was like a Desmond Morris seminar on mating. I assumed he did it because he fancied Rachel, but then he did exactly the same with me. He looked so uncomfortable, I wanted to say, 'There, there, you've shown us your impressive manhood - now sit up straight.'</p> <p>His office at the House of Commons is the sort of den any schoolboy would envy. One whole table is covered with model ships and planes, there is a line of model trains on the window ledge, and paintings of the cruise liners he worked on around the walls. There are also pictures of Ernest Bevin and Clem Attlee, a statuette of Nye Bevan, another of a miner - I think if you saw the room on Through the Keyhole you might guess it was Prescott's. He proudly shows me a tiny paper cup that was taken from the wreck of the Titanic - the water pressure reduced it to thimble size. He seems absolutely determined to be friendly.</p> <p>But, of course, he has something to plug, a new two-part BBC documentary called Prescott on Class. Despite the unenticing title, I loved it. What makes it great is not so much Prezza, who bangs on predictably about being working class, but Pauline, his wife, who is completely lovely and will have television producers beating a path to her door. (Prezza says a few have already tried, but she's not interested.) At one point she and Prezza go to meet a genuine toff, the Earl of Onslow, and Pauline giggles to the camera about whether it's all right to tell a Lord his flies are undone. At home in Hull, she shows us her famous downstairs loo that she was having installed just when the Tracey Temple scandal broke. Prezza got warning that the tabloids were about to run the story of his affair and dashed home to Hull to tell Pauline - she was hurt not only by his infidelity but also by the fact Tracey was someone she regarded as a friend. He said they must do a moonlight flit to Dorneywood, his ministerial retreat in Buckinghamshire, because the house would be surrounded by paparazzi in the morning. Oh no, she said, she'd got the builders coming to do her new loo, and no way would she abandon that; so she stayed at home with the builders and he went off to Dorneywood alone. Later she had a party to unveil the new loo - 'It was like Clochemerle,' says Prezza. Actually, says Pauline, it is not polite to call it a loo, or a toilet; the new posh word is 'lavatory'. Unlike Prezza, she seems to have no rancour about class, but regards it as a bit of a joke. And she reveals that actually, Prescott's family was quite posh by her standards, because they lived in a semi-detached whereas she lived in a terrace.</p> <p>Prezza's class chip is really weird - how can he keep whingeing on about being 'disadvantaged' when he was deputy prime minister for 10 years? What does he think he would have been if he'd been born into the middle class? Prime minister? King? He says it all started with him failing the 11 plus - his father promised him a bike if he passed, but then he didn't get it and it rankled. I think actually what he resents is his lack of education. He left school at 16 with no qualifications, but then became a ship's steward and organiser for the National Union of Seamen. They eventually sponsored him to go to Ruskin College, Oxford, then to Hull University. So he did get an education, but a late one. He says in his autobiography that his two years at Oxford were the happiest of his life - although he also says he worked so desperately hard he never even visited the other colleges. But perhaps Oxford gave him a vision of the sort of gilded student life he might have enjoyed if he had only passed the 11 plus. </p> <p>He hates it when people laugh about his appalling English. He was furious when Simon Hoggart compiled a whole book of Prescottisms, some of which he claims Hoggart made up, though he admits to uttering the immortal, 'The green belt is a Labour achievement and we intend to build on it.' His TV producer cunningly brought him face to face with Hoggart at the Hay Book Festival and Hoggart told him in a kindly spirit that his problem was he spoke too fast, so his words tumbled over each other. But, actually, I noticed another problem with Prescott and language. While I was with him, I thought that, though much of what he said was boring, I had no trouble understanding it. But when I came to transcribe the tape, there were whole paragraphs - nay, pages - I had to jettison as completely unintelligible. I'd understood him while he was talking, but his words made no sense on the page. So whereas I would never normally alter a quote, with Prescott I have had to carve a path through the thickets of verbiage to convey what I hope was his meaning.</p> <p>I started by saying that although I didn't like his book much, I loved his television programme. Typically, he ignored the compliment and picked up on the criticism. 'What didn't you like about the book?'</p> <p>'I thought it was pretty shallow. How long did you spend on it?' 'Well, not very long. But what did you want from the book? I'll tell you what I wanted from the book. [Typical again - he asks a question, doesn't wait for the answer.] I think I've done quite a few things in my time - not that the press have ever given me credit for it - and I wanted to put that on record, so that was quite useful. And I did have a life before politics which I wanted to put in. And it was to correct some of the image that's painted of me by the press. I assume I've confirmed some of the image, for instance, putting up two fingers outside Number 10 - people can say you shouldn't be deputy prime minister and do that kind of thing, and if you've got the view that perhaps I'm not an ordinary kind of guy, perhaps you might be offended by that.'</p> <p>Mmm. Anyway, I reminded him, I did enjoy the television programme. There is a hilarious scene when Prezza is taken to meet three chavs, and asks the producer en route what chav means. She defines it as meaning 'council house and violent' (news to me) but anyway, the girls he meets say they're not chavs, they're middle-class. 'You can't call me working class,' says one unanswerably, 'Cos I don't work.' Prezza is sweetly puzzled by these girls, who run rings round him intellectually, but what is impressive is his desire to understand them. He really wants to get to the bottom of their problems. One of them says she got kicked out of school for violence. 'Someone attacked you?' he asks. No, she explains patiently, she attacked the teacher.</p> <p>The only reason the girls knew who Prezza was is because they saw him on television punching a man who threw an egg at him which, of course, they admired. Prezza in his autobiography seems to regard the punch as his finest hour, though he had a good whinge to me about how this 40-second incident seemed to be the only thing anyone remembered out of his 40-year career. I tried to explain that perhaps it sets a bad example to the young for the deputy prime minister to go round throwing punches - it might for instance lead to 14-year-old girls thinking it was OK to hit teachers. 'Hang on, hang on. What am I supposed to do then - take the belt? Some of the sisters [Harriet Harman and co] took that view down here.'</p> <p>'I agree with them.'</p> <p>'Well I think you're probably one of the sisters then. What would you do if you got belted by a fella?'</p> <p>'Scream. Call the police. Certainly not hit him.'</p> <p>'Would you not defend yourself? You'd just stand there and take it like Jesus Christ or something? Well I don't. I do what I did. You can smile like Tony if you like and walk on by but that's not me, I'm sorry. I've lived my life where I have to defend myself. At sea, if you didn't defend yourself you were in real trouble. When six men came attacking me, am I supposed to say, \"I'm sorry, I don't believe in violence\"? </p> <p>I said to Blair, \"If an ordinary guy had done this, what would you have said?\" And he said, \"But you're not an ordinary guy, you're the deputy prime minister.\" To which I said, \"Can't an ordinary guy be DPM?\" I said: \"If that's the case, then take it off me. I don't want it.\" That's the way I am.'</p> <p>Cue violins - I'm surprised he doesn't break into a rendition of 'My Way'. A lot of what he blames on class - like the fact that Blair almost never invited him to dinner at Number 10 or Chequers - I think has a much simpler explanation. You wouldn't want to invite Prezza to dinner not because he might eat peas with his knife, but because he would bore the other guests to death. When he starts on one of his needy, self-pitying rants about class, there is absolutely no deflecting him. Moreover, his vision of class, where downtrodden salt-of-the-earth mill hands groan under the lash of wicked heartless mill owners, bears no relation to modern Britain. All his ideas seem to derive from three texts he read at Ruskin College in the Sixties - Karl Marx, of course, but also Richard Hoggart's The Uses of Literacy and Michael Young's The Rise of the Meritocracy, both of which date from the Fifties. He doesn't seem to have noticed that society has changed since then. He still imagines the working class saving up for their annual Wakes Week trip to Blackpool; it is left to the Earl of Onslow in the TV programme to break it to him that nowadays his gamekeeper takes holidays in South Africa.</p> <p>He says he enjoyed making the programme but he wouldn't want to do it again. 'I'm not a Michael Portillo. I don't want another career. But I was interested in the idea of doing something on class, and I think people might see me as a different personality to the perception that is put across by the media. Did you find that by watching it?'</p> <p>'Oh yes - you seemed more human.'</p> <p>'Well I think I am that. The press always knock me because I don't have a great deal of time for them. They know they're not going to get any stories out of me so that makes it easy for them to be abusive. I'll probably be a bit abusive as well.'</p> <p>Yes, I said, he was incredibly abusive to Mary Ann Sieghart. 'I'm glad you mentioned that, I felt quite strong about her. Here is a woman who believed that I should not be the deputy prime minister because I could not get my English right! She said that to me! She writes all this abusive stuff - she's never even met me. Can you be violent in words? Yes you can. Words can do as much damage as a punch can do, quite frankly. So I asked her to come and meet me and I said, \"Look, you might have a point that I don't get the language right, but perhaps you might credit that I've done some things that are good in my life. But because the language doesn't come right, you think the brain doesn't work or something. And I just think you're wrong.\" But she just maintained her position - she's a bloody snob.'</p> <p>The danger with having a class bias as pronounced as Prescott's is that it can skew your judgement of other people - you might automatically trust people who sound working class and distrust people who sound posh. Does he do that? </p> <p>'I hope not. I would say I tend to trust people until I find I have reason not to. I do think that people who speak with a certain accent and in that loud way - because what private education does is give you confidence above all else - I notice that I'm a bit more wary of them, because of the values I think come with that. But I still work with them. I don't say, \"Because you're from that background, I can't work with you.\"'</p> <p>This was always his strength as deputy prime minister - he was a brilliant negotiator who managed to keep the Old Labour unionists on board while Blair and Brown were pushing through their New Labour reforms. He also, he claims, played marriage guidance counsellor whenever Blair and Brown were on the brink of divorce. Nowadays he speaks very warmly of Brown and his handling of the financial crisis. He also speaks warmly of Blair, though he hasn't even seen him since he resigned. How does he feel about the return of Peter Mandelson? 'Next question.' Did he remonstrate with Gordon Brown? 'He's the prime minister; he makes his decisions; I won't be saying anything.'</p> <p>Prezza leaves parliament at the next election. 'I've done my bit. Not very successfully from your assessment, but I've done 10 years, I was very privileged to have it, and very, very privileged to work with two great guys, Blair and Brown, to play a part in the party's development. I think we've had 10 years of the most successful government for a long time. Where I will play a part, of course, as I am doing now, is to make sure that we can win a fourth term. I owe everything I have to the Labour party and the Labour movement - everything I have was given to me by them - so the least I can do is make sure I do whatever I can to assist in keeping them in government.'</p> <p>Will he go to the House of Lords? 'My wife would like me to. I'm scared to death of doing nothing. But I need to be convinced I can still do something inside the political system. And I like the Council of Europe work I do, there's a lot of environment things I'm doing over there, so I want to carry on with that. I just wonder if you cut yourself off from the Commons, are you finished? I'm not a guy for looking around for a place on a board, but I do want to continue being active.' I bet we'll end up with the spectacle of Lord Prescott in ermine banging on about how his working-class origins have held him back.</p> <p>Oh, his class chip is a bore! More than half the people I interview come from working-class or disadvantaged backgrounds and I have never, ever heard anyone whinge on about it the way Prescott does. Once he starts, he just won't stop, and the only way you can bring it to a conclusion is to say, 'There, there, Mr Prescott, despite your terrible class handicaps you were the longest-serving deputy prime minister in British history, which must prove something or other about social mobility.' (Actually, I think what it mainly proves is Tony Blair's extraordinary patience, but it would be unhelpful to say so.) The line 'longest-serving deputy prime minister' seems to act on Prescott like a dose of Calpol on a baby, and then he quietens down and says, as if the idea is occurring to him for the very first time, that it's true, he has come a very long way.</p> <p>'Tony always used to say to me, \"The trouble with you, John, is you don't recognise you're the prime minister.\" [Presumably he said deputy prime minister.] Well, if that's the trouble, I don't think I've changed. All my seamen guys from the old Britannic, who I meet every year, say I've not changed. I take some pride in that. I'm still the same JP. And I think that's an achievement, not to have been, I think, spoiled by the system.' It's true that the one virtue of Prescott's chippiness is that at least he isn't smug or pompous, like so many politicians. But given a choice between chippiness and pomposity I'd say it's a bit of a toss-up.</p> <p>'I was on the QE2 this week,' he muses. 'They asked me as an ex-Cunarder to take the pennant of the ship in Liverpool cathedral and pass it to the Lord Mayor. They're proud of me as a Cunarder. So I joined her at Liverpool and went up to Scotland. And I was sitting having breakfast as we were coming up the Clyde and remembering exactly 50 years ago when I was on a ship called the Franconia that used to call at Clyde, but in those days I was serving the meal, not sitting there being served. And it made me think of the point you've made about coming a long way and I think you're right. But on that same ship I couldn't go down to the restaurant and walk in on my own - I still can't do that. I can walk on a stage and talk to 1,000 people, but I can't walk into a restaurant and stand there looking for a seat, I get too embarrassed. I think it's an inferiority built in me which I have to admit to, which has led me to react so strongly to people I identify as public school twits. I wish I had their education! The journalist Julia Langdon many years ago gave me a book on English and said, \"Try and learn.\" But I never had time to do that. And I think that has given me a burn on my side that has led to some of the resentment, and then it gets connected to failing the 11 plus and right through. But I think it's a valid criticism that I should have had more confidence in where I'd arrived.'</p> <p>\u2022 Prescott: The Class System and Me is on BBC2 on October 27 at 9pm</p>",
  "<p>'Lately,' said John Updike, 'I've been feeling not so much a wish to die as a wish that being alive didn't generate so many demands.' Sitting across from Updike in a Boston hotel suite with my notebook open, I was the demand, and I have to say that he looked equal to it: now 76, with a wintry shock of white hair, his eyes gleamed in his angular, bevelled face, and his mouth curved in wry amusement. 'You write a book,' he went on, 'and that generates demands, like this interview - though of course I'm sure it will be perfectly delightful!'</p> <p>Incorrigibly prolific as he is, Updike has only himself to blame for the demands that admiring readers make on him. 'Back when I started, 50 years ago, our best writers spent long periods brooding in silence. Then they'd publish a big book and go quiet again for another five years. I decided to run a different kind of shop, on the English model you might say, with a much more regular output. I still want to give my public, such as it is, a book a year.' He is now at work on the book after next, a novel about ancient Rome, which will join the queue for publication after a volume of short stories that is due in 2009. Meanwhile this season's Updike is The Widows of Eastwick, in which the sorceresses from The Witches of Eastwick, published in 1984, return to the rampage, with conjuring sprees in Egypt and China before they revisit the sedate New England coastal town where they re-erect their cone of gynocratic power.</p> <p>'I suppose sequels are inevitable for a writer of a certain age,' Updike sighed. 'When I re-read the earlier book, I was struck by how rich and dynamic it was, if I may say so - by the energy there was in the women and their magic. They're paler now, somewhat filmy. They are crones, after all. But they do less harm this time: they're violent in the first book, they kill a rival. That was my warning to the feminists, since the peaceniks in the Sixties claimed that women in power would behave better than men, be gentler and kinder. If that were true, how do you account for Golda Meier and Margaret Thatcher? Now my widows are trying to atone for some of the damage they did.'</p> <p>Alexandra, the leader of Updike's coven, rejoices at the chance to release her 'inner witch'. Did Updike, I wondered, have his own inner wizard, concealed somewhere beneath his patrician uniform of navy blue blazer and rigorously ironed pants? He chuckled and looked enigmatic. I was referring to his uncanny imaginative empathy, which extends beyond other human beings - the wickedly skittish Harry Angstrom (nicknamed Rabbit) in the sequence of novels that began with Rabbit, Run, the tribe of copulating suburbanites in Couples, or the hundreds of quirky individuals who populate his short stories - to non-human creatures. His recent Shakespearean novel, Gertrude and Claudius, imagines how a horse sees the world, with two uncoordinated eyes looking in opposite directions. Couples transcribes a hamster's fumbling stream of consciousness, and in The Widows of Eastwick Alex fantasises about being a crab, 'moving sideways on tiptoe with eyes on stems', or a barnacle, 'standing on your head in a little folding bucket kicking food toward your mouth'.</p> <p>'Did I actually write a soliloquy for a hamster?' asked Updike. 'Ah well, it's all the same for me. I'm happy to be Rabbit, or to be a crab. Barnacles amaze me - how unlike us they are, the monstrous ways in which the poor things have to contrive to have sex. When you sit at your desk, if you're lucky there's a moment when you feel empowered to be someone or something else, to leap into another skin. It's what Keats called negative capability. There has to be some gap between you and the other life, which the creative spark can jump across.'</p> <p>Updike once told an interviewer that the breezy way in which he surveyed his characters from above as he arranged their futures at the end of Couples gave him the sensation that he was flying. Magicians, whether male or female, surely feel that way too. Was he, I asked, a senior Harry Potter? 'Hm,' he said, not sure whether I was teasing him. 'Rowling - is that her name? - certainly brought magic back into our minds, though it's always been there. What interests me is why men think of women as witches. It's because they're so fascinating and exasperating, so other. There's such a psychological gap between the sexes. The erotic impulse jumps across that distance, like the creative spark. Maybe that's what I meant when I said I was flying.'</p> <p>In the Eastwick novels, magic is Updike's way of liberating the anarchy of nature, repressed and disciplined by scientific laws. The witches worship a 'creatrix', otherwise known as Mother Nature. Darryl, the lover they share in the first novel, pays tribute to this pagan goddess as he splashes with them in his hot tub: he marvels at the fecundity of the female body, able to incubate and expel new lives. This homage to creativity is aesthetic as well as religious. I suspect that Updike, from whom books continue to pour, shares the polymorphous slipperiness and the fertile abundance of his witches. But I found the question difficult to phrase. How do you ask an upright grandfather if he feels androgynous, or get a church-going Wasp to admit that he possesses devilish talents?</p> <p>Updike smiled as my tact got my tongue in a twist. 'Well, I'm reminded of something the prophet Tiresias said after a magic spell turned him into a woman for seven years. He was asked whether the man or the woman had greater pleasure when they made love, because he'd experienced it both ways. He replied that sex was infinitely better for the woman! My three witches are artists - a sculptor, a musician and a writer - because I think that for women living is itself a work of art. I love the way they put themselves together in the morning, the way they prepare their faces - mostly for other women, because men are too crass to notice. Men don't have this aesthetic sense about life; they see it as a job to be done, something to be got through. And I enjoy the fact that writing novels lets me get interested in female things like clothes and furniture and food, all the domestic stuff men usually overlook. So maybe you're right about that.'</p> <p>Down on earth, without a magician's wand to alter reality, I found Updike preoccupied with the obligations of citizenship, anxious about the outcome of the presidential election. His characters keep whoever occupies the White House in their peripheral vision, and often take the cue for their own behaviour from the frailties or vices of the chief executive.</p> <p>In Couples, the assassination of Kennedy is noises off, dimly apprehended by the heroine, Foxy, as she lolls in a dentist's chair; the disaster does not cause the cancellation of a party the wife-swappers have organised for that evening. 'Yes, I loaned Foxy my own memories of that day,' Updike recalled. 'I was at the dentist near here in Brookline, and I remember when the easy-listening station on the radio they played to keep the patients calm interrupted some pop song for the news from Dallas. At first it was just the report of a shot; by the time I stepped forth on to the street, flashing my new crowns, Kennedy was dead and Johnson was being sworn in to replace him. I love that decision to go ahead with the party. Politics was really far from central to people's lives in the early Sixties; it was all about the discovery of the private life. And Kennedy was a hedonist and an adulterer too, of course. I was a na\u00efve boy in those days, a bit shocked to realise that my patriotic and religious values were fading.</p> <p>'Oddly, Lyndon Johnson reminded me of my father, which left me with very mixed feelings about the Vietnam protesters who brought him down. My father was a good teacher but not a disciplinarian; he didn't have the terroristic instinct you need to keep a class quiet. And I made life difficult for him myself, because I was naughty to win the approval of my peers. So I felt guilty about the protests, which wasn't the general mood at the time! It's an unpopular opinion, but I think the President should be respected. It's a terrible job, you can only lose at it. It's an insanity to want it, in fact.'</p> <p>That sympathy even extends to the current incumbent. 'I think Bush got pushed into it, and he'll probably be happy to get out. He gave me an award in 2003, the National Humanities Medal, and I was touched by the way he handled things. He'd been in meetings about Iraq all day, he was weighed down by that, but he wanted to make each of us who were getting medals feel the moment personally, so he had to be presidential - and, for as long as the ceremony lasted, he was.' Updike was luckier than he might have been if he had turned up at Buckingham Palace to be gonged: the Queen would have wearily asked if he was still scribbling, then waited for him to move along.</p> <p>We spoke on the day of the second presidential debate, in which McCain, strutting and frothing, dismissively referred to Obama as 'that one', as if unable to bring himself to voice his rival's suspiciously exotic name. 'I'm for Obama, 100 per cent,' said Updike. He has a personal reason for his enthusiasm: his memoir Self-Consciousness is dedicated to his two half-African grandsons and contains a letter to the boys, assuring them that all Americans are 'of mixed blood'. 'Things have moved on since I wrote that. I now have three grandchildren who are Obama's colour: my daughter married a Ghanaian, and my son has a Kenyan wife. The colour brown has come around, as the song says!</p> <p>'I really think Obama would regenerate this worn-out country. I'm such a believer that I probably won't be able to watch the debate tonight. I get so upset when I think about the alternative. McCain is blameable for choosing Palin as his running mate. She's a bird-brain, she annoys me terribly. McCain himself is worse. You know the way he grits his teeth? Mine grit too as I watch him.' Novelists, like actors, create character by an act of physical identification, which even extends to someone they despise. Opposite me on a couch, Updike's teeth froze, his arms shortened and stiffened, and his sparkling eyes turned wild. The magus momentarily became the grizzled, barking, Republican nominee.</p> <p>I told Updike that both Obama and McCain had nominated him as one of their favourite writers. 'They did? I'd have thought Barack would be reading Hegel, not fiction! And I can't imagine McCain reading anything. He's so irascible, readers have to be patient.' Just in case the candidates were bluffing, I asked Updike to assign one of his books to them as required reading. He made a lattice of his intertwined fingers and sunk his face into it: this is his portable, manual cave, into which he retires to do his thinking. He spent a while perusing his back list, which after all comprises 23 novels, a dozen collections of short stories, an equal number of volumes of critical prose, half a dozen collections of poetry, five books for children, a play and an autobiography. Then he re-emerged into the light, beaming.</p> <p>'Here we go. For Obama I'd recommend a novel of mine called The Coup. It's about an imaginary African country where the dictator pretends to hate the US, though he actually went to college here. The politics were based on Gaddafi - what's he called, not Mohamed, Muammar, right? The joke is how unlike Obama my character is! Now for McCain. I think he should read another novel, Memories of the Ford Administration. It's about an academic who hardly remembers Gerald Ford's term in office because he was too busy committing adultery and researching James Buchanan's presidency. Buchanan was old, tired, ineffective, and failed to prevent the Civil War; Abe Lincoln succeeded him. Maybe if McCain read the book he'd have the humility to realise he should gracefully yield to a younger, brighter man. Or maybe not.'</p> <p>Enjoying the game, Updike was reluctant to stop playing. 'I could assign books to the vice-presidential candidates too,' he chuckled. 'Let's see. Palin is religious and so I am. She should read A Month of Sundays, which is about an errant minister rehabilitating himself in the Arizona desert. Who knows, maybe McCain's ranch is nearby? The book is as goofy as Palin, all brightness and gloss. And I want to give something to Joe Biden, Obama's running mate. He reminds me of the good-natured, diligent guys I grew up with in smalltown Pennsylvania. For him I'd say it ought to be any one of the Rabbit books - maybe the second, Rabbit Redux, in which my deplorable character at least appears as a working man. How's that?' Updike's satisfaction was deserved: in his store there is a book for every occasion, which justifies my belief that he has imagined everyone and everything, prescriptively narrating the lives that the rest of us lead.</p> <p>As I left, news spread of Wall Street's latest giddy lunge into a gulf. 'This credit crunch,' said Updike, 'reminds me of something that Saul Bellow said - that we're obsessed with the afterlife, though we want it now rather than waiting until we get to heaven.' Despite Updike's delight in what he calls the world's 'muchness' - its thronging people, its blossoming vegetation, its rabbits, toads and barnacles - he is dismayed by excess and surfeit, by an American grossness embodied in the waddling obesity of his fellow citizens. Affluence has supplied the wrong kind of earthly paradise; the 'indulgent economy', as Updike called it in Couples, has subsidised our greed. His reference to Bellow reminded me, however, of Updike's own story The Afterlife, in which an elderly American on holiday in England survives a nocturnal fall downstairs which may be his symbolic tumble into death. Next day, reborn, he goes on a trip to the coast, and sees a world made new and radiant by metaphor: electric pylons resemble a host of angels marching across the land. The earth becomes heavenly when Updike writes about it. He has done more to enrich us than all of Wall Street's bankers and brokers, and his books, unlike the papery profits of the Stock Exchange, will not lose their value.</p> <p>\u2022 The Widows of Eastwick is published by Hamish Hamilton this Thursday, \u00a318.99.

  "<p>There it was. Seventy-one inches of raw political rage, a bitter trail of scratched white paint stretching from just over the rear driver's-side window and looping down and across my trunk in an effort to mess up as many parts of my car as possible. In the centre of the scrawl, just to the left of the petrol cap, was a crudely hewn \"O\" with the universal circle-and-slash. Three feet behind it on the bumper, completely unmolested, was my bright blue Obama '08 sticker.</p> <p>\"Dude, I can't believe someone keyed your car!\" my friend said, shocked at seeing the audacious act of vandalism. \"That's the height of douchebaggery!\"</p> <p>I shrugged. \"It means they're scared. They're reacting. They're losing, and they can't handle it. They don't have any good answers, and so they're lashing out like this.\"</p> <p>\"Doesn't that just make you crazy with rage?\" he asked, confused about my apparent lack of concern. \"That's <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2008/01/06/it_may_be_nasty_but_is_it_illegal/?rss_id=Boston.com+--+Massachusetts+news\">a criminal act</a>, keying a car.\"</p> <p>\"I try to keep it in perspective,\" I answered, glancing around the carpark at the gym. An hour earlier, the hideous mark hadn't been there. \"I feel like I'm really 'in the club' now.\"</p> <p>He laughed at that. The anecdotal reports from our fellow Obamanauts have documented a string of petty <a href=\"http://www2.journalnow.com/content/2008/oct/23/shame-on-them/\">vandalism across New Carolina</a>, with cars bearing Obama stickers getting <a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/1565/story/1261675.html\">viciously hacked</a> like this every day. It was an erratic and not particularly successful attempt at voter intimidation. At least I didn't feel intimidated. And I tried to keep things in perspective.<br> A century ago there would have been lynchings and homes afire, doors being busted down at 4am, the kind of cruel guerrilla warfare one tends to associate with banana republics and Asian despots. Even a few decades ago there would have been angry meetings, axe-handle wielding thugs, vicious dogs and fire hoses. If the sum total of politically oriented violence in North Carolina was reduced to a few angry words, a scuffle or two and poorly worded public attacks, well, I had to count that as progress.</p> <p>It's not like it's a new car. A 1998 Chrysler Concorde, its sleek lines bathed in the ubiquitous southern dust and adorned with incidental scratches honestly earned from its 120,000-mile history. It used to be my mother-in-law's car. I borrowed it five months after she bought it to take her daughter on a no-frills honeymoon in the mountains of Virginia. This was the car that carried my oldest boy home from the hospital two years later when she picked us up (my decrepit Isuzu Trooper was deemed too much of a death-trap for a newborn).</p> <p>Five years after that the lease ran out, my mother-in-law sold it to us at a bargain, and for the last four years it has been the Daddy Bus, ferrying my kids to and from school, scouts and endless trips to the grocery store. The once-luxurious charcoal grey interior has been covered with a protective coating of fast-food bags, children's artwork, sticky fingerprints and roughly 100 empty sugar-free Red Bull cans. This was a working car, now, hardly a cherished symbol of affluence. I honestly wouldn't have noticed the scratch if my friend hadn't pointed it out to me.</p> <p>\"You don't seem very intimidated,\" he said, surprised. He was from California and he had been watching the circus that is southern politics with a mixture of amusement and anxiety. Clearly he had been expecting dogs and fire hoses and race riots by this point.<br> \"I'm not,\" I shrugged. \"Like I said: they're scared. And I'm not. I'm not even particularly angry. If my cherished ideas of political philosophy were getting flushed down the toilet every day, I'd probably be scared to. I guess it's because I'm a parent. When I see stuff like this, it reminds me of my kids drawing on the walls. You can get upset about it, but they're just kids.\"</p> <p>\"So these are 'just Republicans'?\" he countered.</p> <p>\"Maybe not for much longer,\" I mused. The Republican party was imploding, already crafting the perfect circular firing squad of blame for the anticipated losses in the election. With the defection of some of the party's more popular, moderate leaders to the Obama camp, the far-right core of the party faced a more and more dismal future every day. Without some strong, central, Reaganesque figure to hold them together and give them a philosophical direction, they were writhing around in a reactionary seizure. I seriously wondered at what the Republican party would look like this time next year.</p> <p>\"Besides, they can't intimidate me,\" I added. \"I voted before I came to the gym. One-stop early voting. There were 24 little booths for filling out ballots. I figured I'd get there Friday afternoon and avoid the crowds. I had to wait a half-hour to vote anyway. The place was busier than any polling place I've seen on election day.\" With that I peeled the \"I Voted!\" sticker they hand out at the polls off of my jacket and carefully placed it on my Obama bumper sticker.</p> <p>\"You know what the best thing about this is?\" I asked my friend. \"Now some McCain supporter just bought me a new paint job. And my mother-in-law the McCain supporter is my insurance agent. So she'll get to fill out all the paperwork on this and reflect about the politics of the moment.\" That had him laughing all the way back to his car.</p> <p>As I drove away, thinking about the experience, I realised that I didn't feel like a victim. This was a struggle, a political struggle between an uncertain but hopeful future and a comfortably corrupt past. People were bound to get scared, lash out, cross some lines. This had been standard procedure for the Republican party for years, and the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/now/politics/dixiecrats.html\">Dixiecrats</a> before them \u2013 but I knew of some militant Obama people who gave as good as they got. In the meantime, I wore my scratches like a defiant badge of pride. The time to be afraid was long over.</p>",
  "<p>I'm a day late to the party on the Ashley Todd story. She's a real sicko. You have to have a lot of poison running through your veins to hatch the idea that you're going to turn the election to the GOP by trying to stoke that kind of fear in white people.</p> <p>Less remarked upon in my reading is how stupid she obviously is too. How dumb do you have to be to forget, or never have known, that mirrors reverse images, so any \"B\" you carve into your own face is going to come out backwards? Just imagine the \"oops\" moment that took place when she finally figured out she'd done that!</p> <p>More seriously, props to Greg Sargent at TPM for <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/mccain_aide_gave_reporters_inc.php\">nailing down the fact</a> that a paid McCain aide -- that is to say, \"the McCain campaign\" -- was pushing the story:</p> <blockquote> <p>John McCain's Pennsylvania communications director told reporters in the state an incendiary version of the hoax story about the attack on a McCain volunteer well before the facts of the case were known or established -- and even told reporters outright that the \"B\" carved into the victim's cheek stood for \"Barack,\" according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions.</p> <p>John Verrilli, the news director for KDKA in Pittsburgh, told TPM Election Central that McCain's Pennsylvania campaign communications director gave one of his reporters a detailed version of the attack that included a claim that the alleged attacker said, \"You're with the McCain campaign? I'm going to teach you a lesson.\" </p> <p>Verrilli also told TPM that the McCain spokesperson had claimed that the \"B\" stood for Barack. According to Verrilli, the spokesperson also told KDKA that Sarah Palin had called the victim of the alleged attack, who has since admitted the story was a hoax.</p> </blockquote> <p>The extent to which the hoax can be tied to the McCain camp is limited, but Sargent shows that it is real. The offending McCain officer, by the way, is named Peter Feldman.</p> <p>Question: Does Todd have a future in the GOP? They'll be mad at her for a little while, because so many right-wing bloggers went so ludicrously out on the limb on this story before it was revealed to be a hoax. But time heals all. I predict that a sympathetic magazine profile is about two years away, and that she'll be an invited guest on a National Review cruise by 2011.<br></p>",

Route 50 more or less follows the course of the Arkansas river, which flows from the mountains across the width of the Great Plains, and all the way to Little Rock.<br> The road is soon bordered by grasslands and herds of cattle. Passing through a small town and badly wanting some coffee, we pull over at the Valley Grocery, a small, old-fashioned general store, sitting opposite an equally small but well kept US post office. In the back of the store, almost hidden behind shelves bending under the weight of rows of cans, a woman with very blue eyes welcomes us. \"You're in Hasty, Colorado,\" she says by way of introduction. \"Population 176 last time I counted \u2014 not counting the dogs and cats.\" </p> <p>Her name is Colleen, and she agrees to talk with us about Hasty. Like a lot of towns across the American heartland, this one is in the dumps. Colleen remembers how the town was once a bustling place, full of workers come to build a dam on the nearby Arkansas river, creating a lake that attracted tourists. Then came the drought, and along with it, a fight over water rights upstream, where the Arkansas provides water to the growing cities of Pueblo and Colorado Springs. </p> <p>The results are in plain view: the river has dramatically narrowed and the lake has gone dry. It's even worse further east in Kansas, where the river has been further drawn down for irrigation \u2014 in places, the Arkansas river, once one of the great western tributaries of the Mississippi, no longer flows at all.</p> <p>Times have been tough here for some time, and seem only to be getting worse. \"The valley is already hurting,\" Colleen tells us. \"It's really scary for the kids that are making minimum wage and driving 25 or 30 miles a day to work \u2014 paying for gas, for babysitters, housing. Hard to watch these kids. It's a struggle. It takes all they've got. They don't have luxuries. They live on $1500 a month - $500 for rent. How can you live on that? They have no health insurance. They can't afford it.\"</p> <p>She says most of the people in Hasty are for McCain, and she herself will vote for him. \"I think they're scared of Obama,\" she says. Sarah Palin is the one Colleen really likes.. \"I think Sarah is the closest thing [to us] that's ever arrived in politics. She knows what it's like. She's got family. They [the politicians in Washington] don't know what it's like to live. They don't have a clue. I'd really like to sit down and talk to that woman.\" </p> <p>Colleen laughs a lot, but she's clearly worried about what future holds for this small, close-knit town. \"This store is 100 years old,\" she says. \"If it weren't for the locals\u2026\" Her voice trails off. </p> <p>\"It's scary owning a store. People going hungry.\" She pauses. \"I would never let that happen.\" She wants to make sure we understand that the locals here take care of one another, are made of strong stuff. We're survivors here. We'll survive anything. Beans and rice,\" she laughs, \"and on Sunday put bacon pieces in it.\"</p> <p>We say our goodbyes and get back in the RV, and Colleen waves as we honk and pull back out onto the highway.</p>",

Pundits loved to play up the idea of a divided nation. In Colorado, you can go from reddest Red State America in Colorado Springs to bluest Blue State America in Boulder in less than two hours.</p> <p>\"(Boulder) is the anti-thesis of Colorado Springs in a lot of ways,\" says <a href=\"http://www.laurelkallenbach.com/lkblog/\">writer, blogger and Boulder resident Laurel Kallenbach</a>.</p> <p>While Colorado Springs is home to conservative Christian group <a href=\"http://www.focusonthefamily.com/\">Focus on the Family</a>, Boulder is home to the <a href=\"http://www.rmpjc.org/\">Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center</a>. While Colorado Springs has the <a href=\"http://www.usafa.af.mil/index.cfm?catname=AFA%20Homepage\">Air Force Academy</a>, Boulder has the <a href=\"http://www.naropa.edu/\">Naropa University for \"Buddhist inspired contemplative education\"</a>. Boulder is so liberal that some jokingly refer to the city as the People's Republic of Boulder.</p> <p>Johanna Stoyva is also from Boulder. She said: \"When I was growing up, it was considered a liberal oasis in a conservative state. But for the last 10 years, the rest of the state has been getting more and more liberal, more and more Democratic.\"</p> <p>Like the rest of the state, this year they are seeing a lot more organising on behalf of Democratic candidate Barack Obama. Although Laurel says \"that in Boulder that working for the Democrats is a bit like preaching to the choir.\"</p> <p>But she is seeing excitement and enthusiasm for Barack Obama. People have gathered either at each other houses or at bars and restaurants with big screen TVs to watch the debate. \"The feeling is much more positive. It's a feeling of 'yes, we can do this'\", she said.</p> <p>Johanna gets a lot of requests for work in her precinct because she lives across the street from the precinct captain. Early voting began this week in Colorado, and she plans to vote as soon as possible to avoid getting frequent calls from get out the vote volunteers, which she says can become intrusive.</p> <p>Also, many Democrats are voting early because they \"feel very uncomfortable\" about the voting machines, Johanna said. \"A lot of Democrats feel more secure that their vote will be properly counted if they vote early and by mail,\" she said.</p> <p>Laurel was cautiously optimistic that Barack Obama will win in the state. She said, \"But I'm nervous. In the past in Boulder, we think we can win, but the last eight years have been a big disappointment. Then we ask, 'How could we have been so wrong?'\"</p> <p>But in Colorado Springs, Colorado conservatives are definitely nervous that John McCain is losing the election. Focus on the Family's political advocacy wing and other conservative Christian groups have <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h0S_-WZ32SLwqlSl84qr8MxA1SbQD9416KHO0\">intensified their attacks against Barack Obama</a>, according to the Associated Press. Focus on the Family Action predicts that under Obama every state will legalise gay marriage, that Russia will return to Eastern Europe and terrorists will strike four American cities.</p>"
