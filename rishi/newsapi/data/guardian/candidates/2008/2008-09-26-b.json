  "<p>American lawmakers inched closer to a deal on a $700bn bail-out of America's teetering banking industry last night after a day of political wrangling complicated by the involvement of presidential rivals John McCain and Barack Obama.</p> <p>Congressional leaders pledged they would work through the weekend to find common ground, after Republicans defied their president by walking away from an initial agreement, fearing a voter backlash over the cost of rescuing Wall Street banks.</p> <p>McCain had threatened on Wednesday to boycott the first presidential debate with Obama in Oxford, Mississippi, last night, but backed off at midday yesterday. He flew from Washington to Oxford for the debate, as did Obama.</p> <p>Both presidential candidates are scheduled to return to Washington afterward. A rescue deal is unlikely until they return, with both parties keen to have their presidential candidates take credit - even if their roles were peripheral.</p> <p>Last night, Gordon Brown said he was backing the bail-out after talks with Bush at the White House. Bush said: \"The prime minister wants to know if the plan is big enough to make a difference, and if it is going to be passed, I told him it is big enough to make a difference, and it is going to be passed.\"</p> <p>Brown responded: \"Britain supports the plan. Whatever the details, it is the right thing to do to take us through these circumstances. America deserves the support of the rest of the world\".</p> <p>After initially falling sharply, shares on Wall Street surged on hopes that an emergency package would be finalised. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 121 points at 11,143.</p> <p>The fresh impetus came after a stalemate on Thursday when McCain and Obama joined talks at the White House.</p> <p>Democrats accused McCain of grandstanding in Washington without playing a useful part in shaping the bail-out. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, said McCain's presence had been \"harmful\" rather than helpful: \"All he has done is stand in front of the cameras. We still don't know where he stands on this particular issue.\"</p> <p>McCain's campaign team said he had only agreed to go ahead with the debate because he was optimistic that significant progress had been made towards a deal. Obama told the press on his plane to Mississippi that progress on the bail-out legislation was being made. \"I look forward to, after the debate, coming back to Washington and hopefully getting the package done,\" he said.</p> <p>A tentative agreement struck on Thursday evaporated after a revolt by House Republicans.</p> <p>With their resolve apparently bolstered by McCain's involvement, these Republicans came up with an entirely redrawn proposal which would require troubled banks to purchase state-sponsored insurance for bad debts rather than selling \"toxic\" mortgage-backed securities to the treasury.</p> <p>The treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, who spent much of the day locked in negotiations with members of Congress, expressed reservations about meeting the rebels' demands, including for restrictions on pay-outs for failed executives.</p> <p>Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the Senate banking committee, said the bail-out in its original form was unacceptable. \"They're trying to push this in an emotional state, saying the sky's falling on our heads,\" he said. \"Every time we have rushed to judgment in the past, we have paid for it.\"</p> <p>But calls for urgent action were joined by two of America's most venerable economic figures. Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman and George Shultz, the Reagan-era treasury secretary, published an open letter saying: \"We urgently advocate immediate, extensive action that would maintain the functions of credit markets and prevent a serious economic contraction.\"</p>",
  "<p>US senator Edward Kennedy, who is being treated for brain cancer, was tonight taken to a hospital near his Cape Cod vacation home after complaining of feeling unwell.</p> <p>However, the US television network Fox has reported that former presidential candidate and Massachusetts senator John Kerry has spoken to senator Kennedy, and says that he is due to leave hospital and return to his home within the next hour.</p> <p>Barnstable police sergeant Ben Baxter says an emergency call from the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port came about 5pm ET on Friday evening.</p> <p>Baxter said Kennedy has been taken by ambulance to Cape Cod Hospital. He says Kennedy had been \"alert and responsive\" during the trip.</p> <p>Representatives of Kennedy and the hospital did not immediately return calls seeking comment.</p> <p>Kennedy had a seizure in May and underwent surgery in June for a malignant brain tumor. After undergoing six weeks of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, he has been increasing his public activity.</p> <p>Senator Kerry said that the Kennedy was looking forward to going home to watch tonight's televised debate between the presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.</p>",

This was just one of several questions that crossed my mind when menswear designer Tom Ford, 47, very handsome if suspiciously unlined of face, arrived for lunch in Beverly Hills on a bright Monday afternoon. (Other mental queries included, were those glinting chest hairs, visible thanks to the almost half-unbuttoned shirt, specially oiled for this occasion?) It felt a little intrusive to ask a man about his medical procedures before he'd even had his iced tea. So I waited until he finished his drink.</p> <p>\"I haven't had any plastic surgery - despite what people think, this is my nose,\" Ford replied, as smooth as his face. \"I have had Restylane and Botox, but I don't think of that as plastic surgery any more. It's true I can't really frown, but I can move my eyebrows, so...\" </p> <p>As well as designing and expanding his eponymous menswear line and getting ready for his first foray into film directing, Ford has been busy this year designing suits for Daniel Craig in the soon-to-be-released James Bond film Quantum Of Solace. But all this multitasking has not muted the man. During the 90s, when Ford rescued Gucci - shepherding it from near bankruptcy when he arrived in 1994 to fashion monolith status, with annual sales of more than $3bn, when he left 10 years later - he was credited with, as one fashion critic put it, \"bringing sex back\". His overtly sexy clothes - LBDs and tight trousers for all aspiring Linda Fiorentinos - brought blatant, confident sexuality back after an era dominated by grunge. </p> <p>Ford, who has been with his partner, former fashion editor Richard Buckley, for 23 years, revelled in his role as the King of Sex, obliging journalists with deliberately provocative comments and commissioning an infamous ad that featured a model's pubic hair shaved into the Gucci logo. </p> <p>A decade on, he has moved away from the high-octane glamour he brought to Gucci and later Yves Saint Laurent (for four years he designed for both, making him arguably the most powerful designer in the world). Instead, his own menswear line, which he started in 2006, is classic and more mature. He has rejected the fashion merry-go-round and trend-chasing that may have left him briefly \"burned out\" but also made him very wealthy (when he left Gucci and YSL in 2004 he allegedly had \u00a390m). If a man wants to know how it feels to wear, and buy, couture, he can now go to Tom Ford: this is a label where five-figure price tags are the norm. Yet Ford is a far cry from a traditional Savile Row tailor. He has multiple homes in multiple countries; he hangs out with \"lots of actors you'd have heard of\", and he is still happy talking about sex, even if he does claim he is \"much less overt than I was\". \"Honestly,\" he insists at one point, \"I never set out to make anything sexy.\" At this point he had to apologise for eyeing me up - \"Sorry, I keep looking at your body because I like how people's bodies look\".</p> <p>If ever there were a designer made to make suits for James Bond, it is surely Ford. Hell, the man even looks like Bond. He first met Daniel Craig through artist Sam Taylor-Wood, \"who's a good friend\" (this phrase comes up a lot), \"at a party\" (as does this). Craig then asked him to make his suits for Quantum Of Solace. \"A lot of people think if you wear classic clothes you're dull. Bond dresses that way, but he does not lead a dull life - not sexually and not in his career,\" Ford says, with delightful understatement. \"And with Daniel, you have someone who looks classic but leads a very exciting life.\"</p> <p>Ford has been described as \"the straightest gay man in the world\". Maybe this refers to his fondness for making appreciative remarks about women's bodies. Maybe it's a faintly homophobic comment about his tough business mind, as though a gay man couldn't possibly do spreadsheets. In any event, if he seems straight, then Graham Norton is Arnold Schwarzenegger. Think Cary Grant in Studio 54 and you have some measure of the man.</p> <p>But this overlooks his corporate nous. At Gucci, Ford wasn't just the label's creative director, he was also the company's vice-chairman. In between designing the multiple collections each year, he contended with shareholders and corporate affairs. Under him, the company invested cannily in young designers, including Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re at Balenciaga, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen. Though Ford insists he takes \"absolutely no credit\" for the success those three have had since, Ghesqui\u00e8re nearly welled up when I asked about Ford and said the designer \"taught me everything\". Ford also bought the then waning Yves Saint Laurent and installed himself as the label's designer, with similar success.</p> <p>He is, he says, \"innately a fashion designer\", but the business side clearly interests him at least as much as the clothes. He enthusiastically discusses the new global markets (\"The next century belongs to China, Russia, Brazil and India\") and flits easily between fashion fabulousness (\"Menswear in France does not exist. What do they have? Pink socks? Please\") and business speak about networks and brand identity.</p> <p>Ford was born in Texas, and grew up in New Mexico and Houston. The son of two realtors, he was a self-described \"spoiled child\" who went to New York to study art history. He quickly switched to theatrical studies to fulfil his ambition of becoming an actor. He became so successful in commercials - at one point starring in 12 at the same time - that he dropped out of college. \"I'm not going to tell you which ones, because I don't want you to look them up,\" he says, but then proceeds to re-enact them, showing the moves one makes when advertising anti-acne cream, shampoo and, to the bemusement of our fellow diners, deodorant. But he soon realised he would never be happy as an actor, mainly because he resented being told what to do. \"I did not like having to read a line the way a director told me to when I thought it was stupid. Or not being able to rewrite the line myself.\" </p> <p>While he was a student, he fell in with Andy Warhol's gang (\"It was very easy to meet Andy and get into Studio 54 if you were a cute 17-year-old boy\") and it was then he realised he was gay. He'd had girlfriends in high school, \"and was very satisfied, but then it was suddenly like, oh!\" he says with an easy shrug. He returned to school and got a degree in architecture, but realised he wanted to focus on fashion and slowly worked his way up the ladder. When he was named creative director of Gucci in 1994, few had heard of him.</p> <p>Ford credits the instant appeal of the sexed-up Amazonian look he brought to Gucci as it \"simply coming at the right time. Fashion in the early 90s was very depressing, after the stock market crash in the 80s, then Aids ravaging the industry. It was time for a change.\" It's hard not to wonder if his embrace of the image was something of a pose. Ford nearly spits out his salad in shock at the suggestion, although he soon relents: \"In the mid-90s, when advertising was less overtly sexual, maybe I did it to provoke a little. But there had to be a message. When I shaved the G in the girl's pubic hair, that was a comment on the ridiculous lengths we'd gone to with branding.\" It's a fair point, but considering Ford was at the forefront of so-called logomania - peaking with the \u00a3505 monogrammed Gucci yoga mat - the words \"cake\", \"having\" and \"eating\" come to mind.</p> <p>In 2004, Ford was unexpectedly forced out of the Gucci Group after negotiations broke down about his contract with Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, which owns 70% of Gucci. Although he puts an all-for-the-best spin on it now, he was stunned at the time and had \"something like a midlife crisis. While I realised I had an identity without Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, my life and work had become so meshed. I'm always trying to make things better, make myself better, and I had a sudden panic of, well, who am I?\" Ford took three months off, quickly realised he hated not working and returned to plan his own label.</p> <p>Part of the problem was that Ford had so embodied his brands: he was frequently photographed at parties wearing Gucci and played the sexual provocateur role. \"I actually hate being in the spotlight, but no one ever believes me,\" he insists, the latter part of that statement at least being true. When Ford edited an issue of Vanity Fair in 2006, he was on the cover, nuzzling a naked Scarlett Johansson and Keira Knightley. \"Honestly, I was not supposed to be on the cover.\" He sighs. \"That picture was taken when I was showing Rachel McAdams [an actor who left the shoot because she felt \"uncomfortable about being naked\"] what to do. But, of course, I liked the picture...\"</p> <p>For someone who \"hate[s] promoting things with my face\", he must be unhappy much of the time. Adverts for his cologne feature Ford staring straight at the camera. \"I understand that I have a certain look that can be used to my advantage. I know the power of that when I walk into a room and talk to people, and I can use it as an advertising tool. Now I am actually selling me, my face, my thoughts. So I am my guy,\" he says.</p> <p>When he launched his label in 2006, it looked like self-indulgent folly to some. Why would someone with such a talent for giving mass appeal to luxury lines run into the narrow niche of, to use Ford's favourite word, exclusivity? Now, however, when most designers are worrying about the economic downturn, Ford's business model looks downright prescient. It's not that he believes the nonsense touted in many fashion magazines that the best form of economising is to buy expensive things because they are \"investments\". Instead, it's that the customers Ford has targeted are people who won't be affected by a recession or, if they are,\"they're buying fewer Warhols but still buying suits\". Currently there are stores only in New York and Milan, but by this time next year there will be 16 more. </p> <p>If Ford defined a new image of women in the 90s, what does the success of his label, with its $17,000 jackets and $4,000 blazers, say about 21st-century men? Well, it certainly says something economically. As Ford puts it, \"Because of the increase of wealth in this world, it is possible to have a new business model where you can reach a very healthy scale of business catering only to a smaller percentage of people - people with, let's be real, a lot of money.\"</p> <p>Ford admits the one thing he missed when he left Gucci was \"not having a voice in popular culture\". Surely, by making his brand so expensive, his influence is somewhat limited? He argues that it's not necessarily the clothes themselves that reflect culture, but the whole concept of the brand. \"I think people are sick of trends changing every six months - not because we're tired of them, but just for the sake of change. There is so much junk in the world: junk TV, junk movies, all those junk magazines with the same people on the cover. Our clothes are about quality and making the man's body look good, which is not something that a lot of menswear designers think about any more.\"</p> <p>Ford, a vocal Obama supporter, ties this proliferation of junk and dumbed-down culture to the current state of US politics: \"We've been in a downward spiral of culture in America for a while. So we've created an ignorance, and I'm just hoping there are more people who [will vote in the US election who] are enlightened than not. I don't mean it to sound arrogant that I call it enlightened: it's just an awareness of the outside world and of the true meaning of religion and not the meaning that has been pushed by the religious right, which is really twisted,\" he says. When Bush invaded Iraq, Ford told a journalist he was \"ashamed to be an American\", a comment that got him a lot of flak but of which he is \"still very proud... I genuinely believe that with Obama we have a chance to undo some of the terrible damage we did under the Bush administration. America is in the position that Britain was a century ago: we will no longer be the economic leader in the world but, with Obama, we can become the moral leader again.\"</p> <p>Does he worry about McCain and Palin's anti-gay rights stance? \"It's more the mind-set that worries me: anyone who is anti-gay rights shows an intolerance of other humans and their needs, so what worries me more is how that mind-set would filter into other issues.\"</p> <p>Ford and Buckley have been in a happy, stable relationship for almost a quarter of a century, \"and it's been a very nice life\". They are not planning to marry, simply because, Ford says, suddenly becoming very passionate, gay marriage is still not recognised by the US government. \"Even though the California government recognises it, if I died tomorrow my estate would be taxed as if I were single by the federal government. That is not right! Until that changes, gay marriage is just a symbol.\"</p> <p>Before meeting Ford in LA, I went to his store in New York. \"Obsessively detailed\" doesn't begin to describe this giant luxurious uptown temple. Put it this way: there is a man who just looks after the bonsai trees. \"Absolutely. Each tree goes to the countryside every seven days for a month to get some sun,\" Ford says proudly. But the store was packed. Yes, some were window-shoppers, but there was one man ordering his winter wardrobe and another getting a $7,500 suit. The obsessive detail and bonsai trees seem to be working. \"I probably do have an obsessive personality, but striving for perfection has served me well,\" Ford says.</p> <p>It is an attitude he also applies to himself. Ford, who once said he has been on a diet since he was 13, spends \"a lot of time looking after myself\". He plays tennis at least three times a week; he does Pilates twice a week; he hikes; he swims; he rides horses on his ranch in Santa Fe; he skis; he watches what he eats and he tries not to drink too much, despite \"loving it\". </p> <p>When we leave, he, ever the gentleman, insists I walk in front and we march out together, him complimenting me on my outfit. It's only when we get to the door and I turn to say goodbye that I see he has put on his sunglasses specifically for the walk past all the gawking fellow customers and assumed the stern \"I'm a celebrity, don't look at me but actually please do\" expression familiar from photos of him on the red carpet. When one is selling a perfect image of oneself, there is no time off.</p>",

  "<p>Susan Cooke Kittredge didn't know that her father was famous until she walked into a restaurant one day and observed strange behaviour in the British ma\u00eetre d'. Born and bred in New York, she was in her early 20s, on holiday in London with her parents, when a waiter at the Connaught started fussing around them murmuring, \"Sir Alistair and Lady Cooke.\" Neither parent seemed fazed. Kittredge, on the other hand, made a dash for the ladies, where she sat in a cubicle and thought, \"What the heck?\" </p> <p>This was the early 70s and Cooke, freshly knighted, hadn't lived in Britain since 1936. For more than 30 years, however, his disembodied fame had grown steadily from his dispatches in the Guardian and weekly Letter From America on BBC Radio. He would eventually become famous in his adopted home, too, from appearances on TV that his daughter says \"were like a balm. People said, 'Phew, there is still an anchor someplace.'\" But that was nothing compared with his status at home, where he became part of the country's rhythm, as reliable as the Shipping Forecast. And if in later years he seemed anachronistic, it was in the best sense of a continuity, an ability to contextualise from memory any world event, so that on September 11 2001 he recalled having lived through the same date in 1914, when the first battle of the first world war took place and 250,000 British soldiers were killed. Cooke would have turned 100 in November, and the response from the old country has, says Kittredge, been \"very heartwarming\". And although she is a mother of five, she retains that air of surprise when considering that her parents had a life before she was born.</p> <p>Kittredge lives in a beautiful house on a lake in Vermont, a place Cooke disliked. Flying, knives, lateness, illness, imagined illness and the countryside all brought out bad temper in him. He was a hypochondriac and prepared for the worst. \"Daddy had a tendency to be scared,\" his daughter says.</p> <p>He would, then, have been horrified by the scandal following his death in 2004, when the New York funeral home the family used was found to be faking permission from relatives and selling body parts, Cooke's among them, to biotech firms. In June this year, the head of the harvesting operation, Michael Mastromarino, was sentenced to 18-54 years. \"But he'll be eligible for parole.\" There is a group action under way from some of the other families, seeking damages, but, says Kittredge, \"We said we're not having anything to do with that. I wanted to be able to speak out about it and never be accused of potentially wreaking some financial benefit.\"</p> <p>Did Mastromarino apologise? \"Yeah.\" She shrugs. The fact that he got away with it for so long is a consequence, she says, of a squeamishness about death, which hands over extraordinary power to funeral directors. \"We are really happy that they come and take [the problem] away.\" There would have to be a \"big cultural shift\" for that to change, but for now she is tired of the subject. For the centenary celebration she wants to talk about her father's life, \"when we have for two years been so focused on his death\".</p> <p>How would Cooke himself have written about it? He was suspicious of tradition for the sake of it. After Jack Kennedy's funeral, he admitted in a BBC broadcast, \"I am not, myself, much disposed to lingering over these mournful rituals.\" He was also resistant to mass outpourings of sentiment. The week of the assassination, while everyone else collapsed in tearful tribute, Cooke gently reminded his audience that, despite the great ideals of the late president, it was useful to recognise \"the very slow translation of these ideals into law... We have to admit that the clear trumpet sound of the Kennedy inaugural has been sadly soured down three short years.\"</p> <p>The irony is that, by emigrating to America, Cooke became a more conventional Englishman than he could ever have been at home. Growing up in Salford and later as a student at Cambridge, he was viewed as flighty and above himself. His father was an iron fitter and a fire and brimstone Methodist lay preacher, from whence came Cooke's lifelong scepticism about religion. His mother ran a boarding house. \"Expectations were not high,\" Kittredge says. \"Somehow he got this injection of energy, curiosity and enthusiasm, and it wasn't going to do well there.\" At university he founded the first society for women actors, as well as involving himself in journalism and creative writing. \"He'd have comments from his professors saying, 'He's not quite focused.'\" </p> <p>Being not quite focused is a basic requirement of journalism, of course, and after going to graduate school at Yale, Cooke became a film critic for the BBC and got a job with NBC news in London, broadcasting a \"London Letter\": a 15-minute talk on British life for American listeners. In 1946 he left permanently for the US where he became the Manchester Guardian's chief US correspondent. His first Letter for the BBC was broadcast in March that year, and continued weekly for 58 years until a month before his death. \"There was space for him here, where perhaps in England some of his exuberant forays were not greeted with enthusiasm. In America, he was not the cowboy; America saw him as what he had not been able quite to be in England.\"</p> <p>In profile, Kittredge looks very like her father, the long, Roman nose and strong chin. Her porch overlooks fields running down to the lake and she says she was as much born in the wrong place as her father was - \"The way transsexuals say they were born in the wrong body.\" She hated Manhattan as a child and longed for the countryside. \"We lived near Central Park and I would bring back all these stray dogs and say, 'Can I keep this?' And he would say, 'Good God, no, get rid of it.' By the time I was seven, I was going to camp in New England for a month, at eight for two months, and then I went to boarding school in Vermont. I'm happier in the woods.\"</p> <p>Cooke was bemused by his daughter. Her mother, Jane, an artist, was Cooke's second wife and is now 95 (\"I warn my children I may be around for some time,\" Kittredge says dryly). After her husband's death, she moved to a retirement community in Vermont where she has circumvented the home's no-smoking rules - you are not allowed to smoke even in the grounds - by abandoning her car in the car park and going out there every day for a crafty fag. The life her parents led in Manhattan for their 60-year marriage was, says Kittredge, full of parties and celebrities, and the energy of a man who never liked to go to bed early. \"The thing people don't know about Daddy is that he loved to laugh. He loved a good joke. The intensity he gave to his work, he gave to play and fun as well. And my mother was always keen. She'd be working all day and get dinner for the kids and be exhausted and at 10.30pm he'd say, 'Shall we go to a jazz club?' She just wanted to go to bed, but she never said no.\" </p> <p>Jazz was one of Cooke's great loves. He discovered it at Cambridge and it was his soundtrack to America: \"This music that dealt with the Depression and gave some sense of hope and joy and melancholy, and it was all wrapped in the geography of this place.\" The morning after one of her parents' parties, Kittredge would creep into the kitchen in their Upper East Side apartment and - \"Oh my goodness, the blue smoke, wading through it to find the cereal box. They were very gay - I miss the word gay in that respect. They were in Manhattan when it was at its height, and he crossed over between serious reporters and the theatrical world, and that made for quite a social life.\"</p> <p>The only famous guest to have impressed Kittredge was James Thurber, because his blindness fascinated the little girl. Were Cooke's standards hard to live up to? She smiles. \"Only if you talked. Only if you opened your mouth. 'Um' would get you your tongue cut out. And my sister always says, 'You know' and it drove him crazy. He would yell, 'I don't know, I don't know! That's why you're talking and I'm not, because you're going to tell me something I don't know!'\" </p> <p>Even to friends, Cooke was known as The Corrector, a name invented by New Yorker theatre critic Brendan Gill. \"He was a real stickler for language and speech, and not much else. Not much else bothered him.\"</p> <p>Not even his daughter's choice of career - she is an ordained minister in a community church with denominational ties to the United Church of Christ. Cooke didn't see that coming; he brought up his children to be as secular as he could manage. \"Both my mother and father were raised in very strict religious households with a view of God as a harsh judgmental deity, and rejected the idea that they would ever do this to their children. That was one of their great bonds. And I don't know if it's the forbidden fruit, but it became this secret thing for me. And because I went to liberal schools in New York, my introduction to religion was through the back door, through art, iconography and literature. And I started going to church when I came to Vermont.\"</p> <p>After the shock subsided, Cooke took it in his stride and even saw that their two jobs had things in common. \"Daddy and I would joke that he would do his sermon every week and I would do mine.\"</p> <p>Looking back, the most striking thing about the Letter is how resistant Cooke was to the sway of popular opinion. His early dispatches focused on the under-reported scandal of the soldiers returning from the second world war, to poor housing and scant provision from the government. During the cold war, he wrote honestly and emotionally of his fears; his tone was always personal, particularly after he went through a period of intense Freudian analysis. During the Watts riots in the 60s, he looked at how the American dream had become not a spiritual state but a function of consumerism. \"We are victims of our own advertising,\" he wrote. </p> <p>Occasionally he overreacted. Cooke disliked bad manners and the hippy movement dismayed him. In one Letter, in answer to the question, \"Who are the hippies?\" he shared findings from \"a limited New York psychiatric study [that] asserts that as many as 60% are seriously sick, mostly with schizophrenia\".</p> <p>He was in the room in 1968 when Robert Kennedy was shot and, although in deep shock, started making notes immediately on a scrap of paper. Ethel Kennedy's eyes, he wrote, \"had turned into cinders\", and \"down on the greasy floor was a huddle of clothes and staring out of it the face of Bobby Kennedy\". </p> <p>The way he wrote the Letter changed over the years; in his youth, when he was still writing daily for the Guardian, he used to leave it to the last minute and \"let the subconscious take over\", Kittredge says. \"But then, as he got older and wasn't doing the Guardian or Masterpiece Theatre [he hosted PBS' showcase of British television for more than 20 years], the Letter took over. It was the week's focus in the later years. Start on Monday, sit down, watch the news, read the paper, and it took all week.\"</p> <p>When people stopped him in the street to say, \"Aren't you...?\" he would parry, \"That's right, I'm Bob Hope\" until the day when a woman replied, \"Isn't that interesting - I'm Mrs Bob Hope.\" (And she was. They both collapsed with laughter. It was Cooke's favourite story.) </p> <p>It was with some relief that, at 95, he finally stopped broadcasting.

The fact, as his wife said, that he \"only used one\" was in keeping with his nature - brisk and to the point. </p> <p>Kittredge will come to Britain at the centenary of his birth for a reception at the American embassy and readings from her father's work at various literary festivals. Her daughter, Eliza, has just graduated from Columbia Journalism School and is working for ABC news in London. Kittredge says her father would have loved this election, and approved of and been fascinated by Obama. In response to a question to which she doesn't know the answer, she still finds herself thinking, \"I'll just call Daddy.\" But then, \"It's wonderful to be able to hear his voice so much. Most people just have a message on an answering machine.\" </p> <p>When it was time to leave the New York apartment in which the family had lived for half a century, Kittredge was crying, but her mother, a woman after her husband's heart, refused to give in to regret. \"It was obviously the end of an era and we were just weeping and Mother, on her cane, was walking out the door and she turned around and said quietly, 'All things come to an end.' \" </p> <p>\u2022 Free with the Guardian next Saturday, October 4: a 36-page collection of Alistair Cooke's classic essays.</p>",
  "<p>What do you do if you are a three times-married struggling single mother called Erin Brockovich and Julia Roberts adopts your name, wins an Oscar for the movie and makes you one of the best known women in the world with a film that has taken more than $256m (\u00a3140m)? Do you: (a) change your life and become an instant celebrity? (b) make some vapid TV shows and write an autobiography, or (c) become one of America's leading environmental campaigners?</p> <p>All three, if you are the real Erin Brockovich, the once lowly-paid, unqualified legal clerk whose investigation brought the giant Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) company to its legal knees - after she exposed how it dumped the carcinogenic chemical hexavalent chromium into unlined pits which polluted drinking water near the desert town of Hinkley, in California. </p> <p>Going back to Hinkley over and over again, she dug out hundreds of people suffering everything from nosebleeds and cancers to Hodgkin's disease, miscarriages and spinal deterioration. She herself got rashes after drinking the water. \"I could actually see people, animals and trees dying. I have been to the funerals,\" she says. </p> <p>Although it is hard to pin specific illnesses on any one chemical or company, the untutored Brockovich - who dropped out of college - succeeded, and it eventually cost PG&amp;E more than $650m (\u00a3350m) in civil lawsuits, the last of which has only just been concluded.</p> <p>The poisoned residents got payouts of about $100,000 each, but Brockovich struck gold. There was a $2.5m bonus and promotion to research director of the law firm; there was a mansion in the Californian hills, and the bestselling memoir. There was a mini-break into TV in the style of Anneka Rice; and thousands of requests from communities around the world to help them, too. </p> <p>But personal dramas carried on following the former Miss Pacific Coast beauty queen around. Within months of the movie coming out in 2000, she had divorced her husband. Soon afterwards another former husband and an ex-boyfriend were arrested and charged, along with a lawyer, with trying to extort $310,000 from her. The lawyer was jailed for six months and disbarred for life, but charges against the other two were dropped. </p> <p>Brockovich admits an equal instinct for trouble and glamour. Perhaps it's the way she stands 6ft tall, and wears four-inch high heels and literally talks down to most men, but she helped shake up the earnest US environmental movement.</p> <p>\"We had this idea of what a hero or an environmental advocate should be. I blew that when I came out with big hair and a bustier. I've been called Rocky in stilettos. But you don't have to have a PhD to be a humanist,\" she says. </p> <p>She now works for two law firms, one in LA the other in New York, both of which specialise in toxic exposure and the kind of mass torts or civil actions used against PG&amp;E. \"I get thousands of emails. Half my work is environment-related, the rest is pharmaceutical problems. There's so much of it. No one law firm can handle it now\". This week she has been in Europe, meeting the Irish environment minister and giving motivational lectures. Her speciality is water, and she is currently fighting two water pollution cases in Italy and Greece. \"It dawned on me then that we were destroying the very element needed for life - water. For me being green means cleaning up the water. Water is the key. Start with water. You can't ignore the fact that that nearly 80% of US waterways are potentially poisoned - benzene, solvents, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals ...</p> <p>\"I get thousands of requests from people near hex chromium sites. There's one in Cork. In Italy there are five. There's a huge one in Greece with readings 10 times higher that at Hinkley. Hell, the river there runs purple! We're about to take out a class action.\"</p> <p>What you really need, and she's got, she says, is stick-to-it-ive-ness. \"It's a noun. It means dogged persistence. Stubbornness. This is what I was taught. I was dyslexic, the least likely to succeed. It means things don't just happen, you have to make them happen.\"</p> <p>Which is why she is currently causing a stir in political circles in the US. Although she rates herself as a leading environmentalist, she is extremely keen on Sarah Palin, the huntin', shootin' Alaskan governor running for vice president with the Republican candidate John McCain. </p> <p>Environmentalists have painted Palin as the arch-enemy, to the right of Bush, because until last week she was denying climate change had anything to do with man, thought polar bears could go live on land and wants to see the Arctic drilled to within a quart of its oil. </p> <p>But Palin is also being called the \"Erin Brockovich of Alaska\" and last week, on her blog, Brockovich came close to endorsing Palin. \"Sure, she may be loud. So am I,\" she said. \"Sometimes you've got to scream to get anyone to hear you. So what if her 17-year-old is pregnant? None of us should judge Sarah Palin for anything but her own actions.\"</p> <p>What about her wanting to drill the arctic reserve? What about the bears and wolves that Palin shoots? </p> <p>\"No buts,\" says Brockovich. \"The fact is that Sarah Palin positively emanates strength. She gives off the aura of being a strong woman who doesn't back down, and she does it sporting heels and wearing her family like a badge of honour. I am sure there are a million other women out there who are doing the same thing.\" </p> <p>The blogosphere went wild, with people applauding or accusing. She denies moving to the right, pointing out that she's a registered Democrat, and says she'd be elated if asked to work with the Democrats. \"But it's not about politics. I don't pick a person because they are a Republican or a Democrat but for the person. I like Obama. I like McCain. Both have strong points\".</p> <p>Her real beef is neither capitalism nor industry, Democrats nor Republicans, she says, but greed. </p> <p>\"It's not that industry is bad. If we shut it down we do not progress. Greed is the problem. If PG&amp;E had done the right thing morally then we'd never have had this lawsuit, lives would have been saved and they would not have been out of $1bn. That's just bad business. Honesty hurts, but it's at least respectful of people. I see no change at all in industry.\"</p> <p>Sometimes she goes back to Hinkley. \"But I prefer not to. The chemical is still in the environment, the plume [of pollution] is still moving. The company is still buying houses there. I am the canary in the mine shaft. I still get rashes.\" </p> <p>The beauty queen once expected to parade and keep quiet now finds herself confused and angered by what is happening in the US and the priorities of people with power and influence. \"We have the money and the intelligence. We can find hundreds of billions of dollars [to bail out banks] but we can't find anything to clean up our water, the one element that sustains all life. I just don't get it.\"</p>",
  "<p>Birmingham should be the scene of a celebration. For the first time in 21 years, the Tories gather for their party conference buoyed by a lead in the polls. In the past few months they have notched up substantial victories, most notably at Crewe and Nantwich and, best of all, in London. They look across at a Labour government eating itself, plagued by the same disease that once ravaged the Tories: rancour, fatalism and insatiable plotting. The inevitable, and heavy, corporate presence at this week's conference will confirm what has long been true: that the Conservatives now give off the smell of imminent power. </p> <p>And yet this is unlikely to feel like a carnival week. For one thing, Conservatives are under strict orders to hide all signs of premature crowing. David Cameron knows how bad it will look if Conservatives are whooping it up while everyone else braces for recession. Tomorrow's planned collective backslap for the string of recent electoral victories has been scrapped to make way for an emergency session on the economy. </p> <p>But it's not just a matter of appearances. The paradox is that this week is both the first conference to open with a poll lead since 1987 - and the first time in 12 months that the Conservatives have been on the defensive. </p> <p>The immediate cause is Labour's relatively successful conference in Manchester. If Gordon Brown had botched his Tuesday speech, the Tories would be licking their chops as Labour plunged into immediate civil war. Instead, the prime minister got good reviews and a modest bounce: the Guardian poll today finds the Tories still ahead, but with their lead cut down from 15% to single digits. </p> <p>That fits with a more nebulous sense, apparent in the coverage of Brown's speech, that the press corps is making one of its periodic collective, if unspoken, decisions to change the narrative. The \"Brown as dead man walking\" storyline has begun to pall. Reporters like nothing more than a contest: if they are not going to get an internal one on the Labour side for a while, then they'll have to make one between Brown and Cameron.</p> <p>But these are only the most superficial of the forces pushing the Tories on to the back foot. The serious and larger one is the most obvious: the world is in economic turmoil. Ordinarily that spells doom for incumbents, and it could well work that way in Britain, finishing off Brown and Labour. But it can also spell trouble for oppositions. </p> <p>The immediate risk for Cameron is that he is simply dwarfed by the scale of the meltdown. One cabinet minister this week said he regarded Cameron as a \"good times\" politician, his smiley, wind-turbine brand of politics fine when the sun is shining but too lightweight for grave times such as these. It sounds wishful, but the minister might have a point. Blair's sunny style, which worked so well in the prosperous 1990s, might not have connected in a recession either. </p> <p>This could explain why Brown's jibe that this is \"no time for a novice\" struck home. Home Office minister Tony McNulty said that at that moment he could feel Cameron and George Osborne shrinking back into short trousers. He was crediting that to Brown's speech, but the real trouser-shriveller is surely the economic crisis itself. </p> <p>For this leaves a party of the centre-right in an awkward spot. Just look at the wild vacillations of John McCain. Ten days ago he declared that \"the fundamentals of the economy are strong\"; come Wednesday, he was warning that the entire system was on the verge of collapse and could only be rescued if he and Barack Obama cancelled their TV debate. After a lifetime spent slashing regulation, he posed as a street-fighting populist denouncing Wall Street \"greed\". The only message he sent was confusion.</p> <p>The Tories have so far avoided similar levels of contradiction, but they are in a corner. The financial lunacy exposed over the past fortnight has blown apart the neoliberal case for the unfettered free market. Publics in both Britain and America now yearn for the referee to get back on the pitch and start imposing some rules. Yet the Conservatives are saddled with a near-religious belief in the free market. The shadow chancellor did indeed say that \"people making money out of the misery of others\" is a \"function of capitalist markets\". </p> <p>The Tories will probably decide that the best defence is offence, and lash out. They will mock Brown for boasting during the years of feast that he had banished famine forever, abolishing boom and bust. They will blame him too, arguing that he should have weathered Britain better against the coming storm, halting this \"age of irresponsibility\" where we've lived high on personal debt. But they can hardly fault him for a decade of light-touch regulation, because they would have done exactly the same. </p> <p>Rhetoric apart, what action might they promise? The Tories surely have something large up their sleeves. How else to explain their silence during this dizzying fortnight. Osborne has form in this regard: it was his bombshell announcement on inheritance tax during last year's conference that shook up British politics, blocked an imminent election and put the Tories out front.</p> <p>Remember, Osborne's move last year included a step that outflanked Labour from the left, seeking to tax non-doms. He could do the same this year by proposing a cap on runaway executive bonuses. If he did, it would be hugely popular, from the Mail to the Mirror. </p> <p>Or might he go even further? The talk of the Labour conference was MP Jon Cruddas's neat proposal to take 580,000 people out of the top rate of tax, effectively leaving only those earning more than \u00a350,000 eligible - a middle-class tax cut - paid for by taking more from those earning in excess of \u00a3175,000. Could Osborne steal that idea, adapting it so that it only squeezed the super-rich, say those earning more than \u00a3250,000 or even \u00a3500,000? I wouldn't put it past him. It would prove that the Tories really had changed and that they dealt in action, not just talk. They could claim to be both popular and progressive - and they would leave Labour floundering. </p> <p>It might not happen. But if the Tories don't come up with something, they will remain on the defensive - and for longer than just one week in Birmingham. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:freedland@theguardian.com\">freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Barack Obama linked John McCain to an unpopular George Bush last night and blamed him for the meltdown on Wall Street, setting the stage for a fiery presidential debate.</p> <p>\"This is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by President George Bush and supported by Senator McCain,\" Obama said in the opening exchanges of the first debate between the two candidates.</p> <p>The blunt words were in contrast to the grins and warm handshakes that opened the debate, and underlined the importance of the encounter in determining whether Obama or McCain will win the White House in November.</p> <p>McCain made a pitch for the votes of independents who would like to see a bipartisan approach to politics in Washington. Adopting a folksy approach, he said he had been feeling badly recently, as had others, about the economic mess. But he said he was feeling better as a result of Republicans and Democrats working together on the Wall Street rescue package.</p> <p>The Republican candidate used this to justify his impulsive decision, earlier in the week, to suspend his campaign and fly to Washington to be seen to be helping resolve the crisis.</p> <p>Last night's debate at the University of Mississippi was supposed to concentrate on foreign policy and national security. But by the time Obama and McCain arrived at their twin podiums, set out on a red carpeted stage flanked by images of American flags, the host, Jim Lehrer of PBS, had put the Wall Street financial crisis on the agenda.</p>",
  "<p>Back in July, behind in the polls and stuck in neutral, John McCain's campaign released its widely discussed TV adverts comparing Barack Obama to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. They were mocked, but helped McCain gain traction. Something rang true to some segment of the American public.</p> <p>If the Obama campaign were as canny - or cynical, take your choice - they would now have adverts out comparing McCain to a mythic character in American film. An ageing starlet, a Norma Desmond whose celebrity has faded but, surrounded by courtiers, persists in behaving as if she were still the cynosure of Hollywood's eye, saying: \"All right, Mr DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.\"</p> <p>As I write, Congress has yet to reach a deal on the Wall Street bail-out. The Democrats and President Bush, interestingly, are largely in agreement and could pass a bill at any moment. But 100 conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives have balked.</p> <p>In this context, it's been a singularly instructive week to observe the candidates' competing management styles. Usually, how a candidate campaigns doesn't really have that much to do with how he will govern. But in this case we've learned far more in the past three days about how each would govern than we Americans usually have the opportunity to see.</p> <p>An Obama mantra throughout has been \"no drama Obama\"-it's the campaign's way of saying he will engage in or indulge no acting out, no internal squabbling beyond legitimate disagreement, no leaking, no grandstanding. He's run a tight ship, and the mantra is credited with having a lot to do with getting him this far.</p> <p>He sometimes eschews drama to a fault, and one could argue he did so this week. I attended a press conference on Thursday night, after the White House negotiations had proved fruitless. He spoke for 10 minutes in a very circumspect fashion, and then answered a few questions in ... a very circumspect fashion. I'd hoped he'd address McCain's theatrics in a straight-on manner. No such luck: \"When you inject presidential politics into delicate negotiations, it's not necessarily as helpful as it needs to be\" was as direct as he was willing to be.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, Obama was apparently trying to play a constructive role. The New York Times reported of the meeting that \"participants said Mr Obama peppered [treasury secretary] Henry Paulson with questions, while Mr McCain said little\".</p> <p>By contrast, McCain has been almost entirely about the theatrics - trying to swoop into town and finagle it so he could either take credit for any deal or (more likely) grandly announce he would regretfully have to \"put country first\" and oppose it. </p> <p>He certainly hasn't been engaged on a substantive level. He acknowledged to a Cleveland reporter on Tuesday he hadn't read Paulson's proposal, released two days earlier and running to all of three pages. Back in Washington, he clearly allied himself with the Republican intransigents. But as the Washington Post reported of a meeting between McCain and the GOP's House leader about the conservatives' alternative plan, \"Neither man was familiar with the details of the proposal ... and up to the moment they departed for the White House yesterday afternoon, neither had seen any description beyond news reports.\" No wonder he said little.</p> <p>Even McCain supporters will acknowledge high finance is not his strong suit. But in this matter, which will clearly consume a great deal of the next president's time, McCain was concerned wholly with how to gain political advantage. He stood before the mirror, awaiting his close-up. </p> <p>Presidential campaigns (and their coverage) can be vacuous enough that it just may work in the short term. Americans able to think longer-term saw that experience and judgment don't always walk hand-in-hand.</p>",
  "<p>It was, according to accounts filtering out of the White House, an extraordinary scene. Hank Paulson, the US treasury secretary and a man with a personal fortune estimated at $700m (\u00a3380m), had got down on one knee before the most powerful woman in Congress, Nancy Pelosi, and begged her to save his plan to rescue Wall Street.</p> <p>Please don't blow up this deal, Paulson pleaded. Pelosi tried to keep it light. \"It's not me blowing this up. It's the Republicans,\" she told him. Paulson sighed. \"I know,\" he said.</p> <p>The exchange - and those in the room said Paulson was only half joking - took place moments after a White House meeting that was supposed to endorse a $700bn bailout ended in acrimony.</p> <p>At the White House on Thursday afternoon were George Bush, and the two men who stand to inherit America's economic mess: Barack Obama and John McCain, along with other congressional leaders. In the 40 minutes the Democratic and Republican leaders sat around a long table, prospects for a rescue package slid from optimism to near despair. </p> <p>\"This sucker could go down,\" Bush is said to have told the group - referring to the teetering US economy.</p> <p>By late yesterday the fate of Paulson's plan remained unclear. One certainty emerged though from several days of drama and suspense: 10 hours before the start of last night's presidential debate McCain abandoned his threat of a boycott and flew to Mississippi to meet Obama.</p> <p>How did it come to this? What happened to a deal that had been so close to fruition before the meeting at the White House? And what was McCain's role, saviour or saboteur? By yesterday afternoon, angry Democrats were accusing McCain of sabotaging the deal to further his own presidential campaign - and even some Republicans were inclined to agree. \"Clearly, yesterday, his position on that discussion yesterday was one that stopped a deal from finalising,\" the Republican whip, Roy Blunt, told reporters.</p> <p>Mike Huckabee, a former rival of McCain for the Republican nomination was also critical of his tactics, calling the threat to postpone the debate a mistake.</p> <p>\"You can't just say, 'World, stop for a moment. I'm going to cancel everything,'\" Huckabee told reporters in Alabama.</p> <p>The intertwining of presidential politics and America's credit crisis began at 8.30am on Wednesday morning when Obama put in a call to McCain, proposing the two candidates suspend their rivalry to issue a joint statement on the bail-out.</p> <p>By that point, it was becoming clear that Paulson's rescue package was playing far better on Wall Street than in the rest of the country. Republicans and Democrats balked at the huge sums to be marshalled by the effort to bail out corporate institutions at a time when voters were hurting.</p> <p>It was also becoming evident to both sides that, with an election six weeks away, a bail-out could be politically toxic.</p> <p>For McCain, the crisis had begun badly. Last week, as the markets were engulfed in uncertainty, he continued to repeat his signature statement: \"The fundamentals of our economy are strong.\" As late as Tuesday, the Republican admitted in an NBC interview that he had not taken the time to read the bail-out plan.</p> <p>But by Wednesday morning, it was impossible for McCain to ignore the economy and the damage it was doing to his campaign. After running in a dead heat against Obama for much of the summer, and with his hopes boosted by his selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate, McCain was confronted with a poll showing it could all slip away.</p> <p>The ABC-Washington Post survey, for the first time, gave Obama a clear lead over McCain, with 52% to 43%. Voters, when asked which candidate they trusted to handle the economic crisis, gave Obama an even more commanding lead.</p> <p>McCain needed to take decisive action. He also needed to make a calculation about where he stood on the Wall Street bail-out. Did he want to be seen as the saviour of an unpopular bail-out, or was there more mileage to be had elsewhere?</p> <p>The Arizona senator waited about six hours to return Obama's call. When he did at about 2.30pm, he mentioned that he was thinking of proposing a delay in the debates.</p> <p>Obama admitted later he thought McCain was just \"mulling over the idea\".</p> <p>But within the hour, his opponent popped up in front of the TV cameras in New York to announce that the urgency of reaching a deal on the bail-out compelled him to suspend his campaign and return to Washington. </p> <p>McCain also threatened to pull out of last night's debate.</p> <p>The talk of missing one of the central moments of any election campaign, guaranteed McCain maximum attention. But what unfolded next did not live up to the Republican's claims that he was sacrificing his own political interests to try to nudge Congress towards a deal.</p> <p>Despite his protestations of urgency - McCain cancelled an appearance on the David Letterman show - he found time for an interview on the CBS evening news. He also went ahead with a speech at Bill Clinton's Global Initiative (CGI) summit on Thursday morning. </p> <p>\"I'm an old navy pilot, and I know when a crisis calls for all hands on deck,\" McCain said during the speech to the CGI in New York. \"With so much on the line, for America and the world, the debate that matters most right now is taking place in the Capitol - and I intend to join it.\" </p> <p>Amid the dramatics, Obama's central argument that US voters should have the chance to judge where the candidates stood on the economy went overlooked.</p> <p>\"The times are too serious to put our campaign on hold, or to ignore the full range of issues that the next president will face,\" Obama told the CGI by satellite.</p> <p>By the time McCain arrived in Washington on Thursday, he was still casting himself as the saviour of the bail-out package, even though Pelosi had been telling reporters for hours that the two sides were confident of sealing their agreement by the end of the day. </p> <p>But the House leader should have noted McCain's first port of call - to the footsoldiers of a Republican rebellion. McCain dropped in on a meeting of House Republicans, who were putting together an alternative plan that called for further deregulation of Wall Street.</p> <p>Those Republicans, led by John Boehner, the minority leader, urged McCain to consider a more freemarket-based proposal than the one that was on the table. McCain carried on to the White House, sitting at the opposite end of a long table from Obama. </p> <p>Their behaviour at the meeting was a study in contrasts, according to press accounts. Obama, granted deference by his fellow Democrats, led off the debate.</p> <p>Then Boehner made his move, throwing down a plan that differed wildly from the one under discussion. McCain, asked for his opinion, stayed silent - and that, according to those at the meeting, was taken by his fellow Republicans as a sign of his support for the Republican revolt.</p> <p>Into that silence, Democrats read a political stunt, designed to allow McCain to cast himself as a populist crusader against Wall Street fat cats on the campaign trail.</p> <p>Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who led the negotiations for the House, called McCain's behaviour part of a battle between Bush and his fellow Republicans. \"I didn't think we were going to have to be the referee of an internal GOP [Republican] ideological war,\" he told CBS.</p> <p>Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, came to a similar conclusion about McCain's role. \"All that happened was the waters got roiled and we had some political theatre. That's not what we need right now,\" he told MSNBC.</p> <p>But the Republican candidate was unfazed, turning around to accuse his critics of injecting unnecessary theatrics into the crisis talks. \"Americans saw a familiar spectacle in Washington,\" his campaign said in a statement. \"At a moment of crisis that threatened the economic security of American families, Washington played the blame game rather than work together.\"</p> <p>The Republican is evidently looking beyond Washington for a very different reaction to his manoeuvring on the economy, and that verdict will not be known until November 4.</p>",
  "<p>The Conservatives have made a series of last-minute changes to their party conference, with David Cameron seeking to adopt a sober demeanour in the face of the world financial crisis and Gordon Brown's jibe about the dangers of handing the keys of No 10 to a \"novice\".</p> <p>The Tory leadership has decided to scrap a video celebration of the party's recent string of election victories in the spring and early summer. Cameron will instead lead a discussion from the conference platform tomorrow on how the Tories would \"ease the pain of the downturn\". One shadow minister said: \"It would be inappropriate for David to be triumphant in the current climate. People want us to be serious and offering reassurance.\"</p> <p>The changes to the programme of the Conservative conference, which kicks off in Birmingham today, reflect how the political mood has altered decisively in the last week as President George Bush has tried to broker a rescue package for US banks. Some senior shadow ministers believe that the prime minister judged the mood well when he warned at the Labour conference that it would be the wrong time to send a \"novice\" to Downing Street.</p> <p>Brown's remark, which was also aimed at David Miliband, hit home at one nagging weakness at the top of the Tory party. This is that the Tories' candidate for prime minister - Cameron - is still only 41, while the candidate for chancellor - George Osborne - is only 37.</p> <p>\"David and George are acutely aware of what people say about their age,\" one senior figure said. \"That is why our conference will be grown-up stuff. There will be no schoolyard games.\"</p> <p>The challenge facing Cameron and Osborne was illustrated in an opinion poll which showed that they trail Brown and Alistair Darling over who is best placed to run the economy. The ComRes poll for BBC2's Daily Politics found that 36% of those polled trusted Brown and Darling to run the economy, while 30% trusted Cameron and Osborne.</p> <p>Senior Tories said they were unsurprised by the poll and are wary of other opinion polls giving the party a strong lead over Labour. One source said: \"We have not sealed the deal with the electorate. That does not happen overnight and will not happen immediately after this conference. But we will set to work to show what a difference we would make in government.\"</p> <p>The leadership says it is tweaking the conference programme but not embarking on big changes because Cameron's fundamental approach has, sources say, been vindicated by the recent turmoil on the financial markets. The Tory leader's message boils down to two main points: that Brown has mishandled the public finances and the Tories have been right to set out a fresh agenda which will rely less on a centralising state.</p> <p>Senior Tory sources say the leadership's main challenge is to show that a Tory government would really change the way Britain is governed. The Conservatives will do this by outlining their plans in three priority areas: the economy, the NHS and social policy to fix \"broken Britain\" by improving schools, helping families and reforming welfare. </p> <p>\"The economic and financial crisis shows that it is time for change and not for more of the same,\" one source said. \"A key objective will be nailing the myth that Gordon Brown is economically competent. We will be saying, why should people go for the person who got us into this mess?\"</p> <p>The Tory leadership knows that it will not repeat the success of last year's conference when it scared Brown into abandoning an early election after making populist pledges on inheritance tax and stamp duty. The party will adopt a different approach this year, with Cameron attempting to show he is ready to lead the country in troubled times. A key moment, just as it was last year, will be the speech on Monday by Osborne. The shadow chancellor, who told the Guardian earlier this month that he would be placed in a financial \"straitjacket\", will say that:</p> <p>\u2022 Green taxes are more difficult in the current economic climate. </p> <p>\u2022 A Conservative government may not match Labour's spending plans in the next round after 2011.</p> <p>\u2022 A new fiscal framework will be introduced by a Tory government to ensure that the chancellor cannot be both the architect and judge over rules on spending and taxation.</p>",
  "<p>Another day, another big American bank goes under. Yesterday, it was <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/mergersNews/idUSN2519733720080926\">Washington Mutual</a>, with $307bn in (somewhat impaired) assets, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/26/business/26wamu.html\">described</a> as \"the biggest bank failure in history\". <br> But that wasn't the biggest story of the day. That of course was the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/26/business/26bailout.html\">collapse of the bail-out negotiations</a> in Washington DC. George Bush invited congressional leaders, along with John McCain and Barack Obama, to sit down and hopefully announce an agreement on a bail-out package. John McCain, who had flown in so he could be on hand to seal the deal, sat silent as GOP dissidents blew the whole thing up.<br> The bail-out package on the table yesterday was a significant improvement over those of the Treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, whose <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/business/21draftcnd.html\">original proposal</a> included no oversight, no controls and no new regulatory requirements for the banks lining up for the proposed $700bn in spending authority - roughly five per cent of annual US national output. That is more than the current budget for defence, or for Social Security benefits, or for Medicare and Medicaid combined.<br> The agreement that got shot down yesterday is a big advance over the blank cheque first proposed, starting with an equity stake for the government, as was arranged with AIG. You want our capital? Fine, we own you. This leads logically to the issue of executive pay. Americans are rightly aghast at the prospect of bailing out chief executives who have amassed fortunes while driving the financial system into crisis. Limiting executive pay is easily accomplished if the government takes an equity stake, as is now contemplated. The agreement as it stood yesterday would institute much more control over dispensing the $700bn, which was originally proposed to be left entirely to Paulson's discretion. These provisions made an admittedly distasteful bailout a little easier to swallow. This is the deal that unraveled before George Bush's eyes yesterday. The Republican conservatives didn't so much <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTRE48O9WP20080925\">offer a plan</a> as a set of talking points. They asserted that \"private capital can be drawn into the market by removing regulatory and tax barriers.\" All we have to do is relax the regulations and give the banks more tax breaks and losses from impaired assets will somehow turn back into gains. <br> Meanwhile, it was off again, on again for the McCain campaign. After declaring that he would <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/25/AR2008092504603.html\">skip tonight's debate</a> to stay in Washington to deal with the crisis, McCain finally relented and said he will be <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/26/AR2008092601944.html\">on stage tonight</a> for the first debate. <br> Since the beginning of last week, John McCain has declared that the economy's fundamentals are sound, said that as president he would fire SEC member Christopher Cox when he couldn't, repeated his assertion that markets don't need more regulatory oversight, agreed that the bailout requires more oversight, returned to the idea of diverting Social Security funds into private investment accounts, issued a joint statement on the bailout with Barack Obama, announced he was suspending campaigning until further notice and would skip the first debate, sat in a meeting in which the deal over the bailout fell apart, and today decided he would attend the debate after all. No wonder he's looking tired.</p>",
  "<p>In a post this morning, I promised more to come on the question of how this bailout debate exposes a fraying of the longstanding Main Street-Wall Street alliance inside the GOP. So here we go.</p> <p>Let me first explain what that is. \"Main Street\" means, in short, the right-wing populist aspects of the current GOP--guns, God and gays, abortion, rallying the decent common folk against the coastal elites, etc. \"Wall Street\" means, literally, Wall Street -- more specifically, the pro-corporatist policies that the party puts in place once voted into office by the people on Main Street: the tax cuts for the wealthy, the stern opposition to almost all regulation and oversight of the private sector, the denial of a human role in climate change (because to acknowledge would imply the need to do something about it, and that means regulations and oversight), a host of policies like that. </p> <p>Get the little people to vote you in. Give them a small tax cut and lots of symbolic stuff that has no actual price tage. Give the store to the big people. That's the Main Street-Wall Street alliance.</p> <p>This bailout proposal puts them at each other's throats far more directly than I can ever remember in my adult lifetime. The decent common folk (almost all white, it should be mentioned) are usually egged on by right-wing populist talk radio jockeys and by politicians to aim their ire at the brown illegals or the homosexuals or the Harvard pointy-heads. Now they're being egged on against the bankers. It's a modern first. And the stakes are fascinating, and high.</p> <p>The always sagacious Mark Schmitt has written <a href=\"http://prospect.org/cs/articles?article=is_the_republican_alliance_finally_breaking\">an interesting take on this</a> at the American Prospect Web site. Why is this happening right now? That is, why are House Republicans rebelling so forcefully? Ideological reasons of course, but ideology is also, it is always to be remembered, driven by structural facts. And the key structural fact, Schmitt writes, is that the House GOP members now almost wholly represent Main Street-style districts:</p> <blockquote> <p>The House Republicans now represent white Americans of modest means -- the very opposite of the \"investor class.\" (Most of the Republicans who represented affluent districts were wiped out in 2006.) They are the ones whose phones are ringing off the hook with opposition to the bailout, the ones already saddled with an unpopular president, an unpopular war, and an uninspiring presidential nominee.</p> <p>Republican strategist Ed Rollins gave the game away on CNN: \"At the end of the day, there's a lot of people thinking about how to rebuild this party, and do we want to rebuild it with John McCain, who's always kind of questionable on the basic facts of fiscal control, all the rest of it, immigration. And I think to a certain extent this 110, 115 members of this study group are saying, here's the time to draw the line in the sand.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>A point very much worth keeping in mind. Senators represents entire states. Some states are small and largely rural. But most individual senators cannot, and the Senate as a body cannot, see itself as the representative of a purely conservative-populist-agrarian politics. America isn't Wyoming. And the affluent districts Schmidt refers to are, as Ruy Teixeira and John Judis (second mention today on Tomasky blog!) <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Emerging-Democratic-Majority-John-Judis/dp/0743254783\">anticipated years ago</a>, shading purple or even blue. So House Republicans are very logically representing the interests of the people, in some ways the <em>only</em> people, who vote for them.</p> <p>Problem: They aren't 51% of the country. Not even close. That's why the GOP needs the Wall Street end of the deal to hold up. But if the House GOP has its way -- and evidently, if John McCain has his way, since he's hitched his star to theirs -- the alliance may crumble. Back to Schmitt:</p> <blockquote> <p>he Republican coalition since at least Reagan has been a miraculous alliance of Wall Street and Main Street. Populist politics, such as the attack on \"elites\" now embodied by the enthusiasm for Gov. Sarah Palin, were the vehicle for Wall Street policies, the very policies that led to the crash. The alliance always seemed unsustainable. At some point it had to break -- you can't go on forever with policies that do nothing for your core constituencies. And now, in the backlash against the bailout, it has broken. The House Republicans see in that backlash an opportunity to, as Rollins says, \"rebuild this party\" on populist, anti-Wall Street grounds.</p> <p>There are only two problems with this tactic. First, the middle of a financial crisis that's about to turn into an economic crisis is a hell of a time to suddenly start listening to your constituents. But that's the problem with playing with populism -- eventually you have to deliver something, and it's likely to be something ugly.</p> <p>The second problem is that the Republicans still have nothing but reflexive Wall Street policies in their bag of tricks. The House Republicans' main alternative? Suspend the capital-gains tax for two years, to encourage banks to unload assets. Brilliant! Except that if these assets had produced capital gains, banks wouldn't be in trouble. But it would still be a nice giveaway for the top one percent. </p> </blockquote> <p>Well said.</p> <p>Final note: Schmitt mentions the great budget battle of 1990 as a spiritual antecedent to what's happening now (see a timeline of that <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6DC1439F93AA35753C1A966958260\">here</a>).<br>That year's budget deal, in which George H.W. Bush agreed with the Democrats to raise taxes, gave much impetus to a then much smaller group of House conservatives, who used right-populist resentment at the deal, which was cut at Andrews Air Force base (to say those three words in conservative circles to this day makes some people spit on the floor), as a way to build their numbers and eventually take over the House of Representatives four years thence.</p> <p>Their leader, then, was Newt Gingrich. So I was interested to read <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/thecrypt/0908/Is_Newt_still_running_the_show.html?showall\">this</a> in the Politico just this morning:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>If you didn't know any better, you'd think [House Republicans] were taking marching orders from Speaker-in-Exile Newt Gingrich. For the past week or so, he's been urging Congressional Republicans and John McCain to reject the $700 billion bailout and label it the \"Bush-Obama\" plan -- tying the Democratic nominee to the most toxic Republican since, well, Gingrich himself.</p> <p>Opposing the plan would also open up a world of political possibilities for Republicans still tepid about backing Senator Maverick, he's argued.</p> <p>If the GOP blocks the bailout, \"I think you will see the emergence overnight of a 'McCain Reform Wing of the Republican Party' and you'll see House and Senate members siding with McCain by overwhelming margins and then you'll be in a very different political environment,\" he told ABC a few days ago.</p> </blockquote> <p>A few days ago? It seems pretty clear that Gingrich was sketching out to ABC his desired scenario and then whispering in some ears up on Capitol Hill. Nothing wrong with that. Just interesting that a man who left politics in disgrace and drove his political bus over a cliff on the matter of the Clinton impeachment -- and who probably today has an approval rating of no higher than 32% or so -- still carries such weight.</p> <p>The circumstances were right in 1990 for such a nascent right-populist coalition to build. And Gingrich, rhetoric aside, just about always looked out for Wall Street. But whether he's right about that \"world of political possibilities\" today is another question. If the GOP holds onto Main Street and hands Wall Street to the Dems, how are they going to reach 51% (and where are they going to get their donations from?)</p> <p>Last point: If were Obama and David Axelrod, I'd be thinking about ways to tie McCain to Gingrich.</p>",
  "<p>As John McCain and Barack Obama decide how to approach the shifting debate over shoring up the US economy, they must contend with congressional colleagues who, technically, wield more power than either presidential candidate over the $700bn bailout. </p> <p>Who are these influential members of Congress? Do they all have to agree on a financial rescue before the deal can pass?</p> <p><strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong><br>Position: Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives<br>Age: 68<br>Represents: The San Francisco area<br>Why she's important: No other member of Congress got Henry Paulson to fall on bended knee this week. The US treasury secretary knows that Pelosi will have a harder time than Harry Reid, her Senate counterpart, winning sufficient support for the financial rescue. House Republicans are more restive than their Senate counterparts, and the House has a contingent of influential liberals who will battle to the bitter end to give the plan more foreclosure aid.</p> <p><strong>John Boehner</strong><br>Position: House Republican leader<br>Age: 58<br>Represents: The suburbs of Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio<br>Why he's important: The candid and canny Boehner has weathered a politically perilous year for his party, but the bailout poses his biggest test yet. If he spurns conservatives and joins forces with Pelosi and George Bush, Boehner could doom Republicans to an even longer exile from the halls of power. If he allies with conservatives and opposes the bailout as a betrayal of capitalism, Boehner could drive John McCain away from the plan - perhaps decisively swinging the election.</p> <p><strong>Chriss Dodd and Barney Frank</strong><br>Positions: Chairmen of the House financial services committee and the Senate banking committee <br>Ages: 64 and 68<br>Represents: Connecticut and the Boston suburbs<br>Why they're important: These two titans of financial policy are the Democratic point men on the bailout. Each has earned Obama's trust, and both are among the top recipients of campaign cash from now-defunct Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. There was some grumbling earlier this week among allies of the fiery Dodd that the acerbic Frank was too eager in pursuing a deal with the White House. </p> <p><strong>Richard Shelby</strong><br>Position: The banking committee's senior Republican<br>Age: 74<br>Represents: Alabama<br>Why he's important: The mild-mannered Shelby is such a free-market stalwart that his support for any form of the rescue plan is highly unlikely. It was his No 2 on the committee who joined Democrats for yesterday's ill-fated announcement that a deal was near. But Shelby remains the Republican best equipped to corral enough reluctant conservatives in the House to avoid a bailout meltdown. </p> <p><strong>Eric Cantor</strong> <br>Position: No 4 leader of House Republicans <br>Age: 45<br>Represents: Richmond, Virginia<br>Why he's important: Affable and attractive, this lone Jewish Republican in the House was one of the semi-finalists in McCain's search for a running mate. This week he has taken the lead of a \"task force\" tapped by Boehner to devise a conservative alternative to Paulson's bailout. The final product, which includes suspension of the capital-gains tax and government insurance for devalued mortgages, got poor reviews from Paulson - but it may well McCain.</p>",
  "<p>Tonight's debate is technically about foreign policy -- so John McCain had better hope he doesn't get any Ireland questions. The Ancient Order of Hibernians, one of the oldest US Irish Catholic groups, is none too pleased with the Republican nominee for telling a joke about the drunk \"O'Reilly twins\" during a public event in Pennsylvania this week. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exX_T19pKz8\">Here's the video</a>...</p> <p>The joke is a pretty old one -- although the name of the confused twins is often Murphy or O'Malley -- and McCain's sense of humor has gotten him <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/07/15/sources-recall-mccains-jo_n_112955.html\">into trouble before</a>.

In their famous phrase, it would pose a <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5ffd2606-69e8-11dc-a571-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1\">\"moral hazard\"</a> for ordinary Americans to think that their government would look after them if in old age their income or their health failed them.</p> <p>Those who have engineered these serial disasters, which have inflicted more damage on the US and world economy than Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida, have not been pursued into the hills of Bora Bora. Governments have reduced their taxes as they reward themselves with more and more salary, bonuses and stock options. If the shares of the company they manage take a dive, they backdate their options. If the company fails, they take a golden parachute. And when all else fails, they come to the taxpayers, top hat in hand.</p> <p>There is one small consolation. What if these guys had achieved their desire, shared with John McCain and George Bush, to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/25/johnmccain.economy\">privatise the social security system</a>? Just think of the social and economic disaster they could have wrought given all those trillions of dollars to play with.</p> <p>With the sudden affection for government ownership and assistance now globalising its way consensually from Washington, will we see a new, social-democratic age of government involvement in industry? Probably not soon. But as Churchill said, this surely deserves to be beginning of the end of the Washington neoliberal consensus that George Bush's father called <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/270292.stm\">voodoo economics</a>. Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and even Gordon Brown all succumbed to that old black magic \u2013 and looking at Barack Obama's economic advisers, there is a more than even chance that he, too, is under its spell.</p> <p>Clinton introduced tough love for working people, with welfare reform and lifetime caps, since it was clear that if you had no job it was your fault, not that of the titans of industry who had offshored your job or preferred to play the tables with sliced-and-diced derivatives of derivatives rather than use the capital for industrial and infrastructural investment.</p> <p>Clinton famously quibbled about what \"is\" meant. It is much more productive to consider what the \"market\" is, not least when it falls from McCain's lips. As the negative example of Soviet-style economy suggests, it is difficult to beat the market when you are talking about the free exercise of consumer choices for goods and services and the consequent allocation of capital for providing them. But in the US, no one blinks when governments ban or regulate sales of tobacco, alcohol or drugs, let alone gambling or sexual services.</p> <p>The financial markets, with increasing deregulation, have become a heady combination of sex and gambling. The Wall Street ideologues have been gambling our money and screwing us all, as investors, pensioners, workers and taxpayers.</p> <p>There has been some understandable chortling as the British and American governments override their free-trade platitudes to nationalise companies, whether Northern Rock or AIG, Fannie Mae or Freddy Mac. But the plan Goldman Sach's alumnus Hank Paulson is proposing now is not nationalisation. It is a strings-free handout to his former colleagues on Wall Street.</p> <p>However, there are opportunities in this crisis. Don't just take over the lemons left squeezed to the pips. Take equity shares in the whole companies. Maybe the proceeds could go to a sovereign wealth fund, to invest in manufacturing and infrastructure.</p> <p>Above all, if the high priests of finance invoke government assistance, then now is the time to finish the job that Roosevelt started, Truman propounded and even Nixon considered: a universal single-payer healthcare system in the US. If AIG, one of the world's biggest insurers, is effectively now nationalised by the US government without debate, then who can argue? Nationalise the health insurance companies.</p> <p>At the very least, now is the time to set up a comprehensive and effective regulatory system, and to ensure that if the taxpayers pick up the tab for executive excesses, the executives pick up more of the tab for taxes. Over to you Obama \u2013 and for that matter, Gordon Brown. Are you with the vile or the victims?</p>",

  "<p>A few choice details I wanted to be sure you don't miss. From <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/25/AR2008092504603.html?sid=ST2008092504642&amp;s_pos=\">a great tick-tock</a> in today's WashPost:</p> <blockquote> <p>Boehner and McCain discussed the bailout plan, but Republican leadership aides described the conversation as somewhat surreal. Neither man was familiar with the details of the proposal being pressed by House conservatives, and up to the moment they departed for the White House yesterday afternoon, neither had seen any description beyond news reports.</p> </blockquote> <p>Not enough for you? Try these morsels, from a strong news analysis in today's NYT:</p> <blockquote> <p>Senator John McCain had intended to ride back into Washington on Thursday as a leader who had put aside presidential politics to help broker a solution to the financial crisis. Instead he found himself in the midst of a remarkable partisan showdown, lacking a clear public message for how to bring it to an end.</p> <p>At the bipartisan White House meeting that Mr. McCain had called for a day earlier, he sat silently for more than 40 minutes, more observer than leader, and then offered only a vague sense of where he stood, said people in the meeting.</p> </blockquote> <p>And finally, here's <a href=\"http://www.time-blog.com/swampland/2008/09/what_actually_happened_yesterd_1.html\">Joe Klein's take</a> on things from Time's Swampland:<br></p> <blockquote> <p><br>So McCain \"suspends\" his campaign--he didn't, really--and equivocates about whether to debate because the financial emergency is so crucial--a week after he said the fundamentals of the economy were sound--and he flies to Washington where:</p> <p>1. The House Republicans blow up a rare, and necessary, moment of true bipartisanship to make it look like McCain, who has no expertise in this area, has come to the rescue.</p> <p>2. McCain sits mute in the White House summit arranged for his benefit. He doesn't even ask Paulson what he thinks of the House Republican plan.</p> <p>3. He refuses to take a stand, one way or another, on the Republican plan.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is worth noting, of course, that true to the above accounts, McCain hasn't uttered five substantive sentences I've aware of about what he actually wants to see in the plan, or not in it. It's surreal. As Elvis the C said: beyond belief.<br></p>",
  "<p>Whether it will ever really get through to most American voters remains unclear, but the following is the truth of the matter, rendered by John Judis -- a liberal journalist yes, but a circumpect one who has been a McCain admirer in the past. Judis called <a href=\"http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2008/09/26/putting-country-last.aspx\">this post</a> \"Putting Country Last\":</p> <blockquote> <p>I know there are economists, some of whom I respect, that think this financial crisis will blow over, that it's a crisis in the financial superstructure that won't ultimately affect the country's industrial base...[But as] Paul Krugman--who has been writing about the mortgage mess for years--has argued, it is not worth taking the chance that this crisis will blow over.</p> <p>That's a long way of saying that it is simply unpatriotic--it's an insult to flag, country, and all the things that McCain claims to hold dear--for McCain to hold this financial crisis hostage to his political ambitions. McCain doesn't know a thing about finance and is no position to help work out an agreement. If we do suffer a serious bank run, or a run on the dollar, it can be laid directly at his feet. As I said to friends last night, if McCain had been president at this point, I would have wanted to impeach him. </p> <p>...Whether because of age or overreaching ambition, McCain has become the kind of man he earlier railed against. He has become the Bush of 2000 against whom he campaigned or the Senate and House Republicans whom he despised. His defeat is now imperative.</p> </blockquote> <p>Says it all.<br></p>",

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/\">Clinton Global Initiative</a> sets itself up with an impressive challenge: collecting the most wealthy and powerful world actors to tackle the world's most pressing problems. Among the four issues on this year's agenda is energy and the environment. But a visit to the Wednesday and Thursday morning plenary sessions exposed an underlying timidity in the seemingly bold rhetoric on climate change.<br> While many speakers urged major investments in renewable energy to replace fossil fuels, hardly anyone made even a token nod to reducing energy consumption through efficiency or, heaven forbid, some shared sacrifice.</p> <p>On Wednesday Al Gore lit up an otherwise stultifying panel discussion with his electrifying call for aggressive, immediate action to cut carbon emissions. He threw out fanciful ideas such as building solar panels in Darfur and linking them, via a new electrical grid under the Mediterranean, to the market in Europe. And he called for others to take action, from state attorneys general to young people, who, he said, should be resorting to <a href=\"http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2008/09/gore-coal-civil.html\">civil disobedience</a> to <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/gores-call-to-action/?scp=1&amp;sq=%22al%20gore%22&amp;st=cse\">protest the construction of new coal plants</a>. Fitting the American electrical grid for wind and solar power, said Gore, \"should be the number one infrastructure programme\" for whoever is president. A laudable goal, to be sure.<br> Left unsaid, however, which reveals the hole in Gore's argument, was how America's energy demands would be met without those new sources. What about constructing mass transit or denser, greener buildings to reduce energy demands in the first place? It's easy to call for more energy from renewable sources. What's difficult is calling on an audience, especially the jet-setting attendees at CGI, to reduce energy consumption.</p> <p>Gore was no exception in this regard. On Thursday, <a href=\"http://gristmill.grist.org/print/2008/9/25/64519/8576?show_comments=no\">John McCain kicked off the plenary</a> with a speech that included a section on climate change and energy independence. But like Gore he did not approach the question of demand. In fact, he implied that such a thing is impossible, saying: \"Every form of economic activity requires the use of energy.\" Instead he called for the same palette of renewable energy programmes and \"sources yet to be invented\".</p> <p>During the panel, moderator Tom Brokaw repeatedly prodded two of the participants - Shimon Peres, the former Israeli prime minister, and Helle Thorning-Schmidt, leader of the Social Democrats in Denmark - to address the issue of America's extraordinary hunger for energy. But both responded primarily with the same bromides about finding new ways to sate the American public. \"Americans have a great capacity for innovation,\" noted Peres.<br> Gavin Newsom, the mayor of San Francisco, spoke of the need for society to \"take risks and invest in new technologies.\" But for a politician such as Newsom, that is the politically risk-free thing to call for. Saying that Americans should live in smaller homes or drive less would be the true risk.</p> <p>All but one of the half-dozen plenary participants who spoke about climate change avoided uttering the word \"demand\" with regard to energy. Barack Obama was the exception, and even he said only in passing that he would seek to reduce demand, without any specifics about how much or how to do so.<br> To be sure, many speakers called for a carbon tax or cap and trade system that, they hope, will force consumers to reduce consumption by increasing the cost. But at an event devoted to asking its attendees to make financial contributions to solving world problems it was remarkable to see that no one would forthrightly call for them to make sacrifices to address what most of the same speakers would say is the world's greatest problem of all.</p>",
  "<p>The US presidential debate is going forward as planned tonight, with John McCain reversing his original plan to skip the event if a financial bailout deal is not reached between Congress and the White House.</p> <p>\"Senator McCain \u2026 is optimistic that there has been significant progress toward a bipartisan agreement now that there is a framework for all parties to be represented in negotiations,\" the campaign said in a statement.</p> <p>\"Following the debate, he will return to Washington to ensure that all voices and interests are represented in the final agreement, especially those of taxpayers and homeowners.\"</p> <p>McCain had declared that the debate should be delayed pending a firm agreement on giving the US treasury secretary authority to buy up toxic mortgages from struggling financial firms.</p> <p>But despite the Republican's assertion of progress, the $700bn rescue plan remained in limbo today. Democratic leaders vowed to renew their negotiating efforts, while still chiding McCain for his intervention in the bail-out talks yesterday.</p> <p>\"The time is now for House Republicans to come to the negotiating table and for presidential politics to leave the negotiating table,\" Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate leader, told reporters today. </p> <p>\"The insertion of presidential politics has not been helpful. It has been harmful.\"</p> <p>Members of Congress are meeting behind closed doors today with an eye to crafting a financial pact that can attract votes from enough Democrats and Republicans to pass. </p> <p>But McCain's appearance yesterday at the White House - where he reportedly gave a nod to an alternative, tax-cutting plan devised by conservatives in the House of Representatives - continues to roil the process.</p> <p>Jeb Hensarling, the conservative Texas congressman who is helping to lead free-market critics of the deal, accused Democrats of making his party into scapegoats: \"It is ludicrous to think that House Republicans are 'holding up' any sort of deal, as Democrats falsely claim.\" </p> <p>The lack of resolution on the bail-out was all the more startling because McCain and George Bush had billed the White House meeting as an opportunity for the two presidential candidates to abandon their partisan roles and come together for the good of the nation.</p> <p>Instead, according to rapidly spreading accounts of the meeting, McCain refrained from taking a position on the $700bn rescue backed by Bush. Henry Paulson, the treasury secretary, was reduced to bending on one knee and pleading with the Democratic House speaker - who is Catholic - not to \"blow up\" the plan.</p> <p>Chris Dodd, the Democratic chief of the Senate banking committee and a lead negotiator on the bail-out compromise, assured reporters that McCain's resistance was not shared by all in his party.</p> <p>\"There are Republicans, serious Republicans, who care about this, and I'm grateful for them,\" Dodd said.</p> <p>But it is unclear how many of those Republicans can be persuaded to join Bush and senior Democrats in supporting a hugely expensive proposal that most economists have panned and many voters decry as a handout to Wall Street rather than ordinary taxpayers.</p> <p>The alternative bail-out that McCain raised during the White House meeting has an extremely slim chance of passing. Still, Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she is open to considering it as part of a broader rescue deal.</p> <p>While Congress picked up the pieces of what many believed was a workable agreement just 24 hours ago, Wall Street signalled that time may be running out. </p> <p>The US government was forced to seize and sell off Washington Mutual last night in a quick cleanup of the largest bank failure in American history, and shares in both London and New York markets opened more than 100 points down.</p>",
  "<p>After my article last week criticising <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/16/libdemconference.liberaldemocrats2\">Lembit Opik</a>, I feel the need to issue a clarification. I have to announce that I will be voting for Lembit. Well, I'll be giving him my <a href=\"http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/article.php?id=55\">second preference</a>, with <a href=\"http://www.im4ros.com/home.jsp\">Ros Scott</a> getting my first. The director of <a href=\"http://www.liberal-vision.org/index.htm\">Liberal Vision</a> Chandila Fernando has also announced his intention to stand, a nakedly cunning stunt to add to his stunt pamphlet (<a href=\"http://www.liberal-vision.org/store/Liberal%20Vision%20-%20The%20Cameron%20Effect.pdf\">pdf</a>) and stunt purity list (<a href=\"http://www.liberal-vision.org/store/Liberal%20Vision%20-%20How%20liberal%20are%20the%20Liberal%20Democrats.pdf\">pdf</a>) (which endorsed Lembit) last week. As an exercise in self-promotion, it is hard to fault Fernando's tactics \u2013 his thinktank has gone from nowhere to top of the internal party debate in the space of a fortnight \u2013 but it would be nice if the spin were to start being matched by substance at some point.</p> <p>Back to Lembit. He has resigned his front bench position to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/24/lembitopik.liberaldemocrats\">spend more time on his campaign</a>. One can only ask what took him so long and whether he merely jumped before he got pushed.</p> <p>His campaign is already on its <a href=\"http://www.lembit4president.co.uk/\">second website</a>, the first of which has wisely now been consigned to memory, and he has made a new <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=p3Q0HjH9Wns&amp;feature=related\">YouTube video</a> (the aggressive, in-your-face style of which is distinctly redolent of the Verve's <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx3m4e45bTo\">Bittersweet Symphony promo</a>). But problems with the campaign remain. Despite Lembit's claim in his manifesto to be capable of projecting \"clear messages,\" it is mired in a mishmash of slogans: \"Lembit4President\", \"I Pick Opik\", \"A President of Primary Colours.\" There is a sense of throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.</p> <p>The latter slogan is particularly curious. Jack Stanton, the presidential candidate in the novel <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Colors\">Primary Colors</a>, to which this is surely an allusion, is a silver-haired philanderer \u2013 a man with a keen intellect and charm whose personal failings come back to undermine his campaign time and again. At first inspired, the narrator becomes increasingly disillusioned with his candidate as he slides towards victory and there are hints he will end up squandering his time in office. Is that really the image Lembit wants to convey?</p> <p>Lembit is selling himself on his track record, so it is his track record we should turn to in this debate. I have four key questions for him which he needs to answer before the end of the election:</p> <p>a) Since Lembit claims to have such great campaigning and communications skills, why have the Liberal Democrats in Wales stagnated in the last two assembly elections (sticking with six AMs in 1999, 2003 and 2007)?</p> <p>b) Given the deep problems at the heart of the Kennedy leadership, wasn't it an error of judgment to stand by him? Loyalty is easy \u2013 a nodding dog at the back of a car can do it. Don't the \"rebels\" \u2013 including Nick Clegg and Vince Cable \u2013 deserve credit for taking a difficult decision that Lembit lacked the resolve to take?</p> <p>c) Why didn't Lembit stand against Simon Hughes in 2006? Hughes presided over a string of failures, most notoriously watching the party's membership fall by 10,000 members despite having pledged to treble the membership in two years. Again, doesn't that suggest a lack of resolve?</p> <p>d) Why wasn't Lembit's campaign ready in Bournemouth? Frankly, it was a total mess. Ros Scott launched her campaign exactly 12 months before, so it isn't as if Lembit didn't know she was serious. Is this the level of professionalism we can expect from him? Don't actions speak louder than words?</p> <p>These questions, for the Lib Dems at least, are important. The party president is not a figurehead but an executive role. I happen to think that the more focused Lembit who ran a highly organised campaign four years ago would have done a much better job than Simon Hughes. But now? He says he wants the role but all his actions suggest that his campaign is little more than an afterthought. Whether that is complacency or apathy, it is the last thing the party needs right now.</p>",

  "<p>Late start this morning owing to a) a segment I had to tape for Sir David Frost's al Jazeera show and b) a print piece that I have to file for tomorrow's print paper. Frost was great. Not that it matters to him, but he is now officially the only person who's ever interviewed me on TV who has also interviewed Richard Nixon and the Beatles.</p> <p>But before I sit down to write the print piece, I wanted to flag this one comment made by a \"GOP lawmaker\" in <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13946.html\">a Politico story</a> on the bailout talks:</p> <blockquote> <p>According to one GOP lawmaker, some House Republicans are saying privately that they'd rather \"let the markets crash\" than sign on to a massive bailout.</p> <p>\"For the sake of the altar of the free market system, do you accept a Great Depression?\" the member asked.</p> </blockquote> <p>Let the markets crash. These are the folks with whom John McCain is now allying himself. And beyond the immediate concerns of this campaign, the remark suggests a Main Street-Wall Street schism in the GOP that's been brewing for a long time and that is absolutely central to what's going on right now on Capitol Hill. More on this later today.<br></p>",

  "<p>Shia LaBeouf. All the vowels. All the studios eating out of his hand. Except it's Paramount that seems to have the tightest grip on the youngster these days. LaBeouf may have been bored and boring in Indiana Jones And The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but the fast rising former Disney Channel child star is already proving to be a solid box office bet even though his grown-up career is still in its infancy. After the recent triumphs of Indy 4, Transformers and Disturbia \u2013 the one that launched him into the big time 18 months ago \u2013 LaBeouf returns this weekend with Eagle Eye and the only real question is which film will rank second.</p> <p>The timing couldn't be better to open a conspiracy thriller. It's been months since a film has worn its dark heart on its sleeve \u2013 remember that Warner Bros vigilante flick about the chap in the suit with the pointy ears? \u2013 and the climate of anger, allegations and accusations sparked by the US economic collapse will serve Eagle Eye well. The reviews have been mostly unkind but this isn't the type of release that needs support from the critics: a number one launch seems assured and Box Office Guru predicts it will gross in the region of $27m in its first three days.</p> <p>Eagle Eye will have a fight on its hands to stay top next weekend, when Disney unleashes Beverly Hills Chihuahua and MGM shows us How to Lose Friends and Alienate People, but no doubt LaBeouf will take that on his whiskery chin. The kid's been acting most of his life and is an old pro: in fact IMDb even has him down on the voice cast of Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, which deserves mention because that film came out in 1984, two years before LaBeouf was born. Talk about a child prodigy. (Upon closer inspection it transpires that LaBeouf featured in the voice cast of the 2004 English-language version, but it's much more fun to disregard this when discussing the LaBeouf oeuvre at parties.)</p> <p>For the older crowd prone to weeping, Warner Bros releases Nights in Rodanthe, a romance that reunites Richard Gere and Diane Lane for the third time in their careers after the 2002 summer hit Unfaithful and The Cotton Club from 1984, which also \u2013 and this isn't widely known \u2013 stars LaBeouf as a baby-faced crime lord whose nanny whips him into fits of homicidal rage by burping him in front of his victims. Rodanthe has several things going for it: the film is based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks, who wrote the book that inspired the 2004 hit romance The Notebook, and stars two classy leads. The distinct lack of an adult romance in the charts should help too and a $10-12m debut would appear to be in order.</p> <p>And what of the other new releases? Spike Lee's second world war drama Miracle at St Anna launches through Disney and Guardian readers will know only too well what this one's about in the wake of Lee's recent spat with Clint Eastwood. It's almost three hours long and doesn't have a big cast so the $6m estimates that I've heard around town seem generous. Both this film and Nights in Rodanthe, being by nature more mature works, could lose sizeable chunks of their audience on Friday night if John McCain gets back from his eleventh hour mission to \"fix the economy\" in time to glower across a stage at Barack Obama in the first Presidential debate.</p> <p>The first rule of Iraq War films these days is you don't talk about Iraq War films. The conflict became the kiss of death in Hollywood last year when a slew of war-related stories like In the Valley of Elah, Redacted, The Kingdom and Rendition all flopped. So it's not hard to see why Roadside Attraction and Lionsgate have kept the marketing campaign for The Lucky Ones low-key; so low-key, in fact, that the key is out of sight. However the message is perfectly clear: this is not a film about the Iraq War and is instead your common or garden road movie. This film starrring Rachel McAdams, Tim Robbins and Michael Pena as Iraq War veterans on leave from the Iraq War who drive across the US while struggling to overcome the traumas experienced in the Iraq War is not a film about the Iraq War. Got it? Either way, The Lucky Ones is sweet enough but unremarkable and will struggle to break into the top ten.</p> <p>And finally, film-going will dip for a couple of days in the major cities next week during the Rosh Hashanah Jewish holiday. It always does, but nobody told the DreamWorks assistant below. Thanks to Nikki Finke on Deadline Hollywood for posting this gem.

  "<p>David Cameron today said that the Conservatives would use their conference next week to show how different they were from the \"divided\" Labour party that was obsessed with its own divisions.</p> <p>In a video message to his party released on its <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/26/digitalmedia.media\">redesigned website today,</a> the Conservative leader said there would be a \"big contrast\" between his conference in Birmingham and the Labour one in Manchester.</p> <p>Cameron also confirmed that that Tories have changed their conference schedule because of the seriousness of the crisis affecting the world economy.</p> <p>In an interview being broadcast on Sky tonight, Cameron accuses Gordon Brown of making comments about Conservative party policy that were totally untrue. He said this was \"completely unacceptable behaviour\" for a prime minister.</p> <p>In his video message Cameron said: \"There's going to be a big contrast between last week, where the Labour party was talking about themselves, how do they get out of the mess they're in, talking about their leadership and talking about their divisions, and our conference, which is going to be about what we want to do to help our country.\"</p> <p>Cameron said the conference would take place at a time of \"incredible financial turmoil\". The party had planned to open the conference on Sunday with a session celebrating its recent election successes, but instead there will be a discussion about the global economy.</p> <p>The Conservative leader said the theme for the conference would be \"Plan for Change\". The same slogan has been used by Barack Obama, the US Democratic candidate for president, in recent weeks.</p> <p>The conference is an important one for the Tories because it will be the first since 1997 when shadow ministers will be discussing policies knowing that they have a good chance of implementing them in office.</p> <p>But Cameron wants to avoid a tone of complacency.</p> <p>In an article written for the House Magazine, Cameron said: \"The phrase 'Go back to your constituencies and prepare for government' won't be used. We are not arrogant enough to be complacent. This is about making sensible preparations for the possibility that we will soon be in a position to implement our policies in government.\"</p> <p>In the wide-ranging Sky interview, Cameron said that Brown's \"experience\" showed why he should not remain prime minister, revealed that Afghanistan would be his foreign policy priority and defended his decision to be photographed with his children.</p> <p>Alan Duncan, the shadow business secretary, told the Financial Times today the mood of conference would be \"sober, responsible, determined\".</p> <p>He told the FT: \"Being in government is going to be fraught with difficulty because we're going to be there picking up the mess and it's difficult to be popular when you're picking up the mess.\"</p>",
  "<p>Limiting the pay of fat cat bosses is a familiar theme of union and religious leaders. But what's this \u2013 the Republican president of the US and his treasury secretary want to curb the excessive pay-offs and bonuses of Wall Street's finest? Surely it's a seismic shift in thinking at the White House?</p> <p>Any rescue plan \"should make certain that failed executives do not receive a windfall from your tax dollars\", Bush told Americans. And Paulson said US citizens were right to be angry about executive compensation. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/business/economy/25bush.html\">\"No one understands pay for failure,\"</a> he said.</p> <p>Perhaps Bush has been driven by fear of the dire consequences if the $700bn bank bail-out measures do not go through. The Washington Post says that during yesterday's crisis meeting on Capitol Hill, Bush is said to have warned of the economy: <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/25/AR2008092500268.html\">\"If money isn't loosened up, this sucker could go down.\"</a></p> <p>Barack Obama and John McCain have put executive pay at the top of their lists of conditions for any agreement. McCain said: \"The senior executives of any firm bailed out by treasury should not be making more than the highest-paid government official.\" </p> <p>That would cap pay at the level of the US president, namely $400,000, says the Independent, although <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/pay-curbs-plan-for-bankers-942940.html\">it doubts whether Congress will heed McCain's call</a> to the letter.</p> <p>In the Labour-supporting Mirror, Vince Cable, the Lib Dem treasury spokesman, explains why the plan to spend $700bn of US taxpayers' money on <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2008/09/26/poison-seeping-into-banks-115875-20753531/\">\"buying back dodgy mortgages from banks\"</a> is a thoroughly bad idea.</p> <p>Cable, a former chief economist with Shell, says the UK should not copy the US scheme: \"Nobody can give a good reason why it's fair that bankers who got rich by taking irresponsible gambles should be rescued by the taxpayer as soon as their luck runs out.\"</p> <p>The Economist says the bail-out should go through, but it rails against the <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12304785\">\"rotten idea\"</a> of salary caps on bank executives. It concedes that it's a struggle to keep a straight face when you read the words \"talent\" and \"Wall Street\" in the same sentence, but argues that \"there is no surer way of driving finance offshore or into hedge funds where it is beyond the gaze of regulators\".</p> <p>Salary caps are on the UK agenda. But the FT quotes an official from the Financial Services Authority as saying that the regulator is wary of doing anything that might harm the City's ability to remain competitive. <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/76142446-8b50-11dd-b634-0000779fd18c.html\">\"We'd be\u2026 very hesitant to impose a tougher framework</a> if we didn't know if it would be carried forward globally. Otherwise we run the risk of moving everybody offshore,\" the official told the paper. </p> <p>The issue is a divisive one. On the Moneyweb blog, views range from wholehearted, if harsh, support for pay caps - <a href=\"http://www.moneyweb.co.za/mw/view/mw/en/page149519?oid=227416&amp;sn=Detail\">\"cap their salaries and their kneecaps\"</a> - to anger at official meddling. \"When these hugely greedy execs come crying cap in hand to the US taxpayer, they should get very little,\" says the same blogger who suggested kneecapping. But another counters: \"If I start a business there is no way government is going to tell me how much I may earn in salary and stocks.\"</p> <p>What do you think? Should the top bankers, whether in the US or UK, be punished by having their pay capped?</p> <p><em>This is an edited extract from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/wrap\">the Wrap</a>, theguardian.com's round-up of the day's papers.</em></p>",
  "<h2>A matter of debate</h2> <p>It was a day of high drama in Washington as some of the biggest policy questions imaginable collided head-on with short-term political tactics. John McCain and Barack Obama headed to Washington to meet George Bush after McCain announced the suspension of his campaign. The Republican presidential nominee said he wouldn't attend tonight's foreign policy debate in Mississippi if a bailout deal couldn't be struck \u2014 though his ads continued to air, and last night he managed to give three television interviews.</p> <p>But McCain also wanted a deal for which he could claim credit, while Democrats didn't want to endorse a Bush plan without Republican support. That would allow McCain to present himself as standing up for Main Street against the establishment forces of Wall Street.</p> <p>By mid-afternoon, lawmakers in Congress were signalling that a deal had been agreed in principle, including limits on executive pay and a way for taxpayers to benefit from the success of rescued firms by means of an equity stake. But last night, after a subsequent meeting at the White House, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/26/uselections2008.johnmccain\">that deal was back in the air</a>. Conservative Republicans were reportedly in open rebellion at the scale of the proposed $700bn bailout, while Democrats complained of being blindsided by a new, more conservative proposal - apparently floated by John McCain, who has spent much of his political career espousing principles directly opposed to those underlying the bailout. \"What this looked like to me,\" said the Democratic chairman of the Senate banking committee, Christopher Dodd, looking irritated, \"was a rescue plan for John McCain.\"</p> <p>Nobody seemed to take seriously the notion that McCain might not find a way to be present in Mississippi, but it was still far from clear how he'd manage to do it. Obama stayed overnight in Washington instead of returning to Florida for more debate preparation, but he has vowed to attend the Mississippi event whatever happens - even if it means turning it into a town hall meeting or an interview. The way things are going, it would be wise to expect the unexpected today.</p> <h2>What to watch out for</h2> <p>Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that the debate goes ahead (in one instant poll reported yesterday, 86% of Americans said they wanted it to). Almost 20% of the electorate are still undecided, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/26/uselections2008.barackobama\">writes Ewen MacAskill in today's Guardian</a>, and both Democratic and Republican pollsters agree that the debate, set to attract a record television audience, could settle doubts about the two candidates. Foreign policy and security, the advertised topic of the event, is McCain's strong suit. Obama's challenge will be to successfully address the question of whether, given his lack of experience, he'd make a credible commander-in-chief. Neither candidate is seen as excelling in the debate context; Obama can seem like a lecturer, while McCain can look wooden or tetchy.</p> <p>I'll be liveblogging whatever tonight's event turns out to be at <a href=\"blogs.theguardian.com/burkeman\">blogs.theguardian.com/burkeman</a> from 9pm eastern time (2am UK time).</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>While polls put Obama far ahead of McCain on the economy, the Republican still holds a firm lead over his rival on national security, the subject of tonight's debate. He's seen as more knowledgeable about world affairs by a margin of 23 points, according to a New York Times/CBS poll, and as the more effective commander-in-chief by a margin of 21 points. But only 38% think McCain is explaining what he'd do as president; 56% think Obama is doing so. Gallup's daily tracking poll has the candidates level pegging: 46%-46%.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/sep/26/uselections2008.useconomy>\" tomasky talk: house republicans stall bail-out plan< a><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> </a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/25/uselections2008.television\">Lindsay Johns: The quill versus the sledgehammer</a><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/sep/25/uselections2008.barackobama1\">Michael Tomasky video: The dos and don'ts of presidential debates</a><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/sep/25/uselections2008.sarahpalin1\">Campaign diary: Also, Alaska is on the same planet as Iraq and Afghanistan</a><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/sep/25/uselections2008.sarahpalin1\">Simon Tisdall: The maverick rides again</a><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/sep/25/uselections2008.barackobama\">Younge America: Presidential debates are just theatre</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/26/opinion/26krugman.html?hp\">New York Times: Paul Krugman - Where are the grown-ups?</a><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/26/john-mccain-to-the-rescue_n_129493.html\">Huffington Post: Video - John McCain to the rescue!</a><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/219841.php\">Talking Points Memo: Strange days</a><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/9/25/232644/542/412/610823\">Daily Kos: Obama tried to rescue meeting</a><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13910.html\">In a first, Palin takes press questions</a></p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"We have trade missions back and forth\" \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/sep/25/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">in a CBS interview with Katie Couric</a>, Sarah Palin fleshes out her involvement in high-level diplomacy between Alaska and Russia.</p> <p>\"I'll try to find ya some and I'll bring 'em to ya\" \u2014 in the same interview, in a segment broadcast earlier, Palin finally gives up trying to give examples of John McCain's past support for tough regulation of Wall Street.</p> <h2>Confession of the day</h2> <p>A crossword setter for the New York Times admits the truth: <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13888.html\">the paper is completely and utterly \"in the tank' for Obama\"</a> \u2014 at least as far as its crosswords are concerned.</p>",
  "<p>Good to see our old conspiracy-corner favourite, the \"October surprise\" scenario, re-surfacing in Jonathan Steele's report today that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/25/iran.israelandthepalestinians1\">Israel sounded out the White House</a> about a pre-emptive bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities and got the thumb's down.</p> <p>\"October surprise\"? As you probably know (but may not), it's a bit of American jargon to describe a covertly pre-arranged event designed by supporters of one or another candidate \u2013 or party \u2013 to impact on an imminent election and influence the result.</p> <p>For once today's story amounted to a thumbs down to the October surprise \u2013 a popular routine on the left, even I've floated it occasionally \u2013 because some of this year's speculation has focused precisely on that option: that Israel would trigger such a crisis just ahead of the November 4 presidential elections to help John McCain win the presidency.</p> <p>That's not so daft when you think about it. The Israelis are rightly scared of Tehran's mullahs and their traffic engineer-turned-fundamentalist president getting hold of nuclear weapons, almost as scary as Pakistan having nukes (that's a joke by the way). They once bombed Iraq's O'Chirac facilities and \u2013 so the polls tell us \u2013 are the ONLY country around the world which prefers McCain to Barack Obama.</p> <p>Come to think of it, I heard a version of this scenario when I was in Washington for a family wedding in July. A well-connected friend said it was doing the rounds: the Israelis had convinced themselves that President Obama would be bad for them.</p> <p>Actually a US president who yanked Israel's chain a bit \u2013 none has since Eisenhower \u2013 would probably do self-absorbed Tel Aviv more good than a Paul McCartney visit. But that's another story.</p> <p>Is there any historic substance to the \"October surprise\" fear? It started in the politically-polarised 60s when first Lyndon B Johnson \u2013 who stood down in 1968 over the Vietnam war \u2013 announced a halt to the controversial bombing of north Vietnam, to help his number two and would-be successor, Hubert Humphrey, beat Richard Nixon.</p> <p>It failed, but in 1972, when Watergate-paranoid Nixon faced a much weaker Democratic candidate, nice-but-hopeless George McGovern, he encouraged Henry Kissinger to talk up the \"peace in our time\" stuff. He won by 20 points \u2013 a near record margin \u2013 but went on to defeat himself.</p> <p>There have been other examples, though I don't think George W Bush's drink-driving arrest \u2013 revealed close to polling day in 2000 \u2013 quite counts in the big league. Nor do routine but clumsy attempts by al Qaida to issue an Osama bin Laden Christmas video a few weeks early.</p> <p>Wikipedia University cites North Korea's 2006 nuclear test and mentions the Lancet/Johns Hopkins study (2004) on the death toll in Iraq. Since co-author, Les Roberts, was standing for Congress on an anti-war ticket and said the timing was electoral he can hardly be accused of covert action, whatever outside experts said about his methodology.</p> <p>To my mind, the serious claim was made after the 1980 presidential elections in which Governor Ronald Reagan beat the sitting president, Jimmy Carter. It was said the Reagan team had done a secret deal with the Iranian regime of Ayatollah Khomeini to ensure that the US hostages \u2013 seized at the embassy a year earlier \u2013 would not be released before polling day, as Reagan feared they might. As I recall they were finally let go as Carter's plane took off on the final flight home to Georgia.</p> <p>At least three books said the claim was true and two Congressional inquiries concluded that it wasn't. That is a pretty inconclusive result. I'm not a conspiracy theorist \u2013 cock-ups drive history. But big conspiracies sometimes do exist.</p> <p>For instance, Bismark really did edit the telegram which prompted the airheaded Napoleon III to declare war on Prussia in 1870. Later the German general staff, who really ran the Second Reich, really were looking for an excuse (it turned out to be the murder at Sarajevo) to go to war in 1914 because modernisation was finally taking place in Russia.</p> <p>By 1917 Russia might be impossible to beat: do it now. Cynical and horrible, but they made a series of bad calls which eventually ruined them when they gambled they could win the war (not least by sinking American shipping) before the Americans and their money \u2013 they had solid banks at the time \u2013 arrived on the Western Front.</p> <p>Serves them right, though they ruined us all in the process. You may be thinking that history repeated itself in Iraq in 2002-3 and tipped the American Empire towards terminal decline. I support the cock-up theory there \u2013 sheer incompetence \u2013 but let's not go there today. It will be US bankers who do it for the US.</p> <p>Why might 1980 have been the real thing? Only because of what we do know. The Reagan government did have back channels to the ayatollahs. The president did later sanction the sale of badly-needed weapons, including TOW missiles to Tehran. It did channel the proceeds to the contra rebels in Nicaragua in express defiance of Congressional resolutions. It did all come out in the end.</p> <p>But no, in case you're wondering, I don't think the Bush administration arranged for the Pentagon and the Twin Towers to be attacked on 9/11, though I often read that many people around the world do. How sad for them.</p>",
  "<p>The disclosure (in today's Guardian) that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/25/iran.israelandthepalestinians1\">George Bush vetoed an Israeli plan</a> to attack Iran's nuclear sites earlier this year may turn out to be the best decision in his eight-year term. It is easy to deride this president and there is much to deride him for, but when he does the right thing it deserves to be applauded.</p> <p>He has had an abysmal record as commander-in-chief. His decision to launch an all-out attack on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> after 9/11 rather than using special forces and Pakistan's intelligence agencies in a hunt for Osama Bin Laden that would be limited to Tora Bora was the first blunder. The Taliban were no threat to the United States or the rest of the world, and there was no strategic need to overthrow them. In the event, the invasion of Afghanistan did not even achieve what should have been the primary goal of US policy, the capture of Osama and the undermining of al-Qaida. It was using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, without even hitting the nut.</p> <p>The invasion of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq\">Iraq</a> was Bush's second military blunder. It gave al-Qaida a new lease of life and a fresh platform for attacks on Americans, as well as damaging US prestige throughout the Middle East and much of the rest of the world. </p> <p>More recently, we have the US decision to start air strikes inside Pakistan against the will of the newly-elected civilian government, apparently in a desperate bid to try to kill Osama in the last weeks of Bush's term. Revenge, and the search for a scalp that can be trumpeted as an administration triumph, have overcome common sense. </p> <p>Finally, there is the foolish US policy of arming and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/05/georgia.nato\">supporting</a> Georgia's puffed-up president Mikheil Saakashvili, who turned a frozen border conflict into all-out war and provoked the first real danger of an east-west military confrontation in Europe since the end of the cold war. Even now when Saakashvili's recklessness has been exposed, Bush and his closest allies refuse to rebuke him.</p> <p>Against this background, Bush's sobriety on the use of force against Iran stands out as remarkable. It reflects the debates which were racking the Pentagon and White House this spring after the National Intelligence Estimate came out with the conclusion that Iran had stopped its nuclear weapons programme in 2003. The debate had its casualties, not least the <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/11/mideast/pent.php\">early retirement of Admiral William Fallon</a>, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and a known dove on the issue. But the ultimate winner was the intelligent pragmatism of the US defence secretary Robert Gates, who realised what the effects of an Israeli attack would be.</p> <p>Retired <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/id/160089\">General John Abizaid</a>, who was head of US Central Command until 2007, put it well in Newsweek recently. He doubted whether \"the Israelis have the capability to make a lasting impression on the Iranian nuclear programme with their military capabilities,\" and said an attack on Iran would be \"bad for the region, bad for the United States [and would] ultimately move the region into an even more unstable situation.\"</p> <p>Bush himself, according to today's Guardian report, warned Olmert with a similar message. He told them they would not be able to disable Iran's nuclear programme without launching a full-scale war, and provoking a reaction against American interests in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the US homeland itself.</p> <p>Thank you, George. The dying weeks of your presidency will indeed be marked by a triumph \u2013 on one condition. You must publicise your new strategy. Telling Olmert privately not to provoke a regional conflagration is a huge benefit, and no successor to Olmert is likely to take such dangerous action without prior US approval. But it would do even more good if you make your change of policy clear. Make a speech in which you announce unambiguously that the standard formula on Iran \u2013 \"All options remain on the table\" \u2013 no longer applies. Tell the world \"The military option is off the table\", except in the unlikely event that Iran itself starts an attack on Israel or the US. For the US or Israel to start a war because Iran may be trying to build a nuclear bomb, or even has succeeded in building one, cannot be justified.</p> <p>Regrettably, neither McCain nor Obama have been willing to take that position. They both stick to the \"all options\" formula. Bush can be innovative. He has already shown the wisdom and courage to veto Israel's plans for attack. It doesn't take much extra courage to go public and take credit for his veto.</p>",
