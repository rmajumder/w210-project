  "<p>Robert Mugabe will shortly install a new government in Zimbabwe following the collapse of political negotiations with his principal rival, Morgan Tsvangirai, according to the state-run press.</p> <p>But the leader of a breakaway opposition faction, Arthur Mutambara, denied claims by Mugabe's officials that he will join the administration, which Zimbabwe's president is portraying as a government of national unity in an attempt to win international backing.</p> <p>Senior ruling Zanu-PF party officials said on Tuesday that Mutambara had reached agreement with Mugabe on the shape of a new administration. South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, who was mediating the negotiations, confirmed that the two men did agree the division of powers in the next government, to be led by Mugabe.</p> <p>But Mutambara, who heads a splinter group from Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change, said that did not mean he is prepared to serve in a new administration while there is still no deal between the two principal players. The talks broke up after Tsvangirai refused to drop his demand that Mugabe relinquish power and become a ceremonial president.</p> <p>\"This is a tripartite negotiating framework. You cannot get an agreement where only two parties agree,\" said Mutambara. But he made clear his antipathy to Tsvangirai's insistence that Mugabe surrender power by calling on his MDC rival to \"put national interest before self-interest\".</p> <p>Tsvangirai's aides treated with suspicion Mutambara's claim not to have done a deal with Mugabe, noting that the opposition faction leader had shifted his position considerably in recent days and was praised by Zimbabwe's president in a speech earlier this week.</p> <p>But Mutambara was also under pressure from his own members of parliament yesterday, some of whom threatened to desert him if he did a unilateral deal with Mugabe. The Mutambara faction holds 10 seats in parliament, which represent the balance of power.</p> <p>One Mutambara faction MP, David Coltart, said that he would not back a unilateral deal with Mugabe. \"The political impasse will only be broken when we have an agreement that reflects the will of the people as expressed in the March election,\" he said.</p> <p>Despite the lack of progress during three days of talks on the central issue of who wields power, Mbeki insisted a deal was possible soon. \"We are indeed convinced that it is possible to conclude these negotiations quite quickly,\" he said yesterday. \"They are working on a truly inclusive government.\" </p> <p>Publicly, Tsvangirai said his party remains committed to dialogue but that the outcome must reflect the democratic will of the people established in the last generally accepted election result - the first round of presidential elections in March, won by Tsvangirai.</p>",
  "<p>John MacDougall, the Labour MP for Glenrothes, who has died aged 60 of mesothelioma, was a highly effective figure in the local government of Fife before going to Westminster in 2001. He led the well-regarded Labour administration on Fife council for nine years and was held in high esteem across the political spectrum.</p> <p>At Westminster, he was a loyalist in the Labour mainstream, which reflected his belief in party unity. In spite of a long illness, he continued to attend conscientiously to his constituency duties until the last weeks of his life. His last visit to the House of Commons, in circumstances of great pain, was in June to vote in support of the government over 42-day detention for terrorist suspects.</p> <p>MacDougall grew up in a Fife tradition of big politicians, at both local and national levels. Whenever the need arose - which it invariably did in response to every outbreak of local government reorganisation - he was at the forefront of campaigns to ensure that the kingdom of Fife remained a single, undivided entity. He enjoyed a close political and personal relationship with the prime minister Gordon Brown, who paid this tribute to him: </p> <p>\"In Fife, [John MacDougall] pioneered free travel for the elderly, led Scotland and Britain with nursery education for three and four-year-olds, was successful in pressing for new jobs and investment to replace thousands of jobs lost in mining and at Rosyth naval base, and was well known for his support of all local causes.\"</p> <p>The industrial disease that killed MacDougall is linked to contact with asbestos, and his doctors believed it probably derived from his early working days at the Royal naval dockyards in Rosyth. Born in Dunfermline, and educated at Templehall secondary school, Kirkcaldy, he served a boilermaker's apprenticeship before studying naval architecture at the Royal Dockyard College. He later obtained a diploma in industrial management. </p> <p>He then worked at the RGC oil rig construction yard in Methil, becoming shop stewards convener in 1978, a role in which he prided himself on never having led a strike: \"I could win more for the men through argument and negotiation.\" This was his style - not flamboyant but definitely respected for his cool head and commitment to social justice. </p> <p>After joining the Labour party in 1981, MacDougall became a councillor for Burntisland, the town in which he lived for most of his life, and for 19 years was always returned with huge majorities. He became the full-time leader of Fife regional council in 1987, serving until its abolition under local government reform. He was elected to the new Fife unitary council in 1995, becoming convenor when the council assumed its powers the following year. </p> <p>One of the local causes on which he devoted much energy was the demand for a second road bridge across the river Forth - now likely to be fulfilled; another was an attempt to build on Fife's coalfield tradition by making it a centre for energy innovation, both renewable and clean coal technology. He was also a member of the Scottish constitutional convention, which established the framework for the Scottish parliament.</p> <p>In 2001, Henry McLeish, the sitting MP for Fife Central, left Westminster for the Scottish parliament; MacDougall took his place, winning the Commons seat with a majority of 10,075. Following a boundary review, the seat became Glenrothes, which he took in the 2005 general election. He is survived by his wife Cathy, whom he married in 1968, and his children, Scott and Julie.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>John William MacDougall, politician, born December 8 1947; died August 13 2008</p>",
  "<p>Bone-crushing handshakes, along with endless speeches and travel, are among of the perils of being a presidential candidate's spouse, as Cindy McCain was reminded Wednesday.</p> <p>The wife of Republican contender John McCain made a trip to hospital for x-rays after shaking hands during an event at a golf club outside Detroit.</p> <p>\"We had a great luncheon fundraiser, and I shook hands with a very enthusiastic supporter and it got me the wrong way,\" Mrs McCain said after she reappeared on the campaign trail with her right arm in a sling.</p> <p>The McCain campaign said the handshake \"exacerbated an existing carpal tunnel condition\", and described the injury as a minor sprain.</p> <p>After her husband's 2000 campaign Cindy McCain said she had broken her wrist from repeated handshakes, which required pins.</p>",
  "<p>If the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/14/world/europe/14georgia.html\">shaky cease-fire</a> takes hold in Georgia, then the 21st century's version of the Six Day war may mercifully be coming to an end. That will come as a relief - especially for those caught up in the fighting, and for American and European leaders whose <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/08/20080809-2.html\">impotence</a> in stopping the Russian advance has been laid bare before the world.</p> <p>The unfortunate lesson of the Russo-Georgian war is that this is the first tangible example outside of the Middle East of how George Bush's catastrophic foreign policy has weakened the US and the West. The next American president has been dealt a terrible hand - but he must take immediate steps to prevent this situation from getting worse.</p> <p>The root causes of the West's alarming helplessness lie in the broad strategic failure of the Bush administration's foreign policy. It first alienated and then <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1392791.stm\">badly misread Putin's character and intentions</a>, only realising his true threat to Western interests after it was too late. The administration then invaded Iraq, splitting the Western alliance, undermining international institutions, and bogging down American troops in a long and bloody occupation that has eroded the West's deterrent force. Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib have weakened respect for international norms and further damaged <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/06/27/news/pew.php\">American global leadership</a>. Iran has been the major regional beneficiary of the US invasion, projecting power across the Middle East through its support of militants in Iraq, Lebanon, and the Palestinian territories. </p> <p>America's struggles, Iran's gains and Israel's fears together significantly increase Russia's leverage and influence. The US and Europe need Russian cooperation to curtail Iranian nuclear weapons development because Moscow can make or break economic sanctions and any long term solution is going to require Russian support.</p> <p>Beyond these strategic gifts from the US, Russia itself has gained strength and is no longer the weak and declining superpower that characterised much of the post-Soviet period. A booming economy built on soaring energy prices and a strong autocratic government have fed into Putin's efforts to restore the confidence and pride of the once-great Russian nation. This new Russia now seeks to reclaim its place on the world stage.</p> <p>In a feeble bid to push back, the Bush administration feted the democratically elected governments of Ukraine and Georgia as the antidote to the Kremlin's ambitions. Bush went to Tbilisi and <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/05/20050510-2.html\">promised the Georgians</a> that \"as you build a free and democratic Georgia, the American people will stand with you.\" Georgia even sent 2,000 troops to fight in Iraq. It was not unreasonable for the Georgians to think that America would back them. Of course Putin knew that it could not. </p> <p>John McCain has no understanding of just how weak America's position is in this crisis and his response has been to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/12/us/politics/12mccain.html\">escalate the confrontation</a> with Russia - putting America and the world on a dangerous course towards conflict should he become US president. Drawing <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/12/AR2008081202935.html\">obvious allusions</a> to Hitler's march into the Sudetenland, McCain said of Russia's rout of Georgian forces: \"we learned at great cost the price of allowing aggression against free nations to go unchecked.\" He compounds the irresponsible rhetoric of the Bush administration, yet he proposes nothing to address America's complete lack of leverage. </p> <p>Even though it is unlikely that Russia will again resort to force in the near future, it is guaranteed to press its advantage in countries like Ukraine and other former Soviet republics. If America and the West are to summon any meaningful response, we must stop issuing hollow threats and begin to address Russia's current points of leverage. </p> <p>The first step is to get serious about resolving the nuclear standoff with Iran. Putin's trump card is that the West is appropriately more concerned about an aggressive nuclear armed Iran than it is about Russia asserting control over its near abroad. Russia's clear power play has raised the stakes in reaching an acceptable settlement with Tehran and we simply cannot allow that process to drag on indefinitely while Russia presses its advantage and Israel grows more concerned. </p> <p>A great deal of Russia's economic power is based on rising energy prices and its massive reserves of natural gas. That is not likely to change in the short term, but it is possible to lower energy costs and lessen the strategic importance of fossil fuel reserves by transforming our economies to run on renewable energy sources. This would create a finite time horizon after which Russia's dominant energy position will be less significant. </p> <p>The energy boom has generated enormous wealth in Russia that has covered over numerous looming crises. Its public institutions are rife with corruption, its infrastructure is crumbling, its health system is a shambles, and it is facing a demographic time bomb of an aging population and a rapidly declining birth-rate. These are all areas in which the US and Europe can help improve the lives of the Russian people. Doing so would require a difficult shift in the orientation of aid programs away from a focus on democracy promotion, but it has the chance of reversing the reputation of the West within Russia and lessening the appetite for confrontation. </p> <p>These soft power moves must also be accompanied by the restoration of the credibility of American hard power by bringing the occupation of Iraq to a responsible conclusion. Only then can we reset our military forces and restore their deterrent capabilities. Russia does not want to get into a shooting war with the United States. It can act aggressively now because it knows that is not a realistic possibility. A credible deterrent of strong and united Western forces would surely help dissuade Putin from rash actions.</p> <p>Barack Obama has put forward a comprehensive foreign and security policy compatible with each of these steps: early and high-level negotiations with Iran; transitioning towards a green economy; emphasising human dignity and peoples' needs and aspirations in US aid programs; and ending the war in Iraq. John McCain proposes doing none of these things as he hurtles towards confrontation with both Russia and Iran, seemingly intent on turning this bad situation into a terrifying one.</p>",

  "<p>Excellent reporting in The New Republic by my old friend Sarah Blustain on John McCain's <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=3483eb20-9228-4700-9557-57a47a676e0b&amp;p=1\">real record on abortion rights</a>. Over the course of his career, McCain has cast 130 choice-related votes, and he's voted against the pro-choice position on 125 of those. </p> <p>Yet, naturally, this isn't really what most people who know anything about McCain and abortion know. What they know is that in 1999-2000, when he was running against the GOP establishment, he was making a bunch of mealy-mouthed noises about how Roe v. Wade should be preserved with all its imperfections, and so on. Blustain cites one poll in which 36% of the women supporting McCain identified themselves as strongly in support of Roe. Presumably most of them don't know McCain's real views.</p> <p>Another task for camp Obama, which has been slow to define McCain. But a great piece of reporting that's worth a read.</p>",

  "<p>George Bush today said the US military would start delivering humanitarian aid to Georgia amid reports that Russia has broken the terms of a ceasefire in the Caucasus conflict.</p> <p>Republican presidential candidate John McCain took a hard line on Russia during a news conference this afternoon, saying the US needs to review the country's aspiration for membership in the World Trade Organisation in light of the events of recent days. The senator also called into question whether Russia should host the 2014 winter Olympic Games at Sochi.</p> <p>Bush has dispatched Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, to Tbilisi \"to rally a free world in defence of a free Georgia\", as he put it. Rice will first meet with French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who helped orchestrate the ceasefire that Russia is accused of breaking.</p> <p>\"The US stands with the democratically elected government of Georgia and insists the territorial sovereignty of Georgia be respected,\" Bush said.</p> <p>\"We expect Russia to honour its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance.\"</p> <p>The US military's humanitarian mission to Georgia will include Pentagon aircraft and naval vessels, Bush said. It is unclear when the first shipment of aid can arrive in the embattled nation and whether Russian forces will perceive the assistance as a US intervention.</p> <p>Bush's promise of aid comes as Georgian president Mikhail Saakashvili expressed frustration with the pace of the American response to the Caucasus conflict. The US-educated Saakashvili has touted his closeness to western leaders, including Republican presidential nominee John McCain, and appeared dismayed at his allies' failure to intervene in the crisis.</p> <p>\"Yesterday I heard Senator McCain say, 'we are all Georgians now',\" Saakashvili told CNN today, referring to a speech in which the Republican candidate declared solidarity with Tbilisi.</p> <p>\"Well, very nice, you know, very cheering for us to hear that, but okay, it's time to pass from this. From words to deeds,\" the Georgian leader added.</p> <p>McCain has accused Democratic rival Barack Obama of mounting an insufficiently vocal defence of Georgia as Russian troops crossed into its independent territory this week. The Republican's closeness to Saakashvili has also drawn criticism: the senior foreign policy adviser to McCain was a paid lobbyist for Georgia until three months ago.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters at the White House, Bush criticised early reports that Moscow already has violated the terms of the French-brokered ceasefire, obstructing parts of the city of Gori and threatening Tbilisi. He sternly warned Russian fighters to refrain from harming Georgians who are caught in the crossfire.</p> <p>\"All forces, including Russian forces, have an obligation to protect innocent civilians,\" Bush said.</p> <p>The US is facing questions this week about whether its public engagement with Georgian president Mikhail Saakashvili gave the small nation misguided hope that America would defend them in case of hostilities with Russia.</p> <p>Rice made a high-profile visit to Tbilisi last month, as Saakashvili escalated a push to hold onto the breakaway province of South Ossetia.

  "<p>Fife and Westminster has lost a man who shared the values of people brought up in the Labour movement in central Scotland: a grafter in whatever job he took on, a deep concern for others and belief in social justice that had been drilled into him by his parents. </p> <p>Born in Dunfermline, John spent most of his life in Burntisland, moving only when he felt that he should be living in the constituency he represented as a member of parliament. </p> <p>Educated at Templehall secondary school in Kirkcaldy, John completed his apprenticeship as a boilermaker before studying naval architecture at the Royal Dockyard College. He later achieved a Diploma in Industrial Management, becoming a member of the Institute of Industrial Managers. He also became a director of Glenrothes Development Corporation and Fife Enterprise, gaining boardroom and business skills.</p> <p>John was an active trade unionist all his adult life. He worked at the RGC oil rig construction yard in Methil and in 1978 became a shop steward, soon after being elected Shop Stewards Convenor. </p> <p>He often referred to the fact that he never led a strike, stating, \"I never had to. I could win more for the men through argument and negotiation\". In his role as convenor he attended the Westminster parliament, little knowing that he would later become an MP. </p> <p>John entered local politics in 1981 as a result of the sudden death of the sitting councillor in Burntisland. His quick decision to accept the Labour nomination changed his life. John's local popularity, and a highly active Labour party branch, helped return a massive majority, something that he maintained throughout his 19 years as councillor for the Burntisland area. </p> <p>In his last few weeks, John talked about the first evening that we canvassed the voters of Burntisland back in 1981. I reminded him that I had expressed surprise at the canvass return from one street that showed over 90% support. He asked to see the sheet, smiled and said that I was not to worry about those people who had not been in, \"My mum knows them all: they'll all be Labour.\" And so it proved.</p> <p>Among the many projects in which he was involved, the opening of the Beacon leisure centre and swimming pool in Burntisland gave him the greatest satisfaction. The town's open-air pool, closed long before his election, stood as a symbol of municipal neglect. </p> <p>John used his considerable knowledge of European funding and of local government finance to secure an excellent facility for his adopted home town. His successful campaign for a local bus service in the Burntisland area also gave him great satisfaction. </p> <p>The sense of freedom that this benefit brought to so many people produced a determination in John to retain the free bus pass for the elderly. Fife was the first council in Scotland to introduce free travel for the elderly, and John brought his considerable skills into several tough negotiations when the service was under threat.</p> <p>John always felt a debt of gratitude to those councillors who took him under their wing, particularly the Labour leader in Fife at the time, Bert Gough, from whom he learned so much. He became the longest serving leader of Fife Regional Council, spending nearly nine years in post, and became leader of Fife Council in 1996. </p> <p>He also led the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities before leaving this post to fight to keep Fife as a single local authority. The importance of trade links with Europe became of increasing interest to John. His tireless work in this field led to him being honoured as vice-president of the Assembly of European Regions.</p> <p>While leader in Fife John promoted many initiatives, including the superfast ferry service from Rosyth and the park and ride facility to relieve the pressure on the Forth Road Bridge. He was one of the first councillors to begin to campaign for a second road crossing over the Forth. </p> <p>Ever the pragmatist, John argued that with increasing prosperity working people would not abandon their cars. Along with Gordon Brown, he was also at the forefront of the campaign to save Rosyth Dockyard. </p> <p>In parliament, John continued to advocate a strong relationship between local and central government, typified through his work with the Lee O'Brien Solvent Trust and DAPL (Drugs and Alcohol Leven) which work closely with Fife council. He also took a keen interest in the drugs debate at all European levels, particularly in Holland, where he learned a great deal on his visits.</p> <p>In his latter years, John's priorities centred on the issue of renewable energy. He had a vision that saw Fife emerge as a leader in clean coal technology, while developing renewables. </p> <p>John saw it as logical that following the golden age of coal and oil, Fife had a vital role to play in this field. On occasion John shared his frustration with friends and colleagues at what he saw as the confusion that devolution of renewable energy to Holyrood had caused in the provision of energy nationally. </p> <p>John's loyalty to the Labour party and its leadership was never in doubt. He firmly believed that \"washing your dirty linen in public\" was simply daft politics. Any reservations that he had about policy, people or presentation were never aired in public. </p> <p>In his final months, John made it down to Westminster to support the prime minister and the government in the vote on 42 days detention for terror suspects. </p> <p>Although in great pain and discomfort he made the journey by train in the company of his daughter Julie. Emotions ran high when he met Gordon Brown, as they did when Gordon visited him in final days at Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy.</p> <p>Even knowing that he was in his last few weeks of life John continued to work in his constituency. His last campaign was to try to persuade the Post Office that an upstairs branch in WH Smith in the Town Centre in Glenrothes did not meet the needs of many elderly and disabled constituents. By this time John was using a wheelchair to move around and fully understood the frustrations of those who had made representations to him.</p> <p>For a man who spent a great deal of his time defending and improving the conditions of others, he saw the irony in the news that he had developed a very serious asbestos-related lung disease, mesothelioma. This cruel disease has a gestation period of 30-40 years, and John's time working at Rosyth was identified as the likely source of his illness. </p> <p>Despite extensive treatment and surgery under a medical trial at Guy's hospital in London, the prospect of long-term health improvements did not materialise. John bore his illness with great bravery and dignity, expressing concern only at what he increasingly saw as a postcode lottery in health treatment throughout the NHS.</p> <p>Those who went to John for assistance met a man who would move heaven and earth to help them. To all who new John there will remain a memory of a genuine man who always had a kind word and a warm smile. Even in last few painful days his sense of humour was never far from the surface. </p> <p>About six months after John had undergone a course of chemotherapy we walked into the Sports and Social Bar in the House of Commons. This bar is frequented by MPs, Lords and many staff who work in the House. About 50 people were standing and sitting as we entered. I was astonished when everyone in the bar broke into applause. </p> <p>He was surrounded by well-wishers from all walks of life. I went to the bar to pay for our drinks and was politely informed by the barman, \"Put that away, these are on us for John.\" A finer compliment I could not imagine, and the episode neatly captured John's unique ability to connect with everyone he met. </p> <p>John's was a life well lived.</p> <p>His leisure interests included cycling, walking, sport and vintage cars. </p> <p>John is survived by his mother, his wife Cathy, his children Scott and Julie, and his sister Christine.<br> \u0095 Scott Brady is the parliamentary researcher for John MacDougall.

  "<p>The long-proposed <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i84d286596a535ecf5a3141fe4e1b2bee\"><strong>new Conan film</strong> has a new writing team</a> after Dirk Blackman and Howard McCain were hired to rework the script, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Producer Fredrik Malmberg says the writers have returned to the original stories written by Robert E Howard in the 1930s with the intention of creating a dark film in the vein of Christopher Nolan's reimagination of Batman. \"Fans expect [these types of movies] to be more true to the source material,\" Malmberg said. \"There's no reason there couldn't be a Conan movie every two years. He's almost like Batman: he's a dark hero. He's a hard hero. He has to be badass, but we also have to like him.\" The original 1982 Conan film was penned by Oliver Stone and director John Milius, with Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Cimmerian barbarian. A weaker sequel, Conan the Destroyer, followed two years later.</p> <p>Just over 20 years after playing Jesus in Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ, <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117990469.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1\"><strong>Willem Dafoe</strong> is to star in the Lars von Trier psychological thriller-cum-horror Antichrist</a>, according to Variety. Dafoe's character will not be the offspring of Beelzebub, however: Von Trier's script, which he wrote with fellow Dane Anders Thomas Jensen, centres on a couple who retreat to an isolated cabin in the woods following the death of their child. The shoot will begin this month in Germany, with Charlotte Gainsbourg starring opposite Dafoe.</p> <p><strong>Paris Hilton</strong> is being sued for allegedly reneging on a deal to promote a film she appeared in via TV shows, press and other public appearances. According to a suit filed earlier this week, Hilton was paid $1m to act and provide \"reasonable promotion and publicity\" for the 2006 comedy National Lampoon's Pledge This!, in which she played a beautiful sorority president who befriends a group of unconventional university freshers. The suit was filed on behalf of Worldwide Entertainment Group Inc, which financed the movie, by its receivers, the firm now being in liquidation. It asks for $75,000 in damages.</p>",
  "<p>At least 18 people were killed today in the north Lebanese city of Tripoli after a bomb exploded near a bus carrying civilians and soldiers, according to security officials. </p> <p>They said the bomb was planted on the side of a road and detonated at the busiest time of the morning as commuters headed to work.</p> <p>Nine soldiers were among the dead and at least another 45 people were wounded. TV footage showed a small bus wrecked by the blast in the centre of the north Lebanese city.</p> <p>Witnesses said fire engines and ambulances rushed to the scene, while soldiers and policemen cordoned off the area to investigate. </p> <p>No one claimed responsibility immediately after the attack. \"The army and security forces will not yield to attempts to terrorise them with attacks and crimes,\" said President Michel Suleiman, who had been army chief until his election in May. </p> <p>Tripoli is Lebanon's second largest city with a mostly Sunni Muslim population. It has witnessed sectarian clashes between Sunni fighters and followers of the Alawite sect, an off-shoot Shia sect, in the past few weeks, that has killed and wounded dozens of people.</p> <p>The city is also close to the Palestinian refugee camp of Nahr el-Bared, which experienced violent clashes last year between Lebanese troops and members of the al-Qaida-inspired Fatah Islam group. Hundreds were killed before the militants were defeated.</p> <p>Fatah Islam claimed responsibility for a bomb blast that killed a soldier in Abdeh, near Tripoli, on May 31. The latest violence comes at an especially sensitive time for Lebanon.</p> <p>Yesterday, after a five-day debate and weeks of negotiations that preceded it, the Lebanese parliament approved a national unity government that gave the Iranian-backed Hizbullah opposition a more powerful say in the running of the country, including veto power over major decisions.</p> <p>The explosion in Tripoli came as President Suleiman embarked on a landmark visit to neighbouring Syria \u2014 the first visit by a Lebanese president in about three years.</p>",

  "<p>Friday saw the start of the Olympics. And the end of the trial of Martin Dinnegan's killers. So it was timely that on Friday night I met with <a href=\" http://www.timesabc.org.uk/about-us.html\">Islington's Times Boxing Club</a> and Ben Kinsella's family, plus representatives of the local council and police. </p> <p>We were looking at how sport, specifically boxing, can help give young people a positive direction. Mark Prince, who <a href=\"http://www.kiyanprince.org\">lost his son, Kiyan</a>, told us how boxing had given his own life discipline.</p> <p>Now the club wants to do even more, by building another floor to their club to fit in more activities. Their volunteer leaders are passionate about the club and the way they give young people structure and ambition. </p> <p>I spent a decade working for the Sports Council and know how sport can transform young people's lives. The national lottery has brought big money into backing our Olympic contenders, and also for the grassroots. SportEngland pledged \u00a31.1bn for community sport through their community projects capital fund in 1999; but the latest figures show that \u00a3490m has still not been spent. It's so frustrating for clubs like Times who are doing great work but seem to be missing out on the money. </p> <p>Investing in sport fits well with the <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/news/liberal-democrats-outline-youth-crime-proposals.14915.html\">Lib Dem approach to tackling youth crime</a>; providing diversionary activities such as sport to stop young people getting sucked into crime, with restorative justice for those who do. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Labour government spends 11 times more on locking up our young people than it does on backing projects to stop them getting involved in crime in the first place. </p> <p><strong>Sport is supposed to have taken the place of war between democracies</strong>. So where does that leave Russia and Georgia? </p> <p>A century ago the modern Olympics were reborn in London. Ninety years ago, the liberal US president Woodrow Wilson outlined his 14 points for peace in Europe, calling for the different nationalities to have their own states, protected by international agreement. </p> <p>The Wilson doctrine was based on the on the principle of \"justice to all peoples and nationalities, and their right to live on equal terms of liberty and safety with one another, whether they be strong or weak\". </p> <p>Sending independent peace-keepers to South Ossetia now may be the best way to secure all our liberty and safety for the future.</p> <p>Back in Beijing, as I write, the medal table gives Russia 11 medals to Georgia's 1. For shooting. </p> <p>If sport takes the place of war between democracies, then elections take place of civil war within them. Despite the criminal behaviour from <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7006231.stm\">Walthamstow</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/2504624/Ex-Tory-candidate-faces-jail-for-harassing-Lib-Dem-rivals.html\">Watford</a>, most politicians don't fight dirty. They genuinely want to make a difference. And so do the voters. </p> <p>Here in Islington, the voter registration forms are hitting the doormats, and people are looking ahead to their next chance to vote. Voter turnout rises in marginal seats; it makes sense that people vote when their vote makes a difference. And with Islington South one of the five most marginal Labour/Lib Dem seats, there's every reason for people to register to vote here. </p> <p>We were out canvassing on Monday night. As ever, the diversity of our supporters impresses me: the business studies student looking forward to voting for the first time; the housing activist training to be a mental health counsellor; the retired academics disillusioned with Labour; the building site supervisor who voted for Boris, but is backing me for Westminster. </p> <p>Also on Monday I visited Essex Road post office that we saved from closure earlier this year. Instead of closure, the Post Office found a franchisee, and Monday was their first day under the new management. </p> <p>Despite the rain, there were smiles all round from staff and the customers. One woman was there with her disabled husband. She told me, \"When you saved the post office, you saved my life.\" Even before the election comes, we've made a difference.</p>",
  "<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Obama-Nation-Jerome-R-Corsi/dp/1416598065\">scathing new biography</a> of Barack Obama that its publisher describes as \"meticulously researched and documented\", Jerome Corsi, the man who launched the original <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiftboating\">Swift Boat attack</a> on John Kerry, offers a searing take on Obama's background that's only slightly undermined by the fact that he appears to have made large amounts of it up, in his brain. As <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/us/politics/13book.html\">this</a> fact-checking piece notes, Corsi claims Obama has \"yet to answer\" whether he \"stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college, or whether his drug usage extended to his law school days or beyond,\" but actually he's done so twice. Then there's the mysterious case of how Obama <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200803170005\">attended a sermon by Jeremiah Wright as late as 2007</a>, even though he actually didn't, and was in Florida at the time he was alleged to be there. Oh, and the thing about his secret half-sister, who for some reason, presumably a nefarious one, he doesn't mention at all in his memoir. Except for the part where he -- you know -- mentions her.

  "<p>The rival US presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain have a unique opportunity today to set aside their differences and celebrate a <a href=\"http://www.yourdictionary.com/sinister\">sinister common bond</a>.</p> <p>For no matter their political differences, they are united by one thing they share with approximately 10% of the world's population and five of the 12 men who've led the US since the second world war - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-handed\">left-handedness</a>.</p> <p>Today is <a href=\"http://www.lefthandersday.com/\">Left Handers' Day</a>, an event organised by the UK-based Left-Handers Club, to \"raise awareness of left-handedness and the challenges caused by living in such a right-handed world\" and \"dispel many of the <a href=\"http://www.sinistershop.com/language.htm\">superstitions and fictions that have surrounded left-handedness in many cultures</a> for hundreds of years\".</p> <p>Some - including the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/03/AR2008070303202.html\">Washington Post</a> - have argued that, far from being naturally disadvantaged, left-handed \"southpaws\" actually stand a better-than-average chance of reaching the White House.</p> <p>And the fact that Obama has just been named <a href=\"http://www.lefthandersday.com/lefthander2008.html\">Left-Hander of the Year</a> and even has a <a href=\"http://www.leftiesforobama.com/\">Lefties for Obama</a> support group surely can't hurt his chances.</p> <p>However, life for most lefties has <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-handed#Social_stigma_and_repression_of_left-handedness\">historically been tough</a>, they still suffer modern annoyances from problems with opening tins or using scissors to an inability to <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=ct_kEB2c2uY\">throw a standard boomerang</a>.</p> <p>In the run-up to the big day, the Left-Handers Club has been promoting <a href=\"http://www.anythingleft-handed.co.uk/acatalog/\">stores</a> catering exclusively for left handers and giving away <a href=\"http://www.lefthandersday.com/posters.html\">free posters</a> to encourage its members to create \"lefty zones\" in their offices and homes to show ignorant right handers how tough life can be for those in the minority.</p> <p>So, sinistrals of the world should take this annual opportunity to celebrate their differences and give themselves a hand - as long as it's not the right one.</p>",
  "<p>The US has refused an Israeli request for military hardware to assist with a strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, while warning against any such plan, according to a report today.</p> <p>Israel presented its list of desired military hardware and other backup for the strike during President George Bush's visit to Jerusalem in May, the Israeli newspaper, Ha'aretz, <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1010938.html\">said</a>.</p> <p>This was turned down with Washington officials insisting Israel give the US prior notice if it plans an attack.</p> <p>The US is among a group of nations which has sought to engage with Iran over its nuclear activities by offering a package of incentives if Tehran suspends uranium enrichment.</p> <p>Iran insists it is interested only in civil nuclear power but the US and EU claims it plans to build a nuclear bomb. </p> <p>Israel, which has its own undeclared nuclear arsenal, has warned Iran repeatedly against developing its own. A major Israeli air force exercise in June was viewed by observers as a veiled warning to Iran that Israel has the capability to attack the country's nuclear facilities.</p> <p>According to Ha'aretz, Bush held talks with the country's prime minister, Ehud Olmert, and defence minister, Ehud Barak, during which they requested \"certain specific items of military equipment\" as well as diplomatic backing.</p> <p>The paper - which does not specify the hardware sought \u2013 says that the US took this to imply an attack on Iran was imminent and sent a \"strong message\" to Israel not to do so. </p> <p>It also demanded prior warning of any attack, and offered in compensation to improve Israel's missile defence systems.</p> <p>Israel rejected this and warned it \"reserves the right to take whatever action it deems necessary\" if diplomatic efforts achieved nothing.</p> <p>Ha'aretz says Israel had hoped Bush would order an American strike before leaving office but that this was seen as unlikely. The country fears that an Israeli attack \"would give Iran international legitimacy for its programme, which it currently lacks\" and portray Israel as the aggressor.</p> <p>Israel believes that Iran will continue to stall, perhaps even temporarily suspending uranium enrichment, \"in an effort to see out the rest of Bush's term in peace\", the paper added.</p>",
  "<p>Former boilermaker John MacDougall rose from a working class background to take his seat at Westminster. </p> <p>The MP for Glenrothes, who died today aged 60, followed a well-trodden old Labour path, through unions and the local political scene of the 60s and 70s. </p> <p>Born on December 8 1947 in Dunfermline, Fife, MacDougall started work at the RGC oil rig construction yard at Methil, Fife, on the east coast of Scotland in 1964. </p> <p>It was here he got his first taste of politics, becoming a shop steward of the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trade Union (GMBATU) in 1978. </p> <p>He rose to became shop steward convener of the union and in this role visited parliament for the first time, little suspecting that this would later become his place of work. </p> <p>He strived to gain extra qualifications, studying naval architecture and also receiving a diploma in industrial management and became a member of the Institute of Industrial Managers. </p> <p>In 1981, MacDougall joined the Labour party and became chairman of his local branch. <br>He was elected to Fife council, where he served for nearly 20 years. </p> <p>For 14 years he was full-time at the local authority, where he held various posts including council leader for nine years. </p> <p>He was elected to parliament as an MP for Central Fife in 2001. </p> <p>He took over the seat from former Scotland first minister Henry McLeish, also a former Fife council leader, who stood down as an MP on his election to the Scottish parliament. </p> <p>MacDougall was re-elected in 2005 to the newly-created Glenrothes constituency, which took in most of the old Central Fife seat. </p> <p>As an MP, he was strongly pro-European with extensive connections in the European union. </p> <p>He was also vice-president of the Assembly of the European Regions for a time. </p> <p>He leaves a wife, Cathy, and two adult children. </p> <p>MacDougall's Glenrothes constituency is next door to that of the prime minister, Gordon Brown, Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. </p> <p>The last byelection fought in Fife, in February 2006, saw the Liberal Democrats seize power in a strong Labour seat. </p> <p>Labour had a majority of 11,500. But Lib Dem Willie Rennie overturned this, winning with a majority of 1,800 on a 16% swing.</p>",
  "<p> The Wall Street Journal compares presidential dimensions in a graphic earlier this month<br>The Washington Post <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/11/AR2008081102827_pf.html\">revisits</a> the timeworn but always entertaining Presidential Height Index, according to which the tallest candidate for US president has won on almost every occasion over the last century or so -- especially if you count Al Gore in 2000, cruelly denied the office thanks to some <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1197470/bio\">short Supreme Court judges</a>. So far, the minuscule size of John McCain, who under some conditions cannot actually be seen at all without the aid of an electron microscope, hasn't been a major problem, since he's mostly been standing on the podium alone. But as the blogger Saccharinist <a href=\"http://saccharinist.blogspot.com/2008/06/running-short-tall-tale-of-john-mccain.html\">notes</a>, that's about to change: at the post-convention presidential debates, the 6'1\" Obama will tower over him. As might his vice-president, depending on who he picks -- and that could spell trouble:</p> <blockquote> When Dukakis chose the 6'1\" (1.85m) Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate for the 1988 presidential campaign against 6'2\"\" (1.88m) George Bush the elder, it seemed like a good idea at the time -- an undoubtedly concerted effort to present a more balanced height average for the Democratic ticket. Sadly for Dukakis, none of his advisers succeeded (if they even tried) in predicting just how unfortunately silly a presidential candidate looks when his lesser-office partner towers above him. </blockquote> <br> <p>Generally speaking, pundits and political thinkers laugh off theories like the Presidential Height Index. They shouldn't. Gut reactions to the impression that a candidate makes, along with many <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/06/080623-polling-places.html\">other completely unexpected factors</a>, are <em>exactly</em> what determines election outcomes. And research has <a href=\"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4179/is_20000113/ai_n11739190\">already established</a> that taller men are more likely to marry and have children...</p>",
  "<p>Here's proof, if proof were needed, that the McCain campaign's advertising strategy is in fact being run by a crack team of six-year-olds, out of their minds on Sunny Delight. Yesterday they released a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQk2jtLZoJw\">new ad</a>, Fan Club, which continued to mock Barack Obama as a celebrity, this time on account of his \"dreamy eyes\". It included a brief clip of Mike Myers and Dana Carvey in Wayne's World (\"We're not worthy!\") -- but Myers objected, claiming copyright violation, and the ad was reissued without the clip. But wait for it: in this <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/mccainreport/Read.aspx?guid=271b9107-7174-4c9f-a621-077b5438c319\">killer response</a>, headlined Celebrities Fight Back, a McCain spokesman explains why Myers's objection just <em>proves the point they were making all along</em>:</p> <p>\"Obama's celebrity friends are bringing their considerable resources to bear in this election... threatening this campaign with legal action over our latest ad, Fan Club... Apparently, we are not, in fact, worthy.\"</p> <p>Get it? No, seriously, do you see the incredibly clever jujitsu move they just executed there? One can only imagine the sheer humiliation of so-called \"comedian\" Mike Myers this morning as he realises what a terrible error he made in deciding to tangle with the superior comedic talents of Team McCain. Idiot. [<a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/mccainreport/Read.aspx?guid=271b9107-7174-4c9f-a621-077b5438c319\">JohnMcCain.com</a>]</p>",
