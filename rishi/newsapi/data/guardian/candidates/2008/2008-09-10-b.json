  "<p>Bill Clinton met with families of the victims of 9/11 on the eve of the seventh anniversary of the attacks on New York and Washington, and called for unity to return to the United States.</p> <p>In the wake of his own bruising encounters on the campaign trail on behalf of his wife Hillary, and amid a presidential contest that is daily growing more ugly and rancorous, the former president bemoaned the current lack of togetherness, contrasting it with the mood that prevailed in the country immediately after the attacks.</p> <p>\"I will always remember the way New York and America came together on 9/11,\" he said. \"Every time we fail to do that when our national interest is involved, I wish we could recover it.\"</p> <p>Seven years on from the terrorist assault, in which almost 3,000 people died, help for the families of the victims remains mired in bureaucratic wrangling. Clinton addressed last night a conference organised by Voices of September 11th, a campaign run by and for families impacted by the tragedy, in a hotel in downtown Manhattan. </p> <p>Before speaking, he met with several representatives from the group and heard their complaints.</p> <p>He promised to work hard to rectify problems that have beset a multi-million dollar scholarship fund that he helped to set up that supports children of 9/11 victims through college. There has been criticism that funds awarded by the $27.3m scholarship have been inadequate.</p> <p>\"From my point of view, this is your money. This money was given for your benefit, for your children,\" he said.</p> <p>Clinton said he would also give \"real time\" to support Voices of September 11th in its on-going project to memorialise each of the victims of the attacks through a digital database. </p> <p>He said he thought it was of great importance, as a way of informing people in a hundred years time who had no experience of New York when the twin towers were still standing.</p> <p>He urged victims' families to ask themselves how they wanted their relatives to be remembered generations from now. \"We want them to know that these people were loved. That for a moment the whole country came together. That for a brief period this country had everyone on his side.\"</p> <p>In a pointed though unspoken reference to the Bush administration, he added: \"There will never be a time when everybody loves America, but we ought to be in the business of making a world with more partners, and fewer terrorists.\"</p> <p>Clinton will attend today's anniversary commemoration at Ground Zero, alongside both Barack Obama and John McCain. The two presidential candidates have promised to abide by a political truce for the day.</p>",
  "<p>The seven years since 9/11 reveal an old truth: problems are usually not solved, they are just overtaken by other problems. Those of 8/8, for instance. On August 8 2008, two mighty nations announced their return to history. Russia, invading Georgia, did it with tanks. China, launching the Beijing Olympics, did it with acrobats. The message was the same: world, we're back.</p> <p>Don't get me wrong. A grave threat from jihadist terrorists, potentially armed with atomic, biological or chemical weapons, hangs over us still. They have a faith-based ideology with proven appeal to a minority of disaffected Muslims, especially those living in the west, and the means to wreak cut-price mayhem are alarmingly easy to find. Even as you read this, another hard-to-detect groupuscule, working in a back room close to you, may have taken the occasion of the 9/11 anniversary to try again. They won't always be foiled. Protecting us from another 9/11, while not destroying our freedom in order to save it, remains a major challenge to political leadership in every free country. </p> <p>What has proved false is the neoconservative claim that this single threat defines the whole pattern of world politics in our time; that, as Norman Podhoretz puts it, the struggle against Islamofascism is world war four. Returning to the United States after a year's absence, I'm struck by how relatively little even the American right is talking about the \"war on terror\".</p> <p>Beyond terrorism, two giant changes define our world. Both can, to a large extent, be traced back to the worldwide spread of marketised economic development (or globalisation). The first is the \"rise of the rest\", made manifest on 8/8. Non-western powers challenge the economic dominance of the west. They are beating the west at the game it invented, and quietly changing the rules along the way. Analysts at Goldman Sachs predict that by 2040, China, India, Russia, Brazil and Mexico will have a larger combined economic output than today's G7. The date matters less than the trend. Even today, the shifts in economic power are translating into political and military power faster than many anticipated. </p> <p>At the same time, worldwide economic development on the basis of the free movement of goods, capital, services and, to a lesser extent, people, is exacerbating transnational problems. CO2 emissions that accelerate climate change, mass migration, the risk of pandemics: all these cry out for international, cooperative responses. The need for liberal international order has never been greater. Yet, by contrast with the 1990s, when president George HW Bush hoped to replace the cold war with a \"new world order\", the prospects of achieving it no longer look so good. Power is diffused to too many competing states, many of them illiberal, as well as elusive networks like al-Qaida.</p> <p>So we of the FLIO (friends of liberal international order) must now confront the prospect of a new world disorder. Or rather old-new, for disorder rather than order is the more natural condition of international society. International order, which may also be called peace, is a fragile achievement. It hardly needs repeating that in its response to the 9/11 attacks, the Bush administration has, over these seven lean years, contributed to the erosion, rather than the building, of international order. The Russian invasion of Georgia was, among other things, payback for the US invasion of Iraq.</p> <p>While order is threatened, liberty is no longer on the forward march. The French refer to their 30 years of economic growth after the second world war as the trente glorieuses. Future historians may regard the three decades from Portugal's revolution of the carnations in 1974 to Ukraine's Orange revolution in 2004 as trente glorieuses for the spread of liberty, in Europe but also in Latin America, Africa and parts of Asia. </p> <p>Russia and China are not just great powers challenging the west. They also represent alternative versions of authoritarian capitalism, or capitalist authoritarianism. Here's the biggest potential ideological competitor to liberal democratic capitalism since the end of communism. Radical Islamism may appeal to millions of Muslims, but it cannot reach beyond the umma of the faithful except by conversion. More important, it cannot plausibly claim to be associated with economic, technological and cultural modernity. </p> <p>By contrast, the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics, like the skyscrapers of Shanghai, show us how authoritarian capitalism already stakes that claim. In the Bird's Nest stadium, the latest audiovisual hi-tech was placed at the service of a hyper-disciplined collectivist fantasy, made possible by financial resources no democracy would have dared devote to such a purpose. Zhang Yimou, the artistic director of the games ceremonies, said only North Korea could have matched such feats of mass synchronisation.</p> <p>For close to 500 years, modernity has come from the west. The historian Theodore von Laue called this The World Revolution of Westernisation. In 20th-century Europe, liberal democracy faced two powerful versions of modernity that were western but illiberal: fascism and communism. Part of these systems' appeal was precisely that they were modern. (\"I have seen the future and it works,\" said one enthusiast, returning from Moscow.) Liberal democracy finally saw them both off, though not without a world war, a cold war, and a lot of help from the US. </p> <p>In China, we glimpse the prospect of a modernity which is both non-western and illiberal. But is authoritarian capitalism a stable, durable model? That, it seems to me, is among the greatest questions of our time, which is still a post-9/11 time, but also a post-8/8 time, and, ecologically, a five-minutes-to-midnight time.</p> <p>As we of the FLIO think about how to respond to this multiple-front challenge, I have more sympathy than many Europeans do for the notion, canvassed by American policy intellectuals supporting both John McCain and Barack Obama, of a \"concert of democracies\". We should look first to those countries who share our values in the way they govern themselves - and there are more of them now, after these trente glorieuses for liberty. But only with several vital caveats.</p> <p>First, we should not kid ourselves that we can have only liberal democracies as partners. Our values may pull us that way, but our interests will necessarily push us to relationships and even partnerships with currently illiberal states as well. So any institutionalised League of Democracies, arrayed against an Association of Autocrats (Robert Kagan's vivid term), is a seriously bad idea - even assuming you could agree who merits inclusion in the league. Bipolar disorder would be no improvement on multipolar.</p> <p>It's also not the smartest idea to identify this vision of a concert of democracies too emphatically with the west, as in the former French prime minister Edouard Balladur's proposal for what he calls a Western Union. Historically, both modernity and liberalism have come from the west. But the future of freedom now depends on the possibility of new versions of modernity evolving - whether in India, China or the Muslim world, which are distinctly non-western yet also recognisably liberal, in the core sense of cherishing individual freedom. I wouldn't bet on this outcome, but working towards it is the best long-term chance we have. Pessimism of the intellect must be matched by optimism of the will.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timothygartonash.com\">Timothygartonash.com</a></p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337503630\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Barack Obama yesterday rejected accusations that he had insulted the Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin with his remark that \"you can put lipstick on a pig, it's still a pig\" when describing John McCain's policies.</p> <p>Obama said the Republicans wanted to distract voters and the media from their failed record of governance with what he called \"the latest made-up controversy\".</p> <p>The Democratic presidential candidate had used the American colloquialism to mock the McCain campaign's effort to rebrand itself as a \"change\" campaign.</p> <p>The McCain campaign, which since last week has been quick to accuse the media and the Democrats of sexism in their criticism of Palin, rushed out an advertisement saying that Obama had \"smeared\" Palin. And, hoping to stoke anger among women voters, former Massachusetts governor Jane Swift accused the Illinois senator of insulting Palin by calling her a pig, pointing out that the Alaska governor is the only one of the four candidates in the race to wear lipstick. </p> <p>Obama said the McCain camp was using the \"lipstick\" issue to keep the media focused on trivialities and that the Republicans had taken an \"innocent remark\" about McCain's proposals out of context. </p> <p>\"The McCain campaign would rather have a story about phoney and foolish diversions than about the future,\" he said. \"We've got an energy crisis, we have an education system that is not working for too many of our children ... we've got two wars going on, veterans coming home, not being cared for, and this is what they want to talk about.\"</p> <p>McCain himself used the \"lipstick on a pig\" expression last autumn, saying Hillary Clinton's health care proposal departed little from that which she developed while first lady. At the Republican convention last week, Palin offered a cosmetic quip of her own: \"The difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? Lipstick.\"</p>",
  "<p>At least you can say it would never have happened had a woman not been running for vice-president: \"lipstick\" has become a buzzword in US politics.It smeared itself all over the news yesterday when it appeared that Barack Obama was likening Sarah Palin to a farmyard animal: \"You can put lipstick on a pig; it's still a pig,\" he told a town hall meeting in Lebanon, Virginia. In the wake of the much-aired joke Palin had made about herself during her speech to the Republican convention last week - \"What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pitbull? Lipstick\" - it seemed clear to some that the Democrat was slinging insults at his rival.</p> <p>Except he wasn't. The \"lipstick on a pig\" phrase is a fairly commonly used American idiom of long standing, indicating an attempt to jazz up some old goods with a cosmetic tweak. Obama's remarks came in the context of a longer attack on McCain's attempt to position himself as a force for change in Washington. The fuller quote from the Virginia meeting goes, \"That's not change. That's just calling the same thing something different. But you know, you can put lipstick on a pig; it's still a pig. You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper and call it change; it's still going to stink.\"</p> <p>Obama used the same phrase, talking about General Petraeus's task in Iraq, in an interview with the Washington Post last year. In April, Elizabeth Edwards (wife of former presidential hopeful John Edwards) used it to describe McCain's health care plan.</p> <p>Nor do Democrats have sole rights to pig and lipstick-based analogies. Dick Cheney used it about John Kerry in 2004. Torie Clarke, McCain's former press secretary, wrote a book called Lipstick on a Pig: Winning in the No-Spin Era. And even McCain has called on it, using it last year to attack one of Hillary Clinton's proposed policies: \"I think they put some lipstick on a pig,\" he said, \"but it's still a pig.\"</p> <p>He must have a short memory, however, because the Republicans wasted no time in taking carefully orchestrated offence at the \"gendered\" comparison of Palin to a pig. Which, let's not forget, didn't happen. The Obama campaign responded by calling the McCain team \"dishonourable\".</p> <p>Now that, my friends, is an insult.</p>",
  "<p>For months Gordon Brown has been going to painstaking lengths to avoid the greatest mistake a foreign leader can make during a US presidential election: to show the slightest hint of favouritism to one candidate.</p> <p>But No 10's careful choreography fell apart yesterday after the prime minister appeared to endorse Barack Obama in an article in the Parliamentary Monitor magazine. What had been pencilled in the Downing Street grid as an anodyne article for a worthy, but hardly best-selling magazine, ended up leaving Brown attempting to play down an embarrassing intrusion into the US presidential campaign. </p> <p>It was too late, however, to stop the article prompting John McCain's team to raise \"concerns\" over the article with the British embassy in Washington. Perhaps more damagingly, a senior McCain adviser posted a witheringly sarcastic blog on the campaign's website under the headline: The Coveted Gordon Brown Endorsement. </p> <p>As the story gathered momentum on the web, the PM sanctioned a frantic round of phone calls to the Republican camp to ram home his central defence: he had not penned the words in questions.</p> <p>The diplomatic slip first came to light on Tuesday when the Parliamentary Monitor circulated copies of the article. Initial reports highlighted the prime minister's comments that he had embarked on a domestic rethink. But tucked away in the piece was a more contentious paragraph. \"In the electrifying US presidential campaign it is the Democrats who are generating the ideas to help people through more difficult times,\" Brown wrote. \"To help people from losing their home, Barack Obama has proposed a Foreclosure Prevention Fund to increase emergency pre-foreclosure counselling and help families facing repossession.\"</p> <p>The article found its way to the Drudge Report, guaranteeing that it would be seen by the US political classes - and in no time McCain's campaign had fought back.</p> <p>In his blog post, the McCain spokesman Michael Goldfarb used the article to a dig at both Brown and Obama by pointing out that the Democrats had abandoned the policy highlighted by the prime minister.</p> <p>\"Far be it from this campaign to underestimate the value of an endorsement from British prime minister Gordon Brown, but there is a slightly embarrassing detail that this endorsement is bound to highlight ... Obama had championed a Foreclosure Prevention Fund but sometime late last month he seems to have ... changed his position.\"</p> <p>Alarmed by this jibe, senior No 10 officials went into overdrive to explain the mistake. The article, they said, was an early draft based on a briefing note prepared by the prime minister over the summer. The contentious section reflected Brown's view that the Democrats have interesting policies to help people struggling with mortgages. But Brown was careful about how he mentioned Obama in his note.</p> <p>This subtlety was missed in the article. It is understood that the official drafting of the article incorporated Brown's note then passed it up the chain in No 10 for approval. </p> <p>The official later sent the article to the magazine wrongly believing it had been approved. While speaking at a press conference in Downing Street with his Italian counterpart, Silvio Berlusconi, Brown made clear yesterday that he would not endorse a candidate. </p> <p>Pointing out that he had met McCain and Obama in Washington and London, a smiling prime minister said: \"I have a great admiration for both of these very distinguished senators. The decision of the American people is the decision that will be the right one and it is a matter for the American people.\"</p> <p>Berlusconi did not help matters, though, as he stressed the importance of remaining neutral. \"It would be totally absurd to say you prefer one person over another.\"</p> <p>Mindful of John Major's experience in 1992, when officials reportedly rummaged through home office files to dig up damaging details about Bill Clinton's student years in Oxford, Brown had issued strict instructions to officials and ministers last year - Britain was to remain studiously neutral in the most exciting US presidential election in years.</p> <p>William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, said: \"Gordon Brown's comments will not only have annoyed Republicans but also have lent support to a policy the Democrats have dropped. The prime minister is not only out of order, he is already out of date.\"</p>",
  "<p>For a few minutes yesterday, amid the thousands of cheering supporters, John McCain could at last feel like a political star. If he could only ignore the chanting: \"Sarah, Sarah\".</p> <p>That is the sting of reflected glory, but if McCain is suffering a damaged ego at being overshadowed by his vice-presidential running mate, Sarah Palin, he showed no sign of it. </p> <p>The hockey mum turned Alaska governor has replicated among Republicans the kind of excitement that Democratic activists had for Barack Obama. </p> <p>Yesterday, with the Obama camp on the defensive against Republican attacks and on the slide in the opinion polls, it was the Republicans' turn to ride a surge of popularity with McCain attracting the biggest crowds since he began his run for the White House.</p> <p>McCain, who has struggled for months to attract more than a few hundred people to his events, seemed overcome by the sight of so many people spilling out over a lush green Virginia lawn. \"I am so grateful for this turnout,\" he shouted.</p> <p>But the crowds, with their Republican red T-shirts and \"No-bama, Go-mama\" badges, were not entirely there for McCain. Some admitted they may not even have bothered to go out to vote for McCain in November if he had not chosen Palin as his running mate. \"She definitely for me makes it a slam dunk,\" said Brian Sullivan, a photographer. \"He was already my pick anyway, but this makes it a slam dunk.\"</p> <p>In her 10 days on the national stage, Palin has deviated little from her wildly popular convention speech. She has delivered an abbreviated and tamer version in rallies in Missouri, Pennsylvania, and yesterday in Virginia, which Obama is hoping to turn to the Democrats this year, counting heavily on independent voters in northern suburbs like Fairfax.</p> <p>On stage yesterday Palin, in red high heels with her trademark severe suit, dispensed with her cosy preamble about being a hockey mum and raising five children. She made a bold play for Obama's message of change, accusing the Democrat of being blind to the changes underway in Iraq. \"Our opponent, he still can't bring himself to acknowledge that coming victory in Iraq,\" she said.</p> <p>Palin then went on to the populist economic themes that resonate with Republican voters fed up with the Bush administration's high spending on the Iraq war: her claim to slashing bloated state budgets in Alaska. \"I put the state's chequebook online for all the world to see,\" she said. \"That state luxury jet - that was a little over the top - so I put it on eBay.\" Then she told how she blocked a wasteful bridge project. \"I told Congress thanks, but no thanks, for that bridge to nowhere.\"</p> <p>Since Palin burst on the national scene, the Republicans have been forced to admit that Alaska's plane did not actually sell on eBay. Campaign aides also admit that Palin was originally for the \"bridge to nowhere\" before opposing it. </p> <p>Further revelations are in the pipeline. Palin headed home to Alaska yesterday to prepare for her first television network interview. Other news organisations are poring over her finances, her style of caribou hunting and her children's lifestyles.</p> <p>Those details do not matter to Palin's fans, who see her as the most exciting force in presidential politics for years. For committed Republicans, especially social conservatives, she is the binding factor convincing them to vote for a candidate who has somehow never been an entirely comfortable fit with his party base.</p> <p>\"I liked McCain, but I was a little wishy-washy,\" said Michelle Ferry, an army wife and estate agent, with a baby daughter. \"I might not have even voted before.\"</p> <p>Cathy Sweetser, a bank worker, said she felt emotionally spent by the encounter. \"She has brought youth, the female factor, the younger generation. She has brought, most importantly to me, a lot of women who were sitting on the fence.\"</p> <p>Republicans at the rally are open about their previous misgivings about McCain. </p> <p>At 72, he was too old to be president. He was not a true conservative. He was \"too Washington\", a prisoner of his 20 years in the Senate in an election when voters seem to want to turn the clock back to Year Zero. And he was dull. Those doubts seem erased with Palin by McCain's side. She provides the excitement, the youth, and the conservative credentials McCain needed. She also gives him an opening to women voters.</p> <p>The Republicans are also aggressively courting supporters of Hillary Clinton who have yet to warm to Obama. Opinion polls suggest Palin's selection has helped McCain to win over white women voters. </p> <p>The campaign pressed that home yesterday, with speakers including two women who once counted themselves as Democrats, but were now with McCain. </p> <p>The appeal is unlikely to go over well with committed Republican women, who generally are hostile to Clinton. But others say they see the same steely intelligence in Palin as they did in Clinton. \"I voted for Hillary,\" said Maria Juliano, a fashion consultant. \"I see the same intelligence and guts I saw in her in Palin. She can hold her own against any man and all the politicians - just like Hillary.\"</p>",
  "<p>What happened on September 11 2001, and what has happened since? The attack on the twin towers is now history but it is still history which we do not understand very well. Reactions at the time ran from the apocalyptic to the dismissive. Everything would soon be back to normal, said some. Nothing would ever be the same again, said others. </p> <p>Seven years later it can be said that both camps were right. Things did go back to normal, if by \"normal\" you include the casualty lists from Iraq and Afghanistan, and those from the terrorist attacks in Madrid, London, Bali and elsewhere. But such horrors, for Americans and Europeans at least, mingle now with the usual round of celebrity chatter, economic crisis, spring sales, endangered species, elections, new movies, road accidents, and food scares, just another part of the jangled wallpaper of our lives. </p> <p>Yet that there has been a profound change is undeniable, even if most of us, most of the time, do deny it. The bags with torches, water, first aid items and canned food stowed at the back of the cupboard or under the stairs in homes in Washington, London and Paris may have been long since unpacked. But a well-managed chemical, biological or nuclear attack could terribly damage or totally destroy any one of those cities, or any city in the world, at any moment. Those whose job it is contemplate these prospects on a daily basis pale at the thought, while the rest of us avert our eyes.</p> <p>A few of the terrorist attempts of the past seven years have been successful, but fortunately less than devastating. Most have been incompetent, and many have been detected and monitored by alert security forces, as the liquid bombs case has just reminded us. There is comfort here, but small comfort. Two curves on the graph chart the future. One is the curve of their competence, or even just their luck, as they would see it. The other is the curve of our competence, not only in the narrow sense of defending ourselves, but in the broader sense of changing the world in such a way that our enemies also change, embracing less vicious ways of achieving their objectives. </p> <p>A year or so ago the verdict on our performance would have been harsh: two bad wars, with a third one brewing, abrogations of the law and civil liberties that were as deplorable as they were ineffective, alienated minorities in many countries, and a relationship between the west and the Muslim world marked by misunderstanding and hostility. Today it might be a shade or two less withering. One war has lessened in its intensity, while the prospect of an American attack on Iran has dwindled. A general recognition that the Bush administration's violations of the law were counterproductive is evident across the political spectrum, even if it is also evident that ingenious new ways of circumventing the law are still being found. Second thoughts in some of the other 80 countries which have passed dubious counterterrorism legislation are emerging. Hard although it is to track, it may be that alienation among Muslim minorities in Europe is down, a product of efforts on both sides to improve understanding. </p> <p>Even the Bush administration has moved away from the idea of a \"war\" on terror. General Richard Myers, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in 2005 that \"if you call it a war, then you think of people in uniform being the solution\". Men like Robert Gates, the secretary of defence, and David Petraeus, the new head of the US Central Command, understand that principle very well. It is dismaying that John McCain, unlike Barack Obama, seems locked into the monolithic view of a single enemy and an ultimate military victory that others have rightly discarded. American voters in particular should grasp that our common engagement with terrorism is not a war. It is far more important than that.</p>",
  "<p>Every word Europeans (and many Americans) hear about Sarah Palin chills their blood - none more so than <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article4720440.ece\">her religious beliefs</a>, or at least those of her pastors at the Wasilla Assembly of God church, or the Juneau Christian Centre. But even as it does so, the social conservatives of the American religious right flock ever more enthusiastically to her support.</p> <p>She's saying all the right things for them, and what does it matter what effete, Islamo-friendly, panty-waisted, God-denying, anti-Christian, sopping wet liberal European surrender monkeys think? They don't have a vote, so there. And they probably have bad teeth.</p> <p>Palin's emergence has enthused the religious right, many of whom had thought they might have to sit out this year's presidential election because of the lack of a suitable candidate to vote for. They didn't - and don't - trust John McCain, good Episcopalian Anglican that he is, almost equivalent to calling him a Marxist in some religious eyes, because he hasn't enthusiastically signed up to any of their agenda, particularly abortion.</p> <p>But they like what they hear about Palin, even though she has said very little about her beliefs, or anything else, in recent days. For them the fact that she might be only a heartbeat away from the presidency is a reassurance not a worry. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dobson\">James Dobson</a>, head of Focus on the Family, the influential and deeply conservative radio and televangelist (though he is a child psychologist by training, not an ordained minister) who preaches daily to 20m Americans through 4,000 radio stations and 500 local newspapers and sees himself as an influential kingmaker in Republican circles, having said earlier in the spring that he could never vote for McCain, now says - phew! - that <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0808/Dobson_greenlights_McCainPalin.html\">Palin has won him over</a>.</p> <p>At this stage, it's not so much the policies - this isn't a campaign about issues, as one of McCain's aides said the other day - it is the words voters are listening for. George Bush (like McCain brought up an Episcopalian and now, only marginally less troublingly, a Methodist) earned their votes by saying all the right things, hitting all the buzzwords and phrases - the so-called \"God Talk\" - and they hope that she will do the same if given the chance.</p> <p>During one televised debate in 2000, Bush was famously asked who was his <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week410/cover.html\">favourite philosopher</a> and answered, without missing a beat, \"Christ. Because he changed my heart,\" an answer credited with winning over a large slice of the religious vote. Remember: that vote is estimated to make up about 23% of the US electorate, but its importance is that it can be mobilised and turns out on election day, unlike half the electorate, so its weighting is disproportionate even to its size. Bush won 78% of religious voters in 2004. Add to that that it is heavily represented in the south, midwest and west, states which already have a disproportionate weighting in the electoral system, and its importance cannot be overestimated.<br> And Palin seems to have the words. They're not so worried about what she thinks about how to solve the subprime mortgage crisis, but that she routinely <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.sarahpalin3\">invokes God at every opportunity</a>, whether advocating the exploitation of the Alaskan oil reserves or prosecuting the war on terror. That she may also be a believer in Creationism - or at least its ostensibly slightly more secular incarnation, Intelligent Design - is a bonus. That she may have asked about banning books in libraries is also a good sign.<br> As is the fact that she has encouraged her teenaged unmarried daughter to have her baby: abortion of the child, or her Down syndrome son, would have been unthinkable and would have had the side-effect of making her an impossible candidate for the vice-presidency, or even probably the mayoralty of Wasilla. The fact that leaders of the religious right and their shock-jock cheerleaders would have excoriated Michelle Obama if one of the Obama daughters had been old enough to have conceived a child out of wedlock is neither here nor there. They, of course, did not scruple to describe Mrs Obama as a baby-momma, slang for a juvenile, black, unmarried mother.</p> <p>The fact that Palin's religious principles and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/09/uselections2008.sexeducation\">abstinence training</a> evidently had little effect on her 17-year-old's sexual practices can be ignored, and her insistence that the children should be carried to term spun as a cause for celebration, not concern. Many of us might agree with those decisions, even as we find the one-eyed hypocrisy with which the right casually smears the personal lives of its opponents while demanding respect for the privacy and integrity of its own candidates deeply dispiriting.</p> <p>From what we know of Palin's religious background, the fact that she was born a Catholic and is now a Pentecostalist may be unusual in British or European terms, but is not at all so in the US, where many religious folk change their denominational allegiances during the course of their lives as their beliefs or circumstances change. Pentecostalism, with the attendant beliefs of many of its sects and adherents in the Rapture and the End Days or indeed the full blood-curdling theory of Premillenial Dispensationalism, is a fairly rarefied flower even among evangelicals in Britain (except for in the majority black churches), but is widely held in American Protestant sects.</p> <p>The theory, based on over-literalist extrapolations of interpretations from verses in the Book of Revelation, was formulated largely by Englishmen, notably the 19th-century evangelist John Nelson Darby, and has spawned a whole political belief system especially impinging on some American attitudes to the Middle East, scene of the putative final battle of Armageddon.<br> The key will be whether, in the unlikely event of Palin having any say in foreign policy in a McCain administration, she would wish to base her attitude and the administration's policy toward Israel and Palestine on such a weird set of ideas. If she did, there are plenty of Pentecostalists in the US and across the third world - Pentecostalism being arguably the fastest-growing religious movement in the world and now the second-largest Christian denomination with 500m followers - who would find her beliefs perfectly unexceptionable.</p> <p>In that sense, the raucous religious right in the US is correct to jeer that it is Europe that is out of step in deriding fundamentalism, rather than the likes of Sarah Palin. The idea of American policy based on the sort of ideas in Tim LaHaye's Left Behind series of novels - 60m copies sold to hockey moms and their husbands in the last few years - is just too bizarre to contemplate. Isn't it?</p>",
  "<p>John McCain, as a solo act, was never going to be a star in his own right. But for a few minutes today amid thousands of cheering supporters he could feel like one - if he only ignored the chanting: Sarah, Sarah.</p> <p>That's the sting of reflected glory. For McCain that is the price for choosing a running mate in Sarah Palin, the hockey mum turned Alaska governor who has replicated among Republicans the kind of excitement Democratic activists had for Barack Obama.</p> <p>But it also makes McCain seem strangely like a supporting player at his own presidential campaign. Today's crowds dutifully wore their McCain buttons and praised the candidate's war record in Vietnam and long years in the Senate, but if not for Palin's appearance on the Republican ticket, would they have made it to the rally today?</p> <p>Probably not, some said. A number said they may not have even bothered to go out to vote for McCain next November if he had not chosen Palin was his running mate.</p> <p>\"She definitely for me makes it a slam dunk,\" said Brian Sullivan, a photographer. \"He was already my pick anyway, but this makes it a slam dunk.\"</p> <p>Organisers said today's rally in Fairfax, a suburb of Washington, DC, was the biggest since McCain and Palin took to the road together, energising hardcore supporters, and boosting the Republican's popularity among white women.</p> <p>The turnout was almost overwhelmingly white, but it was also younger than most Republican events, with young families, and parents bringing school-age children.</p> <p>Some estimates put the crowd at above 15,000, or about twice the population of Palin's hometown in Wasilla, Alaska.</p> <p>It is also the last - at least for a couple of days. Palin was headed home to Alaska today.<br>In her 10 days on the national stage, Palin has deviated little from her wildly popular - among Republicans anyway - convention speech, delivering an abbreviated and tamer version in rallies in Missouri, Pennsylania and today Virginia.</p> <p>Barack Obama is hoping to turn the once reliably Republican state to the Democrats this year, and is counting heavily on independent voters in northern suburbs, such as Fairfax.</p> <p>On stage today, flanked by McCain and her husband, Todd, Palin wore her now-trademark severe dark suit and updo. Cindy McCain, in parrot green and pearls, stood a few steps behind the trio.</p> <p>On this occasion, Palin dispensed with her cosy preamble about being a hockey mum, and raising five children, and went straight into a recital of her cost-cutting measures as governor of Alaska and extolling McCain's stand on Iraq.</p> <p>\"I put the state's cheque book on line for all the world to see,\" she said. \"That state luxury jet - that was little over the top - so I put it on eBay.\"</p> <p>Then she told how she blocked a wasteful bridge project. \"I told Congress, 'thanks but no thanks for that bridge to nowhere'.\"<br>Since Palin burst on the national scene, the Republicans have been forced to admit that the plane did not actually sell on eBay. Campaign aides also admit that Palin was originally for the bridge, before opposing it.</p> <p>But those details didn't matter to the crowds, who saw Palin as the most exciting force in presidential politics for years. For committed Republicans, she was the binding factor convincing them to vote for a candidate who had somehow never been an entirely comfortable fit with his party base.</p> <p>\"I liked McCain, but I was a little wishy-washy,\" said Michelle Ferry, an army wife and realtor with a newborn daughter. \"I might not have even voted before Sarah.\"</p> <p>\"She's fantastic,\" said Cathy Sweetser, who works at a local bank. \"She brought to the campaign that change is not just an ivory tower. She has brought the youth, the female factor, the younger generation. She has brought most importantly to me, a lot of women who were sitting on the fence.\"</p> <p>Before Sarah Palin arrived on the ticket, even the most loyal Republicans had had doubts about McCain, serious doubts.<br>McCain - on his own - was too old to be president. He was not a true conservative. He was \"too Washington,\" a prisoner of his two decades in the Senate in an election when voters seem to want to turn the clock back to Year Zero. And he was a little dull.</p> <p>In the days since the convention, McCain, too, appears to be feeding off the excitement off the crowd. He is more animated on the stump in recent days, and the campaign more confrontational in trying to claim the mantle of change from Obama.</p> <p>\"Our opponent is an agent of change. He has changed his position on just about every issue,\" said Fred Thompson, the Law and Order actor and one-time presidential candidate, now taking second billing to the McCain-Palin double act.</p> <p>The Republicans are also aggressively courting supporters of Hillary Clinton who have yet to warm to Obama. Opinion polls suggest that the effort - plus Palin's selection - have helped McCain win over white women voters.</p> <p>The campaign pressed that home today, with a line-up of speakers that included two women who had once counted themselves as Democrats, but were now with McCain. \"I might not agree with Senator McCain and Governor Palin on all the issues, but I don't agree with any candidate all the time,\" said Lynette Long, a former Clinton supporter, who said women had been treated shabbily by the Democrats.</p> <p>The appeal to Clinton supporters is unlikely to go over well with committed Republicans. A number of women in the crowd were hostile to Clinton. But others say they see the same steely intelligence in Palin as they did in Clinton.</p> <p>\"I voted for Hillary,\" said Maria Juliano, a fashion consultant. \"I see the same intelligence and guts I saw in her in Palin.\"</p> <p>She added: \"She can hold her own against any man and all the politicians - just like Hillary.\"</p>",

  "<p>Jerome Corsi, PhD is the Lord High Admiral of the Swift-boat Armada now <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/us/politics/13book.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin\">heading against Barack Obama</a>. Still doing the hornpipe over his success sinking John Kerry, since his book Unfit for Command, plus a few million in conservative foundation dollars helped torpedo the Democratic candidate below the water-line even before he noticed, Corsi has now launched <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Obama-Nation-Leftist-Politics-Personality/dp/1416598065/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1220977645&amp;sr=8-1\">Obama Nation</a> into the New York Times bestseller lists.<br> Generally only dubious scientists, quack doctors and freaky cosmologists dress themselves in a little brief acronymic authority by putting their titles after their name on the cover of books. Corsi repeats his (apparently genuine) PhD on every single verso page heading.</p> <p>Nor does the bestseller list mean best read, as the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/books/bestseller/besthardnonfiction.html\">far-too-discreet little dagger</a> next to Obama Nation and several other current conservative hatchet jobs indicates. It means that there have been bulk purchases from bookshops. If a foundation wants to give away free books, it can get a bulk wholesale rate directly from the publishers. Paying retail for bulk buys is more expensive, but it's an effective way to puff them onto the bestseller list.<br> Even so, I do appreciate writers like <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/fact-or-fiction-the-incredible-world-of-kitty-kelley-428539.html\">Kitty Kelly</a>, when they scrutinise the toe-jam on the clay feet of the great, good and royal, so I tried to appreciate Corsi's opus as an example of that genre. Obama is not perfect, after all, and it always helps to temper optimism with realism.<br> However, I almost gave up reading during the introduction, when Corsi referred to his extensive \"footnoting all references so readers can determine for themselves the truth and validity of the factual claims.\" Truth and validity, a tautology, elides into an oxymoron: fact and claims are different animals outside the faith-based universe. He refers to Obama's \"pattern of voting on the far left on a wide range of policy issues,\" which is only true if you consider Margaret Thatcher to be a charter member of the Weathermen. Even more risibly, Corsi suggests that Obama would \"lead the United States in a costly and self-destructive direction, both at home and abroad. \u2026 We would be a militarily weakened and economically diminished nation\". Presumably, a less faith-based Corsi might note that his hypothetical state of the nation under Obama is the actual state after two terms of George Bush. Corsi avers: \"Growing numbers of largely Hispanic illegal immigrants, many of them still citizens of their home countries \u2026 live in our midst with no firm purpose or requirement to become American citizens.\" I suspect that most of them are unaware that US passports are on offer. This is the voice of prejudice that in one breath condemns immigrants for both taking our jobs while living on welfare!</p> <p>Corsi expands his almost limitless ability to have his cake and eat it when he cites Wall Street Journal and Fox consultant John Fund, who complains that Obama beat Alan Keyes, an \"unserious\" GOP candidate, to get in the Senate. This is true, but Keyes and Corsi himself were recently trying to get the <a href=\"http://www.constitutionparty.com/\">Constitution party</a> <a href=\"http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=55735\">nomination for the presidency</a>. Unseriousness is clearly contagious.</p> <p>On the other hand, Corsi is not always completely wrong. His analysis of Hillary Clinton's mistake in <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/seven/05092008/news/nationalnews/hill_drops_a_racial_bomb_110095.htm\">using the race card</a> is quite accurate, even though his claim that her \"campaign attacks against Barack Obama legitimised many of the lines of inquiry explored in the first two sections of this book,\" is a stretch. Her campaign no more justifies his \"lines of inquiry\" than his book retrospectively koshers her cynical use of the race card.</p> <p>Occasionally Corsi asks legitimate questions, but he consistently refuses to accept legitimate answers, and it would appear that his sole purpose in examining some of the weirder myths of the blogosphere is to keep them afloat. For example, he says magnanimously: \"I accept Obama's statement that he is a Christian, but take exception to the claim that Obama was not introduced to Islam as a child.\" But who made that claim? Obama's team said that he had never been a Muslim, not that he not been \"introduced to Islam\" the same way that I was \"introduced to Anglicanism\" when dragooned to Church for the school Founder's Day service.<br> With spurious academic authority he declares: \"We have already established that Obama wrote the autobiography to hide key points.\" Oh no, we haven't. Obama's books probably do suffer from overhyping, but he was explicit that these are not autobiographical chronicles. So when Obama says he used marijuana, it does not earn him brownie points for being unevasively un-Clintonian, or indeed un-Bushian. Rather it is a cynical political prophylactic against the chance of him being revealed. Corsi joined in hounding Obama to disown the Rev Jeremiah Wright, then attacking his disloyalty to his old mentor when he did. McCarthy meets Kevin Bacon, as acquaintances of acquaintances are marshalled and alleged to be communist or Muslim, in that modern form of conservative colour-blindness where red and green are indistinguishable. People like Saul Alinsky (the guru of community organisers) died never meeting Obama. But some people he knew did, and so \u2026 . Perhaps most bizarre, if you are not attuned to the conservative evangelical fixation on Kenya, is Corsi's depiction of Obama's involvement there. For the rest of the world, an authoritarian tribalist government fixed an election but was forced to compromise with the democratic winner in the face of riots. To the evangelical right, despite <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10415208\">\"credible signs of electoral fraud\"</a> Kenyan President Kibaki is a hero, not to be overthrown by the mere casting of ballots.<br> In Corsi's narrative, Obama's Luo tribal paternity led him to intervene on behalf of a \"communist\" (incidentally Anglican) Odinga, who was furthermore a Muslim stooge pledged to introduce Sharia law in an overwhelmingly Christian country. Obama \"could claim to be a Kenyan citizen\" \u2013 the same way, presumably that McCain could claim to a Panamian citizenship or the Clintons and Kennedys Irish, or indeed any Jewish politician could claim Israeli citizenship. It is typical of Corsi's use of sources that he quotes Mainu Wararu, \"respected international correspondent\", on the fears that Kikuyu have about Obama in the White House. However he skips Waruru's conclusion: \"This attitude is running counter to views of majority of Kenyans who are excited by every victory by the US democrat frontrunner and are praying day and night for more victories for this <a href=\"http://www.africanews.com/site/list_messages/16948\">'son of Kenya'</a>.\"<br> Incidentally, applying his own methodology that every accusation is true unless definitively disproven, I checked with Notre Dame professor <a href=\"http://www.nd.edu/~dmyers/\">Daniel Myers</a>, the custodian of the archives of the Lemberg Centre for the Study of Violence, which Corsi claims to have worked with. There is no record of his presence there. Of course, this does not prove that he wasn't \u2013 but he does not give his victim the same indulgence.<br> Corsi's smearing of fact, supposition and slander into a quantum slime really made me wish I had worn rubber gloves when reading. Nonetheless, Obama and his team should really read this book, even if it seems like turning over a stone to study the things that scurry from underneath. They do not need an enigma machine to plot the enemy fleet's manoeuvres. It's all here.</p>",
  "<p>The US military is not winning the war in Afghanistan and is \"running out of time\" for a workable strategy to combat the insurgency there, the Pentagon's uniformed leader said today.</p> <p>\"I'm not convinced we are winning it in Afghanistan. I am convinced we can,\" navy admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told Congress \u2013 the first sentence not present in his prepared testimony.</p> <p>The admission was a bleak reminder of the increasingly unstable and violent situation in Afghanistan seven years after western troops first toppled the Taliban. Analysts admit that al-Qaida and other militant groups are freely operating along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. </p> <p>Despite what Mullen called the \"desire\" of Nato commander David McKiernan for three more army brigades of soldiers in Afghanistan, George Bush said yesterday he would send one extra brigade and one new battalion of US marines.</p> <p>Mullen told members of the House of Representatives that he is working on a revised approach to the conflict \"that covers both sides of the [Afghanistan-Pakistan] border\", but he warned that it could be impossible to succeed without a more coordinated strategy. </p> <p>\"Absent a broader international and interagency approach to the problems there, it is my professional opinion that no amount of troops in no amount of time can ever achieve all the objectives we seek,\" Mullen said. </p> <p>The US military presence in Iraq is nearly three times as large as that in Afghanistan, where both Barack Obama and John McCain have backed adding more troops. The two candidates differ more markedly on Iraq: McCain blasts Obama's withdrawal plan there as an admission of loss at the expense of winning in Afghanistan. </p> <p>Mullen reminded Congress, however, that an effective strategy should involve more than military might but also economic and social development.</p> <p>\"Afghanistan doesn't just need more 'boots on the ground',\" Mullen said. \"It needs more trucks on those roads, more teachers in those schools, and more trained judges and lawyers in those courts.\"</p>",
  "<p>For anyone looking for a single succinct passage that epitomises everything that is wrong with <a href=\"http://jeffreygoldberg.theatlantic.com/bio.php\">Jeffrey Goldberg's</a> worldview, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/09/opinion/09goldberg.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=jeffrey%20goldberg&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin\">this is it</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The next president must do one thing, and one thing only, if he is to be judged a success: He must prevent al-Qaida, or a Qaida imitator, from gaining control of a nuclear device and detonating it in America. Everything else \u2014 Fannie Mae, healthcare reform, energy independence \u2014 is commentary.</p> </blockquote> <p>Even if you grant him the right to make a hyperbolic argument, the statement is absurd. The next president must do many things \u2013 not \"one thing only\" \u2013 if he is to be judged a success. And only some of those things involve preventing a nuclear attack on America.</p> <p>What we have here is basically the rehash of the Bush-neocon argument following 9/11 that the war on terror was to become the raison d'etre of our national government. Everything else took a backseat. And we can see where such an attitude led us. To disaster after disaster, whether it be domestic (Katrina) or foreign (Iraq). To the extent that John McCain adopts this political agenda as his own, it will doom his own presidency (should he be elected).</p> <p>A presidential agenda is the epitome of multi-tasking and juggling conflicting priorities. To the extent that any presidency becomes bogged down in, or obsessed by a single priority and takes its eye off the others \u2013 it must fail. The American people will simply not accept a monomaniacal president. In George Bush, we have come as close to that as we care to, and his cu<a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/polls/us/jobapproval-bush.php\">rrent approval ratings</a> indicate what our judgment has been.</p> <p>Goldberg is unintentionally ironic in making this claim:</p> <blockquote> <p>The nuclear destruction of Lower Manhattan, or downtown Washington, would cause \u2026 the comprehensive repudiation of America's culture of civil liberties.</p> </blockquote> <p>What does he think has been happening since 9/11? A civil liberties picnic? He also fails to understand this it is precisely rants like his own that cause Americans to be prepared to repudiate civil liberties.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the Times editors seem to have done a poor job of vetting statements such as this:</p> <blockquote> <p>Many proliferation experts I have spoken to judge the chance of such a detonation to be as high as 50% in the next 10 years.</p> </blockquote> <p>Which proliferation experts? And on what basis do they judge the possibility so likely? Might it be that some of these unnamed, unquoted alleged experts might have political axes of their own to grind? We actually can't be the judge of that since Goldberg conveniently omits any concrete reference to them.</p> <p>Here is another untested claim:</p> <blockquote> <p>Only technical complications prevent al-Qaida from executing a nuclear attack today.</p> </blockquote> <p>I simply must quote <a href=\"http://tonykaron.com/2008/09/09/all-the-hysteria-thats-fit-to-print-take-ii/\">Tony Karon's hilarious send-up</a> of this passage from his own blog:</p> <blockquote> <p>Is the New York Times edited by complete cretins?</p> <p>Only technical complications prevent my neighbour who smokes those horrible cigars from trading in his pit bull for a nuclear weapon. Only technical complications prevent me from turning my bicycle into a Maserati. And, technical complications aside, if my grandmother had had wheels, she'd have been a bus.</p> </blockquote> <p>Aside from technical complications, doesn't the tiny question of will come into play here as well? Meaning: does al-Qaida want to mount such a nuclear attack? Clearly, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/12/24/investigation.plane/\">Richard Reid</a> wanted to develop a dirty bomb. But what current intelligence indicates that al-Qaida is planning such an attack? I have seen none. Nor does Goldberg provide any. Since I am not an intelligence expert on this issue, it's possible that al-Qaida does want to mount such an attack. But you'll have to pardon me for preferring to see evidence on the subject before judging whether the claim is credible or not.</p> <p>Finally, in his <a href=\"http://jeffreygoldberg.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/05/mccain_on_israel_iran_and_the_1.php\">interview with John McCain</a>, Goldberg elicits a startlingly erroneous claim about Hamas' goals and he does nothing to point this out:</p> <blockquote> <p>I asked [McCain] not long ago whether he believes that America conflates its problem with Iran with Israel's Iran problem. \u2026 \"I think these terrorist organisations that [Iran] sponsors, Hamas and the others, are also bent, at least long-term, on the destruction of the United States of America.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>If Goldberg were a truly capable interviewer and reporter alarm bells should've been ringing both during the interview and in writing this column. Yet he appears not to have recognised the grievous error McCain has made. Hamas has never expressed interest either in the short or long term in \"the destruction of the US\". Not even Hezbollah has done so. But since he mentions Hamas and not Hezbollah, let's stick with Hamas. You can argue that Hamas is many bad things, but you simply cannot credibly argue as McCain claims. Goldberg should've called him on it and didn't. Another opportunity lost.</p> <p>Finally, there can be no doubt that national security is a critical component of a successful president's agenda. I am not minimising the threat posed by al-Qaida or any terrorist threat. But I am warning against the hysteria and paranoia characteristic of Goldberg's perspective on this issue. Just because a journalist pundit and the Republican crew are prepared to go overboard doesn't mean we all have to jump ship with them.</p>",

  "<p>Barack Obama today struck back at Republican accusations that he insulted the party's vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, in using a folk expression to describe John McCain's policies.</p> <p>In Virginia, the Democratic presidential candidate said McCain and the Republican party were trying to distract voters and the media from the Republicans' failed record of governance with what he called \"the latest <br>made-up controversy\".</p> <p>Obama was on the defensive after yesterday using an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/10/uselections2008.barackobama\">old American colloquialism</a> to mock the McCain campaign's effort to rebrand itself as a vehicle of \"change\".</p> <p>\"You can put lipstick on a pig,\" Obama said yesterday. \"It's still a pig.\"</p> <p>The McCain campaign, which since last week has been quick to accuse the media and the Democrats of sexism in their criticism of Palin, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/sep/10/uselections2008.johnmccain\">was outraged</a>.</p> <p>Hoping to stoke anger among women voters, McCain aides dispatched the former Massachusetts governor Jane Swift on a conference call with reporters to accuse the Illinois senator of insulting Palin, the Alaska governor. Swift said Obama had called her a pig, pointing out that Palin is the only one of the four candidates in the race who wears lipstick.</p> <p>The McCain campaign <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/sep/10/uselections2008.johnmccain\">today released an advertisement</a> saying Obama had \"smeared\" Palin.</p> <p>Campaigning in Virginia today, Obama said the McCain camp was using the lipstick matter to divert Americans and to keep the media focused on trivialities. He said the Republicans had taken an \"innocent remark\" about McCain's proposals \"out of context\".</p> <p>\"The McCain campaign would rather have a story about phoney and foolish diversions than about the future,\" he said.\"We've got an energy crisis, we have an education system that is not working for too many of our children.</p> <p>\"We've got two wars going on, veterans coming home, not being cared for, and this is what they want to talk about. This is what they want to spend two out of the last 55 days talking about.\"</p>",
  "<p>President Bush gave his last major foreign policy speech on Tuesday at the National Defence University (NDU) in which he rearticulated <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/09/20080909.html\">his perception</a> of leaving office with Iraq as a success story.</p> <p>In reality his speech and the potential of a baton-like foreign-policy handover to John McCain (now ahead in the polls) is evidence of the victory of a manipulated narrative over reality itself. </p> <p>Withdrawing 8,000 troops by February and claiming success is somewhat farcical. It would be an affront to the tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and US and international soldiers who have been maimed or killed over the last five years of violence in Iraq for this to stand unchallenged. While Bush has changed his policy on Iraq, from one that was faith-based to one more conscious of realpolitik, he cannot claim that the cost and repercussions of the Iraq fiasco constitute a success. </p> <p>Yet the narrative of success is both fluid and relative. Bush is attempting to bask in the reflected glory of the surge. He's like a man who set a house on fire asking for credit for pouring water on the smoking embers. </p> <p>Iraq is no more and has been replaced by a <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/212/story/52131.html\">fractured shell of civil unrest and violence</a>. If the Bush administration leaves behind one of the most unstable states in the world and defines it as success we can only find in our worst nightmares what he would see failure to be. </p> <p>To read Bush's speech at the NDU is to see a carefully constructed narrative. This story erases the Iraqi insurgency from history, replacing it with \"the tribes of Anbar\" fighting against \"al-Qaida's brutality\". Bush citied the turnaround of Anbar province as proof of US success claiming that: \"In 2006, a military intelligence report concluded that the province was lost \u2013 and Anbar was held up as proof of America's failure in Iraq\". Yet the report <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0911/dailyUpdate.html\">actually said</a> that Anbar was lost politically and not militarily \u2013 and the success of the surge was not US military increases. Essentially Anbar was won back by getting 100,000 of \"the enemy\" onto the US army's payroll, the so-called \"sons of Iraq\". </p> <p>It should not be forgotten that in 2006, Bush was still insisting in public that the US was winning the war; it was only in his head that his faith-based adventure was being challenged \u2013 as he <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/06/AR2008090602691.html\">outlined to Bob Woodward</a>: \"Underneath my hope was a sense of anxiety,\" he said. </p> <p>Is success having 140,000 US troops freezing a fractured status quo in Iraq while Russia, Iran and Syria rapidly advance their own foreign policy interests unchecked? </p> <p>General Petraeus, a frequent name dropped in any Bush speech, has made clear how reversible gains are in Iraq and the ebb and flow of events in Lebanon should serve as a stark reminder that weak states challenged by internally divided ethnic-sectarian populations do not make for stable politics. </p> <p>Barack Obama <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7605481.stm\">has accused</a> Bush of \"kicking the can down the road to the next president\". Both Iran and Syria, countries with serious influence in Iraq, have talked of waiting for a new US president before moving ahead with various initiatives. If McCain wins both Tehran and Damascus may push for Iraqi \"reverses\" to welcome the new/old US policies on Iraq. The loyalty of \"the sons of Iraq\" to US policy is unknown, as is the durability of Moqtada al-Sadr's ceasefire. Iraq remains combustible and whatever success Bush imagines he is retiring on is relative indeed. </p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/06/AR2008090602691_5.html?sid=ST2008090602917&amp;s_pos=\">Woodward's latest account</a> Bush's determination to succeed in Iraq is obvious, at one point he says: \"We must succeed, we will commit the resources to succeed. If they [the Iraqis] can't do it, we will.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the final narrative Bush will spin in retirement is that he would have succeeded in Iraq \u2013 if only the Iraqis hadn't been involved.</p>",

  "<p>Renowned climate scientist James Hansen today lent his voice to a US voter organising drive with an ambitious goal: enlisting 1m students who will cast their vote for the presidential candidate with the greenest energy record. </p> <p>The organising push, dubbed Power Vote, aims to harness young people's unprecedented engagement in the US elections and keep enthusiasm high for stronger action against climate change.</p> <p>Power Vote plans to dispatch organisers to college campuses across America, educating students about climate policy and capturing their information for mobilisation to the polls in November.</p> <p>The group's platform asks young people to endorse a ban on coal-fired power plants that do not workably capture carbon emissions \u2013 the signature proposal of Hansen, who served as Al Gore's science adviser.</p> <p>Both Barack Obama and John McCain have promised to pursue a cap-and-trade programme for limiting emissions, though neither candidate has recently emphasised climate change on the campaign trail.</p> <p>Hansen urged students to stay sceptical about the candidates' rhetoric. The Nasa scientist noted that he had just returned from an overseas trip \u2013 including a high-profile stop in the UK \u2013 and cast doubt on even foreign politicians' commitment to combating carbon.<br> \"Even in those places where we thought politicians were the greenest, in many cases it's a case of green-wash, where they're saying the right words but their actions don't correspond,\" Hansen said. </p> <p>\"You've got to ask the right questions and find out who's going to support your future.\"</p> <p>The non-partisan Power Vote drive is coordinated by the Energy Action Coalition, an alliance of 48 environmental groups that focus largely on college campuses.</p>",
  "<p>The Malaysian government has tried its utmost to keep Anwar Ibrahim, the leader of Malaysia's resurgent opposition, from power ever since he fell out of favour a decade ago.</p> <p>In the late 1990s, Anwar looked set to take over from Mahathir Mohamad, who guided Malaysia over 22 years to economic success. But mentor and protege had a bitter falling out over Malaysia's response to the Asian economic crisis in July 1997.</p> <p>Mahathir favoured currency and foreign investment controls. Anwar, who was then deputy prime minister and finance minister, implemented an austerity programme that slashed government spending and deferred infrastructure projects dear to Mahathir.</p> <p>The rift became irreparable, when Anwar \u2014 named by Newsweek as man of the year in 1998 \u2014 went on a campaign against corruption and cronyism that rankled many of the elite, including Mahathir's son, Mirzan who had myriad business dealings.</p> <p>In 1998, Anwar was accused of sodomising his wife's driver, convicted in 2000 and sentenced to nine years in prison amid widespread international protests. Anwar remains grateful to the British prime minister, Gordon Brown, among others who pleaded his cause and in 2004 Malaysia's supreme court overturned the verdict, although corruption charges against him stood. He was released later that year but was barred from standing for office until April this year.</p> <p>Following his release, Anwar held teaching posts at Oxford University and Georgetown University in Washington and pursued his campaign against corruption through his post as honorary president of AccountAbility, a London thinktank advocating better corporate governance.</p> <p>In his capacity as a campaigner against corruption, Anwar strongly criticised Britain's decision to halt a major corruption investigation into BAE, Britain's biggest arms company, in its dealings with Saudi Arabia. What signal did that send leaders in developing countries, he argued, as he submitted a letter to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development that was scathing of the government's decision.</p> <p>Even as he spoke out against international corruption, Anwar was plotting a political comeback. In an interview early last year he said was getting round his ban on speaking at public forms by addressing the public at funerals and feasts. He <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/15/malaysia\">made it clear that he was ready to challenge</a> the Malaysian political elite that sacked and imprisoned him.</p> <p>\"I am committed to a reform agenda, I believe in a democratic process and a more accountable government,\" he said then. \"I can't reasonably expect this to happen without political involvement. If I chose to submit, then I would give credence to the government and support their repressive measures.\"</p> <p>It was not just brave talk. First he helped the disparate opposition parties make huge inroads in parliamentary elections in March. The Barisan Nasional, a coalition of three racially based parties led by the United Malays National Organisation (Umno) that has dominated Malaysian politics since independence from Britain in 1957, saw its two-thirds majority evaporate. By contrast, the opposition parties saw their seats in the 222-member parliament jump to 82 from 19.</p> <p>Anwar's march back to power seemed unstoppable when he easily won a seat that he had previously held for 17 years. Out of the blue came <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/10/malaysia1\">new sodomy charges</a>, when a 23-year-old aide, Saiful Bukhari Azlan, accused Anwar of sodomising him, a charge that a prison sentence of 20 years in Malaysia, even between consenting adults.</p> <p>Despite the accusations, which he maintains are a transparent attempt to stop his political comeback, Anwar has raised the stakes by declaring that he will take power on September 16, Malaysian national day, by persuading enough government MPs to defect to the opposition. The government was rattled enough to send 50 MPs on a trip to Taiwan due to last more than a week to forestall such a move.</p> <p>As the government goes into political contortions to keep Anwar at bay, the opposition leader says he can get the 30 MPs he needs to bring down the government. If \u2014 and it remains a big if as the ruling party will do all it can to cling on to power \u2014 Anwar finally gets to lead Malaysia, what will this multi-racial country look like?</p> <p>Raja Petra Kamarudin, fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, <a href=\"http://mt.m2day.org/2008/content/view/12273/84/ \">wrote on Malaysia Today</a>, a website the Malaysian government is trying unsuccessfully to block: \"Anwar has to balance the aims of the parties in his coalition, and we will see compromises being made. That is the reality in Malaysia. But I think a culture of dialogue will be developed under his watch and that will be a great achievement indeed. I think at least that can be accomplished by him.\"</p> <p>Like Turkey, another Muslim country with its interplay of democracy and Islam, Malaysia will be closely watched to see how it copes with forces for change. Anwar firmly rejects the notion that Malaysia's \"democratic deficit\" has anything to with the fact that it is Muslim.</p> <p>\"The newly independent Muslim states were democracies,\" Anwar said. \"Indonesia had a free election in 1955 until it was hijacked by Sukarno. Iran had democratic elections only to be hijacked by the CIA, British intelligence and the oil companies. Seventy five to 80% of Muslims are familiar with the democratic process.\"</p>",
  "<p>Over the years, American politicians of all political stripes have applied a lot of lipstick to a lot of pigs, rhetorically speaking.</p> <p>It is not just Barack Obama, who this morning struck back at what he called \"the latest made-up controversy\" - Republican accusations that he insulted Alaska governor Sarah Palin by using a common folk expression to describe John McCain's policies.</p> <p>The Democratic presidential candidate yesterday said, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/sep/10/uselections2008.johnmccain\">\"You can put lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig\"</a>. He was speaking of the McCain campaign's effort to rebrand itself as a \"change\" campaign, rather than one founded on the former prisoner of war's experience in Vietnam and his 26 years in the US House of Representatives and Senate. Obama continued, \"You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change. It's still going to stink.\"</p> <p>The McCain campaign, which since last week has been quick to accuse the news media and the Democrats of sexism in their criticism of vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin, cried outrage. </p> <p>Hoping to stoke anger among female voters, McCain aides dispatched former Massachusetts governor Jane Swift on a conference call with reporters to accuse the Illinois senator of insulting Palin, who, Swift pointed out, is the only of the four candidates in the race who wears lipstick. This morning, the McCain campaign released to the media an advertisement saying Obama had \"smeared\" Palin.</p> <p>Campaigning in Virginia today, Obama said the McCain campaign is using the \"lipstick\" matter to distract Americans from Republican failures on the economy and other fronts, and keep the news media focused on trivialities.</p> <p>\"What their campaign has done this morning is what has made folks sick and tired of politics in this country,\" Obama said at a campaign event. He said the Republicans had taken an \"innocent remark\" about McCain's economic plan \"out of context\".</p> <p>\"Suddenly they say, 'Oh, you must be talking about the governor of Alaska. The McCain campaign would rather have a story about phoney and foolish diversions than about the future. We've got an energy crisis, we have an education system that is not working for too many of our children ... We've got two wars going on, veterans coming home, not being cared for, and this is what they want to talk about. This is what they want to spend two out of the last 55 days talking about.\"</p> <p>Observers from both sides of the political aisle have noted the expression is an old folk saying. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who is known to sling a folkism now and then, said last night, \"It's an old expression, and I'm going to have to cut Obama some slack on that one. I do not think he was referring to Sarah Palin. He didn't reference her\".</p> <p>McCain himself used it last autumn, comparing Hillary Clinton's healthcare proposal to that which she developed while first lady.</p> <p>Other politicians have used the phrase to denigrate everything from an abortion rights bill to efforts to reform the US healthcare system.</p> <p>Here are some other instances of the colourful American idiom:<br>Senator Tom Harkin, speaking in 1991 about president George Bush Sr's plan to send military aid to the El Salvador army, said, \"To suggest they are guardians of liberty because they have committed fewer human rights violations in the latter half of 1990 is like putting lipstick on a pig - you've dressed it up a bit but you haven't changed the nature of the beast\".</p> <p>Former Democratic Texas governor Ann Richards, speaking of the same President Bush's 1992 call for the Democratic Congress to move on a constitutional amendment to force the government to keep a balanced budget, said, \"You can put lipstick on a pig and call it Monique, but it's still a pig.\"</p> <p>Anti-abortion lobbyist Doug Johnson in 1992 used the phrase to describe efforts to attach minor restrictions on abortions to a bill that would explicitly affirm abortion rights. He said the amendments would make the bill, which he opposed, more palatable and facilitate its passage. \"You don't want to put lipstick on a pig,\" Johnson said.</p> <p>For Republican senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, one of the most conservative members of the Senate until his defeat in 2006, legislative reforms to government subsidies for southern peanut and sugar farmers were the lipstick. The pig was the subsidy programme itself.</p> <p>In 1998, Republican Ohio congressman John Boehner used the phrase to describe what he said was a rudderless Republican congress that had suffered losses in that year's election.</p> <p>\"When there's no agenda and there's no real direction, what happens is you can't - you really can't have a message,\" he said. \"You can put lipstick on a pig all day long, but it's still a pig.\"</p>",
  "<p>American voters are driven to the polls by issues ranging from lagging house prices to the war in Iraq. But how many are angry about a $239,000 cheque to teach Girl Scouts math and science and $1.6m to study a disease afflicting grapevines? </p> <p>One of the central themes of Republican presidential nominee John McCain's campaign is his crusade against so-called \"pork barrel\" spending, a practice by which legislators secure federal funding for projects in their home districts by attaching relatively small items to the legislation that allocates the federal budget.</p> <p>McCain describes the practice of earmarking, as it is formally known in the legislative process, as verging on corrupt, and sees it as wasteful spending by legislators who are profligate with taxpayer money. </p> <p>Among his favourite examples: A $223m \"bridge to nowhere\" linking a sparsely-populated island in Alaska, his running mate Sarah Palin's home state, and a $4.8m project to study bears in Montana. </p> <p>McCain pledges that if he is elected president, he will end the practice and bring notoriety to the 97 senators and more than 95% of the 435 members of the House of Representatives who bring federal money back to their districts. </p> <p>\"I'll take this old ink pen and every single pork barrel earmark bill that comes across my desk as president, I will veto it,\" McCain said at a campaign rally in Ohio yesterday. \"I will make them famous and you will know their names. You will know their names.\"</p> <p>Projects not mentioned by McCain include $6.4m to digitise FBI investigative files, $22m for a mess hall for soldiers in Montana, and $81,000 for construction and renovation of a hospital in Utah. Legislators have allocated $5.7bn for transportation infrastructure needs.</p> <p>In all, the categories of earmarks McCain is keen on eliminating total about $30bn, or roughly one percent of the federal budget.</p> <p>\"People think that there's a good deal of waste in the federal government, and they would like to see somebody do something about it,\" said Scott Lilly, former Democratic staff director of the congressional committee that oversees federal budgeting and now a senior fellow at the Centre for American Progress, a liberal research group. </p> <p>\"But the fact is that, the vast majority of these things that he called earmarks are not particularly wasteful\".</p> <p>McCain's crusade again congressional earmarks excites Republican activists who would curtail the federal budget. But McCain is the first presidential candidate to make the topic a central campaign theme, and it is unclear how the theme will play with voters as the US economy plunges headlong into an economic downturn, making local governments more dependent than ever on federal largess.</p> <p>\"The earmark issue riles most voters as wasteful government spending and a corruption of the process,\" said Thomas Mann, a political scientist at the Brookings Institution, a think tank. </p> <p>\"But voters have little understanding of how trivial the sums involved are, relative to overall spending and the size of the deficit. Nonetheless, promises to abolish earmarks are no substitute for a real economic policy that might actually have some effect on a sick economy and on the well-being of those harmed by economic forces.\"</p> <p>Some political observers say that McCain's aggressive talk on the earmark spending is a proxy for his anti-Washington campaign and his pledge to shake up the nation's capital and change its ways, even while he has been in Congress for 26 years.</p> <p>McCain and running mate Palin \"define Washington as filed with people who enjoy spending other people's money\", said Norm Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organisation. </p> <p>\"So if you're trying to appear to be the anti-Washington, outside maverick who will bring change, this is a good pithy way of promoting it.\"</p> <p>Robin Kolodny, a political scientist at Temple University in Philadelphia, said McCain's cry on earmarks allows him to sound in control of the federal budget when his chief selling points to voters are his military background and his reputation as an independent operator, not his command of the economy.</p> <p>\"He's already exposed himself as being fuzzy on the details of the economy, so all he's trying to do is to say 'I've got a plan and I think we can make this all work if we just cut out some of these wasteful projects',\" she said.</p> <p>Lilly of the Centre for American Progress said McCain's talk on earmarks largely flies over the head of many voters, who are not sophisticated about the way the federal budget works.</p> <p>\"A lot of people don't quite get what he's talking about,\" he said. \"The term 'earmarks' is not something that is in the lexicon of the majority of voters.\"</p> <p>Most members of Congress and doubtless many voters see earmarks, or at least those in their areas, not as waste but as a benefit.</p> <p>\"'Pork' is spending in your district, not in mine,\" said Ornstein, quipping on the derisive term for the practice.</p>",
  "<p>I know the last thing we need right now is another North American election to worry about. Just as the coverage of the US election reaches saturation point in Europe, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7602864.stm\">announced</a> that Canada will go to the polls on October 14, in an attempt by Harper to increase the ruling conservative party's position to a majority government. And we should be worried.</p> <p>The US election obviously matters to Europeans - the last eight years have shown us how much of a stake the rest of us have in who America chooses as its next leader on November 4. What we might forget, in the next two months of North American election campaigning, is how much the Canadian election matters too.</p> <p>The lack of interest abroad in Canada's national politics is striking - probably partly a perennial stereotype of Canada as peaceful (read: boring) country, partly because the last eight years have required a heightened focus on the big bag of crazy that the institutional politics of Canada's southern neighbour has become. No one has benefited from this more than <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/harper_stephen/\">Harper</a>: outside of Canada, there's barely been a mention of the fact that even calling this election is a violation of his earlier electoral promise to set fixed election dates, to stop politicians calling elections whenever they're in a favourable position in the polls (can you guess why Harper called the election now?).</p> <p>In Britain we seem to be inured to how bizarre and undemocratic it is for leaders to be able to pick an election date. Harper's outright flip-flopping on the issue makes the whole problem transparent - and, sure enough, the likely outcome of the October election will be a majority Conservative government in Canada.</p> <p>The broken pledge on fixed elections is just the latest dubious act from Harper, a man who has dismissed the Kyoto Protocol as a <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/01/30/harper-kyoto.html\">\"socialist\" enterprise</a> with no purpose other than to punish rich nations, acquiesced to George Bush's war on terror, culled funding for <a href=\"http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061004/tories_women_061004/20061004?hub=Politics\">women's advocacy programmes</a> and accepted same-sex marriages only after members of his own party <a href=\"http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061207/samesexmarriage_vote_061207/20061207?hub=TopStories\">voted against him</a> on a motion to \"restore the traditional definition of marriage\". For a prime minister with a powerless minority government, he's managed to do an almost impressive amount of damage since coming to power two years ago, damage that - particularly on environmental issues - has an impact far beyond Canada.</p> <p>Some have argued that, even if you don't like Harper, a majority government of any kind is better than the current gridlock. Others have argued that it doesn't matter - that, being \"right or left wing in Canadian politics has come to mean as little as being left- or right-handed for a tennis serve\", that the main parties <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20060206_121010_121010\">compete for the centre</a>. But this ignores how odious Harper could be when no longer reined in by his enfeebled parliamentary position.</p> <p>If you care about the American election because you're scared of Sarah Palin's scepticism toward global warming, you should worry about Harper's unwillingness to continue his predecessor's work against climate change. If you hated George Bush because of his government's corrosion of civil liberties at home and abroad, the fact that Harper has been a thorough Bush apologist is a worrying indicator of how a full-fledged Conservative government would encroach on the rights of Canadians.</p> <p>Although Harper's agenda in the event of a majority government is still unclear, his record is a worrying indicator of the way things will go: to the list of anti-gay rights, anti-women and anti-environmental positions, we can add legislative changes giving Canada's immigration department unprecedented powers to reject immigration applications, as well as setting back truly universal childcare plans in favour of <a href=\"http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060502/budget_childcare_060502?s_name=&amp;no_ads=\">childcare \"allowances\"</a>. His foreign policy record is more of a question mark, but during the minority government Harper extended the pledge of Canada's troops in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2011. If John McCain is elected after Harper wins a majority, and decides another Middle Eastern country is looking at him the wrong way, is there enough in Harper's record to reassure us that he wouldn't bring Canada into an American-led invasion?</p> <p>So, with so much potentially at stake, why are we so uninterested in Canada's politics? Admittedly, even if Canada elected Conrad Black himself it would never be able to drag Britain into an illegal war - but is the fact that America has such an obvious impact on our lives the only reason we cover American politics so extensively in Europe? Is that really the reason the media here covers hurricanes only when they effect the US? The reason people watch The Wire? Surely Britons would at least claim we care about American politics because we also care about the lives of ordinary Americans, in and of themselves, and Barack Obama's and John McCain's domestic policies are reported extensively here. We're more concerned, obviously, with whether the next US president will invade another country than improve the domestic literacy rate, but we care about the US literacy rate too.<br> But even Canada's foreign policy, never mind its literacy rate, is largely ignored by the European media. Even before and beyond Harper, Canada's role in the war on terror has barely been scrutinised abroad - perhaps in part because its politics inconveniently ruptures neat periodisation. While 2001-2007 meant, for us, George Bush and Tony Blair, Canadians have gone through three prime ministers in this time.</p> <p>But it's perhaps due more to the way the rest of us buy wholesale into Canada's carefully crafted self-identity as the good-guys. After 9/11, Canada's good-guy image and the perceived rightness of the Afghanistan war were implicitly mutually reinforcing. Canada is a famously peaceful nation so, the implied reasoning went, the war in Afghanistan must be just because the mission was led by the nation of progressive liberals (even after 2006, when Canada elected Harper, they did this mainly because the Liberal party was eating itself while the Bloc Quebecois split the opposition votes. Canada's heart is still, generally, liberal). It often feels that Canada isn't treated as a nation so much as a totem, a moral barometer for western liberals elsewhere. Another mutually reinforcing binary: the not-Americans; the good-guys.</p> <p>This lazy equation was ruptured in the early 2000s, while progressives were too busy blaming America for all the world's evils to notice the complicity of the good-guys to the north. The incarceration and torture of Canadian citizen <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.ca/human_rights_issues/maher_arar_overview.php\">Maher Arar</a> at the hands of US authorities, and the Guant\u00e1namo detention of the Canadian minor <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/khadr/omar-khadr.html\">Omar Khadr</a>, were met with silence by the Liberals in Ottawa - the supposed good-guys in a nation of good-guys.</p> <p>The point here is not to paint Canada's response to the new realities of the 2000s as on par with Britain's or America's actions in these years. Of course there's an element truth at the heart of the crafted myth of Canada's liberal identity. I wouldn't have moved there for a year if there weren't. And of course it can feel difficult, as a British person opposed to the Iraq war, to criticise a country that had the strength not to be dragged into it.</p> <p>But, with all respect for that, perhaps it's time to recognise how the assumption that Canada is a problem-free good-guy nation is not only patronising to those who live there with far from problem-free lives \u2013 but also leaves, until we begin to unpick this assumption, a missing piece in our understanding of how the last seven years were allowed to happen.<br> If Obama wins the election less than a month after the Canadian election, the almost-unthinkable will happen: for the first time in generations, Canada will have a government that is more conservative than its southern neighbour. And perhaps that's what will restore America's reputation in Europe more than all the promises of hope and change: the day <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6666338/\">Canadian tourists put American flags</a> on their backpacks so that you'll treat them nicely.</p>",
  "<p>General Ray Odierno, the former second-in-command of US troops in Iraq, is to return to Baghdad next week to take over from General David Petraeus as the top general.</p> <p>Odierno, who will be promoted to four-star general, was a relative latecomer to the hearts and minds counterinsurgency techniques of Petraeus.</p> <p>During his first stint in Iraq, when he commanded the 4th Infantry Division in 2003, Odierno was responsible for an area north of Baghdad known as the Sunni triangle, which included Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's home town. </p> <p>Few US military commanders or soldiers have much good to say about Odierno's aggressive tactics. His division's mistreatment of Iraqis and the heavy use of artillery appalled others within the country's armed forces. </p> <p>Army reporters and commanders said Odierno's unit - a heavy armoured division, despite its name \u2013 used an iron-fist strategy that may have appeared to pacify the area in the short term, but alienated large parts of the population. Some argue that the behaviour of the 4th Infantry Division helped create the insurgency.</p> <p>\"Fourth ID fuelled the insurgency,\" an army psychological operations officer told Thomas Ricks in his book on the Iraq war, Fiasco. An unnamed general said bluntly: \"The 4th ID \u2013 what they did was a crime.\"</p> <p>Odierno has defended his troops' conduct by saying his men faced a population more hostile than in the rest of Iraq and had to act accordingly. The capture by Saddam in an underground bunker in December 2003 by Odierno's soldiers did little to dispel their cowboy image. </p> <p>The division's tactics contrasted with those of Petraeus, whose troops complemented searches of ex-Baathists' homes with meetings with tribal chiefs and community projects such as rebuilding schools and painting over old murals of Saddam Hussein. Petraeus went on to <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-24.pdf\">rewrite the US military's counterinsurgency manual (pdf)</a> and then took overall command in Iraq.</p> <p>Odierno, who finished a 15-month stint as the second in charge in February, was slow in recognising the strength of the insurgency at the start of 2004. At the time, he told reporters that the insurgents had been \"brought to their knees\". He was not alone in his overconfidence. A few months later, violence erupted and US forces all but ceded control of places such as Fallujah to the rebels.</p> <p>Later in 2004, the war took a brutally personal twist for Odierno. His son, Tony, an army lieutenant at the time, lost an arm to a rocket-propelled grenade. A West Point graduate, the younger Odierno left the army and went to graduate school in New York.</p> <p>For the older Odierno, Iraq was unfinished business. He returned in late 2006 and redeemed himself by recognising the failings of the US strategy at the time, recommending more troops at a time when the White House was under enormous political pressure to withdraw forces. </p> <p>\"His recommendations for what came to be known as the surge forces have since been proven correct,\" Petraeus said at a ceremony in Baghdad marking the end of Odierno's last tour in February.</p> <p>Odierno seems to have adopted the Petraeus approach, telling troops that it is their job to protect the population and that counter-insurgency takes time. </p> <p>When he takes up his new post he will answer to Petraeus, who will take over in late October as chief of US central command, which oversees US military involvement in the Middle East, Afghanistan and the rest of central Asia. Odierno and Petraeus know each other well: for the final 12 months of Odierno's time in Baghdad his immediate superior was Petraeus.</p> <p>Odierno will be taking over at a time of relative calm. The surge has contributed to a big drop in sectarian violence and the newly confident Iraqi prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, is keen to see the withdrawal of all US combat troops by 2010, although he will probably have to settle for a compromise of 2011.</p> <p>George Bush yesterday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/10/iraq.usa\">announced a withdrawal of 8,000 US combat troops by February</a>, but that would still leave his successor with about 140,000 troops \u2013 roughly the same as the pre-surge levels of last February. It will be Odierno's job to ensure that the gains of the past year are not reversed and to set the stage for an eventual US withdrawal.</p> <p>Odierno's margin for manoeuvre could depend not only what happens on the ground, but on who wins the US presidential race. He favours a \"conditions-based\" approach to judging US troop requirements in Iraq, taking into account levels of violence, the strength of insurgent groups and changes in the quality and numbers of Iraqi government troops. John McCain, the Republican candidate, backs such an approach, whereas Barack Obama, the Democratic candidate, wants a firm timetable.</p>",
  "<p>Remember Barack Obama? Time was, you couldn't turn on the television or open a newspaper without seeing our next president - for that was how we thought of him, in those days. But lately the man with the striped ties and the big ears has been more difficult to find in the American mediascape. On Sunday, Obama gave a wide-ranging interview to one of the morning talkshows, in which he offered a thoughtful, complex assessment of the Iraq surge and discussed how rising unemployment and the Fannie-Freddie bailout might change his economic plans. What crumb did the wire services seize upon? <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jrl9ahfdY9qXe3MTAmvwVVuCIVUA\">A throwaway line about basketball</a>: \"Obama offers Palin a game of hoops.\"</p> <p>John McCain's running mate might be avoiding the press, but Sarah Palin is everywhere - on the covers of Time and Newsweek, not to mention People and Us Weekly. You'd be forgiven if you thought that the woman was running for president herself. A good fraction of the coverage has been harsh, yes. But it has also been frustratingly distracted. The idiotic rumours that her (now pregnant) daughter is the true mother of child No 5 were unworthy of a telenovela, but that didn't stop the New York Times from putting <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/08/us/politics/08baby.html\">four different reporters </a>on the case. Her string of alleged abuses of power, her rejection of the realities of climate change, her <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/227/story/51940.html\">apparent ignorance</a> of the basics of the mortgage market: these are stories worth covering, and they've got a bit of play. But they've been drowned out by the dumber stories about her hair or her family, and by the Republican chorus that the media have it in for her.</p> <p>\"Shame on you!\" they shouted in unison, like Puritans around a ducking stool, as Palin scolded the media during her speech last Wednesday in St Paul. It's ironic, to say the least, that the GOP has decided to hit the press in order to win an election for McCain, a man who has enjoyed <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/id/114548\">the media's adulation</a> for 25 years and who used to call reporters \"my base\". But the stratagem is plain: discredit the messenger, and reports on Palin's serious ethics problems or shoddy record can be written off as baseless (and sexist) attacks by a group with a vendetta, hell-bent on destroying an unimpeachable hockey mom who shares your values. Unlike that other guy. </p> <p>In its malign simplicity, the beat-the-press theme bears the mark of Steve Schmidt, the Karl Rove acolyte who has imposed an impressive unity on the once-errant McCain campaign. For him, reporters are on <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/02/AR2008090203144.html\">\"a mission to destroy\"</a> their VP candidate, hopelessly infatuated with Obama and not to be trusted. But demonising the media and keeping the running mate under a form of house arrest are not winning tactics. Indeed, like the Palin pick itself, the media bashing does little more than excite the base.</p> <p>For despite the hysteria of a few lefties who seem never to have heard of a convention bounce, Palin has not instantly won the hearts of millions of undecided voters in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. On the contrary, outside the base <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/08/uselections2008.iraq\">she hasn't played very well</a> \u2013 and she has nowhere to go but down. The McCain campaign understands that inevitability. Palin's sequestration is testament to the fact that she cannot withstand the scrutiny that the press (though not, apparently, McCain's vetting process) demands. And the campaign's legal actions in Alaska, where it's doing its best to block any embarrassing new revelations surrounding her firing of her public safety commissioner, bespeak a real fear of an October surprise.</p> <p>It's a war against information. The McCain team knows that if the media do their job and give Palin the same scrutiny that any candidate for high office must endure, she will collapse. Whether that will happen, or whether the press will be cowed by the GOP into doubting its own raison d'\u00eatre, remains to be seen. Palin will emerge from her televisual purdah at the end of this week, when she'll face Charles Gibson, the ABC anchor who has not won much praise lately for hard-hitting journalism. The Clinton-Obama debate that he moderated (along with George Stephanopoulos) set new standards for vacuity, with nearly an hour devoted to such non-topics as the iconology of flag lapel pins. <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2008/04/28/080428taco_talk_hertzberg\">Rick Hertzberg</a>, the indispensable analyst at the New Yorker, called it \"something akin to a federal crime\".</p> <p>Here's hoping that Gibson asks Palin a few questions about her record - and also a few about instability in Pakistan or how to increase liquidity in credit markets. But don't get your hopes up. Bizarrely, Gibson will interview Palin over the course of a few days, meaning that if the questioning turns in a direction the campaign doesn't like, later sessions can be cancelled. If he fluffs it, we may have to wait all the way until the vice-presidential debate on October 8 to put real questions to the woman who might one day be president.</p>",

  "<p>In 2002 and 2003, the Bush administration knew something about the media that the media still don't fully understand about themselves. If you're in a position of power and you want to say something, just say it, no matter what, and the media will repeat it and repeat it.</p> <p>Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction to speak of? No matter. Just say he did. He wasn't six months away from nuclear capability? So what\u2014just assert that he was. He wasn't tied to 9-11, there was no famous Prague meeting? No problem. Suggest there might have been. Muddy it up. Good enough.</p> <p>Bush and co. knew that the media are constitutionally unequipped to call a lie a lie. People in the media like to flatter themselves as truth-tellers and the people's watchdogs and all that, but the fact is that except in very rare circumstances, there's no such thing as \"objective truth\" in the media, particularly the political media. There's just what one side says and what the other side says. This is especially so on cable television.</p> <p>The Bush people manipulated this. But the McCain campaign has taken it to extremes that make even Dick Cheney look like a wallflower. The number and intensity of outright lies, even for jaded observers, is just staggering.</p> <p>There's Sarah Palin's lies about the bridge and earmarks. There's an unbelievable one I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/09/johnmccain.usforeignpolicy\">mentioned yesterday</a> about Obama's alleged opposition to combat systems. There's the <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/a_new_stitch_in_a_bad_pattern.html\">flatly false assertion</a> to middle-class audiences that Obama will raise their taxes, even though his tax plan does no such thing. </p> <p>Now there's this incredible McCain education ad that tries to argue that Obama wants to pervert kindergartners. The legislation, in Illinois, was in fact designed to allow local school boards to teach \"age appropriate\" sex education \u2013 and to teach children about how to identify sexual predators! </p> <p>And then there's this silly pig-lipstick business, which I wouldn't even dignify by mentioning except that, obvious as it was that Obama was talking about McCain and not Palin, the McCain camp has now created something called the \"Palin Truth Squad\" that was formed to push the lie that Obama was talking about Palin. I'll say that again: a \"truth squad\" created for the express purpose of pushing a lie.</p> <p>And where is the truth squad of the press, the people's watchdogs? Mostly enjoying the show, hyping the \"mudslinging\" between the two sides, which of course \"both sides\" are guilty of. Nonsense. Obama and Biden distort certain things about McCain's record \u2013 that whole 100 years in Iraq business is a stretch. But McCain did say it, so it's only a stretch, not a fabrication.</p> <p>McCain and Palin are engaged in serial total fabrications. And almost no one calls them on it. The New York Times, which found the space to run a puffy piece on Palin's family on its front page the other day, hasn't found similar space to run a story under a headline like, \"McCain-Palin Claims Stretch Credulity, Some Say.\" </p> <p>CBS and CNN have finally gotten around to <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/09/eveningnews/main4433129.shtml?source=mostpop_story\">running </a><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/09/palin.earmarks/\">reports </a>that pretty much state outright that Palin is lying about the bridge. ABC's Jake Tapper <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/09/a-piggish-debat.html\">plainly called out</a> the \"truth squad\" on the lipstick story. McClatchy did <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/staff/margaret_talev/story/52169.html\">a strong fact-check</a> of the McCain education ad. But for the most part, the media treats it all as entertainment, a matter of which side has seized the offensive. </p> <p>The McCain team knows all this. So they consciously promote lies, knowing that no real mechanism exists to stop them from doing so. </p> <p>The Obama team should have been doing a stronger job of push-back these last few days. It was only after Obama himself said Palin was lying about the bridge that a few media outlets started pursuing that angle. That's how the game is played, and the McCain strategy will be a test of their ability to hit back fast and hard. </p> <p>But this race is now a test of the media too. You'd think after being told in the run-up to the Iraq war a bushel of things that didn't end up being true that they printed anyway, they'd have given some thought to the question of how not to let themselves be manipulated like that again. But it is happening again, and the media are getting played in exactly the same way.</p> <p>And what does all this say about John McCain? In 2000, when he was running against George Bush in the South Carolina primary, he was smeared by outright lies charging among other things that he'd fathered an out-of-wedlock black child. The man who \"directed communications\" for Bush's 2000 South Carolina effort was Tucker Eskew. McCain confidants have long held Eskew partly responsible for those smears. </p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/02/mccain-hires-gop-operativ_n_123152.html\">McCain hired him</a>, to staff up Palin. That just about says all we need to know about today's McCain. </p> <p>Now let me ask you. What is more revealing of a candidate's \"character\": The fact that a candidate used a phrase as old as the hills, a phrase the other candidate himself has used (see Jake Tapper above), or the fact that a candidate would hire someone he once regarded as having helped spread vile innuendo about him and his family?</p> <p>Deeper and deeper we go into the hall of mirrors\u2026</p>",

  "<p>David Cameron has marched on to traditional Labour territory by declaring that the Conservatives are now Britain's \"true champions for progressive ideals\". Tackling poverty, protecting the environment and kickstarting social mobility would be key goals in his first years in office. A Conservative government would adopt a fresh approach as central government is cut back, giving charities and voluntary groups an important role in delivering Cameron's three priorities: school reform, welfare reform and strengthening families. \"This is not going to be about the usual mechanisms of government,\" one member of the Cameron circle says. \"It is a completely new approach that the political world has not got a handle on.\" The Guardian today explains the new Tory thinking in 10 policy areas. Richard Reeves, director of Demos, then assesses whether Cameron can deliver \"progressive goals through Conservative means\". Demos is an independent thinktank which influenced Tony Blair and provided many of the policy ideas for New Labour. Recently it has been working with the Tories on seminars on the \"post-bureaucratic age\", one of Cameron's big themes. Reeves says that the Conservative march into progressive territory \"is not merely rhetorical\". Some policies score well, such as education and the environment. But he says the Tories remain \"too sceptical about the progressive potential of the state\" and are backward-looking on marriage and law and order\". And his conclusion? Overall, \"they are making progress\"</p> <h2>1. Economy</h2> <p>The Conservatives plan an evolutionary rather than revolutionary economic policy, having ruled out promises of unfunded tax cuts which have got them into so much trouble at previous elections. Given that the public finances are so deep in the red, they would have little room to cut taxes at all.</p> <p>But their long-standing promise is to \"share the proceeds of growth\" - in other words, to let public spending grow more slowly than the economy over time, thereby allowing them to cut taxes or reduce borrowing over the medium term. They have pledged to match Labour's planned 2% annual spending growth until 2011; they say there will be no \"blank cheque\" after that.</p> <p>Spending levels would be ringfenced until 2011 in health, education and international development. Spending on other departments could change, though the overall spending envelope would remain the same.</p> <p>Tax cuts would have to be fiscally neutral, at least in the first years in government. Many of these would be paid from a \"family fund\" to be financed mainly by green taxes, though they admit that opposition to these taxes is growing.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Abolish stamp duty for first-time buyers purchasing homes up to \u00a3250,000</p> <p>\u00b7 Increase the inheritance tax threshold to \u00a31m a person, \u00a32m a couple</p> <p>\u00b7 Impose a \u00a325,000 levy on non-doms, generating \u00a32.8bn, to pay for stamp duty and IHT cuts</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>2/5</p> <p>The short-term commitment to Labour spending plans is a break with the traditional tax-cutting agenda. And hitting non-doms was a long-overdue progressive goal. But on tax there is little to cheer: abolishing stamp duty helps those in the middle and the inheritance tax cuts is a boon for those at the top</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.economy\">Read more: economic policy</a></p> <h2>2. Welfare reform</h2> <p>The Conservatives are promising a \"full-bloodied version\" of what they call the government's \"half-hearted\" implementation of a radical report on welfare reform by the city financier David Freud. This calls for a greater role for the voluntary and private sector, who will be paid by results. They promise a two-pronged approach: tough new regulations from the centre coupled with a greater \"bottom-up\" approach for the voluntary and private sector.</p> <p>Tax credits, criticised by the Conservatives for masking rather than tackling the root causes of poverty, will be retained. But the Tories would aim to make them a less prominent tool in tackling poverty by improving people's skills as well, so they can secure better jobs and be less reliant on the state.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Tougher assessments for benefit claimants, notably the 2.6 million people claiming incapacity benefit as a result of illness or disability. All recipients of IB, excluding disabled people who cannot work, will undergo a \"work capability assessment\"</p> <p>\u00b7 People who refuse to join a return to work programme will lose the right to claim jobless benefits until they do</p> <p>\u00b7 The changes will be funded by a greater \"payment by results\" programme in which the voluntary and private sector will be paid when they succeed in returning people to work, and in keeping them there for two years</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>2/5</p> <p>There is nothing progressive about leaving people in a state of long-term welfare dependency: independence is a key goal. Toughening up the conditions attached to benefits will be progressive if accompanied by measures to improve employability: bringing in non-state providers may help to achieve this so long as sufficient investment is made </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.welfare\">Read more: welfare policy</a></p> <h2>3. Family</h2> <p>Family breakdown lies at the heart of Britain's \"broken society\", according to David Cameron, who will recognise marriage and civil partnerships through the tax and benefit system.</p> <p>The shadow chancellor, George Osborne, told the Guardian this week that marriage was the best environment in which to raise children.</p> <p>Cameron will also introduce measures to make Britain more \"family-friendly\". A key proposal is a health visitor for all mothers of newborn babies, to be paid from the budget for \"outreach workers\" in the Sure Start programme.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 End the \"couple penalty\" in the benefit system which means, according to the Tories, that people are encouraged to live apart</p> <p>\u00b7 All parents to be offered 12 months' parental leave, to be shared by mother and father</p> <p>\u00b7 Universal health visiting service to all mothers of newborn babies. This will include a minimum guarantee of two visits in the home for all mothers in the later stages of pregnancy, six hours of support in the first two weeks after birth, with a series of staggered visits leading to two visits a year for all one- to five-year-olds</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>3/5</p> <p>The Conservatives have set the pace on \"family friendly policies\" such as parental leave and are willing to invest in the critical early months after having children; more support for carers and fathers should be the next steps. But the tax break for marriage is a nostalgic irrelevance</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.family.policy\">Read more: family policy</a></p> <h2>4. Health</h2> <p>The Tories believe that Alan Milburn, Labour's most radical health secretary, will look on with envy as they introduce what they describe as a true NHS marketplace, free at the point of delivery and funded out of central taxation.</p> <p>Milburn wanted all NHS hospitals in England to have the opportunity to become independent foundation trusts by 2008, competing with each other for patients and free to borrow to fund investment. But just over half the NHS trusts remain under Whitehall control because they cannot yet pass a fitness test showing they are ready for independence. The Tories want an independent NHS board to direct the commissioning of healthcare, deciding what level of service can be afforded within the budget set by parliament. It would not run NHS hospitals or GP surgeries.</p> <p>A Conservative government would not set \"targets\", such as reduced waiting times. But it would demand certain \"outcomes\", such as an increased survival rate from cancer, which would be published.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong> </p> <p>\u00b7 Phasing out \"process-driven targets\", to measure \"outcomes\" instead</p> <p>\u00b7 Giving patients a choice of provider so they can use published information to decide what care they receive</p> <p>\u00b7 Introduce \"payment-by-results\" to reward hospitals and doctors that achieve high standards</p> <p>\u00b7 Rename health secretary as public health secretary</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>2/5</p> <p>Giving patients more power is a highly progressive goal. More competition should drive up standards. Greater autonomy for professionals may boost productivity. But without clear targets the danger of a \"postcode lottery\" will rise. The party's support for \"local\" GPs betrays their own conservatism on the institutional structure of healthcare</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.health\">Read more: health policy</a></p> <h2>5. Education/skills</h2> <p>A key ambition in public services - to pick up the \"baton of reform\" left by Tony Blair - applies strongly in education.</p> <p>Greater freedom would be granted to academies because the Conservatives believe the government has given local education authorities too great a say.</p> <p>A \"supply-side revolution\" to provide more than 220,000 new school places would have at its heart a Swedish-style system of not-for-profit \"free\" schools, run by charities, community groups and faith leaders working along the lines of academies. Working within the state sector, they would have access to equivalent levels of fund per pupil that is given to existing state schools.</p> <p>Spending would be increased on pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, with a premium added to the \"per pupil\" funding formula.</p> <p>The Tories would change the vocational training system to make it easier for employers to give apprenticeships, which would in turn be more responsive to the demands of the job market.</p> <p>They would redirect the current \u00a31.3bn skills budget, with \u00a3775m going directly on apprenticeships.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 New laws to improve headteachers' powers to curb poor behaviour by scrapping pupil appeal panels which assess pupils' complaints when they feel they have been unfairly excluded</p> <p>\u00b7 Ensure that every child that is capable of doing so is reading by the age of six</p> <p>\u00b7 Reform schools inspection regime to ensure \"more searching scrutiny of under-performance\"</p> <p>\u00b7 Lead a \"demand-led training revolution\" by abolishing the Learning and Skills Council and creating \"lifelong learning accounts\" to allow people to spend an allocation of money on training</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>4/5</p> <p>The \"academisation\" of British education is largely to be welcomed, and the Conservatives are in the lead. Extra resources targeted at the poorest pupils, greater autonomy for school leaders, and more choice for parents: all good news. What's missing is a distinct strategy on pre-school education</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.education\">Read more: education policy</a></p> <h2>6. Law and order</h2> <p>Dominic Grieve, the shadow home secretary, will adopt a tough and tender approach. As an advocate of civil liberties, Grieve would need persuading as home secretary to abandon his campaign against the pre-charge detention of terror suspects for up to 42 days. ID cards would also be abolished.</p> <p>In other areas, he would adopt a tough stance. Grieve would amend the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act so that police no longer need to secure authorisation to conduct surveillance on those suspected of non-terrorist offences.</p> <p>The Tories would accept the government's points-based system on immigration. But they would toughen it by imposing an annual limit on immigration from outside the EU.</p> <p>Prisons would provide a testbed for some of the Tories' most radical \"bottom- up\" ideas. Private companies and voluntary groups would be hired - on a \"payment by results\" basis - to steer inmates away from a life of crime in an attempt to cut re-offending rates, which account for a high proportion of crime.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Border police force to \"secure Britain's borders\"</p> <p>\u00b7 Directly elected police commissioners to replace police authorities</p> <p>\u00b7 Increase prison capacity by 5,000 over Labour's plans</p> <p>\u00b7 Replace automatic release for prisoners with earned release</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>2/5</p> <p>Abandoning the 42 day pre-charge detention and scrapping ID cards may win over the hearts of Islington liberals: but in terms of overall policy the Tories need to focus less on policing and prisons and more on the \"causes of crime\". They claim to be anti-state, but rely on it much too heavily here</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.justice\">Read more: law and order policy</a></p> <h2>7. Environment</h2> <p>The battle against climate change was one of Cameron's early themes when he sought to \"decontaminate\" the Conservative brand. In recent months he has faced criticism for downgrading the environment.</p> <p>Cameron sought to restore the balance in June when he said the world could not afford to abandon the environment, even in an economic downturn. A Tory government would adopt \"realistic environmentalism\" that would have four core elements: green taxes to encourage good behaviour; stringent rules to encourage greener cars; a framework to encourage greener energy; and \"nudge\" ideas, such as listing how much energy people use on their fuel bills, to encourage energy efficiency.</p> <p>Tories say they will take a major step later this year when they launch what is being dubbed as the \"first coherent UK strategy for transforming Britain into a low carbon economy\". This is expected to offer stronger support for nuclear power.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Average emissions for new cars down to 100 grams per km by 2030</p> <p>\u00b7 Green taxes, which would not apply retrospectively, would go into a \"family fund\" to finance tax relief for families</p> <p>\u00b7 Replace climate change levy, a tax on energy, with carbon levy to distinguish between high and low carbon production</p> <p>\u00b7 Use money from EU emissions trading scheme to fund at least three carbon capture and storage demonstration projects</p> <p>\u00b7 Ensure that carbon emissions rate generated in new power stations cannot be higher than amount generated in modern gas-fired power stations</p> <p>\u00b7 Creation of \"feed-in tariffs\" with people paid for energy produced from, for example, solar panels</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>4/5</p> <p>The Conservatives have gone green, ticking boxes on micro-generation, carbon pricing, emissions standards and - maybe - the third Heathrow runway. Ring-fencing proceeds from green taxes for families is smart. But they have not paid enough attention to the impact of expensive carbon on poorer families - and look to be leaning too heavily on nuclear power</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.green.politics\">Read more: environment policy</a></p> <h2>8. Transport</h2> <p>Cameron says that gridlocked roads and slow, packed trains are neither good for business nor the environment. He would launch a feasibility study to introduce an expanded high speed train network, would tackle the worst bottlenecks and look at ways of giving parents an alternative to the school run to reduce congestion.</p> <p>The City of London has been worried that Cameron has tilted too far in favour of the environment. There was alarm in June when he appeared to rule out a third runway at Heathrow on the grounds that the government should try and make the airport \"better, not bigger\".</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Give \u00a3200m a year from the transport innovation fund to local authorities to encourage alternatives to car use</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>1/5</p> <p>Good rhetoric - non-existent policies. Another feasibility study on high-speed rail? There are countless initiatives already in place to discourage the school run. In transport you have to put your money where your mouth is: and the Conservatives have failed to make a single significant commitment likely to improve our transport infrastructure</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.transport\">Read more: transport policy</a></p> <h2>9. Local govt/housing</h2> <p>The Conservatives' new \"bottom-up\" approach will be tested in local government and housing as the party pledges a genuine devolution.</p> <p>Local government financing could be taken out of the hands of ministers who currently control the funding of 80% of council services. The overall level of funding would be decided centrally but the distribution would be set independently.</p> <p>The Tories say the government is setting unrealistic house building targets - 3m new homes by 2020. Instead of issuing central targets they will encourage local communities to accept new homes by introducing incentives.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Allow local authorities to retain a portion of local business rates</p> <p>\u00b7 Dismantle the \"bureaucratic quangocracy\" of regional assemblies and regional development agencies</p> <p>\u00b7 Remove council tax capping and instead hold local referendums to approve increases in council taxes \"more than the norm\"</p> <p>\u00b7 Encourage housebuilding by allowing local councils to keep the proceeds from council taxes paid by residents in newly built homes</p> <p>\u00b7 Scrap home information packs (Hips)</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>2/5</p> <p>Referendums in place of council tax capping is a bold democratic move, but will also test the strength of local polities. \"Bureaucratic quangocracies\" make for good political targets, but it is not clear what the Conservatives would do to support economic development in disadvantaged areas</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.local.government\">Read more: local government and housing policy</a></p> <h2>10. Foreign affairs</h2> <p>The Conservative approach to foreign affairs embodies the old and the new.</p> <p>On the new side, Cameron has pledged to meet the UN target on aid spending.</p> <p>On the old side, Cameron would be Britain's most Eurosceptic prime minister. His plan to reverse Britain's ratification of the Lisbon treaty, if the measure has not entered EU law by the time of a British general election, would be opposed by virtually every EU leader.</p> <p>Cameron would have an easier ride with the transatlantic special relationship. He enjoys warm relations with John McCain and had a friendly meeting with Barack Obama in July.</p> <p>Describing himself as a liberal Conservative in a speech in Islamabad last week, Cameron sought to reshape Tony Blair's \"liberal interventionism\" when he said he was sceptical about \"grand utopian schemes to re-make the world according to a politician's timetable\". His visit to Pakistan and Afghanistan was designed to underline a key theme: that there is no longer a separation between foreign and domestic affairs. They come together under the heading of \"national security\", because what happens in Pakistan now has a direct bearing on Britain.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Meet UN target on aid spending - 0.7% of GNI - by 2013</p> <p>\u00b7 Create a national security council, to be headed by Lady Neville-Jones</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>3/5</p> <p>Europe remains the Conservatives' achilles heel in foreign affairs. Until Cameron gets Europe right his efforts to sketch a 21st century foreign policy will fail. But the Conservatives have developed a thoughtful approach to international development, especially on issues such as corruption and governance, aid effectiveness, and fragile states</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.foreign.policy\">Read more: foreign policy</a></p>",
  "<p>Ukraine's leaders, a heterogeneous bunch, are feeling miffed with the French. More ominously, so is the Brussels press corps. Not to mention the hotel proprietors and restaurateurs of Evian.</p> <p>The reason? Nicolas Sarkozy's globetrotting and how everyone else has to change their plans and adapt their schedules and credit cards to accommodate the restless French president.</p> <p>For months the Alpine spa had been preparing for a presidential shindig, with Sarko and his entourage arriving in Evian to host a European summit with Ukraine.</p> <p>The EU moves at a glacial pace, and the summit between Sarkozy, a bunch of Brussels bigwigs, and Viktor Yushchenko, Ukraine's perennially harassed president, would have been important for Kiev, while barely registering with the rest of us. Were it not for the Russians.</p> <p>You can depend on the Russians to rudely interrupt Europe's August slumber \u2013 coup attempts, financial meltdowns, submarine sinkings, tower block bombings, the kind of crises that ordinarily supply we mediafolks with headlines and emergencies when we should all be on our hols.</p> <p>This year, of course, it was Georgia. Since Ukraine is allied with Georgia in trying to escape Russia's orbit, is 10 times bigger, is home to millions of ethnic Russians whom the Kremlin has just declared it will protect and defend (elevating the pledge to a foundation of the new foreign policy outlined by president Dmitry Medvedev), Yushchenko is understandably jittery.</p> <p>His government has just collapsed (again). The country faces its sixth election in four years. Yushchenko accuses his prime minister, Yuliya Tymoshenko, of plotting with the Russians behind his back to unseat him and failing to support plucky little Georgia against the big bad Kremlin.</p> <p>The timing of this mess couldn't be worse, seemingly designed to reinforce the hostility of the Germans and the Dutch (for quite different reasons) to offering the Ukrainians anything but the faintest of support and blocking the merest hint that Ukraine might eventually join the EU.</p> <p>Sarkozy, like Brussels appropriating the right to pronounce on what is \"European\" and what is not, announced on Tuesday that Ukraine is a \"European country\".</p> <p>On the avenues, in the libraries and cathedrals of Kiev, among the Baroque and Hapsburgian splendours of Lviv, it is hard to imagine that Ukraine is anything else. African? American? Asian?</p> <p>Sarko's banality was supposed to be consolation, but was merely offensive. Ukraine won't be joining the EU anytime soon, but it is European.</p> <p>To add insult to injury, all this was taking place not in Evian on Tuesday, but in Paris. An army of ministers, bureaucrats, and diplomats had organised their travel and booked their hotel suites in Evian.</p> <p>But Sarkozy was busy. Immersed in hours of tense talks with Medvedev at a villa outside Moscow, grabbing his jacket and threatening to walk out when the Russians told him to stuff his plan to get them to withdraw some of their forces from Georgia.</p> <p>\"There's nothing to negotiate here. We can't accept the invasion of an independent country,\" Sarkozy is said to have told the Russians. Fair cop, Sarko, Medvedev is said to have responded. The Russians finally saw reason, courtesy of French arm-twisting, enabling Sarkozy to jet off to Tbilisi to sign up President Mikheil Saakashvili to the French peace deal.</p> <p>This is the French and Brussels version of events. The Russians, of course, who have created several facts on the ground in Georgia, saw Sarkozy and the Europeans coming, and got everything they wanted from the negotiations.</p> <p>The Ukrainians, meanwhile, were heading for Evian. The Brussels press corps, too, since there was now much more at stake in the EU-Ukraine summit than would have been the case had the Russians not invaded and carved up Georgia in a mere 140 hours.</p> <p>But Sarkozy did not get back from the Caucasus until 5 in the morning on Tuesday and was too fatigued to rush to the Alps. So the entire summit was transferred to Paris at the last minute, via an announcement by the AFP, the main French news agency.</p> <p>Flight tickets, hotel bookings, schedules and travel arrangements had to be quickly rejigged. A lot of money has been lost.</p> <p>The Ukrainians are quietly fuming. The press corps in Brussels is screaming foul play. Its association \"intends to write a letter of protest for the EU presidency mismanagement of this event\".<br></p>",
  "<p>John McCain doesn't seem too bothered by Gordon Brown's favourable comments about Barack Obama's housing policies. As <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/americano/2073576/the-mccain-campaign-mocks-gordon-brown.thtml\">Coffee House</a> has already spotted, the McCain campaign has posted <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/mccainreport/Read.aspx?guid=d7eb6c0b-d3c1-48b8-84cc-917f5faaa67f\">an elegant rebuttal on its website.</a></p> <blockquote> <p>Far be it from this campaign to underestimate the value of an endorsement from British prime minister Gordon Brown, but there is one slightly embarrassing detail that this endorsement is bound to highlight.</p> </blockquote> <p>The McCain website points out that the contentious \"endorsement\" in Brown's <a href=\"http://www.housemag.co.uk/index.php?id=315&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=8113&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=92&amp;type=editorial\">Monitor article</a> only relates to one Obama policy, his proposal for a foreclosure prevention fund. The writer goes on:</p> <blockquote> <p>Obama had championed a Foreclosure Prevention Fund, but sometime late last month he seems to have ... changed his position. According to Versionista, a program that allows us to track changes to the Obama website, Senator Obama quietly erased any mention of a Foreclosure Prevention Fund in late August. No new program was offered in its stead. Whether this will cause Prime Minister Brown to rethink his support for Senator Obama remains unclear, but perhaps it will cause the press to ask a few more questions of Senator Obama and his plans to magically solve the housing crisis through higher taxes.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.order-order.com/2008/09/gordon-openly-backs-obama-president.html\">Guido Fawkes</a> is as brutal as ever: \"Barring an act of God, the curse of Jonah Brown means Obama is now doomed...\"</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown today sought to defuse the row about his supposed endorsement of Barack Obama by lavishing praise on both US presidential candidates.</p> <p>At a press conference with the Italian prime minister this afternoon, Brown said that he had \"great admiration\" for Obama and his Republican rival, John McCain, and that both men were \"very distinguished senators\".</p> <p>He also insisted repeatedly that what happened in the US elections was \"a matter entirely for the American people\".</p> <p>Earlier, a Downing Street spokesman specifically denied that Brown was endorsing Obama in a magazine article in which the prime minister praised one of Obama's housing policies.</p> <p>Writing in the <a href=\"http://www.housemag.co.uk/index.php?id=315&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=8113&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=92&amp;type=editorial\">Parliamentary Monitor,</a> Brown said that the Democrats were the party in America who were developing ideas to help people through the current economic difficulties.</p> <p>He cited one of Obama's proposals to help families facing repossession. He did not mention the Republican candidate, John McCain.</p> <p>Brown was asked about the issue at his press conference this afternoon. In his response, he did not refer to the article directly, but he said that he had met McCain and Obama in Washington and in London and that he admired both of them.</p> <p>Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, said that it would be \"totally absurd\" for a European leader to express a preference for one or other candidate in the US elections.</p> <p>After the article appeared yesterday, a member of McCain's campaign team contacted the British embassy in Washington, DC, to express concern about the article.</p> <p>The shadow foreign secretary, William Hague, said that the prime minister should not do anything that suggested he was taking sides in the election, as he would have to work with whoever eventually won November's election. </p> <p>He called on Brown to explain why he \"appeared to be favouring the Democrats\".</p> <p>In his article, Brown said that around the world it was \"progressive\" politicians who were grappling with the challenges of rising food and oil prices and the changes wrought by globalisation.</p> <p>He added: \"In the electrifying US presidential campaign, it is the Democrats who are generating the ideas to help people through more difficult times.</p> <p>\"To help prevent people from losing their home, Barack Obama has proposed a foreclosure prevention fund to increase emergency pre-foreclosure counselling, and help families facing repossession.\"</p> <p>Hague said: \"A responsible British prime minister needs to be ready to work with either presidential candidate after the US election, and should neither take sides nor be seen to be taking sides.</p> <p>\"Gordon Brown needs to make clear why he appeared to be favouring the Democrats in this article and to explain whether this was his deliberate intention or a careless mistake.\"</p> <p>A No 10 spokesman pointed out that Brown had met McCain both in London and the USA this year, just as he had met Obama.</p> <p>\"The PM is not endorsing a candidate, and never would,\" said the spokesman.</p> <p>\"As he has made clear when asked on a number of occasions, the election is a matter for the American people, and he looks forward to working closely with whoever is the next president across a range of areas of common interest.</p> <p>\"This was an article written ahead of the party conferences in Britain and talks about some of the measures being taken around the world by centre-left political parties to deal with the current global economic challenges.\"</p> <p>Downing Street also refused to say today whether Brown had read the article before it was published, suggesting that he had not.</p> <p>Parliamentary Monitor is a relatively obscure Westminster publication and, when senior politicians are asked to submit articles to magazines of this kind, they normally delegate the writing to their officials.</p>"
