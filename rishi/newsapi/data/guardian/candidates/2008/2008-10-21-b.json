  "<p>In his latest Telegraph column - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/may/15/dailytelegraph.pressandpublishing?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=media\">kerching</a>! - Mayor Johnson of London explains why he wants Barack Obama to be America's next president, confirming the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7537054.stm\">endorsement he bestowed</a> in August when interviewed by Square Mile magazine. He said then that he thought an Obama win would be \"the most fantastic boost for black people everywhere around the world.\" His elaboration falls revealingly into line with the position he took on ethnicity, identity and disadvantage throughout his campaign for the London mayoralty, and has sought to develop since. </p> <p>An Obama win, he <a href=\"http://www.boris-johnson.com/2008/10/21/barack-obama-next-us-president/\">writes</a>, \"could signify the end of race-based politics,\" and after sharply criticising President Bush and John McCain concludes as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>After centuries of friction, prejudice, tension, hatred - you name it, they've had it - America is teetering on the brink of a triumph. If Obama wins, then the United States will have at last come a huge and maybe decisive step closer to achieving the dream of Martin Luther King, of a land where people are judged not on the colour of their skin but by the content of their character.</p> <p>If Obama wins, then black people the world over will be able to see how a gifted man has been able to smash through the ultimate glass ceiling. If Obama wins, then it will be simply fatuous to claim that there are no black role models in politics or government, because there is no higher role model than the President of the United States.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then comes the peroration's climax.</p> <blockquote> <p>If Barack Hussein Obama is successful next month, then we could even see the beginning of the end of race-based politics, with all the grievance-culture and special interest groups and political correctness that come with it. If Obama wins, he will have established that being black is as relevant to your ability to do a hard job as being left-handed or ginger-haired, and he will have re-established America's claim to be the last, best hope of Earth.</p> </blockquote> <p>This break with the Tory habit of backing Republicans has caused dismay on the right side of the blogosphere. Melanie Phillips, who appears to believe Obama is Karl Marx, Louis Farrakhan and Satan welded together, has <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/melaniephillips/2534161/boris-succumbs-to-neocon-derangement-syndrome.thtml\">smacked his bottom</a> soundly. Telegraph US editor Toby Harnden has <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/toby_harnden/blog/2008/10/21/boris_johnsons_silly_endorsement_of_barack_obama\">accused</a> him of being patronising. Conservatives from <a href=\"http://greggbeaman.blogspot.com/2008/10/mayor-of-london.html\">Manchester</a> to <a href=\"http://ozconservative.blogspot.com/2008/10/is-boris-really-conservative.html\">Melbourne</a> have declared him not of our kind.</p> <p>I've greatly enjoy these screams of agony, but also sense that Johnson's stance may be informed by something other than mere apostasy. The London mayor remains very aware that the capital's ethnic minorities regard him with suspicion. Giving the thumbs up to Obama won't hurt his efforts to allay this. That said, I don't believe his motives are cynical. </p> <p>His Telegraph piece is his latest attempt to articulate a form of cultural liberalism that disapproves of prejudice yet dislikes the oppositional cultures generated by campaigns to challenge it. It is the same outlook that makes him perfectly comfortable with gay men filling important roles in his mayoral team yet, historically at least, inclined to mock agitation for gay rights. It is the same attitude that meant the explicit anti-racism message was expunged from the annual Rise music festival yet settled, after a fashion, for declaring that it \"celebrated diversity.\" Johnson is all for fair play and meritocracy, but inclined to be against organised, politicised, demands for it.</p> <p>In fact, this is all perfectly orthodox for a socially liberal conservative. The problem, of course, is that without the marches and megaphones, the progress that's been made towards equal rights for marginalised minorities probably wouldn't have happened. There is a contradiction between Johnson's approving reference to the dream of Martin Luther King and his subsequent carping about \"special interest groups and political correctness.\" Would Obama's candidacy have been even a possibility were it not for the efforts of those who, in the decades since King's time, have continued to insist that racism be identified and challenged?</p> <p>The real weakness in Johnson's article is not his case that a President Obama would represent hope for a renewal of American democratic ideals, but his optimism that Obama's stature as a role model would render silent and redundant those demanding a better deal for all African Americans, not only the exceptional few. Perhaps that final paragraph was an attempt to woo a sceptical readership. Whatever, if Johnson is seeking to define a vision of social justice that transcends the politics of identity, he still has a little work to do.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain's path to the presidency narrowed further yesterday with reports that he was giving up on Colorado, a day after a campaign blitz in the battleground state by his running mate, Sarah Palin.</p> <p>The signs of retrenchment for McCain came on a day when Barack Obama was consumed by family concerns. The Democrat is to take a 36-hour break from the campaign tomorrow to visit his seriously ill grandmother in Hawaii.</p> <p>The first reports that McCain had given up on Colorado were carried by CNN on Monday. \"Gone,\" one adviser said. Other campaign officials, while denying they had given up on the state, told CNN they were lessening their reliance on a win in Colorado to take the White House.</p> <p>The campaign was also downgrading its chances in Iowa and New Mexico.</p> <p>The Republicans were hoping to hang on to all three states, which George Bush narrowly won in 2004.</p> <p>But with McCain's limited resources against the fundraising juggernaut of the Obama campaign, the Republican has had to make tough decisions on which battlefields to defend.</p> <p>Obama's lead in Colorado is a more modest 5 points, according to the RealClearPolitics poll average. But he has a huge advantage over the Republican in organisation, with 51 field offices in Colorado, compared with a dozen for McCain.</p> <p>\"The McCain campaign, having taken public financing, just can't play everywhere now. They don't have the resources to do that,\" said Bule Sewell, a former chair of the Colorado Democratic party.</p> <p>Obama is also outspending McCain by $300,000 (\u00a3177,000) a week on advertising.</p> <p>McCain's hopes of victory rest on holding on to Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio, Missouri and Nevada - as well as taking Pennsylvania. But Obama is even or ahead of McCain in the first seven states and has a 12-point lead in the last.</p> <p>Campaign officials yesterday tried to douse speculation McCain was pulling the plug on Colorado, where Democrats believe that the Republican could be swamped at the polls by the enthusiasm among younger voters and Latinos. However, such decisions are usually kept secret. Last month, McCain faced severe criticism for announcing he was pulling out of Michigan, another battleground.</p> <p>Palin made three campaign stops on Monday in Colorado and McCain is due there on Friday. But the campaign has barely had any advertising presence on radio or television in the state. </p> <p>\"We see the race tightening both internally and in public polling,\" said Jill Hazelbaker, his national communications director. \"We are within striking distance in the key battleground states we need to win.\"</p> <p>Michelle Obama will take a turn as the Democratic headliner on Friday, while her husband is in Hawaii. She is to make campaign stops in Akron and Columbus, Ohio. Her husband is cancelling a rally in Iowa and Wisconsin to visit his grandmother.</p> <p>Obama's absence is unlikely to hurt his campaign. In a campaign of this magnitude and duration, it is not clear how much personal appearances boost a candidate so close to polling day.</p> <p>Obama could also get a sympathy boost for taking time out to visit his white grandmother, Madleyn Dunham, 85. It allows him to demonstrate a commitment to family. He was largely brought up by her.</p> <p>His campaign released photographs of a young Obama with Dunham on his graduation from high school.</p>",
  "<p>A little shudder went through me every time they said it. \"President Obama's first priority will be this,\" they would begin. Or, \"The Obama administration will find that ... \" Travelling in the US last week, I lost count of the pundits, experts and Democratic insiders I heard speak with such confidence. And each time they did, I felt the urge to mutter: \"Presuming he wins.\"</p> <p>Call it superstition, but it's one rooted in years of unhappy experience. After the British general election of 1992, or the Al Gore and John Kerry defeats of 2000 and 2004, the centre-left has surely learned that you don't count your chickens till they're hatched, squawking and deep into middle age. Which is why I won't believe an Obama presidency is possible until the morning of November 5 - and even then I'll wait till inauguration day on January 20, just to be sure. </p> <p>This is not fully rational. But who said elections are rational? They call it political science, but there's all too little that's scientific about it. Otherwise you could weigh the data and draw definite conclusions about what is about to happen. But politics doesn't work like that. </p> <p>Rationally, I know, every indicator points to a clear victory, if not a landslide, for Barack Obama. He is ahead in the polls, including in most of the key battleground states that will determine the winner. John McCain has now given up on Michigan, Iowa, Colorado and New Mexico - and is betting everything on taking Pennsylvania, a state even Kerry managed to hold four years ago. McCain's path through the electoral college is now narrow and perilous. </p> <p>What's more, he is low on ammunition. He has just $47m to spend, while Obama raised more than three times that amount, breaking every record, last month alone. In the air war of TV advertising, McCain is coming under saturation bombardment: for every ad he runs, Obama has three, four, even eight. </p> <p>Just as important, Obama is outgunning McCain on the ground. He has field offices, staffed up and teeming with volunteers, in the unlikeliest of places - small towns that cannot remember the last time anyone remembered them. Fivethirtyeight.com's Sean Quinn has been dropping in on those and on the McCain operation and describes a stunning contrast. Not only do Obama's offices outnumber McCain's by four to one, but the latter are often empty or near-empty, filled with lines of unused phones, just one or two people making calls. Quinn added up the number of McCain volunteers he had seen in six states - and it equalled the number working for Obama in the single town of Durango, Colorado. </p> <p>The intangible signs are just as positive for Obama. The endorsement by Colin Powell got all the attention, but the Democrat has also won the backing of conservative newspapers, from the Houston Chronicle to the Idaho Statesman. No one pretends such endorsements swing elections, but they tell you something about the prevailing wind. </p> <p>And yet I still won't say this election is over. For one thing, there is no precedent for this contest: an African-American nominee for a major party is a first. We simply don't know if the notorious Bradley effect - whereby more voters tell pollsters they plan to back black candidates than actually vote for them - will bite on November 4. Last week senior Democrats were telling me to look at the Tennessee senate race of 2006. Pre-election polls showed the African-American Democrat, Harold Ford, behind by three points - and he lost by three points. The polls got it right; ergo, the Bradley effect is dead.</p> <p>But this is a presidential race; it's different. A pessimistic gut instinct tells me that older, white voters across Appalachia could break for McCain, putting Ohio and West Virginia in his column. Perhaps McCain thinks the same and that's what's prompted him to bet everything on Pennsylvania. With a relentlessly negative message in this last stretch, powered by robocalls suggesting Obama pals around with \"domestic terrorists\" and by fliers photomontaging Obama's face with that of Osama bin Laden or subtly linking him to 9/11, Republicans believe they can plant just enough fear that Obama is an alien, un-American stranger - \"Not who you think he is,\" says one leaflet - to make November 4 a very long night. Meanwhile, if Democrats grow complacent, and young voters don't turn out, believing victory is already in the bag, those Republicans could be proved right.</p> <p>But let's say I'm too much of a worrier and that we should trust the objective data - let's dare ask the question now exercising the chatterers in Washington and beyond. What would an Obama presidency be like? </p> <p>The first, depressing thought is that, if the result is close 13 days from now, Republicans will seek to challenge Obama's very legitimacy. That sounds far-fetched: after all, George W Bush only won in 2000 thanks to a single vote on the supreme court and the Democrats did not hesitate to salute him as the commander in chief. But Republicans play by different rules. Recall the treatment meted out to Bill Clinton. He won fair and square in 1992 and again in 1996, but that did not stop Republicans using every means to cast him as essentially unfit for high office - culminating in the impeachment effort of 1998. They will surely follow the same approach towards a President Obama. Indeed, they're doing it already: last week McCain campaign manager Rick Davis claimed a \"cloud of suspicion\" hangs over the election, because of Obama's links to Acorn, a grassroots group accused of trying to register bogus voters. That sounds a lot like a party preparing either to make a legal challenge to a close result - or to brand the eventual winner as illegitimate. </p> <p>If Obama wins big, that will be a harder case to make. Then what? Some Democrats are growing excited at the prospect of what could be the strongest, most progressive administration since the Lyndon Johnson landslide of 1964. That may not be wholly delusional. On current projections, the Democrats are on course to win both the House and perhaps a filibuster-proof 60 seats in the Senate. Obama would have the muscle to drive through a truly radical programme. </p> <p>Still, the voice of caution nags. First, the precedents are not encouraging. Both Clinton and Jimmy Carter were greeted by a fully Democratic Congress - and both got snarled up early. If the smoothness of his campaign is any guide, Obama will be a savvier operator than either of those two predecessors. But the danger is real. </p> <p>Second, Obama could be constrained by a simple fact: the cupboard is bare. After years of profligacy and Bush's ballooning deficits, there is too little money around for a raft of government projects that would cost dear. </p> <p>And yet, Obama has made clear that he holds the Keynesian view that a recession is precisely the time to start spending money. What's more, the banking crisis has so thoroughly discredited the laissez-faire approach to free markets, that the public mood is conducive to a shift leftward. One US historian suggests Americans only allow a dramatic expansion in government after a great rupture: FDR was preceded by the crash of 1929, LBJ by the Kennedy assassination of 1963. If that's true, then Obama might indeed prove to be, as Powell predicted, a \"transformational president\". </p> <p>See, even I'm at it now - getting way ahead of myself. Of course Obama has the potential to do all kinds of great things, but we're not there yet. First, he has to win. <br><a href=\"mailto:freedland@theguardian.com\"><br>freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>A \"perfect storm\" could be building for US election day on November 4 because of a combination of sky-high voter interest, new ballot machines and a shortage of poll staff, the independent Pew group warned yesterday.</p> <p>The Washington-based group set out a long series of problems still facing the US despite reforms aimed at avoiding a repeat of the 2000 and 2004 debacles.</p> <p>The launch of the 77-page report came as legal clashes over voter registration and hours-long queues formed outside booths set up for early voting in states across the US. Voting is now underway in 46 of the 50 states, though election day is still almost a fortnight away.</p> <p>Virginia, a battleground state, said it will step up security at polling booths on November 4. Election officials fear trouble because of passions aroused by the election, by long queues, or by people being told they are not eligible to vote.</p> <p>Doug Chapin, director of Pew's electionline.org, said: \"People talk about meltdown. It is over-optimistic to think that 130 million people can vote and something does not go wrong ... We have spent eight years sorting the plumbing, but on November 4 we are going to crank up the system.\"</p> <p>The excitement created by Barack Obama could result in a record turnout, with African-Americans and young voters, both previously less likely to vote, predicted to cast ballots in large numbers this time round. New voters are registering in record numbers in almost every state.</p> <p>Officials in Virginia recently ordered 200,000 more voter registration forms.</p> <p>Thousands of lawyers are being recruited by Obama and John McCain to police polling booths, offering advice to supporters denied the vote or challenging the eligibility of rivals.</p> <p>Pew is one of the most respected research organisations in the US, and publishes annual updates on the state of the election process.</p> <p>Yesterday's report, Election preview 2008: what if we had an election and everyone came?, says: \"Eight years after the uncovered problems in the 2000 election and more than five years after the creation of the Help America Vote Act of 2002, millions of Americans will head to the polls on November 4 in what many are predicting will be the highest-turnout election in recent memory.</p> <p>\"Like the infamous Nor'easter that sank the Andrea Gail, another perfect storm may be brewing, only this one has the potential to combine a record turnout with an insufficient number of poll workers and a voting system still in flux.\"</p> <p>Election officials are struggling in some places to recruit the tens of thousands of extra staff that will be needed.</p> <p>Another problem for election officials is the electronic voting systems introduced in many states after the \"hanging chads\" controversy in Florida in 2000.</p> <p>The report notes that voting machines bought only six years ago have been replaced in Florida, California and other states after officials and Congress became concerned about security and reliability.</p> <p>Some states and counties have returned to paper, but with optical scanners that should theoretically allow for faster counting. This amounts to the third change since 2000.</p> <p>One of the biggest flashpoints is voter registration, particularly in states such as Ohio, Indiana, Florida, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Missouri.</p> <p>Chapin said there is fierce litigation in Indiana and Georgia, where new rules require voters to show photo IDs. Republicans claim this it aimed at preventing vote fraud, while Democrats argue it is a form of voter suppression.</p> <p>The report identifies 11 states where there could be problems on election day, along with Washington DC: Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado and Virginia.</p> <p>Officials are encouraging early voting and absentee ballots to try to relieve the pressure on November 4.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Thursday October 23 2008.

  "<p>One is the 44-year-old descendant of slaves who gives passionate speeches on the campaign trail and is a fan of Stevie Wonder. The other is a multimillionaire businesswoman, 10 years older, who keeps in the background and prefers the Rolling Stones.</p> <p>In the battle of the would-be first ladies, the contrast could not be more profound. Michelle Obama and Cindy McCain have little in common in their backgrounds or style, and the gulf is likely to be reflected in the approach adopted by whichever one takes up residence in the White House next January.</p> <p>Obama has been highly active during the presidential race. She has made frequent forays into battleground states, matching her husband's skills as an orator in solo appearances. But since the summer, when she was criticised for an unguarded comment that her husband's success had made her feel proud of her country for the first time, she has been careful to present herself foremost as mother and wife.</p> <p>The tactic was visible in a recent stump speech she made in Indiana, which the Democrats hope to win for the first time since 1964. \"I've come here first as a wife,\" she began, \"who has seen my husband grow and stand strong and knows in my soul without a doubt that he will be an extraordinary president.\" She talked of \"tucking in our children and grandchildren at night\" and referred to her husband as \"babe\". But she also dwelt on politics, stressing the need for universal healthcare, affordable college education and troop withdrawal from Iraq.</p> <p>McCain, by contrast, has cut a quieter figure. She is usually to be seen standing behind her husband dressed in an immaculate Escada suit in almost regal silence. She speaks rarely and then fleetingly, the one exception being her 20-minute oration to the Republican national convention last month.</p> <p>Michelle Obama came from a working-class family in a black neighbourhood on the south side of Chicago, attending the largely white institutions of Princeton and Harvard to emerge as a lawyer and then as a senior manager in a Chicago hospital.</p> <p>Cindy McCain had a more conventional trajectory. Born in Phoenix where she still lives, she was a state rodeo queen and a cheerleader in the University of Southern California, where she studied special education. She met her husband - then married to someone else - in 1979, bringing to their union a fortune inherited from her father's beer distribution firm, which she now chairs. Her wealth is put at more than $100m (\u00a358.8m), including eight houses that landed her husband in trouble when he was unable to put a number to them.</p> <p>Cindy McCain's biographer, Alicia Colon, believes her bearing in the White House would be marked by diffidence. She would eschew promoting policy, and would not follow Rosalynn Carter's example and sit in cabinet meetings. \"She is not very political and the only reason she agreed with John McCain's decision to run again is because she feels he is the best person to lead the country in these perilous times,\" Colon said.</p> <p>McCain herself sees her main function as her husband's sounding board. \"I'm the one person who will tell him in the end exactly what I think and what's wrong,\" she told a TV interviewer. She has said she would focus on adoption, a subject dear to her heart after she brought home a child from Bangladesh in 1991, famously presenting the baby to her husband without notice, with the words \"this is your new daughter\". </p> <p>She would also use the role to encourage volunteering, and to bring public attention to addiction, a personal cause that stems from her three-year addiction to painkillers in the early 1990s. She sees Princess Diana's charitable activities as a role model, she has told reporters.</p> <p>Myra Gutin, author of The First Lady in the 20th Century, divides past first ladies into three categories. There are those who saw their job as largely ceremonial - the White Housekeepers as she has dubbed them - such as Bess Truman and Mamie Eisenhower. Then there is the class of what Gutin calls \"emerging spokeswomen\" - those who made use of the influence the White House offered as a podium to address the country. She puts Jacqueline Kennedy and both the Bushes, Barbara and Laura, into this group.</p> <p>Finally, there are the activists, such as Lady Bird Johnson, who helped draft legislation, Betty Ford, who openly disagreed with some of Gerald's policies, and Eleanor Roosevelt, who went as far as to hire presidential aides.</p> <p>Gutin predicts that were McCain to become first lady she would be an emerging spokeswoman. \"She is certainly not a shrinking violet, but nor is she comfortable in the public spotlight.\"</p> <p>But with opinion polls swinging steadily towards the Democrats, it is likely that Obama will be the one to inherit Laura Bush's title. If so, she will be America's first black first lady, a historic distinction which, combined with her inherent political instincts, would shape her approach.</p> <p>Obama, Gutin believes, would fall into the activist mould. \"That's more in tune with her personality and her relationship with her husband, who would encourage her to take the lead in a project, probably in the area of education.\"</p> <p>Nonetheless, Obama would be aware of the difficulties Hillary Clinton got into when she took on a full policy portfolio, healthcare reform, soon after entering the White House. Clinton's failed initiative damaged her own reputation and sapped the political strength of the president, Bill.</p> <p>Obama has indicated she would be unlikely to follow Hillary's example and set up a base inside the West Wing of the White House; she would confine herself to the family section in the East Wing. She would also suspend her work as a lawyer to avoid conflicts of interest, and focus on issues such as the work-life balance affecting working women.</p> <p>Her priority, as it has been during the punishing two years of the presidential race, would be to provide a modicum of normality for her daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, seven.</p>",

  "<p>It's a deal nobody likes, but if the <a href=\"http://www.rttnews.com/Content/GeneralNews.aspx?Node=B1&amp;Id=744638\">Iraqi and US governments</a> fail to reach a legally binding status of forces agreement by the end of December, startling consequences could quickly ensue. US troops would be required to cease all land and air operations; all military personnel would be confined to base; and preparations for wholesale withdrawal would begin.</p> <p>That eventuality would be met with a cheer or three by Iraqis opposed to continuing occupation \u2013 a majority, according to opinion polls \u2013 and by opponents of Iraq policy in Europe and the US. Making the point, thousands of followers of the radical Shia cleric, Moqtada al-Sadr, <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hwK_CSpBxsNuVUEaDuOwmSSCiqGwD93SQ8LO0\">took to Baghdad's streets</a> on Saturday to demand that the US, Britain and the rest get out immediately.</p> <p>The prospect of a sudden, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/17/iraq-usa\">involuntary US exit</a> has also been moved closer by the belated realisation that the UN security council, bypassed by George Bush before the 2003 invasion, might be reluctant to extend the occupying powers mandate it subsequently agreed. Veto-wielding Russia, still smarting over the Georgia row, could in theory refuse to go along.</p> <p>Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, says he is confident it will not come to that and a deal will done by Christmas.

Last week, aides to Iraq's prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601081&amp;sid=awzMnOuviHOw&amp;refer=australia\">Nouri al-Maliki</a>, outlined a draft agreement replacing the UN mandate with a bilateral pact allowing US forces to stay until 2011, but Shia parties within Maliki's ruling coalition have since blocked it.</p> <p>The Iraqi cabinet <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hwK_CSpBxsNuVUEaDuOwmSSCiqGwD93UU05O1\">met again today</a> to discuss the draft terms, but final agreement was not expected and the foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, predicted the required parliamentary vote would not be held until after next month's US presidential election.</p> <p>Shia parties controlling 85 of parliament's 275 seats, including the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council and Maliki's Dawa party, object to the draft for two main reasons. One is that it allows America's tenure to be extended after 2011 if both sides agree. That has raised the spectre of an ongoing US military presence entrenched in quasi-permanent bases \u2013 something the Pentagon, despite much scepticism, insists it does not want.</p> <p>The second objection is that US nationals who commit crimes under Iraqi law will not be subject to Iraqi justice other than in exceptional circumstances. That, say some lawmakers, is a further affront to Iraq's battered sovereignty.</p> <p>Other considerations are at work. Iraqi officials privately admit they need US military support, particularly air cover and help with logistics and training, for the foreseeable future. While Maliki apparently accepts this, he is also an Iraqi nationalist proud of the progress the country's reformulated, 600,000-strong security forces have made in subduing problem areas such as Basra and Sadr City in Baghdad.</p> <p>Analysts suspect Maliki would like to see the back of the Americans before 2011 if it could be managed \u2013 hence his feting this summer of Democrat Barack Obama, who proposes a 16-month withdrawal deadline. Like fellow Shia and Sunni politicians, he knows feeble acceptance of a continuing US occupation could severely dent voter support in upcoming provincial and general elections. Members of the main Sunni Muslim Tawafiq, or Accordance bloc are making similar calculations.</p> <p>Ironically perhaps, Bush doesn't much like the deal on the table either. Like the Republican presidential candidate John McCain, he has always resisted setting firm timetables. His senior general, David Petraeus, went out of his way recently to warn of the several \"potential storm clouds\" that still threatened \u2013 including simmering sectarianism, the status of Kirkuk, religious persecution as in Mosul, the relationship with Kurdistan, oil revenue-sharing and the rights of returning refugees.</p> <p>According to Petraeus, who now heads <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/20/nato-afghanistan\">US Central Command</a> overseeing the entire Middle East, all these considerations argue for a slow, careful approach to Iraq troop draw-downs.</p> <p>American caution directly relates to another key factor: arch-enemy Iran's continuing attempts to manipulate Iraqi politics for its own ends. Tehran wants the Americans out right now and is lobbying hard against the draft pact. So hard, in fact, that the US commander, General Ray Odierno, accused Iran last week of bribing MPs. His claim brought a sharp rebuke from Maliki who said, rather portentously, that Odierno \"had risked his position\".</p> <p>The US-Iranian struggle for influence in post-occupation Iraq is a coming story \u2013 and Maliki and his fellow nationalists are caught in the middle. Manoeuvring against the importunate Americans may make short-term political sense, even if it ignores security realities. But Iran's ongoing machinations also threaten the recovery of national sovereignty.</p> <p>With a foot in both camps but belonging to neither, Maliki doesn't want to choose between the two.</p>",
  "<p>By night, the <a href=\"http://www.carpenters.org/\">Carpenters and Joiners Union</a> building on Alum Creek Drive in Columbus, Ohio, appears grey and indistinct. But there was no missing the pre-debate conversations coming from the car park. This was one of many locations across Columbus chosen by the American Federation of Labour and Congress of Industrial Organisation - the famous <a href=\"http://www.aflcio.org/\">AFL-CIO</a> - for its members to get together and watch the final televised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-barackobama2\">debate between Barack Obama and John McCain</a>. The union's largely composed of those blue-collar workers required to win Ohio for the Democrats.</p> <p>The AFL-CIO <a href=\"http://blog.aflcio.org/2008/06/26/afl-cio-endorses-obama-launches-meet-barack-obama/\">came out early in support of Obama</a> during the Democratic primaries, with its president, Joe Rugola, describing Obama as <a href=\"http://www.dispatchpolitics.com/live/content/editorials/stories/2008/07/20/hallett20.ART_ART_07-20-08_G5_3FAPN87.html?sid=101\">\"the smartest candidate for president I've ever met\"</a>. But for some being smart isn't enough - it's Obama's race that's the barrier. In recognition, Rugola and the union instituted a campaign to back Obama on the issues but recognising that \"some folks are going to have a problem with what we're saying about Barack Obama's ability to be a leader because he's African-American.\"</p> <p>Among the union members was Norman Wernet, a state director for the Alliance for Retired Americans (ARA) in Ohio. He confessed, with a sigh, that the issue of race \"wasn't addressed four years ago in the 2004 election\". However there's a big push now, he said.</p> <p>Overhearing our conversation, David, a retired pipe-fitter, breaks away from the table and the small crowd around it having their fill of the pizzas and pretzels laid on - and heads toward us. David also works for the ARA as a volunteer. He takes pride in some of the volunteers he's helped to recruit, some of whom are well into their 80s. \"It's about the issues ... the $1.3tn that McCain will take out of Medicare,\" he says.<br> If David is right that the membership, in the end, will vote on the issues, and the union is convinced that the Democrats have the right programme, why is Obama struggling to win over the older union vote? David has an explanation. He argues that when the older generation of Poles, Germans and other European immigrants established communities in Ohio, they didn't even interact with one another, let alone the black community. He says when he visits the older members of these communities, in places like Cleveland and Toledo, he tells them: \"When going to war, would you rather have a black friend or a white enemy?\" Part of the AFL-CIO's campaign is not only to confront the harsh realities of race in this presidential election, but the political challenge of the much-debated <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect\">Bradley effect</a> - named after Tom Bradley, the African-American mayor of Los Angeles who failed to win the governorship of California in 1982, despite holding a wide lead in pre-election polls. This is a huge political question in a marginally Republican state such as Ohio, with a columnist, Joe Hallett, in the <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/\">Columbus Dispatch</a> newspaper suggesting that the Bradley effect makes opinion polls here harder to rely on.<br> Theotis James, the fast-talking president of the Transport Workers Union in Ohio (and an African-American), believes blue-collar voters will come down to deciding on the candidates' records, not their race. Anyhow, Theotis laughed, \"nothing's going to affect the way I vote.\"</p> <p>Theotis's relaxed approach gives credence to a quiet political shift, noted in the New York Times, which shows <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/14/us/politics/14race.html?pagewanted=print\">a growing number of African-Americans are being elected</a> in predominately white districts, \"in states like New Hampshire, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina and Tennessee\". Is Ohio and America about to go national with that trend? I'm in a precinct of Ohio where 23% of the electorate is African-American, according to David Robinson, who is running as a Democrat for a congressional seat under the slogan: \"A new energy for Ohio, a new voice in Congress\". His pitch reflected this new energy, that the younger white voters and young families moving into the area will outweigh the older voters.</p> <p>Before getting seated for the debate, Bruce Bostick stops to chat. Although retired, Bruce still considers himself a steelworker. At the bottom of his business card he has printed: \"United we stand, divided we fall\". He says of the Bradley effect: \"We may see some of that \u2026 but we won't see it at the levels of the past.\" He's at pains to point out that the labour unions haven't been given the credit they deserve for tackling the issue.</p> <p>As we watch the debate and the subject turns to the economy, Bruce vocalises his comrade-in-arms credentials, as he shouts at McCain on-screen: \"We are all fighting a class war. We just wanna have our class win once in a while.\"</p>",
  "<p>On Sunday I was invited to dinner with my partner in the Maryland suburbs of Washington DC. We were alerted in advance this enclave might feel a bit foreign \u2013 meaning that, unlike most of downtown DC, this family was solidly Republican. Indeed, a McCain-Palin lawn sign stood firmly planted in their lawn, the family minivan was plastered with McCain-Palin stickers and the hostess wore a <a href=\"http://www.aspendesigns.com/mccain-pins.html\">McCain-Palin pin</a>.</p> <p>There was no reason to comment: the atmosphere was convivial and friendly, the conversation meandered for nearly two hours before it rolled around to the election. But when it did come up - one guest at the dinner party sheepishly admitted he had forgotten to register to vote, which in the Washington metropolitan area is akin to forgetting to enroll a child in school - the conversation took an uncomfortable turn. What followed was more anthropological than intellectual. Rather than a nuanced conversation on campaign strategy, or policy decisions, this was a clash of civilizations. The hostess demanded the table to provide \"one single reason to vote for Obama\". Her rhetoric \u2013 and tone \u2013 began to rise. I held my tongue (very unusual for me), as I didn't know the family. <br> This was the grinding sound of the two Americas sliding up against each other like tectonic plates. The whole interaction was unsettling. It's one thing to flip over to Fox News, or laugh at Sarah Palin impersonations. It's another to consider how deep the fissures in the country still are - Colin Powell's endorsement of Obama not withstanding. On the way out, as the hostess kissed us goodbye, she said: \"May the best man win.\" And then she couldn't resist a final twist. \"Good luck,\" she said, \"in your socialist country if it's your side that wins.\"  What is this new nefarious trope of socialism? It's come up recently in Sarah Palin's rallies \u2013 in Roswell, New Mexico, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/10/19/politics/fromtheroad/entry4531388.shtml\">Palin raised the spectre</a> around the false character of Joe the Plumber: \"Senator Obama said he wants to, quote, spread the wealth. What that means is he wants government to take your money and dole it out however a politician sees fit,\" she said, \"But Joe the Plumber and Ed the Dairy Man, I believe that they think that it sounds more like socialism\u2026. Friends, now is no time to experiment with socialism.\"</p> <p>Later, at a press session in Colorado, Palin defended her comments. \"There are socialist principles to that, yes,\" Palin said, referring to Obama's tax proposals. \"Taking more from a small business or small business owners or from a hard-working families and then redistributing that money according to a politician's priorities - there are hints of socialism in there and that's why I don't fault or discredit Joe the Plumber for bringing that up, asking if that is socialism.\" Socialism has become another code word like \"liberal,\" for being \"anti-American.\" In the Palin universe, there is nothing between libertarianism and anti-Americanism. Government projects are \"socialist\". It's clear she hasn't spent much time in Europe. <br> Two days earlier, Michele Bachman - a Republican representative from Minnesota (not a state known for conservatism) - all but called for a <a href=\" http://www.nps.gov/archive/elro/glossary/huac.htm \">House Un-American Activities Committee</a> to investigate into the actions of her colleagues in the House of Representatives. Chattering on to <a href=\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" ejiqm_7yaui\" \">Chris Matthews </a> about the \"troika\" of \"liberal\" and \"anti-American\" representatives and Senators who should be the subject of a \"penetrating expose\" by the media to find out who is truly pro-American. (and in the days since it's become clear she's subsequently dulled own <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/politics/state/31261989.html\">chances of re-election</a> this fall) <br> This is all very worrisome. Beyond Bachman's dehistoricized, blithe call to grill her colleagues on their patriotism, do these politicians really believe that government officials are <em>anti</em> American? The continuation of this trend towards whipping up Americans to distrust other Americans will fester long after this election is over.</p>",

(A friend of mine who was at the debate said the crowd gasped at McCain's callous disregard for women's health.)\"</p> <p>According to McCain, the term \"health of the mother\" has been \"stretched by the extreme pro-abortion\" movement to mean almost anything. Yes, women's health encompasses many aspects, and thank goodness for that. One of the reasons women live longer than men is because we have to deal with reproductive health with such frequency, and thus see our doctors more often and are generally in better touch with our bodies. McCain and Sarah Palin would seem to want women to live in the dark ages again, with <a href=\"http://www.renodiscontent.com/2008/10/15/mccain-mocks-womens-health-during-debate/\">limited access to contraception and limited knowledge</a>.</p> <p>The McCain air-quote comment came in the midst of a serious back and forth on the ban on late-term abortions in this country, which George Bush signed into law in 2003. With respect to late-term abortion, Obama is against it, but he believes strongly there must be an exception when the mother's health is at risk. So do <a href=\"http://64.233.169.104/search?q=cache:V_xqC1syv9cJ:abcnews.go.com/images/pdf/883a29PartialBirthAbortion.pdf+americans+support+ban+on+partial+birth+abortion+health+exception+for+the+mother&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a\">most Americans</a>. Although over 60% believe such procedures should be banned, 60% also believe that if the mother's health is at risk, such a procedure should be allowed under law. </p> <p>And McCain? He has become more virulently anti-choice over the years. That's OK with me. I wouldn't vote for an anti-choice candidate, but I also wouldn't vote only on choice. The McCain comment, however, is just one more indication that he has very little understanding about what is important to American women. And nor, it appears, does he want to.<br>Although <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/10/advocates_slam.html\">choice advocates</a> maintain the air-quote gaffe is about abortion rights, I think it's about something much more fundamental. McCain has repeatedly <a href=\"http://crooksandliars.com/2008/06/07/mccain-and-womens-issues-its-more-than-just-roe/\">denigrated women</a> in word and deed, including <a href=\"http://majikthise.typepad.com/majikthise_/2008/04/straight-talk-e.html\">his own wife</a>.</p> <p>Frankly, that's between him and Cindy. But mocking women's health is not OK, especially with McCain so baldly seeking white women's votes with his choice of Palin as vice-president. Well, that <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/blogs/margie-omero/\">backfired</a>, and <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenumbers/\">white women's support for McCain</a> meets, or is lower than, pre-Palin levels. </p> <p>McCain is a mystery to me. At the debates, he's seemed angry, almost manic. His stupid mocking of women's health, even when put into the context of an issue he may feel very strongly about, is bad politics, and it's harmful. In a year when women, especially married white women, have been told their vote is paramount, how does it feel to have a presidential candidate mock the very thing that's most crucial to anyone: her health?</p>",
  "<p>President Ahmadinejad <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/08/AR2008100803527.html\">has had to cave into strikers across Iran</a>. <a href=\"http://survey07.ituc-csi.org/getcountry.php?IDCountry=IRN&amp;IDLang=EN\">Strikes are illegal</a>, so how is it that industrial action succeeded when years of strikes by factory workers and government employees have been brutally put down? Well, this was a strike by not just your average group of workers.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of small shops make up the labyrinthine bazaars of Tehran and together their owners comprise the class that legitimises the Iranian government. Ayatollah Khomeini and his successor would be nothing without the bazaaris. <a href=\"http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do?id=290507\">Authors Andreas Malm and Shora Esmailian</a>, in Iran on the Brink characterise the centuries-old bazaar as something that fosters a powerful petit bourgeoisie every bit as much as the coal-mines of 19th-century Europe fostered a proletariat. Well, President Ahmadinejad just had the gall to take them on. And he lost.</p> <p>It was the Shah's dreams of demolishing the bazaars that, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199603/kaplan-iran\">finally, cost him</a> \u2013 and his US backers \u2013 his throne. The bazaaris together with the clerical class outflanked the left and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iran-versus-the-west-the-view-from-the-tehran-bazaar-436566.html\">sewed up the coalition</a> that has ruled Iran since the Islamic Revolution. Somehow, President Ahmadinejad thought <a href=\"http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8707190745\">he could implement a 3% VAT charge</a> on the class that keeps him in power.</p> <p>There were general strikes in the bazaars of Isfahan, Mashhad, Tabriz and Tehran. \"Asshole\" was what they were calling the president when I went through the alleys of Tehran's dusty bazaar where gruff traders work long hours to maintain some of the richest livelihoods in Iran. \"Why should we pay tax when none of Khamenei's cronies do? Do you think Rafsanjani pays sales tax?\" He was referring to former president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, chairman of the assembly of experts which theoretically chooses Ayatollah Khamanei's successor. Rafsanjani also chairs the expediency council which mediates between parliament and those who vet parliamentary candidates, and his family is <a href=\"http://www.iranian.com/Travelers/2003/July/Rich/\">very, very rich</a>.</p> <p>After the jewellery trader gave me some tea, he changed the numbers on a digital board to reflect the creeping rise in gold prices and said he had had enough of Ahmadinejad. He said his friends on the Bonyad-e Mostazafin or Foundation of the Oppressed would destroy the president. The <a href=\"http://www.ecssr.ac.ae/CDA/en/FeaturedTopics/DisplayTopic/0,1670,502-98-43,00.html\">Bonyads</a> are \"charitable\" institutions that dominate the economy. This Bonyad, exempt from any auditing or taxes, produces two-thirds of all the bricks, tyres and chemicals in the country. They even produce the home-grown, <a href=\"http://deconstructinghairy.blogspot.com/2008/05/holy-cola-war.html\">anti-imperialist cola</a>, Zam-Zam, which traces its roots to the days when bazaaris's pressured the government to kick Pepsi out of the country because it was hurting the bazaars' lemonade makers. I asked about strikes being illegal and he said that if Ahmadinejad didn't cancel the tax, the bazaaris would have students, doctors and nurses out on the streets in support. \"We would overthrow the government just like we did in 1979!\"</p> <p>\"Why are we spending all our money on Hizbollah and Hamas when we need money here?\" he asked, \"at least gold prices will soon rise because of George Bush.\"</p> <p>I walked through the maze of stalls selling microwaves, carpets, chadors, pots and pans, stationery and duvets and out towards the late 18th-century mosque scarred by scaffolding with its courtyard of switched-off fountains. It was as quiet as I had ever seen it. Within hours, Ahmadinejad ordered the economy ministry to back down. Parliament had approved the tax last year and finally summoned up the courage to implement it only to find itself powerless in the face of the merchants.</p> <p>Official inflation is around 30% and when the government sent a minister, <a href=\"http://www.parstimes.com/law/taxation_system.html\">Ali Akbar Arab-Mazar</a>, to pacify Isfahan's bazaar, he was told to go back to Tehran. Trying to put a brave face on it, Ahmadinejad's new finance minister, Shamsoddin Hosseini said on TV that the government should have explained things better. As things stand, it looks like Ahmadinejad cannot implement any of the plans drawn up by his economic advisers. What they fail to understand is that <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/05/28/business/ihousing.php\">the influx of foreign remittances pump up the skyrocketing property markets</a> of Iran's big cities. That's where the inflation comes from.</p> <p>Already, the perception that there is less of an imminent threat from Israel or the United States is causing problems for the Iranian government. It has been relying on the external menace to prop up political power and the less Bush talks, the more room there is in Iran for dissent. Perhaps <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-zoPgv_nYg\">only John McCain</a> can save a regime that smells both of Soviet communism and the Sicilian Mafia. Then again, Senator <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/vcCandidateFeed7/idUSN0749229520081009\">Obama's desire for more sanctions</a> will help the Iranian government, too.</p>",
  "<p>A \"perfect storm\" could be building for the US election day because of a combination of sky-high voter interest, new ballot machines and a shortage of poll staff, the independent Pew organisation warned today.</p> <p>The Washington-based group set out a long string of problems still facing the US in spite of reforms aimed at avoiding a repeat of the 2000 and 2004 debacles.</p> <p>The launch of the 77-page report at a Washington press conference came against a background of legal clashes over voter registration and hours-long queues already forming outside booths set up for early voting in states across the US. Voting is now under way in 46 of the 50 states, though election day is still almost a fortnight away.</p> <p>Virginia, a battleground state, announced today it is to step up security at polling booths on November 4. Election officials fear trouble because of passions aroused by the election, by long queues or by people being told they are not eligible to vote.</p> <p>Doug Chapin, director of Pew's electionline.org, said: \"People talk about meltdown. It is undeniable that the election system is going to face its biggest-ever test.\"</p> <p>He added: \"It is over-optimistic to think that 130m people can vote and something does not go wrong ... We have spent eight years sorting the plumbing but on November 4 we are going to crank up the system.\"</p> <p>The pressure is mainly because the excitement created by Barack Obama could result in a record turnout, with African Americans and young voters, both traditionally notorious for failing to vote, predicted to cast ballots in large numbers this time round.</p> <p>New voters are registering in record numbers in almost every state.</p> <p>Election officials in Virginia recently ordered 200,000 additional voter registration forms.</p> <p>Thousands of lawyers are being recruited by Obama and John McCain to police the polling booths, offering advice to supporters denied the vote or to challenge the eligibility of rivals.</p> <p>Pew is one of the most respected research organisations in the US, and<br>publishes annual updates on the state of the election process.</p> <p>Today's report, Election Preview 2008: What if we had an election and everyone came?, says: \"Eight years after the uncovered problems in the 2000 election and more than five years after the creation of the Help America Vote Act of 2002, millions of Americans will head to the polls on November 4 in what many are predicting will be the highest turnout election in recent memory.</p> <p>\"Like the infamous Nor'easter that sank the Andrea Gail, another perfect storm may be brewing, only this one has the potential to combine a record turnout with an insufficient number of poll workers and a voting system still in flux.\"</p> <p>Election officials are struggling in some places to recruit the tens of thousands of extra staff that will be needed.</p> <p>Another problem for election officials is the electronic voting systems introduced in many states after the \"hanging chads\" mess in Florida in 2000.</p> <p>The report notes that voting machines bought only six years ago have been replaced in Florida, California and other states after election officials and Congress became concerned about security and reliability.</p> <p>Some states and counties have returned to paper, but with optical scanners that should theoretically allow for faster counting. This amounts to the third change since 2000.</p> <p>One of the biggest flashpoints is voter registration, particularly in states such as Ohio, Indiana, Florida, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Missouri.</p> <p>Chapin said there is fierce litigation in Indiana and Georgia, where recently-adopted rules require voters to show photo IDs. Republicans claim this it aimed at preventing voter fraud, while Demococrats argue that it is a form of voter suppression.</p> <p>There is also conflict over whether students can vote in the counties where they are attending university or whether they should be registered in their home states.</p> <p>Chapin said that one of the reasons why elections were such an issue in the US was that, unlike other democracies where organisation is done centrally, they are handled at state and county level.</p> <p>The report identifies 12 states where there could be problems on election day because of lack of poll workers, new voting machines or voter registration rows: Washington DC, Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado and Virginia.</p> <p>Officials are encouraging early voting and absentee ballots to try to relieve the pressure on November 4.</p>",
  "<p>The day Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac finally fell, six long weeks ago, and the government stepped in with hundreds of billions of dollars of loan guarantees, I was returning from a weekend trip to <a href=\"http://www.goldengatephoto.com/WestUS/halfdometrip.html\">Yosemite</a>. The day before, my friend Jason and I had scaled Half Dome rock.</p> <p>Half Dome is nearly two miles above sea level. To get to it, you have to walk nearly five miles, up steep, winding mountain paths. Then, your legs weak and lungs burning, you have to climb up hundreds of steep steps cut into the granite. Finally, you reach a plateau; you lie down and try to get your body back under control; and then you go for the summit. To reach it is a leap of faith. Half Dome is too steep to walk up; but one small part of the cliff face is \"only\" at a 45 degree angle. Pairs of stakes have been hammered into the rock at 10 or 20 feet intervals; and steel cables threaded along them.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.yosemitevacation.com/_hd-photo_gallery.htm#Gallery\">To conquer Half Dome</a>, you have to pull yourself up 400 feet of cables. You take deep breaths, haul yourself from one set of stakes to the next, wedge your feet against the wooden slats at each set of stakes; and then repeat the process. If you fall, there's absolutely nothing to stop you \u2013 a terrifying fact you're reminded of every few minutes when someone drops their water bottle. Fall at just the right angle and you'll land hundreds of feet below with broken bones galore, but alive; fall at a slightly different angle and you slide off the edge of the cliff and drop thousands of feet to the valley floor.</p> <p>So, what does this have to do with our current economic woes? Well, we know we've lost our footing and fallen from a great height. In the weeks since Freddie and Fannie were essentially nationalised, investment banks and thrift banks have failed, credit markets have frozen, investors started runs on money market accounts, banks the world over have been semi-nationalised, trillions of dollars of taxpayers' money has been put on the line to support the system, stock markets have dived and several countries have themselves veered towards insolvency. That much is a given. What we don't yet know \u2013 and won't for months, possibly even years \u2013 is the extent of the damage. Will our economies and societies emerge battered but alive? Or will the system of exchange and wealth creation that we have taken for granted for generations prove unfixable?</p> <p>If that sounds melodramatic, it's meant to be. We're in the midst of the sort of collective re-imagining of national and global institutions, of the obligations of government and the needs of citizenries, that occurs perhaps once every couple of generations. </p> <p>At the end of the day, governments will emerge from the near-meltdown of the global financial system either larger or smaller. If they succeed in staunching the fiscal haemorrhage, governments will emerge much larger \u2013 with ownership stakes in pillars of the economy, with roles as extensive regulators and arbiters of the marketplace that they have not previously had, and with populations demanding they use that new clout not just to keep financial markets solvent but to keep populations out of poverty \u2013 through, for example, new health coverage systems and new employment schemes. If they fail, recession will turn into depression, tax revenues will shrivel, meaning that governments, too, will contract, and even the most powerful nations will find their organs of state incapable of mitigating the consequences of the meltdown. Within that broad range of possibilities the one thing we can be pretty certain of is that governing apparatuses and international relations won't emerge looking identical to how they did going in to 2008.</p> <p>In the desperate days before France fell to the Nazis, Churchill and the French government parlayed about the possibility of <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/pss/260024\">merging France and the United Kingdom</a> into one country. In the years after the second world war and the explosion of two atomic bombs over Japan, many scholars pondered the possibility of world government as a way to avoid competing nations marching toward nuclear catastrophe.</p> <p>Both of those ideas hadn't a snowball in hell's chance of success, but they did in some ways affect the timbre of international relations. England and France never unified, but during the 60 years following the end of the war the European Union emerged as a continental entity with at least some supranational governing responsibilities. World government was never a serious option, but the United Nations has remained a durable institution and organisations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency, the IMF and the World Bank have operated, with varying degrees of success, on a transnational basis for many decades.</p> <p>So, as the current order crumbles, how about a bit more emphasis on the eirenic? The 15th and 16th century scholar <a href=\"http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/erasmus.html\">Desiderius Erasmus</a> advocated a system of international relations based around harmony and fairness rather than competition and warfare. As new domestic institutions, along with a new system of international relations, emerges out of the failed economic experiment of the past three decades, let's start a real conversation about who's included in the new system. Already responses to the crisis are being hammered out not by the G-8 but by the G-20. That's a start, but it still leaves unconsidered the interests of the billions of people living outside these 20 large economies.</p> <p>There's been a lot of talk in America recently about saving the middle classes; as well as propping up the structure of the first world economy upon which global prosperity depends. And I certainly don't underestimate the importance of that. But there's a risk that attention to poverty, to domestic working classes and impoverished peoples overseas, gets lost in this mix. </p> <p>Both Barack Obama and John McCain have gone out of their way to appeal to the struggling middle class in the US election. Partly that's because the vast majority of Americans, no matter how blue collar they might be, self-identifies as either middle class or as aspiring to attain middle-class status. But partly it's because there's more political capital to be gained from paying attention to people who've lost thousands of dollars in their 401(k)s than to people who never had <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/401K\">401(k)s</a> to begin with. The wealthier you are in America, the more likely you are to vote. That's been true for decades.</p> <p>Obama's economic package at least talks about raising the minimum wage and indexing it to inflation; and his advocacy of a three-month halt to home foreclosures would give at least some reprieve to working families teetering on the edge of personal catastrophe. McCain, by contrast, does little more than advocate more tax cuts \u2013 which doesn't really address the problem of a growing underclass too poor to pay significant amounts of taxes in the first place, already reliant on government and charity food subsidies, and increasingly unable to establish decent credit, relying instead on exorbitantly high interest payday loans, check-cashing outlets, and pawn shops for their borrowing needs. </p> <p>Commentators have spent much time analysing Obama and McCain's differing body language in their third debate. To my mind, the most interesting moment was when McCain challenged Obama on why he opposed a free-trade agreement with Columbia. Obama answered that labour leaders in Colombia were being targeted by death squads. The camera panned to Mccain; as Obama talked of trade union leaders being assassinated, the Republican rolled his eyes.</p> <p>I think at this point we can take it as a given that Obama is more concerned with the rights of working people than is McCain. But that doesn't necessarily mean Obama's talking in strong enough terms about poverty in the post-fall era.</p> <p>If we're going to set up new institutions to mediate money-flows, let's set up some system to invest in developing countries, especially around tackling the issue of global warming. Last year the <a href=\"http://www.undp.org/climatechange/\">United Nations Development Programme</a> issued a report detailing how poorer nations needed access to billions of dollars to alleviate the affects of already-unleashed climate change; and billions more to upgrade their energy systems so as to be able to move into a post-carbon age and limit any further planetary temperature increases. Without it, they warned, poor regions would see increased drought, water shortages, epidemics and starvation.</p> <p>At the same time, let's have a serious conversation about developing bigger and better micro-lending institutions, so that small business owners and farmers around the world can survive the hard times ahead, and, down the road, move their families toward economic security. Let's talk about renegotiating poor countries' debt obligations; after all, if first world governments can buy up trillions of dollars in \"toxic debt\" from banks, why can they not perform a similar function for development-hindering debt owed by poorer nations? That wouldn't mean a canceling of debt, but rather a renegotiation, akin to the notion of revamping the corrosive variable rate sub-prime mortgages pushing so many US families into homelessness.</p> <p>These are just a few anti-poverty measures that could be taken. Many more could, and should, be developed over the coming years.</p> <p>Early on in the Democratic primary season, John Edwards talked passionately about a fairer deal for America's poor. Like Bobby Kennedy 40 years earlier, he went beyond mere platitudes about \"Main Street\" and the hurting middle classes. As we enter the final days of the presidential race, and start imagining the new institutions, the new social compact that a post-financial meltdown world demands, there's even more urgency that issues of engrained poverty, both in the US and overseas, are addressed in a smart, transnational manner.</p>",
  "<p>Apparently, it's all Jimmy Carter's fault. It was Carter who brought the first virulent strain of political religiosity to the White House. Carter who first wore his Christian faith on his presidential sleeve. Carter who first alerted his Republican opponents to a voter base who cared more about faith than about policy. (Reagan trounced Carter at the next election to some degree by playing the \"holier-than-thou\" card.) Since Carter, no American president or presidential nominee has professed anything other than piousness \u2013 religion has become simply a prerequisite for the job, in much the same way as being white and male once was.</p> <p>This, at least, is the view of Larry Charles, whose new documentary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126615/religulous\">Religulous</a> had its UK premiere in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/londonfilmfestival\">London film festival</a> at the weekend. Charles didn't go quite so far as to demand Carter hand back his Nobel prize, but given the apocalyptic tone of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film\">film</a>'s conclusion, he might as well have. His film, a collaboration with late night TV host Bill Maher, argues that religion is not only ridiculous \u2013 hence the film's title \u2013 but that, in a society afraid to challenge its dogmas, religion is downright dangerous. A mushroom cloud montage worthy of Kubrick summarises the argument, and when you see the current leader of the free world say, \"I believe that God wants everybody to be free \u2013 and that's one part of my foreign policy,\" it's hard not to feel a little disturbed.</p> <p>In truth though, Religulous is not a film that takes its own arguments all that seriously. It is, first and foremost, \"a date movie\" \u2013 the sort of film that, whether you agree with its agenda or not, should at least have you laughing. Like Charles's last film, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/114557/borat\">Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan</a>, its principal achievement is to make Americans look really, really dumb. One of the film's funniest moments comes from a Democrat senator, Mark Pryor, who, having admitted the jury is still out as far as he is concerned about \"Adam and Eve 5,000 years ago with a talking snake in a garden\", goes on to admit that \"you don't have to pass an IQ test to be in the Senate\" and then looks mortified as he realises what Maher has just got him to say on camera. (The lawsuits, incidentally, are already coming thick and fast.)</p> <p>There are a few genuinely interesting voices in the film, like the Vatican priest who thinks a lot of the Old Testament is hokum, or Francis Collins, the former director of the Human Genome Project and a devout Christian. But there is little room among Religulous' broad satirical sideswipes for these more nuanced, intelligent viewpoints. Cut instead to the cannabis-worshiper in Amsterdam getting a short, sharp dose of paranoia: \"Hey, your hair is on fire!\" Or the anti-Zionist Orthodox Jew, who is friendly with Ahmadinejad. Or an extended sequence at The Holy Land Experience, a theme park in Florida whose daily crucifixions are, inevitably, a sell-out.</p> <p>Ultimately, though, I worry that the film's message is unlikely to get through to the people who really should hear it: the po-faced rightwing Christians who still believe God Loves America and vote accordingly. If those people do go to Religulous, it will be to picket outside, and that's a shame because I think Maher and Charles might have the right idea. Comedy appeals first and foremost to the inquiring mind, and if their film encourages people to engage their brains while they're choking back tears of laughter, it can only be to the good.</p> <p>The problem is, when you see former teen idol Kirk Cameron earnestly telling his fellow Christians to \"bypass their intellect\", you realise that for some people, religious ideology and a sense of humour will always be diametrically opposed. If there is an End of Days somewhere on the horizon, it's not hard to believe that its perpetrators will be the sort of people who find nothing to laugh about in Religulous.</p>",
  "<p>The momentum of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>'s presidential campaign has penetrated Republican heartlands and led to a growing number of once-safe red states being considered winnable.</p> <p>Obama's legions of volunteers and campaign staff have made deep inroads in North Dakota and Missouri - states that have not voted to put a Democrat in the White House since 1964 and 1996 respectively.</p> <p>Polling in North Dakota, a sparsely populated prairie state with a rugged frontier conservatism, puts Obama in a dead heat with his Republican rival, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>.</p> <p>In Missouri - a much older state with large metropolitan areas around St Louis and Kansas City and a rural white conservative base - Obama has edged ahead of McCain in seven out of 10 major polls since early October. The most recent, released yesterday by Fox/Rasmussen, shows him at 49% to McCain's 44%.</p> <p>Should Obama's lead in Missouri and North Dakota hold, their combined 14 electoral votes would give Obama a strategic cushion in the electoral college and free up some of his campaign war chest for spending elsewhere. If Obama wins these states he will enter office with a strong national mandate for his policies.</p> <p>\"It's mathematically irrelevant,\" says the liberal blogger and Democratic internet organising pioneer Markos Moulitsas Zuniga of North Dakota. \"But politically it would be huge. It would show Republicans that they aren't safe anywhere, not even in their supposed strongholds.\"</p> <p>Polls indicate Obama has won support for his plans to handle the economic crisis. He has a large advantage over McCain in campaign funds and volunteers, enabling him to buy more advertising, staff the telephones and send people doorknocking for support.</p> <p>In recent weeks, the Obama juggernaut has overwhelmed long-held assumptions about the viability of a Democratic candidate in states like North Dakota, Virginia and North Carolina. In 2000, the Democratic presidential geographical base was limited to the liberal north-east and west coasts, and the traditionally progressive states of the upper mid-west.</p> <p>In 2004, John Kerry lost ground, ceding New Mexico and Iowa to George Bush, and Democrats feared that the Republican party's appeal to culturally conservative voters had crystallised, locking out the Democrats from large swathes of the south and mid-west.</p> <p>Obama won the Democratic nomination in part on a promise to redraw the electoral map with his appeal to young voters, blacks and independents sick of Bush Republicanism. He was aided by efforts of the Democratic party's chairman, Howard Dean, who pledged to revive dormant party organisations in conservative states like Oklahoma.</p> <p>Obama has been helped by his long and bitter primary battle with Hillary Clinton. By the time he staggered over the finish line in June, he had built massive volunteer organisations in Republican states such as North Carolina. Once he had the nomination secured, his campaign redirected these resources to the general election battle with McCain. Democrats registered hundreds of thousands of new voters across the country.</p> <p>At first, the election race seemed to follow the geographic groove cut by Bush and his successive opponents Al Gore and Kerry, with the fiercest battlegrounds in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p> <p>But it soon became clear Obama was competitive in Colorado and New Mexico, where he has maintained a substantial polling lead boosted by his popularity with Hispanic voters. By mid-September, when the US banking system appeared on the verge of collapse, Obama had pulled ahead in Virginia and was pressuring McCain in North Carolina.</p>",
  "<p>As if McCain didn't have enough real adversaries to rail against, he yesterday invoked the \"feminist left\" at a rally in Missouri, describing that shady organisation as the latest persecutor of his vice-presidential pick. </p> <blockquote> <p>My friends, it's remarkable the comments of the feminist left about Sarah Palin. I want to tell you, I am so proud of the way she has energized America. She is a reformer, she is a great leader, she is the most popular governor in America, and I can hardly wait to introduce her to Washington, D.C.</p> </blockquote> <p>I can recall no remarkable words from the \"feminist left\" in recent days, and I have not heard the McCain campaign complain about undue criticism from woman writers. McCain was resorting to an old Nixon trick, invoking an imaginary enemy or support base to rally supporters against them or on their behalf. Meanwhile, parts of the conservative commentariat have come down hard on McCain and Palin.</p> <p>In late September, conservative Kathleen Parker, became one of the first high-profile writers to voice displeasure with Palin. She called on Palin to withdraw from the ticket, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/26/AR2008092603268.html\">writing</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Palin's recent interviews with Charles Gibson, Sean Hannity and now Katie Couric have all revealed an attractive, earnest, confident candidate. Who Is Clearly Out Of Her League.</p> </blockquote> <p>Peggy Noonan <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/article/declarations.html\">wrote</a> Friday: </p> <blockquote> <p><br>We have seen Mrs. Palin on the national stage for seven weeks now, and there is little sign that she has the tools, the equipment, the knowledge or the philosophical grounding one hopes for, and expects, in a holder of high office.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, Gloria Steinem, whom I imagine personifies the \"feminist left\", has published nothing on Palin since a September 4 <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/opinion/la-oe-steinem4-2008sep04,0,1290251.story\">essay</a> in the LA Times which she wrote of Clinton supporters: \"To vote in protest for McCain/Palin would be like saying, 'Somebody stole my shoes, so I'll amputate my legs.'\"</p>",
  "<p>Depending on which side of the Atlantic you sit, the plumber is either a hero of the working class or a foreign vermin from some faraway place like Poland. He makes for a convenient metaphor that taps into undercurrents of nationalism, patriotism and, in some cases, xenophobia that candidates love to exploit for cheap political gain.</p> <p>In the US, the thinking goes, plumbers represent the best of our country, just below the troops on the pecking order of flag-waving patriots. That was John McCain's point when he appealed to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/17/uselections2008-johnmccain\">Joe the Plumber</a> (aka Joe Wurzelbacher from Holland, Ohio) during last week's presidential debate. And Wurzelbacher - a gruff, bald, Mr Clean look-a-like who probably watches sports on weekends and enjoys a six-pack now and then - certainly looks the part.</p> <p>But the reality, of course, is different. (After all, <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gJsPHiQlgYvAsrHz9mvHJlezQJLwD93RONUO0\">Wurzelbacher does not even hold a plumbing license</a>.) Most plumbers, while still middle class - and who doesn't <a href=\"http://pewresearch.org/pubs/793/inside-the-middle-class\">consider themselves middle class</a> in America - make a decent living. The <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes472152.htm\">average salary of a licensed plumber</a> is just under $50,000, according to the US department of labour. An Irish-American friend of mine, whose father is a self-employed plumber, lives in a pretty lavish house in a leafy suburb of Boston. They need tax relief, sure, but they are hardly at the bottom of the economic barrel.</p> <p>Yet in Europe, plumbers are seen as just the opposite: working-class villains with funny Slavic accents who sleep on subway platforms and work for low wages, all while soaking up western Europe's generous social benefits. They serve as useful scapegoats for politicians looking to tap into the nativist backlash against cheap labour flowing in from Eastern Europe. If you are an unemployed Frenchman without a college degree, a Polish plumber is Public Enemy Number One. (Funny, nobody seems to mind the Eastern European models flooding the runways of Paris or Milan.) </p> <p>Europe's plumber phobia came to the fore in 2005, ahead of France's vote for the EU constitution. Phillippe de Villiers of the right-wing Movement for France party was whipping up popular sentiment against a measure - the Bolkestein directive - that would allow for the easier flow of services within Europe. He warned that the proposal would \"permit a Polish plumber to come to work in France with a salary and social protection of his country of origin.\" In response, the Polish tourism board <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/06/26/news/poland.php\">launched an ad spoofing their plumbers</a> as buff Chippendale's-like models with bleached-blond hair and green overalls.</p> <p>The spat ignored the fact that several EU states are in dire need of manual labour. Roughly <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/05/31/business/workcol.php\">250,000 jobs in blue-collar fields like gardening and carpentry go vacant each year</a>, according to the International Herald Tribune - which is why on a recent visit to Poland, <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/05/28/europe/france.php\">Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, announced a proposal to ease restrictions against Eastern European workers</a> moving to France. But the move may be in vain. After all, Polish plumbers are no longer struggling to find work in Poland, given their country's economic upswing, and many who moved to places like the UK are returning home. </p> <p>All of which goes to show the silliness of the plumber-as-political-mascot strategy. Invoking the profession as a metaphor for all that is holy or wicked in the world is a cheap and dishonest ploy by politicians to connect with working-class voters, at the expense of distorting the economic realities on the ground. John McCain no more understands the wishes of an Ohio plumber than Barack Obama - neither of whom can say they break bread with plumbers on a regular basis. De Villiers cannot say with a straight face that Polish plumbers, much less \"Latvian masons\" or \"Estonian gardeners\", are going to rob Frenchmen of their menial work. In both cases, plumbers serve merely as campaign fodder for slick ads and soundbites. They serve to dumb down discussions of serious issues like tax policy or labour migration laws. </p> <p>A plumber is just that - one of about a million professions whose composition is a mirror of one tiny segment of America or Europe. Like Mario or Luigi from the Mario Bros video game, they are no more honest or virtuous than any of us, but just go about their business, un-gunking our kitchen sinks, while at times incurring the wrath of white-collar workers who complain they are overpaid. Lower their taxes, let them move about the continent - do what you want. Just don't hold them up as political props.</p>",

  "<p>I didn't really have a horse in the Boston-Tampa series, and I don't watch baseball until the playoffs. So Sunday night was the first time I saw David Price in action. The rookie Tampa Bay Rays relief pitcher got his team out of a jam, striking out Jason Varitek among other accomplishments, and preserving TB's victory and ascent to the World Series against Philly.</p> <p>As I watched Price, I thought: This guy is the Obama of baseball. He's young, gamine, in a light-skinned black man (might even be bi-racial), \"inexperienced,\" but cool as an ice cube under pressure.</p> <p>Then lo and behold, what happened yesterday? Obama had an event in Tampa where <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/sports/stories/other/10/21/1021davidprice.html\">he was introduced by...David Price!</a> Life's always interesting.<br></p>",
  "<p>We've got some <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/21/uselections2008-barackobama3\">really sick people</a> in this country.

So there's racism against <em>animals?</em> I'm keeping my cat indoors til election day, I can tell you that.</p> <p>In the meantime, it's the Republicans who'd better worry about these things. Too much of this kind of stuff between now and November 4 will turn decent peoples' stomachs.<br></p>",
  "<p>This kind of polling actually tells us more at this stage of the game than national poll. From <a href=\"http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=1E966732-18FE-70B2-A86E390CE440E9C4\">the Politico today</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Voters in Reno, Nevada's Washoe County prefer Obama over Sen. John<br>McCain by a double-digit margin, 50 percent to 40 percent. A previous<br>Politico/Insider Advantage survey, taken October 9, showed the race<br>deadlocked in Washoe with Obama ahead of McCain, 46 percent to 45<br>percent.</p> <p>In Wake County, N.C., home to Raleigh and its suburbs, Obama leads<br>McCain by nine points, 52 percent to 43 percent. As in Washoe, this new<br>result represents a turn toward the Democratic nominee: Politico's last<br>survey of Wake County Oct. 9 had Obama on top by six points, 50 percent<br>to 44 percent.</p> <p>President George W. Bush won both these counties in 2000 and 2004. In<br>his second presidential bid, Bush won Wake by a thin, 51 percent to 49<br>percent margin, and bested Sen. John F. Kerry in Washoe, 51 percent to<br>47 percent. As the second-most populous counties in their respective<br>states, Wake and Washoe are critical to McCain's chances.</p> </blockquote> <p>In other words, the most populous counties, the homes respectively to Las Vegas and Raleigh, will be Obama counties, and McCain will take the rural areas. So how these second-tier urban/suburban/exurban counties go may well decide how the states go.<br></p>",
  "<p>CNN's John King was <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/20/mccain-camp-looking-for-way-to-win-without-colorado/\">reporting this fascinating news</a> last night:</p> <blockquote> <p>(CNN) \u2014 The McCain campaign is looking at an Electoral College strategy heading into the final two weeks that has virtually no room for error and depends heavily on a dramatic comeback in Pennsylvania, which hasn't backed a Republican for president in 20 years.</p> <p>While Iowa, New Mexico and Colorado are still officially listed as McCain target states, two top strategists and advisers tell CNN that the situation in those states looks increasingly bleak. Iowa and New Mexico always have been viewed as difficult races, but the similar assessment of Colorado reflects a dramatic shift for a campaign that had long counted on the state.</p> <p>\"Gone,\" was the word one top McCain insider used to describe those three states.</p> </blockquote> <p>I've been writing, as my attentive readers know, that Iowa and New Mexico are looking pretty blue-ish. But I haven't been saying that about Colorado. If one assumes it is blue as well, that changes the math/maths a lot. Consider.</p> <p>Again, start from the presumption that Obama will win all the states Kerry won in 2004, which is today a reasonable presumption. That's 252 EV's. Iowa (7) and New Mexico (5) take him to 264. Colorado (9) takes him to 273 and makes him president (270 wins it).</p> <p>So, if you're in the McCain camp and you think the three states in question are gonzo, what do you do? You <em>have </em>to look for a blue state to pick off. Given that it makes sense to aim at Pennsylvania. It has 21 EV's. McCain is behind there now by double-digit margins, but if he can somehow swipe it away, then Obama's path to 270 gets a lot more complicated.</p> <p>Now, the interesting part. The implication of focusing on Pennsylvania means that McCain is going to focus on arguments that he thinks will be especially suited for Pennsylvania, right? Since it's heavily working class and partly Appalachian and quite rural, this may mean more Ayers, more socialism -- and it may mean the reintroduction of Rev. Wright, which McCain said he wouldn't use. And a lot of it will probably be last-minute and/or under the radar.</p> <p>The Obama people need to persuade the Clintons to spend the last week of the campaign in the state to keep it nailed down. I have seen 12-point leads dissipate in two weeks.<br></p>",

  "<p>Barack Obama's lead over John McCain has widened to eight points a fortnight before the US presidential election, according to the latest poll today.</p> <p>The Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby telephone tracking poll put Obama on 50% and McCain on 42%.</p> <p>It is the first time Obama has stretched his advantage over McCain to more than six points since the tracking poll began more than two weeks ago.</p> <p>The pollster John Zogby said: \"Things clearly are moving in Obama's direction.\"</p> <p>The poll found growing support for Obama among a number of key groups, including Republicans, in the wake of an endorsement from the former Republican secretary of state Colin Powell.</p> <p>Polling took place between Saturday and Monday. Powell announced his support for Obama on Sunday morning. </p> <p>\"Maybe this is the Powell effect. That wasn't just an endorsement, that was a pretty powerful statement,\" said Zogby.</p> <p>His support among Republicans has increased from 9% to 12%. Among independent voters he has opened up a 15% lead. </p> <p>Obama told NBC television yesterday that Powell was welcome to campaign for him and might have a place in his administration. He said Powell \"will have a role as one of my advisers\" and that a formal role in his government was \"something we'd have to discuss\".</p> <p>A poll released yesterday for CNN-Opinion Research Corp conducted between Friday and Sunday showed Obama's lead had narrowed to six points, 49-43. </p> <p>Its previous poll gave Obama an 11-point margin. </p> <p>Obama is currently campaigning in Florida, which voted for George Bush in the last two elections. </p> <p>On Thursday and Friday he is due to suspend his campaign to fly to Hawaii to visit his seriously ill grandmother.</p> <p>McCain spent yesterday campaigning in Missouri, which has voted for the winning candidate in every election bar one since 1900.</p>",
  "<p>The barbs, darts and retorts may come to a halt for a few days this week, as Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/21/barack-obama-campaign-grandmother-illness\">returns to Hawaii to visit his grandmother</a>, who is reported to be seriously ill. Madelyn Dunham, 86, helped raise the young Obama after his father abandoned the family and while his mother was busy with her studies and her career. The campaign has cancelled Thursday rallies in Madison, Wisconsin and Des Moines, Iowa, but will hold an event in Indianapolis before Obama flies to Hawaii. He returns to the campaign trail Saturday.</p> <p>Before Obama spokesman and strategist Robert Gibbs broke the news about Obama's granny, Democrats were treated to the sight of their candidate onstage with his erstwhile rival Hillary Clinton in Orlando. As Richard Luscombe writes on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com\">theguardian.com</a>, Clinton urged her supporters: \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/21/obama-clinton-florida-democrat-election\">If you knocked on doors for me, knock on doors for Barack</a>. If you made calls for me, make them for Barack.\"</p> <p>Obama, who beat Clinton to win the Democratic nomination in June after a blistering 16-month campaign, praised her and said: \"I'm proud to call her my friend\".</p> <p>The McCain campaign, meanwhile, is running short of money. A day after Obama announced he had raised a record-breaking $150m in September, McCain revealed in public campaign finance filings that he has only $54m remaining for the two weeks until election day. That may sound flush, but McCain must now play defence in several states once thought safely Republican. Ewen MacAskill writes that the funding disparity will mean that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/21/barack-obama-campaign-grandmother-illness\">McCain's options are much narrower than Obama's</a>, forcing him to target the money more carefully on key states.</p> <p>As the future looks increasingly bleak for the McCain camp, evangelical Christians, an important part of the Republican base, are pondering what may be their exile in the wilderness come election day. From Colorado Springs, Colorado, Suzanne Goldenberg writes in today's Guardian that the prospect of an Obama victory <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/21/uselections2008-barackobama\">represents sheer calamity to conservative Christian leaders</a>, while a number of evangelical leaders have also begun asking whether their movement has drifted too far to the right</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama is in Florida while Biden campaigns in Colorado. McCain holds three rallies in Pennsylvania, while Palin campaigns in Nevada. Expect McCain and Palin to continue to throw around the word \"Obama\" and \"socialism\" and in the same sentence, in an attempt to scare voters away from the Democratic ticket.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Gallup's daily tracking poll shows Obama's lead has rebounded to 11 points, giving him 52% to McCain's 41%. The result indicates that McCain's \"Joe the Plumber\" theme has not won him fresh support. Meanwhile, Obama continues to surge in once-safe Republican states. A Suffolk University poll shows the two candidates in a statistical tie in Missouri, which has not voted Democratic since 1996.</p> <h2>On <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com\">theguardian.com</a> now</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/21/obama-clinton-florida\">Video: Hillary Clinton - 'Work as hard for Barack as you did for me'</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/20/uselections2008-barackobama\"> Road trip video: 'Obama is a liar' - gun owners sound off</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/20/us-elections-first-time-voter\">Truth booth: first-time voter Candice Sena - 'It's our generation who will pay'</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/20/uselections2008-sarahpalin\">Michael Tomasky: How John McCain picked Sarah Palin</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/oct/21/comedy-sarahpalin\">Ed Pilkington: The Feylin phenomenon</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/quiz/2008/oct/21/sarah-palin-tina-fey\">Quiz: Feylin or Palin?</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/opinion/kamiya/2008/10/21/taxes/\">Salon.com: Joe the Plumber's brother is mad as hell</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/20/AR2008102002292.html\">Washington Post: Republicans party like it's 1964</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theweek.com/article/index/89946/3/Dont_go_wobbly_Dems\">The Week: Don't go wobbly, Dems</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,585119,00.html\">Der Spiegel: Why Europeans love Obama</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122455099434052597.html\">Wall Street Journal: Get ready for the new New Deal</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/horseraceblog/2008/10/the_state_of_the_race_1.html\">Real Clear Politics: The state of the race</a></p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"These attacks, like John McCain and Sarah Palin using terms like 'socialism,' I mean, it's like they're running a campaign in 1955.\" Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton.</p> <p>\"John's been there and he's met a little tougher people in his life than the liberal media,\" McCain supporter Senator Lindsey Graham, alluding to McCain's years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>10:35am:</strong> The title doesn't sound exciting. The Commons business and enterprise committee is taking evidence on the \"departmental annual report\" and the \"current economic situation\". </p> <p>But it's Peter Mandelson's first formal appearance before MPs in his new job and so they're likely to ask him about pretty much anything. Well, maybe not everything. In the light of <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4982255.ece\">today's allegations in the Times,</a> the Tories may keep quiet about Oleg Deripaska. But flexible working and the future of the Post Office are almost certain to come up.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>10:38am:</strong> I see the order paper has got him down as Lord Mandelson of Foy and Hartlepool. As <a href=\"http://lordsoftheblog.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/its-lord-mandelson/\">Lord Norton</a> explained last week, that's wrong. It should just be Lord Mandelson, or Lord Mandelson, of Foy and Hartlepool. Read Norton. He'll tell you why the comma is important.</p> <p>Mandelson is here. He introduces himself as Peter Mandelson. And the chairman, the Tory MP Peter Luff, wishes him happy birthday.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>10:39am:</strong> Luff says he wants to cover three areas: <br>1) the machinery of government changes <br>2) the recession - \"I think we're allowed to use that word now\", Luff says <br>3) and the Post Office and flexible working.</p> <p>Luff says that when Mandelson went to Brussels, the bookies were offering odds of 3-1 on him leaving before his time was up.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>10:42am:</strong> Mandelson ducks the question, but he does want to comment on the Post Office and flexible working. He says that the quotes in the FT were not based on anything he had said to them in the last 72 hours. And he did not speak to the Independent (that covered the flexible working story). The way the story was presented owed more to the imagination of the subs, he claims, than to the intention of the reporter (Andrew Grice).</p> <p>Pressed on the FT, he says the quotes came from a \"casual conversation\" he had with an FT journalist after his appointment. But he did not find the report \"alarming\".</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>10:43am:</strong> Luff says he does not want to get distracted by the \"excitable\" stories in the press. I think that's a reference to Deripaska. Luff says the Lords register of interests goes back three years. Does that mean that Mandelson will have to declare relevant interests going back three years?</p> <p>Mandelson says he doesn't know. But he stressed that, when he was a European commissioner, he was covered by a code of conduct.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>10:46am:</strong> <strong>Energy</strong></p> <p>Luff asks if he thinks it sensible for the department - he says his committee still prefers to think of it as the Department for Trade and Industry - to lose responsibility for energy.</p> <p>Mandelson says he thinks it makes sense for energy to be in a new department with climate change. He's meeting Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, later today for their first bilateral about how the two departments will work together.</p> <p>Britain is in a good position to be a market leader in climate change technology.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>10:51am:</strong> Britain is in a good position to be a market leader in climate change technology.</p> <p>Michael Clapham, Labour, asks how many staff the department will lose to the new energy department. And how much of it's budget will go.</p> <p>Mandelson says 520 staff will transfer from DBERR (Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform - Mandelson's department) to Decc (the Department for Energy and Climate Change - I haven't heard that acronym before). Decc will also get \u00a335m for administration, compared to DBERR's \u00a3297m.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>10:58am:</strong> Asked what he will bring to the department, Mandelson talks about the \"experience and knowledge\" that he has gained.</p> <p>Mark Oaten, Lib Dem, asks if there were any European regulations that worked against British interests.</p> <p>\"I don't think so,\" says Mandelson. But he says he shared with the British government concerns about directives like the agency workers directive.</p> <p>Luff asks if Mandelson is happy about the department no longer having responsibility for science.</p> <p>Mandelson says Luff is asking about decisions \"way above my pay grade\". Luff replies: \"There's nothing way above your pay grade\".</p> <p>On the question, Mandelson says that if he had been around when responsibility for science was taken away from the department, and given instead to John Denham's innovation department, he would have argued against it. But he can see the logic for science being placed alongside higher education.</p> <p>But \"we are where we are,\" he says. \"It has been agreed - decided, rather\" - a nice Mandelson line. He admires decisive prime ministers.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>11:01am:</strong> Luff says he's running a department that is now \"a shadow of its former self\". He's lost science and energy. But he's still in charge of anti-corruption, although the officials dealing with anti-corruption report to Jack Straw, the justice secretary, who was named last week as the government's anti-corruption champion. Why's that?, asks Luff.</p> <p>Good question. The assumption at Westmister was that Straw was given the job because giving it to Mandelson would have given the press an incentive to bang on about his two resignations.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>11:05am:</strong> Mandelson says that, before John Hutton had the anti-corruption job, it was held by Hilary Benn (when he was international development secretary, I presume).</p> <p>Mandelson stresses that he thinks Britain has a very good anti-corruption record. Luff says he is still \"puzzled\" why the officials dealing with this report to the permanent secretary in their department, but not to their secretary of state, but he does not press the point - or ask directly about Mandelson's two previous resignations.</p> <p>Mandelson wants to mention his action programme for the economy. Luff asks him to wait until they get onto the economy.</p> <p>Brian Binley, Conservative, asks about Mandelson's relationship with Gordon Brown. This should get interesting. He quotes Mandelson as saying that David Cameron had been \"swinging around like a pendulum\". Isn't that what Mandelson has been doing in his relations with Brown and Tony Blair?</p> <p>Mandelson quibbles about what he actually said. Luff - correctly - suggests he's playing for time.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>11:09am:</strong> On the main point, he says that his allegiance has always been to New Labour. He's always been \"rock-solid\" in that respect. \"I'm not for budging.\"</p> <p><strong>America</strong></p> <p>Julie Kirkbride, Conservative, asks if Mandelson is worried about the US turning protectionist after the presidential election.</p> <p>Mandelson says he is concerned about this. He has been \"encouraged\" by what John McCain has said about his commitment to open markets and free trade. </p> <p>And he's been \"encouraged\" by what Barack Obama has said \"more recently\" on this subject, although earlier Obama and Hillary Clinton were competing for the protectionist, blue-collar vote. He hopes that, whoever wins, the US will continue to embrace free trade.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>11:12am:</strong> It's a very diplomatic answer. He came close to criticising the Democrats, but without actually doing so.</p> <p>Kirkbride presses him on this. Wouldn't it be worse under the Democrats? Mandelson doesn't accept this.</p> <p>Luff says the committee will return to this at a later stage, perhaps with an inquiry.</p> <p><strong>Accountability to parliament<br></strong><br>Luff asks if Mandelson is adequately accountable to the House of Commons.</p> <p>\"If you feel unhappy about my accountability, then that would worry me,\" Mandelson replies. He wants to maintain his accountability to the Commons through this committee. He describes them as his \"principal Commons masters\".</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>11:15am:</strong> He might have to see them more often than a normal cabinet minister to ensure accountability. This sounds quite flattering - which will probably go down well.</p> <p>Luff isn't easily put off. He says that, of the six ministers in the department, Mandelson and another two - Lady Vadera and Stephen Carter - are in the Lords. And of the three Commons ministers, two of them are shared with other departments: Gareth Thomas, who also works for international development, and Ian Pearson, who also works for the Treasury. The only DBERR minister in the Commons working solely for the department is Pat McFadden. Luff says he's concerned about this.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>11:18am:</strong> Mandelson says these weren't his decisions.</p> <p>Gareth Thomas will be travelling a lot, as a Dfid minister, Luff says. And Pearson is taking Treasury legislation through the Commons.</p> <p>Lindsay Hoyle, Labour, says that these two are \"part-time ministers\". There should be a full-time minister of state answerable to the Commons.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>11:24am:</strong> Mandelson defends \"sharing\" ministers. He says that when he was last at the (then) DTI, it did not cooperate with the culture department as well as it should have done. Carter will be able to \"straddle\" the two departments, as he did when he launched an initiative on digital technology at the end of last week.</p> <p>Mark Oaten says all MPs have got small business issues that they want to take up with a minister. But they can't take it up with the small business minister (Vadera) because she's in the Lords.</p> <p>Mandelson says he has not detected any unhappiness amongst business about the arrangements. Referring to Vadera, he says he has never thought of her as being \"hidden away\". (She is famously forthright.)</p> <p>Luff says that Alan Duncan, the shadow business secretary, has written to the committee asking to give evidence about Mandelson's lack of accountability.</p> <p>Mandelson floats the idea of changing Commons rules to allow him to appear at the dispatch box to be questioned by MPs. But he's straying \"beyond his comfort zone\", he says. It's an idea that Commons reformers have floated before, but it's hard to tell whether Mandelson is serious about it.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>11:34am:</strong> Clapham asks whether the proceeds of the sale of the government's stake in British Energy (to EDF) will go into the nuclear liabilities fund (NLF). The sale raised \u00a312.5bn, and the government's stake was worth 35%. Mandelson and his permanent secretary, Sir Brian Bender, confirm that the money will go into the NLF.</p> <p>Luff points out that there is not a select committee overseeing the work of the new Department for Energy and Climate Change. His committee will do the job in the meantime.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>11:37am:</strong> <strong>The economy</strong></p> <p>Mandelson defends the decision to set up at national economic council. (It replaced another cabinet committee, and some critics said the innovation was cosmetic one, merely the renaming of a committee that already existed.) Mandelson says having the prime minister chairing the council, and having it meet twice a week has made it effective.</p> <p>Roger Berry, Labour, asks if the department was involved in the negotiations with the banks on the bail-out plan. Mandelson says Vadera was heavily involved.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>11:43am:</strong> Bender says that permanent secretaries from various departments were involved in regular meetings with the Treasury before the summer about the economic crisis.</p> <p>Luff says the national economic council is \"just another cabinet sub-committee\". It's \"hardly a great solution to all our problems\".</p> <p>Mandelson rejects this. If Luff were to attend, he would not say that.</p> <p>So Mandelson thinks it has a different quality?</p> <p>\"I really do,\" says Mandelson. \"I think it's qualitatively quite different in its focus, in its urgency [and in the way other ministers are put on the spot].\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>11:48am:</strong> Banks</p> <p>Mike Weir, SNP, asks if there will be enough competition in the banking sector following the Lloyds TSB/HBOS merger.</p> <p>Mandelson says he's always a \"hawk\" on competition issues. The OFT is producing two reports on the proposed merger, one relating to competition and the other relating to financial stability. They are due at the end of this week.</p> <p>Weir says the takeover was planned before the bank bail-out plan was launched. There are now suggestions that, following recapitalisation, HBOS could survive on its own. Could this happen?</p> <p>Mandelson says the government does not expect this to happen; the merger is due to go ahead.</p> <p>But could the two banks still get the money if the merged did not go ahead, Weir asks.</p> <p>Mandelson says the recapitalisation is predicated on the merger going ahead. He has not heard any suggestions from the two banks that they don't want the merger to go ahead.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>11:52am:</strong> This is a big issue in Scotland. <a href=\"http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/latestnews/Why-a-Lloyds-TSB-takeover.4611246.jp\">The Scotsman</a> today has published an open letter to the OFT, calling for the merger to be blocked on the grounds that it would have a damaging effect on Scottish businesses and customers.</p> <p>Weir asks about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/21/lloydstsbgroup-executivesalaries\">Guardian report saying that Lloyds TSB staff will still get their bonuses</a>. Mandelson says he's \"behind the curve\" on this story. He has not read the Guardian report. But he thinks it is an issue that the Treasury will want to take up.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>11:58am:</strong> Julie Kirkbride, Conservative, says that when the merger plans were first drawn up, there were provisions to protect jobs in Scotland, but not in Halifax. Is that fair?</p> <p>Mandelson says she's making an assumption. \"It was in the document,\" Kirkbride says. (She was brought up in Halifax.) Mandelson does not address this, but says that he expects the regional development agencies in places such as Yorkshire to get involved in ensuring that jobs are not lost.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>12:03pm:</strong> In response to another question, Mandelson says credit rating agencies need to \"polish up their act\".</p> <p><strong>Small businesses</strong></p> <p>Binley says the banks have had \"billions and billions\" of taxpayers' money. Will Mandelson ensure that they take steps to help small businesses?</p> <p>Yes, says Mandelson. He's meeting bank bosses with the chancellor, Alistair Darling, on Thursday to discuss this.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>12:06pm:</strong> Cash flow is an important issue for banks. Central government has already said it will pay its invoices to small businesses within 10 days. Mandelson \"announces\" (although it has already been briefed) that Hazel Blears, the communities secretary, and Alan Johnson, the health secretary, will be writing to councils and NHS trusts to ensure that they do the same.</p> <p>There have been proposals relating to VAT and national insurance, he says, referring to the plans floated by the Conservatives. He criticises both plans: the national insurance cut would be funded by a tax on other businesses (because the Tories would fund it by cutting reliefs) and the VAT holiday idea would result in small businesses accumulating bigger bills to pay in the future.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>12:09pm:</strong> Mandelson also addresses the issue of access to credit. As part of the bail-out package, banks have to lend at 2007 levels to small and medium-sized businesses. Mandelson says that in practice this means that they will have to have access to capital if they need it.</p> <p>The government will monitor how the banks are performing in this area. And it will make sure that these policies are pursued \"at branch level\".</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>12:15pm:</strong> Binley says banks need quick decisions.</p> <p>Mandelson says the government also wants \"care and sensitivity\" from the revenue authorities. His officials have already raised this with Revenue &amp; Customs, which, he says, already has a policy of \"flexibility\" when it comes to dealing with tax payments from small businesses.</p> <p>Oaten asks Mandelson if he can make the government procurement process easier for small businesses. And Hoyle asks if there is any scope for giving firms more time to pay their business rates.</p> <p>Mandelson says the chancellor is \"very mindful\" of the need to bring forward capital projects to inject more money into the economy. And a review is already under way into government procurement and small businesses.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>12:20pm:</strong> <strong>Flexible working</strong></p> <p>Adrian Bailey, Labour, asks about an article in the FT this morning saying there has been a \"furious backlash\" to the proposal to shelve the implementation of more flexible working.</p> <p>\"This very fierce backlash hasn't reached me yet,\" Mandelson says. \"And my telephone number's in the book.\" (I'm not sure that it is, but never mind.)</p> <p>But he says he did hear a TUC official discuss the proposal on the Today programme this morning. (I can't remember her name, but she was opposed to delaying implementation of the flexible working proposals.)</p> <p>Mandelson says that agreeing to look at something is not the same as agreeing to do it. It is \"not the case\" that he has come to a decision.</p> <p>He welcomes the views expressed by the TUC, just as he welcomes the views of employer organisations.</p> <p>But it is not a foregone conclusions that he will reach one view or another, he goes on.</p> <p>I'm not sure that clears things up much at all. Or is there a third way?</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>12:25pm:</strong> But Bailey seems satisfied. He's moving onto a different question, relating to the assessment of regulatory burdens.</p> <p>Mandelson says the regulatory impact assessment of flexible working shows a cost to business of \u00a369m, but a gain to business worth \u00a391m (through greater flexibility). He seems to be referring to extending the \"right to request\" flexible working for parents of children up to the age of 16 - the proposals due to come into force next year.</p> <p>This is significant. It suggests the proposals won't be shelved.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>12:28pm:</strong> <strong>Post Office</strong></p> <p>Hoyle says he hopes that Royal Mail remains. Is Mandelson going to renegotiate the universal service delivery provisions.</p> <p>Mandelson says the biggest problems the Royal Mail faces are the fall in the volume of post, and the \"ballooning\" size of its pensions liabilities.</p> <p>Customers are moving away from the post. Market conditions for all postal operators are \"challenging\". That's why a review was set up under Richard Hooper. \"I believe that initiial findings present a rather stark picture of conditions in the postal market.\"</p> <p>He does not want to be drawn on premature responses or conclusions. There is no timetable for the review. But he may ask Hooper to widen it, to include other factors.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>12:33pm:</strong> But he remains \"strongly committed to the Royal Mail. What we want to see is it being efficient, modernised, viable.\"</p> <p>(But he doesn't include \"publicly-owned\" in this list of adjectives.)</p> <p>Hoyle asks if Mandelson will use procurement policies to support British industry.</p> <p>Mandelson says that when he was a European commissioner he insisted on being driven around Brussels in a British-made Jaguar.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>12:36pm:</strong> Luff winds up. But he says he's \"confused\" about Mandelson's position on the Royal Mail. He suggests that Mandelson has \"disavowed\" the FT story about Royal Mail part-privatisation.</p> <p>But Mandelson didn't disavow that, as he says himself.</p> <p>Now he's off. He's got to catch a train at 1pm.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>12:45pm:</strong> <strong>Instant summary</strong></p> <p><strong>Flexible working:</strong> Mandelson confirmed that he is reviewing plans to extend flexible working rules next year, but he stressed that he had not taken any decisions, and he criticised the way his intentions were reported in the Independent yesterday. But he also made a point of quoting figures about the way the provisions could help businesses, which I took as a clear hint that the reforms will not be shelved.</p> <p><strong>Royal Mail:</strong> Mandelson also tried to distance himself from the report in yesterday's FT saying that he was in favour of the part-privatisation of the Royal Mail. But he did not deny the quotes attributed to him, or the comments in the paper saying he \"remains inclined towards a greater role for the private sector in the Royal Mail\". </p> <p>He also said that the ongoing Hooper review of postal services was going to present a \"rather stark picture\" of prospects in the industry and that he could widen its scope. Although he stressed his commitment to Royal Mail, he did not mention his commitment to it being \"publicly-owned\". I expect the unions will find this troubling.</p> <p><strong>Small businesses:</strong> Mandelson confirmed that the order requiring government departments to pay small businesses within 10 days of being billed will be extended to local authorities and NHS trusts. He also said he and the chancellor, Alistair Darling, would be meeting bank chiefs on Thursday to make sure they honoured their obligations to lend to small businesses.</p> <p><strong>Appearing in the Commons:</strong> Mandelson did concede that there's a case for cabinet ministers who sit in the Lords being required to appear in the Commons. If that were to happen, it would be a significant constitutional innovation.</p> <p><strong>Part-time ministers:</strong> Even Labour MPs on the committee were unhappy about the fact that the business department has six ministers, of whom only one - Pat McFadden - sits in the Commons and does not have responsibilities to other departments.</p> <p><strong>Anti-corruption unit:</strong> It was reported last week that Mandelson had \"lost\" the post of anti-corruption champion that was held by his predecessor. But I didn't realise that the officials dealing with this still all sit in his department. Mandelson couldn't offer a good explanation for this.</p>",
  "<p>By the end of this week, if you are visiting Liverpool you will be able to ride into town on a train bearing the name of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/johnpeel\">John Peel</a>. And if you happen to be listening to one of the late DJ's favourite songs \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GreJkc8SkZc\">Amsterdam's Does This Train Stop on Merseyside?</a> \u2013 well, the answer will be yes.</p> <p>The train is intended as a lasting memorial for Peel, who grew up in the area. \"We are very proud of the man John was and of his connection with Merseyside,\" councillor Mark Dowd, chair of Merseytravel, said in a press release.</p> <p>The train will be inaugurated at around 3pm on Thursday, leaving Merseytravel's Liverpool South Parkway station. Sheila Ravenscroft, Peel's wife, will be present for a ceremony and will travel on the train's first journey to Liverpool. \"We are just really delighted that John is being honoured with this train,\" Ravenscroft said. \"He would have loved it!\"</p> <p>The train's inauguration comes just two days before the fourth anniversary of Peel's death. </p> <p>\"Having Sheila with us to launch the train makes it that extra bit special,\" said Neil Scales, Merseytravel's chief executive and director general. \"This train will forever be linked to John, a man whose influence on music was, and to some extent still remains, unparalleled.\"</p> <p>Guests at the event will be treated to a special performance of Does This Train Stop on Merseyside? by Amsterdam's Ian Prowse. The song was cherished by Peel, who once called it his second-favourite track. \"[John] wasn't capable of playing [the song] without crying,\" his wife told BBC Radio 1 in a tribute special. </p> <p>\"If he played it on the radio he'd have to put something on straight afterwards because he wouldn't be able to speak. When he played it at home, he'd always need a cuddle afterwards.\"</p>",
  "<p>The much-improved Heroes is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/ustelevision\">epic, fantastic and grand</a>. It's all bells, whistles, explosions and dramatic, noisy CGI with loud people being astonishing, showily shouting up a storm or travelling in time. </p> <p>Even so, I prefer <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412175/trivia\">Medium</a>, the BBC's other addictive, super-special-ability format show. Our heroine is suburban psychic Allison Dubois. She sees dead people (but doesn't make a fuss) and visions arrive unexpectedly in her dreams, frequently mysterious and bizarre ones at that. </p> <p>Allison the Medium has three kids and her life is restricted, even mundane. Save the cheerleader? No. Pay the mortgage and support your recently unemployed rocket scientist husband by cracking cold cases and revealing conniving or unlikely culprits for DA Manuel Devalos (Miguel Sandoval) alongside sceptical Detective Lee Scanlon (David Cubitt).</p> <p>Leering, cartoon-evil, brain-munching villains and the (somewhat inconvenient) power to kill people at random, are fine, I suppose. But Medium celebrates the home life of superheroes: like seeing Superman darning his tights or Wonderwoman burning a frozen lasagne. The Dubois family struggle for money, and while Allison's teenage daughter is <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=vJQBljC5RIo\">psychic</a> like her mother she is only slightly unsettled by her visions.</p> <p>What is more, the plotlines are pleasingly inventive. A recent episode featuring cannibalism was disconcerting but also intelligently questioning of moral certainties. A group of once imprisoned, now liberated Vietnam vets (a cheeky jibe at McCain, perhaps?) were revealed to have saved their own lives by eating a wounded colleague. Afterwards they vowed to lead lives of exemplary public service, a promise they had honoured. What if they had starved? </p> <p>Medium is warm-hearted and gently amusing, pitched like a telepathic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rockford_Files\">Rockford Files</a>, which is down to the perfect casting. <a href=\"http://www.patriciaarquette.org/\">Patricia Arquette</a> plays Allison and <a href=\"http://www.tv.com/Jake-Weber/person/11326/summary.html\">Jake Weber</a> her kind and supportive husband, both outstanding as \"real people\". <a href=\"http://januarymagazine.com/nonfiction/dontkissthem.html\">It's also based on a \"true\" story</a>, with the real Allison Dubois employed as consultant on the show. The only unrealistic aspect is that the lovely but impecunious Medium never tries to predict the lottery numbers. Hypocrites, liars and poseurs beware: when she touches you, Allison the Medium can see your true nature. That's both useful and terrifying.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338817901\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>They were once bitter rivals in Florida for the Democratic party's presidential nomination. But Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton hugged, kissed and joined forces in Orlando last night to launch a concerted three-day push to win over undecided voters in the key swing state.</p> <p>The two made a rare joint appearance at a public rally attended by an estimated 30,000 wildly enthusiastic supporters to begin a frantic final two weeks of campaigning before the November 4 election.</p> <p>The politician Obama once accused of \"stirring it up\" in Florida, for attending a fundraiser there against an agreement between them not to, was suddenly his new best friend. </p> <p>Introduced to the stage as the \"Iron Lady\", Clinton delivered a forthright endorsement of her one-time opponent's credentials for the White House and urged the voters who swept her to an ultimately meaningless victory in the state's Democratic primary to campaign anew for Obama. \"It's a mad dash for the finish line and we cannot take a single vote for granted,\" she said. \"If you knocked on doors for me, knock on doors for Barack. If you made calls for me, make them for Barack.\"</p> <p>By way of reciprocity, the mutual appreciation continued as Obama took to the podium immediately afterwards to deliver a 30-minute speech tilted strongly towards Florida's legions of working-class voters. He hugged her warmly, thanked her for her support and for introducing him as \"America's next president\", and announced that: \"Hillary Clinton shattered barriers to inspire millions,\" he said. \"I'm proud to call her my friend.\"</p> <p>Hugely popular in Florida, Clinton's presence confirmed Obama's unleashing of his heavy weaponry in a late attempt to seize a state won by George Bush in each of the last two elections.</p> <p>For three days this week, Obama, his wife Michelle, Clinton and senior Democrat Bill Richardson, the New Mexico governor, were due to make at least 20 campaign appearances in the state from Pensacola in the north to Miami in the south.</p> <p>Earlier yesterday, Obama spoke in Tampa as Clinton campaigned in West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale. Tonight, Obama will address voters in Miami, home to a majority of Florida's half million or so Cuban-Americans, who are traditionally Republican-leaning.</p> <p>In Orlando last night, thousands of disappointed supporters remained locked outside as Obama and Clinton swept in for their party's biggest public rally of the campaign in Florida. </p> <p>The Amway Arena is the regular home of the Orlando Magic basketball team, but Obama was casting spells of his own as he worked a keen audience, many of whom had queued since daybreak for a spot near the front.</p> <p>\"I remember watching tapes of Martin Luther King speaking years ago, and Barack Obama is the only one I've heard since who I believe when he says what he says,\" said Marsha Lawson, a 65-year-old grandmother from Winter Park, near Orlando, who arrived at 6am with her two daughters. \"Obama will be good news for us. I was going to vote today, but it can wait until tomorrow. I had to be here.\"</p> <p>With two weeks of early voting already under way in Florida, and opinion polls pointing to a clear Obama lead, Clinton urged supporters not to be complacent. \"We cannot falter, we cannot stop, we cannot take a single vote for granted,\" she said. \"Let's begin our march to take our country back. Now is the time to close the deal on Barack Obama, and close the book on eight years of failed Republican leadership.\"</p> <p>Aside from the cheering hordes, a raft of good news greeted the Democratic candidate as he arrived. Figures released yesterday showed his party has 600,000 more registered voters in Florida than the Republicans, overturning a 370,000 deficit from four years ago. </p> <p>With an overall electorate of more than eight million, it is Florida's undecided voters that Obama is chasing rather than those he knows he has. But it was an encouraging day for the Democrats to hear Erin VanSickle, the Republican state party spokeswoman, admit that: \"Florida is a blue state when it comes to registration.\"</p> <p>Additionally, four of the latest five opinion polls give Obama anything from a two to five-point advantage over Republican rival John McCain in Florida, a lead he has held since only the beginning of this month.</p> <p>As the assembled thousands in the packed open-air arena shouted their approval, Obama delivered a stinging attack on McCain. \"Florida is crying out for change,\" he said. \"I can take two more weeks of John McCain's attacks, but America can't take four more years of failed economic policies.\"</p> <p>The so-called I-4 corridor, named for the east-west motorway through the central Florida heartland from Tampa to Daytona Beach, is rich in working-class votes and the Democrats are sure they can win most of them. Alongside Joe the Plumber live Joe the Theme Park Worker, and Joe the Rocket Engineer, and in the current economic climate many are worried about their jobs.</p> <p>More than 3,500 jobs will be lost at the Kennedy Space Centre at Florida's Cape Canaveral over the next two years as the space shuttle fleet is retired, and Obama hopes a planned extra $2 billion investment in Nasa will ease things for the space agency and its workers. </p> <p>That news was welcomed by a group who call themselves the Obamanauts, a group of workers in the space industry in central and east Florida who are hoping their candidate will bring forward America's plans to resumed manned spaceflight after 2010. \"Obama's plans will help retain the aerospace workforce in Florida and around the country,\" said Tim Bailey, a space education consultant from Titusville and leader of a group that has modified Obama's official campaign logo to give it an intergalactic flavour.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Obama said he was determined to address Florida's unemployment rate, at 6.6 per cent half a point higher than the national average and the worst figure in the state for 14 years. He said he also has his sights set on Florida's soaring rate of repossessions, second only to California in the US.</p> <p>Working class votes from Florida are the key to \"bringing sunshine to Washington,\" Obama told the crowd, while Clinton added that she had devised a new slogan for Florida: \"Jobs, baby, jobs,\" a chant that quickly gained in popularity.</p>",
  "<p>A family emergency interrupted Barack Obama's quest for the presidency yesterday, when the Democratic candidate announced he was leaving the campaign trail to visit his ailing grandmother in Hawaii.</p> <p>A campaign spokesman said Obama's 85-year-old grandmother Madelyn Dunham had taken ill, and described her condition as \"very serious\". The spokesman, Robert Gibbs, said Obama will cancel campaign events later this week to return to Hawaii. He declined to give details of her illness but said it had deteriorated in recent weeks and was serious enough for the Illinois senator to make the more than 10-hour long flight to Honolulu.</p> <p>Dunham, whom Obama as a child called Tutu, Hawaiian for grandparent, helped raise Obama after his father abandoned the family and while his mother was busy with her studies and career. She hails from a small town in Kansas and moved with Obama's grandfather Stanley Dunham and mother to Hawaii in 1959, where his grandfather entered the home furniture business.</p> <p>Gibbs said Dunham \"has always been one of the most important people in [Barack Obama's] life.\"</p> <p>At the Democratic convention in August, Obama said of his grandmother: \"She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me.\"</p> <p>Dunham has not appeared on the campaign trail, and Obama has said she is too frail to travel but follows the campaign on television. In late August, Obama and his family took a brief holiday in Hawaii to visit her. Obama's parents and maternal grandfather are no longer living. His paternal grandmother lives in a village in Kenya.</p> <p>Obama is scheduled to campaign in Florida today and in Virginia on Wednesday. The campaign cancelled Thursday rallies in Madison, Wisconsin and Des Moines, Iowa, but will hold an event in Indianapolis on Thursday before Obama flies to Hawaii. He is scheduled to return to the campaign trail on Saturday.</p> <p>This is not the first time a family emergency has interrupted the Democratic campaign. Vice-presidential candidate Joe Biden's mother-in-law passed away earlier this month, and Biden suspended campaign activity for two days.</p> <p>It is unclear how the time away from the campaign trail will affect the dynamics of the race. Obama leads in polling in Wisconsin and Iowa, and is ahead nationally and in several key battleground states.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday October 21 2008. The Hawaiian word for grandmother is Tutu, not 'Toot' as we had it in the article above. This has been corrected.</p>"
