  "<p>The Israeli president, Shimon Peres, last night formally gave Tzipi Livni, the foreign minister, 42 days to form a coalition government after the resignation on Sunday of the scandal-hit prime minister Ehud Olmert.</p> <p>The announcement was made with a brief ceremony and a handshake at the president's official residence in Jerusalem. \"I agree to take upon myself the role of forming a government,\" Livni said.</p> <p>Livni, 50, who became leader of the ruling Kadima party last week in a narrow internal election victory, has spent the five days since then meeting leaders of political factions she will need to form her government. If she fails to form a coalition in the next six weeks, a general election will probably be held by early next year.</p> <p>Livni has already run into difficulties. Ehud Barak, the leader of the Labour party which had been expected to join a coalition as the second largest party, appears to be hesitating. He delivered a surprise snub to Livni after her election victory by meeting first with the leader of the opposition Likud party, Binyamin Netanyahu, before seeing her on Sunday. Analysts suggest poor relations between Barak and Livni may be to blame. </p> <p>Shas, a party that represents the Sephardic ultra-Orthodox and which has been part of the ruling coalition for the past two years, has also still not decided whether to join Livni. It will almost certainly demand an increase in child allowances to please its large-family constituency, and will look for guarantees from Livni that she will not divide Jerusalem in peace talks with the Palestinians. Such a guarantee would limit her ability to negotiate the peace agreement she has promised she will continue to seek.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown is still agonising over whether to stage a cabinet reshuffle next week because of concerns that it might prove a flashpoint for cabinet resignations.</p> <p>There is also concern that he will show himself to be weak if he does not shift some of those in top-rank jobs. </p> <p>Ministers close to Brown's thinking say a great deal of technical work has been done on the reshuffle, including seeking the opinion of senior civil servants on the performance of individual ministers and the possible establishment of a department for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. </p> <p>But those advising against an imminent reshuffle say it would conflict with Brown's overall message that he is preoccupied with the world economic crisis. He is also being told by some of his closest colleagues that he probably only has one last big reshuffle in him before the next election, and if he wants to refresh his team, it should be a big change, something he may not have the political capital, or urgent need, to undertake now.</p> <p>The most audacious move, discussed by some of his advisers, would be to shift Alistair Darling from the Treasury to the Home Office and make Ed Balls chancellor. The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, would then be asked to run the Department for Children, Schools and Families. </p> <p>However, it is widely thought that after an awkward summer, Alistair Darling has cemented his position as chancellor, performing decisively during the financial crisis and now preparing for some difficult announcements on higher borrowing and lower growth forecasts in the November pre-budget report, figures that will force him to consider tax rises. </p> <p>He is also central to government efforts to agree a new international architecture of financial regulation, including key meetings at the IMF. </p> <p>He is already preparing the ground to announce that he will have to break the sustainable investment rule on borrowing, as a necessary way to minimise the impact of a small recession. </p> <p>But Darling has frustrated some in the cabinet by ruling out direct measures to tackle city executive bonuses, saying he instead wants an FSA-led review of the incentive structure of bonuses. </p> <p>Shifting David Miliband from the Foreign Office, an idea canvassed by some, has dangers in that it might provoke Miliband into resignation, something he has considered in his wilder moments.</p> <p>A good deal of civil service time has been spent considering how to put together a new department for the nations, taking in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, but the failure to reach an agreement between the political parties on devolved policing makes it difficult to disband the Northern Ireland office at this stage. </p> <p>The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, a former Conservative, has risen in Brown's estimation, and he has been considered for a post close to Brown, possibly in the Cabinet Office to advise on medium term strategy, as well as act as a frontman for the party on the media. A former director of communications at the Conservative party under the chairmanship of Lord Patten, Woodward is also prized for his analysis of Conservative strategy.</p> <p>Ruth Kelly, the transport secretary and tipped by some as vulnerable for the sack has denied that she is on the verge of leaving the cabinet in protest at the human fertilisation and embryology bill. </p> <p>One minister insisted Brown should go ahead with a reshuffle only if there is a compelling reason to do so. He said: \"The lesson from Tony Blair's time is that you should only conduct a reshuffle if you have to. If he does not think it through seriously it could weaken rather than strengthen him.\"</p> <p>One minister said it would become clear in the next few months whether Brown could survive as prime minister. \"It may sound corny but it really will be up to the people whether Gordon stays or not. They will make their view known in the [byelection] ballot box at Glenrothes and in opinion polls. </p> <p>\"It is important that Gordon is given a free run for his 'relaunch' and for this conference. If, in the next few months, we're 20 points behind then the people will be speaking and we will note that. If we are, say, nine points behind then Gordon will be making progress.\"</p>",
  "<p>You really don't need a hurricane to knock some common sense into you,\" Reggie Bush says as he describes how he recently began pre-season training in the devastated city he now calls home. In early June the most ambitious young star of American football, and his New Orleans Saints team-mates, \"went on a mission. We went to Holly Grove, a local neighbourhood, and rebuilt five homes that had been lost in Hurricane Katrina in 2005. We dug holes, we painted, we re-landscaped the lawn. I painted a whole house and it was no easy task.</p> <p>\"It was a humbling experience. After three years in a trailer this family went back to a place I'd helped make nice again. That was my reward. Anybody in their right mind, if they had their head screwed on tight, would want to do it.\"</p> <p>Their American counterparts in the NFL might be as lavishly paid, and often just as self-centred, but it is hard to imagine many Premier League footballers agreeing to rebuild some ruined homes for ordinary families. Yet, the way Bush talks, a week on a building site might not be a bad way to inject a little humility and reality into the glittering lives of footballers like Cristiano Ronaldo and Ashley Cole who have previously been compared to slaves.</p> <p>There is also a certain kind of kudos for the returning family - for their house has been painted by a sportsman who has been hailed, bizarrely for Bush himself, as something approaching a deity. \"Reggie Bush is, for want of a better word, a god,\" gushes Rob Callahan, a police chief in Louisiana. \"I don't think anyone here doesn't know what he's doing for hurricane victims.\"</p> <p>The imposing 23-year-old running back is a forceful presence in New Orleans. But, a few weeks ago, Hurricane Gustav threatened to tear down all the good work done by Bush and the Saints. After two million people had been evacuated from New Orleans, the luck of a seemingly cursed city finally changed for the better. Having wreaked the worst of its carnage on Haiti, the Caribbean and Cuba, Gustav hurtled past New Orleans.</p> <p>Yet the fallout from Hurricane Katrina is still felt bitterly - and induces Bush to show some of the muscle that might one day propel him towards a high-flying political career. He clearly already recognises his own considerable clout in America. Apart from being a former runaway winner of the prestigious Heisman Trophy, for the outstanding performer in college football, he became the second-most endorsed player in the NFL in his first season - only trailing the feted quarterback Peyton Manning in 2006. Such status encourages Bush to speak his mind.</p> <p>Reflecting on the abject failure of his presidential namesake, George Bush, to respond to the impoverished and mostly black victims of Katrina, he points out that, \"even now, three years on, people are living in trailers. So whatever the government did is not enough. The sad thing about New Orleans is that there is a lot of corruption in the political arena. It's sad that people have to put up with this. I don't know how most politicians feel - but I feel ashamed that people in this city, that I represent and live in and fight for, have not only to worry if their child is going to be alive the next day; they also have to worry about their own government stealing money from them.\"</p> <p>Bush studied political science at the University of Southern California and so he is quick to stress his belief that \"sport is heavily involved in politics. I think they go hand-in-hand. I feel that athletes have a political voice, and it's a powerful voice.\"</p> <p>His endorsements are outrageously lucrative but, in May 2006, soon after arriving in New Orleans in a blaze of NFL hype, he donated $50,000 (\u00a327,000) to save Holy Rosary high school - and locked his sponsors Adidas into the project. \"It's a special-needs school for kids who are mentally retarded, or struggling, and it was going under after Katrina - even though it's one of the few such schools in all New Orleans. I got Adidas to put up $56,000 to keep the school running the next two years. The local football stadium was also destroyed by Katrina. The majority of high-school kids play their games there and I was again able to fund that rebuilding with $86,000.\"</p> <p>Bush also pledged half the money he received from sales of his replica Saints jersey to the Katrina fund. More strikingly, in his first full season in the NFL, he helped raise spirits in demoralised New Orleans while leading a team that shocked America by reaching the NFC Championship game last January. If he had struggled initially to adapt from college football, Bush unleashed his explosive and elusive running in the second half of that debut season. Facing the Chicago Bears for the right to play in the 2007 Super Bowl, a 78-yard downfield rush by Bush resulted in a touchdown that brought the Saints within two points of the home team. Bush wagged his finger cheekily at the Chicago linebacker Brian Urlacher before somersaulting in joy - a slice of showboating that saw him fined $5,000 by the NFL.</p> <p>Chicago claimed that Bush's antics inspired their subsequent victory. \"Whatever,\" Bush shrugs. \"Maybe it did. But it was a fantastic play and I got caught up in the moment. The bottom line is they made it to the Super Bowl ahead of us.\"</p> <p>Last season, as if still reeling from their post-Katrina heroics, Bush and the Saints never came close to the play-offs. They appear better-equipped to challenge again this season. In their desperately narrow 34-32 away defeat against the unbeaten Denver Broncos two days ago, the Saints missed a late field-goal. Yet Bush had a fine game, rushing for 73 yards and a touchdown, and he believes New Orleans can succeed, \"if we focus on being solid and tough and win at home\".</p> <p>The Saints may have won their only home game played so far this season, against Tampa Bay, but they will swap the New Orleans Superdome for Wembley on October 26, when they play the San Diego Chargers in one of their designated home matches. \"It's going to be exciting and weird for me in London,\" Bush says, \"because I was a Chargers fan.\"</p> <p>Bush's affinity for San Diego, and particularly the Skyline area where he grew up, is plain. \"Skyline is where I come from and I won't forget it. It's not the greatest neighbourhood - with lots of crime - but I had a good family and I learnt all my values there.\" His father abandoned them soon after he was born and Bush and his brother were raised by his mother, who worked as a deputy sheriff at the county jail. While acknowledging the positive influence of his stepfather, Bush says: \"My mom has always been the one we've been scared of because she worked in the prisons and she saw the toughest of the tough guys. She definitely disciplined us. But she was so tough because she saw the potential in me and my little brother. She kept me in line while making me believe I could do great things.\"</p> <p>That assurance and self-belief is evident when Bush, who is often called \"The President\", considers the rise of Barack Obama and his own possible political future. \"Obama helps us believe anything is possible. Every election you hope you're going to take a step forward with the next president, but with Obama you have the feeling that this is someone who will not be just a good president but a great president. I met him at a private event he held in LA and, yeah, I have a gut feeling he will be president. I definitely hope he wins - not because he's black but because he's the right guy for the job.\"</p> <p>Having also met the outgoing president \"quite a few times\", he grimaces at sharing a surname with George Bush. \"I just try to be the better Bush.\" The better Bush, the multimillionaire sportstar who has learnt the value of picking up a brush and painting walls all week, does not miss a beat when asked if he would like to follow Obama into politics and perhaps, one day, even into the White House? \"I would definitely love to do something like that. Maybe even when I'm in football there might be time for some political stuff.\"</p> <p>Bush has already voiced his political concerns over hurricane-torn New Orleans but, while acknowledging the risk of hubris, he is aiming still higher. Does he truly believe that he might eventually stand for president? \"I definitely feel that, if I work hard enough, it could be a possibility. But it's not like I sit down and think, 'I would like to be president of the United States!' As a kid you might say that kind of thing but as you grow up you realise that to become president is a tough achievement. So I don't know how realistic it is for me. But I believe that if I set my sights on it I can achieve it.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The New Orleans Saints play the San Diego Chargers when NFL returns to Wembley on October 26 2008.

  "<p>From his office in the former capital of the confederacy, the mayor of Richmond, Doug Wilder, is relishing Virginia's moment in the presidential sun. On that very morning Barack Obama was campaigning in the military town of Norfolk in the south-east of the state while the Republican hopeful, John McCain, appeared with Sarah Palin in front of the biggest crowd he had yet seen in Fairfax, to the north. </p> <p>Two candidates on the same day in a state not seriously contested for the presidency in 44 years; Wilder, the state's former Democratic governor, does the maths and smiles. \"John McCain is here now,\" he says. \"You know why? Because he has to campaign in Virginia. He can't take it for granted.\"</p> <p>With its 13 electoral college votes Virginia is a weighty addition to the battleground states - roughly the equivalent of winning New Hampshire, Nevada and New Mexico together. It could not be closer. Of the last six polls both Obama and McCain have led in three each. To the south North Carolina is also shaping up to be a tight race. No Democrat has won there for 32 years and Bush took the state four years ago by 12 points. Obama has 31 offices in the state and the latest poll shows a tie.</p> <p>\"I see a crack in the solid South,\" says Wilder, the first African American to be elected as a state governor. \"I see a crack. And the fissure is taking place right here in Virginia ... to be considered a toss-up state this close to the election is amazing. We might influence North Carolina or Georgia. If we get either one of the states it's big.\"</p> <h2>Stunning victories</h2> <p>So far this fissure has failed to turn into a full-blown chasm. Polls in the summer showed Obama to be competitive in Texas, Mississippi, Georgia and Tennessee while holding narrow leads in South Carolina and Arkansas. Democrats recorded stunning byelection wins in Mississippi and Louisiana, prompting Time to run a cover proclaiming \"The End of the South\". But predictions of a full-scale remoulding of the region's electoral map have not been borne out. Obama pulled most of his staff and almost all of his advertising from Georgia a few weeks ago. Now he is focusing on North Carolina and Virginia.</p> <p>The McCain campaign has belittled these efforts as arrogance subsidised by deep pockets. They refused to counter Democrat efforts in Georgia, figuring that if they struggled there then the jig would be up everywhere. They dismiss Obama's campaigning in North Carolina as wishful thinking. </p> <p>\"It's just one more state where the Obama campaign has allowed its hubris to dictate spending decisions,\" Steve Schmidt, McCain's chief strategist, told the Associated Press. \"Soon you will see the Obama camp withdraw from North Carolina like you have seen them withdraw from other states.\"</p> <p>For all their affected nonchalance Republicans are spending almost as much money in North Carolina as the Democrats. \"North Carolina is teetering on the edge of being a swing state,\" said Ferrel Guillory, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina. \"If the Democrats continue to emphasise it and continue to advertise there they could keep it in play. But keeping it in play just means it's competitive. It doesn't mean they're going to win.\"</p> <p>Even this is no mean feat. Obama has poured in considerable resources here, flooding the area with ads, registering young and black voters at unprecedented rates and galvanising volunteers. Within 30 miles of Raleigh yesterday there were seven Obama events, involving canvassing, voter registration and phone banking. Obama was in Charlotte on Sunday; his wife, Michelle, was in the state on Thursday. McCain has not visited the state in months, his campaign has just 13 offices and nothing planned for yesterday. \"You just don't see the McCain people anywhere,\" says Betsy Muse, a frontpage blogger for the liberal site BlueNC and an Obama volunteer.</p> <p>Back in Richmond volunteers turn up at Broad Rock Library on many a weeknight, to collect campaign materials to go canvassing and registering. Obama has been hoping that this ground game of person-to-person contact will counter the Republican machine. The voter registration drives seem to be paying off. Virginia has seen more than 250,000 more voters registered since January. Most of this rise has taken place in Democratic counties. In North Carolina Democratic registration has leaped 7% while Republicans have risen 1%. The young and the black are over-represented in the increases.</p> <p>Registering young and black voters is one thing. Getting them to the polls is another. This is one reason why the polls have been particularly unreliable. </p> <p>Another reason is that it is difficult to know whether all voters are telling the truth. \"The Bubba vote is there,\" former Republican House majority leader Dick Armey told USA Today recently. \"And it's very real ... there's an awful lot of people in America, bless their heart, who simply are not emotionally prepared to vote for a black man.\" </p> <h2>Unreliable polls</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337883633\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/9/23/1222157024399/electiongraph.jpg\" alt=\"The South's vote\" width=\"203\" height=\"708\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The South's vote</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Armey says those voters are \"invisible\" in the polls because they would not admit they opposed Obama because of his race. \"I really want to say it's not going to play a big role,\" said Muse. \"But it is.\" Given how central race has been to the political realignment in the region it's hard to see how it could not. </p> <p>Until the 60s the South was the most reliable Democratic area in the country - but Southern Democrats were the most forceful supporters of racial segregation. As the civil rights movement emerged the Republicans sensed an opportunity. In 1961 Barry Goldwater launched the Republican \"Southern strategy\" in Atlanta. \"We're not going to get the Negro vote as a bloc in 1964,\" he declared, \"so we ought to go hunting where the ducks are.\" The party made an explicit appeal to white racism. When the then Democratic president Lyndon Johnson signed the 1964 civil rights act he said: \"We have lost the South for a generation.\"</p> <p>\"There's not a lot of love for Obama in many of these white Democratic strongholds,\" said Chris Kromm, the executive director of the Institute for Southern Studies. \"I've seen these older, white Hillary supporters say they'll vote for him because he's on their team. But you don't know how many of those McCain is going to be able to pick off.\"</p> <h2>Charmless</h2> <p>McCain has problems here, too. While his war record goes down well, many southerners view him as insufficiently pious and charming. During the primaries the guitar-playing former governor-cum-lay preacher Mike Huckabee won five of the 11 former confederate states, although many were held after McCain's victory was assured. At the rally in Fairfax the faithful turned out to see Sarah Palin, the straight-talking evangelical who, even though she hails from Alaska, has gone down better in the South.</p> <p>\"The South doesn't differ much from the rest of the nation on the big issues like war, tax and healthcare,\" said Guillory. \"Where it does differ is in areas of cultural conservatism - like guns, religion and abortion. In a close race that conservatism can make the difference.\"</p> <p>But Southern culture is changing. Of the 10 states with the steepest rise in Latino population, six are in the old confederacy. Meanwhile, the South's booming economy has pulled in many outsiders: particularly to the northern-most parts of Virginia and North Carolina's research triangle around the towns of Durham, Raleigh and Chapel Hill.</p> <p>\"People's perceptions of the South are rooted in an old idea of what the South looks like,\" said Kromm. \"But it's one of the fastest-changing regions in the country and one of the fastest-growing regions in the country.\"</p> <p>Obama hopes that if he can add some of these newcomers to his base of young, black and progressive voters he could create a serious upset. That idea is alive in Virginia, dead in Georgia and in intensive care in North Carolina. For now that is good enough for Muse. \"We never get this kind of attention. We're hanging on. It's still possible.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday September 23 2008. In the headline of the above article we originally referred to Barack Obama's move into the 'conservative deep South'. Virginia, the state mentioned in the piece, is in the South but isn't that deep. This has been corrected. </p>",
  "<p>The South African government is poised to shift to the left after the ruling African National Congress indicated that its deputy leader, Kgalema Motlanthe, a prominent trade unionist, will become interim president following Thabo Mbeki's forced resignation. </p> <p>The ANC will not publicly confirm Motlanthe's selection until parliament is formally informed and votes in the new president, for the remaining nine months of Mbeki's term, on Thursday.</p> <p>But yesterday the ANC leader, Jacob Zuma, hinted that Motlanthe was the choice and party officials did not deny it.</p> <p>\"I am convinced, if given that responsibility, he would be equal to the task,\" Zuma told reporters.</p> <p>However, it appeared that Mbeki has not given up the political wrangle with Zuma after a Johannesburg radio station reported that the outgoing president has attached his name to a legal petition seeking to overturn the high court ruling earlier this month that threw out a long-standing corruption case against Zuma and accused Mbeki of misusing the judicial system to keep his rival from power. It was that ruling that prompted the ANC leadership to vote to remove Mbeki.</p> <p>Motlanthe, who was jailed for 10 years by the apartheid regime, played a leading role in ousting Mbeki and installing Zuma as ANC leader last year.</p> <p>He is backed by the trade union movement and the Communist party, which were critical of Mbeki's economic policies and want to see greater wealth distribution, an end to privatisation of state assets and greater poverty relief. </p> <p>Although technically an interim president, Motlanthe is such an integral part of ANC policy-making he can be expected to begin to lay out the path of the Zuma presidency that is likely to follow after the general election in about nine months. </p> <p>The ANC forced Mbeki to accept Motlanthe into the cabinet as a minister without portfolio in July, ostensibly to smooth the way for the change in administration next year. But it was clear that the party's deputy leader was there to keep an eye on Mbeki and to ensure he carried through changes in ANC policies introduced after Zuma took charge of the party. </p> <p>Zuma said the decision to \"recall\" Mbeki was \"one of the most difficult\" in the history of the ANC.</p> <p>\"Comrade Mbeki has devoted decades of his life to the ANC and our country. The decision to recall him was not taken lightly, but it has to be taken in the interest of making the country move forward,\" he said.</p> <p>Motlanthe, 59, was a follower of the Black Consciousness Movement and was first jailed in 1976 during the student protests against the teaching of Afrikaans in black schools which set off years of unrest that played a primary role in bringing down apartheid. He was arrested again a year later and sentenced to 10 years on Robben Island.</p> <p>After his release he was elected secretary general of the National Union of Mineworkers and later held a similar post in the ANC. </p> <p>The ANC used a constitutional clause to bypass a requirement for the deputy president, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, to replace Mbeki. She was loyal to the outgoing president and resigned yesterday.</p>",
  "<p>Speaking in 1972 at the inaugural general assembly of the United Reformed Church (the result of a union between the Presbyterian Church of England and the Congregational Church in England and Wales), the Rev John Huxtable, quoted Shakespeare: \"Yon Cassius hath a lean and hungry look.\" He was drawing attention to his colleague, the Rev Arthur Macarthur, with whom, for two years, from 1972 to 1974, he shared the general secretaryship of the new church. And it was true. Over 6ft tall, very thin all his life, with a rugged, lined face, full of character, Arthur, who has died aged 94, somehow seemed characteristic of the Northumbria of his birth and upbringing.</p> <p>Although somewhat daunting on first meeting, Arthur quickly put everyone he met, however great or humble, at their ease. Intellectually very capable, he was at heart a simple Christian disciple. An acknowledged ecumenical statesman of the church, whose wisdom was widely prized, he never lost his pastoral concern for people. </p> <p>A self-effacing man, he had the great gift of being able to affirm the gifts of others. Many are the ministers of a younger generation, as well as members of congregations, who can testify to his support and care.</p> <p>When Congregationalists and Presbyterians had first negotiated to unite in 1947, Arthur had been a member of the negotiating committee. The proposal failed to gain acceptance at that time, but the hope never went away. By the time it was revived in 1965, Arthur was at the centre of the life of his church and exercised considerable influence as a member of the conversations. </p> <p>He was immensely proud to be so deeply involved in the first union of churches of different traditions in these islands since the fragmentation of the Reformation, and lost no opportunity to further the declared aim of the newly constituted United Reformed Church to foster further organic union. Memorably, in a general assembly debate in 1994 concerned with Christian unity, he declared: \"I do not believe in the United Reformed Church\" - going on to declare that he had always seen it as a provisional arrangement and a catalyst for greater things. </p> <p>Like many, he was deeply saddened not to see those hopes fulfilled in his lifetime. His autobiography, Setting Up Signs: Memories of an Ecumenical Pilgrim (1997) bears eloquent testimony to his persistent vision.</p> <p>Arthur was born in Newcastle upon Tyne and educated at Rutherford college and Armstrong College, Durham University. He trained for the ministry of the Presbyterian Church of England at Westminster Theological College, Cambridge, and was ordained in Alnwick, Northumberland, in 1937 before reaching the age of 24. Registering as a pacifist at the outbreak of the second world war, he was sent to support the work of the YMCA in France just before the Dunkirk evacuation, in which he was caught up. </p> <p>In August 1944 he was called to a pastorate in New Barnet, north London, and in 1950 moved to North Shields, where he pastored a congregation of 600, with a Sunday school of 400. In 1960, Arthur was appointed general secretary of the Presbyterian Church of England, and in 1972 was asked to continue that role within the United Reformed Church.</p> <p> In 1980, at an age when many would retire, Arthur undertook a part-time pastorate in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, quickly discovering, as he admitted, that \"the only thing that is part-time about it is the stipend\". After six fulfilling years there, he retired to Gloucestershire, where he continued for many years to lead worship in the churches and to respond to the needs of the wider church. </p> <p>His stature within the church had been appropriately acknowledged by his election to serve the general assembly of the Presbyterian Church as moderator in 1971 and of the United Reformed Church in 1974. In 1980 he became moderator of the then Free Church federal council. He was also a vice-president of the British Council of Churches. In Gloucestershire, he particularly valued his membership of a theological discussion group and attended a meeting not many weeks before his death.</p> <p>Arthur married a member of his congregation in New Barnet, Esm\u00e9 Muir, in 1950, and she shared supportively and actively in his life and ministry for the rest of his life. There was always a warm welcome in their home for friend and stranger. Esm\u00e9 survives him, along with their three sons and a daughter and six grandchildren. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Arthur Leitch Macarthur, cleric, born December 9 1913; died September 1 2008</p>",
  "<p>Big City firms which encourage traders to take too many risks to win their annual multimillion pound bonuses could face stiff penalties from the Financial Services Authority.</p> <p>The City regulator could demand financial firms put aside a bigger capital cushion if their pay schemes incentivise traders to take short-term risks that could backfire in the longer term. </p> <p>Bonuses are paid annually, sometimes before it is clear whether traders' bets have paid off or proved disastrous. Trading losses have contributed to the demise of leading firms such as Lehman Brothers, mired in controversy as its Wall Street staff seem likely to receive their bonuses after being taking over by Barclays.</p> <p>Chancellor Alistair Darling yesterday put the onus on the FSA to tackle \"the culture of huge bonuses\" in the City.</p> <p>\"It's essential that bonuses don't result in people being encouraged to take on more and more risk without understanding the damage that might be done, not just to their bank but to the rest of us in the wider economy,\" Darling told the Labour conference. </p> <p>The authority has begun scrutinising bonus policies during its regulatory visits. But the unions yesterday called on the chancellor to take direct action through taxation. Derek Simpson, leader of Unite, spoke of a \"powerful mega elite with no connection to ordinary people, an amoral class without a care for how their reckless behaviour is now wrecking lives. If you can't regulate the bonus culture, then tax it out of existence.\"</p> <p>The FSA does not intend to regulate individual bonuses, but pay deals will be analysed as part of the risk assessments of firms it regulates. A spokeswomen said: \"What might happen if we don't like [what we find]? If we believe the pay deal creates additional risks, we could make a requirement to put more capital aside.\"</p> <p>Hector Sants, the FSA's chief executive, has been warning City firms since the spring that the regulator is playing close attention to the way they pay their staff. </p> <p>But Peter Hahn, banking specialist at the Cass business school, warned against scrutiny of the bonus pool, and instead urged the FSA to focus on senior executives. \"If the top five people are paid the right way, so will the rest of the organisation. If the chief executive isn't incentivised for traders to take risk, the traders won't take risks,\" said Hahn.</p> <p>In the US, the debate is also raging. John McCain has unexpectedly backed calls by Democrats for a cap on executive pay at struggling banks. Citing large salaries at Lehman as an example of unacceptable conduct, he suggested institutions benefiting from a bail-out by taxpayers should have their salaries capped at $400,000. </p> <p>\"No CEO of any corporation or business that is bailed out by us, that is rescued by American tax dollars, should receive any more than the highest-paid person in the federal government,\" the Republican presidential candidate told CNBC. The highest paid individual in the US government is George Bush, who earns $400,000.</p> <p>The Democrats are fighting to insert a pay cap in legislation for the treasury's $700bn fund to buy up banks' distressed securities. They argue that huge pay linked to profits created perverse incentives for bankers to take bigger short-term risks. </p> <p>But treasury secretary Hank Paulson is resisting these efforts, seeing them as a sideshow which could delay the bill. </p> <p>\"There have been excesses. I agree with the American people - pay should be for performance, not for failure,\" said Paulson; but the bail-out urgently needed to be passed in simple form and remuneration reforms should come \"afterwards\".</p> <h2>AIG boss forgoes payoff</h2> <p><strong>Robert Willumstad</strong>, the outgoing head of the stricken insurance company <strong>AIG</strong>, has voluntarily <strong>forfeited</strong> a <strong>$22m (\u00a312m) </strong>severance package after being in effect sacked from his job as part of a bail-out by the US treasury. AIG's board decided that he <strong>was entitled </strong>to the money under his contract, which was drafted in generous terms just three months ago. But in an email to his successor, Edward Liddy, he wrote: \"I prefer not to receive severance while shareholders and employees have <strong>lost considerable value </strong>in their AIG shares.\" AIG was kept afloat last week through an <strong>$85bn</strong> US treasury loan; the government will take an 80% stake in AIG in return.</p>",
  "<p>Today Gordon Brown makes his big speech. He has given better platform performances this week and his party will be willing him to do well. But this will not seal his fate either way. Banks falling from the sky have commanded strict loyalty to the leader from all lips - in public, but not privately. Good handling of financial storms might still shift his fortunes, but latest polls suggest not. </p> <p>Is there anything he could do now? \"I will try my utmost,\" he said again this week, repeating his school motto. But people have lost patience with his personal efforts. Try to do what? That is the question he has failed to answer so far, and will try to today.</p> <p>Try this thought experiment. Ask what you would do if you could run the country with a large majority for 18 months? Looking at likely annihilation, Labour could seize these last days to do all it has failed to do, make good broken promises, undo errors and dare to ignore all focus groups and media. There is little to lose, and that brings its own liberation. Do whatever feels right, for its own sake regardless, and lessen regrets that will dog Labour for a decade to come. </p> <p>The paradox is that behaving as if wipeout is inevitable could be the one way to save the day. A reckless spirit of doing Labour things because Labour believes in them may be the one chance to recapture the public imagination. The days of Labour tiptoeing across a shiny floor afraid of dropping a Ming vase are over: at 20 points behind in the polls, there is nothing left to break. Let other parties scheme and calculate: those on death row no longer need to.</p> <p>Start with political reform. Declare with honesty that begging for money from eccentric and often corrupt rich donors is a blight on all parties that has caused dangerous political distrust and cynicism. Apologise and bring in state financing, parties raising nothing extra beyond ordinary membership subscriptions - including trade union funds. It's a cheap price to pay for probity.</p> <p>In the wilderness, Labour will regret most that it never secured a fair voting system. Abandoning a deal with the Lib Dems in the hubris of success was not just shortsighted for Labour, it was a tragedy for future good government. So bring in proportional representation right away, ignore howls of protest from the Tories and reform the Lords in the same bill.</p> <p>Feeling recklessly brave? Restore the media ownership laws as they were before Margaret Thatcher let Murdoch destroy them. The US is tougher on how much one owner can control. Ban foreign media ownership and make the Press Complaints Commission and its code statutory.</p> <p>Abandon everything expensive, unpopular and irrelevant to Labour's message. Why let ID cards and 42-day detention without trial make enemies of people who should be Labour friends? Plenty of serious defence and foreign policy analysts regard two aircraft carriers and the replacement of Trident as expensive irrelevancies. If that seems too dangerously like bad old Labour, hold a referendum to see if people would rather spend on better things. </p> <p>Devote Labour's last 18 months to children. An annual report in parliament measuring children's wellbeing and child poverty should become a legal obligation, answering the shaming UN report that put Britain near the bottom for children's happiness. Just as future governments will have to report on reducing carbon emissions, measuring children's wellbeing would mean better mental health, family support and not locking up children in trouble. </p> <p>A children's declaration would help Labour regain the recognition it deserves as the best government ever for children, recalled at conference meetings here time and again, as people talk of their local Sure Start and the move to extend nursery schooling to two-year-olds. If Labour's under-fives programme has filled in a great missing part of the welfare state, the new deal for 14- to 18-year-olds deserves the same accolade. It's almost impossible to get media attention for children not destined for A-levels, but at last vocational diplomas and apprenticeships for all who want them gives every child a chance. The Tories are contemptuous, as well as sneering about sending more young people to university. It's excellent that Brown will announce today broadband access for all children at home, but Labour needs to cement children's priorities into the political process.</p> <p>Inequality is a word once banned from New Labour's lexicon, but not now. Both Miliband brothers used it boldly, speaking of the need to narrow the widening gap. The call for taxing the rich to ease tax on the low paid resounded almost universally through the conference meeting rooms (except among the Hutton/Flint/Purnell ultras). The urgent need to rebalance a tax system grown grossly unfair was on all lips here. Time to stop the many paying more tax than the rich few. That's what Labour is for. That call has become the totemic issue for most people here - but Brown will not relent, which makes it all the odder that the left and the unions are his great defenders.</p> <p>What else? Get tougher on non-doms. No one understands how people born, bred and living here can avoid paying British tax. Peg the minimum wage to earnings plus 1%, so the low paid keep advancing instead of falling behind as in the past two years. Make union recognition easy: inequality soared once most of the low paid lost any organisation. Create a high pay commission, as the Work Foundation suggests, to say when enough greed is enough, as part of new regulation of banking and the City. Don't take fright at every idle threat that wealth will flee.</p> <p>No one could point to swing-voter focus groups, who would applaud all this in advance. The enemy media would proclaim it all outrageously, dangerously Soviet. But none of this is extreme, and all of it benefits middle Britain. Possibly, just possibly, the sheer sincerity of doing what you really believe is worth trying. Apologising, telling the truth and ignoring the media might just regain public respect. </p> <p>If it fails, nothing much is lost in the present climate - and some satisfying good is done. Why waste this time? It is unthinkable that Brown could ever throw caution to the winds - but this week other contenders looked as if they could have the optimism and bravery to capture a dash of this. Act as if all is lost, and all may still be won.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>It sure is a swell show Labour is putting on in Manchester this week. Would that the usual hordes were here to see it. But many of the private sector exhibitors have stayed away from GMEX - a diary clash apparently; nothing to do with the smell of death. Just as conspicuous by their absence are the lobbyists. It has often been the custom of Bell Pottinger, one of the biggest of the big beasts, to throw a champagne party at the Labour shindig - and they will for the Tories next week. But for Manchester there's a just few pounds stashed behind the bar at an event thrown by the Fabians. At least they didn't send flowers.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Speaking of the Fabians, the group's debate entitled Can we give the white working class what they want? was notable for its sponsor Asda, whose representative spoke of the company's commitment to training and union learning. Lots of people thought immediately about Wal-Mart - Asda's parent company, which is famously hostile to unions in the US - but all of them stayed quiet. Admirable. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> And there was Iain Duncan Smith sitting in first class on the train to Manchester to participate in a debate on social inequality. One day we'll all travel that way.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Be nice to him, we said in June, when it emerged that the Sikh detective sergeant Gurpal Virdi had fought and won yet another case against the Met - his third. But no one listens to us in these matters. So here we go again. This time the issue was his inspector's exams in 2007, a process made more difficult by the fact that his studying was hampered by a serious eye condition. He sought a \"reasonable adjustment\" - that is, extra time - but despite all-round recognition that he was indeed hampered by this disability, the request was turned down and he failed. An employment tribunal was scheduled to hear all about it last Thursday, but on the morning of the hearing, the previously bullish Met performed another of its spectacular pirouettes: admitting fault, providing an apology and sending him - as is now traditional - a nice cheque, this time for \u00a34,500. So that's \u00a3240,000 in 2001, \u00a374,500 in 2008. Listen. Do nice. It's cheaper. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> No end in sight, we fear, for the race row at the National Union of Students. An inquiry has cleared the president of King's College London student union, after the furore sparked by a training event at which he appeared to link the prospect of more minority undergraduates with fears of more gun and knife crime. He says that he was merely making non-racist remarks about security, and the union appears to have accepted that. Nevertheless, it suggests he re-acquaints himself with the equal opportunities policy. The NUS inquiry into the other charmer reported to have scandalised the same event with his Bring Back Slavery sign is ongoing, but seems unlikely to satisfy the black students who first raised the complaints. President Wes Streeting gets to sort it all out. Lucky him.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> So is it a crash or is it a correction? The smart money says crash will win out. And it makes a better headline. It will touch every area of our national life, and our man in the stands points out that on March 4 next year, when Newcastle United next play champions Manchester United, it will in essence be a battle between the British taxpayer, for we fund Newcastle's sponsor, Northern Rock, and the US taxpayer, who now owns 80% of United's sponsor AIG. War by other means ... and this time we'll win. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> But anything is better than a shooting war. Certainly that's what they would say in Georgia. No one knows exactly what it was that led Putin and his manservant Medvedev to withdraw the troops, but Georgian websites have their theories. The news site <a href=\"http://www.finchannel.com\">finchannel.com</a> says the Russians pulled back because they faced a terrible slating on Facebook, and this must be broadly right because they got it from the satirical UK site, <a href=\"http://www.NewsBiscuit.co.uk\">NewsBiscuit</a>.

  "<p>Sarah Palin has thrown herself into a 36-hour crash course in foreign diplomacy as she makes a highly publicised visit to the UN in New York this week in an attempt to shrug off the perception that she is an international affairs ing\u00e9nue.</p> <p>The Republican vice-presidential candidate, who obtained a passport to travel outside North America for the first time only last year, is meeting a raft of leaders from several of the world's current hotspots. But her cramming timetable fails to include any scheduled encounter with a major European leader.</p> <p>Her induction begins tonight with attendance at a cocktail party held by President George Bush at the city's Waldorf-Astoria. The Lebanese president, Michel Suleiman, and other leaders, carefully selected for their goodwill towards America, were on the guest list.</p> <p>Even before Palin takes her first steps today into the UN's international territory on the East Side of Manhattan, she has walked into controversy. She had been billed to appear at a rally outside the UN building organised by New York Jewish groups protesting at the arrival of the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, at the annual UN general assembly.</p> <p>But Palin's invitation was withdrawn by organisers following a public spat with Hillary Clinton. The senator for New York had accepted an offer to attend but pulled out saying Palin's late inclusion on the speaker list would have politicised the event.</p> <p>The New York Sun yesterday published the speech that Palin would have made had she appeared at the rally. In it, she calls for action to thwart Ahmadinejad, who she says should be held accountable under international law for the crime of inciting genocide. \"He must be stopped,\" the speech says.</p> <p>Since her appointment as John McCain's running mate last month Palin has faced stiff criticism, and even ridicule, for her lack of international experience. Democratic opponents have pointed out she is just one heartbeat away from the presidency should McCain fall ill in office.</p> <p>The McCain campaign unwittingly fanned the flames by emphasising that as governor of Alaska she was knowledgeable about neighbouring Russia. The theme was picked up in a Saturday Night Live spoof in which Tina Fey has Palin say: \"I can see Russia from my house.\"</p> <p>Bloggers also went to town after a television interview in which she was flummoxed by a reference to the \"Bush doctrine\", the argument that pre-emptive strikes against threatening states or terrorist groups can be justified.</p> <p>The main effort to dispel the impression of naivety will begin today when Palin enters the UN. In meetings that will continue into tomorrow, she will meet leaders from many of the world's most sensitive regions. But according to the list put out by Reuters, there will be no western European leaders among her engagements. It has been confirmed that the British government has neither been approached by the Palin team, nor sought any contact.</p> <p>The only British minister she could meet casually is Kim Howells, the junior Foreign Office minister, who will attend the Bush cocktail party.</p> <p>She will meet the presidents of Afghanistan and Iraq, Hamid Karzai and Jalal Talabani, as well as the leader of the main US ally in Latin America, Alvaro Uribe of Colombia. The new Pakistani president, Asif Ali Zardari, is on the list, as is Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh.</p> <p>There is no seat at the Palin table for China or notably Russia after the conflict in Georgia, though the presidents of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, and Ukraine, Viktor Yushchenko, are included.</p> <p>Peter Beinart, senior fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, said the cast was unsurprising. \"These are all leaders of countries considered friendly to the US. McCain is a more us-versus-them kind of guy than Obama, and you can see that reflected on the list.\"</p> <p>The other interesting entry on the list is Henry Kissinger, whom Palin will meet today. The former US secretary of state under Richard Nixon was once highly divisive, but now occupies a lofty position as elder statesman and has been frequently consulted by Bush.</p> <h2>Meet and greet</h2> <p>On<strong> Tuesday</strong> the Republican vice-presidential candidate will meet the Afghan president, <strong>Hamid Karzai</strong>, and the Colombian president, <strong>Alvaro Uribe</strong>, and will also enjoy a sit-down with the former US secretary of state <strong>Henry Kissinger</strong>. On<strong> Wednesday </strong>she is lined up to meet a string of world leaders, including the Iraqi president, <strong>Jalal Talabani</strong>. Palin also has scheduled meetings with the Georgian president, <strong>Mikheil Saakashvili</strong>, the Ukrainian leader, <strong>Viktor Yushchenko</strong>, the new Pakistani president, <strong>Asif Ali Zardari</strong>, and the Indian prime minister, <strong>Manmohan Singh</strong>. She will also meet U2 singer and activist <strong>Bono</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>Ministers have promised to review tuition fees for part-time students after acknowledging there is \"inequality\" in the system because part-timers have to pay their fees up front. Bill Rammell, the higher education minister, told a debate on university funding organised by the University and College Union yesterday that part-time student funding would be considered in the review promised for next year. </p> <p>\"It's going to have to answer questions about part-timers,\" he said. \"There is an inequity between adults in the workplace trying to better themselves and the traditional student.\" </p> <p>The review was established as a condition for the introduction of top-up fees in 2006 after a debate in parliament which reduced the government's majority to just five. The review will consider whether to lift the \u00a33,145 cap on fees to create a more varied market in the cost of a university education, amid controversy over the impact of higher fees on the government's attempts to widen access to universities. </p> <p>By law, the review has to happen in 2009, but all political parties are concerned about raising a deeply unpopular issue on the doorstep in the run up to a general election. A poll last week by the UCU suggested that up to two-thirds of voters oppose higher fees. </p> <p>Full-time students in England and Wales only have to pay fees when they earn above a certain threshold, but part-time students have to pay when they sign up for courses. </p> <p>Rammell repeatedly said it was a \"mistake\" in 1998 to scrap the student grant and highlighted the fact that nearly two-thirds of new students this year qualified for some sort of funding. </p> <p>Wes Streeting, president of the National Union of Students, said the government was \"shirking\" an important debate because it feared the political consequences. \"We expect the government to engage properly in a debate about how universities are funded. They can't avoid this because they are worried by voters' opinions. They should listen to voters.\"</p> <p>He welcomed the decision to look again at fees. \"It's critically important that the government revisits part-time students, who have been shamefully overlooked.\"</p>",
  "<p>Two advisers to John McCain's presidential campaign today said a flood of questionable voter registration applications in swing states threatens to undermine the accuracy of the November election and could prevent legitimate voters from registering for a ballot.</p> <p>The warning came less than a week after the Democratic party filed a lawsuit in Michigan seeking to end what its lawyers said were Republican efforts to suppress votes of poor people and African Americans, two historically Democratic constituencies. The move indicates the Democratic and Republican parties are set to battle over voter registration in the remaining weeks of the campaign.</p> <p>On a conference call with reporters this afternoon, former Republican senators John Danforth and Warren Rudman said a coalition of community organisations called Acorn had in several states submitted voter registration applications for people who were already registered. </p> <p>The senators did not accuse the group of fraud, but suggested the group's registration drive was \"diluting\" legitimate votes and causing havoc in the nation's voter registration process.</p> <p>\"Our mission is to ensure that everybody who is entitled to vote gets to vote without any intimidation but also that there's no stuffing of the ballot boxes, no fraudulent voting and also that the rules are the same for everybody,\" said Danforth, a former Missouri senator. </p> <p>\"We are concerned that there is or may be a pattern of registering people who are not entitled to vote or otherwise gumming up the system for registering voters.\"</p> <p>He cited news reports in Michigan, Colorado and elsewhere describing problematic registration applications surfacing after large Acorn registration drives. Earlier this month in Detroit, for example, the secretary of state's office cited a \"sizeable number of duplicate and fraudulent applications\" arising from an Acorn drive. </p> <p>Last week, Republican officials called Acorn's North Carolina chapter \"a quasi-criminal, Democratic affiliated organisation\" after an election official asked the state to check 80 applications submitted by the group.</p> <p>Today, Danforth sought to link Acorn to the Obama camp, noting that a political action committee affiliated with Acorn endorsed Obama.</p> <p>He also said the McCain campaign was concerned that some ballot stations in heavily Democratic areas would be allowed to remain open on election night after their scheduled closing. </p> <p>State laws typically allow that anyone on line to vote when the polls are scheduled to close may cast a ballot, but Danforth said he was concerned polling sites would be kept open to accommodate Democrats' late voter turnout efforts.</p> <p>Rudman defended the party against Democratic allegations in Michigan that Republicans are working to deny the vote to people who lost their homes in the mortgage crisis. </p> <p>The Democratic party said its lawsuit filed last week in Michigan was aimed at ceasing the practice. The suit came after a Macomb county Republican official told a local newspaper the party was culling voter names from foreclosure lists to challenge their residency.</p> <p>Rudman said the suit was a \"red herring\", and that, \"all the local officials deny it\". He called on the Democratic party to come to an accord with the Republicans on election-day procedures such as extended polling hours.</p> <p>The back-and-forth between the Democratic and Republican parties reflects the historic divergence between the two camps on voter registration and ballot access. The Republican party has typically pushed for strong verification requirements, such as identification checks at the ballot, measures they say are intended to counter voter fraud. </p> <p>The Democrats, meanwhile, say such strictures will discourage the elderly and poor from voting. Non-partisan election experts say there is minimal fraud in US voting.</p>",
  "<p>A top adviser to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> took a dig at the New York Times' credibility today, calling the paper \"a pro-Obama advocacy organisation\" when discussing a news story linking the candidate's campaign manager to a lobbying operation backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p> <p>The Times reported this morning that Rick Davis, who heads day-to-day operations for McCain, was paid more than $30,000 a month during a five-year period when he represented a group seeking to limit government regulation of Fannie and Freddie. Such regulation has become a key issue for both McCain and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobamacrisis\">Barack Obama</a> as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/wallstreet\">crisis on Wall Street</a> dominates the news.</p> <p>In response to a question from CNN reporter Dana Bash regarding the Davis story, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/31/uselections2008.barackobama\">Steve Schmidt </a> said: \"Whatever the New York Times once was, it is today not by any standard a journalistic organisation, it is a pro-Obama advocacy organisation that every day attacks the McCain campaign, attacks Senator McCain, attacks Governor Palin and excuses Senator Obama.</p> <p>\"There is no level of public vetting with regard to Senator Obama's record, his background, his past statements. There is no level of outrage directed at his deceitful ads. This is an organisation that is completely, totally, 150% in the tank for the Democrat candidate.\"</p> <p>The New York Times' executive editor, Bill Keller, issued a statement in response, reading: \"The New York Times is committed to covering the candidates fully, fairly and aggressively ... Candidates and their campaign operatives are not always comfortable with that level of scrutiny, but it's what our readers expect and deserve.\"</p> <p>Democratic spokesmen declined to comment on Schmidt's remarks, but the Obama campaign this afternoon distributed a memo listing New York Times pieces it considers critical of the Democratic presidential nominee, including accounts of his relationships with Chicago political figures, his investments and his Illinois state senate voting record.</p> <p>At the Republican National Convention in St Paul earlier this month, several featured speakers, including McCain's primary rival Mike Huckabee, pointedly criticised the media in attacks cheered by delegates.</p> <p>During the question-and-answer period at a McCain rally today in Scranton, Pennsylvania, a McCain supporter asked why news organizations had committed so many reporters to investigate the background of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a>, McCain's running mate.</p> <p>\"Shame on you, shame on you,\" the woman shouted to applause, according to an Associated Press report.</p> <p>The New York Times endorsed McCain for the Republican nomination during the primary season, praising him as \"the only Republican who promises to end the George Bush style of governing from and on behalf of a small, angry fringe \u2026 [with] a record of working across the aisle to develop sound bipartisan legislation\". The newspaper endorsed Obama's rival Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. It has yet to endorse a candidate in the general election.</p>",
  "<p>The delegates and activists who gathered in Manchester Town Hall were aware that the coming election was going to be painfully close. But they also sensed that a historic victory was possible. </p> <p>Sadly for them, the election in question is being held in the United States. The purpose of yesterday evening's <a href=\"http://fabians.org.uk/\">Fabian Society</a>-organised fringe event was to explore what lessons Labour could learn from America and to ask whether \"hope can win\". </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.davidlammy.co.uk/da/12244\">David Lammy</a> began by stating of the official government line of neutrality before discussing the parallels between Labour and the Democrats. He argued that \"What works was what mattered\" had been at the heart of New Labour's mantra, \"but what is becoming is clear is that now it is not about what works, it's about what matters\".</p> <p>He offered climate change, abortion, the role of government and foreign policy as themes that now matter.</p> <p>Peter Kellner from <a href=\"http://www.yougov.com/uk/panel/\">YouGov</a> then posed the question: what are we actually arguing about in British politics? In the US, he noted, there are strong and vibrant disagreements between the parties and their supporters. \"There is a fissure between American voters on values issues like abortion, gun control and so on but should there be such a cleavage in British politics to replace the ideological conflicts of the twentieth century? Or should we carry on with the broadly centrist view that Labour and the Conservatives do not radically disagree with each other? If we are going to have something to argue about and it's not going to be economic ideology what is it going to be about?\"</p> <p>It was an intriguing question that was sadly left unexplored by the other speakers. Instead both Newsweek journalist Stryker Maguire, Labour prospective candidate Rushanara Ali and Bill Barnard from Democrats Abroad UK talked about the fact that the coming presidential election would represent an unprecedented leap for both black people and women in politics. </p> <p>Listening to the discussion it struck me that while there had been a huge amount of time devoted to discussing politics there was virtually no reference to the personalities of the candidates. And yet among the most striking aspects to the presidential race \u2013 and one of reasons why it has ignited such interest abroad \u2013 is that McCain, Obama and, love her or loathe her, Palin, all have compelling personal biographies which are surely part of their appeal. </p> <p>Is it McCain's policies that voters are responding to or the fact that he embodies the all-American hero? Is it not Obama's articulation of being at ease in his mixed race American skin that partly explain his appeal and, similarly, Palin's popularity is also partly derived from her claim to be just another working hockey mom. </p> <p>There is, of course, a presidential system in the US which will inevitably focus more on individuals than the parliamentary system. When I asked the panel for their thoughts about the role of personality in politics, Kellner argued that the problems facing Labour are bigger than Gordon Brown and that changing the leader would not change their fortunes. </p> <p>For him it's the policies, stupid. Perhaps. And yet while it may be true that ditching Brown now will not save Labour perhaps the lesson for the future, a lesson drawn from across the Atlantic, is that politics is not only about the message but also the messenger.</p>",
  "<p>I mentioned this morning the excellent NYT piece today on Rick Davis's Fannie and Freddie lobbying. It's worth pointing out that Davis and Steve Schmidt, McCain's other top strategist, got very huffy on a conference call this morning.</p> <p>Via Eric Kleefeld at <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/mccain_campaign_slams_new_york.php\">TPM</a>: Davis said on the call that he \"never lobbied a single day.\" That's a nice excuse -- so he made $30,000 a month for five years for <em>doing nothing! </em></p> <p>Schmidt added: \"Whatever the New York Times once was, it is not today by any standard a journalistic organization.

  "<p>The more I think about it and chat with others, the trickier the politics of the bailout vote gets for Obama. But here's an idea a wise lunch mate offered.</p> <p>Background: It's obvious McCain would love to vote against the bailout. It gives him separation from Bush. It lets him demagogue on and on about how he's not going to let the fat cats off the hook and stick the little people with the bill. </p> <p>McCain is the most prominent Republican in that position, but he's hardly the only one. Many of them would relish an opportunity to go back to their voters and say they stood up to a president with a 28% approval rating (never mind that they did everything he asked for 7.65 years). So lots of Republicans would presumably like a chance to vote against the bailout--also, to be fair, on anti-big-government philosophical grounds as well as political ones.</p> <p>So, says my lunch partner: Let them. Reid and Pelosi should force a vote on the naked Paulson bill, with no Democratic attachments. The presumption is that this would fail by a reasonably comfortable margin. Then hold a vote on a compromise that meets many of Democrats' conditions, and many of both candidates' conditions. Obama votes for. </p> <p>Now what does McCain do? A, he votes for. The pressure will be intense for him to do so, on substantive grounds. But in this case he has no political issue. B, he votes against, but at this point he's one of relatively few votes against, and now he's stuck railing against a bill that passed with bipartisan support and that nearly every noted economist and financial expert said was necessary. In this case, Obama can say, one of us made the tough call and is ready to lead, and the other one chose to sit in the back of the class and throw spitballs.</p> <p>I think that sounds like a winner, but things are awfully fluid. If I change my mind, or if someone else changes it for me, I'll get back to you.<br></p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's campaign managers are nervous about foreign endorsements given the negative response of Americans, who understandably feel that the decision on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree+world/uselections2008\">November 4</a> should be theirs alone. </p> <p>British politicians, however, have no such qualms about endorsements that come in the opposite direction, and David Miliband was the lucky recipient of one this afternoon. I happened to watch his speech to the Labour party conference with a member of Obama's foreign policy team. When I asked for a reaction, the instant response \u2013 just like that of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/22/davidmiliband.labourconference\">Jonathan Freedland</a> \u2013 was: \"He reminds me of Obama.\"</p> <p>The reason, I was told, was not simply Miliband's knowing appropriation of \"hope\". It was also his easy manner, his confidence and his command of the speech. My suggestion that he couldn't match the Democratic candidate in terms of charisma was explained in terms of cultural difference: \"He's English.\" </p> <p>I suspect that domestic critics will be less forgiving in their judgment. As with last year's speech, there will be those who complain that his delivery lacked panache. I think this is unfair. Every politician is now compared to Blair, but he was a one-off. If Miliband lacks the showmanship of his old boss, so does anyone else, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a>. This is not how politicians should be judged. </p> <p>It is enough that the substance of Miliband's speech was good, both as a contribution to Labour's renewal as a party of social progress and in developing stronger and more effective attacks lines to use against the Conservatives. Particularly striking was his reference to the need to close the gap between rich and poor and the belief that Labour's mission was to tackle inequality and not just poverty. </p> <p>This was said in the context of international development, but in a way that suggested the need for a broader repositioning of Labour following the financial crisis and the resulting bonfire of economic orthodoxies. These are not thoughts that senior Labour figures have articulated for years. The old taboos are breaking down, and not before time.</p> <p>Miliband also has a clear sense of how the world is changing. He acknowledges the emerging world order as being multi-polar in character with the rise of China, India and Brazil as major powers. (Russia was a notable absence from the list, suggesting that Miliband has a sound appreciation of that country's underlying weaknesses). </p> <p>His prescription for how to respond to it is also correct: a more powerful European voice within a stronger transatlantic Alliance that is able to overcome the disagreements of the Bush era. The truth is that Europe and the United States are going to need each other more in the coming decades as the rising powers claim their rightful place within the international system. But the relationship will have to become better balanced if it is to survive. This requires a US leadership that is prepared to listen and compromise, and an EU that is willing and able to shoulder its responsibilities. Neither of these is assured, so the aim of British policy should be to bring them about.</p> <p>Finally, Miliband identified a real achilles heel in the Conservative approach, demanding as it does that Britain should continue to be a major force in global affairs while simultaneously cutting it off from its major allies in Europe. Whether it comes to tackling climate change, creating a more stable and just global economy or challenging Russian abuses as an energy supplier, the road to success runs through Brussels, where the policy levers and collective muscle of the EU can achieve results beyond the resources of even its largest member states. </p> <p>The changing distribution of world power will only make this more so, leaving the Conservatives increasingly exposed in their hostility to Europe. This ought to be a major theme of Labour's efforts to force greater scrutiny of David Cameron's policies.</p> <p>Although he would never say so, much of what <a href=\"https://blogs.fco.gov.uk/roller/miliband/\">Miliband</a> hopes for the world will be easier to achieve with Barack Obama in the White House, not least in respect of transatlantic unity. I also suspect that there will be another, more personal reason why the foreign secretary hopes for a Democratic win in six weeks. In terms of generation and style the compatibility is obvious. He may not be the English Obama, but he is a closer fit than anyone else.</p>",

But now the McCain campaign has a whole new set of potential character-based arguments in their candidate's favour, thanks to the Brazilian former beauty queen Maria Gracinda Teixeira de Jesus, who tells a newspaper that the young McCain was \"tasty, loving and romantic\" and \"good at everything\" in bed \u2014&#xa0;so good, in fact, that Ms Teixeira de Jesus, now 77, had to \"purchase a book which taught me how to kiss to keep up with him.\" She recalls: \"He was a lovely person and loved to go out with me. I called him 'John' but he was my dear and my coconut dessert.\" Indeed! Anyway, it surely can't be long before the campaign finds a way to capitalise on this news, which demonstrates that McCain is not just a fighter but also a lover \u2014 a man who, if all else fails, will simply romance the Dow Industrials Index back to new heights of intensity. According to unconfirmed reports, campaign manager Rick Davis is even now working on a press release based on some horrific Carry-On-style joke involving the phrase \"stimulus package\".

  "<p>Sarah Palin has thrown herself into a 36-hour crash course in foreign diplomacy as she makes a highly-publicised visit to the UN in New York this week in an attempt to shrug off the perception that she is an international affairs ing\u00e9nue.</p> <p>The Republican vice-presidential candidate, who obtained a passport to travel outside North America for the first time only last year, is meeting a raft of leaders from several of the world's current hotspots.</p> <p>But her cramming timetable fails to include any scheduled encounter with a major European leader.</p> <p>Her induction begins tonight with attendance at a cocktail party held by President George Bush at the city's Waldorf-Astoria hotel. </p> <p>Lebanese president Michel Suleiman and other leaders, carefully selected for their goodwill towards America, were on the guest list.</p> <p>Even before Palin takes her first steps tomorrow morning into the UN's international territory on the east side of Manhattan, she has walked into controversy. </p> <p>She had been billed to make an appearance at a rally outside the UN building organised by New York Jewish groups protesting the arrival of the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, at the annual UN general assembly.</p> <p>But Palin's invitation was withdrawn by organisers following a public spat with Hillary Clinton. The senator for New York had accepted a previous offer to attend but pulled out complaining that Palin's late inclusion on the speaker list would have politicised the event.</p> <p>The New York Sun today published the speech that Palin would have made had she appeared at the rally. In it, she calls for action to thwart Ahmadinejad who she says should be held accountable under international law for the crime of inciting genocide.</p> <p>\"He must be stopped,\" the speech says.</p> <p>Since her appointment as John McCain's presidential running mate last month, Palin has faced stiff criticism, and even ridicule, for her lack of international experience. Democratic opponents have pointed out that she is just one heartbeat away from taking over the US presidency herself should McCain fall ill in office.</p> <p>The McCain campaign unwittingly fanned the flames of the criticism by emphasising that as governor of Alaska she was knowledgeable about neighbouring Russia. </p> <p>The theme was picked up in a Saturday Night Live spoof in which Tina Fey as Palin says: \"I can see Russia from my house\".</p> <p>Bloggers have also gone to town on her the moment in a television interview when she was flummoxed by a reference to the \"Bush doctrine\", the argument that pre-emptive strikes against threatening states or terrorist groups can be justified.</p> <p>The main work of dispelling the impression of naivety will begin tomorrow morning when Palin enters the gladiatorial ring of the UN. In a succession of meetings that will continue into Wednesday, she will meet leaders from many of the most sensitive regions of the world.</p> <p>But according to the list put out by Reuters, there will be no western European leaders among her engagements. It has been confirmed that the British government has neither been approached by the Palin team, nor sought any contact with it.</p> <p>The only UK minister she could meet casually is Kim Howells, the junior foreign office minister, who will attend the Bush cocktail party.</p> <p>She will meet the presidents of Afghanistan and Iraq, Hamid Karzai and Jalal Talabani, in recognition of the two wars the US is engaged in, as well as the leader of the main US ally in Latin America, Alvaro Uribe of Colombia. The new Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari is on the list, as is the Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh.</p> <p>There is no seat at the Palin table for China or notably Russia following the conflict in Georgia, though the presidents of Georgia itself, Mikheil Saakashvili , and Ukraine, Viktor Yushchenko, are included.</p> <p>Peter Beinart, senior fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, said the cast was unsurprising for the deputy of McCain.</p> <p>\"These are all leaders of countries considered friendly to the US. McCain is a more Us-versus-Them kind of guy than Obama, and you can see that reflected on the list.\"</p> <p>The other interesting entry on the list is Henry Kissinger, who Palin will meet tomorrow. The former US secretary of state under Richard Nixon was once highly divisive, but now occupies a lofty position as elder statesman and has been frequently consulted by Bush.</p>",
  "<p><strong>How is the US Congress aiming to address the turmoil on Wall Street and the meltdown in the home mortgage industry?</strong></p> <p>The Bush administration, spearheaded by treasury secretary Henry Paulson, has proposed a plan that would allow the treasury department to spend up to $700bn to purchase mortgage-based assets from troubled financial institutions. </p> <p>To be eligible under the Bush plan, firms must have \"significant operations in the US\" unless the treasury secretary waives the requirement. The treasury department would hire managers to purchase and eventually sell the assets.</p> <p><strong>That sounds like a lot of money.</strong><br>The $700bn figure is roughly the amount the US has spent on the war in Iraq so far. That is about one quarter of the annual federal budget.</p> <p><strong>Is Congress cooperating?</strong><br>Congressional leaders of both parties have indicated they will enact legislation along the lines of the Bush request this week, in part because neither the Democrats nor the Republicans want to appear to be obstructing the bailout with elections looming in November.</p> <p><strong>What do Democratic members of Congress want?</strong><br>Democrats want more protections for homeowners and strengthened congressional oversight. Those would include allowing bankruptcy judges to rewrite mortgages on primary residences to make terms more favourable for borrowers. Democrats also want to limit the compensation and \"golden parachute\" packages for executives of firms participating in the bailout. </p> <p><strong>What do Republican members of Congress want?</strong><br>Meanwhile, conservative Republicans are disturbed by the size of the obligation being foisted onto taxpayers and the scope of power being given to the treasury department. In principle many would oppose strictures on executive pay, but McCain has precluded that argument by siding with Democrats. The bloc has yet to offer an alternative and will likely back the Paulson plan as presented while opposing Democratic efforts to wring concessions from Bush. </p> <p><strong>What do Barack Obama and John McCain say?</strong><br>The economic distress has had both presidential candidates adopting populist tones and calling for more regulation of the financial services industry.</p> <p>Obama backs the Bush plan in principle but said in return for the mammoth public investment, financial firms should submit to oversight and regulation.</p> <p>McCain backs a \"very tight, targeted bill\" without the provisions sought by the Democrats, his economic adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin told the Wall Street Journal.</p>",

  "<p>There weren't many fireworks at the University and College Union's fringe meeting on university funding this morning, but there was perhaps an important shift in language on behalf of the government. </p> <p>Bill Rammell, the universities minister, gave some indications of the scope for next-year's all-important review of top-up fees. He said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/22/education.labourconference\">the situation of part-timers</a> would be properly considered. Perhaps one of the most unfair elements of the current funding system is that part-timers - often people who are trying to fit their education around a job or family - have to pay fees upfront rather than later in life when they can afford it. </p> <p>He said the review would consider the \"inequity\" in funding between people who are working and trying to get a degree at the same time and traditional school-leavers. How to raise the aspirations of children in schools would also figure. </p> <p>Not altogether surprising, but perhaps a little more candid than before. He also repeatedly admitted that the scrapping of grants in 1998 had been a \"mistake\", which the 2006 review had rectified. But all in all it was a neat side-step from the central question of whether fees will rise with the review. <br><br>The debate, to an audience of mostly UCU members and NUS, was heated in only one respect: there was clear frustration at the lack of political debate about the future of fees and what will happen in the review. Rammell was accused of colluding with the opposition to kick the debate into the long grass after the election, so neither party has to come up with policies which could prove disastrous on the doorstep - last week's UCU poll found that half of voters still oppose fees. </p> <p>But Wes Streeting, NUS president, said afterwards he detected a change in tone in the minister. Rammell was asked about the unpopular bursary system which a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/sep/18/tuitionfees.accesstouniversity\">Higher Education Policy Institute report last week</a> suggested should be replaced with a national system so all students were awarded what they needed rather than what their university could afford. He went a long way to remind the audience that it is what it is because universities rejected a national bursary system first time round, but added: \"Perhaps we need to reflect on that and look at it again.\"</p> <p>Interestingly, he also denied vehemently that the system had been set up as a market, based on market ideals pointing out that nearly all universities charge the maximum fee. Streeting said he felt this was a subtle and important shift away from the market dogma that has surrounded the debate, suggesting it could be moving in a different direction.</p>",

He declined to elaborate on why the decision was made. </p> <p>\"Perhaps the terrorists knew the Marriott was the venue of the dinner for all the leadership where the president, prime minister and speaker would be present,\" Malik said. \"At the eleventh hour, the president and prime minister decided the venue would be the prime minister's house. It saved the entire leadership.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the hotel said he was not aware that Zardari and Gillani had planned to meet at the hotel. \"We didn't have any reservation for such a dinner that the government official is talking about,\" he said.</p> <p>News of the apparent near miss for Zadari and Gillani came as British Airways halted all flights to Pakistan because of security fears raised by Saturday night's bombing in Islamabad.</p> <p>\"We have temporarily suspended our flight operations in Pakistan,\" a BA spokesman said. \"The safety of our customers, crew and aircraft is of paramount importance.\"</p> <p>The last flight to Islamabad, the only Pakistani destination served by BA, left yesterday. A scheduled departure from London's Heathrow airport tomorrow has been cancelled and the airline is assessing whether or not to go ahead with a flight on Wednesday.</p> <p>Tensions remained high in Pakistan, with Afghanistan's ambassador-designate to the country, Abdul Khaliq Farahi, kidnapped today in the north-western city of Peshawar by gunmen who ambushed his car and killed his driver.</p> <p>At least 53 people were killed and 266 wounded in the Marriott attack after a bomber blew up a lorry containing 600kg (1,322lb) of explosives at a gateway to the complex. The explosion left a crater 20 metres (65ft) wide and 8 metres (26ft) deep.</p> <p>The body of the Czech ambassador, Ivo Zdarek, was among those pulled from the rubble. Zdarek, 47, moved to Islamabad last month.</p> <p>Two Americans, said to be US defence department employees, were killed in the blast. Their identities have not been revealed.</p> <p>The Danish intelligence agency said last night that one of its agents, a security adviser, was missing after the attack and was presumed dead.</p> <p>Six British citizens, including a child, have been treated in hospital for their injuries. Two were hit by flying glass in a bakery half a mile from the hotel.</p> <p>Of the six, two were under observation in hospital, while the others were discharged with superficial injuries. Three of the injured worked for the British high commission in the city.</p> <p>The bombing happened after dusk on Saturday when hundreds of people were dining in several restaurants inside the hotel. Closed-circuit television footage showed the driver of the lorry ramming into the security gates but failing to breach a second barrier.</p> <p>The British embassy, one of the largest in the world and employing 150 British workers, was functioning as normal today.</p> <p>The foreign secretary, David Miliband, said the bombing would only reinforce Britain's determination to combat terrorism in the country.</p> <p>\"This latest bombing attack in Islamabad is yet another shocking and disgraceful attack without justification,\" he said. \"We continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with the government of Pakistan against the violent extremists who have no answers but only offer death and mayhem. This horrific attack reinforces our shared determination to tackle violent extremism.\"</p> <p>The Conservative party leader, David Cameron, who recently visited Pakistan, said: \"This attack underlines why Britain and Pakistan must work together at every level to defeat terrorism and to send a clear message to the terrorists that we will remain steadfast in the face of the threat from terrorism.\"</p> <p>The prime minister, Gordon Brown, joined the condemnation. \"We already work with the Pakistan government in giving help with counter-terrorism operations; we will continue to do that,\" he told Sky News. \"But, as I was saying to the president of Pakistan a few days ago, we are going to have to step up the cooperation between our two countries, and with other countries, so that we can deal with this terrorist threat.\"</p> <p>The blast at the hotel occurred days after Zardari visited 10 Downing Street for talks. It comes against a backdrop of increasing tension between the US and Pakistan after it was revealed that American ground troops had made incursions into Pakistani territory from Afghanistan to fight militants without permission from Islamabad.</p> <p>Pakistani security services have recently stepped up military action against al-Qaida and Taliban forces along the Afghan border.</p>",

  "<p>South Africa's ruling African National Congress now has to face life after Mbeki. The results are untidy. Immediately Mbeki will be replaced as acting president by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/22/southafrica3\">Kgalema Motlanthe</a>, an old Stalinist militant of the SACP who has spoken of how he wishes the youth of South Africa to be taught \"to hate capitalism\". This will continue until <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hmYvUjed1SZ_Rk0mZgmy9XqOWDSAD93AJI400\">Jacob Zuma</a> (whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/22/southafrica3\">trial for corruption</a> will now be quashed) succeeds at the next election, due in April 2009. Zuma is feared by business because of his alliance with the SACP and the trade unions but this is an alliance of convenience. The ongoing criminalisation of the state is perhaps more to be feared but this was, to be fair, already <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/21/southafrica.mbeki\">well advanced</a> under Mbeki.</p> <p>The fall of Mbeki is a more than personal event. Mbeki stood for an unreconstructed 1960s African nationalism with a large dash of Marxist-Leninism. Even in his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/22/southafrica\">farewell speech</a> he once again quoted <a href=\"http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Fanon.html\">Frantz Fanon</a> and spoke of the need for African unity, both utterly discredited 1960s themes. It is known that he feels the ANC has turned into a different sort of party \u2013 as indeed it has: it is cruder, rougher, more factional, more corrupt, less disciplined and generally a good half-way towards the hurly-burly of Nigerian political reality. It is possible that South Africans will, on looking back, see their freedom politics as a descent from Mandela's Olympian heights to Mbeki's still grand style, with the ball now down in the scrum. This would be a mistake \u2013 Mandela was, after all, president throughout the arms deal, which has so, poisoned subsequent politics \u2013 but perceptions are powerful.</p> <p>Until now Zuma has had only campaigning to do, bursting into song on every even half-suitable occasion. He will now have to start thinking hard about how he will govern. Almost certainly he will bring to power with him a far more KwaZulu-Natal and Durban crowd - people like the canny tax boss, Pravin Gordhan, Zweli Mkhize, the KZN provincial health minister, and Johnny Copelyn, the former trade unionist turned multi-millionaire businessman. For the moment most of Mbeki's ministers will stay on - even Mbeki's chief fixer, <a href=\"http://news.iafrica.com/sa/1167221.htm\">Essop Pahad</a>, wants to stay on as minister of the presidency, which is rather like Alistair Campbell saying he would stay on under David Cameron. Some may even last but it seems likely there will be a <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601116&amp;sid=aC5XBbRNmBOg&amp;refer=africa\">considerable clearout</a> of Mbeki's ministers in time, including \"Terror\" Lekota (defence), Manto Tshabalala-Msimang (health), Alec Erwin (public industries) and Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka (deputy president, who already wants to go). None of these will be missed and there will be much relief that at last Aids policy will be based on medicine and science, for Zuma is no Aids denialist. Indeed, while the whites and business and many blacks are fearful of Zuma, it is quite possible that in some respects he will be a clear improvement.</p>",
  "<p>The power struggle to shape the largest financial bailout in US history begins today in Congress, where members of both parties are weighing how many conditions to set on a rescue plan for Wall Street.</p> <p>Though few in Washington dispute treasury secretary Henry Paulson's insistence on quick passage of the proposed $700bn government intervention, Democrats are serving notice that they will seek to add more taxpayer benefits and oversight to the plan before approving it.</p> <p>\"We will not simply hand over a $700bn blank check to Wall Street and hope for a better outcome,\" Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, said yesterday.</p> <p>Republicans, meanwhile, are caught between an unpopular president and a newly populist presidential nominee as they decide whether to pursue their own changes to the financial-market restructuring. </p> <p>John Boehner, the leader of House Republicans, yesterday proposed an oversight panel to monitor Paulson's implementation of the plan. All profits from the government's ultimate sale of risky mortgage-backed securities should help pay off the US national debt, Boehner added. </p> <p>Yet even those issues on which the two parties can find common ground \u2013 such as congressional oversight and ensuring that taxpayers see a share of the profits from the bailout \u2013 could remain obstacles to final passage of Paulson's proposal.</p> <p>The tumult of the past week has shaken Republicans' ideological faith in free markets, leaving their once-vaunted party unity in shambles with 42 days remaining before the election. </p> <p>Some of their members may echo John McCain, who joined senior Democrats in calling for a cap on executive compensation at firms that receive government help.</p> <p>Other Republicans are more likely to back Paulson's call for a \"clean\" rescue bill that lacks any new provisions to benefit taxpayers. </p> <p>If Democratic congressional leaders attempt to pad the bailout with aid to homeowners facing bankruptcy due to foreclosure, the party of George Bush could stage a rally to support his version of the plan.</p> <p>The Senate banking committee is slated to hear from Paulson and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke tomorrow, with its House counterpart following on Wednesday. </p> <p>Another potentially controversial element of the bailout is Paulson's request for legal immunity as he manages the purchase of distressed Wall Street assets. Given that the treasury secretary is a former Wall Street CEO, the immunity grant could raise questions about Paulson's ability to unilaterally assist his allies at Goldman Sachs and other embattled firms.</p> <p>House Democrats hope to vote on the financial bailout before the weekend, but few on Capitol Hill expect Congress to keep to its original schedule and depart for the year on Friday. </p> <p>Senator Chris Dodd, chairman of the banking panel, has asked to keep Congress in session throughout the autumn in case more quick financial action is needed.</p> <p>As Paulson's plan began circulating yesterday, Democratic senator Robert Menendez gave voice to his party's common complaint: the Bush administration proposal is \"all Wall Street and no Main Street\".</p> <p>The Senate banking panel's senior Republican Richard Shelby, sounded almost like a Democrat yesterday as he told CBS news that the bailout \"doesn't do anything for the homeowner\".</p> <p>\"This is doing something for the banks, and if [homeowners] get any relief it will be incidental,\" Shelby said.</p> <p>With the markets responding anxiously to any news from Washington, the pressure will mount on Congress to act quickly as the week progresses. But as the debate begins, only one thing appeared certain: the bailout is in for a bumpy ride.</p>",
  "<p>Ministers have promised to review tuition fees for part-time students after acknowledging there was \"inequality\" in the system because they have to pay their fees upfront.</p> <p>Bill Rammell, the higher education minister, told a debate on university funding organised by the University and College Union today that part-time student funding would be considered in the review of university funding promised for next year. </p> <p>\"It's going to have to answer questions about part-timers,\" he said. \"There is an inequity between adults in the workplace trying to better themselves and the traditional student.\" </p> <p>The review was established as a condition of the introduction of top-up fees in 2006 after a debate in parliament that reduced the government's majority to just five. </p> <p>It will consider whether to lift the \u00a33,145 cap on fees to create a more varied market in the cost of going to university amid deep controversy over the impact of higher fees on the government's attempts to widen participation to university. </p> <p>By law, the review has to happen in 2009 but all political parties are concerned about raising an issue which will prove deeply unpopular on the doorstep in the run-up to the general election. A poll last week by the UCU suggested that up to two-thirds of voters oppose higher fees. </p> <p>Full-time students have to pay fees but not until they are earning above a certain threshold while part-time students have to pay fees when they sign up for courses. </p> <p>Rammell repeatedly said it was a \"mistake\" in 1998 to scrap the student grant and highlighted the fact that nearly two-thirds of new students this year qualified for some sort of funding.<br> Wes Streeting, president of the National Union of Students, said that the government was \"shirking\" an important debate because it feared the political consequences. </p> <p>\"We expect the government to engage thoughtfully and properly in a debate about how universities are funded. They can't avoid this because they are worried by voters' opinions. They should listen to voters on this.\"</p> <p>He welcomed the decision to look again at fees. \"It's critically important that the government revisits part-time students who have been shamefully overlooked.\"<br></p>",

  "<p>Last night on 60 Minutes, John McCain said outright that he would seek to make Andrew Cuomo, the Democratic attorney general of New York state, his head of the SEC. Transcript:</p> <blockquote> <p><br> McCain: \"Technically he can't be, quote, fired. But I'll tell you: When I'm President, if I want somebody to resign, they resign.\"</p> <p> Pelley: \"I'm curious. If you wanna fire Chris Cox, the chairman of the SEC, who would you replace him with?\"</p> <p> McCain: \"This may sound a little\u2014 unusual, but I've admired\u2014 Andrew Cuomo. I think he is somebody who could restore some credibility, lend some bipartisanship to this effort.\"</p> <p> Pelley: \"He's a Democrat.\"</p> <p> McCain: \"Oh, yes.\"</p> <p> Pelley: \"He served in the cabinet of President Clinton.\"</p> <p> McCain: \"Yes. And he did a good job. And he has respect. And he has prestige.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Cuomo's office responded that such talk was inappropriate in light of its own probes into the current market turmoil. But it may well be inappropriate in another way.</p> <p>It's illegal for presidential candidates to promise or pledge an appointment before the election. Here's <a href=\"http://vlex.com/vid/19191068\">the relevant language</a> from the United States Code:</p> <blockquote> <p>Whoever, being a candidate, directly or indirectly promises or pledges the appointment, or the use of his influence or support for the appointment of any person to any public or private position or employment, for the purpose of procuring support in his candidacy shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and if the violation was willful, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now, obviously the hard-to-prove part here is \"for the purpose of procuring support for his candidacy.\" And of course I understand that no authority figure is going to bust John McCain on this point. But this kind of thing deserves our attention. This law became law because candidates used to routinely offer important posts to people who could deliver votes as part of political deals, either for their support or for the support of constituencies with whom they were popular. </p> <p>Whether McCain crossed a legal line or not, that is essentially what he's doing here. I happen to know Andrew Cuomo and I think he was a mostly successful cabinet official under Clinton. But let's just say that I bet McCain would've been somewhat less likely to mention Cuomo's name if he weren't Catholic.<br></p>",
  "<p><strong>Rupert Murdoch</strong> has shown himself much more willing to air his views in recent years than in his younger years, when he tended to shy away from live television interviews. Of course, it does help a little when he appears on the channel owned by his own company.</p> <p>But the <strong>Fox News</strong> anchor who interviewed him on Friday pressed him in the way that many other TV journalists would have done. You can see a three-minute <strong>Live Feed</strong> clip <a href=\"http://www.thrfeed.com/2008/09/murdoch-obamas.html\">here</a>. </p> <p>Two highlights: Murdoch said he doesn't regret the <strong>New York Post</strong> endorsing <strong>John McCain</strong>. \"I am very worried. I like Senator Obama very much. I have met him. He is a very intelligent man. But his policy of anti-globalization, protectionism, is going... to give us a lot of inflation. They're going to ruin our relationships with the rest of the world. And they are going to slow down the rest of the world, too.\"</p> <p>And on the call by McCain's running mate, <strong>Sarah Palin</strong>, for increased market regulation: \"Clearly, there has to be some more regulation, but we have to be careful what that is. It could make things a lot worse. The more you get the politicians in that don't know the first thing about banking, even less than me, and God knows what might come out of it.\"</p>",
  "<p>We are now entering the closing weeks of what promises to be yet another close and contentious presidential election contest. As each side seeks to maximise its advantages and minimise its weaknesses, the Republican party has chosen the lowest of low roads, engaging in two sleazy political marketing campaigns over the past week.</p> <p>First, DVDs of an anti-Muslim documentary film are being <a href=\"http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003849746\">distributed to 28 million voters in swing states</a> like Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Colorado and Wisconsin. Second, Republican telemarketers have begun push polling aimed at scaring Jewish voters in swing states from voting for Barack Obama.</p> <p>The 2005 film, called <a href=\"http://www.obsessionthemovie.com/about_synopsis.php\">Obsession: Radical Islam's War Against the West</a>, warns that Islamic jihadists aim to take over the US government and destroy our way of life and urges voters to consider which candidate will best protect the nation. Among other subtleties, the film attempts to equate Islam with Nazism, juxtaposing scenes of children being encouraged to become suicide bombers with shots of Nazi rallies.</p> <p>The film was distributed as an advertising supplement in major newspapers, including the New York Times. In addition, the <a href=\"http://www.jewsonfirst.org/08a/cufi_obsession.html\">Republican Jewish Coalition has mailed the DVDs</a> to rabbis and Jewish organisational mailing lists, while a Christian Zionist group distributed it to delegates at the Republican and Democratic conventions. Sheldon Adelson, a major funder of arch-conservative causes and Likud party leader Bibi Netanyahu, personally gives the DVD to participants in the Taglit Birthright Israel tours he funds for Jewish young people.</p> <p>The film's production and promotional campaign were bankrolled by the <a href=\"http://clarionfund.org/\">Clarion Fund</a>, an <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/873843.html\">obscure non-profit</a> that has not filed the required IRS form that would allow the public to see who its officers and major funders are. The group was founded, however, by Raphael Shore, an Israeli-Canadian citizen and supporter of John McCain. Shore's website, <a href=\"http://www.radicalislam.org/\">Radical Islam</a>, featured <a href=\"http://www.pennlive.com/news/patriotnews/index.ssf?/base/news/1221096322203370.xml&amp;coll=1\">an editorial endorsing McCain</a> for president. That's a big no-no: 501c3s aren't legally allowed to endorse candidates.</p> <p>The mass distribution of Obsession is an obvious Republican scare-tactic, right out of the Rovian playbook. Party operatives believe that scaring Americans into believing there's a jihadist under every bed will play to Republican strengths and Democratic weaknesses on national security. They swiftboated John Kerry in 2004. Now they're jihadising Barack Obama.</p> <p>To this end, Jewish voters in swing states have also been the targets of push polling from Republican-affiliated marketing outfits. Joelna Marcus of Key West, Florida <a href=\"http://nobloodforhubris.blogspot.com/2008/09/roveian-push-poll-targets-fl-voter-to.html\">received a telemarketing call</a> asking if she is Jewish. After replying \"yes\", she was asked whether she was religious. Then the push poller then asked her if her opinion of Barack Obama would change if she knew that Obama had given lots and lots of money to the PLO. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/Jewish_voters_complain_of_antiObama_poll.html?showall\">Debbie Minden received a call</a> asking whether her support for Obama would be swayed if she knew \"his church was anti-Israel\" or that Hamas endorsed him and that its leaders had met with him. The caller also asked if she would change her mind if she learned he was Muslim.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2008/09/15/i-just-got-push-polled-on-obama-and-israel.aspx\">New Republic's Jonathan Cohn also received a call</a> in Michigan and took notes of the smears: According to the caller, some of Obama's best friends in Chicago were \"pro-Palestinian leaders\"; Jimmy Carter's anti-Israel national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski is an Obama foreign policy adviser; Obama sat on a board which funded a \"pro-Palestinian charity\"; Obama said that if elected he would call for a summit of Muslim nations and exclude Israel.</p> <p>Minden reported that her call came from a firm called Research Strategies, which is none other than Wilson Research Strategies, whose founder is <a href=\"http://www.w-r-s.com/thefirm/wilson.php\">Chris Wilson</a>. Wilson is a top Republican consultant and friend of, you guessed it, <a href=\"http://wwwtmrcom.blogspot.com/2006/09/rove-top-fundraiser-to-visit-for.html\">Karl Rove</a>. Cohn said his call came from a company called Central Marketing, which has done push polls on behalf of the campaigns of Republicans John Thune and Michael Bloomberg. </p> <p>And Ben Smith reported last week that the Republican Jewish Coalition has <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13516.html\">admitted hiring the Republican telemarketing outfits</a> to do the push polling. Amazing how a little bit of sleuthing leads this filth right to the door of the Republican party.</p> <p>The way these things work, McCain has plausible deniability because the calls aren't made by his campaign. But they and the DVD are clearly designed to raise fears about national security and suppress Jewish turnout for Obama. If Republicans can reduce the number of Obama voters in key swing states by a few percentage points, they figure they strengthen McCain's chances of winning. This is American presidential politics at its most disgusting.</p>",

  "<p>Get ready for an interesting game of chicken coming up: How will Obama and McCain vote on the bailout package?</p> <p>The package will presumably have bipartisan support. If anything it will be opposed by more Republicans than Democrats probably, on free-market grounds. But some Democrats will consider a giveaway with too many protections for the big guys and not enough for the little people. This is what it in fact is, but only left-populist Democrats actually say things like that anymore, and there are comparatively few of those. They have to be from politically safe districts and states and not need Wall Street's campaign cash.</p> <p>But all this raises an interesting question for Obama, and it's a dilemma. Does he go populist here, and say \"I'm on the side of Main Street, not Wall Street,\" etc.? Or does he go conventional, following the Bob Rubin model of Democratic politics? There are upsides and downsides either way. Not all of them are clear yet.</p> <p>And of course it depends on what McCain does. The former McCain would obviously have gone along with the majority view and voted yes on a matter he's never really given a crap about anyway. But Mr. Say Anything Do Anything, who knows? He might vote against on <em>left-wing</em> grounds, trying to out-populist Obama! </p> <p>It's really a fascinating situation, into which is wrapped a lot of the intra-party tension within the Dems (populist v. corporatist) that has been put on the back burner during the Bush years but is sure to reemerge if Obama is elected. Tom Edsall has <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/22/the-economic-collapse-not_n_128152.html\">a very nice take on it all</a> at HuffPo.<br></p>",
  "<p>I've been wondering when someone was going to report this out. Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, was president for five years of the Homeownership Alliance, the chief lobbying operation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. For ensuring that the mortgage giants weren't subject to meddling regulations, he was paid $30,000 a month. David Kirkpatrick and Charles Duhigg <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/22/us/politics/22mccain.html?_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper&amp;oref=slogin\">raise the right questions</a> in the NYT today.</p> <p>So stop and dwell on this: While McCain has been out there lying about a relationship between Obama and Frank Raines, the former and disgraced CEO of F&amp;F, a relationship that does not exist in a way that anyone has proven, McCain's own top campaign adviser, a man he surely speaks with every day and who is helping to direct his response to this crisis, made $360,000 a year for five years to protect F&amp;F from federal intrusion.</p> <p>Davis offered this pearl of wisdom in 2000:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"You can say what you want about free-market distortions, but people like the system because it gets them into houses cheap,\" Mr. Davis said to Institutional Investor magazine in 2000, adding that he would run the advocacy group out of his Alexandria, Va., lobbying firm.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hasn't held up especially well. But that's the new McCain. Say anything, do anything.<br></p>",
  "<p>The masters of the universe have capitulated. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, Wall Street's last two big investment banks, want to turn themselves into boring commercial banks that accept deposits from ordinary people and businesses. The trade-off for tighter regulation is greater government protection.</p> <p>\"This development completes a sweeping transformation of Wall Street.<br>Now extinct are the specialised trading houses that broke off from<br>larger financial companies during the Great Depression, enterprises<br>that once prized their independence of regulation and exploited their<br>agility to make fortunes,\" the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/09/22/ST2008092200091.html?hpid=topnews\">Washington Post says.</a></p> <p>The New York Times also sees the move as a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/22/business/22bank.html?hp\">radical</a> change for Wall Street, with no more seven-figure bonuses and lavish perks for even mid-level executives.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It was a blunt acknowledgment that their model of finance and investing had become too risky and that they needed the cushion of bank deposits that had kept big commercial banks like Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase relatively safe amid the recent turmoil.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The Financial Times <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9c89aa3e-8807-11dd-b114-0000779fd18c.html\">sees bitter divisions in Congress</a> over the Bush<br>administration's $700bn (\u00a3380bn) scheme to bail out the financial<br>sector. Beneath the bipartisan rhetoric, it reports on anger among<br>Democrats and Republicans \"at what each saw as efforts by the other<br>side to use financial danger to bounce them into policy decisions\".</p> <p>Talking of bounces, the FT says the Sarah Palin bounce appears to have largely evaporated.</p> <p>As for the other political repercussions, in a week when Barack Obama and John McCain go head to head in their first televised debate, the verdict from commentators is that the Democratic hopeful has so far come out looking better, as reflected in his lead in the polls.</p> <p>The veteran political commentator <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/21/america/letter.php\">Albert Hunt, says in the International Herald Tribune</a> that detached observers \"were taken by how conversant and comfortable he [Obama] was on the subject, despite his thin record. Few detached observers came away with that impression watching the Arizona senator\".</p> <p>Investment bankers can expect no sympathy whatsoever from the Daily Mail's <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1059167/PETER-MCKAY-Why-punish-spivs.html\">Peter McKay who rounds on banking \"spivs\"</a> in his column. He writes that from his experience people in this line of work \"loathe those they see as welfare scroungers\".</p> <blockquote> <p>So let's treat them as a far worse species of societal leech, ones that expect to be paid for their crimes. Persecute them and discriminate against them.

  "<p>It's hard to think of many things that could shift the national focus in the United States away from the candidates in a presidential election, barely more than 40 days before the vote. But the meltdown on Wall Street, and the White House's multibillion-dollar bailout proposal, appeared to have done it. </p> <p>Over the weekend, both Barack Obama and John McCain were reduced to making cautiously positive noises about the proposal, which would raise the national debt ceiling to $11.3 trillion, allowing the US treasury unprecedented leeway to buy and sell debt. </p> <p>If McCain is to give his full-throated support to the plan, he must somehow square it with his reputation as a deregulator, and his eagerness not to identify too closely with the policies of George Bush. Meanwhile, the Washington Post <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/09/20/ST2008092002241.html\">reported at the weekend</a>, \"some Obama advisers conceded yesterday that they have concerns about how gingerly Obama has approached the crisis.\" </p> <p>Both campaigns have been forced to bulk up their economic teams, and to constantly review their economic messages, the paper said, while submitting to \"a crash course on the arcana of corporate finance: credit default swaps, naked short-selling and collateralized debt obligations.\"</p> <p>The Obama campaign saw one opportunity for attack on Saturday after the New York Times columnist Paul Krugman <a href=\" http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/mccain-on-banking-and-health/\">drew attention</a> to an article carrying McCain's byline, published in an obscure journal; in it, the Republican appeared to offer banking deregulation as an example that the healthcare industry should follow. \"So let me get this straight - he wants to run health care like they've been running Wall Street,\" Obama told one crowd. \"Well, Senator, I know some folks on Main Street who aren't going to think that's such a good idea\" - although several news organisations accused the Democrats of grossly oversimplifying the article's argument.</p> <p>Oh, and one more thing: all this weekend's talk of trillions made it seem like nothing, but the campaigns spent a record $94m during August, mainly on advertisements.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Over the weekend, the McCain campaign announced that Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and Alvaro Uribe of Colombia would be among the world leaders who will meet Sarah Palin at the UN General Assembly meeting in New York on Tuesday, in order to beef up her international relations experience. </p> <p>The same day, Obama will \"<a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/obama-sets-up-debate-camp-in-the-sunshine-state/\">sequester himself near Tampa Bay</a>\" in Florida, sources told the New York Times, to begin intensive preparation for Friday's debate with John McCain in Oxford, Mississippi, which will focus on foreign policy and national security. McCain's campaign says he has been preparing on-and-off for weeks, and won't take any days off the trail to get ready.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>In most major tracking polls over the weekend, Obama pulled further ahead of McCain by a small degree. In a Gallup poll released last night, though, the lead had narrowed again, with <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/110554/Gallup-Daily-Obama-Leading-McCain-Points.aspx\">Obama on 49% and McCain on 45%</a> among registered voters. <a href=\"http://www.electoral-vote.com/\">Electoral-vote.com</a>, which estimates the outcome of the election based on the latest state polls and taking into account the electoral college system, has Obama back in the lead at 273-265 after showing McCain in front last week - but state-level analyses tend to take a few days to catch up with reality, because state polls are less frequent.</p> <p>A troubling <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gehjsXjRU6cEer94pOkWWCmJEOAAD93B2O300\">AP-Yahoo poll</a>, meanwhile, found that one-third of Democrats \"harbor negative views toward blacks\" and that \"the percentage of voters who may turn away from Obama because of his race could easily be larger than the final difference between the candidates in 2004 - about 2.5 percentage points.\"</p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"This sticks in my craw. But it is, by far, the least costly way to proceed for the American economy, for the American people ... This is a humbling, humbling time for the United States of America, as we go around the world and talk to people about our financial system\" - US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, on Fox News on Sunday, tries to look on the bright side as the upper echelons of the US economy get reorganised along socialist principles.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/22/uselections2008.barackobama\">Michael Tomasky: The winner of the battle of the TV clips wins the White House</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/22/uselections2008.barackobama\">Candidates prepare for make or break presidential debates</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/21/uselections2008.barackobama\">Wall St woes help Obama overtake McCain express</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/sep/22/uselections2008.race\">On the road blog: Study looks at the role of race in the election</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/21/AR2008092102546.html?hpid=topnews\">Washington Post: Expansive role for 'First Dude'</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-money22-2008sep22,0,1726948.story\">Los Angeles Times: Obama outraises and outspends McCain</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/finance/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12281280&amp;source=features_box1\">Economist.com: Can Hank Paulson's rescue plan for Wall St do the job</a></p> <h2>Advice of the day</h2> <p>Aaron Sorkin imagines <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/opinion/21dowd-sorkin.html?bl&amp;ex=1222228800&amp;en=007cf9e8faaaf52a&amp;ei=5087%0A\">a meeting between Barack Obama and The West Wing's Josiah Bartlet</a>. \"Get angrier!\" the fictional president counsels. \"Call them liars, because that's what they are.

  "<p>How many billions of dollars do you need to squander before someone has to hold a proper press conference in Washington DC?</p> <p>I only ask, because after a week in which increasing amounts of taxpayers' money was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/22/business/22Markets.html\">pledged to prop up the US financial system</a>, not one of the major actors in the US administration could drag themselves in front of a podium to fully answer questions on the subject. It hardly seems value for money, does it?</p> <p>It's extraordinary: a blank cheque is being written, for perhaps $700bn or more, and no-one involved in writing that cheque has been prepared to go into a room full of journalists, stare into the TV cameras, and say: \"Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure you've all got many questions to ask\u2026.\"</p> <p>One example was last Thursday, after the US government had bailed out the AIG insurance company through an $85bn loan, and word was circulating of a further huge rescue package being readied. President Bush, at that moment of national peril, stirred himself to <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/09/20080918.html\">read a statement of 260 words</a>, lasting exactly two minutes \u2013 that's not an exaggeration, that is the length of time he spoke for: from 10.15am to 10.17am \u2013 of such banality that it doesn't bear repeating. (The highlight? \"Our financial markets continue to deal with serious challenges.\")</p> <p>In those two minutes President Bush neither sought nor answered a single question, as the stock market see-sawed, and hundreds of billions of dollars were being thrust into the markets by the Federal Reserve. The following day, however, President Bush did speak to the press \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/09/20080919-13.html\">alongside the championship-winning Boston Celtics basketball team</a>, for whom he found time to say more than 1,200 words. (But even that simple task he managed to screw up, of course, when he at one point referred to the team as the Boston Red Sox.)</p> <p>Hank Paulson, the Treasury secretary, did hold what was <a href=\"http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/hp1148.htm\">billed as a press conference</a> last Friday, in which he <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/business/1173504,091908paulsontrans.article\">read out a statement and took precisely three questions</a> before stalking out. He avoided answering any of the three in any detail, other than this one:</p> <blockquote> <p>Q: You said this seems to be of significant size. Are we talking hundreds of billions, a trillion dollars?<br>Secretary Paulson: No, we're talking hundreds of billions. This needs to be big enough to make a real difference and get at the heart of the problem.</p> </blockquote> <p>One ancient US senator is <a href=\"http://www.dirksencenter.org/print_emd_billionhere.htm\">alleged to have observed</a>: \"A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking real money.\" He obviously never met Hank Paulson, to whom talking hundreds of billions only merits a sentence or two.</p> <p>To be fair, Secretary Paulson only had to explain the meltdown on Wall Street and justify why hundreds of billions worth of government funds were being exposed in this way. So three questions would probably cover everything.</p> <p>By the end of the weekend Paulson had done the <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nationworld/politics/wire/sns-ap-paulson-full-ginsberg,0,1104224.story\">rounds of the Sunday morning TV talk shows</a>, in which he managed to say very little indeed, and the hosts were content to look grave rather than ask questions on subjects they knew nothing about. None of this stage-managed journalism is a good substitute for actually holding an open-ended press conference.</p> <p>No one should be surprised. This is the Bush administration we're talking about, upon whose tombstone history will write three place-names: Iraq, New Orleans, and now Wall Street. In each of these three events we can pick out the same pattern \u2013 initial incomprehension, a long period of stasis during which conditions got worse, an inability to adopt appropriate policies because of objections based on ideology, until finally, at vast expense, a resolution of some sort is stumbled upon. And in none of these instances has answering questions about the administration's conduct been a strong point.</p> <p>Indeed, the combined Wall Street bailouts are now matching the treasure spent on the war in Iraq. As Iraq showed, Wall Street will eventual improve, since there are few problems in the world that can't be helped by throwing hundreds of billions of dollars at them. (New Orleans is still waiting, though.)</p> <p>While George Bush doesn't want to hold any press conferences to discuss the crisis, plenty of other Republicans do. One senator, <a href=\"http://briansullivan.blogs.foxbusiness.com/2008/09/19/bunning-free-market-dead/\">Jim Bunning, made a statement worth reading</a> on several levels:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Instead of celebrating the Fourth of July next year Americans will be celebrating Bastille Day; the free market for all intents and purposes is dead in America,\" said Bunning. \"The action proposed today by the Treasury department will take away the free market and institute socialism in America. The American taxpayer has been mislead throughout this economic crisis. The government on all fronts has failed the American people miserably. My great-grandchildren will be saddled with the estimated $1 trillion debt left in the wake of this proposal. We have gotten to this point because nobody has been minding the store. Both Secretary Paulson and Chairmen [Ben] Bernanke should be held accountable for their inaction \u2013 and now because of that inaction \u2013 the American taxpayer is left with bill.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The last time he ran for re-election Bunning was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/29/uselections2004.usa5?commentpage=1\">forced to assure voters</a> that he was mentally fit to hold office. But even so, let me make clear: Bunning is a Republican senator from Kentucky.</p> <p>It can't be much fun being an incumbent Republican running in November. You have your president betraying your dearly-held free market beliefs, while your presidential candidate is roaming the country painting you as part of the corrupt swamp in Washington that caused the problem.</p> <p>And if no one from the administration is willing to turn up for a once-in-a-lifetime market meltdown, then who can blame <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/7816303\">Sarah Palin for avoiding anything resembling a press conference</a> \u2013 she's only running for vice president.</p>",
  "<p>Last night, while you were sleeping, did you dream of spangly dresses and glittering trophies? Did you toss and turn, nightmaring in a cold sweat that an orchestra was trying to cut your dream short before you'd reached your point?</p> <p>If so, it's likely that someone was actually beaming the 60th annual Emmy awards into your head. Which is, on reflection, quite unlikely indeed. So just in case that didn't happen for you, here's what you missed ...</p> <p>Well, metallics are big in the ballgown field this year, you'll be glad to hear. As are \"jewel colours\", whatever they may be, and also fringe. And we learnt all that even before the Emmys began, through the medium of the pre-awards red carpet show. In fact, some of it we learnt before that.</p> <p>[Sorry, if you're looking for a straight-up list of the Emmy winners best <a href=\"http://cdn.emmys.tv/awards/2008pte/60thpte_nomswin_pt.php?action=search_db#1\">go here</a>, because I'm not going to get there for a minute or two, if at all...]</p> <p>Because the interesting thing about it is that this was one of those award ceremonies so big that you not only had a pre-awards red carpet show, where people will talk to people about what dress they're wearing and whether they think they might win an award, but also a pre-red carpet, pre-award red-carpet show, show, live from the red carpet. In that, they talked about what dresses people MIGHT be wearing, and what they might say if asked whether they thought they might win an award or not.</p> <p>With such a build-up you always hope for a lot more than you get - some kind of small animals trained to dance to popular tunes while wearing costumes disguising them as popular television characters of the day.</p> <p>But no. In terms of hosting and a show, believe me, you didn't miss that much while you were sleeping. After last year's ceremony, where Pop Idol USA (oh, alright, American Idol, whatever) host Ryan Seacrest leapt from terrible punchiline to horrible pun, this year he was joined by four other reality show hosts - all of whom were nominated for outstanding reality or game show host - a brand new category and one whose name didn't involve the words, you'll note outstanding awards ceremony presenter'. And for damned good reason.</p> <p>They were terrible. Five hosts can never have struck anyone as a good idea - particularly with some who probably shouldn't be exposed to live television if it can be avoided (Heidi Klum, I love Project Runway more than I love rasberry jam, but I <em>am</em> looking at you, I'm afraid). And then, because the limping sketches and rambling introductions go on for so long (<em>nudge</em> - \"It's your line\" - <em>\"Oh! Anttha nonimees for outstanding ...\"</em>) that by the time they honour the people they're meant to be honouring, they only have a few seconds to talk before the orchestra starts playing the \"You're Boring\" song, and they get hustled off the stage by trophy women in pretty dresses.</p> <h2>Deserving winners</h2> <p>Still, there were a few memorable moments - and well deserved wins. Mad Men, in the first year eligible, may have been nominated 14 times and only won two, but they were two great ones - outstanding writing of a drama and best drama series. </p> <p>30 Rock won four awards, Tina Fey picking up three. She's getting very polished at acceptance speeches. And rightfully so, she's done a bunch - the first contained funny things about being a writer (\"The best thing about being an writer is that if you're at a wedding or something and someone asks what you do, they're less interested in talking to you if you say you're a writer than if you said you were an actor or something.\"), the second she thanked her parents for \"bestowing her with confidence disproportionate to my looks or ability, which is what all parents should do\" and in the third she pimped her show on every channel going, from Hulu to NBC.com, to phones to airlines to \"occasionally, an actual television\".</p> <p>Not everyone embraced new media. Barry Sonnenfeld picking up the Outstanding Directing in Comedy for Pushing Daisies used up the last precious seconds of speech time with the classic B-Movie line: \"love TV, fear the internet\". Yes. That's the way forward, Baz. Run away from inevitable change. Hug the past and ... oh, well, it is Pushing Daisies, I suppose.</p> <h2>Political animals</h2> <p>Politics made many appearances throughout - mainly in references to the upcoming election and the heartfelt pleas to vote. Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert - both winners for Outstanding comedy or variety things; Daily Show for best overall, Colbert Report for Best Writing. They struggled through each link and red carpet interview slyly insintuating what they do best (or just what they DO, full stop) as political gags clearly weren't on host ABC's agenda.</p> <p>For example, one of the many award winners for HBO miniseries John Adams - picking up the award for outstanding writing in a miniseries was getting to a point when he eulogised about being able to write about a time \"When articulate men articulated complex thoughts in complete sentences, and words like ...\" When suddenly \"COMING NEXT on the 60th Primetime Emmy awards! The Amazing Race! Iron chef! And so much more!\" cut in, shouting, and the commercial break arrived.</p> <p>Some things were missed. The Wire lost out on its last chance to win an Emmy - nominated for outstanding writing for the final episode of the final series. It didn't win - the Emmy for writing in a drama went instead to Mad Men. Which is also great. But it would have been nice to see The Wire win one, just one. They never have. Also, Battlestar Gallactica? Where was that? The same shows came up in every category, over and over again.</p> <p>John Adams, though, might be a tip to see for people who enjoyed previous HBO dramas like Rome etc. The winner of best actor in a miniseries was John Adams himself (not literally, it was the guy from Sideways, the real John Adams has been dead for ages). \"Thanks to HBO for giving me a job, for letting me play the president, and, for the kids at home, I'm living proof that anyone can play the president. Anybody. I'd like to thank ...\" list of writers, producers etc here \" ... and my wife ...\" the camera cut to his wife \"<em> ... not my real wife, I mean, my fake wife, Laura Linney ...</em>\" wife on cutaway camera looks a little alarmed. I mean, I can see where he was going with it - he was thanking the people involved in the show rather than particularly personal people ... but he's still going to be in trouble for that.</p> <p>Sometimes it was the things that you don't think about that surprised - the most marked thing about the outstanding writing in a comedy series is the fact that the list of nominees goes on for about 15 minutes. Since every comedy show has at least 12 writers and there are five shows nominated, it just goes on and on and on, and the true battle seemed to be who can make the VT accompanying their list of their writers the funniest. That was a tie between The Colbert Report and The David Letterman show. The Colbert Report won the prize though. Most outstanding whatever it was.</p> <p>Most outstanding? What does that mean, over and above \"best\"? It just makes me think of the joke about the scarecrow. You know: Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was out standing in his field.</p> <p>Ahem. The whole thing limped on - some results you were pleased to hear, some a little more baffling (and only occasionally because they've not made it to Britain at all) and in between always these shuddering, stuttering lame links. </p> <p>The best by far, of course, being the one being the one that began; \"Television is a very American invention ...\" What? In cultural terms? Societal terms? Not, like, literal technical terms, right? Because John Logie... ah, forget it.</p> <h2>Here come the Brits</h2> <p>Anway, speaking of proper recognition for British for their contribution to television: Ricky Gervais was ever-present, not only nominated multiple times for the Extras series finale, but also presenting an award, a guide to award speeches, and possibly the funniest award moment of the night with Steve Carrell, when his VT ended in the moment when Steve Carrell picked up the trophy for him last year. \"Look at his stupid little face\" says Gervais ... which then lead into a four-minute barracking of Carrell in which he demanded his Emmy back from a straight-faced Carrell in the front row. Which, in true Gervais form, was funny, got a bit uncomforable and then turns out to be a joke. Obviously. </p> <p>More British wins - Tom Wilkinson won, for John Adams. Hurrah, Marmite, yorkshire puddings and God save the Queen, etc.</p> <p>Eileen Atkins for Cranford - but she couldn't be there either. These may be the most prestigious television awards in the world, as we keep being told, but none of the Brits bothered to turn up. Probably had better things to do, I feel sure. Picking their dresses out for the Baftas, perhaps. Even Tom Wilkinson, yes.</p> <p>Most importantly, the trailer for the US Life on Mars aired during the break, though it's not being aired until October, still. First thoughts? No real gags contained in the trailer, apart from one so impaired by Harvey Keitel's mumbling as to render it not really that funny. Still, mind open, opinions unformed, I'll get back to you when I've actually seen it.</p> <p>But the important questions belonged to the stars of US prime time. What WERE they wearing? Was Eva Longoria a little bit pregnant or just a little bit fat (oh come on, clearly pregnant)? If metallics are so very in, can we expect to see anyone turning up in a full suit of armour (no, sadly)? And most importantly, if it's fine to dissect every inch of what the ladies are wearing, why not the gentlemen? Because my GOODNESS Jeremy Piven was wearing enough manscara to sink a really butch spider. And Tom Hanks? I haven't seen him in a while, but ...</p> <p>Now, I have a long-standing problem with Tom Hanks as it is, but I could not anyway get through this without mentioning the bizarre hair-hat he seems to be wearing. Is it a hair transplant? Is it a really long mullet that's been swept-forward and then swept back in the most complex comb-over ever? Or is he actually wearing a hat made of hair? A hair-hat?</p> <p>Honestly, if there are going to be two red-carpet shows, could they not make time for one dodgy-rug show as well?</p>",
  "<p>On my post of the results of a poll on which presidential candidates <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/sep/20/uselections2008.useconomy\">Americans would prefer to have over to watch the football game</a>, commenter StMichaelTraveler said:</p> <blockquote> <p>This is just part of the total answer. The major part is whether many older blue-colored workers, older under-educated women, and fundamentalists Christians can accept a highly qualified part black American as their president.</p> <p>Since 1950, we Americans have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go to free ourselves from the yoke of our prejudices. If Senator McCain wins this election, it would be greatly the result of our prejudice. If then, we should stop calling ourselves the leader of the free world, when we still have subjugated a major part of our society?</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, look here. Cue the researchers at Stanford University. They wanted to find out <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/page/election-2008-political-pulse-obama-race\">why Barack Obama didn't have a larger lead</a> in the polls despite President Bush's unpopularity, upset over the war in Iraq and Democrats' advantages on the economy. Barack Obama's Democrats have even registered more voters for the election in November.</p> <blockquote> <p>The poll, conducted with Stanford University, suggests that the percentage of voters who may turn away from Obama because of his race could easily be larger than the final difference between the candidates in 2004 \u2014 about two and one-half percentage points.</p> </blockquote> <p>The study suggested that \"Obama's support would be as much as 6 percentage points higher if there were no white racial prejudice\".</p> <p>Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight.com says not so fast. He says that it's <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/09/on-race-based-voting.html\">irresponsible to cite the study without subjecting the study to peer review.</a> But he also challenges some of the received wisdom that has grown up around Barack Obama and the impact of his race. Nate's points 2 and 4 seem the most compelling to me.</p> <blockquote> <p>2. The study appears to be one of all adults, rather than registered or likely voters. Expressions of racial prejudice have a strong inverse correlation with education levels, and so do turnout rates. Therefore, even if it is true that Barack Obama's race puts him at something like a 6-point disadvantage with the population as a whole, the margin is probably more like 4-5 points among likely voters.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>4. One should be very careful not to confuse a study like this with the Bradley Effect. Of course some people are racist, and will vote against Obama because he is black -- I have met some of them. But the Bradley Effect concerns something different -- whether such people are likely to lie about their behavior to pollsters. There is <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/08/persistent-myth-of-bradley-effect.html\">simply</a> <a href=\"http://people.iq.harvard.edu/%7Edhopkins/wilder13.pdf\">no</a> <a href=\"http://www.themonkeycage.org/2008/08/an_obama_effect_part_iii.html\">empirical</a> <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/polls/tn/06-tn-sen.php\">evidence</a> that the Bradley Effect exists any longer. It did not exist in the primaries, and it did not exist in the 2006 Senate race in Tennessee, which was perhaps the most racially-tinged contest of the past decade (in fact, Harold Ford slightly outperformed the late polls).</p> </blockquote> <p>As Nate pointed out in a previous post, <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/08/persistent-myth-of-bradley-effect.html\">Obama actually beat his polling numbers</a> in every region except the Northeast, states near New York, which Hillary Clinton represents in the Senate.</p> <p>Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/BarackObama\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">BarackObama</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/race\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">race</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/polls\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">polls</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/prejudice\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">prejudice</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/politics\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">politics</a></p>"
