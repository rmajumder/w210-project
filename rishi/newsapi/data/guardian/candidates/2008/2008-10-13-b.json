  "<p>The Republican US presidential candidate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> was not tortured during his captivity in North Vietnam, the chief prison guard of the jail in which he was held has claimed.</p> <p>In an interview with the Italian daily Corriere della Sera, Nguyen Tien Tran acknowledged that conditions in the prison were \"tough, though not inhuman\". But, he added: \"We never tortured McCain. On the contrary, we saved his life, curing him with extremely valuable medicines that at times were not available to our own wounded.\"</p> <p>McCain, who fell into enemy hands after his plane was shot down in 1967, has frequently referred to being tortured and has cited his experiences as a reason for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/nov/10/usa.mainsection\">vigorously opposing</a> the endorsement by the Bush administration of the use of techniques such as \"water-boarding\" on terrorist suspects.</p> <p>Shortly after his release in 1973 McCain told US News &amp; World Report that his prison guards had beaten him \"from pillar to post\". After being worked over at intervals for four days, he said, he had become suicidal and agreed to sign a \"confession\" admitting to war crimes.</p> <p>In his 1999 autobiography, Faith of My Fathers, he described how after his capture he was subjected to inhuman treatment in an effort to force him to disclose his ship's name, squadron number and the target of his final mission. He was threatened with the withdrawal of medical assistance and, while still suffering from his crash injuries, his guards \"knocked me around a little\".</p> <p>For his service in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/vietnam\">Vietnam</a> and his actions as a POW, McCain was awarded the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, the Navy Commendation Medal and the Purple Heart.</p> <p>Tran, now 75, said McCain reached Hanoi with the worst injuries he had seen in a downed pilot. But he denied torturing him, saying it was his mission to ensure that McCain survived. As the son of the US naval commander in Vietnam, he offered a potential valuable propaganda weapon.</p> <p>However, recommending McCain for a medal after the war, his former cellmate, the much-decorated Colonel George Day, said the admiral's son had forced his interrogators to \"drug him and torture him to get any cooperation\", according to a letter in the US National Archives cited earlier this year by the Washington Post. Day said McCain suffered \"torturous abuse\".</p> <p>Tran told Corriere that McCain was sent to hospital the day after he was brought to Hanoi and stayed there for a month. \"I never lost him from sight. I was frightened a doctor or nurse might do him harm.\"</p> <p>Tran dismissed as \"absolutely impossible\" perhaps the most famous story from McCain's autobiography: that one Christmas, a guard traced a cross in the mud in front of him. \"My men were all communists and atheists,\" he said.</p> <p>As to why McCain, then 36, left North Vietnam with prematurely grey hair, Tran denied it was because of mistreatment. \"It's that in prison you think too much.\"</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338563358\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>John McCain, trailing even in the once solid Republican south, tried to rekindle his appeal as a military hero and man of honour yesterday, casting himself as the struggling underdog against <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>.</p> <p>Down in the polls and derided by conservative commentators, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/johnmccain\">McCain</a> chose this area with a large military population to spur his followers to keep their faith in his candidacy - mostly by affecting bravado at the very real prospect of defeat.</p> <p>\"We have 22 days to go. We're six points down. The national media has written us off. Senator Obama is measuring the drapes,\" he told a large crowd packed into a convention centre. \"My friends, we've got them just where we want them.\"</p> <p>McCain's latest reinvention comes after a disastrous three-week slide that has seen the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/audio/2008/oct/13/mccain-presidential-troopergate-race\">Republican flailing around</a> for a message that will connect in this time of economic crisis. His campaign team had originally planned to announce a new economic plan yesterday but, after some confusion, finally opted to do it today. That allowed Obama to introduce his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/13/uselections2008-barackobama-economy-speech\">own economic proposals</a> unchallenged.</p> <p>McCain also <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/13/uselections2008-johnmccain\">lurched away from the increasingly negative tone</a> of last week's rallies, after commentators accused him of coming dangerously close to stoking racist feelings against Obama.</p> <p>But the problem now for McCain is how to keep the hardcore supporters onside without firing up their emotions.</p> <p>A Washington Post/ABC national poll yesterday put Obama on 53% to McCain's 43%. In a survey of scores of Republican strategists conducted by the National Journal over the weekend, 80% said they expected Obama to win, compared with only 17% three weeks ago.</p> <p>Despite the recent criticism of McCain, there was plenty of fight in yesterday's crowd. Many people in the crowd said they wanted McCain to go even harder after Obama, saying the Republican should continue to bring up the Democrat's links to the 60s era radical William Ayers.</p> <p>Some said McCain should also keep hitting Obama over his pastor, the Rev Jeremiah Wright, and his links to community organisers the Republicans accuse of committing voter fraud. \"How about just going after him?\" said Joe Kohm.</p> <p>It was hard to miss the current of anger, with the chants of \"Nobama\" and the home-made signs saying things like \"True Patriots\".</p> <p>One military man carried a sign saying: \"I will not re-enlist if Obama is elected.\" A heckler yelled: \"Obama is no good for the country.\"</p> <p>Sarah Palin tapped right into that feeling. \"We know that all across America right now there is a lot of anger,\" she said. \"There is anger about the insider dealing of lobbyists and anger about the greed on Wall Street and anger about the arrogance of the Washington elite and anger about voter fraud.\"</p> <p>Yesterday was only McCain's second appearance in Virginia, a reflection of his confidence that the state was secure. But, as McCain himself acknowledged yesterday, even Virginia - which voted Republican for the past 10 presidential elections - was in danger of slipping away.</p> <p>The Republican tried to assure the crowd that he would never give up, recalling his years as a prisoner in the Vietnam war. \"I know what fear feels like. It's a thief in the night who robs your strength. I know what hopelessness feels like. It's an enemy who defeats your will,\" he said. \"I felt those things once before. I will never let them in again.\"</p> <p>But the Democrats are advancing not only in Virginia, but in North Carolina. McCain has now been overtaken in the state, which he visited later yesterday.</p> <p>The turnabout in Democratic fortunes in the once reliable Republican terrain comes after a marathon organising effort, and a huge investment in advertising. Obama and his vice-president, Joe Biden, have visited eight times between them, with Bill Clinton making two appearances on Sunday.</p> <p>On local television Obama campaign ads pop up in every programming break, outlining his economic plan, offering tax cuts, and outnumbering McCain advertisements by about five to one.</p> <p>The McCain campaign's single television ad focuses on Obama's association with Ayers. The Republican National Committee yesterday released yet another video on the Ayers connection intended not for broadcast but viral emails.</p> <p>That appears to be having some traction. \"I'm scared of Obama - from what I have read and his associations which are questionable, his so-called terrorist associations, and even his church,\" said Lori Raynor, a biochemist. \"I just don't think he can run this country.\" She added: \"Some of my friends have even told me they think he is the anti-Christ.\"</p> <p>Others remained convinced that Obama was a Muslim, even while criticising his choice of church for the past 20 years. \"I believe he has had a Muslim upbringing, but his wife is a Christian,\" said Scott Wallace, a physician's assistant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338566655\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/10/14/US_BLACK_POLL_1410.gif\" alt=\"Graphic - US voters and a black president\" width=\"460\" height=\"271\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>",
  "<p>John Duffey shakes his head as he recalls bruising racial encounters with his fellow Americans. From morning to night since May he has been working the phones on behalf of Barack Obama.</p> <p>\"People say, 'I like the guy. I like what he stands for. I like his plans, vision, but I am still undecided.' That has to be the race issue,\" says Duffey. </p> <p>Others say outright they will not vote for a black man.</p> <p>Duffey, an official with the Construction Workers' Union, works alongside his wife, daughter and two nephews at a phone bank in the headquarters of the United Steelworkers of America, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. An African-American, he said: \"It is actually a hurtful feeling that in 2008 people can't get over the race issue.\"</p> <p>In another room Kaitlin Decero, a 22-year-old intern from Indiana, is also on the phone on behalf of Obama. The team she works with averages about 300 calls an hour and race comes up a lot. </p> <p>People who have voted Democrat in the past tell her they will not be doing so this time. \"Some people will say openly, 'he is a black', 'I do not trust him', 'he is an Arab', 'he is a Muslim', 'he was not born in America'. They use the 'n-word'. We just hang up.\" Decero puts the ratio of bad calls to good at about 1 in 20.</p> <p>The impact of race is the big unknown in this election. The lingering fear among Democrats is that 2008 will be a repeat of 1982 - and subsequent races involving black candidates - when Tom Bradley lost the California governor's contest in spite of polls suggesting he had a lead of between 9% and 22%. White voters had lied in huge numbers to pollsters about their real feelings.</p> <p>Pollsters now believe the so-called \"Bradley effect\" has largely disappeared, partly because polling techniques are better at detecting racism and partly because of a cultural change in America, with those under the ago of 50 less concerned about race than their parents.</p> <p>Scott Keeter, of the Washington-based Pew Research Centre for the People and the Press, which conducts regular surveys on cultural attitudes, said: \"I would not say that the [Bradley] effect is gone completely, but I think it will be substantially smaller than in the past, if it appears at all. [But] I think it's prudent to acknowledge that we are at least partially in uncharted waters ... this is our first general election with an African-American nominee.\"</p> <p>There was serious concern among the Obama campaign a month ago that, with polls showing him in a dead heat with his Republican opponent John McCain, lack of enthusiasm on the part of blue-collar white voters in swing states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Michigan might cost him the election. That concern has since diminished because of the economic crisis that is pushing undecideds behind Obama.</p> <p>Mike Harms, an Amalgamated Transit Union official and one of the organisers of the phone banks in Pittsburgh, said: \"I do believe people are beginning to see that the only colour that matters in this election is green [the dollar]. When it comes to pocketbook issues, people will put race behind them.\"</p> <p>Canvassers in Pittsburgh's working-class neighbourhoods - which have been among the most resistant to Obama - confirm that while there are still a lot of undecideds, support for him is on the rise. But, as in other states with big concentrations of blue-collar white workers, this is more a vote against the Republicans than a vote for Obama.</p> <p>As those campaigners who have been targeting union members elsewhere in the US have found, supporters leafleting outside the Anchor Hocking Glass Company in Beaver Falls, outside Pittsburgh, at 6am, encountered a sullen response, not entirely due to the early hour.</p> <p>Their leaflet directly confronted concerns about Obama, saying the election was about economic issues, health and union rights and \"not about fear ... anti-American, black, celebrity, elitist, Muslim, terrorist\". Many of the glass workers refused to take a leaflet. Some screwed up their faces when they saw the canvassers' Obama T-shirts. </p> <p>Leading the canvassers was Jason Altmire, a Democratic congressman for the district who is up for re-election on November 4. </p> <p>He described the first hour outside the gate as \"the worst response we have seen in a long time\". Having Obama on the ticket did not help him in the district, he said, adding he was concerned about the impact of canvassing alongside people in Obama T-shirts.</p> <p>Wayne Boyer, a 54-year-old African-American salesman and an Obama supporter, said racism was evident in the way that white Americans clung to their wallets when they saw him walking down the street. The fear among them, he said, was that, as president, Obama \"is going to push black values\".</p> <p>Obama's inner circle plays down race, apart from when it was forced to deal with the Reverend Jeremiah Wright row earlier this year. Talking about race, they believe, will cost Obama votes. They also hope the number of people who will vote against him because he is black will be outweighed by young and African-American voters. </p> <p>But Claire McCaskill, the Missouri senator who has been with Obama from the start, admitted last week: \"You can't be involved in this election without feeling unease about race in this country.\"</p> <p>Racism in northern cities and rural areas can be as virulent as in the south. Tom Tuttle, 60, a white security guard and Vietnam veteran who is undecided, told canvassers in Brookline, a working-class area in Pittsburgh, that racism was common in the city. \"It is an underlying racism. At least down south you knew they hated them. Here people have to do it behind their backs ... I think seriously someone will kill the man.\"</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338563358\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p><br>Barack Obama sought to build on his commanding poll lead over John McCain yesterday by setting out a $60bn (\u00a335bn) rescue plan aimed at creating more jobs and easing the burden on US households suffering from the economic turmoil.</p> <p>In an echo of the New Deal in the 1930s, Obama proposed embarking on programmes to repair bridges, roads, schools and other infrastructure projects that have been on hold for decades.</p> <p>To provide immediate relief for struggling families he suggested allowing people to dip into their retirement funds and imposing a three-month moratorium on mortgage foreclosures. Obama said his plan should be implemented immediately and would not have to wait until a new president takes over on January 20.</p> <p>The Democratic candidate was seeking to command the issue that could decide the election. Neither he nor McCain have yet put forward solutions to the crisis that have resonated with voters. Analysts say the first candidate to do so will hold the key to victory.</p> <p>Obama announced his plan, which was worked out over the past few weeks with a battery of former US treasury staff and other advisers, in what his campaign team called a major economic speech in Toledo, Ohio. He put the emphasis on creating new jobs after forecasts of 8% unemployment by the end of the year. </p> <p>\"It's a plan that begins with one word that's on everyone's mind, and it's spelled J-O-B-S,\" he said, urging the White House and Congress to implement his plans immediately.</p> <p>\"We can't wait to help workers and families and communities who are struggling right now - who don't know if their job or their retirement will be there tomorrow; who don't know if next week's pay cheque will cover this month's bills.</p> <p>\"We need to pass an economic rescue plan for the middle class and we need to do it now. Today, I'm proposing a number of steps that we should take immediately to stabilise our financial system, provide relief to families and communities, and help struggling homeowners.\"</p> <p>To help create jobs, Obama proposed a $3,000 job tax credit for every new employee a company takes on over the next two years. He said 1m new jobs could be saved by creating a fund to provide money to states and local communities to rebuild and repair roads, bridges, schools and other infrastructure projects. </p> <p>In a rare acknowledgement of a good idea from the opposing camp, Obama, appealing to independents who tend to dislike partisan politics, welcomed McCain's plan for changing pension regulations so that people are not penalised by low stock market prices. \"I think that's a good idea, but I think we need to do even more,\" Obama said.</p> <p>His plan to allow people to raid their pension funds would allow families to \"get through this crisis without being forced to make painful choices like selling their homes or not sending their kids to college\".</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and the Democrats are stealing the election. Massive voter fraud is being carried out, even as we speak, by their henchmen, known by the innocuous sounding Association for Community Organisations for Reform Now, or Acorn. Clever bastards.<br> The only problem? Despite the screaming wall-to-wall coverage of \"Democratic voter fraud in 11 swing states\" as seen on Fox News and even the once-respectable CNN, none of it's true. None of it.</p> <p>In just the last week, we've had a phoney <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6480\">stunt raid in swing state Nevada</a> (where Acorn had been cooperating with officials for months, concerning problem canvassers they'd long ago fired); a Republican election official in swing state Missouri tell <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6487\">Fox News</a> that she's being <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6488\">beseiged</a> with fraudulent registration forms from Acorn (in a county where they've not done any registration work since August); a Republican sheriff in swing state Ohio, who, the very next day, <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6493\">suddenly requested</a> the names and addresses of hundreds of early voters (with evidence of exactly zero wrong doing, but lots of Democratic-leaning college student in the particular county, and John McCain's state campaign chair as a partner in the investigation); and a screaming front page headline <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/seven/10092008/news/politics/nuts__132771.htm\">in Rupert Murdoch's New York Post</a> about a guy who claims he was somehow tricked by Acorn into registering 72 times (but read the article closely to note he says he registered at the same address each time, which, even if true, would allow him - you guessed it - precisely one legal vote.)</p> <p>It's an old Republican scam, but it's never been carried out with more zeal than this year. The Republicans have been putting so much time, money and resources into the propaganda leading up to this <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/ACVR\">over the last four years</a>, we should have expected no less. <br> As luck would have it, the Democrats have a man who, as an attorney years ago, actually had the temerity to join the US department of justice in representing Acorn in a successful lawsuit, forcing the state of Illinois to follow the law by allowing citizens to register to vote at the department of motor vehicles. What a scoundrel. That, of course, was before the department of justice, under George Bush's corrupt command, would itself become politicised by the very Republicans so desperate to keep low-income voters from voting, that they were willing to fire their own US attorneys for failing to bring phoney charges of voter fraud in key swing states like Nevada and Missouri. So what are the crimes that have caused all the Sturm und Drang on US television and talk radio, and in several otherwise respectable newspapers and even by the McCain campaign itself? The only actual crime here is that Acorn <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6503\">managed to register</a> some 1.3m low-income (read: Democratic-leaning) voters over the past two years. The rest is, pretty much, just made up.<br> But in the bloody and desperate trenches of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/20/uselections2008.civilliberties\">Republican war on democracy</a>, that's more than enough to kick in a last minute surge of lies that may - with the help of a compliant and lazy corporate US media - wreak enough havoc, scare enough voters, confuse enough people and plant enough seeds to call an Obama victory into doubt on November 4.<br> If you can't win it, steal it. If you can't steal it, claim the other guy stole it. If you can't claim the other guy stole it (yet), say they're about to and then kick up smoke that maybe someone will believe you. (Heckuva job, CNN.) Here are the facts. Acorn verifies the legitimacy of every registration its canvassers collect. If they can't authenticate the registration, or it's incomplete or questionable in other ways, they flag that form as problematic (\"fraudulent\", \"incomplete\", et cetera). They then hand in all registration forms, even the problematic ones, to elections officials, as they are required to do by law. In almost every case where you've heard about fraud by Acorn, it's because Acorn itself notified officials about the fraud that's been perpetrated on them by rogue canvassers. Most officials who run to the media screaming \"Acorn is committing fraud\" know all of the above but don't bother to share those facts with the media they've run to. None of this is about voter fraud. None of it. Where any fraud has occurred, it's voter registration fraud and has resulted in exactly zero fraudulent votes. You'll hear that Donald Duck, Mary Poppins, Dick Tracy, Mickey Mouse and (new this year) the <a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/332/story/958266.html\">starting lineup of the Dallas Cowboys</a> football team have all had fraudulent registrations submitted in their names. That's true. And we know this, why? Because Acorn told officials about it when they followed the law and turned in those registrations, flagged as fraudulent.<br> What you won't hear is that federal law requires anybody who does not register to vote in person at the county office to show an ID when they go to vote the first time. So, unless Donald Duck shows up with his ID, he won't be voting this November. You needn't worry, no matter how much even <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCB-wGSRzVc\">John McCain himself</a> cynically and dishonourably tries to mislead you.<br> If it quacks like a duck, in this case, it's likely another Republican Acorn voter fraud lie. They haul it out every two years.</p> <p>Just days before the 2004 presidential election, rightwing whack job Michelle Malkin claimed that Acorn was registering terrorists to vote in swing state Ohio. Problem was, <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200410270005\">that was a lie</a>.<br> In 2006, again just days before the election, the new US attorney in swing state Missouri (recently appointed, since the one before him refused to bring such charges), filed voter fraud indictments against Acorn workers in the state. Problem was, bringing election-related indictments that close to an election was a violation of the department of justice's own written policy. And Acorn had nothing to do with it, other than turning in the employees to officials. Getting the picture? It's a hoax. All of it. But it's been an effective one, as it's served to distract from very real concerns about tens of thousands of voters who have been illegally purged from the voting rolls in dozens of states, as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/us/politics/09voting.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=all\">the New York Times reported</a> in a remarkable front page investigative story. That story followed a report the week before <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6453\">from CBS News</a> detailing still more wholesale purges of voting rolls in some 20 states.<br> That will be the November surprise, when thousands, if not millions show up to vote only to find they are no longer welcome to do so and are forced to vote on a \"provisional ballot\" which may or may not be counted. These real concerns of election fraud, such as voting roll purges, <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6497\">electronic voting machines that don't work</a> and so much more that actually matters, have been obscured by the smoke and mirrors and sleight of hand of the Republican party's phoney Acorn voter fraud charade.<br> And where they can, they'll parlay it all into new photo ID restrictions at the polls (knowing full well that some 20m, largely Democratic-leaning voters don't own the type of ID they'd need to jump over that next Republican hurdle.) Yet, with all of the unsubstantiated, wholly bogus claims of voter fraud being carried out by Democrats, there remains at least one case of absolutely ironclad, documented, yet still-unprosecuted case of voter fraud that, for some reason, Republicans don't much like to talk about.</p> <p>We can only <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6046\">wonder why</a>.</p>",
  "<p>He might have <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canadavotes/story/2008/09/30/rae-harper.html?ref=rss\">plagiarised a speech</a> from the former prime minister of Australia, but Stephen Harper still has a long way to go before he becomes Canada's equivalent to John Howard. The recent news that Harper copied a speech written for Howard on the eve of the Iraq war was more than a superficial political gaffe: it was a reminder of how Howard's 11 years in power <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/11/australia.barbaramcmahon\">almost destroyed Australia's reputation</a> as a progressive nation \u2013 and that Harper could do the same if his Conservative party is elected to a majority tomorrow.</p> <p>Thankfully, it doesn't look like this will be happening any time soon. Widely expected to win a majority when he <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canadavotes/story/2008/09/07/parties-campaigns.html?ref=rss\">announced the election five weeks ago</a>, the most recent national polls are now showing that Harper will return to parliament with only another minority government. Polls published today in the Globe &amp; Mail newspaper show that <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081013.welectionpolls13/BNStory/Front\">Harper's party is down three points from its popular vote in 2006</a>, and that, unlike the election two years ago, this time voters who favour the NDP and Green party are more likely to stick to these preferences than they were in 2006.</p> <p>The leader of the rival Liberal party <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/FederalElection/article/516369\">recently branded Harper a \"quitter\"</a>, but the Liberals themselves are faring little better. Most polls are placing their support at around 26% or 27%, and far fewer NDP and Green party supporters have shifted to the Liberals in the closing days of the election than were expected. With no sudden surge in support for the Bloc Quebecois, the NDP or the Liberals, it almost seems as though Canadians are voting for the party they dislike the least, giving no party a real mandate to lead.</p> <p>So what happened to Harper's assured majority? At first glance, the economy is the obvious answer. The Economist magazine argued last week that, while Canada has been protected from the worst of the economic crisis so far, fears in the country have been overblown by <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/world/americas/displayStory.cfm?source=hptextfeature&amp;story_id=12380857\">Canada's exposure to America's alarmist media</a>, which Stephan Dion, the Liberal leader, has harnessed to create a kind of meta-economic crisis in the absence of a real one.</p> <p>The Economist is unduly dismissive of Canadian concerns. <a href=\"http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/business/story.html?id=87587bd1-bbeb-4840-b74f-b1eff72b54a3\">Economic worries are certainly very real to many Canadians</a>, particularly outside of Alberta. Rising food prices and declining access to credit have hit hard, as they have elsewhere, in addition to problems caused by the strong Canadian dollar last year, which damaged trade with the US, the country that buys the vast majority of Canadian exports. The idea that Canadians have concerns about their economy because of their overexposure to American media, and not because of their country's dependency on trade with the US, is a dubious thesis at best.</p> <p>But although Canadians' economic concerns are real, they don't fully account for Harper's declining support before the election. With the Greens the only party very visibly making gains, the most recent polls suggest a nation that doesn't want to give Harper any more power but hasn't yet forgiven <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/29/international/americas/29canada.html\">the corruption of the Liberals</a> in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Perhaps some Canadian citizens even enjoy having a minority government, a less extreme form of co-habitation like in France, where the downside of gridlock is countered by the advantage that no one party can effect too much damaging change because they can effect little change at all.</p> <p>This belies Harper's own record as minority prime minister, where, despite his precarious position in parliament, he <a href=\"http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070622/harper_kyoto_070622/20070622?hub=Politics\">managed to renege on the Kyoto agreement and commit Canadian troops to Afghanistan</a> for an additional two years, to 2011. With another minority government, he could doubtless continue his incremental infringement on civil liberties and environmental issues, but he won't have sufficient clout to be a full-blown John Howard, at least.</p> <p>There is, of course, a temptation to see tomorrow's vote as a test case for the November 4 election in the US, a temptation which runs the risk of dismissing Canada as a practice-America, but which can't be avoided altogether either. Even many Canadian news outlets are devoting as much time to the Obama-McCain race and the economic crisis as they are to covering their own election, and it will be the first western post-economic crisis election of 2008, unless you count Austria, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/30/austria\">recent votes for right-wing extremists</a> are simply too alarming to contemplate, and too country-specific to extrapolate any general post-economic crisis voting patterns.</p> <p>If Harper doesn't win a majority, is this an indicator that Americans will vote against conservatives and an unregulated economy on November 4 as well? Perhaps, but it ignores the domestic dynamics of the main Canadian parties and the specifics of Harper's and Dion's campaign mistakes. If he only attains a minority government tomorrow, the economic crisis will likely be Harper's justification for his low levels of support, but the cracks were there long before the talk of global economic downturn. Either way, after tomorrow, the rest of Canada will at least have one less thing to furtively worry over as they read their morning newspapers: two elections and a global crisis are just too much to keep up with at once.</p>",

  "<p>John McCain, trailing even in the once solid Republican south, tried to rekindle his appeal as a military hero and man of honour today, casting himself as the struggling underdog against Barack Obama.</p> <p>Down in the polls and derided by conservative commentators, McCain chose<br>this heavily military area to try to spur his followers to keep their faith in his candidacy - mostly by affecting bravado at the very real prospect of defeat.</p> <p>\"We have 22 days to go. We're 6 points down. The national media has written us off. Senator Obama is measuring the drapes,\" he told a large crowd packed into a convention centre. \"My friends, we've got them just where we want them.\"</p> <p>McCain's latest reinvention comes after a disastrous three-week slide that has seen the Republican flailing around for a message that will connect in this age of economic crisis.</p> <p>He scrapped the idea of coming out with a new economic plan yesterday - allowing Obama to introduce his own economic proposals unchallenged.</p> <p>McCain also lurched away from the increasingly negative tone of last week's<br>rallies, after commentators accused him of coming dangerously close to<br>stoking racist feelings against Obama.</p> <p>But the problem now for McCain is how to keep the hardcore supporters<br>on-side without firing up their emotions.</p> <p>A Washington Post/ABC national poll today put Obama on 53% to McCain's 43%. In a survey of scores of Republican strategists conducted by the National Journal over the weekend, 80% said they expected Obama to win, compared with only 17% three weeks ago.</p> <p>Despite the recent criticism of McCain, there was plenty of fight in today's crowd. Many people in the crowd said they wanted McCain to go even harder after Obama, saying the Republican should continue to bring up the Democrats' links to the 1960s-era radical William Ayers.</p> <p>Some said McCain should also keep hitting Obama over his pastor, the Rev<br>Jeremiah Wright, and his links to community organisers the Republicans accuse of committing voter fraud. \"How about just going after him,\" said Joe Kohm.</p> <p>It was hard to miss the current of anger, with the chants of \"Nobama\" and<br>the home-made signs saying things like \"True Patriots\". One military man<br>carried a sign saying: \"I will not re-enlist if Obama is elected.\"</p> <p>A heckler yelled: \"Obama is no good for the country.\"</p> <p>Sarah Palin tapped right into that feeling. \"We know that all across America right now there is a lot of anger,\" she said. \"There is anger about the insider dealing of lobbyists and anger about the greed on Wall Street and anger about the arrogance of the Washington elite and anger about voter fraud.\"</p> <p>Today was only McCain's second appearance in Virginia, a reflection of his confidence that the state was secure.</p> <p>But, as McCain himself acknowledged today, even Virginia - which has voted for Republican presidents for the last 10 elections - was in danger of slipping away.</p> <p>The Republican tried to assure the crowd that he would never give up - recalling his years as a prisoner in the Vietnam war. \"I know what fear feels like. It's a thief in the night who robs your strength. I know what hopelessness feels like. It's an enemy who defeats your will,\" he said. \"I felt those things once before. I will never let them in again.\"</p> <p>But the Democrats are advancing not only in Virginia, but in North Carolina. McCain has now been overtaken in the state, which he was to visit later today.</p> <p>The turnabout in Democratic fortunes in the once reliably Republican terrain comes after a marathon organising effort, and a huge investment in advertising Obama and his vice-president, Joe Biden, have visited eight times between them, with Bill Clinton making two appearances yesterday.</p> <p>On local television, Obama campaign ads pop up in every programming break, outlining his economic plan, offering tax cuts and outnumbering McCain advertisements by about five to one.</p> <p>The McCain campaign's single television ad focuses on Obama's association<br>with Ayers. The Republican National Committee today released yet another video on the Ayers connection intended not for broadcast but viral emails.</p> <p>That appears to be having some traction.</p> <p>\"I'm scared of Obama - from what I have read, and his associations which are questionable, his so-called terrorist associations, and even his church,\" said Lori Raynor, an environmental biochemist. \"I just don't think he can run this country.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Some of my friends have even told me they think he is the anti-Christ.\"</p> <p>Others in the crowd remained convinced that Obama was a Muslim - even<br>while criticising his choice of church for the last 20 years. \"I believe he has had a Muslim upbringing, but his wife is a Christian,\" said Scott Wallace, a physician's assistant.</p>",
  "<p>We meet at a moment of great uncertainty for America. The economic crisis we face is the worst since the Great Depression. Markets across the globe have become increasingly unstable, and millions of Americans will open up their 401(k) statements this week and see that so much of their hard-earned savings have disappeared. </p> <p>The credit crisis has left businesses large and small unable to get loans, which means they can't buy new equipment, or hire new workers, or even make payroll for the workers they have. You've got auto plants right here in Ohio that have been around for decades closing their doors and laying off workers who've never known another job in their entire life. </p> <p>760,000 workers have lost their jobs this year. Unemployment here in Ohio is up 85% over the last eight years, which is the highest it's been in sixteen years. You've lost one of every four manufacturing jobs, the typical Ohio family has seen their income fall $2,500, and it's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage, or fill up your gas tank, or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month. At this rate, the question isn't just \"are you better off than you were four years ago?\", it's \"are you better off than you were four weeks ago?\" </p> <p>I know these are difficult times. I know folks are worried. But I also know this \u2013 we can steer ourselves out of this crisis. Because we are the United States of America. We are the country that has faced down war and depression, great challenges and great threats. And at each and every moment, we have risen to meet these challenges \u2013 not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as Americans. </p> <p> We still have the most talented, most productive workers of any country on Earth. We're still home to innovation and technology, colleges and universities that are the envy of the world. Some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and our research facilities. It won't be easy, but there's no reason we can't make this century another American century. </p> <p>But it will take a new direction. It will take new leadership in Washington. It will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last eight years. And that's why I'm running for president of the United States of America. </p> <p>My opponent has made his choice. Last week, Senator McCain's campaign announced that they were going to \"turn the page\" on the discussion about our economy so they can spend the final weeks of this election attacking me instead. His campaign actually said, and I quote, \"if we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose\". Well Senator McCain may be worried about losing an election, but I'm worried about Americans who are losing their jobs, and their homes, and their life savings. They can't afford four more years of the economic theory that says we should give more and more to millionaires and billionaires and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. We've seen where that's led us and we're not going back. It's time to turn the page.</p> <p> Over the course of this campaign, I've laid out a set of policies that will grow our middle-class and strengthen our economy in the long-term. I'll reform our tax code so that 95% of workers and their families get a tax cut, and eliminate income taxes for seniors making under $50,000. I'll bring down the cost of health care for families and businesses by investing in preventative care, new technology, and giving every American the chance to get the same kind of health insurance that members of Congress give themselves. We'll ensure every child can compete in the global economy by recruiting an army of new teachers and making college affordable for anyone who wants to go. We'll create five million new, high-wage jobs by investing in the renewable sources of energy that will eliminate the oil we currently import from the Middle East in ten years, and we'll create two million jobs by rebuilding our crumbling roads, schools and bridges. </p> <p>But that's a long-term strategy for growth. Right now, we face an immediate economic emergency that requires urgent action. We can't wait to help workers and families and communities who are struggling right now \u2013 who don't know if their job or their retirement will be there tomorrow, who don't know if next week's paycheck will cover this month's bills. We need to pass an economic rescue plan for the middle-class and we need to do it now. Today I'm proposing a number of steps that we should take immediately to stabilise our financial system, provide relief to families and communities, and help struggling homeowners. It's a plan that begins with one word that's on everyone's mind, and it's spelled J-O-B-S. </p> <p>We've already lost three-quarters of a million jobs this year, and some experts say that unemployment may rise to 8% by the end of next year. We can't wait until then to start creating new jobs. That's why I'm proposing to give our businesses a new American jobs tax credit for each new employee they hire here in the United States over the next two years. </p> <p>To fuel the real engine of job creation in this country, I've also proposed eliminating all capital gains taxes on investments in small businesses and start-up companies, and I've proposed an additional tax incentive through next year to encourage new small business investment. It is time to protect the jobs we have and to create the jobs of tomorrow by unlocking the drive, and ingenuity, and innovation of the American people. And we should fast track the loan guarantees we passed for our auto industry and provide more as needed so that they can build the energy-efficient cars America needs to end our dependence on foreign oil. </p> <p>We will also save one million jobs by creating a jobs and growth fund that will provide money to states and local communities so that they can move forward with projects to rebuild and repair our roads, our bridges and our schools. A lot of these projects and these jobs are at risk right now because of budget shortfalls, but this fund will make sure they continue. </p> <p>The second part of my rescue plan is to provide immediate relief to families who are watching their paycheck shrink and their jobs and life savings disappear. I've already proposed a middle-class tax cut for 95% of workers and their families, but today I'm calling on Congress to pass a plan so that the IRS will mail out the first round of those tax cuts as soon as possible. We should also extend and expand unemployment benefits to those Americans who have lost their jobs and are having a harder time finding new ones in this weak economy. And we should stop making them pay taxes on those unemployment insurance benefits as well. </p> <p>At a time when the ups and downs of the stock market have rarely been so unpredictable and dramatic, we also need to give families and retirees more flexibility and security when it comes to their retirement savings. </p> <p>I welcome Senator McCain's proposal to waive the rules that currently force our seniors to withdraw from their 401(k)s even when the market is bad. I think that's a good idea, but I think we need to do even more. Since so many Americans will be struggling to pay the bills over the next year, I propose that we allow every family to withdraw up to 15% from their IRA or 401(k) \u2013 up to a maximum of $10,000 \u2013 without any fine or penalty throughout 2009. This will help families get through this crisis without being forced to make painful choices like selling their homes or not sending their kids to college.</p> <p>The third part of my rescue plan is to provide relief for homeowners who are watching their home values decline while their property taxes go up. Earlier this year I pushed for legislation that would help homeowners stay in their homes by working to modify their mortgages. When Secretary Paulson proposed his original financial rescue plan it included nothing for homeowners. When Senator McCain was silent on the issue, I insisted that it include protections for homeowners. Now the Treasury must use the authority its been granted and move aggressively to help people avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes. We don't need a new law or a new $300bn giveaway to banks like Senator McCain has proposed, we just need to act quickly and decisively.</p> <p>I've already proposed a mortgage tax credit for struggling homeowners worth 10% of the interest you pay on your mortgage and we should move quickly to pass it. We should also change the unfair bankruptcy laws that allow judges to write down your mortgage if you own six or seven homes, but not if you have only one. And for all those cities and small towns that are facing a choice between cutting services like healthcare and education or raising property taxes, we will provide the funding to prevent those tax hikes from happening. We cannot allow homeowners and small towns to suffer because of the mess made by Wall Street and Washington. </p> <p>For those Americans in danger of losing their homes, today I'm also proposing a three-month moratorium on foreclosures. If you are a bank or lender that is getting money from the rescue plan that passed Congress, and your customers are making a good-faith effort to make their mortgage payments and renegotiate their mortgages, you will not be able to foreclose on their home for three months. We need to give people the breathing room they need to get back on their feet. </p> <p>Finally, this crisis has taught us that we cannot have a sound economy with a dysfunctional financial system. We passed a financial rescue plan that has the promise to help stabilise the financial system, but only if we act quickly, effectively and aggressively. The Treasury Department must move quickly with their plan to put more money into struggling banks so they have enough to lend, and they should do it in a way that protects taxpayers instead of enriching CEOs. There was a report yesterday that some financial institutions participating in this rescue plan are still trying to avoid restraints on CEO pay. That's not just wrong, it's an outrage to every American whose tax dollars have been put at risk. No major investor would ever make an investment if they didn't think the corporation was being prudent and responsible, and we shouldn't expect taxpayers to think any differently. We should also be prepared to extend broader guarantees if it becomes necessary to stabilise our financial system.</p> <p> I also believe that [the] Treasury should not limit itself to purchasing mortgage-backed securities \u2013 it should help unfreeze markets for individual mortgages, student loans, car loans, and credit card loans. And I think we need to do even more to make loans available in two very important areas of our economy: small businesses and communities. </p> <p>On Friday, I proposed [a] small business rescue plan that would create an emergency lending fund to lend money directly to small businesses that need cash for their payroll or to buy inventory. It's what we did after 9/11, and it allowed us to get low-cost loans out to tens of thousands of small businesses. We'll also make it easier for private lenders to make small business loans by expanding the Small Business Administration's loan guarantee program. By temporarily eliminating fees for borrowers and lenders, we can unlock the credit that small firms need to pay their workers and keep their doors open. And today, I'm also proposing that we maintain the ability of states and local communities that are struggling to maintain basic services without raising taxes to continue to get the credit they need. </p> <p>Congress should pass this emergency rescue plan as soon as possible. If Washington can move quickly to pass a rescue plan for our financial system, there's no reason we can't move just as quickly to pass a rescue plan for our middle-class that will create jobs, provide relief, and help homeowners. And if Congress does not act in the coming months, it will be one of the first things I do as president of the United States. Because we can't wait any longer to start creating new jobs, to help struggling communities and homeowners, and to provide real and immediate relief to families who are worried not only about this month's bills, but their entire life savings. This plan will help ease those anxieties, and along with the other economic policies I've proposed, it will begin to create new jobs, grow family incomes, and put us back on the path to prosperity. </p> <p>I won't pretend this will be easy or come without cost. We'll have to set priorities as never before, and stick to them. That means pursuing investments in areas such as energy, education and health care that bear directly on our economic future, while deferring other things we can afford to do without. It means scouring the federal budget, line-by-line, ending programs that we don't need and making the ones we do work more efficiently and cost less. </p> <p>It also means promoting a new ethic of responsibility. Part of the reason this crisis occurred is that everyone was living beyond their means \u2013 from Wall Street to Washington to even some on Main Street. CEOs got greedy. Politicians spent money they didn't have. Lenders tricked people into buying home they couldn't afford and some folks knew they couldn't afford them and bought them anyway. <br>We've lived through an era of easy money, in which we were allowed and even encouraged to spend without limits, to borrow instead of save.</p> <p>Now, I know that in an age of declining wages and skyrocketing costs, for many folks this was not a choice but a necessity. People have been forced to turn to credit cards and home equity loans to keep up, just like our government has borrowed from China and other creditors to help pay its bills.</p> <p>But we now know how dangerous that can be. Once we get past the present emergency, which requires immediate new investments, we have to break that cycle of debt. Our long-term future requires that we do what's necessary to scale down our deficits, grow wages and encourage personal savings again.</p> <p>It's a serious challenge. But we can do it if we act now, and if we act as one nation. We can bring a new era of responsibility and accountability to Wall Street and to Washington. We can put in place common-sense regulations to prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again. We can make investments in the technology and innovation that will restore prosperity and lead to new jobs and a new economy for the 21st century. We can restore a sense of fairness and balance that will give ever American a fair shot at the American dream. And above all, we can restore confidence \u2013 confidence in America, confidence in our economy, and confidence in ourselves. </p> <p>This country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we haven't seen in nearly a century. And future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test. Will they say that this was a time when America lost its way and its purpose? When we allowed our own petty differences and broken politics to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession? </p> <p>Or will they say that this was another one of those moments when America overcame? When we battled back from adversity by recognising that common stake that we have in each other's success? </p> <p>This is one of those moments. I realise you're cynical and fed up with politics. I understand that you're disappointed and even angry with your leaders. You have every right to be. But despite all of this, I ask of you what's been asked of the American people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history. I ask you to believe \u2013 to believe in yourselves, in each other, and in the future we can build together. </p> <p>Together, we cannot fail. Not now. Not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save. Not when there are so many Americans without jobs and without homes. Not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor, or send their child to college, or pay their bills at the end of the month. Not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves. </p> <p>We can do this. Americans have done this before. Some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe I can't go to college but my child can, maybe I can't have my own business but my child can. I may have to rent, but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own. I may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for Senate. I might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the United States of America. </p> <p>Now it falls to us. Together, we cannot fail. Together, we can overcome the broken policies and divided politics of the last eight years. Together, we can renew an economy that rewards work and rebuilds the middle class. Together, we can create millions of new jobs, and deliver on the promise of healthcare you can afford and education that helps your kids compete. We can do this if we come together, if we have confidence in ourselves and each other, if we look beyond the darkness of the day to the bright light of hope that lies ahead. Together, we can change this country and change this world. Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless America.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama sought to build on his commanding poll lead over John McCain today by setting out a $60bn rescue plan aimed at creating more jobs and easing the burden on US households suffering from the economic shakeout.</p> <p>In an echo of the 1930s New Deal, Obama proposed embarking on programmes to repair bridges, roads, schools and other infrastructure projects that have been on hold for decades. </p> <p>To provide immediate relief for struggling families, he suggested allowing people to dip into their retirement plans and imposing a three-month moratorium on mortgage foreclosures.</p> <p>Obama said his plan should be implemented immediately and would not have to wait until a new president takes over on January 20. </p> <p>The Democratic candidate was seeking to take control of the issue that could decide the election. Neither he nor McCain have yet put forward ideas for dealing with the financial crisis that have resonated with the electorate. Republican and Democratic analysts say that the first of the two to do so will hold the key to November 4 election. </p> <p>Obama announced his plan, worked out over the last few weeks with a battery of former treasury staff and other economic advisers, in a speech in Toledo, Ohio.</p> <p>With only three weeks left to the election, support for Obama appears to be hardening as the public blames the Republicans for the crisis. A Washington Post/ABC poll today put Obama on 53% to McCain's 43%. In a survey of scores of Republican strategists conducted by the National Journal over the weekend, 80% said they expected Obama to win, compared with only 17% three weeks ago.</p> <p>Although the polls could narrow closer to the election, especially if the stock markets rebound, McCain's campaign continues to show signs of uncertainty. In contrast with Obama's announcement of specific economic policies, McCain abandoned a plan, promised by one of his advisers, senator Lindsey Graham yesterday, to unveil proposals of his own.</p> <p>Obama, in what his campaign team billed as a major economic speech, put the emphasis on creating new jobs after the loss of 750,000 jobs this year and predictions of 8% unemployment by the end of the year. \"It's a plan that begins with one word that's on everyone's mind, and it's spelled J-O-B-S,\" he said.</p> <p>To help create jobs, he is proposed a $3,000 job tax credit for every new employee a firm takes on over the next two years. He said 1m new jobs can be saved by creating a jobs and growth fund that will provide money to states and local communities to rebuild and repair roads, bridges, schools and other infrastructure projects. </p> <p>He is suggesting that federal lending should be provided to help states and municipal governments embark such projects. </p> <p>In a rare acknowledgment of a good idea from the opposing camp, Obama, appealing to independents who tend to dislike partisan politics, welcomed McCain's plan for changing pension regulations so that people are not penalised by low stock market prices. \"I think that's a good idea, but I think we need to do even more,\" Obama said.</p> <p>The Democratic candidate's plan to allow people to raid their pension plans would allow families to \"get through this crisis without being forced to make painful choices like selling their homes or not sending their kids to college\".</p> <p>Opening his speech, he described the crisis as the worst since the Great Depression. \"You've got auto plants right here in Ohio that have been around for decades closing their doors and laying off workers who've never known another job in their entire life,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>A little earlier today, John McCain gave a <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/10/13/in_virginia_mccain_vows_an_und.html\">fiery but essentially policy-free speech</a> in Virginia, seeking to portray himself as the tough-as-nails underdog who's going to surprise his complacent -- and big-spending -- rival by surging to victory from behind. (He drew heavily on a theme that Hillary Clinton perfected towards the end of the primary season -- the implication that if you're behind in the polls, that means your supporters are somehow being slighted and ignored.) The Obama campaign <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/obama-camps-response-to-speech/\">issued a derisive statement</a> in response, noting that until yesterday McCain had been promising a set of new proposals on the economy. Shortly, in Toledo, Ohio, the Hopester is due to deliver what's been described as a \"major\" speech on the economy. I'll be liveblogging it here at <strong>1.30pm eastern, 6.30pm UK time</strong>. </p> <p><strong>1.34pm</strong>: Here he is, at the Toledo convention centre, making various preliminary remarks. Obama wants to talk about \"uncertainty in America\", but the audience keeps interrupting by telling him they love him. </p> <p>Times are tough, he begins. Factories are closing. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/401K\">401ks</a> \"have become 101ks\". Unemployment in Ohio, for example, is the highest it's been in 16 years. \"It's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage or even keep the electricity on until the end of the month.\" The question isn't just whether you're better off than four years ago: it's whether you're better off than you were four weeks ago.</p> <p><strong>1.38pm</strong>: However, everything will be all right in the end because THIS IS AMERICA. But \"it will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last eight years.\" </p> <p>\"My opponent has made his choice...\" Boos from the crowd. \"No, we don't need that,\" Obama tells them. \"We just need to vote.\" (Does the Obama campaign's condemnation of McCain's negativity mean he has to try to eliminate <em>any</em> negativity from his own crowds' reactions?) He's reminding everyone of the McCain advisor who told the Washington Post that the Republicans would lose the election if they didn't shift the focus from the economy. \"Sen McCain may be worried about losing an election, but I'm worried about you losing your homes, your jobs, your life savings.\"</p> <p>And now a run through various long-held policies on tax and healthcare; nothing new so far.</p> <p><strong>1.42pm</strong>: \"If we can afford to spend $10bn a month rebuilding Iraq, we can spend some rebuilding Ohio.\" But right now we face an emergency, requiring \"urgent action.\" \"Some of you know I went canvassing just yesterday... on this single block there were already two or three foreclosed homes.\" An economic rescue plan for the middle class, right now, is what's needed. </p> <p>\"Today I'm proposing a number of steps that we should take immediately to stabilize our financial system, provide relief to families and communities, and help struggling homeowners. It's a plan that begins with one word that's on everyone's mind, and it's easy to spell: J, O, B, S. Jobs.\" iPods for everyone, then!</p> <p><strong>1.46pm</strong>: \"A new American jobs tax credit\" for businesses for each American employee they hire over the next two years. And a Jobs and Growth Fund to \"save one million jobs\" by providing \"money to states and local communities so that they can move forward with projects to rebuild and repair our roads, our bridges and our schools. A lot of these projects and these jobs are at risk right now because of budget shortfalls, but this fund will make sure they continue.\"</p> <p><strong>1.50pm</strong>: And now the second leg of the plan, focused on savings, benefits and tax: he says he's already proposed a tax cut or 95% of people, but calls on congress to make the IRS mail out the first tranche of the tax cuts right away. \"I want to give credit where credit's due -- I welcome Senator McCain's proposal to waive the rules that currently force our seniors to withdraw from their 401ks even when the market's bad... That's a good idea, but we need to do even more. Since so many Americans will be struggling to pay the bills over the next year, I propose that we allow every family to withdraw up to 15% from their IRA or 401(k) up to a maximum of $10,000 without any fine throughout 2009, just to tide them over.\"</p> <p><strong>1.52pm</strong>: Third leg of the plan: relief for homeowners. \"Earlier this year I pushed for legislation that would help homeowners stay in their homes\" and help people avoid foreclosure. We don't need a new law, or McCain's mortgage buyout plan -- a \"giveaway to banks\". We just need action and to modify mortgage terms, he says.</p> <p>Now he proposes a three-month moratorium on home foreclosures. \"We need to give people the breathing room to get back on their feet!\" The audience liked that, a lot.</p> <p><strong>1.55pm</strong>: After a requisite bit of anti-Wall Streetery, Obama is onto a densely detailed elucidation of his \"small business rescue plan\"; there's really no comparison, detail-wise, between this speech and the McCain troops-rousing we heard earlier. \"We'll make it easier for private lenders to make small business loans by expanding the Small Business Administration's loan guarantee program.By temporarily eliminating fees for borrowers and lenders, we can unlock the credit that small firms need to pay their workers and keep their doors open...\" Also, he wants to \"maintain the ability of states and local communities... to continue to get the credit they need\" to maintain basic services.</p> <p><strong>1.57pm</strong>: Let's be honest, he says: we've all been living above our means -- Wall Street, Washington, and \"some people on Main Street.\" We \"lived through an era of easy money\" -- endless loans, credit cards, etcetera. Which might have been a \"choice not a necessity\" for many, but still -- \"we know now how dangerous that can be.\" And so after the \"present emergency,\" we \"have to break that cycle of debt\", and learn to live within our means. Pretty stern stuff, almost scolding, though this audience is happy to hear it.</p> <p><strong>1.59pm</strong>: Future generations will judge America on how it responds to this crisis. Ah, the rhetorical crescendo finale begins... </p> <p>\"We can do this. We've done it before. Everybody here's got a story [of] a grandparent who said, maybe I've got to work in a dirty tough job, but my grandchild, maybe he'll be able to afford to buy his own business... maybe my child can be a congresswoman, maybe my child can be a mayor, maybe, just maybe, my child can run for the United States of America... you and I together, we're going to change the country and change the world.\" And thus he concludes. </p> <p>Everything is terrible, but everything is going to be all right.</p>",
  "<p>Nothing surprises me any more. Robert Mugabe the eloquent democrat has become a murdering monster, and will do everything he can to cling to power until the very end. Sadly, the monster retains all the intellectual faculties and abilities of the democrat. </p> <p>He <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/12/zimbabwe1\">cunningly orchestrated the power-sharing deal</a> after losing the March elections and being forced by the MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai to make a sham of the June run-off. This had lost him credibility even among some African rulers. </p> <p>By engineering the deal, Mugabe forced Tsvangirai to acknowledge him as president in return for the premiership and a few cabinet seats. This regained him the right to swan around the world as the legitimate president of Zimbabwe. Ergo, he does not need Tsvangirai any more. </p> <p>But he does not want to be the one to kill the deal \u2013 as this would lose him credibility once more. So he skilfully manoeuvres things so that the MDC will be forced to walk away from the table \u2013 leaving Mugabe where he fully intended to be all along \u2013 in the driving seat. </p> <p>Despite the country collapsing around him and millions suffering from hunger and disease, there is method in Mugabe's madness. He is positioning himself for the next election \u2013 determined to reverse his humiliation at the hands of the electorate on March 29. He will never forgive Zimbabweans for rejecting him. </p> <p>This is why he has insisted on retaining control of the power ministries, while giving MDC the service ministries. He needs the police and the army, home affairs and defence ministries, to seal off the rural areas, disrupt the MDC's activities and thrash and threaten its supporters. In addition, home affairs is responsible for the conduct of elections. He needs local government to retain control of the chiefs and keep them on side. He needs information to maintain his stranglehold on the media, keeping people in the dark \u2013 as is the wont of every dictator. Access to information for millions through the publication of the mass-circulation independent weekly, <a href=\"http://www.thezimbabwean.co.uk/\">the Zimbabwean</a>, is what cost him the March election \u2013 according to his election agent, Emmerson Mnangagwa. </p> <p>And he needs foreign affairs to continue his world-wide campaign of hate-speech and disinformation against the west, and to continue to wag his tail for the Russians and the Chinese.</p> <p>His henchmen, the military chiefs, have a particularly vested interest in keeping control over the police \u2013 most, if not all, of them could and certainly would be arrested by an MDC-controlled police force on a wide range of charges, from crimes against humanity to theft and corruption. </p> <p>Mugabe wants the MDC, now united as Arthur Mutambara has been forced by his party to abandon his flirtation with Zanu-PF, to walk away from the deal. That's why he doesn't want Thabo Mbeki, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/22/southafrica\">lame-duck turned dead-duck</a> president/mediator, to come and fix it.</p>",

The MDC said it doubted mediation efforts by Mbeki this week would get Zanu-PF to compromise. </p> <p>Speaking at a rally of MDC supporters in Harare, Tsvangirai declared he was not prepared \"to compromise for the sake of compromise\".</p> <p>Threatening to withdraw from the agreement, he said: \"This struggle is about change. If we are not given the instruments of affecting change in your life, then this arrangement is stillborn.\"</p> <p>Tsvangirai told the rally he would not be pressured by Mugabe into joining an administration dominated by Zanu-PF after the opposition Movement for Democratic Change won the last reputable elections in March.</p> <p>\"If they do it that way, we have no right to be part of such an arrangement,\" he said. \"The people have suffered. But if it means suffering the more in order for them to get what is at stake, then so be it.\"</p> <p>Under the deal, Mugabe retains the presidency and chairs the cabinet while Tsvangirai, as prime minister, will head a council of ministers supervising the cabinet.</p> <p>Mugabe gazetted the appointment of new cabinet posts at the weekend, allocating his party control over the various security and intelligence forces as well as the justice portfolio and the information ministry, which controls Zimbabwe's highly partisan state newspapers and broadcasters.</p> <p>The MDC described the move as a \"giant act of madness which puts the whole deal into jeopardy\", and as a ploy to pre-empt Mbeki's visit.</p> <p>\"The elite in Zanu-PF is not interested in addressing the current challenges in the country. Instead, they are obsessed with power retention at all costs,\" it said.</p> <p>The MDC said it would agree to Zanu-PF having authority over the military, but that Tsvangirai must control home affairs, which oversees the police, and the justice ministry. That is important to Tsvangirai to ensure that Zanu-PF does not repeat its violent campaign at the next election.</p> <p>Mugabe's move is a demonstration of his power to obstruct the political deal he described as \"humiliating\" after he was forced to sign it last month. But his position remains weak. There will be no foreign aid to rescue an economy collapsing under hyperinflation - officially put at 231 million per cent, but which in reality runs into the trillions - without Tsvangirai wielding real authority at the head of a genuine power-sharing government.</p> <p>Mugabe only signed the political agreement with the opposition because his administration had no solutions to the economic crisis. While he can block implementation of the deal and keep control of the government, he will be left facing even deeper problems than when he was forced into the agreement.</p> <p>Neither can Mugabe count on Mbeki to protect him. Although Mbeki remains the mediator, South Africa's new president, Kgalema Motlanthe, and those around him are hostile to Mugabe and there is a growing will inside the new government to confront the Zimbabwean leader.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu\">European Union</a> condemned Mugabe's latest unilateral move. Britain's foreign secretary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidmiliband\">David Miliband</a>, said Europeans would \"play no part in supporting a power grab by the Mugabe regime\".</p> <p>\"It is important that there is an international united response that says that the results of the elections need to be respected and a power grab will not be respected,\" Miliband told reporters at EU talks in Luxembourg.</p> <p>The EU has threatened to step up sanctions on Zimbabwe unless Mugabe sticks to the terms of the accord. </p> <p>\"If the agreement is not applied we shall resume our sanctions and reinforce them,\" said the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/france\">France</a> currently holds the presidency of the EU. </p> <p>Existing EU sanctions include visa bans and asset freezes on top Zimbabwean officials including Mugabe.</p>",
  "<p>Sometimes I wish I didn't have to declare the conflict of interests that stops me reviewing <a href=\"http://www.john-cale.com/\">John Cale</a>'s performances - he is a precious friend - so that I could write what I think and people would take it as objective.</p> <p>But after attending the Cale-force tribute to Nico at the Festival Hall on Saturday, Cale's impetuous originality makes it seem churlish to keep schtum. What astonishes about Cale is not just his musicianship, it is the audacity of its continuous innovation, a Pandora's box of resources that produces endless surprises, such as an occasion like this. As though it were not enough have avant-garde credentials with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUJagb7hL0E\">John Cage</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cWzxJvgWc8\">Velvet Underground</a>, this relentless man seems incapable of resting upon his many laurels. </p> <p>Which is why it is boring to keep saying \"John Cale of the Velvets\" because Cale has done so much more interesting work since the inimitable drone he brought to that ensemble. Desertshore and The End, Nico's albums of 1970 and 1974 - produced by Cale, who also plays most of the instruments - and the later Camera Obscura were extraordinary in their time. But the heresy is that on Saturday, the songs were even better. Perhaps because the people singing them love Nico more than she loved herself. And certainly because the music to which Cale set them this time round was like those mirrors the Aztecs made out of black obsidian, in which one can see oneself in the dark. </p> <p>There is this idea that musicians have to \"peak\" young (and many do, despite still churning it out). But some do not; they develop, deepen and flower. Cale has scored his arrangements of Nico's songs for string quartet, ripening them with his decades of musical experience. As master of ceremonies he gave giving Nico's music a legacy, while entrusting it to younger musicians and voices. </p> <p>This generational transition could be foretold by watching the audience arrive. It is heartening to see a boy with long hair and fingernails painted black buying his girlfriend an overpriced glass of champagne as they wait to hear a 66-year-old perform. Often, I am the only baldie lucky enough to have his teenage daughter and her friends as anxious to hear this music as I am, but on Saturday there were quite a few of us with our meticulously made-up offspring, and many aged in between. </p> <p>Cale did not just take Nico's songs, decades later, and perform them. Yes, the music delved into the opaque creativity of the girl born in the year of the Anschluss, who turned seven as Berlin fell, then proceeded from being Christa P\u00e4ffgen to being Nico the actress, model, muse and, as Saturday demonstrated, the contralto and poet. But the songs were mostly sung by young people who openly owe a creative debt to them, and to what Cale did with them. Indeed, such was the severe humility of those who rallied to Cale's call that they did not even introduce themselves: not James Dean Bradfield of Manic Street Preachers, Cale's fellow Welshman, nor Fyfe Dangerfield of the Guillemots, playing grand piano like Franz Liszt after having his laudanum spiked.<br> Four years ago, next door at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, Cale launched a UK tour with a new band which that night showed itself to be the most purposefully powerful he has ever worked with during his solo career (as per the explosive live album, Circus). The young musicians from Los Angeles remain the means by which Cale turns his adventures into sound, but on Saturday they held back a little - only just - to create what in painting would be the layers of colour that infuse everything else - light, tonality, texture. This was especially the case when Cale took the mike himself for a shattering account of Facing the Wind: \"There's nothing more to sing about,\" wrote Nico, \"Not now, or when they carry me away in the rain.\" </p> <p>Like everyone else, I wish he'd played his viola, but this was not the night for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwzaifhSw2c\">Venus in Furs</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Last week, when a poll came out showing <a href=\"http://americanresearchgroup.com/pres2008/WV08.html\">Obama with an eight-point lead in West Virginia</a> of all places, the McCain campaign hastily decided it would dispatch Palin to the state to cover the base.</p> <p>I had visions of a huge rally. So <a href=\"http://www.wvgazette.com/News/200810120410\">here's what happened</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>KENOVA, W.Va. - Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin made a pit stop in West Virginia en route to battleground Ohio, riling up some of Democrat Barack Obama's Mountain State supporters in the process. </p> <p>The Alaska governor and family members spent about 25 minutes at Tri-State Airport in Kenova after arriving Sunday. She made no remarks before her campaign motorcade headed into Ohio.</p> <p>About a dozen supporters greeted Palin as she left the aircraft holding her infant son, Trig. A small group of protesters also was on hand.</p> <p>Palin's stop in West Virginia, her first since becoming John McCain's running mate, spurred several impromptu weekend Obama rallies. One drew about 150 people Sunday outside the United Mine Workers' Charleston district office.</p> </blockquote> <p>Uh-oh, somebody messed up. A vice-presidential candidate is not supposed to come to a state and get...a dozen people, and a similar number of protestors. <em>And </em>provoke a counter-rally eight times larger for the other side.</p> <p>Maybe there's something to that poll after all. As my most faithful readers will know, that's my home state, and I'd be delighted to see it, but I still don't quite believe it. I think much hinges on the Mountaineers' fateful October 23 match-up against Auburn, although for reasons that aren't yet entirely clear to me.<br></p>",
  "<p>Nice to see that we've fully and irreversibly entered the respectful period. When asked by a television host about remarks by the Virginia GOP chairman that linked Obama to Osama bin Laden, McCain <a href=\"http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/236616.php\">said he'd have to see \"the context\" of the remarks</a>.</p> <p>You stay classy JSM.<br></p>",

All right then! \"Three weeks from now, you will choose a new President. Choose well. There is much at stake,\" says El Maverico; he seems to be making an effort to smile at the end of every sentence.</p> <p><strong>11.34am</strong>: The next president \"won't have time to get used to the office,\" he says. \"And to do that, he'll need experience, courage, judgment and a bold plan of action to take this country in a new direction. We cannot spend the next four years as we have spent much of the last eight: waiting for our luck to change. The hour is late. Our troubles are getting worse. Our enemies watch. We have to act immediately. We have to change direction now. We have to fight.\" Ah, the smell of fear...</p> <p><strong>11.37am</strong>: He's been fighting for his country since he was 17, and plans to keep fighting. He touts his mortgage-buyup plan, and promises to \"hold the line\" on taxes. A mention of Obama (in connection with the bailout) draws loud boos and repeated chants of \"Nobama! Nobama!\", which makes Sarah Palin grin broadly. \"I'm going to make government live on a budget just like you do!\" Earmarks reference coming up...?</p> <p><strong>11.40am</strong>: \"I will veto every single pork barrel bill Congresses passes.\" Thankyouverymuch.</p> <p><strong>11.41am</strong>: \"If I am elected president, I won't fine small businesses and families with children as senator Obama proposes to force them into a new huge government run health care program and keep the cost of the fine a secret until I hit you with it.\" We're into a repeating section of things McCain won't do \"as senator Obama proposes\". \"The last president to do what senator Obama wants to do... was Herbert Hoover! That didn't turn out to well! They say those who learned the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them. Well, my friends, I know my history lessons, and I sure won't make the mistakes that Senator Obama will!\"</p> <p><strong>11.42am</strong>: Obama is bad because he says nuclear power should be safe. He should try telling that to the men and women of the navy who work on nuclear-powered submarines, McCain mockingly suggests. (Wouldn't you approve of nuclear power being safe if you worked on a nuclear submarine? I'm confused.)</p> <p><strong>11.43am</strong>: Here we go: ctrl-alt-delete time. \"Let me give you the state of the race today and some straight talk.\" Please do! \"We have 22 days to go. We're six points down. The national media has written us off.\" Much booing. \"Senator Obama is measuring the drapes, and planning with speaker Pelosi and Senator Reid to raise taxes, increase spending, take away your right to vote by secret ballot in labour elections\" -- huge boos -- \"and concede defeat in Iraq, concede defeat in Iraq. My friends, I won't concede defeat -- I'll bring out troops home with victory and with honour.\" \"John McCain! John McCain!\" the crowd chant.</p> <p><strong>11.46am</strong>: \"You know what they forgot? They forgot to let you decide. My friends, we've got them just where we want them. What America needs in this hour is a fighter. Someone who puts all his cards on the table and trusts the judgment of the American people. I come from a long line of McCains who believed that to love America is to fight for her. I have fought for you most of my life. There are other ways to love this country, but I've never been the kind to do it from the sidelines...\"</p> <p><strong>11.47am</strong>: \"Will the world become safer or more dangerous? Will our military remain the strongest in the world? Will our children and grandchildren's future be brighter than ours? My answer to you is yes. Yes, we will lead. Yes, we will prosper. Yes, we will be safer. Yes, we will pass on to our children a stronger, better country.\" All this \"yes! yes! yes!\" chanting from the crowd reminds me of some other election candidate -- oh, what's his name? It's on the tip of my tongue.</p> <p><strong>11.49am</strong>: Fear is \"like a thief in the night\" and hopelessness is \"an enemy who defeats your will,\" McCain says. \"I felt those things once before; I'll never let them in again.\" And that would be psychologically healthy how exactly? \"I'm an American. And I choose to fight.\" Now we're getting fighty: \"Stand up, stand up, stand up and fight. America is worth fighting for. Nothing is inevitable here. We never give up. We never quit. We never hide from history -- we make history.\" </p> <p><strong>11.50am</strong>: \"Now, let's go win this election and get this country moving again.

Bristol Palin invited him and Johnston jumped at the chance. It was a whirlwind experience for Johnston, who was seated with the Palins at the Republican National Convention. \"At first, I was nervous,\" he said. \"Then I was like, 'Whatever.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Levi Johnston is excellent.<br></p>",

  "<p>Today's big story is The Reboot. \"Fire the campaign,\" urges Bill Kristol in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/opinion/13kristol.html?ref=opinion&amp;pagewanted=print\">his New York Times column</a> (itself probably a trial balloon floated before the politico-journalistic world to gauge reaction). Nothing they're doing is working. Kristol urges the following seven steps:</p> <p>1. Run as accessible \"happy warriors,\" providing completely media access to both candidates, just as McCain 1.0 used to do.</p> <p>2. Do local radio, talk shows, town halls, anything \u2013 and invite Obama and Biden to join them.</p> <p>3. Drop the attacks, period and end of story. They aren't working.</p> <p>4. Stop unveiling gimmicky proposals designed to win that day's spin war (you know \u2013 the kind Bill Kristol <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0908/Kristol_McCain_should_return_to_Washington_again.html\">was wild about a few weeks ago!</a>).</p> <p>5. Make \"the substantive case for his broadly centrist conservatism.\"</p> <p>6. Remind voters that the Democrats are going to be in charge of Congress, and that Democratic control of both branches will result in a return to 1970s-style unchecked taxing and spending.</p> <p>7. Offer \"a mild mea culpa\" at Wednesday's debate about the nasty turn this race has taken.</p> <p>Well, that's five short of what alcoholics are supposed to do, but I suppose Kristol doesn't think McCain is quite that far gone. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Mike Allen <a href=\"http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=F5631627-18FE-70B2-A8A4BABCC96E84C4\">reports</a> at Politico today that McCain has retooled his stump speech. The campaign provided Allen an excerpt:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The national media has written us off. Senator Obama is measuring the drapes, and planning with Speaker Pelosi and Senator Reid to raise taxes, increase spending, take away your right to vote by secret ballot in labor elections, and concede defeat in Iraq. But they forgot to let you decide. My friends, we've got them just where we want them.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Don't scoff. This isn't over. It's heading in the direction of being over, yes. But it's not over. Obama's leads are small enough in about six swing states that his victories there are by no means a lock. Those states are worth around 80 electoral votes, and a swing of 80 electoral votes could well mean a narrow McCain victory. That means that something big has to happen that changes the direction of the momentum in all six of those states, which would certainly be unusual. But it isn't impossible.</p> <p>So what do you do? You change direction and try to give yourself a fresh start. You talk about the other guy \"measuring the drapes\" already \u2013 a tried and true tactic. And you do some of the things Kristol suggests.</p> <p>I think Item 6 is potentially the most effective on Kristol's list. Lots of history suggests that Americans like divided government \u2013 they like a congressional check led by party B on a president of party A. Circumstances in which they happily give both the executive and legislative branches to one party are comparatively rare. Even during the \"Reagan revolution,\" Ronald Reagan never had a GOP Congress (Senate yes, for a time, but never the House). Bill Clinton had a Democratic Congress for two years, and then voters turned Congress Republican. </p> <p>So that line could work. As could others among Kristol's proposals. But I feel like there's still something missing here.</p> <p>Jackie Calmes of the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/us/politics/13plan.html?ref=todayspaper\">reported it first</a> \u2013 that, after a tense meeting between the candidate and top aides yesterday at which they were supposed to agree on some new economic proposals he would roll out this week, they emerged empty-handed. Calmes reports that the principals couldn't reach consensus on anything:</p> <blockquote> <p>The signs of internal confusion came as the campaign was under pressure from state party leaders to sharpen his message on the economy and at least blunt the advantage that Democrats traditionally have on the issue in hard times\u2026</p> <p>\u2026 Mr. McCain's policy adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said, \"I have no comment on anything, to anybody.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That doesn't sound like a happy fellow.</p> <p>So here, once again, we have what seems to me the same situation that has plagued his campaign since the summer. Appearance before substance. It's fine to retool speeches and promise that you're still in the fight. It's fine to open the curtain between the press section of the plane and the candidate's berth. It's fine to do all these things. And they may help. </p> <p>But if one were forced to name one reason why McCain is losing, it's that he's responded poorly, from a substantive point of view, to the current economic crisis. He put appearance before substance then, too. As I've written many times, and I'll say it again because it just gets truer and truer with every passing week: McCain built a campaign that was designed to win the wars of the daily news cycles, not the long-term battle. </p> <p>So Kristol's suggestions are fine, really. But notice that only one, Item 5, is fully about substance. </p> <p>The media will help push the reboot story line. It's superficial but it's a fact of life \u2013 the reporters want a race, and they'll gobble up a story line about \"McCain's new momentum\" if they think it'll help get their stories on page one. So McCain will benefit from that. The gap will close a little. But if McCain doesn't have stronger and more compelling things to say about the economy, the cosmetics can't save him.<br></p>",

The results of last month's parliamentary elections gave women 45 out of the 80 seats in the chamber of deputies, or <a href=\"http://www.unifem.org/news_events/story_detail.php?StoryID=736\">56%</a>. This surpasses Rwandan women's near parity in the outgoing parliament, already the highest proportion in the world. Rwandan President Paul Kagame praised the election results, saying that a <a href=\" http://www.nation.co.ke/News/africa/-/1066/477882/-/148sb2oz/-/\">female majority in parliament</a> \"emphasises the fact that the country's future is being shaped by women\".</p> <p>Only 14 years after the 1994 genocide, Rwanda has risen from the ashes to become a gender-equality trailblazer. Women enjoy many rights previously denied to them, including the right to own land, to open a bank account and to start a business. The government see women as critical partners to alleviate rural poverty and diversify the economy, moving from dependence on agriculture to a more knowledge-based one. To promote the role of women in politics, the constitution reserves 30% of the seats in parliament for women. The ruling party (Rwandan Patriotic Front, RPF) placed many women at the top of its <a href=\"http://www.un.org/Pubs/chronicle/2003/issue4/0403p25.asp\">lists of candidates</a>. It has also appointed numerous women to senior government posts. By March of this year, women held eight of 20 cabinet seats, including the foreign affairs portfolio. </p> <p>However, a sombre second look at the politics of Rwanda's gender revolution reveals a less optimistic interpretation of the election results. First, the vote may have been quite free (on election day), but the elections were hardly fair. Only the ruling party, its coalition partners and two other pro-RPF parties ran in the elections. No one actually ran against the government. The government had previously banned credible opposition parties and jailed, exiled or even killed many of their leaders. The buried story of the elections is how undemocratic they actually were. </p> <p>Second, even as women's visibility in politics is at an all-time high, their ability to shape the future of the country, ironically, has not improved. Rwanda's parliament has limited influence. Power is heavily concentrated in the hands of President Kagame and his close advisors. Parliamentarians \u2013 be they male or female \u2013 actually have very little power to legislate on behalf of their constituents. They have little room to develop policy or even to debate openly; space for free and open political expression is limited. </p> <p>Third, female political representation and more progressive laws have not translated into a significant improvement in the lives of the poor. Some 90% of Rwandan women are peasants who rely on subsistence agriculture. Few have benefited from the country's progressive gender policies or relatively high rates of economic growth. The gap between the living standards of some wealthy urbanites and most rural dwellers is actually increasing. Post-genocide policies favour the urban elite, many of whom are Tutsi who returned to live in Rwanda after the genocide. The vast majority of Rwandan women (and men) who survived the genocide remain extremely poor, politically marginal and, in many cases, traumatised by what they lived through. Increasing levels of authoritarianism actually stifle any attempts to address growing inequalities. </p> <p>This leads to a final point: female parliamentarians and cabinet ministers do not function independently of party politics. They do not, by virtue of their sex, automatically prioritise gender equality over the ruling party's political agenda. Rwanda's post-genocide government understandably seeks to maintain peace and security. It does so in part through a policy of national unity and reconciliation. It has banned references to ethnicity from public discourse: Rwanda is a land of all Rwandans and there no longer are any Hutu, Tutsi or Twa. Though these are arguably laudable objectives, the government uses this policy as a tool to suppress dissent and silence criticism. The RPF expects parliamentarians and other public figures to toe the party line. Those who do not are accused of \"ethnic divisionism\" or promoting \"an ideology of genocide\" and relegated to the sidelines or worse, jailed or \"disappeared\". Even aid donors are loth to criticise the government, which does not hesitate to play the genocide guilt card against them.</p> <p>The Rwandan government, representatives of the United Nations, western donors and feminist organisations celebrate Rwanda's milestone in women's parliamentary representation, claiming it is the result of enlightened attitudes and great vision. Such accounts gloss over these women's very limited role in policymaking, the continued marginalisation of the vast majority of Rwandan women, and the government's superficial commitment to democratic governance. In many ways, Rwanda's \"gender revolution\" serves as a smokescreen to distract critics from other pressing issues facing Rwandans. We should not confuse the largely symbolic achievements of gender equality with concrete progress in most women's lives, nor allow a gender lens to obscure recognition of the growing social and political inequalities in Rwanda under an often authoritarian and repressive government. The international community uncritically supported Rwanda's ethnic chauvinist government throughout the 1980s and early 1990s \u2013 with tragic results. It should not allow seemingly progressive gender policies to make it complicit in Rwanda's new politics of exclusion.</p> <p><em>Erin Baines is an assistant professor at the Liu Institute for Global Issues, University of British Columbia.

  "<p>We're at the point where we're obsessed with the visible manifestations of the campaign right now \u2013 the stump speeches, the ads, whether the Bill Ayers attacks are working. But let's step back and consider something that isn't immediately visible, something that might have a big impact on how this race winds down. In a word, money.</p> <p>Two questions you may not have thought about in the past week: How much money is Obama probably raising right now, and how much are the Republicans raising?</p> <p>Obama will announce his September totals next week. He raised a record <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/14/obama-raises-66-million-i_n_126259.html\">$66m in August</a>. Doesn't it seem safe to say that the September number will be north of that? Maybe $75m? And what about the October figure? He could hit $100m in a single month. Even if that proves high, the guesstimate of another $75m or so, a more conservative projection today, would have seemed mind-blowing a few months ago.</p> <p>You could tell last week that Obama was swimming in cash when his campaign announced that it had <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/09/barack-obama-buys-half-ho_n_133363.html\">purchased 30-minute blocs of air time during prime time</a> on three different networks. Every indication is that he could practically buy the whole week on a network if he wanted to, but the big shows are starting their new seasons. As much enthusiasm as he's generated, he's still probably no match for Grey's Anatomy.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the GOP side\u2026McCain, remember, accepted public financing for the general election, which Obama did not, so McCain gets his money from the federal government. He and his party can, however, raise money that goes technically not to him but to the party. It can't be spent on campaign travel and payroll, but it can be spent on television advertising, mailings and other activities that support the presidential ticket.</p> <p>I should think they had a strong September \u2013 remember, McCain was ahead for the first half of September, until the financial crisis hit. But how must they be doing now? In all likelihood, not nearly as well.</p> <p>McCain's campaign is now at the point \u2013 seven, eight points behind with just three weeks remaining; also, unsure of its message and direction \u2013 where the political pros in the party start making choices. They look at the amount of money the party is bringing in. They look at the state of McCain's campaign and start making sober calculations about the chance of his winning. </p> <p>Then, they size up the races for Senate and the House of Representatives. They start telling themselves things like, \"Well, okay, maybe we lose the presidency. But we've got to keep the Democrats from getting 60 senators. We've got to try to hold on in <a href=\"http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2008/Senate/Maps/Oct12-s.html\">North Carolina, Minnesota and Oregon</a>.\" And as far as the House of Representatives goes, <a href=\"http://www.electionprojection.com/house08.shtml\">momentum is still moving in the Democrats' direction</a>. They may pick up 12 seats, which would give them a hefty 61-seat advantage. </p> <p>Republican operatives want desperately to recapture control of that body. And they know very well that every 10 or so seats you're behind there adds another two or four years to the project. So they have a very strong interest in trying to keep losses there to a minimum.</p> <p>So, with fewer resources at their disposal than the Obama campaign, the Republicans are going to have to start making choices. My hunch is that McCain has a week to show that he can break through in <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/maps/obama_vs_mccain/#data\">Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina and Florida (65 electoral votes all told)</a>. He's slightly behind in Ohio, North Carolina and Florida, and somewhat more than slightly behind in Virginia. </p> <p>If McCain can show by next weekend that he's nudged the needle in these states in his direction, his campaign managers will probably be able to persuade the party's money people to keep the infusions coming. </p> <p>But if he can't, history shows that they'll start cutting their losses and moving their spending to the protection of congressional incumbents. As you read blind quotes from GOP operatives over the next few days, keep an eye out for hints of this.<br></p>",
  "<p>It was the weekend that the increasingly negative tone of the election race finally caught up with John McCain. After days of growing unease about the hatred his campaign might be whipping up with its personal attacks on Barack Obama, the Republican was forced to confront his own supporters: on Friday, he seized the microphone from one woman who said she feared Obama because \"he's an Arab\", and told the crowd that his rival was \"a decent person that you do not have to be scared of as president of the United States\". The most scathing criticism of the McCain campaign came from John Lewis, a Democratic congressman and civil rights icon from Georgia, who said the climate reminded him of the incendiary speeches of Alabama governor George Wallace and the 1963 Birmingham church bombing, Ed Pilkington writes in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/13/uselections2008-johnmccain\">today's Guardian</a>. \"Because of [the] atmosphere of hate,\" Lewis said, \"four little girls were killed on a Sunday morning when a church was bombed in Birmingham, Alabama.\" McCain called it a \"brazen and baseless attack\", but seemed to be toning down his rhetoric.</p> <p>The question was whether he could find a strategy to replace it with. There were signs of rising panic among senior Republicans, several of whom told the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/us/politics/12strategy.html\">New York Times</a> they felt McCain was not connecting with voters. Within the campaign, the Associated Press reported, \"from junior aides to top advisers, the frustration is palpable\". But on one topic at least, the McCain campaign seemed determined to put a cheerful face on things. Late on Friday, an investigation into the so-called \"troopergate\" scandal had determined that Sarah Palin violated a state ethics law when she pressured Alaska's chief of police to sack her brother-in-law, a state trooper, though it ruled that her subsequent decision to fire the police chief was lawful. Palin's version: that the finding meant she'd been \"cleared of any legal wrongdoing or unethical activity at all,\" something she said she greatly appreciated.</p> <p>As you may recall, there is another candidate in this election. He spent the weekend campaigning in Ohio, where a new poll had him closing in on McCain. And it seemed that the Clintons, after a decidedly lukewarm few weeks, were finally throwing their weight behind him: they both campaigned alongside Joe Biden this weekend in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where Biden was born and where Hillary Clinton's father grew up. They'll follow up with more events this week.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>McCain and Palin focus their efforts on Virginia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania today, and how negative they choose to get will be closely monitored. They're also due to attend their final joint fundraiser tomorrow, in Manhattan, reportedly seeking to raise $5m. Obama will be in Ohio today, with Biden in New Hampshire and Delaware - and the spotlight is beginning to turn to Hempstead, on Long Island, where Obama and McCain will meet on Wednesday for their final debate.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Obama's lead over McCain was slightly reduced in Gallup's daily tracking poll yesterday, from 51%-42% to 50%-43%; likewise, Rasmussen had the candidates on 51%-45%, one point down from Obama's lead the previous day, which was 52%-45%. A Newsweek poll has Obama leading 52% to 41%, and shows he now leads McCain among men, women, and every age group of voters, including those over 65, though McCain still leads among independents, 45% to 43%.</p> <h2>Quote of the weekend</h2> <p>\"After I whip his you-know-what in this debate, we're going to be going out 24/7.\" John McCain at the weekend, proving that there are some things to which he will not stoop - for example, saying the word \"ass\".</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip\">Follow the Guardian's US road trip from LA to Washington</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/13/uselections2008-johnmccain\">McCain tones down campaign as critics say tactics incite hatred</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/13/uselection-vote-florida-obama\">Young make 'great schlep' to persuade a sceptical generation to vote Obama</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/12/uselections2008-barackobama\">Stryker McGuire: The election is not in the bag.

  "<p>On Wednesday, <a href=\"http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2008/10/9/74317/9123\">John McCain told Fox News' Sean Hannity </a>that his VP pick Sarah Palin is \"probably one of the foremost experts in this nation on energy issues,\" and reaffirmed his desire to put her in charge of energy policy in his administration.</p> <p>But on Thursday, Palin once again mangled the facts about energy issues, wrongly asserting to a crowd in Wisconsin that there's some sort of congressional ban on oil exports.</p> <p>A crowd member told her he had heard that 75 percent of Alaska's oil is being sold to China, and if that's true, he wanted to know why.</p> <p>\"No. It's not 75 percent of our oil being exported,\" Palin said, suggesting that some of Alaska's oil is going abroad, but not that much, according to the Associated Press.</p> <p>\"In fact, Congress is pretty strict on, um, export bans of oil and gas especially,\" she continued.</p> <p>The AP reporter fact-checked the assertion:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>No Alaska oil has been exported since 2004, and little if any since 2000, according to the Energy Information Administration and the Congressional Research Service.</p> <p>And Congress has never imposed outright bans on oil exports. Congress prohibited exports of Alaska oil in 1973 when the Alaska oil pipeline was built. But that ban was lifted in 1996 when there were large volumes of Alaska oil coming down from the North Slope and U.S. demand was soft.</p> <p>The Alaska ban has never been reinstated.</p> </blockquote> <p>Though natural gas exports must be approved by the Energy Department, there isn't the same stipulation for oil. According to the Energy Information Administration, more than 95 million barrels of Alaskan oil -- or about 2.7 percent of the total produced in Alaska -- were exported between 1996 and 2004, the majority of it to South Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan. The EIA states that there have been no Alaskan oil exports since 2004, but that's not because of any congressional restriction on exports.</p> <p>This isn't the first time that Palin has misstated the facts about Alaska and energy supplies. Last month, she claimed that Alaska provides \"20 percent\" of the nation's energy. In fact, it provides just 3.5 percent, and several fact-checking sites have since thoroughly debunked her claim. And the natural-gas pipeline she keeps touting as evidence of her success in energy policy? It only exists on paper, and the necessary federal approval is still years away.</p>",

But even such off-Broadway sketch shows as the bluntly titled <a href=\"http://www.robertaonthearts.com/id508.html\">Bush Is Bad</a> called it quits some while ago: discussion of the \"badness\" of the current president no doubt pales next to an economy that is worsening by the minute. <br> It's scant surprise that the one American play I've come across of late even to begin to engage with topical events - Christopher Shinn's Now or Later - has been given its premiere in London at <a href=\"http://www.royalcourttheatre.com\">the Royal Court</a>, and not on Shinn's home turf. Away from the Broadway mainstream, New York's smaller venues are too busy mining the back catalogue of JB Priestley (the American debut of his 1957 <a href=\"http://www.minttheatre.org\">The Glass Cage</a>) and Sarah Kane (the first New York showing of <a href=\"http://www.sohorep.org\">Blasted</a>) to attempt to reflect or comment upon today's headlines. <br> Not that the candidates tend to reciprocate with much of an enquiry into the arts of their own, though Barack Obama has at least addressed the issue rather more than <a href=\"http://www.artsjournal.com/culturegrrl/2008/10/finally_finding_john_mccains_a.html\">John McCain</a>. In fact, though <a href=\"http://arts.endow.gov/news/news07/Budget2008.html\">government funding for the arts</a> in the US has actually gone up some $20m in the last year, very much contrary to expectation, it's especially difficult to put centre stage an art form that by its very nature seems elitist at a time when people are struggling to hang on to their homes and to put petrol in their tank. And since \"elite\", as we know, has been branded a dirty word, theatre and the political debate will doubtless continue their ever-divergent paths. <br> Until such time, I suppose, as George W and co pitch up at a Broadway performance of ... hmm, what would be their taste?

As host and trail-blazer for the paper's 'On the road to the White House' series for Election 08, Maron and a team of film-makers aim to capture the heart and soul of an increasingly troubled America. </p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338523513\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1853072260_MARC-MARON.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Just how are ordinary Americans in the heartland reacting to the political storm that characterises Election 08? How do they feel about their country and their future with an African-American politician now the favourite to become president? Or can John McCain reach beyond his core grassroots Republican support to win back enough of America's middle ground? </p> <p>Marc Maron sets out to find out what's ailing Americans, find out how they're getting through these turbulent times and, in the process, find out a thing or two about himself. After the failure of his second marriage he says he's had his own 'depression' - now he's wondering how his country is going to cope with its economic version. </p> <p>With two mobile units criss-crossing the United States, from California right through many of the key swing states and finishing up in Washington DC, the Guardian's On the Road documentary road trip will provide a singular insight into the political, social and economic concerns of America's citizenry. And, each day, new filmed reports will provide a uniquely varied portrait of how they're thinking, what they're thinking - and what they really care about. </p> <p>\u2022 Marc Maron is a veteran of film, television, stand-up comedy and radio. He's made more than 40 appearances on Late Nite with Conan O'Brien, appeared several times on The Late Show with David Letterman, has done half-hour specials on HBO and Comedy Central, and was the host of Morning Sedition and The Marc Maron Show on Air America Radio. </p> <p>He now co-hosts the daily video show Maron v Seder at <a href=\"http://mvslive.com/\">mvslive.com</a>. Marc lives in New York and LA, but his primary residence is his mind, which is in a bad neighbourhood.</p>",
  "<p>California State University in Northridge, a huge pubic university in Los Angeles's San Fernando Valley, has its own Spanish-language student newspaper and web site, <a href=\"http://www.csun.edu/elnuevosol/\">El Nuevo Sol</a>.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338520009\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1851735885_FINAL-Latin-Youth-Vote-AIC-FLV-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Its young editors represent the diversity within the city's Latino population: although much of the debate over immigration centers on Mexican Americans, many of these students belong to a growing Central American community. </p> <p>In the offices of El Nuevo Sol last week, the student editors debated the pros and cons of the presidential candidates - in the end coming out for Obama, though none too enthusiastically. </p> <p>While none of them favors McCain, they acknowledge that in recent decades, whatever little immigration reform has come was put forth not by Democrats, but by Republicans. </p> <p>While \"amnesty\" is now a dirty word among the anti-immigration forces, it was Ronald Reagan, in 1986, who signed into law <a href=\"http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1986/110686b.htm\">the immigration bill that placed millions of undocumented immigrants on the road to citizenship</a>. And while Hillary Clinton argued during the primaries that the Republican approach to immigration reform would \"criminalise Jesus,\" it was Bill Clinton, in 1996, who signed <a href=\"http://www.ilw.com/micasa/home.htm\">one of the most restrictive and punitive immigration bills in recent history</a>. The young journalists can only hope Obama will do better.</p> <p>Both of the current candidates once showed promise on the issue. John McCain, in an earlier, less right-wing mode, joined with Ted Kennedy in an <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2007/02/28/kennedy_mccain_try_again_on_immigration/\">unsuccessful attempt to wring a bipartisan immigration reform bill out of the Democratic-controlled Congress</a>, while Barack Obama at one point seemed poised to take on immigration as a civil rights issue, and supported the <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blogs/notion?pid=76067\">May Day immigrants' rights demonstrations</a> in 2006.</p> <p>But both candidates have since backed away from talking about their positions, apparently not wanting to rile the powerful feelings that surround the debate on both sides, and immigration has become the issue that dare not speak its name in the 2008 election. </p> <p>This state of affairs is ironic, considering the fact that year, as never before, <a href=\"http://www.hispanicprwire.com/news.php?l=in&amp;id=7635&amp;cha=10\">Latinos of all backgrounds are a force in the presidential election</a>, and both candidates are actively courting their votes - and <a href=\"http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2008/06/obama-and-the-l.html\">Obama, it appears, winning most of them</a>. </p> <p>The Latino community itself has been highly mobilised, and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95090073\">promises to turn out in record numbers</a>: Here in Los Angeles, the Coalition for Humane Immigration Reform of Los Angeles (CHIRLA) recently announced that it had <a href=\"http://www.chirla.org/node?page=\" 1\" tk\">registered 24,000 new voters</a>, most of them at naturalization ceremonies. And in a number of key swing states, the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/402/index.html\">Latino vote could tip the electoral college in either direction</a>. Yet young Latino voters like those here at Northridge are faced with choosing between two candidates who offer next to nothing on the questions that matter to them most.</p>"
