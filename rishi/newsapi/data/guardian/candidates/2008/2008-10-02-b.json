  "<p>Britain found itself thrown into the US presidential election after the leak of a letter from its ambassador to Washington, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, offering a frank assessment of Barack Obama, commenting on his inexperience and aloofness as well as his intelligence and \"star quality\".</p> <p>The leak of the seven-page letter to Gordon Brown undermines British efforts to abide by the convention of neutrality in US elections.</p> <p>The letter is mainly complimentary about Obama but also highlights his perceived weaknesses. Sheinwald wrote that Obama \"does betray a highly educated and upper middle class mindset\". He adds that accusations of elitism \"are not entirely unfair\" and he is \"maybe aloof, insensitive\" at times.</p> <p>The ambassador, who was last night in Los Angeles, suggested in the letter that an Obama presidency could present problems for the UK over his plan to negotiate directly with the Iranian leadership.</p> <p>Although Brown is ideologically closer to the Democrats, he has tried to remain neutral between Obama and his Republican rival John McCain, though an article written in his name last month which praised Obama caused embarrassment. </p> <p>The British embassy in Washington said last night: \"We do not comment on leaked documents. We are totally neutral as far as the US elections are concerned and we look forward to working closely with whoever is elected.\"</p> <p>The letter, leaked to the Daily Telegraph is classified, marked \"sensitive judgements\" and requests officials to \"protect the contents carefully\". It was prepared before Obama's visit to Downing Street in the summer as part of a tour to the Middle East and Europe.</p> <p>A leak inquiry has been launched.</p> <p>The letter will play into the election campaign as it was picked up almost immediately last night on publication by US websites such as Drudge.</p> <p>It is part of the job of the ambassador to offer such assessments of an incoming president and Sheinwald has been out on the campaign trail, including attending the Democratic convention in Denver, Colorado, and the Republican one in St Paul, Minnesota, building up portraits of the two candidates. He described Obama's voting record as \"decidedly liberal\" and pointed up his lack of experience. \"Although he has been a member of the Senate foreign relations committee for four years, and a regular attender of meetings in his first two, there is little Obama track record to refer back to,\" he says.</p> <p>He attributed Obama's rise in part to luck, including that \"Hillary Clinton had such a bad organisation in the primary campaign, and took so long to respond to Obama's threat\".</p> <p>Describing Obama's approach to politics, he noted the senator has emerged from the tough Chicago political background but that he \"can seem to sit on the fence, assiduously balancing pros and cons\".</p> <p>He added: \"He can talk too dispassionately for a national campaign about issues which touch people personally, eg his notorious San Francisco comments [in April] about small-town Pennsylvanians 'clinging' to guns and religion.\"</p> <p>Sheinwald, appointed by Tony Blair, has been a relatively low-key presence in Washington compared with some of his predecessors. </p> <p>In the letter, the ambassador also described Obama as \"elegant\", \"mesmerising\", \"highly intelligent\" and having \"star quality\".</p> <p>He anticipated a potential problem over Iran, given Obama's comment that he was prepared to sit down for talks with the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.</p> <p>\"If Obama wins, we will need to consider with him the articulation between (a) his desire for 'unconditional' dialogue with Iran and (b) our and the [United Nations Security Council]'s requirement of prior suspension of enrichment before the nuclear negotiations proper can begin.\"</p> <p>But Obama's Iraq policy of withdrawal fitted in with Britain's.</p> <p>\"Whatever the detail, our own proposed transition in south-east Iraq would be consistent with Obama's likely approach. Obama's ideas on a more expansive regional framework for Iraq would also fit well with our thinking.\"</p> <p>He wrote approvingly of Mr Obama's \"mainstream team of youthful economic advisers, with strong credentials [who] approach policy with refreshingly few prescriptions\", his \"progressive position on climate change\" and his \"pragmatic realism\" and \"balanced approach to the big security issues\".</p> <p>Sir Nigel concludes that searching for a deal between Israel and the Palestinians is \"unlikely to be a top priority for Obama\" and he expresses concern about his protectionist trade policy, while noting that he has \"repositioned himself somewhat towards free trade\".</p>",
  "<p>'They have waited until something has cracked and then at the last moment have sought to prevent total collapse.\" Those words, which could so easily have come from one of the congressional representatives who this week voted down the proposed federal bail-out of the American banking industry, were spoken by Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932.</p> <p>A precipitous collapse in stock market prices, millions defaulting on mortgage repayments, an unpopular president blamed for neglecting the plight of ordinary Americans. As the current economic crisis in the US unfolds, many people are asking whether this is history repeating itself. Are we witnessing a rerun of the stock market crash and subsequent Great Depression? What lessons can be, or should have been, learned from that earlier national emergency?</p> <p>\"The past,\" once observed Pulitzer prizewinning author Robert Penn Warren, \"is always a rebuke to the present.\" And there are certainly clear parallels between the present crisis and events of eight decades ago. In both cases, the economic collapse came after a period of political dominance by the Republican party. The 1920s saw three successive Republican politicians elected to the White House: Warren G Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. These administrations shared a fervent commitment to laissez faire capitalism, encouraging growth through tax cuts, low interest rates and minimum business regulation. Coolidge encapsulated Republican faith in the free market economy in the aphoristic observation: \"The business of America is business.\"</p> <p>Similarly, the last three decades have been a period of renewed Republican party hegemony, interrupted only by the two terms that Bill Clinton served as president. Successive administrations have championed the growth of commerce unfettered by government regulation. Even Clinton, a political centrist who abandoned many of the progressive legacies of Democratic presidents such as Roosevelt and Lyndon B Johnson, did little to control the excesses of Wall Street.</p> <p>In the 1920s, as now, political leaders created the conditions that precipitated economic crisis. In both instances, a lack of effective regulatory oversight fostered a climate of reckless speculation on the stock market. And just like the federal government in 1929, the current administration failed to see the emergency coming.</p> <p>\"I have no fears for the future of our country,\" boasted Hoover at his inaugural address in March 1929. \"It is bright with hope. We shall soon be in sight of the day when, God willing, poverty will be banished from this nation.\" Seven months later, the stock market crash precipitated an economic crisis unprecedented in the nation's history.</p> <p>In a speech last November, George Bush emphasised the continuing growth of the American economy. \"Sure, there's some challenges facing us,\" he complacently suggested, \"but the underpinnings of our economy are strong.\" Even as warnings that the country was heading towards disaster became louder, the president emphasised his administration was \"on top of the situation\". Given his earlier optimism, the recent televised address in which Bush predicted that the US faces a \"long and painful recession\" was a painful admission of his lack of foresight.</p> <p>The American economy still has a long way to fall before it reaches the depths of the Great Depression, of course. The US is technically still not even in a recession, and only just over 6% of American workers are out of a job. The economic situation is nonetheless hurting many ordinary Americans who are losing their jobs, finding themselves with little disposable income and defaulting on mortgage loans. It is also important to recall that Americans did not experience the worst excesses of the Great Depression until some years after the stock market crash. We may not yet have felt the full force of the current crisis.</p> <p>The suffering that followed the crash of 1929 was appalling. From 1929 to 1933, farm income halved, industrial production stood at 40% of capacity and unemployment rose to one in four Americans. Hungry men and women lined the streets for their next meal from the local soup kitchen, homeless people huddled in hastily erected shantytowns on the outskirts of many cities, and thousands hitched rides on railroad cars in search of a job. </p> <p>The collapse of the agricultural economy drove farmers from the land. Dust storms and evictions displaced more than a million rural labourers, whose plight John Steinbeck portrayed in The Grapes of Wrath. Industrial and manufacturing workers fared no better. The coal and textile industries were first to suffer, but were soon followed by other sectors of the economy. Homeless families in Arkansas huddled in caves; others in California found refuge in sewers. \"We saw want and despair walking the streets,\" observed a Chicago social worker, \"and our friends, sensible, thrifty families, reduced to poverty.\" The American birth rate fell to its lowest level while the suicide rate reached its highest.</p> <p>The anguish of the American people is captured in the thousands of letters they wrote to the White House in search of help. One woman from New York State sent a letter to Eleanor Roosevelt in which she asked for a loan to buy clothes for her new baby. \"Please, Mrs Roosevelt,\" she begged, \"I do not want charity, only a chance from someone who will trust me until we can get enough money to repay the amount spent for the things we need.\" As proof of her sincerity, she enclosed in the envelope two of her dearest possessions, a ring worn by her mother and another given to her as a gift by her husband.</p> <p>For African Americans things were even bleaker. The collapse of the cotton market led to the displacement of thousands of black sharecroppers in the southern states. Many migrated to urban areas but racial discrimination restricted their access to jobs and government relief programmes.</p> <p>Once again, minorities, still overrepresented among America's poor, have borne the brunt of the economic burden that now afflicts Americans. Sub-prime mortgage lenders aggressively targeted minorities who otherwise were unable to afford their own homes. According to the Harvard University's Joint Centre for Housing Studies, 55% of African Americans and 45% of Latinos who became homeowners in 2005 did so through sub-prime mortgages, compared with only 17% of whites. </p> <p>The sub-prime mortgage crisis has hit minorities hard, with many suffering foreclosures. Last year, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People filed a lawsuit against sub-prime mortgage lenders it accuses of \"institutionalised racism\" because of their predatory behaviour. Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza, a Latino civil rights organisation, similarly affirms that high-interest loans to poorer minorities are \"eroding the hard-earned wealth our communities spent decades fighting for\".</p> <p>In 1929, there were few safety nets to catch people whose livelihoods collapsed. With his New Deal, Roosevelt revolutionised the role of government as a provider for the dispossessed through the introduction of such measures as the minimum wage, unemployment relief and aid to dependent children. Despite swingeing cuts to the provision of welfare in recent times, there are now far greater protections in place for ordinary people than in the 1930s.</p> <p>Perhaps as a result, there are also no indications that the current economic crisis is tearing at the social fabric of the US in the same way as the Great Depression. Demonstrations by unemployed and homeless people shook many cities during the 1930s. Fears grew that a fascist demagogue could use grassroots unrest as a means to seize power in Washington, a scenario enacted in Sinclair Lewis' satirical novel It Can't Happen Here. While the US is not about to become a fascist dictatorship, there is a possibility of more serious social unrest should the crisis deepen further.</p> <p>The stakes are high. Bush's handling of the economy may prove decisive to this year's presidential election, as was true in 1932. The dour President Hoover appeared to many Americans uncaring and unable to appreciate the scale of the problem that beset the country. </p> <p>In 1930, Hoover introduced higher trade tariffs to protect American manufacturers from foreign competition. The Smoot-Hawley Act led to a protectionist war between the US and other countries. American exports and imports fell sharply, crippling businesses, which laid off workers in ever higher numbers. The president became so unpopular that the shantytowns erected by homeless people became known as \"Hoovervilles\" and an empty pocket turned inside out a \"Hoover flag\".</p> <p>The public perception that Hoover had failed either to avert or remedy the economic crisis led to his resounding defeat to Democratic challenger Franklin Roosevelt in the presidential election of 1932. Roosevelt won a landslide victory with 22.8m votes to Hoover's 15.7m. How the US government acts now is very important, but while Bush is unlikely to repeat Hoover's mistakes, so far he has lacked the vision of Roosevelt.</p> <p>One of the most striking contrasts between the past and present economic crises concerns presidential rhetoric. \"The only thing we have to fear,\" proclaimed Roosevelt in his inaugural address of March 1933, \"is fear itself.\" The Great Depression had a profound psychological as well as material impact on Americans, shattering their individual and collective self-confidence. In times of unprecedented trouble, Roosevelt sought to restore public optimism through his regular radio broadcasts, the \"fireside chats\" in which he presented himself as not only a politician but a personal friend to ordinary Americans.</p> <p>In sharp contrast, the address that Bush delivered to rally support for the bail-out plan exploited public fears. \"Our entire economy is in danger,\" the president warned. \"Without immediate action by Congress, America could slip into a financial panic and a distressing scenario would unfold.\" If the strategy was to scare Congress into endorsing the plan with little or no amendments, it clearly failed. Although the Senate approval of an amended plan places members of the House of Representatives under increasing pressure to support the administration, the outcome of a further vote is still not certain. </p> <p>With his poll rating already disastrously low because of his mishandling of the Iraq war, Bush has suffered a further blow to his credibility as a result of the economic collapse. According to a poll conducted by the American Research Group last month, only 19% of Americans approve of how the president is handling the economy, while 76% disapprove. </p> <p>Unlike Hoover, Bush is not seeking re-election. The crisis in the financial market has nonetheless similarly undermined popular trust in the Republicans while providing political capital for the Democrats. John McCain, who concedes his limited expertise in economic matters, has attempted to reinvent himself as a populist champion against Wall Street. His efforts to dissociate himself from the pro-business policies of the Bush administration appear, however, to be in vain.</p> <p>With the economy now the central issue in the election, Americans are increasingly placing their faith in Barack Obama to deliver the country from its current crisis. In what has been a tightly contested race, that advantage could prove decisive when Americans go to the polls on November 4.</p> <p>A fundamental weakness of the American economy in the 1920s was the unequal distribution of wealth. Although the average wage of workers increased during that decade, the economic elite benefited far more from cuts in personal and corporate income taxes. Rather than borrow more, ordinary Americans cut back on consumer purchases, creating chronic deflation. The situation is strikingly similar today. Millions of debt-ridden Americans cannot afford to repay mortgages, triggering a collapse in the housing market.</p> <p>During the presidential campaign of 1932, Roosevelt gave a speech in which he spoke of the failure of the federal government to address the needs of the Forgotten Man. Washington, he asserted, had \"sought temporary relief from the top down rather than permanent relief from the bottom up\". This is precisely the criticism that many Americans are now making about the plan to bail out the banking industry.</p> <p>There is one further lesson from history that the federal government will need to consider should economic conditions deteriorate further. Although much of the blame for the current crisis is attributable to the recklessness of Wall Street, bailing out the economic elites will not address the problems that afflict Main Street. The New Deal programmes of the Roosevelt administration represented an unprecedented expansion of government intervention in the economy. Yet they failed to work. Although Washington provided relief and opportunities to millions of Americans, the country remained in a perilous state. On the eve of US intervention in the second world war, nine million Americans were still out of work. </p> <p>Perhaps the most frightening lesson of history is that the mobilisation for war and the factory-employment opportunities it created accomplished what government economic reform programmes could not. By contrast, the current military conflict in which the US is embroiled only compounds its economic problems. The expenditure of billions of dollars on the war on terror drains resources that could be spent on the domestic economy, imposing a tax burden on ordinary people that restricts their disposable income. Nothing less than a radical restructuring of the economy, from the grassroots up, will fix today's mess.</p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong>Clive Webb is reader in American history at the University of Sussex</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday October 9 2008.

  "<p>Barack Obama, building on a shift in the public mood on the economy, went on the offensive yesterday against John McCain, with a rally in a Republican enclave in the battleground state of Michigan.</p> <p>Obama's four-hour visit to Grand Rapids, the hometown of the late Republican president Gerald Ford, marked an aggressive new attempt to win over working- and middle-class white voters worried about the economic crisis.</p> <p>The Wall Street meltdown and attempts in Congress to pass a bailout package have hurt McCain, opening a perceptible lead for Obama in Michigan and other states. A poll for Associated Press yesterday showed Obama pulling away in Michigan and Pennsylvania, which the Democrats must hold to win the White House.</p> <p>Obama was beating McCain in Ohio and Florida, which voted for George Bush in 2004, and was in a strong position in longtime Republican states such as Indiana, Virginia and North Carolina. That could see the Democrats once again expanding the map of battleground states.</p> <p>The Democrat plans to hunker down in North Carolina next week to prepare for his second presidential debate against McCain. But the debate camp would also give him a chance to gauge his prospects for picking a real fight with the Republican for North Carolina. Obama's visit to Grand Rapids appeared in line with that more aggressive strategy which saw him venturing outside traditional Democratic areas of the state such as the heavily African American city of Detroit. </p> <p>In his speech yesterday, Obama attacked McCain as out of touch with people in Michigan, the state with the highest unemployment rate in the country. </p> <p>\"Nine straight months of job loss! Yet, just two weeks ago, John McCain said the 'fundamentals of the economy are strong'. Well, I don't know what yardstick Senator McCain uses, but where I come from, there's nothing more fundamental than a job,\" he said.</p> <p>Obama went on to blame the Wall Street crisis on the Republican philosophy of deregulation, which he linked to McCain. \"My opponent's talked a lot about getting tough on Wall Street, but in the past decades, he's fought against the rules of the road that could've stopped this mess.\"</p> <p>The foray by Obama into Republican terrain brought an immediate push back from the McCain camp, which accused him of seeking to raise taxes. \"No amount of rhetorical eloquence can explain away his 94 votes in favour of higher taxes or his call to raise taxes on the those who make only $42,000 a year,\" a statement said.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's campaign for the White House is receiving increasing complaints about scam pollsters involved in dirty tricks operations to discredit the Democratic candidate.</p> <p>Victims claim the fake pollsters work insinuations into their questions, designed to damage <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Obama</a>. Those targeted in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/22/uselections2008.republicans\">swing states</a> such as Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania include Jews, Christian evangelicals, Catholics and Latinos.</p> <p>One of those to protest, Debbie Minden, who lives in a predominantly Jewish neighbourhood, Squirrel Hill, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, told the Guardian that the pollster had begun by asking her the usual questions about her background and who she would vote for.</p> <p>But the pollster went on to ask Minden, who is Jewish, how she would vote if she knew that Obama was supported by Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza and was responsible for most of the suicide bombings against Israel. \"It is scare tactics. It is terribly underhand,\" she said.</p> <p>The groups behind such polls have not been identified. One of the Republican groups working on behalf of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>'s campaign, the Republican Jewish Coalition, acknowledges carrying out a survey about Jewish voters' views on Obama and Israel, but insists it was a legitimate exercise intended to test campaign messages on Jewish voters.</p> <p>The RJC angrily dismissed comparisons between its exercise and a \"push poll\", the technique of using fake surveys to sway voters. Its poll was restricted to 750 people whereas push polls usually involve phoning thousands of people. It asked 82 questions, only 10% of which were devoted to Obama.</p> <p>The technique of push polling is part of the election battle being fought on the ground in the swing states where the margins of victory have been narrow in past elections.</p> <p>On a bigger scale, teams from each campaign are engaged in legal fights over who is entitled to vote, with Republican groups trying to have people in largely Democratic neighbourhoods disqualified.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/feb/19/uselections2000.usa2\">Push polling </a>was used with stunning effect in the 2000 Republican primary campaign in South Carolina where people claiming to be pollsters insinuated that McCain, then fighting George Bush for the party nomination, had illegitimately fathered a black child.</p> <p>Bush went on to overturn McCain's double-digit poll lead in the primaries, and the origin of the calls was never fully established.</p> <p>This year, the tactic surfaced again during the Republican primaries when calls were made highlighting the religion of one of the candidates, Mitt Romney - he is a Mormon, a religion viewed with suspicion by some on the Christian right.</p> <p>An Obama campaign organiser in one of the swing states said there had been lots of complaints about push polling in his patch. Callers said questions frequently included a reference to the widespread belief that Obama is a Muslim, even though he has repeatedly said he is a Christian.</p> <p>The organiser said another question was: would you be less likely to vote for Obama if Israel had to give up all of Jerusalem? \"They make this shit up. They are good at it. The unassuming listener will not realise it is untrue,\" he said.</p> <p>Minden, a school psychologist, received a call on a Sunday afternoon in the middle of last month. Living in a swing state, she was not surprised to be polled. \"It sounded like a normal poll. Was I voting? Demographics? Age? Where we live? Then a question about which party I supported, who I preferred on the economy, on foreign policy, questions like that.</p> <p>\"They said; 'Are you Jewish?' and I said 'Yeh'. Then they said 'if you knew Barack Obama was supported by Hamas, would it change your vote? Would it change your vote if you knew his church had made antisemitic statements?'. All the hot button issues on Israel.\" She said she will vote for Obama as planned.</p> <p>In Key West, Florida, another swing state, Joelna Marcus, 71, a retired professor, had a similar experience. She was asked if she would be influenced if she learned that Obama had donated money to the Palestine Liberation Organisation.</p> <p>Marcus has since disconnected her telephone.</p> <p>The Huffington Post website reported that a reader, named Rachel from Strongsville, Ohio, complained of a push poll that portrayed Obama as a radical leftwinger who had voted to let convicted child sex offenders out early and to allow them to live near schools.</p>",
  "<p>Genetics is now so influential that it is easily forgotten that it is a relatively young branch of science, and many of those who established its present importance were active in research only from the 1950s onwards. One of those individuals was John Thoday, former professor of genetics at Cambridge University, who has died aged 91.</p> <p>He was born in Derbyshire to botanist parents who inspired his interest in the subject from an early age. When he was six, the family moved to Bangor on the appointment of his father, David, to the chair of botany at the University of North Wales. John went on to read genetics there, during which time he developed an interest in the genetic basis for heritable variation. Graduating in 1939, he began study for a PhD at Trinity College, Cambridge. </p> <p>The timing was not good. His studies were interrupted by war service in aerial photographic intelligence for the RAF, which took him to postings in Cairo and Algiers. In later years he would relish recounting his experiences of the heat, the dust, the flies and the chaos and confusion of war, but also of the camaraderie enjoyed by many of his generation who served. </p> <p>Demobbed with a commission in 1945, he resumed his academic studies, gaining his first job the following year as a radiobiologist at Mount Vernon hospital in Hertfordshire. This was just after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the realisation that science urgently needed to know more about the effects of radiation. While at Mount Vernon, Thoday made the significant discovery that the presence of oxygen increases the ability of X-rays to break and damage chromosomes.</p> <p>In 1947 he moved to Sheffield University where, over the next decade, he began research into the basis and evolutionary significance of differences between individuals, establishing his reputation. He published an important paper in 1953 on the genetic components of fitness for evolutionary survival, initiating a research programme using the fruit fly drosophila, aimed at locating those genetic factors which contributed to the continuous variation of characteristics such as height, weight or crop yields. Working with such seemingly esoteric characters as the number of hairs on the side of a fly, genetic methods were developed to place such polygenes on the genetic map. The principles and concepts developed in this work were seminal to developments 20 and 30 years later in human genetics.</p> <p>Having established a department of genetics at Sheffield, Thoday moved to Cambridge in 1960, to the Arthur Balfour professorship. His brief was to build up the department, and despite opposition from many colleagues to his championing what to them was an upstart scientific discipline, he was brilliantly successful. When he retired in 1983, he presided over a thriving research department and had played a significant role both in university administration and as a fellow of Emmanuel College, where he is still remembered as a keen bowls player. </p> <p>Perhaps his greatest contribution was in highlighting the fundamental importance of genetic differences between individuals in understanding how biology and evolution actually operate. From the 1960s until fairly recently, genetics was divided into two camps. In one camp were molecular biologists who were fascinated by trying to understand the molecules that drove heredity, the structure of DNA and how that information in DNA was expressed in cells and organisms. In the other camp were population biologists who were primarily interested in genetic differences and how these drove the processes of evolution and natural selection. Thoday maintained that although a student might choose to specialise in either the molecular aspects or the whole organism aspects of the subject, they should always be able to understand what the other camp was talking about. </p> <p>This breadth of approach is particularly relevant today, when DNA sequencing technology allows investigation of genetic variation directly at the DNA level and has brought the molecular techniques into population and evolutionary studies, most notably through the human haplotype mapping project and its successors. This interaction is having a huge impact on our studies of human disease, plant and animal breeding, and of our understanding of the mechanisms that drive evolution. Although the technology for investigating these problems has changed, the concepts that underlie this research were originally set out in the 1950s and 60s by Thoday and others in the same field. His contributions were recognised by his election to a fellowship of the Royal Society in 1965. He served as president of the Genetical Society from 1975 to 1977.</p> <p>Thoday had a penetrating intelligence and relished the cut and thrust of debate on a wide range of topics. He described himself as an old-fashioned liberal, who believed in democracy despite its defects, and he had a lifelong contempt of and scepticism for views which depended on dogma. In terms of the classic nature versus nurture debate, his understanding of the complex interactions between genes and the environment made him despair equally of genetic determinism and of those who contended that environment lay at the root of society's problems. At a time when many university professors were aloof and distant figures, he could regularly be found in the bar of the local pub playing darts with his staff and research students. Cheerful, ebullient and convivial, he left an indelible mark on genetics. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Doris, a sociologist and Fellow of Lucy Cavendish College, and by a son and daughter.</p> <p>\u2022 John Marion Thoday, geneticist, born August 30 1916; died August 25 2008</p>",
  "<p>John McCain conceded a crucial battleground to Barack Obama yesterday, pulling staff out of Michigan to try to shore up his campaign in other states.</p> <p>The first big battleground state to be surrendered by either candidate marks the most concrete acknowledgement to date from the McCain camp that the Republican was losing ground because of the economic turmoil and the $700bn bail-out of Wall Street.</p> <p>\"The winds that drive presidential campaigns can shift and shift suddenly. I have no doubt the campaign will be back,\" the Republican state party chairman, Saul Anuzis, said.</p> <p>Campaign officials told a conference call that resources would be moved to the battleground states of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania as well as Maine, which had not been thought to be in contention.</p> <p>\"If we see a swing back in our favour, we will re-engage,\" said Mike Duhaime, a Republican strategist.</p> <p>But Republicans acknowledged that the retrenchment in Michigan would make it more difficult for McCain to put together a winning combination.</p> <p>The abrupt decision follows a striking rise for Obama in local opinion polls and an aggressive push by Obama, who spent four hours in the state yesterday, holding a rally in the Republican enclave of Grand Rapids.</p> <p>The Democrats plan to focus on North Carolina next week as Obama stays there to prepare for his second presidential debate against McCain.</p>",
  "<p>Former Art Blakey Jazz Messengers and Betty Carter pianist Hicks died in 2006, and this group (curated by Hicks' flautist widow Elise Wood-Hicks) celebrates the graceful boppish music of one of jazz music's unpushiest virtuosi, with the lively pianist Larry Willis stepping up to his old friend's plate. The title track is a sprightly swinger with a wealth of canny melodic elements, as is the relaxed and breathily lilting Blues in the Pocket - and if After the Morning is a rather slight waltz for Wood-Hicks' subdued flute, it also features the more energised sound of Craig Handy's soprano sax, and plenty of Willis' grinning trills. Trumpeter Eddie Henderson, one of the most soulfully intelligent of Miles Davis' pre-funk disciples, guests on three tracks, and his poised but unexpectedly twisting phrasing enhances the set. Naima's Love Song, a Hicks classic, also draws out some effortlessly nimble and warm-toned Henderson flugelhorn playing. Preserving the memory of this gifted pianist/composer is an enterprise that's hard to fault, though the band does sound a bit lost in its rhythmic purpose at times, and undecided between a chamber-jazzy reserve and Hicks' famous full-on drive.</p>",
  "<p>John Houston, who has died aged 78 after a brief illness, was one of the most distinguished painters of the postwar Scottish school, which is another way of saying he was as distinguished as any British painter of his generation. Over many years, he had regular and substantial exhibitions in London, for the most part with the much-missed Mercury gallery in Cork Street. If the reputation of this proud, and at times fearsome, Scot never really spread beyond his native borders, it is but further evidence of the scandal of the English critical neglect of the Scottish school at large. After all, our leading gallery does call itself Tate Britain. </p> <p>Houston's work is characteristic of modern Scottish painting, direct in the statement, rich in colour and the actual stuff of the paint as it rests on the surface. It is a natural, sensual, almost hedonistic expressionism, yet it is in no sense indulgent, but founded rather in a deeply sympathetic consideration and understanding of the broader European expressionist tradition, extending back to the Fauves. Indeed, it is worth remembering that Scottish painters were responding long before the English to the more radical aspects of post-impressionism in the years before the first world war. For the judiciously eclectic Houston, Matisse, Nolde, Permeke, Sironi and Beckmann were always to be particular heroes. Though he would include still-life, often on a monumental scale, among his subjects, and the human figure too, it was the landscape - a sea and sky-scape reduced often to near abstraction and fraught with an unspoken symbolism - that would always be his truest subject. The image of the Bass Rock, out in the North Sea off North Berwick, became almost his personal emblem.</p> <p>Houston was born at Buckhaven, in the kingdom of Fife, on the north shore of the Firth of Forth. He grew up at nearby Windygates, where his father's family kept the hotel and village shop. His father himself was, as Houston put it, in more general business - sometime haulier, contractor, dealer of all kinds and of horses in particular. Until he grew too big, Houston would ride for his father at Musselburgh races and other local meetings. At Buckhaven high school, he was successful both academically and at sport, especially football, which was to play a large part in his early life. He won an under-21 international cap, playing for Scotland against England at outside-left, and went on as a part-time professional with Dundee United while at art school. Serious damage to a knee, however, put paid to any football career, and an eye injury excused him from national service.</p> <p>In 1948, he went to Edinburgh College of Art, the largest and best-endowed of Scotland's four great art schools, leaving in 1953 with a postgraduate travel scholarship, which took him to Italy for the first time. The college had always had a strong painting tradition, and there Houston counted William Gillies, Henderson Blyth, Robin Philipson and, as personally influential, Penelope Beaton among his tutors, and Alan Davie, David Michie and Jeffery Camp among his fellow students. The young Elizabeth Blackadder was also a near-contemporary, though it was not until towards the end of his time at Edinburgh that they came together as more than friends. They were to prove inseparable. In 1955 she went on the same scholarship to Italy, where Houston joined her for a while. They were married on her return to Edinburgh the following summer.</p> <p>They then began teaching part-time at the college, appointments confirmed as full-time posts in 1960. Their painting apart, Edinburgh College of Art was to remain central to their working lives until their retirements, Houston finally, in 1989, as deputy to his old friend, David Michie, as head of painting. The Scottish art schools retained the old disciplines long after they were abandoned in England, and the regime, while never prescriptive, was closely ordered, with Gillies, still principal in the 60s, insisting that all his teachers taught across the full range of subjects, from still-life to the life room, and at all levels from the first year to the last. Houston is remembered with affectionate respect by his students, including John Bellany, for firm, but ever sympathetic, guidance and encouragement.</p> <p>But, as with all proper artists in proper art schools, the art comes first, and the Houstons together were never anything but utterly professional in their commitment to their work. They would travel abroad regularly on working trips - latterly to Japan, especially to France, and always to Italy and to much-loved Venice. They were immensely prolific. And while their careers developed over the years - they became Royal Scottish academicians together in 1972 - if John's commitment to his own work ever faltered, it was only in that the unswerving and selfless support he gave to Elizabeth, and the simple pride he took in her spectacular success, always came first. Selecting a Blackadder exhibition long ago, I can hear them still. Elizabeth: \"Oh, you don't want to see that old thing.\" John: \"Oh yes, you must,\" as he pulled a significant early work from the back of the stack in the garage. He was a most generous host, dangerously so when it came to his beloved malts and Burgundies. He was gruff at times, outspoken too, but those of us who knew him will remember rather an open geniality and sympathy of spirit, a knowledge and love of art as wide as deep, a true friend, and a lot of laughter. He was appointed OBE in 1990. Dame Elizabeth survives him.</p> <p>\u2022 John Houston, painter, born April 1 1930; died September 27 2008</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama, building on a shift in the public mood on the economy, today went on the offensive against John McCain, with a rally in a firmly Republican enclave in the battleground state of Michigan.</p> <p>Obama's four-hour visit to Grand Rapids, the hometown of the late Republican president, Gerald Ford, marked an aggressive new attempt to win over working- and middle-class white voters worried about the economic crisis.</p> <p>The Wall Street meltdown and the chaotic attempts in Congress to pass a $700bn bail-out package have hurt McCain, opening up a perceptible lead for Obama in Michigan and other battleground states.</p> <p>A poll for Associated Press today showed Obama pulling away from McCain in Michigan and Pennylvania, which the Democrats need to hold to win the White House.</p> <p>Obama was beating McCain in Ohio and Florida which voted for George Bush in 2004, and was in a strong position in longtime Republican states like Indiana, Virginia, and North Carolina.</p> <p>That could see the Democrats once again expanding the map of battleground states.</p> <p>The Democrat plans to hunker down in North Carolina next week to prepare for his second presidential debate against McCain. But the debate camp would also give him a chance to gauge his prospects for picking a real fight with the Republican for North Carolina.</p> <p>Obama's visit to Grand Rapids appeared in line with that more aggressive strategy which saw him venturing outside traditional Democratic areas of the state, like the heavily African-American city of Detroit.</p> <p>The area around Grand Rapids votes heavily Republican in presidential elections, and the city is a centre of Christian publishing.</p> <p>In his speech today, Obama attacked McCain as out-of-touch with people in Michigan, the state with the highest unemployment rate in the country.</p> <p>\"Nine straight months of job loss! Yet, just two weeks ago, John McCain said the 'fundamentals of the economy are strong'. Well, I don't know what yardstick Senator McCain uses, but where I come from, there's nothing more fundamental than a job,\" he said. \"It's time we had a president who understands that.\"</p> <p>Obama went on to blame the Wall Street crisis on the Republican philosophy of deregulation, which he linked to McCain.</p> <p>\"Despite my opponent's best efforts to make you think otherwise, this is the philosophy he's embraced during his 26 years in Washington,\" he said. \"He's talked a lot about getting tough on Wall Street, but over the past few decades, he's fought against the very rules of the road that could've stopped this mess.\"</p> <p>The foray by Obama into Republican terrain brought an immediate push back from the McCain camp, which accused him of seeking to raise taxes and organised a conference call for reporters with campaign advisers. \"No amount of rhetorical eloquence can explain away his 94 votes in favor of higher taxes or his call to raise taxes on the those who make only $42,000 a year,\" the statement said.</p>",
  "<p>Outgoing transport secretary Ruth Kelly said tonight she would step down from her Bolton West constituency at the next general election.</p> <p>Kelly said it had been an \"honour and a privilege\" to serve the constituency since she was elected in 1997.</p> <p>The mother of four had already announced her intention to quit the cabinet to spend time with her family.</p> <p>In a statement, Kelly said: \"It's been an honour and privilege to serve Bolton West since I was first elected in May 1997.</p> <p>\"I want to say thank you to the people of Blackrod, Horwich, Westhoughton and the rest of West Bolton for all the tremendous warmth and support I've been shown during the last 11 and a half years.</p> <p>\"I've thoroughly enjoyed serving the people of my constituency and intend to continue to keep working diligently for them until the next general election.</p> <p>\"I've taken the area to my heart and will leave with a touch of sadness and fond memories, although I'm sure the decision I have taken is right for myself and my family.\"</p> <p>She listed many of Labour's achievements before giving her backing to Gordon Brown, saying: \"Of course many challenges remain but I'm confident that Labour under the strong leadership of Gordon Brown is well placed to help hard-working families through these difficult times.</p> <p>\"I look forward to campaigning actively for Labour and firmly believe that we can win Bolton West at the next general election.</p> <p>\"Only a Labour Bolton West MP working with a Labour government will build in the years to come on the solid foundations we've already laid.\"</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's campaign is receiving increasing complaints about scam pollsters involved in dirty tricks operations to discredit the Democratic candidate.</p> <p>Victims claim the fake pollsters insinuate into their questions information, often untrue, designed to damage Obama.</p> <p>Those targeted in swing states such as Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania include Jews, Christian evangelicals, Catholics and Latinos.</p> <p>One of those who have protested, Debbie Minden, who lives in a predominantly Jewish neighbourhood, Squirrel Hill in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, said that the pollster had begun by asking her the usual questions about her background and who she would vote for.</p> <p>But the pollster went on to ask Minden, who is Jewish, how she would vote if she knew that Obama was supported by Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza and was responsible for most of the suicide bombings against Israel.</p> <p>\"It is scare tactics. It is terribly underhand,\" she said.</p> <p>The groups behind such polls have not been identified.</p> <p>One of the Republican groups working on behalf of John McCain's campaign, the Republican Jewish Coalition, acknowledges carrying out a survey about Jewish voters' views on Obama and Israel but insists it had been a legitimate exercise intended to test campaign messages on Jewish voters.</p> <p>The RJC angrily dismissed comparisons between its exercise and so-called push polling, the technique of using fake surveys to sway voters. </p> <p>Its poll was restricted to 750 people whereas push polls usually involve phoning thousands. It asked 82 questions, only 10% of which were devoted to Obama.</p> <p>The technique of push polling is part of the election battle being fought on the ground in the swing states where the margins of victory have been narrow in past elections. On a bigger scale, teams from each campaign are engaged in legal fights over who is entitled to vote, with Republican groups trying to have people in largely Democratic neighbourhoods disqualified.</p> <p>Push polling was used with stunning effect in the 2000 Republican primary campaign in South Carolina when an organisation claiming to be pollsters insinuated that McCain, then fighting George W Bush for the party nomination, had illegitimately fathered a black child. </p> <p>Bush overturned McCain's double-digit poll lead, and the origin of the calls was never fully established.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the tactic surfaced again during the Republican <br>primaries when calls were made highlighting the religion of one of the candidates, Mitt Romney - he is a Mormon, a religion viewed with suspicion by some on the Christian right.</p> <p>An Obama campaign organiser in one of the swing states, who is not authorised to speak on the record, said there had been lots of complaints about push polling in his patch. </p> <p>Callers said questions frequently included a reference to the widespread belief that Obama is a Muslim, even though he has repeatedly said he is a Christian.</p> <p>The organiser said another question was: would you be less likely to vote for Obama if Israel had to give up all of Jerusalem? \"They make this shit up. They are good at it. The unassuming listener will not realise it is untrue,\" he said.</p> <p>Minden, a school psychologist, received a call on a Sunday afternoon in the middle of last month.</p> <p>Living in a swing state, she was not surprised to be polled. \"It sounded like a normal poll. Was I voting? Demographics? Age? Where we live? Then a question about which party I supported, who I preferred on the economy, on foreign policy, questions like that.</p> <p>\"They said; 'Are you Jewish?' and I said 'Yeh'. Then they said 'if you knew Barack Obama was supported by Hamas, would it change your vote? Would it change your vote if you knew his church had made anti-Semitic statements?' All the hot button issues on Israel.\"</p> <p>She said she will vote for Obama as planned. \"This had no influence,\" she said.</p> <p>In Key West, Florida, another swing state, Joelna Marcus, a retired professor, had a similar experience. She was asked if she would be influenced if she learned that Obama had donated money to the Palestine Liberation Organisation.</p> <p>Marcus has since disconnected her phone.</p> <p>The Huffington Post website reported that a reader named Rachel from Strongsville, Ohio, complained of a push poll that portrayed Obama as a radical left-winger who had voted to let convicted child sex offenders out early and to allow them to live near schools. </p> <p>Similar poll questions were reported by another reader on Marc Ambinder's Atlantic website.</p>",
  "<p>One of the most annoying things about straightforward \"objective\" journalism is the insistence, which, <a href=\"http://www.docstrangelove.com/2008/09/25/putin-rears-his-head/\">Putin-like, rears its head</a> with terrifying frequency, on bending over backwards to create false equivalencies for the sake of \"balance.\" For example, a reporter might be doing person-on-the-street interviews in a strongly blue or strongly red patch of territory. For the sake of balance, the reporter will usually quote two Obama supporters and two McCain supporters. Fair. Balanced. There you go.</p> <p>But what if that neck of the woods is in fact voting for one candidate or the other by something on the order of two-to-one? In that case, two and two doesn't reflect reality. It reflects straining obeisance to the gods of false equivalency. The (understandable) effort to be fair becomes an exercise in denying reality. In the interest of balance, readers are in fact given a false picture of reality. The absurdist hypothetical: \"Defenders of Mr. Hitler point to Germany's robust economic growth in the 1930s and the restoration of national pride as evidence that the Fuhrer did have several important accomplishments.\"</p> <p>All that said, here's <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTRE4911E220081002?sp=true\">a good piece of honest journalism</a> from Julie Steenhuysen of Reuters, who writes up a report from the Commonwealth Fund finding that Obama's healthcare proposal would cover far more uninsured people than McCain's would (h/t Steve Benen at <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/\">Political Animal</a>). For example:</p> <blockquote> <p>According to the report, Democrat Obama's plan would cover 34 million of the nation's projected 67 million uninsured people in 10 years, compared with just 2 million covered under Republican John McCain's plan...</p> <p>...Researchers at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center project McCain's plan would reduce the number of uninsured by 1.3 million in the first year at a cost $185 million. About 20 million people would lose their employer-sponsored coverage under McCain's plan, but 21 million would gain coverage on the individual market.</p> <p>Obama's plan in its first year would reduce the number of uninsured by 18.4 million at a cost of $86 billion.</p> <p>Over 10 years, McCain's plan would cost $1.3 trillion and Obama's would cost $1.6 trillion, according to the report.</p> <p>Neither plan would offer universal health coverage, but Obama's plan would mandate health insurance coverage for children.</p> </blockquote> <p>That's straight reporting. She doesn't say Obama will solve all the world's ills and cure cancer on the side. She merely says what the experts say to be true, that Obama's plan will cover far more people and will cost a little more over a decade and considerably more at first. There's no gas in there from campaign spinners, either, a nice relief.</p> <p>I'd like more stories like this, no matter which side they benefit.<br></p>",
  "<p>And speaking of working-class white people, how about <a href=\"http://www.wboy.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&amp;storyid=44752&amp;email=1&amp;email=1\">this rather amazing story</a>, by one Courtney Dunn from the Web site of WBOY-TV in Clarksburg, West Virginia:</p> <blockquote> <p> BLACKSVILLE -- Coal production at a mine in Monongalia County came to a halt today when every union miner stayed home, as part of a political protest.</p> <p>It was an idle day Monday at the Blacksville #2 Mine.</p> <p>More than 440 workers who are members of the United Mine Workers of America took what's called a Memorial Day instead of going to work.</p> <p>Union officials say they took the day to protest after a film crew from the National Rifle Assocation showed up at the Consol mine last week to interview union workers.</p> <p>They say the crew tried to get union coal miners to speak out against Barak Obama.</p> <p>The UMWA has endorsed the democratic presidential nominee.</p> <p>\"This was a surprise visit,\" explained VP Local 1702, Safety Chairman Eric Greathouse, \"and a lot of the miners felt this was a direct slap in the face of the union because they were trying to coerce our people into saying things against Barck Obama.\"</p> <p>\"Consol doesn't let anybody on their property - never,\" said Safety Committee Member Mark Dorsey, \"And for them to let the NRA come on the property and solicit our membership was totally uncalled for. We made our endorsement to our political process and we didn't bother them and they shouldn't be harassing our membership over this.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>My chagrin at the fact that young Dunn misspelled Obama's name not once but twice, in two different wrong ways, is doubly, trebly, pentagonally offset by the fact that this heartening act took place in the very county in which I was born and raised.</p> <p>Polls show a closer race than expected in West Virginia. I still doubt Obama can carry it, but if he at least carries the old home county I'll count it a very nice moral victory.<br></p>",
  "<p>Jonathan Martin of the Politico is reporting that the McCain campaign is <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/1008/McCain_pulling_out_of_Michigan.html?showall\">pulling out of Michigan</a>. </p> <p>This is pretty huge news. That's a battleground state with 17 electoral votes -- a big prize. If McCain isn't going to compete there, he's going to have carry all of these other battleground states: Florida, Ohio, Virginia, New Hampshire, Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada. That's assuming he can't flip any other blue states. Obviously, if he can win, say, Minnesota or especially Pennsylvania, the math changes. But Obama seems to be solidifying leads now in the blue states. McCain would have to draw an inside straight. Go <a href=\"http://www.270towin.com/\">here</a> and toggle around to see what I mean.</p> <p>Standard caveat: We're a month away and a lot can happen. But I don't really understand giving up on so important a state at this point. It must say something not only about what his team thinks his chances are there, but also about the financial state of his campaign.<br></p>",

  "<p>Getting out of our current <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">financial mess</a> requires understanding how we got into it in the first place. The fundamental cause, according to the likes of John McCain, was <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/archives/2008/09/9753_mccain_campaign_lobbyists_wall_street_aig.html\">greed and corruption on Wall Street</a>. Though not one to deny the existence of such base motives, I would insist that the crisis has its roots in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/01/economy.wall.street.subprime\">key policy decisions</a> stretching back over decades. </p> <p>In the US, there were two key decisions. The first, in the 1970s, deregulated commissions paid to stockbrokers. The second, in the 1990s, removed the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass-Steagall_Act\">Glass-Steagall Act</a>'s restrictions on mixing commercial and investment banking. In the days of fixed commissions, investment banks could make a comfortable living booking stock trades. Deregulation meant competition and thinner margins. Elimination of Glass-Steagall then allowed commercial banks to encroach on the investment banks' other traditional preserves.</p> <p>In response, investment banks branched into new businesses like originating and distributing complex derivative securities. They borrowed money and put it to work to sustain their profitability. This gave rise to the first causes of the crisis: the originate-and-distribute model of securitisation and the extensive use of leverage.</p> <p>It is important to note that these were unintended consequences of basically sensible policy decisions. Other things being equal, deregulation allowed small investors to trade stocks more cheaply, which made them better off. But other things were not equal. In particular, the fact that investment banks, which were propelled into riskier activities by these policy changes, were entirely outside the regulatory net was a recipe for disaster.</p> <p>Similarly, eliminating Glass-Steagall was fundamentally sensible. Conglomerates allow financial institutions to diversify their business, and combining with commercial banks allows investment banks to fund their operations using relatively stable deposits instead of fickle money markets. This model has proven its viability in Europe over a period of centuries, and its advantages are evident in the US even now with <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/banking/2008-09-14-merrill-lynch-bank-of-america_N.htm\">Bank of America's purchase of Merrill Lynch</a>.</p> <p>But conglomeratisation takes time. In the short run, Merrill, like the other investment banks, was allowed to double up its bets. It remained entirely outside the purview of the regulators. As a stand-alone entity, it was then vulnerable to market swings. A crisis sufficient to threaten the entire financial system was required to precipitate the inevitable conglomeratisation.</p> <p>The other element in the crisis was the set of policies that gave rise to global imbalances. The Bush administration cut taxes. The Fed cut interest rates in response to the 2001 recession. Financial innovation, meanwhile, worked to make credit even cheaper and more widely available. This, of course, is just the story of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/subprimecrisis\">subprime mortgages</a> in another guise. The result was increased US spending and the descent of measured household savings into negative territory.</p> <p>Of equal importance were the rise of China and the decline of investment in Asia following the 1997-1998 financial crisis. With China saving nearly 50% of its GNP, all that money had to go somewhere. Much of it went into US treasuries and the obligations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This propped up the dollar and reduced the cost of borrowing for US households, encouraging them to live beyond their means. It also created a more buoyant market for the securities of Freddie and Fannie, feeding the originate-and-distribute machine.</p> <p>Again, these were not outright policy mistakes. Lifting a billion Chinese out of poverty is arguably the single most important event in our lifetimes. The fact that the Fed responded quickly prevented the 2001 recession from worsening. But there were unintended consequences. The failure of US regulators to tighten capital and lending standards when abundant capital inflows combined with loose Fed policies ignited a furious credit boom. The failure of China to move more quickly to encourage higher domestic spending commensurate with its higher incomes added fuel to the fire.</p> <p>Now, a bloated financial sector is being forced to retrench. Some outcomes, like the marriage of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, are happier than others, like the bankruptcy of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers</a>. But, either way, there will be downsizing. Foreign central banks are suffering capital losses on their unthinking investments. As they absorb their losses on US Treasury and agency securities, capital flows toward the US will diminish. The US current-account deficit and the Asian surplus will shrink. US households will have to start saving again.</p> <p>The one anomaly is that the dollar has strengthened in recent weeks. With the US no longer viewed as a supplier of high-quality financial assets, one would expect the dollar to have weakened. The dollar's strength reflects the knee-jerk reaction of investors rushing into US treasuries as a safe haven. It is worth remembering that the same thing happened in August 2007, when the subprime crisis erupted. But once investors realised the extent of US financial problems, the rush into treasuries subsided, and the dollar resumed its decline. Now, as investors recall the extent of US financial problems, we will again see the dollar resume its decline.</p> <p>Emphasising greed and corruption as causes of the crisis leads to a bleak prognosis. We are not going to change human nature. We cannot make investors less greedy. But an emphasis on policy decisions suggests a more optimistic outlook. Unintended consequences cannot always be prevented. Policy mistakes may not always be avoidable. But they at least can be corrected. That, however, requires first looking more deeply into the root causes of the problem.</p>",
  "<p>There are two Roanokes: Roanoke City and Roanoke County. The city has a small market area which is just the right side of twee. Art galleries and a coffee shop, some bars, restaurants, museums a diner, stores selling knick knacks and stalls selling local produce. Only the mouse infestation in the city market building casts an unfortunate blight on an otherwise dainty, village feel. Beyond this small space the city (which is actually a county unto itself) spreads out in all directions, divided by route 581 from north to south, the railroad tracks from east to west and by race and class throughout. </p> <p>Crudely speaking, the south-east is poor and white, the south-west, affluent and white, the north-west is black, the north-east more of a mix. If there are no-go areas nobody has told me not to go there. There have been 11 murders in town this year - far more than last year but with the average range. The police have a saying here. \"If you're going to get killed in Roanoke you're going to have to work at it for a while.\"</p> <p>The county climbs up to the Catawba mountains to its north-west and the Blue Ridge Mountains as its border to the south or heads south through the valley past Valhalla vineyards. In either direction you have a staggering drive with trees pregnant with leaves, ready to give birth to a staggering autumn. Small roads that snake up mountains, spawning even smaller roads that often lead to dead ends. Houses are set back into woodland; street names like Harbor wood, Wildwood and Timberview leave little doubt about the historical preoccupations of the area. There is nothing to see here but the view.</p> <p>Topographically the difference between city and county is not stark. As you drive away from the market things get sparse, start to incline and then, 15 minutes later, you are in a different place. </p> <p>But politically and demographically it could not be more clear. The city is Democrat with a black population twice the national average. In last year's city council elections the Republicans didn't even bother putting up a candidate. In the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/VA/P/00/county.004.html#51770\">last presidential election </a>it went narrowly for Kerry 52-46. The county is Republican with a black population half the national average. In 2004 it went heavily for George Bush, 65-35. That makes the city a tiny island in <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/VA/P/00/index.html\">a sea of rural Republicanism</a>. To get to the next nearest county to vote Democrat you would have to travel three hours 45 minutes to the west and two hours to the south or north. </p> <p>Culturally and economically the city may dominate the county; geographically the county completely surrounds the city.</p> <p>In this regard, Roanoke is <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050620/nichols\">fairly typical</a>. The picture red states and blue states reasonably describes the nation's electoral map in terms of presidential politics. But for politics in general the most blatant division is not between states and regions but between the cities and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/03/usa.comment\">rural areas within them</a>. All of the 32 cities in the US with populations over 500,000 voted Democrat in 2004, even though more than half are in Republican states. On the night when anti-gay amendments were passed all over the country, Dallas in Texas elected an openly lesbian, Hispanic, Democrat as sheriff. Click on any state on <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/\">this map</a> and you need only go to the deepest blue to find the biggest city.</p> <p>If you're in a liberal in a city like Portland, Atlanta or St Louis this may not play too much with your mind. Surrounded by so many like-minded people you can afford to believe that the rest of the world has gone crazy. But in a city as small as Ronoake the fear is that those around you might not share your assumptions, rather than the other way around. </p> <p>When Terry McAuliffe came to talk on Tuesday many of the questions expressed a genuine fear that Republicans had better talking points. They kept asking how to counter Republican friends who said this or that until at one stage McAuliffe asked one of the questioners, if she had any Democratic friends. Anna Robertson, who runs the Pop's Ice Cream and Soda Bar in town, says she overheard some patrons whispering about their support for Obama at the counter until they spotted they Obama poster and then said out loud. \"Oh, it's okay. They have an Obama poster.\" What did they think was going to happen? She wasn't really sure. When you ask black voters whether whites will vote for Obama they say \"they should\". When you ask white Democrats many confess they don't know.</p> <p>This timidity, which others have also pointed out, seems strange for two reasons. First, there is far more enthusiasm for Obama than McCain in this area. In the city there are Obama yard signs all everywhere. Two weeks ago Katherine Devin held a Barack Obama Bake-a-rama sale and raised $16,000. Tonight she is holding an <a href=\"http://www.finearttoelectafineman.com/\">art sale</a> with local artists donating work. During an hour-long drive around the county I saw one yard sign and three bumper stickers. Though they love Palin, events for McCain here are few and far between. Neither the city nor the county voted for him during the primaries.</p> <p>Secondly, even if being a Democrat in Roanoke City feels rather isolating, this is nonetheless a good time to be a Democrat in Virginia. In the last three years the Republicans have lost the governorship, a Senate seat and the state senate. They are about to lose another <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14169.html\">Senate seat</a>. Most pertinently they are not only having to contest Virginia for the first time in more than 40 decades - they are now considered to be losing here for the first time <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/01/battleground.polls/?iref=mpstoryview\">since the election started </a>and and are sinking pretty much <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/\">everywhere else</a> in the country. </p> <p>The Republicans here feel anything but bullish. At a gathering of volunteers in a swanky downtown loft apartment earlier this week they were concerned about the imminent advent of socialism through Obama and the redistribution of wealth (the bail-out should take care of that by redistributing more from the poor to the rich). \"[Obama's] message of change is going to be received very well whether it should or not,\" said Josh Johnson, who was worried that voters will \"throw the baby out with the bath water\".</p> <p>But there is something in the Democratic psyche that dares not believe. It's not just about this time. And it's not just about race (although it is a large unknown factor). On some level it's about being a Democrat and feeling, mistakenly or not, that you have won the argument and lost the election. That the Republicans have some hidden weapon, dirty trick, underhand scheme to steal the show just before the curtains go up. The are haunted by the ghosts of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Harris\">Katherine Harris</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect\">Wilder</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Horton\">Willie Horton</a> all coming down the pike in Swift boats. They keep chanting \"Yes we can\" but deep down many feel: \"I wonder if we might.\"</p> <p>Additional reporting by Daniel Nasaw</p>",

Everybody's ganging up on Asif Ali Zardari, the smooth-talking new president of Pakistan, after his blatant attempts to flirt with Sarah Palin at the United Nations last week. \"You are even more gorgeous than you are on the [inaudible],\" the rakish ladies' man told Palin, according to a transcript, murmuring the final phrase of the sentence so quietly into her ear that the journalist present couldn't hear it. \"Now I know why the whole of America is crazy about you.\" (Then they vanished for a closed-door discussion; no transcript has been made public, but we can assume Zardari used the lines \"did it hurt when you fell from heaven?\" and \"you remind me of a parking ticket because you've got fine written all over you.\") Impressively, with these remarks, Zardari has managed to unite Pakistan's feminists and conservative religious leaders in outrage: one mosque leader says he's shamed the nation with \"indecent gestures, filthy remarks, and repeated praise of a non-Muslim lady wearing a short skirt,\" and has issued a fatwa, while a member of the Women's Action Forum accuses him of \"looking upon her merely as a woman and not as a politician in her own right.\" Todd Palin, meanwhile, is planning to pay a visit to Pakistan to give Zardari a piece of his mind, though since he'll be travelling exclusively by snowmobile it could be a while before he gets there.

Democratic party managers fretted that the man once dubbed \"America's first black president\" was undermining the chances of the man who they hope really will be. Saturday night comedians such as David Letterman made the estrangement a running joke.</p> <p>No more.</p> <p>Bill Clinton hit the campaign trail in Orlando, Florida, on Obama's behalf for the first time on Wednesday. It was a barnstorming performance. Obama was America's saviour, he said, because he alone understood the need to change America \"from the bottom up\".</p> <p>\"Here's why you ought to be for Barack Obama,\" <a href=\"http://cbs5.com/campaign08/bill.clinton.barack.2.830449.html\">Clinton said</a>, exhibiting a passion previously lacking. \"He's got better answers. Better answers for the economy, for energy, for healthcare, for education. He knows what it will take to get this country back on track.\"</p> <p>Clinton recalled that when he underwent heart surgery, he wanted a surgeon who knew what he was doing and how to do it. That was the case with Obama and his prescriptions for America. Go Barack!</p> <p>Even better, he eschewed all mention of McCain. Now Clinton is extending his restyled, pro-Obama \"excellent adventure\" to Ohio, Pennsylvania and Nevada.</p> <p>It is a remarkable transformation. It was as though the clouds had parted, the scales had fallen from his eyes; that he was suddenly seeing what his bitterness in his heart had refused to let him see for so long.</p> <p>It was as if Obama had taken off his spectacles, shaken out his hair, and Bill had said: Aw, gee, Barack, but you're beautiful!</p> <p>There are pedestrian reasons for this change of heart. Clinton dutifully pointed to one of them in a weekend interview. \"Hillary is the one who told me go help him (Obama). She said this guy's got real skills. She said he's got almost unlimited potential \u2026 I'm going to do my very best to do every single thing he asks me to do,\" he told NBC television at the weekend.</p> <p>Another possible key to this unlooked-for love triangle may be the Clintons' joint acceptance (and it must have been hard) that Obama is most likely going to win the presidency.</p> <p>They want a part of that. They want a share of the glory. And they want access and influence in an Obama White House.</p> <p>Perhaps, to be fair, Bill is simply doing the right thing by his party, admittedly rather belatedly. Then again, it could be that this is all some Machiavellian machination to position Hillary for another presidential run in 2012.</p> <p>Romantics will prefer a simpler explanation. Old Bubba, bless 'im, is just a sucker for a pretty face.</p>",
  "<p>After appearing to <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/25/eveningnews/main4479062.shtml\">endorse Hamas and back Barack Obama's stance on Pakistan</a> in her now infamous interview with Katie Couric, Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin has found herself embroiled in another diplomatic row over her <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1002/p04s01-wosc.html\">meeting with Pakistan's president Asif Ali Zardari</a>.</p> <p>Zardari's greeting to the Alaskan governor at their meeting at the UN headquarters in New York - described as \"overly-friendly\" by the Christian Science Monitor - has earned him a fatwa from some of Pakistan's radical Muslims. </p> <p>Benazir Bhutto's widower tells Alaska's first woman that she is <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=j5ND2FQx6WY&amp;feature=related\">\"even more gorgeous in life\"</a> and says he can see why \"America is crazy about you\". But what really got radical clerics backs up was his comment that he might hug the Moose-hunting governor if his aide insists hard enough.</p> <p>For Palin, the incident appears to have confirmed jokes that her meet-and-greet sessions with world leaders at the UN were <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=A8obsGLG0BQ\">\"speed dating\" diplomacy</a>.</p> <p>But Zardari faces much harsher condemnation for his conduct. His remarks managed to unite both hardline Islamic leaders and Pakistani feminists in condemnation. </p> <p>One radical Muslim prayer leader said the president shamed the nation with his \"indecent gestures, filthy remarks, and repeated praise of a non-Muslim lady wearing a short skirt.\" Meanwhile, Tahira Abdullah, a member of Pakistan's Women's Action Forum, criticised the president for failing to show decorum and behave like a \"mourning widower\".</p> <p>But Zardari can perhaps take comfort that not everyone is taking his flirtatious manner so seriously. Two Facebook groups have been set up to commemorate his encounter with the vice-presidential candidate. One group called <a href=\"http://www.new.facebook.com/group.php?gid=27549808259\">Zardari should marry Sarah Palin for the sake of world peace!</a>, reckons their union would \"stop the incursion of US forces in Pakistan\" and lead to polo races in the White House.</p>",

  "<p>Joe Biden and Sarah Palin tonight face off in one of the most highly anticipated vice-presidential debates in history, giving voters a chance to directly compare the hugely experienced Democratic candidate and his charismatic but untested opponent.</p> <p>The event tonight at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, is the only head-to-head debate for the vice-presidential hopefuls in the campaign.</p> <p>While Biden, who has been in the US senate since 1972, has to beware of his tendency to lapse into confusing verbosity, the event is being seen as particularly critical for Palin, the Alaska governor, whose knowledge of national and global issues has come under question in recent days.</p> <p>Biden, of Delaware, honed his craft in more than a dozen presidential debates during the Democratic primary campaign, from which he dropped out in January. Palin, meanwhile, only took office in Alaska in 2006 but proved her mettle in debates while running for that position.</p> <p>But since being selected as John McCain's running mate in late August, Palin has failed to show a full command of a number of issues during the few television interviews she has given. Biden, Barack Obama's running mate, while skilled and knowledgeable, is also prone to occasional embarrassing gaffes.</p> <p>In recent weeks the two campaigns have sought to manage expectations ahead of the debate, with both vice-presidential hopefuls praising their opponent as formidable. One liberal television commentator remarked recently that the Republican team has set expectations for Palin's performance so low that she cannot lose.</p> <p>Palin is nonetheless widely understood to have more at stake tonight. If she appears unprepared and ill-equipped to discuss major issues it could even add to the murmur of calls for her to be dumped from the Republican ticket, as well as casting doubt on McCain's judgment in selecting her. </p> <p>But if she is able successfully to parry tough questions, or wow the audience with detailed knowledge of economic and foreign policy matters, she will reignite the Republican base and could win over the small but crucial class of undecided voters. </p> <p>She has spent the last several days in \"debate camp\" on McCain's Arizona ranch, preparing and rehearsing with top McCain aides. Palin has the inbuilt advantage of being telegenic, with a natural speaking style that many voters find appealing.</p> <p>Biden, for his part, must carefully walk the thin line between showcasing his knowledge and abilities and appearing overbearing and condescending to a woman candidate. </p> <p>Tonight's forum will be moderated by Gwen Ifill, a correspondent and moderator on nationally televised public television news programmes. She is seen as a tough questioner unlikely to be caught up in trivialities. Ifill has written an upcoming book about African American politicians entitled, \"The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama\" that has some Republicans questioning her neutrality.</p> <p>The format is not as free-flowing as last week's presidential debate between McCain and Democrat Barack Obama, and is seen as favourable to Palin. It consists of 90-second answers, followed by a two-minute discussion of each question.</p> <p>Historically, vice-presidential debates have little impact on the course of the election. In 1988, for instance, the Democrat, Texas senator Lloyd Bentsen, was seen as having trounced his Republican opponent, Indiana Senator Dan Quayle. In a memorable moment still discussed today, Bentsen mocked Quayle's effort to compare himself to President John Kennedy. </p> <p>The Republican ticket, led by George Bush Sr, still won the election, although Quayle's own political individual career was effectively ended.</p>",
  "<p>What a leader, what a <a href=\"http://blogs.cqpolitics.com/beyond/2008/10/obama-makes-mccain-very-uncomf.html\">man in full</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Let the record reflect that Barack Obama made the approach to John McCain tonight.</p> <p>As the two shared the Senate floor tonight for the first time since they won their party nominations, Obama stood chatting with Democrats on his side of the aisle, and McCain stood on the Republican side of the aisle.</p> <p>So Obama crossed over into enemy territory.</p> <p>He walked over to where McCain was chatting with Republican Sen. Mel Martinez of Florida and Independent Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut. And he stretched out his arm and offered his hand to McCain.</p> <p>McCain shook it, but with a \"go away\" look that no one could miss. He tried his best not to even look at Obama.</p> <p>Finally, with a tight smile, McCain managed a greeting: \"Good to see you.\"</p> <p>Obama got the message. He shook hands with Martinez and Lieberman \u2014 both of whom greeted him more warmly \u2014 and quickly beat a retreat back to the Democratic side.</p> </blockquote> <p>What a joke. What a petulant child of a man. I do hope there's video of this.<br></p>",
  "<p>So tonight's the night. What's going to happen? Let's look at Sarah Palin, Joe Biden and moderator Gwen Ifill \u2013 now a more active than passive character in this drama \u2013 in turn.</p> <p>Palin. Let's assume she doesn't pull a classic boner for the ages that destroys her credibility in five seconds' time. I think she might, but let's say for the sake of argument that she doesn't make it that easy. What standard does she need to meet?</p> <p>The media have been saying things like, \"as long as she doesn't seem like a total idiot, she'll win.\" But I don't think that's right. I actually believe that substance matters in these forums a little more than that. One of the reasons Barack Obama beat John McCain in their first debate is that many viewers found him more substantive than they'd figured him to be. Whether they can remember specific things he said isn't the point. It's that he came across as knowledgeable. </p> <p>So put it this way if you like: command of substance is a form of performance. A candidate could not get up there and, however charismatically and empathically, read from the St. Louis telephone directory. You have to know <em>something</em>.</p> <p>So the standard she needs to meet is this: She can't seem like the student who gets up to give a book report who clearly hasn't read the book. Every American knows that type. Every American <em>was </em>that type, in one English class or another. \"Jean Valjean was this, uh, guy, who, uh, one day, and it was a nice, summer day\u2026\" People know when someone's faking it.</p> <p>In the Alaska gubernatorial debate clips I've watched, Palin was fine to good. But she was comfortable with that material, which she'd dealt with as a mayor and a state commissioner. But now, it's quite obvious that she hadn't given 10 minutes thought to national or international affairs before she was plucked. She's been studying for three weeks. </p> <p>In three weeks, how much can one learn about the credit crisis, the trade imbalance, the financing of the Social Security system, the solvency of the Medicare trust fund, the impact of WTO regulations on American manufacturers, the latest research on carbon sequestration at coal plants, the auto makers' pension problems, telecommunications policy and the lack of broadband, the path-to-citizenship question, the Syria-Lebanon situation, the India-Pakistan dispute, the Chinese connection to Africa and Latin America, the Mahdi Army, the matter of Taiwan, the concerns about military preparedness, the history of the Geneva Conventions and loose nukes?</p> <p>I've just listed 17 issues areas. I could list 117. A legitimate question could be asked in a debate about any of them. Some questions will be predictable, and Palin will be able to fall back on rehearsed boilerplate. But some won't be. And if she can't talk with some degree of, if not actual knowledge, then at least persuasively fake pseudo-knowledge about, say, India and Pakistan then she might as well have gone up on stage naked. Substance does matter. </p> <p>Joe Biden. Obviously, Biden could talk for five days straight about 117 areas of policy. Which suggests his first challenge: Don't. Keep it short.</p> <p>Aside from that, he has two main jobs. First and by far most important, don't condescend. Don't show off. There will presumably be moments when it's embarrassingly evident that she is talking gibberish. He can't smile or snicker (remember, Joe: split-screen camera). </p> <p>He must take her seriously even \u2013 especially \u2013 when she least deserves it. He can't spend the whole evening correcting her. No: \"In fact, governor, let me explain that the details of that legislation were as follows\u2026\" Yes: \"Well, if I'm remembering correctly, I think that bill was actually more directed at trying to\u2026\"</p> <p>Second: Palin will attack, attack, attack, both him and Obama. She'll be trying to goad him into being unchivalrous. Biden has to avoid the trap and fend these off forcefully but politely. Both these tasks require emotional restraint; a state of zen coolness. Biden should prepping for this debate not by rehearsing lines but by doing yoga.</p> <p>Gwen Ifill. The <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iVAeSkYI2HWjkaX11O2cv09Zf73wD93I1TVO1\">mini-controversy</a> of the last 24 hours may have the effect of forcing Ifill, one of America's best television journalists, to censor herself and strike from her question list one or two of the tougher questions she had ready for Palin.</p> <p>Ifill needs to stand her ground. In a case like this, it's the precise crafting of the questions that matters. Questions have to be phrased in just the right way so that they demand that the answerer bring some knowledge to bear on the issue, while at the same time they don't cross the line into being too clever by half. Also they can't be too open-ended, because open-ended questions just let the person fling b.s. around.</p> <p>Too open-ended: \"Governor, give us your thoughts on telecommunications policy and how to expand broadband.\"</p> <p>Too clever: \"Governor, expound if you will on the comparative merits of the broadband policies of the United States, South Korea, Taiwan and Estonia.\"</p> <p>Just right: \"Governor, many people think the 1996 telecommunications act hasn't fostered broadband growth at a rate that it could have. What changes would you recommend to that act?\"</p> <p>That's a fair question. It doesn't demand that she be an expert on policy, but it does fairly demand that she know a little something about one of the most important pieces of legislation passed in the 1990s and have some basic ideas about the issue. </p> <p>The other thing Ifill shouldn't do is give Palin opportunities to correct some of the idiotic things she's said over the last few days. In a new Katie Couric segment released yesterday, Palin affirmed that she saw a right to privacy in the Constitution. That's a dreadful error from the perspective of the so-called pro-life movement. Ifill shouldn't just ask her something like, \"Do you want to clarify your views on privacy and the Constitution?\" She'll have been coached for that. </p> <p>Assuming there are no big historic moments, I suspect that this debate won't end up mattering that much. Most Americans think John McCain made an irresponsible choice, and most Americans will still think that the morning after election day.</p>",

  "<p>In recent weeks, liberals and conservatives alike have been warning the Republic party - and Sarah Palin herself - that their vice-presidential candidate is woefully incapable of serving in the White House. Take <a href=\"http://article.nationalreview.com/print/?q=MDZiMDhjYTU1NmI5Y2MwZjg2MWNiMWMyYTUxZDkwNTE=\">Kathleen Parker</a>, for example, writing in the National Review:</p> <blockquote> <p>Palin's recent interviews with Charles Gibson, Sean Hannity, and now Katie Couric have all revealed an attractive, earnest, confident candidate. Who Is Clearly Out Of Her League. \u2026 Only Palin can save McCain, her party and the country she loves. She can bow out for personal reasons, perhaps because she wants to spend more time with her newborn. No one would criticise a mother who puts her family first. Do it for your country.</p> </blockquote> <p>The main reason she is inadequate is her stunning lack of knowledge about the issues that anyone in her position should know about, most prominently foreign policy. The few news anchors the McCain team has allowed her to speak with - Gibson, Hannity and Couric - could all clearly dance circles around the wannabe Veep when it comes to international politics. But Palin is also alarmingly unskilled when it comes to a more indigenous matter: speaking the English language. Or, as I wouldn't be too surprised to hear her put it, talking American.</p> <p>The petrified McCain team has, wisely, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/29/sarah.palin.media.debate\">barely permitted Palin to speak in public</a>. They are so worried about her oratorical ineptitude, in fact, that they successfully negotiated to limit the amount of time she could be interrogated on a single topic during tonight's vice-presidential debate. Now, each candidate will have just 90 seconds to answer a question, followed by a two-minute discussion period.<br> The few times Palin has spoken at length, with the exception of her heavily rehearsed performance at the Republican national convention, she has revealed both her limited vocabulary and how difficult it is for her to utter complete, complex sentences.</p> <p>I began to notice the problem during <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/Story?id=5782924&amp;page=2\">Palin's interview with Charlie Gibson</a> - not coincidentally, her first major unscripted foray into the public speaking realm. When Gibson asked her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/12/sarahpalin.uselections2008\">whether she agreed with the Bush doctrine</a> - and then had to explain to her what it was \u2013 she replied: \"If there is legitimate and enough intelligence that tells us that a strike is imminent against American people, we have every right to defend our country.\" Even to the untrained ear that sentence sounds awkward. \"Legitimate and enough\"? It can't possibly be elitist to suggest that \"legitimate and sufficient\" would have come off as more literate.</p> <p>At another point, Gibson asked Palin whether it took hubris for her to jump so quickly and unquestioningly at McCain's offer to run with him. The halting way she answered made me wonder whether she knew what the word hubris actually meant: \"I - I answered him yes because I have the confidence in that readiness and knowing that you can't blink.\" Even if we give her the benefit of the doubt and assume that she does know what hubris is, her sentence barely makes sense. What does it mean that she has \"confidence in ... knowing that you can't blink\"?</p> <p>Another way that Palin has revealed her limited linguistic skills is through her repetition of certain words or phrases. As <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/opinion/25Cohen.html?em\">Roger Cohen pointed out</a> recently in the New York Times, she \"loves the word 'exceptional.' At a rally in Nevada the other day, the Republican vice-presidential candidate said: 'We are an exceptional nation.' Then she declared: 'America is an exceptional country.' In case anyone missed that, she added: 'You are all exceptional Americans.'\" And as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/us/politics/01palin.html\">Kathleen Seeyle has reported</a> about Palin's past debate performances:</p> <blockquote> <p>Her sentences were distinguished by their repetition of words, by the use of the phrase \"here in Alaska\" and for gaps. On paper, her sentences would have been difficult to diagram. John Bitney, the policy director for her campaign for governor and the main person who helped prepare her for debates, said her repetition of words was \"her way of running down the clock as her mind searches for where she wants to go.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>Andrew Halcro, however, who ran against Palin in the Alaska gubernatorial race, was perfectly succinct when he called one of her debate answers during that campaign \"political gibberish\".</p> <p>Perhaps the most painful verbal moment for Palin came during <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/25/eveningnews/main4479062.shtml?source=RSSattr=HOME_4479062\">her appearance on Couric's show</a> when the newswoman asked Palin to explain what she'd meant when she cited Alaska's proximity to Russia as proof that she has foreign policy experience. Palin responded: \"[I meant] that Alaska has a very narrow maritime border between a foreign country, Russia, and on our other side, the land - boundary that we have with - Canada.\" Never mind that you can't have a border between countries - countries either border each other, or they share a border.</p> <p>Far more worrisome was Palin's next sentence, which she was unable to complete: \"It's funny that a comment like that was kind of made to - cari - I don't know, you know?\" It seemed as though Palin stopped herself because she'd been considering using the word \"caricature\", but was afraid she'd do so incorrectly. She ended her spluttering by sighing: \"Reporters.\" Kind of the way a redneck might say: \"Women. Can't live with 'em, can't kill 'em!\"</p> <p>Couric suggested to Palin that the word she'd been searching for was \"mocked\". Palin, who managed to come off as both exhausted from the effort of trying to translate her thoughts into words and yet still belligerent, responded by saying: \"Yeah, mocked. I guess that's the word. Yeah.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/opinion/27herbert.html\">Bob Herbert commented</a> on the exchange in an op-ed for the New York Times: \"It is not just painful, but frightening to watch someone who could become the vice-president of the United States stumbling around like this in an interview.\" Herbert was focused mainly on Palin's lack of readiness to lead the country, rather than her basic linguistic inadequacies. But the two go together. I would guess they stem from her lack of intellectual curiosity and her concomitant arrogance.</p> <p>I could go on and on. I could mention the time when she mentioned \"predator\" lenders, rather than predatory lenders, to Couric. But you get the point. </p> <p>I have to wonder whether Palin, who is being touted by Republican leaders as an anti-elitist, knows the definition of \"elitism\":</p> <blockquote> <p>1. The belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority, as in intellect, social status, or financial resources.</p> <p>2. a. The sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group or class.<br>b. Control, rule or domination by such a group or class.</p> </blockquote> <p>Funny that a so-called anti-elitist is woman who rewards members of her inner circle and old high-school friends with plum appointments; who is a member of the party that has been ruling the White House for eight years; who seems so haughty about her right to run for the vice-presidency that she makes no effort to hide her exasperation with members of the media who are trying to assess whether she is prepared for the job.</p> <p>Oh, and hubris? Yeah, that's excessive pride or self-confidence, which often leads to the kind of vaulting ambition that led to Macbeth's downfall. </p> <p>I, for one, hope it leads to Palin's before she drags the rest of the country down with her.</p>",
  "<p>\"Step up to the plate and let's do what's right,\" Barack Obama told his fellow lawmakers yesterday, ahead of last night's Senate vote on the revised version of the government's bailout plan, which passed by 74 votes to 25. John McCain, who like Obama, altered his campaigning schedule to return to Washington, expressed the same sentiments, calling on Congress to act with \"the unity that crisis demands\". The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill tomorrow. But campaigning didn't really stop at all: although McCain spoke directly to the camera in a new TV ad, bemoaning the way that Democrats and Republicans were blaming each other for the crisis, his surrogate Rudy Giuliani did exactly that in a conference call with reporters.</p> <p>The focus now moves to St Louis, Missouri, where Sarah Palin goes head-to-head with Joe Biden tonight in what is surely the most closely watched vice-presidential debate in recent memory. Expectations for Palin's performance couldn't be much lower, after a sequence of embarrassing responses to questions from Katie Couric on CBS - but traditionally, of course, low expectations are a boon for a candidate heading into an event such as this. The Democrats, meanwhile, have been seeking to heighten expectations of the Alaska governor, aided by a flurry of news stories over the last couple of days suggesting Palin is a better debater than many might imagine. The gaffe-prone Biden is a source of nervousness to Democrats, too: the tiniest sign of condescension towards Palin could prove disastrous. But there's no question of which campaign goes into tonight's face-off with the most to prove. </p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>There's only one thing to watch, of course: the showdown between Mr Amtrak and the moosehunter. I'll be liveblogging it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog\">here</a>.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>A slight narrowing in Gallup's daily tracking poll: Obama 48%, McCain 44%. Meanwhile, Obama showed significant improvements in a raft of battleground state polls, leading 51% to 43% in Florida, according to a Quinnipiac state poll which put him seven points behind three weeks ago. A CNN poll found gains for Obama in five crucial battleground states - Florida, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada and Virginia.</p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"People need to see a gladiator who's willing to defend what exactly he stands for.\" Tennessee Republican chairman Robin Smith, one of several party figures sounding panicked at what former McCain aide Mike Murphy called a \"stunning lack of competence\" in the campaign. </p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/02/uselections.new.mexico\">Video: 'The Hispanic voter is an emotional voter'</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/02/uselections2008.johnmccain\">Anxious party tells McCain to fight harder</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/01/uselections2008.virginia\">Former DNC chairman says attack ads against Obama will get nastier</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/02/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">Tomasky Talk: Palin v Biden</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/oct/01/johnmccain.sarahpalin\">Oliver Burkeman: And now for some relaxing music</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1002/p04s01-wosc.html\">Christian Science Monitor: Flirting with Palin earns Pakistani president a fatwa</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/02/us/politics/02issues.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin\">NYT: As Governor, Palin Has Focused on Developing State's Resources</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/10/01/palins-interview-with-couric-grabs-more-headlines/\">WSJ: Palin's Interview With Couric Grabs More Headlines</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/221299.php\">Talking Points Memo: Sarah's Greatest Hits!</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/hendrikhertzberg/2008/10/interoffice-mem-1.html\">New Yorker: Interoffice Memo</a></p> <h2>Property of the day</h2> <p>Buy John and Cindy McCain's <a href=\"http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2008/09/ok_so_after_todays_financial.php\">old mansion</a> in Phoenix, Arizona! \"This gracious, private residence is gated and secure on a sprawling 2.7 acre estate lot.

  "<p>I see John Denham* has taken time out from the global financial crisis to take a poke at Chris Patten, the chancellor of Oxford University and sometime Tory grandee, for saying the current \u00a33,149 cap on student tuition fees is far too low.</p> <p>\"Can there be middle class objection to higher fees?\" if government funding and private donations on a US scale lag behind the needs of a university system determined to stay in the big league, Patten asked.</p> <p>It seemed a reasonable question to me. But it immediately got mixed up in a wider controversy about standards and the extent to which ministerial pressure to ensure poor students get their share of Oxbridge is in conflict with excellence, the \"wider participation\" debate.</p> <p>Denham, who is a thoughtful man, accused Patten of having an \"outmoded\" view of the world and of seeking to preserve his university (he is actually chancellor at Newcastle too) for a socially elite intake. Patten is part of the \"more means worse brigade\" he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/oct/02/oxforduniversity.tuitionfees\">told the Guardian's Polly Curtis</a>.</p> <p>Who's right then? I fear Patten is more right than Denham, though both have useful points to make. Denham has \u2013 like Gordon Brown in the Laura Spence affair in 2000 - got hold of the wrong end of the stick. It's easy to see why.</p> <p>Denham is a Southampton comprehensive boy who read chemistry. He came up the hard-ish way.</p> <p>But Patten was not a Brideshead elitist either. His father was, as I recall, something exotic and faintly disreputable (a jazz musician?) and he attended a modest private Catholic school \u2013 St Benedict's \u2013 in west London. He's the type to win scholarships. He got to Balliol College Oxford on brains, not connections.</p> <p>So in their different ways, both men are the products of an elitism that opens careers to talent. Both would agree that's what a modern country needs \u2013 we can't afford to exclude the working class, ethnic minorities or women, as both recent party conferences went out of their way to stress.</p> <p>But how best to do it? Labour ministers are right to protest that kids with potential \u2013 key word \u2013 who attend poor schools need to be rescued, sometimes by turning a blind eye to weaker grades. That's fine and snobby admissions tutors (plenty of stories about them) doubtless need the occasional kick in the arse. But they admit to struggling to meet government targets \u2013 social engineering as the vice-chancellor at Cambridge recently called it.</p> <p>There's a familiar irony here. When elite universities and public school graduates accuse Labour of \"social engineering\" they can't see what is blindingly obvious to most people; that Eton is a form of social engineering too, and a very successful model. But the idea that the 7% they educate are the country's cleverest kids - you hear that one too \u2013 is self-regarding nonsense.</p> <p>Schools like Eton attract brilliant pupils, but also Beta Minus types whom good teaching can turn into Alpha Minus applicants to Oxbridge and other Russell Group elite universities, C-Minus into B-Minus etc. That's what they're for, that's what dad pays for. </p> <p>Few jobs now exist in the City for mere well-connected dunderheads: the current financial crisis was caused by some of the cleverest idiots from all over the world. But that's another story.</p> <p>Where Labour goes wrong, time and time again, is by not ensuring that state schools can deliver clever children to the Russell Group applications market suitably prepared for what are very rigorous courses: they push the kids hard at Oxbridge colleges, harder than in most places, so I observed watching my children's generation grow up.</p> <p>How best to do it? Much easier for the postwar grammar school generation \u2013 people like me, Patten's age - when 7% to 8% of young people went to university. Rapid expansion in the 1960s, the Tory promotion of polys to university status - fine by me \u2013 and Labour's more recent expansions are now pushing the figure past 40% and rising.</p> <p>Whether the majority of 18-year-olds benefit from a university education, I personally doubt and once asked Tony Blair (Fettes and Oxford) who looked puzzled and accused me of elitism. Better status for vocational training of a high level \u2013 what Ed Balls is again attempting \u2013 seems a wiser option, the German model. But better education and tough exams for pupils too, at academies or bog standards.</p> <p>What Patten was saying, if I understand him, is that many university courses cost a lot and that, with 50% attending, the taxpayer can't pick up the whole bill, as it did for much of my education in the 50s and 60s. Who pays? Patten says the middle class \u2013 as they do in America \u2013 should pay more for the benefits their offspring's education may well yield (no guarantees there).</p> <p>That seems reasonable to me, even in a credit crunch. Why should working class taxpayers subsidise the future elite \u2013 not to mention the Bullingdon Club crowd \u2013 for benefits they will not directly share? There is a gender issue lurking here too.</p> <p>As brainy David Willetts, a Brummie elite grammar school boy, said in a speech at the Tory conference fringe, most of the extra places in recent years have been taken by middle class women, creating a Bridget Jones marriage market: too few equally educated men for them to marry. Why so? Some 45% of young women now graduate against 35% of young men.</p> <p>Labour doesn't seem to mind that because gender is part of its progressive tick box mentality, as in ethnicity. But class is a factor too and the ex-Trot in John Denham bravely rises to the challenge. </p> <p>What he \u2013 and Patten - need to do is to ensure that there's enough money built up in the system (outside Oxbridge it will take time) to provide scholarships and bursaries to the clever poor with the right aptitude and ambition.</p> <p>That's what Harvard does, shamelessly shaking down its alumni for gifts and legacies (it lets their kids in too as part of the deal) so it can finance clever black kids, kids like Barack Obama, come to think of it. </p> <p>I tried to explain that to Gordon Brown in 2000 when the then-chancellor jumped on the Laura Spence (why did snooty Oxford turn her down?) bandwagon when he rang me to make his case against \"the establishment\" for not offering her a place (they went to equally deserving applicants). He hasn't rung back. </p> <p>All Brown's biographers note how distressed he was in his own grammar school fast stream, en route from the clergyman's booked-lined home to elite Edinburgh University at just 16 while friends fell behind. Good for him, but guilt is no substitute for clear-eyed policies to put matters to right.</p> <p><strong>12.25pm, correction: </strong> My apologies for confusing John Denham with John Hutton as business secretary when he is actually secretary for innovations, universities and skills; a mistake I have previously made.</p> <p>I was also wrong to suggests that Denham was a Trotskyite supporter in his younger days. Rechecking with Andrew Roth's authoritative guide to MPs' backgrounds I find he was an active opponent of the Militant Tendency in his student days. </p> <p>These corrections have now been made to this blogpost</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338188219\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>The US Senate voted comfortably in favour of the Bush administration's contentious $700bn bail-out of the banking industry early this morning, bringing the package back to life after a bitter week of political wrangling and wild gyrations in financial markets.</p> <p>After a six-hour debate, the emergency rescue plan was passed by 74 to 25. The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, said: \"I'm very, very happy. This is a good vote.\"</p> <p>The bill is expected to go back to the House of Representatives tomorrow, where Republican and Democratic leaders hope to reverse Monday's shock vote against its progress.</p> <p>The upper chamber's approval will come as a relief to George Bush whose authority has been severely tested by Congress's rebellion. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketturmoil\">Global financial markets have been volatile </a>throughout the week and financial institutions have been struggling to stay afloat on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>The two candidates vying for the US presidency, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>, both broke off the campaign trail to cast their first votes in the chamber for months.</p> <p>\"This plan is not perfect. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democrats</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans\">Republicans</a> in Congress have legitimate concerns about it,\" Obama told his fellow senators. \"But it's clear from my perspective that this is what we have to do right now to prevent the possibility of a crisis turning into a catastrophe.\" </p> <p>Since it was rejected by the House earlier in the week, the plan has been sweetened with measures to appease doubters. The core proposal still authorises the treasury to spend billions of dollars cleaning up the balance sheets of struggling banks by buying up moribund mortgage-related securities. But it has grown from its original three pages to 451 pages.</p> <p>In its new form, the plan will increase protection for US bank customers by raising the limit of a federal guarantee on deposit accounts from $100,000 to $250,000. </p> <p>Another amendment extends energy-related tax breaks for businesses - a measure intended to win over Republican free-market critics but which has rankled some on the left who see it as a nod to commerce rather than to struggling homeowners.</p> <p>There are still staunch hold-outs in both parties. Bill Nelson, a Democratic senator from Florida, argued that it hardly does anything to help those facing foreclosure on predatory sub-prime mortgages.</p> <p>\"This bill sends a message to Wall Street that if you play fast and loose in the name of short-term profits, the government will make up your losses,\" said Nelson.</p> <p>But Lindsay Graham, a Republican, argued that the alternative was to allow credit to become so expensive that \"Americans are not going to be able to borrow a dime\". He said: \"If you think this costs a lot now, just do nothing and then see what it costs.\"</p> <p>Many Congressional figures say they have detected a change in the mood of constituents towards grudging acceptance of the bailout, partly prompted by this week's plunge in Wall Street stock prices. A long-time critic of the plan, Republican senator Joe Barton of Texas, said the balance of calls to his office from voters had shifted from 60-40 opposed to the package to 70-30 in favour of it.</p> <p>A glut of dismal economic statistics has given fresh impetus for action. New data yesterday showed a slump in manufacturing activity, a dive in car sales and soaring job losses.</p> <p>The world's richest man, Warren Buffett, has likened the situation to an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/sep/25/banking.wallstreet1\">\"economic Pearl Harbour\"</a>. Some 14 high-street banks in the US have already gone bust this year and investment houses Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns have fallen victim to the crisis. </p> <p>But on the streets outside Congress, noisy protesters demonstrated against the bailout. <a href=\"http://www.jwj.org/\">Jobs With Justice</a>, a workers' rights group, held rallies outside Washington branches of Bank of America and Citibank. Sarcastically dubbing themselves \"billionaires for the bailout\", they chanted: \"We broke it, you fix it.\"</p>"
