  "<p>\"It has not been possible to reduce poverty and I feel sad about it,\" said Zambia's president, Levy Mwanawasa, in 2005. He compounded his outbreak of honesty by admitting that \"unfortunately, if Zambians made a mistake to elect me as president, they are stuck with me\". But they did not make a mistake and sadly they were not stuck with him. The president, who should have turned 60 today, will instead be buried in Lusaka following his death last month. He was one of Africa's decent politicians, a reminder that not every leader on the continent lapses into the insanity of a Mugabe or an Amin. He came to prominence in 1989 as a lawyer, successfully defending a former vice-president against treason charges and a possible death sentence. That defiance of Zambia's founding father, Kenneth Kaunda, and a car crash two years later which nearly killed him, did not prevent him becoming first vice-president - he resigned in 1994 in protest at corruption - and then, after a disputed election in 2001, president. In that job he reduced national debt, took on corruption and - helped by rising copper prices - oversaw an economic recovery. That did not do much to help many poor Zambians, as he admitted, and nor was he a perfect democrat - once threatening to charge an opposition rival with treason. But it was better than Zimbabwe managed. President Mwanawasa's last act was to speak out against that country's disastrous decline, and denounce its leader. His death may help Mugabe - and harm Africa.</p>",
  "<p>A race that began as the West Wing now looks alarmingly like Desperate Housewives. Six months ago, you couldn't help but notice the striking similarity between Barack Obama and Matthew Santos, the fictional but charismatic ethnic minority candidate who promised to heal America's divide. Now, you can't help but feel you're watching an especially lurid episode from Wisteria Lane, as the real-life Sarah Palin fends off rumours of a fake pregnancy - and the accusation that her son is actually her grandson - by revealing that her unmarried 17-year-old daughter is expecting a baby and will soon marry the father, a young hockey player. Meanwhile, Palin has hired a lawyer to beat back a state investigation into claims that she abused the power of her office to remove her sister's ex-husband from his job as a state trooper, a man who has admitted tasering his own 10-year-old stepson! Would even America's trashiest daytime soaps dare squeeze that much action into just the first four days of a new storyline?</p> <p>The McCain campaign has done it, thereby achieving in an instant one of its key objectives. At last people are talking about the Republicans, after months in which all the excitement had been on the other side. Ever since McCain introduced Palin to a stunned, unprepared political world last Friday, Obama has barely had a look-in. From conservative talk radio to celebrity gossip websites, there is only one topic: it's all Palin, all the time.</p> <p>In these reams of commentary, there is uncertainty about the only question that really matters: how will this saga, and Palin herself, play in the November election? Ultimately, will she hurt or hinder John McCain?</p> <p>If it's hard to tell, that's because almost every new nugget we discover about Governor Palin can be viewed in radically opposite lights. The \"family values\" brigade might be shocked by the admission of premarital sex in the Palin clan; or it might be heartened that young Bristol - even the names sound like they come from a TV soap - has chosen to carry her baby to term and marry the father. So far, the latter reaction seems to have prevailed, with the Christian right, already smitten by Palin's anti-abortion, pro-guns, anti-gay marriage stances, standing by its woman. Some McCain backers have even tried to turn the episode into a net positive: talkshow host Michael Graham wrote yesterday that Palin, with one son off to Iraq, another with Down's syndrome and now a daughter set to become a teenage mom, had undergone experiences that millions of American women could relate to: \"Sarah Palin is as accessible as Obama is exotic.\" </p> <p>Or take what was, until the soap suds started lathering up, Palin's most obvious weakness: her inexperience. To political veterans, it's ludicrous to propose that a 20-month governor of a state with a population of under 700,000 is ready to take over as president (not such a remote possibility, given that John McCain is 72 and has a history of cancer). They note that when Palin visited Kuwait last year, she reportedly had to apply for a passport: she had never travelled outside North America before. How could she possibly be ready to lead the world's greatest military power? </p> <p>But Democrats who make these points risk doing the Republicans' work for them, falling into the wearily familiar trap of sounding like condescending coastal elitists, who look down their noses at ordinary Americans like the Palins. The blue-collar Republican base is already wild for the governor: every time they see a New York talking head say how absurd her candidacy is, they'll like her even more. </p> <p>Besides, the McCain camp is already hard at work spinning that all this inexperience is a good thing. It means, they say, that Palin will be a \"breath of fresh Alaska air\" in stale Washington, an outsider who had already dared take on politics-as-usual in her own state. Viewed that way, Palin has restored to McCain what always used to be his USP: his status as the reformer, fearlessly standing against the machine. </p> <p>So she will go into the vice-presidential TV debate against the seasoned senator and foreign policy sage Joe Biden cushioned by subterraneanly low expectations. If she manages to utter several coherent sentences in a row, it will be declared a draw. If he so much as looks patronising or if he does an Al Gore-style sigh of impatience, she will be declared the winner. He's a bruiser who would have been eager to crush any male opponent. Now he'll be holding himself back lest he looks like a sexist pig. </p> <p>There are some straightforward negatives for Palin that are not susceptible to even the most energetic spin. It's not good that she turns out to have been for the notorious \"bridge to nowhere\" - a $400m project in Alaska that has come to symbolise wasteful, \"pork-barrel\" spending - before she was against it. It dents her image as a reformer and shows she flip-flops as much as any other politician. Not helpful, either, that in the 1990s she was a member of the Alaskan Independence party, which seeks a referendum on breaking away from the US. The firing of her brother-in-law, and the outstanding request that she give a deposition on the matter, under oath, will linger through the campaign. And the fact that the McCain camp seems to have started seriously vetting Palin after nominating her, only now sending lawyers and researchers to Alaska, reflects especially badly on McCain himself. (He met her properly for the first time last week, according to the New York Times.) It suggests the downside of all that maverick brio is a recklessness that is hardly suitable in a commander-in-chief. </p> <p>What no one can know is whether that cost will be outweighed by the gains Palin brings, galvanising a socially conservative base that had been previously lukewarm towards McCain. What we can know already is that this election will share a depressing feature with the contests of the past 40 years: that America will plunge again into the never-ending culture wars. </p> <p>For Palin cannot help but polarise the electorate. Everything that liberal, blue-state America can't stand about her makes conservative, red-state America swoon. It's not just about \"Jesus babies and guns,\" as Rush Limbaugh pithily put it. Palin also wants \"intelligent design\" - creationism - taught in school. When she was mayor of the small town of Wasilla, \"she asked the library how she could go about banning books,\" according to a local official quoted by Time. Palin was worried about \"inappropriate\" language. \"The librarian was aghast\" - and was later threatened with the sack. </p> <p>In his stirring speech last week, Obama urged America not to \"make a big election about small things\". Yet here we are, discussing not Sarah Palin's record or programme but Jesus, guns, and as one feminist blogger put it yesterday, \"the uterine activity of her family\". This is a setback for women, especially in a year that seemed to promise a breakthrough, but it is also a setback for America itself. </p> <p>Obama made his name four years ago with a speech that called for an end to the civil war of red against blue. In 2008, he urged a different kind of election, one that would match the gravity of the hour. But the naming of Sarah Palin, and the reaction it has provoked, has dashed that hope. Americans are, once again, fighting over the questions that politics can never really settle - faith, sexuality - and pushing aside the ones that it can. And which it must. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:freedland@theguardian.com\">freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>\"Dude! This kind of thing does not happen in St Paul,\" one woman exclaimed, as we briefly took shelter from a passing crowd of angry protesters in the city centre. One had smashed a window in Macy's while others had knocked the glass from a nearby police car. She was right: the trademark temperament of the residents of the city and its surroundings is known as Minnesota Nice, and it doesn't usually extend to loud protests, let alone violent ones. (By the end of the day, 300 arrests had been made, though police were accused of overreacting.) </p> <p>Minnesota Nice is all about non-confrontation: one local protester's banner read \"Stop torturing people, you freaks\", which sounded almost friendly. </p> <p>The correct Minnesota way to respond when 20 balaclava-wearing activists stride past yelling anti-Bush slogans, by the way, is with a slight raising of the eyebrows and the phrase \"That's different,\" which it certainly was.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Several more items of evidence point to St Paul's deeply ambivalent feelings towards the blazer-and-chinos-wearing Republican hordes who've descended on the city to party - or, to put it another way, to hold a series of sombre fundraisers for hurricane-torn states while thoughtfully sipping a cocktail, or two, or nine, and then passing out. </p> <p>Exhibit A: an investigation by the Washington publication Roll Call, which finds that residents of the Twin Cities have donated overwhelmingly more money to Barack Obama's campaign than to John McCain's. Exhibit B: non-partisan T-shirts for sale in stores in St Paul, carrying the slogan \"Vote\", or \"Friends don't let friends vote [insert party name here]\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> What a relief, then, to come across a \"Dress Up Little Liberal\" cut-out doll. It features an effete-looking man in underpants, who can be adorned with \"clogs made from recycled car tyres\", a \"bleeding heart\", and a banner reading \"Abolish the fourth of July.\" He can also be placed upon a cardboard soapbox, \"for periodic rants\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The McCain campaign did everything it could to mock Barack Obama's European tour, where assorted communists, hippies and foreigners turned out in their thousands to hear him speak in Berlin. But the Republican has his own Euro-following now - Spain for McCain, a support group that is offering fans the opportunity to pose for photographs in Madrid beside a life-size cardboard cutout of the candidate. Not quite as sensational a 70,000-strong rally, perhaps, but then we must show respect for the victims of Hurricane Gustav.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If common decency will not prevent the tabloid media from digging into the personal lives of Bristol Palin and her boyfriend, the father of her child, perhaps these excerpts from the boyfriend's Myspace page will do the trick instead. \"I'm a fuckin' redneck who likes to snowboard and ride dirt bikes,\" he explains. \"I like to go camping and hang out with the boys, do some fishing, shoot some shit and just fuckin' chillin' I guess ... Ya fuck with me, I'll kick your ass.\" Martin Bashir, you have been warned.</p>",
  "<p>The Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, sought to put his party convention back on track yesterday after losing most of the first day because of Hurricane Gustav.</p> <p>George Bush, who had been due to make the primetime speech to the convention on Monday, was scheduled to address delegates last night by video from the White House. But the president was relegated to a minor role, taken off the primetime slot and his speech cut from 15 minutes to six. Some other events planned for Monday were ditched altogether.</p> <p>The primetime speakers scheduled for last night were not Bush but Fred Thompson, the former Law and Order actor who ran for the nomination against McCain, and Joe Lieberman, the former Democrat and now an independent who is a close friend of McCain.</p> <p>The reduced role for Bush suits McCain. While the president remains popular with most Republicans, according to polls, he is unpopular in the country at large, and McCain is keen to keep his distance.</p> <p>In excerpts of Bush's comments, published in advance, he focuses on McCain's potential as commander-in-chief. \"We live in a dangerous world. And we need a president who understands the lessons of September 11 2001: that to protect America, we must stay on the offence, stop attacks before they happen, and not wait to be hit again.\"</p> <p>But Bush also had an eye on his own legacy. He took the credit for the surge of US troops to Iraq that he claims has reduced violence, even though McCain advocated such a policy well before Bush. Instead, he confined himself to praising McCain for supporting the surge from the Senate.</p> <p>The job of both Thompson and Lieberman was to fill out McCain's biography, just as Michelle Obama and others did for Barack Obama last week at the start of the Democratic convention in Denver.</p> <p>In excerpts released in advance, Thompson was gushing, describing McCain as \"the kind of character that civilisations from the beginning of history have sought in their leaders\", who would \"restore integrity to our government\" - seemingly oblivious to the fact it has been in Republican hands for the last eight years.</p> <p>McCain cancelled the first day of the convention while the Gulf coast was struck by the hurricane, and he headed to the region. But, with New Orleans having escaped the devastation wrought by Katrina in 2005, he was anxious for the convention to fully resume, and to secure primetime TV audiences. Only a third of the delegates turned up on Monday for two hours of procedural business and a brief appearance by Laura Bush and McCain's wife, Cindy, both appealing for funds for victims of the hurricane.</p> <p>The normal bustle was expected to start last night, though organisers said they wanted the tone to stay subdued, and there would be little in the way of attacks on Obama.</p> <p>The convention organisers said they had not yet finalised the programme for today and tomorrow, both of which have also had to be rewritten, but confirmed McCain would deliver his speech accepting the nomination in person and not by satellite, the back-up plan if Hurricane Gustav had proved catastrophic and he had remained in the region.</p> <p>The rollcall of delegates to formally nominate McCain is to be held tonight.</p> <p>With McCain and Obama virtually level in the polls and Obama having received no or only a slight poll rise from the convention, McCain is hoping he will get the bounce where Obama failed.</p> <p>Almost all of yesterday was devoted to the schmaltz that seems to appeal to US audiences: hour after hour of sentimental details about McCain's life, from Cindy's adoption of a Bangladeshi child, to a former Vietnam prisoner of war describing their time together in jail in Hanoi.</p> <p>Thompson was to talk about \"the courage and essence\" of McCain, while Lieberman spoke of him as \"the original maverick\" with a history of bucking the Republican line, part of the reason he is viewed with suspicion by many delegates.</p> <p>McCain is hoping Lieberman will help win over independents who want to see a more bipartisan approach in Washington.</p>",
  "<p>Mike Huckabee knows about dealing with obesity. The former presidential candidate lost 50kg (110lbs) while he was governor of Arkansas. He made tackling weight problems a key plank of his time in office, fighting the traditional southern diet of fried food.</p> <p>He is now full of dire warnings about the obesity epidemic gripping America. \"In another generation kids as young as 16 will drop dead at their desks in high school from heart attacks as a result of this crisis,\" he said.</p> <p>Huckabee, was speaking at an obesity forum at the Republican national convention that, for the first time ever, will now include addressing obesity as part of its platform, or political manifesto. A similar motion was also included in the Democratic platform in Denver last week.</p> <p>In the stately surroundings of a downtown St Paul library, Republican politicians, delegates and health experts gathered to discuss the simple fact that Americans are fatter and eating more than ever before. Breakfast was served to delegates - yoghurt, low-fat bagels and fresh fruit. Huckabee joked about once having a healthy disrespect for jogging. \"I thought it was crazy to run. That was why God gave us cars,\" he joked.</p> <p>Obesity statistics alone spell out the remarkable scale of the problem. From 1960 to 2004 the proportion of obese adults in America went from 13% to 32%. It will rise to more than 50% by 2030. It has led to huge problems with heart disease, diabetes and other health issues. By 2030, on current trends, obesity-related healthcare spending could be nearly $1tn. </p> <p>Politicians from both sides have little trouble agreeing on the scale of the epidemic or its causes. </p> <p>Many medical experts believe the modern economy and office-based lifestyle is taking its toll on human bodies genetically hard-wired to store fat as a survival mechanism. In effect, human biology designed to eke out a hunter-gatherer existence on the African savannah is failing to cope with the mass production of cheap junk food and the decline in jobs requiring physical labour. </p> <p>\"We have an abundance of foods high in calories and we don't do the exercise we used to aeons ago,\" said Caroline Apovian, a board member of the Obesity Society, which hosted the debate. She added that obesity should be classed as a disease, with some people more genetically susceptible to its harmful impact than others. \"We call this an epidemic. We know now that obesity is not just a matter of willpower,\" she said.</p> <p>However, little concrete policy emerged from the politicians at the debate. Tommy Thompson, a former heath secretary sent to the debate by the McCain campaign, gave a speech about the need for action on obesity, but refused to commit the campaign to giving extra money to schools so that they could afford to serve healthier meals rather than junk food. \"I would be for it,\" Thompson said. \"I don't know if John McCain would be. Budgets are tough things.\"</p>",
  "<p>Rupert Murdoch brokered a \"tentative truce\" between Barack Obama, the presidential candidate who has won his enthusiastic backing, and the head of Fox News, the influential rightwing network he owns that has regularly pilloried the Democratic nominee, the media mogul's biographer has revealed. </p> <p>Michael Wolff, a US media commentator who enjoyed unprecedented access to the 77-year-old News Corp chairman, describes in an article for Vanity Fair how Murdoch's meeting with Roger Ailes descended into a furious dispute before resulting in a \"tentative truce\". </p> <p>He outlines how Murdoch has enthusiastically courted Obama even though the Democratic candidate repeatedly snubbed his advances, and this despite senior News Corp executives having recruited the Kennedys to act as go-betweens. </p> <p>This marked a \"leap\" for the mogul - whose empire stretches from the Sun, the Times and BSkyB in the UK to 20th Century Fox, the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal in the US, and Star TV in Asia - because \"Murdoch has traditionally liked politicians to come to him\".</p> <p>Wolff relates that Obama finally relented early in the summer and the pair met with Ailes at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York. </p> <p>According to Wolff's account, the meeting began cordially, with Obama asking Murdoch about his relationship with his father and his path from a single Adelaide newspaper to global media magnate. In turn, the mogul imparted his view that, having known possibly as many heads of state as anyone living today and met every US president since Harry Truman, nobody had much time to make an impression - \"leadership was about what you did in the first six months\". </p> <p>But as Murdoch switched places with Ailes, Obama \"lit into\" the Fox News man. \"He said that he didn't want to waste his time talking to Ailes if Fox was just going to continue to abuse him and his wife, that Fox had relentlessly portrayed him as suspicious, foreign, fearsome - just short of a terrorist,\" wrote Wolff, who was not present at the meeting but said yesterday his detailed account was correct \"to the very best of my knowledge\". </p> <p>\"Ailes, unruffled, said it might not have been this way if Obama had more willingly come on the air instead of so often giving Fox the back of his hand. A tentative truce, which may or may not have vast historical significance, was at that moment agreed upon.\"</p> <p>\"Murdoch is strongly, if not firmly, in the Obama camp. How that plays out on Fox is another question,\" Wolff said yesterday. \"He actually has relatively little ability to affect what's on Fox, assuming he doesn't want to fire Roger Ailes, which I don't think he does. But I do think he would prefer him to be a little less unreconstructed.\"</p> <p>The opinion-led US news network became intrinsically linked with the Bush administration and its key pundits have enthusiastically backed John McCain. </p> <p>In the article, to be published on Friday, Wolff says Murdoch, partly due to the influence of his third wife Wendi, is \"becoming a liberal - sort of\". </p> <p>\"Fox has been his alter ego. For a long time he was in love with the Fox chief, Roger Ailes, because he was even more Murdoch than Murdoch. And yet now the embarrassment can't be missed - he mumbles even more than usual when called on to justify it; he barely pretends to hide the way he feels about [Fox pundit] Bill O'Reilly. And while it is not possible that he would give Fox up - because the money is the money; success trumps all - in the larger sense of who he is, he seems to want to hedge his bets.\"</p> <p>The article, based on almost weekly interviews with Murdoch over a nine-month period, also paints a revealing portrait of Murdoch's love of mischievous gossip, his closeness to his children, his visceral passion for newspapers and his unsated ambition to add to his empire. </p> <p>Wolff, a Vanity Fair contributing editor who wrote a book about his experience of the dotcom bust before reinventing himself as a media pundit, also believes Murdoch is serious in his ambition to buy the New York Times, the liberal totem that has cast him as \"bogeyman and vulgarian\". </p> <p>But when Wolff asks Murdoch in their final interview what he can do to prevent what happened to the Bancrofts, the old Wall Street Journal dynasty, from happening to his family, he throws his hands up in the air and says: \"Oh, simple, I can't. All I can do is delay it.\"</p>",
  "<p>As teenage pregnancy takes centre stage in the presidential race, advocacy groups are hoping to sidestep politics and open a new debate over the effectiveness of sex education in the US.</p> <p>Leaders of both parties have said the pregnancy of Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin's daughter should not become a campaign issue. Still, advocates are gently urging that the story of 17-year-old Bristol Palin open a national dialog on teenage sexuality.</p> <p>\"What I hope this does is really highlight the fact that Senator McCain's positions as a presidential candidate, and Governor Palin's as his running mate, are completely out of touch with what teens need in America,\" Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards said. </p> <p>\"They need comprehensive education, they need support in making responsible decisions,\" she added. \"This is an issue that the American public has reason to be interested in [the candidates'] positions on.\"</p> <p>As governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin supported funding abstinence-only education in schools. She wrote that \"explicit sex-ed programmes will not find my support\" on a 2006 election questionnaire.</p> <p>Palin was called \"pro-contraception\" <a href=\"http://dwb.adn.com/news/politics/elections/governor06/story/8049298p-7942233c.html\">during her gubernatorial run</a>. </p> <p>However, she is also a member of the anti-abortion group Feminists for Life, which raises concerns on its website that \"certain forms of contraception have had adverse health effects on women\".</p> <p>McCain has a similar record of opposing funding for sex education that includes contraceptives as a viable choice for teenagers. </p> <p>Asked in 2007 whether he backed George Bush's policy of abstinence-only sex education, McCain wavered before <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/03/16/mccain-stumbles-on-hiv-prevention/\">asking an aide to remind him</a> of his position.</p> <p>\"[W]ould you find out what my position is on contraception -- I'm sure I'm opposed to government spending on it, I'm sure I support the president's policies on it,\" McCain said.</p> <p>Speaking on Fox news yesterday, McCain spokeswoman Nancy Pfotenhauer warned liberal activists and bloggers that \"they just hurt their own credibility\" by using the Palin pregnancy to question the viability of Republican-backed sex education policies.</p> <p>\"Shame on them for trying to make a political issue out of a private family matter,\" Pfotenhauer said.</p> <p>That argument was anticipated by Rob Boston, a spokesman for Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</p> <p>\"The religious right and conservative groups backing McCain will certainly imply that any discussion of the larger issue of how sex education is taught in the US is off base because this is a private family matter,\" Boston said. \"I disagree with that.\"</p> <p>\"We can use this incident as a \u2026 moment to examine where we are on the issue of sex education and ask the candidates what they want to do on this particular issue.\"</p> <p>The teenage birth rate in America rose in 2006 after nearly 15 years of decline, with about 435,000 babies born to mothers between 15 and 19 years of age. </p> <p>More than 729,000 teenage pregnancies are reported in the US each year, according to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.</p> <p>Jessica Sheets, a spokeswoman for the National Campaign, said the Bristol Palin pregnancy \"is a really good way to say, 'this could be happening to anybody'\".</p> <p>\"We should be looking at more options here,\" she added. \"We don't want to limit ourselves to only talking about X or only about Y.\"</p> <p>The Palin flap is the third teenage pregnancy saga this year to capture American attention. Jamie Lynn Spears, the 16-year-old sister of pop singer Britney Spears, delivered a baby daughter in June amid reports of a pregnancy \"pact\" \u2013 later debunked \u2013 among high-school girls in the small town of Gloucester, Massachusetts.</p> <p>\"It's clearly time that we all start talking about the bigger picture on teen pregnancy -- and not just a couple of cases, but the thousands of young women each year who need help preventing pregnancy,\" Martha Kempner, a vice-president at the Sexuality Information and Education Council of America, said.</p> <p>Abstinence-only education is explicitly endorsed in this year's Republican party platform, which calls forgoing sex before marriage \"the responsible and expected standard of behaviour\". </p> <p>A decade-long study of abstinence education, authorised by Congress, found last year that it is as effective in preventing premarital sex as education that includes a broader slate of health options.

While the president remains popular with a majority of Republicans, according to polls, he is unpopular in the country at large and McCain is keen to keep his distance.</p> <p>The job of both Thompson and Lieberman is to fill out McCain's biographical details, just as Michelle Obama and others did for Barack Obama last week at the start of the Democratic convention in Denver.</p> <p>McCain cancelled the first day of the convention because he judged it would be insensitive to go ahead while the Gulf Coast was struck by the hurricane and he headed to the region.</p> <p>But, with New Orleans and most of the rest of the coast having escaped the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, McCain is anxious for the convention to fully resume and to secure prime-time television audiences.</p> <p>Only about a third of the delegates turned up on Monday for two hours of procedural business and a brief appearance by First Lady Laura Bush and McCain's wife, Cindy, both appealing for funds for victims of the hurricane.</p> <p>The normal bustle is expected to resume tonight, though the organisers said, in the light of the hurricane, they want to keep the tone subdued, and there would be little in the way of attacks on Obama.</p> <p>The convention organisers said they had not yet finalised the programme for Wednesday and Thursday, both of which have also had to be rewritten because of the disruption, but confirmed that McCain would deliver in person his speech accepting the nomination as presidential candidate and not by satellite, the back-up plan if Hurricane Gustav had proved catastrophic and he had remained in the region.</p> <p>The roll-call of delegates to formally nominate McCain as the party's presidential candidate is to be held Wednesday.</p> <p>With McCain and Obama virtually deadlocked in the polls and Obama having received no or only a slight poll rise from the convention, McCain is hoping he can capitalise this week and that he will get the bounce that Obama failed to.</p> <p>Almost the entire schedule today is devoted to the kind of schmaltz that appears to appeal to Americans but that European audiences would find hard to digest: hour after hour of sentimental details about McCain's life, from Cindy's adoption of a Bangladeshi child to a former Vietnam prisoner of war describing their time together in jail in Hanoi.</p> <p>Thompson is to talk about \"the courage and essence\" of John McCain while Lieberman will speak to the theme 'the original maverick', about the candidate's history of bucking the Republican line, part of the reason he is viewed with suspicion by many delegates.</p> <p>McCain is hoping that Lieberman will help him win over independents who would like to see a more bipartisan approach to politics in Washington.</p> <p>The disruption of the convention saw Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor who had also fought McCain unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination, bumped from a prime-time slot tonight to a still undetermined spot Wednesday or Thursday.</p> <p>Although the Republicans remained wary of indulging in attack politics at the convention today, they had no such scruples about ads. They released an ad today focusing on Obama's plans for tax rises. \"Take away the crowds, the chants, all that's left are costly words,\" the ad, to be broadcast in 14 battleground states, says.</p>",
  "<p>Over at samefacts.com, Mark Kleiman appears to have <a href=\"http://www.samefacts.com/archives/palin_/2008/09/sarah_palins_membership_in_the_alaskan_independence_party.php\">nailed down</a> the AIP membership story. Current party chair Lynette Clark says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Yes, Governor Palin was a member of the Alaskan Independence Party. She joined the Party and attended the AIP Statewide Convention held in Wasilla in 1994, along with her husband, Todd. In 1996 she changed her registration to Republican and Todd re-registered as undeclared, a registration he holds today.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now we have a situation where one of three people is lying. Clark is lying or Palin is lying to the McCain team or the McCain team knows the truth and is lying. Of the three, Clark would seem to have the least motivation to speak with forked tongue.</p>",
  "<p>I'm definitely, as you could tell by now, of the just-let-Sarah-Palin-collapse-under-her-own-weightlessness school. But not everyone is, and it's worth hearing the other view.</p> <p>The esteemed Ed Kilgore, with a long history in Democratic politics and first-hand knowledge of places like...the American South (!!), says maybe she <em>won't</em> just implode. He <a href=\"http://www.thedemocraticstrategist.org/strategist/2008/09/mccains_real_person.php\">says </a>at his blog that Democrats have to attack her, and not for her lack of experience, but for her outer-winguttia views on issues. Kilgore writes:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>... Democrats should focus on her nutty views and questionable associations rather than her lack of experience in characterizing this critical decision by John McCain as reckless and irresponsible. Struggling with a choice between satisfying a restless Right and reinforcing his \"maverick\" street cred, McCain found a running-mate who was a \"maverick\" from the Right. And the one thing Democrats should not let McCain get away with this week is the contention that Palin has a natural claim on support and affection from moderate swing voters, particularly women who don't believe in compulsory pregnancy. </p> </blockquote> <p>Check it out. Worth considering. I know my commenters will find this difficult to accept, but I might actually be wrong.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>News moves so fast these days that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/denver\">Democratic national convention</a> already seems something like a dream, though it only concluded last Thursday - with a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/02/tvratings.democrats2008\">Barack Obama discourse</a> grounded firmly in reality. The presidential hopeful's speech, given 45 years after Martin Luther King told listeners gathered at the national mall that he had a dream, woke me up. I'd been a Hillary Clinton supporter who threw my support behind Obama only grudgingly after she left the race, finding him big on charm but low on substance. After hearing him from Denver, though, I feel more confident that he'll turn this country around.<br> One of the many things that roused me was Obama's acknowledgment that it's getting tougher to live out the most simple of American dreams: that of working hard at a decent job so you can have a comfortable life - with enough money to take care of yourself and your family, enjoy good healthcare and eventually retire without fears you won't be able to afford it.</p> <p>That's an actuality that the Republicans like to ignore. As Obama noted, the standard rhetoric of John McCain's party is that any American should be able to pull herself up by her bootstraps if she works hard enough. To prove this point, Republicans often refer to people who've been able to do just that, citing the likes of Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice to underscore their point.<br> However, people like Rice - and Obama himself - have not pulled themselves up simply by toiling harder than anyone else. They've also leveraged their unusual intelligence and personal charisma, helped along by formidable self-confidence and exceptional physical attractiveness. (And if you wanted to be snide, you might say that McCain helped to pull himself up by marrying a rich woman.) They are the exceptions to the rules. But in this age of media spectacle - when politicians' outlandish success stories are trotted out as proof it can happen to anyone, when supermarket tabloids are constantly trying to remind us how much movie stars are \"just like us\", when reality TV shows pluck people out of obscurity and make them into national celebrities - it can be hard to remember that for the average Joe or Jane, it's not always so easy to rise up.  Statistics bear out the true story, and the difficulty: \"The 'rags to riches' story is much more common in Hollywood than on Main Street,\" as the authors of the Pew Charitable Trust's <a href=\"http://www.economicmobility.org/\">Economic Mobility Project</a> concluded in a <a href=\"http://www.economicmobility.org/assets/pdfs/EMP_American_Dream.pdf\">recent report</a> (pdf). Only 6% of children born into the bottom socioeconomic quintile move to the very top quintile, the authors found, after comparing the income of parents in the late 1960s with the income of their offspring in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p> <p>What's more, anyone raised by middle-class parents was almost equally likely to move down a rung on the socioeconomic ladder as to move up. \"Recent studies suggest that there is less economic mobility in the United States than has long been presumed,\" the authors wrote. \"The last 30 years has seen a considerable drop-off in median household income growth compared to earlier generations. And, by some measurements, we are actually a less mobile society than many other nations, including Canada, France, Germany and most Scandinavian countries. This challenges the notion of America as the land of opportunity.\"<br> However, I think many of us still believe that we should be able to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps - and that if we haven't been able to, there's something wrong with us. The American dream has become so unattainable that it's begun to inspire a certain sense of American self-loathing in those who can't achieve it, despite the fact that in the real world - as opposed to The Real World - plenty of Americans work incredibly long hours, often trying to juggle two or three jobs, just to get by.</p> <p>These people do not constitute a nation of whiners, as the McCain adviser whom Obama pilloried in his speech would have you think. In fact, the government deserves a good amount of blame for their dilemma, as Obama stated, because it hasn't given the working class decent tax breaks, spurred economic growth and created new job opportunities or made health insurance and college affordable.<br> But Obama wants to change all that. He is promising to increase taxes on the very rich while cutting them for the middle class, create programmes that will increase employment and make both healthcare and college affordable for everyone. In his speech, Obama talked about the experiences of himself and his family to let his audience know he understood just how hard it can be to pull yourself up, noting that success is difficult to achieve without good governmental policies in place. And yet, at the same time, he connected his personal story - and the hope that's implicit in it - to the struggles of the average American. I'm sure I'm not the only who felt, after hearing it, like I could have a dream again: of being able to afford to raise a family; achieve greater financial success than my father (an Irish immigrant and construction worker who, you might say, pulled himself up by his bootstraps); and live in a prosperous, contented country that's respected around the world.  This is one former Hillary supporter who is now fully behind Obama - and more because of what he told me than because of Hillary's powerful speech last week. Obama does seem to understand what real Americans are going through, and to want to provide us with some relief. That stands in sharp contrast to McCain's choice of Sarah Palin - an anti-feminist abortion-rights opponent with little experience, who shut down people who disagreed with her, according to Alaskan Senate president, Republican Lyda Green. </p> <p>Some commentators have attempted to draw comparisons between her and Obama, but that seems ridiculous to me. A woman who can't empathise with the plights of other women, or even listen to the people around her, is not someone who should be in the White House.</p>",

  "<p>The McCain camp has fired off a statement swearing that Palin is the victim of smears and was always an enrolled Republican. I got it copied'n'pasted into an email, so you'll need to go find it yourself, but it says this:</p> <blockquote> <p>The allegations that Gov. Palin was a member of Alaska Independence<br>Party are false. She's never been a member of the Alaska Independence<br>Party.</p> <p>Gov. Palin has been a registered Republican ever since 1982, as the<br>records attached show.</p> <p>It would be nice if the media outlets covering this garbage actually did<br>their due diligence in reporting, and didn't just push Obama<br>campaign/Daily Kos smears.</p> </blockquote> <p>It came complete with a .pdf purporting to show her voter enrollment forms back to 1982.</p> <p>But this proves nothing. Only a few states have multiple political parties the way Alaska does. I covered one for years, New York. Many New Yorkers were enrolled Democrats, because they wanted to vote in Democratic primaries, which is where the action was, but they nevertheless attended meetings of one of the smaller parties (Working Families, Liberal, Green, the wacko New Alliance Party) and thus could fairly be called \"members.\" </p> <p>And anyway, these aren't Obama-Kos smears. Several AIP members have stepped forward to say she was a member, like the fellow in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHFY1otOWjQ\">this video</a>, at about 6:15. So these aren't smears. These are AIP-ites braggin' on it.</p>",
  "<p>Check out <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/10/wolff200810?currentPage=2\">this new one</a> from Michael Wolff of Vanity Fair. He describes, for the first time, a meeting among Rupert Murdoch, Roger Ailes and Barack Obama that took place over the summer. Fascinating stuff.</p> <p>The meeting had been sought for some time. Now, in reading that sentence, you assumed that I meant Obama sought the meeting. But it was the other way around! Now <em>that </em>takes a set, no? Read on:</p> <blockquote> <p>Obama, on the other hand, was snubbing Murdoch. Every time he reached out (Murdoch executives tried to get the Kennedys to help smooth the way to an introduction), nothing. The Fox stain was on Murdoch.</p> </blockquote> <p>Eventually, it happened. Rupert and Barack sat \"knee to knee.\" Obama started asking Murdoch about his relationship with his father. In due course Ailes took Rupe's place, and Obama basically said to him, I'm not gonna waste my time talking to you as long as your network is just gonna slap me and my wife around. Wolff reports that \"a tentative truce was agreed upon.\"</p> <p>So. I've been an amateur Murdochologist for two decades now, and my cursory reading of the New York Post this year, which I pick up about two times a week or so \u2013 the paper does have some very good reporters, and it features <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/gossip/cindy/cindy.htm\">the hardest-working newspaper columnist in America bar none</a> \u2013 has long indicated to me that the Post is covering Obama pretty fairly and quite clearly leaving open the option of endorsing Obama.</p> <p>Fox is Fox. It has a constituency of hard-core Republicans and it has to service that constituency. Besides, it is mostly run and staffed by hard-core Republicans. So it will be McCain's amen corner, whatever its reservations about him. As for The Wall Street Journal, its editorial page is run by conservatives who are also very committed to Republican power. Rupert's the boss and can do what he wants, but I suspect the businessman in him would understand that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/apr/20/election2005.uk4\">pulling a Blair</a> with so revered a sheet as the Journal might create credibility issues.</p> <p>The Post, however, is an instrument of his will; it really has no identity outside Murdoch. He can do what he wants with it. And he just may decide that Obama is Blair-like, or Blair-like enough \u2013 and, of course, that Obama would sell more papers for four years than McCain, which is undoubtedly the case. </p> <p>The circumstances in early November would have to be exactly right: it will need to look as if Obama is going to win anyway, and on the statesman vs. Muslim-terrorist scale, Obama will need to be tilting strongly toward the former. But I've always said it's possible that the Post will back Obama. Wolff's report backs me up on this. His wife, Wendi, \"has been attending fund-raisers for Obama in Los Angeles with David Geffen.\" Wives tend to have influence in these situations.</p>",
  "<p>Oh, most likely. But the very fact that the question needs to be asked \u2013 and I'm not the only one asking it, believe me \u2013 indicates what a joke Sarah Palin has already become. Wednesday night, she'll speak before an audience that (mostly) loves her \u2013 delegates to a GOP convention tilt heavily toward the socially conservative. That will sustain her for the week. But whether she'll survive the month of September seems a genuinely serious question.</p> <p>Of the several Achilles' Heels floating around, her former membership in the Alaskan Independence Party is the largest. McCain's motto for this campaign is \"Country First.\" The AIP's motto is \"Alaska First \u2013 Alaska Always.\" It's a fringe right-wing party, some of whose members want Alaska to separate from the US.</p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/09/members-of-frin.html\">As ABC News reported</a>, she was actually an enrolled member in the 1990s. Now think about that. In her small hometown where she was already fairly prominent and everyone knew her, she went down to the courthouse and asked a clerk for a voter-enrollment form. And she checked the box next to this fringe, weirdo party. That's quite an act of self-definition. She seems to have re-registered as a Republican to run for mayor.</p> <p>Here's yet another one: <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/01/AR2008090103148.html?sid=ST2008090103340&amp;s_pos=\" \">The Washington Post reports today</a> that Palin, as mayor, hired a Washington lobbying firm to secure around $27 million in federal earmarks for her town. McCain of course has made his opposition to earmarks a central platform plank. </p> <p>Palin likes to cast herself as a foe of the old GOP guard in Alaska, led by indicted Senator Ted Stevens, of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravina_Island_Bridge fame\">\"Bridge to Nowhere\"</a> . But Stevens chaired the Senate committee that dishes out these earmarks during most of the years Palin was seeking the funds. Then comes this graf, which may prove to be a killer: </p> <blockquote> <p>In addition, Palin has reversed course on at least one major earmark: After initially supporting the $223 million bridge, which was to connect the town of Ketchikan with a remote island, she reversed course last year and canceled the project because of cost overruns. Critics have dubbed the project the \"Bridge to Nowhere.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So she was for the Bridge to Nowhere before she was against it! <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esUTn6L0UDU\">Sound familiar? </a>The Democrats ought to have plenty of fun with that one!</p> <p>There's surely more on the way. In four days, she's become a punch line. Democrats should go after her here and there, but again, the main target should be the man of such alleged wisdom and judgment that, when he didn't get what we wanted, threw up his hands, stomped his feet at the other boys on the playground, said the hell with this and chose the absolutely most unqualified running mate he could have chosen. McCain could still win this election \u2013 of course. There's a long, long way to go. But if he loses, Palin will go down as maybe the single most boneheaded decision a presidential candidate has ever made in America. </p>",
  "<p>The Republican party is seeking to resume normal service at its convention with high-profile speakers lined up to praise John McCain in his presidential election contest with Barack Obama.</p> <p>Republicans say Fred Thompson, one of the failed presidential hopefuls, and Joe Lieberman, the Democrat turned independent, will speak tonight about McCain's biography and their friendship with him. </p> <p>Aides said McCain would probably deliver his nomination acceptance speech in person tomorrow.</p> <p>White House officials held out the possibility that George Bush would make a televised address to the convention from Washington, although the McCain campaign has tried to distance itself from the highly unpopular president. </p> <p>Bush and Dick Cheney, the vice-president, cancelled their appearances yesterday, even before convention organisers decided to scale back ceremonies because of Hurricane Gustav.</p> <p>As Gustav forced a scaledown of the normal convention hoopla, McCain's vice-presidential running mate, Sarah Palin, the Alaska governor, appears to have energised the Republican base.</p> <p>McCain's surprise choice of a political unknown has injected fresh energy into the McCain campaign, leading to larger crowds at his rallies. Since he made the announcement last Friday, his campaign has raised $10m (\u00a35m), contributing to an August tally of $47m.</p> <p>But Palin's family life has proved to be a distraction. She and her husband, Todd, yesterday announced that their 17-year-old daughter, Bristol, is pregnant. They said the news was being released to counter internet rumours that Palin's five-month-old son is actually her daughter's baby.</p> <p>Republicans have been talking up Palin. \"I just think she's remarkable,\" Cindy McCain told Fox News. \"She truly is a great match for my husband.\"</p> <p>In Monroe, Michigan, Barack Obama condemned rumours involving the children of candidates and echoed the McCain campaign argument.</p> <p>He said: \"I think people's families are off limits, and people's children are especially off limits.\"</p> <p>Prominent religious conservatives rallied behind Palin. James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family, commended the Palins \"for not just talking about their pro-life and pro-family values, but living them out even in the midst of trying circumstances\".</p> <p>Details of Palin's family life raised questions about the McCain campaign's vetting process. The man who led McCain's vice-presidential search team said he thought everything that had come up as a possible red flag during the background check had now been made public.</p> <p>\"I think so,\" Arthur Culvahouse told the Associated Press. \"Yes. I think so. Correct.\"</p> <p>With Hurricane Gustav dominating the headlines yesterday, Laura Bush, the first lady, joined forces with Cindy McCain at the cut-down convention in St Paul, Minnesota, to appeal for cash for victims.</p> <p>The first lady received a standing ovation when she appeared, as did the would-be first lady when she appeared 10 minutes later.</p> <p>Although Gustav turned out to be less serious than predicted, Republicans are keen to be seen to be sensitive after the failure of Bush to act when New Orleans was flooded in 2005.</p> <p>With almost all of the first day of the convention scrapped, the hall was only a third full. The arrival of Laura Bush and Cindy McCain came as a relief to the delegates after two hours of procedural discussion necessary - for legal reasons - to nominate McCain.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday September 10 2008</strong></p> <p> In the article below it was stated that Sarah Palin was a member of the Alaskan Independence party. The Alaskan Independence party subsequently issued a statement saying it had been wrong to claim Sarah Palin was a member. </p> <p> </p> <p>New revelations about the Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin \u2014 including her membership of a party that wants Alaskans to vote on becoming a separate country \u2014 are raising questions about how thoroughly John McCain's campaign vetted her background before adding her to the ticket.</p> <p>Palin was a member of the Alaskan Independence party (AIP) before becoming an elected Republican official, according to party members, and recorded a video message for the AIP convention this year. The AIP's chief goal is securing Alaska a vote on seceding from the US, a goal that party leaders believe the state was denied before it became part of the US almost 50 years ago.</p> <p>Yet it is the AIP's motto, \"Alaska First, Alaska Always\", that may cause the most trouble for McCain. The Republican's campaign slogan this year is \"Country First\".</p> <p>At the convention where Palin's video was played, the AIP vice-chairman, George Clark, told the audience that she was an AIP member before getting her first political post as mayor of the small town of Wasilla, Alaska.</p> <p>\"But you get along to go along \u2014 she eventually joined the Republican party, where she had all kinds of problems with their ethics, and well, I won't go into that,\" Clark said. \"She also had about an 80% approval rating, and is pretty well sympathetic to her former membership.\"</p> <p>Palin suggested in a July interview with CNBC news that she would insist on making Alaskan issues a high priority before agreeing to serve as a vice-presidential candidate. \"We want to make sure that that VP slot would be a fruitful type of position, especially for Alaskans, and for the things we're trying to accomplish up here for the rest of the US, before I can even start addressing that question,\" she said.</p> <p>In response to the AIP flap, the McCain camp denied that Palin was a party member and released voter registration documents that showed her affiliating with Republicans. \"If the Alaska Independence Party at some point taught Governor Palin their secret handshake, there is no record of it,\" McCain aide Michael Goldfarb wrote on the campaign's website. \"Otherwise, the only relevant criterion for membership in a party is registration -- and Palin has never been a member of the AIP.</p> <p>Intense media scrutiny of Palin since she became McCain's running mate four days ago has led to speculation that the Republican party failed to fully examine her background. In addition to the pregnancy of Palin's 17-year-old unmarried daughter, Bristol, several other disclosures threaten to throw the McCain camp into turmoil.</p> <p>Palin has promoted her independence from Alaska's powerful senior senator, Ted Stevens, who is facing seven criminal charges in Washington. But she served for two years as a director for one of his political groups that was able to raise unlimited money from corporate patrons.</p> <p>Palin faced pressure to resign as mayor of Wasilla in 1997 after she fired the city police chief for not fully supporting her agenda, leading to a lawsuit for breach of contract.</p> <p>In Alaska, Palin faces an ethics investigation into whether she abused her office by firing the public safety commissioner, who refused to intervene in a messy divorce case involving her sister. Palin has hired an attorney to help her handle the case, leading to another round of embarrassing press coverage.</p> <p>McCain's spokesman, Tucker Eskew, defended the selection: \"This legal defence is neither new nor uncommon nor at all political. It is a matter of her job and is not recent and it is not related to her selection on the McCain-Palin ticket.\"</p>",
  "<p>Taro Aso, one of the most controversial figures in Japanese politics, has emerged as the favourite to replace Yasuo Fukuda, less than 24 hours after the prime minister announced his surprise resignation.</p> <p>While Aso stopped short of officially announcing his candidacy, the 67-year-old hawk made no secret of his ambitions.</p> <p>\"Mr Fukuda said last night that he wanted a successor to take over what he has done,\" he told reporters today. \"I believe I am qualified to take over [his] agenda.\"</p> <p>Aso, a former foreign minister whom Fukuda appointed secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) only last month, hails from solid political stock.</p> <p>His grandfather, Shigeru Yoshida, twice served as prime minister in the decade after the war, while his wife is the daughter of another former leader, Zenko Suzuki. Aso's younger sister is married to the Prince Tomohito of Mikasa, a cousin of Emperor Akihito.</p> <p>While Fukuda was criticised for lacking charisma, Aso has stoked controversy with a succession of ill-judged outbursts, often directed at Japan's former wartime victims.</p> <p>In 2003 he upset Koreans when he praised Japan's often brutal colonisation of the Korean peninsula from 1910-1945; last year he suggested that US diplomats in the Middle East would never be trusted to solve the region's problems because they had \"blue eyes and blond hair\".</p> <p>As economics minister, he said he wanted to turn Japan into a country where \"rich Jews\" would want to live.</p> <p>During the second world war, his father's mining company used Allied POWs as slave labourers. Aso joined the firm in 1966 and was president for most of the 1970s, but has refused to apologise for its past use of forced labour.</p> <p>He did apologise, however, for an ill-judged remark about Alzheimer's sufferers, but created uproar again last month when he likened the opposition to the Nazis because of their obstructionist tactics in parliament.</p> <p>He wants class-A war criminals \"delisted\" from Yasukuni, a shrine in Tokyo that honours Japan's war dead, thereby removing the biggest obstacle to members of the imperial family resuming their annual visits.</p> <p>Aso's privileged background, and charges that he is out of touch with ordinary Japanese, may explain his gaffe-strewn past.</p> <p>\"It is precisely because he wants to dampen the image that he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth that he sometimes feels the need to behave like a naughty boy,\" a former Aso aide, who did not want to be named, told the Guardian.</p> <p>\"There are concerns over whether he can handle delicate matters, but he knows that even though the country would enjoy his colourful side, to make his premiership last he will need to remain tight-lipped on certain matters.\"</p> <p>Aso, who represented Japan in shooting at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, is an unlikely poster boy among young Japanese who share his passion for manga comics.</p> <p>News of his probable candidacy today sent shares soaring in Mandarake, a chain of comic bookstores, and in his family-run foam concrete company.</p> <p>Aso's hard-line stance against China and North Korea has secured him bete-noire status among Japan's neighbours, but his conservative populism plays well at home. A poll published yesterday put his personal approval rating at 26%, well ahead of Fukuda (5%) and Ichiro Ozawa, the leader of the biggest opposition party, the Democratic party of Japan (DPJ) on 8%.</p> <p><strong>A daunting task</strong></p> <p>Whoever wins the leadership contest on September 22nd will automatically become prime minister due to the LDP's huge majority in the lower house.</p> <p>Though the LDP has been out of office for only 10 months since its formation in 1955, it is hard to recall a less opportune moment to take over the party's leadership.</p> <p>Fukuda's hand was forced by policy deadlock in parliament that began as soon as the opposition Democratic party of Japan secured an upper house majority in July last year.</p> <p>The opposition briefly halted Japan's refueling mission in the Indian Ocean - a small but symbolically important contribution to the US-led war on terror - and blocked Fukuda's preferred candidate for governor of the Bank of Japan.</p> <p>Fukuda's resignation amounts to an admission that he was not prepared to launch into another round of tussling with Ozawa when parliament reconvenes, probably at the end of the month.</p> <p>Though an election is not due until September 2009, critics pointed out that Japan is about to get its third prime minister with no popular mandate since the LDP won a landslide under the popular reformer Junichiro Koizumi in September 2005.</p> <p>\"All we want is for an election to be called,\" the DPJ's secretary general, Yukio Hatoyama, said today. \"[Fukuda's] sudden abandonment proves that the LDP is not fit to hold the reins of power.\"</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/rupertmurdoch\">Rupert Murdoch</a> helped broker a \"tentative truce\" between Democratic presidential candidate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> and key News Corporation lieutenant Roger Ailes, the boss of Fox News Channel, earlier this year, according to the media mogul's biographer.</p> <p>Murdoch, the News Corp chairman and chief executive, was forced to court Obama after the rising star of US politics rebuffed his initial approaches, it is believed because of what he saw as the derogatory coverage of him and his wife, Michelle, on Fox News, according to Michael Wolff.</p> <p>The News Corp boss also advised Wolff, his biographer, to vote for the man who eventually became the Democratic presidential candidate during the New York primary earlier this year, saying: \"He'll sell more papers.\"</p> <p>These revelations are <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/10/wolff200810\">reported in the October edition of Vanity Fair magazine</a>, which details contributing editor Wolff's interviews with Rupert Murdoch over a period of nine months for his upcoming biography of the media mogul, The Man Who Owns the News.</p> <p>After initially snubbing offers of a get-together with the media tycoon, made through the Kennedy family, Obama relented and a secret courtesy meeting with Murdoch was arranged at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, according to Wolff.</p> <p>When Obama eventually met Murdoch early this summer in secret, they were joined by Ailes, who runs News Corp's Fox News Channel.</p> <p>Wolff reported in Vanity Fair that during the meeting Obama and Murdoch sat knee to knee, with the older man offering the prospective candidate advice.</p> <p>\"Murdoch, for his part, had a simple thought to share with Obama. He had known possibly as many heads of state as anyone living today - had met every American president from Harry Truman on - and this is what he understood: nobody got much time to make an impression. Leadership was about what you did in the first six months,\" wrote Wolff.</p> <p>But Wolff claimed things were different when Ailes took Murdoch's place.</p> <p>\"Obama lit into Ailes. He said that he didn't want to waste his time talking to Ailes if Fox was just going to continue to abuse him and his wife, that Fox had relentlessly portrayed him as suspicious, foreign, fearsome - just short of a terrorist,\" he wrote.</p> <p>\"Ailes, unruffled, said it might not have been this way if Obama had more willingly come on the air instead of so often giving Fox the back of his hand.</p> <p>\"A tentative truce, which may or may not have vast historical significance, was at that moment agreed upon.\"</p> <p>In the Vanity Fair article Wolff also claimed that Murdoch advised him to vote for Obama during the democratic primaries.</p> <p>\"Just before the New York Democratic primary, when I found myself undecided between Clinton and Obama, I said to Murdoch (a little flirtation, like a little gossip, softens him), 'Rupert, I don't know who to vote for - so I'm going to give you my vote. You choose',\" he wrote.</p> <p>\"He paused, considered, nodded his head slowly: 'Obama - he'll sell more papers.'\"</p> <p>Murdoch courting Obama marks something of role reversal from the mid-1990s, when UK prime minister-in-waiting Tony Blair actively courted Murdoch as part of his bid for power.</p> <p>\"This is a leap for Murdoch. Murdoch has traditionally liked politicians to come to him. His historic shift in the 1990s to Tony Blair came after Blair made a pilgrimage to Australia,\" wrote Wolff.</p> <p>\"Obama, on the other hand, was snubbing Murdoch. Every time he reached out (Murdoch executives tried to get the Kennedys to help smooth the way to an introduction), nothing. The Fox stain was on Murdoch.\"</p> <p>However, the \"Fox stain\", as Wolff calls it, does not appear to be one that Murdoch is so comfortable with any more. </p> <p>Wolff wrote that the influence of Murdoch's wife Wendi and the courting of more liberal figures in the media has raised a conflict in the News Corp founder, as he would love to build on his purchase of the Wall Street Journal by taking over the New York Times.</p> <p>\"He is spending time now in consideration of an even more far-fetched fantasy, the New York Times: he'd really like to own it too,\" Wolff added.</p> <p>\"Now, everybody around him continues to tell him that buying the Times is pretty much impossible. There will be regulatory problems. The Sulzberger family would never \u2026 And then there's the opprobrium of public opinion.</p> <p>\"But it's obviously irresistible to him. I've watched him go through the numbers, plot out a merger with the Journal's backroom operations, and fantasise about the staff's quitting en masse as soon as he entered the sacred temple.\"</p> <p>This increasing desire to move for titles away from his traditional right-of-centre political power base is mirrored by a cooling toward Fox News Channel, according to Wolff.</p> <p>\"It's life with Wendi versus life with Fox. (And, too, it's the Wall Street Journal - and maybe the New York Times - versus Fox),\" he wrote in Vanity Fair.</p> <p>\"Fox has been his alter ego. For a long time he was in love with the Fox chief, Roger Ailes, because he was even more Murdoch than Murdoch. And yet now the embarrassment can't be missed - he mumbles even more than usual when called on to justify it; he barely pretends to hide the way he feels about [Fox presenter] Bill O'Reilly. </p> <p>\"And while it is not possible that he would give Fox up - because the money is the money; success trumps all - in the larger sense of who he is, he seems to want to hedge his bets.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>The Washington Post wonders how women voters, whom it describes as <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/01/AR2008090102726.html?sid=ST2008090103314&amp;s_pos=list\">often the harshest critics of women in public life,</a> will react to the news that the Republican vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, is to become a grandmother at the age of 44. </p> <p>Palin's unmarried 17-year-old daughter, Bristol, is pregnant, a statement said. Bizarrely, the statement was issued in response to rumours on US blogs which suggested that Palin's fifth child, Trig, born in April with Down's Syndrome, could belong to Bristol.</p> <p>One website shows pictures of Palin and Bristol under the headline \"Palin Faked the Pregnancy?\", and questions why Palin's pregnancy \u2013 which she announced for the first time when she was seven months pregnant \u2013 did not appear obvious while Bristol has a rounded stomach. The rumour was finally scotched by the statement.</p> <p>Bristol's pregnancy and other disclosures about McCain's running mate, leads the New York Times to question how thoroughly he had investigated her background before he appointed her. </p> <p>A Republican source tells the paper that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/02/us/politics/02vetting.html?_r=2&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin\">the team assigned to vet Palin only arrived in her home state, Alaska, on Thursday - a day before McCain announced her selection. </a></p> <p>Such is the fascination with Palin, a mother of five, that news of the pregnancy makes the front pages across the Atlantic too. The Telegraph says Palin's announcement has <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/johnmccain/2662897/US-elections-Daughter-of-John-McCains-running-mate-Sarah-Palin-is-pregnant.html\">\"rocked\" the race for the White House.</a> Bristol plans to marry her boyfriend, Levi, but the paper suggests that the news could embarrass those on the religious right of the party that McCain was hoping to woo. </p> <p>The Times dispatched a reporter to Wasilla, Palin's home town, which she served as mayor until two years ago, to see if all the stories about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gallery/2008/sep/01/republicans2008.palin?picture=337165827\">her astonishing life were true</a>. The reporter is unimpressed by the <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article4656243.ece\">\"small, unkempt looking town\"</a> but reports that the locals are enthusiastic about their local star.</p> <p>New York's Newsday discusses whether Palin, described by some as the feminist ideal, is <a href=\"http://www.newsday.com/news/printedition/longisland/ny-powome315823805aug31,0,2956192.story\">pro-women.</a> The short answer seems to be 'no'.</p> <p>The Times' Alpha Mummy website for working mothers says it has been inundated with comments about <a href=\"http://timesonline.typepad.com/alphamummy/\">\"Republican supermummy\"</a> Palin. One contributor from Washington DC asks what Palin has done and will do to help other working mothers.</p> <p>\"I have no issue with a woman who has lots of kids having a big job, but only if that woman also acknowledges that that is not something the majority of American women can swing because childcare here is too expensive, too underfunded and too badly regulated to allow for that. And that is not something the Republicans are even close to confronting.\"</p> <p>What do you make of Palin? And does it matter whether she is pro or anti-women, or indeed how she became a grandmother-to-be?</p>",
  "<p>So why is it that women get more chances on the political right than it seems they do on the left? Is there something not very progressive about progressives, is the right really gender-blind, or is there something else going on here?</p> <p>Long before <a href=\"http://www.feministsforlife.org/\">Feminist for Life</a> Sarah Palin, with her extraordinary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/02/palin.johnmccain\">personal biography</a>, burst out of Alaska, we had become accustomed to Condoleezza Rice bobbing into every shot over the shoulder of the most right wing US president in living memory. </p> <p>In Germany, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-big-question-how-has-angela-merkel-become-the-key-player-on-europes-political-stage-870814.html \">Angela Merkel</a> singlehandedly revived the Christian Democrats internal and global standing (although journalists still comment on her dress sense). </p> <p>What does the left have to offer? The misjudged courage of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, French presidential candidate of the left (remembered more nowadays for her <a href=\"http://warner.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/segolene-royal/?scp=2&amp;sq=segolene%20royale&amp;st=\" cse\"\"> private life</a> than her political success), or \u2013 well, <a href=\"http://www.harrietharman.org/\">Harriet Harman</a> ran a brilliant campaign last year to become Labour's deputy leader. </p> <p>And though it's more than 20 years since the Democrats first chose <a href=\"http://www.greatwomen.org/women.php?action=viewone&amp;id=61\">Geraldine Ferraro</a> to bring a little humanity to Walter Mondale's presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton's fate in the primaries has been widely interpreted as evidence that even American liberals don't think women can win.</p> <p>Each of the above is a different story. But collectively they raise a thought. The women on the right (who make it) share a common disregard for gender politics. The women on the left (who by and large haven't, or at least not yet) have made feminism an integral part of their public personality. </p> <p>Maybe Palin, who has already delivered for the McCain cause \u2013 er, no joke <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/02/uselections2008.republicans20084\">intended</a> \u2013 by bringing prominence to her anti-contraceptive, anti-abortion (even in cases of rape) pro-gun Conservative populism, proves that women prosper most in the mainstream. So does that mean women damage their chances by making gender a significant part of their political profile?</p> <p>And if they do, is that just more evidence of how enduring popular resistance is to social justice, or do those who are determined to lead change have to think again about how they do it?</p> <p>Some of the most prominent women in New Labour (Patricia Hewitt, for example, or Mo Mowlem) decided, even in opposition, that making gender politics the focus of their efforts damaged their party and themselves.</p> <p>The years of the Blair's babes proved them hideously right. All-women shortlists got women into parliament, but at a high short-term cost. There are now six women in cabinet, but each of them has still had to prove they are there on merit, and not because of some secret scheme of positive discrimination operated by the number ten image consultants. Nobody ever suggested Thatcher became leader of the Tory party because it was a woman's turn.</p> <p>Gender politics do matter. Inequality is an offence against social justice. But context matters too. It is always worth remembering that the minimum wage helped more women, more quickly, than equal pay legislation ever has.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain's campaign has invoked his five-year imprisonment in the infamous \"Hanoi Hilton\" as a catch-all response to all number of stories, from his <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/08/mccain_camp_responds_on_houses.php\">multiple house-ownership</a> to allegations that he <a href=\"http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/16589.html\">bent the rules</a> at last month's evangelical forum.</p> <p>But one of McCain's fellow Vietnam POWs is raising doubts today about the Republican nominee's emotional fitness to be president.

  "<p>In ideal world, perhaps the news that Sarah Palin's unmarried 17-year-old daughter Bristol is pregnant would be out of bounds, in terms of election campaign coverage. That was certainly how the Republicans would have preferred it, and in a public statement yesterday, Barack Obama agreed. But given Sarah Palin's socially conservative views \u2014 and the fact that almost nothing else happened at the convention in St Paul, Minnesota, yesterday \u2014 that was never going to be the case. The revelation fuelled the notion that she had been selected without proper vetting, and the perception in some quarters that McCain is given to ill-considered gambles. And it was not the only new piece of information to emerge about Sarah Palin: other disclosures, Ewen MacAskill <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/02/uselections2008.republicans20081\">writes in today's Guardian</a>, included the fact that her husband, Todd, was arrested for alleged drunk driving 20 years ago and that, more recently, she hired a lawyer to represent her in a state ethics investigation.</p> <p>Several thousand people demonstrated in downtown St Paul, despite the absence of their key antagonists, George Bush and Dick Cheney, though far fewer than the 50,000 organisers had predicted. By yesterday evening, the number of arrests had reportedly exceeded 280, with police using pepper spray tear gas. Inside the Xcel Energy Centre, Cindy McCain and Laura Bush briefly addressed delegates on the weather emergency on the Gulf coast.</p> <p>And <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/02/hurricanegustav.naturaldisasters4\">Hurricane Gustav</a>, the cause of the quiet in St Paul? New Orleans appeared to have escaped the worst of the hurricane, which was downgraded to Category 2 as it made landfall 70 miles south-west of the city.</p> <h2>Today at the convention</h2> <p>At a media conference call scheduled for this morning, the McCain campaign is due to reveal how much, if at all, today's proceedings will be disrupted as a result of the storm. In the original timetable, Rudy Giuliani had been due to speak today, along with Mike Huckabee and former Homeland Security secretary Tom Ridge. Reports now suggest Giuliani's appearance will be postponed. I'll be liveblogging the highlights, assuming any transpire, at <a href=\"blogs.theguardian.com/burkeman/\">blogs.theguardian.com/burkeman</a>.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>A new CBS poll gives Obama a lead of 48% to 40%, suggesting a small convention bounce. And his lead among women has increased since before the convention: it's now at 50% to 36%. The poll was conducted after the Palin announcement, suggesting that McCain's choice of running mate hasn't caused any mass defection of female and/or Hillary Clinton-supporting voters. 58% of voters think Obama is \"tough enough\" to be president \u2014 up from 48% in early August. A USA Today/Gallup poll, conducted on Saturday and Sunday, has Obama ahead 50% to 43%, up from a four-point lead immediately before the convention.</p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"Our beautiful daughter Bristol came to us with news that as parents we knew would make her grow up faster than we had ever planned.

  "<p>The partially rebuilt levees in New Orleans have held against hurricane Gustav, but authorities today warned of more storms to come after the weather system weakened and veered to the west of the city.</p> <p>Dramatic television footage showed waves being forced by 110mph winds over the tops of the flood defences on the west side of the city, just like Katrina in 2005. The hurricane made landfall near Cocodrie, a thinly populated town west of New Orleans known for its fishing and oil industries. </p> <p>Eight deaths were attributed to the storm in the US, but five of were traffic-related. Four people died in Georgia when their car hit a tree. </p> <p>A 27-year-old Lafayette man was killed when a tree fell on his home and an Abbeville couple died when a tree fell on a house in Baton Rouge. </p> <p>The New Orleans sewerage system was damaged and hospitals were working with skeleton crews on backup power. Drinking water continued to flow in the city and the pumps kept working \u2014 these two critical services failed during Katrina, contributing to its high toll.</p> <p>Sea level surges were limited to less than 3m (9ft) in some places. Katrina produced surges of 8m.</p> <p>The city's eastern wall, breached in 2005, has been repaired by the army corps in a rebuilding programme scheduled to last until 2012, but the western wall has yet to be reinforced because of a lack of funding.</p> <p>The city's mayor, Ray Nagin, warned residents it was too early yet to return but said their homecoming was \"only days away, not weeks\".</p> <p>He urged residents to \"resist the temptation to say 'we're out of the woods'\" and said heavy rainfall could still flood the city.</p> <p>The authorities took pride in a massive evacuation effort that succeeded in persuading people to leave on buses and trains. Almost 2 million people left coastal Louisiana, and only about 10,000 rode out the storm in New Orleans.</p> <p>\"I would not do a thing differently,\" Nagin said. \"I'd probably call Gustav, instead of the mother of all storms, maybe the mother-in-law or the ugly sister of all storms.\"</p> <p>Gustav devastated parts of Louisiana and Texas, destroying homes and flooding parts of mostly rural, low-lying parishes.<br> There are threats from other storms developing in the Atlantic. Hurricane Hanna strengthened today 40 miles north of the Bahamas and could hit the US later in the week. </p> <p>Tropical storm Ike, the ninth of the season, is brewing up behind Hanna in the mid-Atlantic.</p> <p>While Gustav did not reach Katrina's magnitude, it left communal and political chaos in its wake. The first day of the Republican party convention in St Paul, Minnesota, was disrupted as John McCain and his advisers struggled to find the appropriate tone.</p> <p>George Bush, who was criticised for negligent and insensitive handling of the Katrina crisis, cancelled his planned speech to the convention and went instead to Texas.</p> <p>At an emergency centre in Austin, he said: \"The coordination on this storm is a lot better than during Katrina.\"</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/02/us/politics/02vetting.html?pagewanted=2&amp;hp\">Stunning story</a> in Wednesday's NYT by Elisabeth Bumiller. The McCain team hardly vetted Sarah Palin at all, and the candidate hardly spoke with her and made this choice impetuously.</p> <p>He really wanted to select either Joe Lieberman or Tom Ridge, but both are pro-choice, and he was warned by conservatives that any pro-choicer would lead to a tremendous floor flight and fracturing of the party. He then shunned two obvious anti-abortion white men, Mitt Romney and Tim Pawlenty, and went with someone he hardly knew and his campaign hadn't really researched. For example: </p> <blockquote> <p>Representative Gail Phillips, a Republican and former speaker of the State House, said the widespread surprise in Alaska when Ms. Palin was named to the ticket made her wonder how intensively the McCain campaign had vetted her.</p> <p>\"I started calling around and asking, and I have not been able to find one person that was called,\" Ms. Phillips said. \"I called 30 to 40 people, political leaders, business leaders, community leaders. Not one of them had heard. Alaska is a very small community, we know people all over, but I haven't found anybody who was asked anything.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And:</p> <blockquote> <p>With time running out \u2014 and as Mr. McCain discarded two safer choices, Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, as too predictable \u2014 he turned to Ms. Palin. He had his first face-to-face interview with her on Thursday and offered her the job moments later. </p> </blockquote> <p>Good God. This is the man who's touting his superior judgment? </p> <p>He now has, quite deservedly, a full-fledged disaster on his hands. More things will start dripping out. Moderate voters are off this bandwagon, as polls will begin to affirm. She's there only to placate social conservatives. He dumps her, he infuriates them. He keeps her, he loses massive credibility with non-right voters. He's really stuck.</p> <p>One can almost feel a certain sympathy for him. His instinct to expand the party is decent. But politics is politics. The GOP is first and foremost, in emotional terms, an anti-abortion party. That is the glue, and that's the way it is. He was in dreamland thinking about Lieberman and Ridge. And now he's paying the price for dreaming. He's in a nightmare -- of his own making.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>A million people were left without power in Louisiana and Mississippi last night after Hurricane Gustav tore up the Gulf Coast with 110mph winds and torrential rains. But the biggest fear - that the levees surrounding New Orleans would collapse - did not materialise.</p> <p>As night fell, and curfew went into effect in several towns, a weakened Gustav was moving north-west towards the Texas border. Officials said they expected the weather system to be downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm overnight.</p> <p>In its wake, Gustav killed at least seven people - including an elderly couple who died when a tree crashed through the roof of the Baton Rouge home in which they were sheltering. The other deaths were traffic-related.</p> <p>Power lines were downed across Louisiana, with authorities saying some outages may last for weeks. Half of New Orleans was without power. Rooftops were ripped off. Trees and other debris blocked roads in Lafayette, Baton Rouge and other towns, with people reporting extensive damage to roofs and homes further down the coast.</p> <p>The governor, Bobby Jindal, warned that the state remained at risk of rising floodwaters. \"I don't want anyone having a false sense of hope, it is still too early,\" he told a press conference in Baton Rouge. \"The worst tidal surges may be on the back end of the storm.\"</p> <p>But Louisiana was largely spared the cataclysmic storm that many had feared when Gustav began forming in the Caribbean. Fears of a repeat of Katrina led the Republicans to drastically scale back their nominating convention for John McCain.</p> <p>George Bush and Dick Cheney cancelled their appearances at the convention last night.</p> <p>But an efficient evacuation effort minimised the human cost of the storm.</p> <p>After the horrors of Katrina three years ago, the authorities were determined to move people out of danger. The mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, called Gustav the mother of all storms, sounding an alarm that encouraged all but 10,000 city residents to get out.</p> <p>Across Louisiana, nearly 2m people were moved out of low-lying areas and mobile homes, and put on buses and trains to shelters in other states. Though much of the evacuation was completed on Sunday, Louisiana's governor, Bobby Jindal, told a press conference that the authorities continued to evacuate people until 6am yesterday - just three hours before Gustav made landfall.</p> <p>Bush who watched the storm from Texas praised the effort.</p> <p>\"The coordination on this storm is a lot better than on - than during Katrina,\" he told a press conference.</p> <p>The few who chose to ignore evacuation orders and remain behind fortified their homes by boarding up the windows and putting sandbags beneath their doors.</p> <p>But Gustav, which weakened by the time it made landfall, did much less damage than initially feared. The storm passed to the west of New Orleans, delivering a glancing blow to the city that was devastated by Katrina and flooding three years ago.</p> <p>Water did slop over the top of a levee in the Industrial Canal, which connects the Mississippi to Lake Pontchartrain. But the walls held, unlike three years ago when a breach of the levee sent floodwaters cascading into the low-lying ninth ward. By mid-afternoon, the national guard was reporting that the high water mark had fallen two feet since morning.</p> <p>The storm made landfall around 9.30am local time near the small coastal town of Cocodrie. It roared up through oil industry towns of Houma and Morgan City, passing over Lafayette, the state's fourth-largest city before moving off towards Texas.</p> <p>Along its route, the storm began to lose strength, diminishing in force to a category one hurricane.</p> <p>Officials said tonight they would send teams out to begin to survey the damage at daybreak. But Nagin was hopeful that New Orleans could re-open as early as today, once authorities determine that it is safe for the evacuees to return.</p> <p>\"We are not totally out of the woods, but we are getting close,\" Nagin told reporters last night.</p> <p>Even despite that cautionary note, most people believed that the worst of the storm had passed them by. By late afternoon, they began to venture out in search of ice, or just to see what had happened to their neighbours.</p> <p>Dwight Steven, a bookseller, emerged from his home at about 6pm, plastic cup with rum punch in hand, to take a look at his neighbourhood in Lafayette.</p> <p>He said he did not begrudge the authorities their dire warnings. \"Honestly I really think it was smart. We should be a little bit cautious,\" he said. \"It could have been a lot worse.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sarah Palin today came face-to-face with the hard reality of the media examination she will undergo as John McCain's running mate when she was forced to confirm that her unmarried school-age daughter was pregnant.</p> <p>The revelation immediately renewed questions about the extent to which Palin, Alaska's governor, and relatively unknown before McCain announced her as his vice-presidential choice on Friday, had been vetted.</p> <p>Other disclosures today included that her husband, Todd, was arrested for alleged drunk driving 20 years ago and, more recently, she hired a lawyer to represent her in a state ethics probe.</p> <p>The investigation is over when she dismissed the public safety commissioner, Walt Monegan, after he refused to fire her brother-in-law, a state trooper, who divorced Palin's sister.</p> <p>Palin, the vice-presidential candidate and new star of the Republican party, was in St Paul, Minnesota, today to rally Republican convention delegates after being dispatched by McCain last night. The Republicans are trying to salvage their convention, which has been disrupted by media attention switching to Hurricane Gustav. All convention activities were cancelled for Monday except for essential business.</p> <p>Palin, soon after her arrival, was caught up in questions about her private life. In response, the McCain campaign team issued a statement on her behalf stating that her 17-year-old unmarried daughter, Bristol, is five months pregnant. Palin, who campaigns on a Christian, anti-abortion ticket, said Bristol and her partner planned to marry: \"We're proud of Bristol's decision to have her baby and even prouder to become grandparents.\"</p> <p>The fact that her daughter is to marry and have the baby blunted negative reaction among the party's social conservatives worried about sex before marriage. The news could even help consolidate the image of Palin and her family as typical of the average American home.</p> <p>The emergence of details about Palin's life, partly after reporters landed at her home town, Wasilla, in Alaska, raised concerns about whether the usual vetting had been dispensed with due to McCain's impulsive choice.</p> <p>McCain's team insisted today he had known about the pregnancy, the drunk driving charge and the ethics probe before offering Palin the job. </p> <p>The man who carried out the vetting, Arthur Culvahouse, told Associated Press that all the potential problems uncovered in interviews with Palin had now been made public. \"I think so. Yes. I think so. Correct,\" he said, insisting there had been a \"full and comprehensive\" vetting.</p> <p>But it emerged that McCain sent a fresh team to Alaska after he made the announcement on Friday, a move that raised questions about how thorough the initial vetting had been.</p> <p>On the pregnancy, a McCain spokesman, Steve Schmidt, said the senator's view was that this was \"a private family matter\". He added: \"Life happens.\" <br>Mark Salter, a McCain adviser, said the pregnancy had been announced to rebut rumours from internet bloggers that Palin's son, Trig, born in April with Down's syndrome, was a child of Bristol's. \"An American family,\" Salter said.</p> <p>The appointment of Palin is intended to mark a change in strategy by McCain. Having concluded it was not enough to challenge Barack Obama over his lack of foreign experience and to push his own narrative as a Vietnam war hero, he has been hoping to appeal to the working class and lower middle class, and believes Palin has the right credentials for attracting blue-collar workers.</p> <p>With the absence from the convention of McCain and the US president, George Bush - who had been scheduled to make a prime-time speech last night at the convention but went instead to Texas to be on hand for the Hurricane Gustav emergency centre - Palin, Laura Bush and McCain's wife, Cindy, led the push to raise delegates' spirits.</p> <p>The president's wife, who appealed from the podium for help for hurricane victims rather than make a politically-tinged speech, acknowledged delegates' frustration over the cancelled first day of the four-day convention. \"I know they're disappointed they're not going to get to have the programme tonight, but everyone understands it, everyone is thinking about everybody all across the Gulf coast,\" she told CBS television.</p> <p>All but two hours of the conference were cancelled today. A cocktail party planned for tonight, named Spirits of Minneapolis, was renamed Spirits of the Gulf Coast, with a fundraiser present to help bring in cash for the the American Red Cross hurricane effort.</p> <p>The Republicans are hoping to resume normal business today . As long as they can manage to have three full days of prime-time viewing, finishing as planned on Thursday night, they believe they can secure enough media attention to judge the convention a success.</p> <p>While Hurricane Gustav reminded the public of the failure of Bush to deal with the devastation of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, McCain's campaign team sought to turn the storm to their advantage. The cancellation of the first day of the convention sent out a message that McCain cared, contrasting with Bush's seeming indifference straight after Hurricane Katrina.</p> <p>McCain said on ABC News that he was frustrated at the loss of part of the convention but added: \"This is just one of those moments in history where you have to put America first.\"</p> <p>The hurricane diverted media attention from the Republican convention, with almost all of the anchor journalists from the main networks having flown out to New Orleans. McCain is hoping he can get back media attention for Palin's speech tomorrow and his own on Thursday. Rick Davis, a McCain adviser, said decisions would be taken on a day-to-day basis.</p>",
  "<p>Republican presidential nominee-to-be John McCain raised at least $47m in August, his biggest monthly money total so far and a sign that he is dispelling doubts about his campaign among conservative donors. </p> <p>Two campaign officials discussed the fundraising yesterday on the condition of anonymity because the numbers had not been tallied officially. </p> <p>The amount was just shy of the $50m that Democratic rival Barack Obama raised in July. </p> <p>Obama campaign officials would not comment on their August fundraising. The campaigns do not have to submit their August financial reports to the US federal election commission until September 20. </p> <p>One official said the McCain campaign had raised $10m since the candidate announced on Friday that Alaska Governor Sarah Palin would be his vice-presidential running mate. </p> <p>Palin has emerged as a popular vice-presidential candidate among social conservatives, who have eyed McCain with suspicion. </p> <p>Another official said the Republican party and the campaign will have between $224m and $240m available next week going into the final campaign for the November 4 presidential election. </p> <p>That amount would include the $85m in public money that McCain will receive after he officially becomes the Republican nominee on Thursday. </p> <p>After receiving the federal money, McCain will be prohibited from raising any more money for his campaign. Any cash that is left in his account when he becomes the nominee can be shifted to the Republican national committee or state party committees that have federal accounts set aside to help his campaign. </p> <p>The $47m represents money raised by the campaign and McCain's share of a joint victory fund set up with the Republican party. In July, McCain's last best fundraising performance, he raised $26m. </p> <p>The McCain camp expects the Republican national committee's McCain-Palin Victory '08 fund to raise $100m in September and October, giving the campaign overall access to more than $300m for the fall contest. </p> <p>Obama decided to decline his share of federal money, anticipating he could raise more though private donations. </p> <p>Fundraisers have said he and the Democratic national committee need to raise more than $200m in September and October to stay ahead of McCain and make the decision to reject public funds worthwhile. </p> <p>Obama advisers have said they expected his already record-setting fundraising to have surged during the Democratic National Convention last week and after his acceptance speech at last Thursday.</p>",

They listened as a folksinger strummed songs on a guitar. A Hollywood celebrity arrived to give a moving speech about the war and demand a group hug.</p> <p>But, as thousands of left-wing protestors marched just a few blocks away, this was not just another anti-war demonstration at the Republican convention. This was a pro-war protest.</p> <p>The slogans on the placards gave the game away quickly. \"Let our soldiers win!\" read one. \"Some heroes wear shoes, mine wears combat boots!\" stated another. One man wore a T-shirt with a machine-gun on it and the bold boast: \"We Want Peace Through Superior Firepower.\"</p> <p>The protest was organised by a pro-military group called Families United for Our Troops and Their Mission. Many of its members have children or other family members in the military. Often they have lost their loved ones in the conflicts in Iraq or Afghanistan. But it has not diminished their commitment to a war many other Americans increasingly find unpopular. Debbie Lee is no exception. Her son, Marc Allan Lee, was killed in combat in Iraq in August, 2006. He was the first Navy Seal to die in the war. </p> <p>\"I am here today to support our troops,\" Lee said. \"He believed in fighting this war. He believed in fighting the terrorists over there so we did not have to fight them in America. He died defending me, you and every other American.\" Lee now travels all over America advocating on behalf of fighting war in Iraq to a victorious conclusion.</p> <p>Lee's sentiments were echoed by Hollywood actor (and father of screen siren Angelina Jolie) Jon Voight. Voight, star of films such as Midnight Cowboy and Mission Impossible, cut a dashing figure in a sharp suit as he spoke to the gathering of some 100 or so Families United activists. He slammed other celebrities for joining the anti-war movement or speaking out against the war. </p> <p>\"Celebrity does something to your mind. It drops your IQ. It really does. It distracts you from the truth,\" he said. That truth, according to Voight, is support and praise for the war in Iraq and the men and women who are fighting it. \"They step up to protect our country, the values of this country. They know what they are doing and they are putting their lives on the line,\" Voight said. He said he regretted once being involved in anti-Vietnam war protests in the 1960s. \"I pray to God every day that he will forgive me for that nonsense,\" he said.</p> <p>The protest, held in the shadow of St Paul's huge cathedral, was dwarfed by the thousands of anti-war demonstrators who marched today through St Paul to protest the convention and the war. In stark contrast to the anti-war march, who demanded everything from an immediate pullout of Iraq to the impeachment of president George W Bush, United Families were firmly behind current US policy in Iraq. \"I am proud of Bush. He did not cave in,\" said Lee.</p> <p>But there was no shortage of open emotion on the pro-war side. As Voight finished his speech, after leading a silent prayer for those who had died in the war, his eyes teared up and he paused in his words. \"It's alright!\" several audience members shouted to encourage the weeping actor. \"I really do need that group hug now,\" Voight said and, in immediate response, he was surrounded and embraced by the crowd.</p>",
  "<p>Laura Bush joined forces with Cindy McCain at the cut-down Republican convention in St Paul, Minnesota, today to appeal for cash for victims of Hurricane Gustav.</p> <p>The first lady received a standing ovation when she appeared, as did the would-be first lady when she appeared 10 minutes later.</p> <p>Cindy McCain told delegates that it would not be appropriate to conduct politics at such a time and asked for donations to a special Republican website set up to help with Gulf coast relief. \"This is a time when we take off our Republican hats and put on our American hats,\" she said</p> <p>Although Gustav turned out to have a less devastating impact on America's gulf coast than predicted, Republicans are keen to be seen to be sensitive to the region after the failure of president George Bush to act when New Orleans was flooded in 2005.</p> <p>With almost all of the first day of the convention scrapped, the hall was only a third full. The arrival of Laura Bush and Cindy McCain came as a relief to the delegates after two hours of procedural discussion necessary - for legal reasons - to nominate John McCain the Republican presidential candidate.</p> <p>George Bush was to have been the prime-time speaker at the convention tonight but cancelled to visit the hurricane-hit region. Instead, Laura Bush took to the stage to echo the theme that partisanship had to be put aside at such a time. </p> <p>\"The effect of Hurricane Gustav is just now being measured,\" she said in St Paul, Minnesota. \"When such events occur, we are reminded that first, we are all Americans, and that our shared American ideals will always transcend political parties and partisanship.\"</p> <p>But Bush could not resist making at least one political point, noting that all the gulf state governors were Republicans.</p> <p>Four of the five governors sent taped video messages to the convention. One of them, Rick Perry, of Texas, was pictured against a plane that had flown to Louisiana to help with evacuation and he, like Laura Bush, could not help making a political point too. </p> <p>\"You're seeing Republican governors in Republican states doing a fabulous job of taking care of the citizens,\" Perry said. \"That's what we do.\" </p> <p>Barack Obama also urged hundreds of thousands of supporters to donate to the Red Cross to help victims of Gustav.</p>"
