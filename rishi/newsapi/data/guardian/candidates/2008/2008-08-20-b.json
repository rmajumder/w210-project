  "<p>Olympic sports federations and National Olympic Committees across the world stand to make on average \u00a3750,000 more a year each as a result of London hosting the 2012 Olympics.</p> <p>London's Games are set to raise \u00a3750m more for Olympic sport worldwide than Beijing. With the British Olympic Association groaning under the weight of a seven-figure pre-tax loss last year, the windfall will come as a welcome relief.</p> <p>For the winter-summer Olympic cycle in Turin and Beijing the International Olympic Committee earned less than \u00a31.9bn in combined sponsorship and broadcast revenues. Several major broadcast and commercial deals expire after the Beijing closing ceremony and the IOC's marketing and broadcast executive, Timo Lumme, said it was on course for huge uplift. </p> <p>The IOC reinvests its incomes into sport, with 92% of revenues from the Games going to international federations and National Olympic Committees. It has already struck broadcast deals for London 2012 worth almost \u00a32bn. By also expanding its nine-partner portfolio of top-tier sponsors, such as Coca-Cola, to about a dozen, it expects also to generate another \u00a3600m minimum from sponsors over the next four years. That will generate total broadcast and sponsorship revenue for the IOC of at least \u00a32.7bn, providing Olympic sports with a funding bonanza that will be as welcome at British Olympic HQ as anywhere.</p> <p><strong>China's big screen break</strong></p> <p>China might be topping the medal table at its home Games but the biggest winner here has been its state broadcaster, CCTV. Incredibly, as part of a long-term deal struck in the early 1990s, China pays only a fraction of Asia's $18.5m (\u00a310m) total contribution to broadcast rights. So CCTV has turned a profit of about \u00a3200m in advertising revenues from these Olympics, with not a penny of it going back to sport.<br><strong><br>Getting sums wrong</strong></p> <p>Politicians' lack of perspective over financial issues has been exposed yet again with the government's preposterous announcement that it hopes to raise \u00a379m for British Olympic sport from the private sector. On offer are naming rights for the Olympic facilities but Arsenal, a global brand, receive only \u00a33m a year for title sponsorship of their stadium from Emirates. And government hopes that the marketable Beijing medal-winners will participate in promotional programmes look equally forlorn. Athletes must pay back a pound of their \u00a320,000-plus UK Sport funding for every one they earn over \u00a354,000 in a year. So there is no incentive for them to help swell government coffers when it has already guaranteed all athletes their Olympic funding.<br><strong><br>Twenty20's 2020 bid</strong></p> <p>While the 50-over format continues to writhe in the agonies of its slow death, the International Cricket Council is trying to prepare an Olympic future for its more successful Twenty20 incarnation. The ICC's president, David Morgan, has been in Beijing this week, schmoozing the IOC's members in an effort to win election to the Olympic family in time for the 2020 Games. The former England &amp; Wales Cricket Board chairman has been relying on the ECB's chief executive, David Collier, a board member of the International Hockey Federation, who has full Olympic accreditation.</p> <p><strong>Wiggins' new ride</strong></p> <p>Bradley Wiggins has been a British icon here, winning two gold medals in the track cycling. And he brought typical British values to his celebrations in Beijing, emerging from a reception at the 2012 promotional venue, London House, in the early hours and rolling over the bonnet of a waiting taxi. The driver, understandably, took exception. Although the police intervened, everything was resolved when the driver spotted Wiggins's medals and was granted a photo opportunity with London's cycling ambassador. </p>",
  "<p>As the focus this week turned to Barack Obama's choice of running mate, his other crucial partner continues to show that the Democratic nominee isn't the only Obama breaking down barriers. Michelle Obama is well on her way to becoming the first African-American first lady. But in a country that has a long way to go in terms of racial and gender justice, her reception has been far from warm. In the wake of the rank misogyny directed at Hillary Clinton throughout her campaign, it's time for American feminists to defend Michelle Obama with the same passion and vigour: the attacks are worse and the consequences more dire.</p> <p>Media coverage of Obama has packed a nasty racism-sexism combo that is quickly becoming a national disgrace. First a Fox News segment captioned a picture of Michelle as \"Obama's Baby Mama\", a disparaging term for unmarried mothers. Rightwing commentators have called her an \"angry black woman\" and \"Obama's bitter half\", while the National Review ran a cover story dubbing her \"Mrs Grievance\". Then came the notorious, if satirical, New Yorker cover, where she was featured as having a large Afro and toting a machine gun. </p> <p>Like it or not, it matters what the American public thinks of Michelle Obama. A recent poll showed 61% of Americans say the potential first lady plays a role in how they vote.</p> <p>While there has been positive media - such as Michelle Obama's appearance on TV and on magazine covers - the underlying messages put out by the press reek of racism, sexism, and of a country unable, or unwilling, to see a black woman in a position of power. As one Washington Post commentator, Sophia A Nelson, wrote, for women who face this daily, it is far from shocking. \"We're endlessly familiar with the problem she is confronting - being looked at, as black women, through a different lens from our white counterparts, who are portrayed as kinder, gentler souls who somehow deserve to be loved and valued more than we do.\" </p> <p>Thankfully, this assault isn't going entirely unchecked. Blogs such as Michelle Obama Watch are holding news outlets accountable for inaccurate, sexist and racist characterisations. But that's not enough. It's time for feminists in the mainstream movement, many of whom are still stinging over Clinton's loss, to not just pull out all the stops for Barack, but to also use their considerable political power, money and influence to defend Michelle. </p> <p>When Clinton was still campaigning I received daily emails from various women's organisations, furious about the way the media was treating their candidate. These days, however, my inbox is fairly empty. And the press releases and action alerts I do get about Michelle Obama seem to lack the outrage and fervour of past Clinton-focused statements.</p> <p>That's not to say women's organisations aren't up to the task. The National Organisation for Women, for instance, has shifted the focus of their Media Hall of Shame to attacks on Obama. But feminists should be up in arms. Because as shameful as the treatment they're getting is, our silence is even more so. </p> <p>Michelle Obama recently told a room full of women that \"[we] need an advocate in the White House now more than ever before\". And after eight years of the Bush administration, truer words were never spoken. But Michelle Obama also needs an advocate in us. </p> <p>We have an opportunity to show the world that racism and sexism are not acceptable, that they have no place in public discourse, and that those with power will not just speak out against injustice - but will scream, full volume. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jessica Valenti is the founder of Feministing website and author of Full Frontal Feminism <a href=\"http://www.feministing.com\">feministing.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Election </strong></p> <p>9am &amp; 8.15pm, Sky Movies Indie</p> <p>(Alexander Payne, 1999) This astute, funny comedy about the election of a high-school students' president has a pretty merciless take on voter apathy, vote-rigging and the democratic process. Supervising the campaign is wobbly liberal teacher Matthew Broderick; the star of the show is Reese Witherspoon's corrupt teeny manipulator, Tracy Flick.</p> <p><strong>Flyboys</strong></p> <p>5.30pm, Sky Movies Premiere</p> <p>(Tony Bill, 2006) This first world war movie about the Lafayette Escadrille - the American volunteers who fought with the French air force - is a sort of Biggles-era Top Gun, with James Franco a smouldering hero and Jean Reno the young Yanks' commander. It's weighed down by every war-movie cliche ever, but it's still a dashing, old-fashioned and handsome-looking adventure.</p> <p><strong>Terminator II: Judgment Day</strong></p> <p>9pm, ITV2</p> <p>(James Cameron, 1991) Well, he said he'd be back ...

But this time he's the good guy, defending surrogate family Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong against state-of-the-art Terminator Robert Patrick. The latter's liquid-metal body transformations are eye-boggling, Cameron clearly blowing the extra bucks on state-of-the-art special effects.</p>",
  "<p>Labour MP Ann Cryer announced last night that she would step down from parliament at the next general election. She was elected MP for Keighley in 1997 and has campaigned on issues including forced marriage, domestic violence and honour killings. Cryer was a driving force behind a law enabling courts to intervene in cases of forced marriages which comes into effect next month. The 68-year-old told Labour party members she had decided to stand down \"mainly concerning my age, health and decreasing energy\". Cryer became an MP after the death of her politician husband Bob.</p>",
  "<p>A former Kenyan anti-corruption chief who fled into self-imposed exile in 2005 has returned home with a warning that he has \"unfinished business\". </p> <p>John Githongo, whose efforts to expose massive theft at the highest levels of government had led to death threats, flew into the capital, Nairobi, on Tuesday for a brief visit after being assured of his safety. He was welcomed by Prime Minister Raila Odinga but not President Mwai Kibaki, who is accused of ignoring his reports that government contracts worth \u00a3500m had been signed with mainly fictitious firms. </p> <p>His homecoming has caused a stir in Kenya, where he is seen as a hero by many and a traitor by few. In publicly denouncing the cover-up of the \"Anglo Leasing\" scandal by ministers and Kibaki, Githongo broke the decades-long tradition of top government officials turning a blind eye to corruption, especially when it involved people from the same ethnic group. Like Kibaki, who made him his anti-corruption advisor in 2003, Githongo is a Kikuyu. </p> <p>Githongo is now a senior associate member at St Antony's College in Oxford, and is a vice-president of the aid agency World Vision. But in a speech yesterday there were suggestions he may soon return home permanently. </p> <p>He said it felt \"great to be home\". Alluding to corruption, Githongo said the fight was far from being won and that western countries were not doing enough to help recover stolen funds stashed abroad. An amnesty should be offered to fraudsters who admitted wrongdoing and were willing to pay back the stolen money, he said. He added that his work on the Anglo Leasing case was not complete. </p> <p>Githongo also talked about the politics in Kenya, which is making a slow recovery from the violence that left more than 1,000 people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced earlier this year after Kibaki's controversial election win over Odinga. </p> <p>Githongo described the current coalition government and peace settlement as \"temporary institutions, a lid that covers a range of unresolved issues\". </p> <p>\"I don't think that we can take this peace that we have in this country now for granted, even for one minute,\" said Githongo.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown last night launched a political fightback, brushing aside questions about his leadership and vowing to win the next election.</p> <p>The prime minister suggested there would be no autumn reshuffle and instead hinted that his government would bring forward measures this September to help those hardest hit by the credit crunch.</p> <p>Brown's attempt to reassert his authority follows a summer of dismal byelection defeats, dire poll ratings, criticism of his leadership and speculation over whether he should step down.</p> <p>Speaking to journalists en route to the Beijing Olympics, the prime minister rejected Tory claims that it was impossible for Labour to win the next election, claiming: \"We are going to go on and win.\"</p> <p>He said: \"We are getting on with the job. You will find, as we get into September, that what the people of Britain are concerned about is what's happening to their mortgages, what's happening to their gas and electricity bill, what's happening to oil prices and petrol prices at the pumps. These are the issues they have.</p> <p>\"You will see us dealing with some of these issues when we come back in September.\"</p> <p>Asked about the prospect of an autumn cabinet reshuffle, Brown said he was \"happy with the team\". But he added: \"No one makes advance announcements on things like that. We are concentrating on economic issues.\"</p> <p>Brown brushed aside attacks on his leadership and insisted that relations with the foreign secretary, David Miliband - the man seen as the frontrunner to replace him - were \"fine\".</p> <p>Pressed about whether the foreign secretary should have written a controversial article for the Guardian last month calling for Labour's renewal, Brown said: \"The article he wrote in the Guardian was an article that any member of the cabinet could have written, or I could have written. These are the debates all members of the cabinet have got to be involved in. There is no difficulty with that at all.\"</p> <p>Referring to the foreign secretary as \"Dave\", he said they had been working closely together on the issues of Georgia and Afghanistan. He denied suggestions that he had been slow to respond to Russia's invasion of Georgia, allowing the Tory leader, David Cameron, to eclipse him on the issue, saying he had been involved in behind-the-scenes talks \"from day one\".</p> <p>\"We are trying to give whatever help we can, including talks on reconstruction,\" he said.</p> <p>Brown revealed that he had contacted the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, to express his condolences over the 10 French soldiers killed by the Taliban outside Kabul earlier this week.</p> <p>He said the coalition forces had always expected the terrorists to launch a summer offensive and warned that there may be more \"guerrilla\" attacks in the coming months.</p> <p>The prime minister also made clear that he would use his trip to Beijing to increase pressure on the Chinese authorities over human rights. In a written reply to a letter from the Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, Brown said that \"support for the games and engagement with China is not at the expense of human rights\". </p> <p>\"It is integral to their promotion,\" he wrote.</p>",
  "<p>Who Do You Think You Are? (BBC1) appears like an oasis across the thirsty sands of summer, with Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson as a particularly tasty coconut. </p> <p>The de Pfeffel bit, which always causes such innocent merriment at election counts, turned out to be royal. Which is one in the eye for us.</p> <p>He is a veritable bouillabaisse, a ratatouille, a great cut-and-come-again fruit cake of nations. \"Like Waitrose honey and British sherry, I am the produce of more than one country. Lithuanian, German, French, Alsatian. From Alsace. They weren't dogs. English. </p> <p>Lots of English! Not Scottish or Welsh as far as I know. Not that there's anything wrong with that!\" He accelerates suddenly like a driver getting out of a tight spot, dodging imaginary dangers for comic effect. </p> <p>His great-grandfather was Turkish. Strictly speaking, he is Boris Kemal. As his father, who has had slightly less electoral success, put it: \"If I was Kemal, I might be on the Tory A-list in this new multicultural Britain.\" Ali Kemal, a crusading journalist and conservative politician, was ill-advised enough to lock horns with Ataturk, the father of modern Turkey. You could see they were never going to get along. Ali wore a smart straw boater while Ataturk favoured an intimidating astrakhan tarboosh. When Ataturk took over, Ali was assassinated. According to a contemporary account, \"The crowd set on him and stoned him. Several people stabbed him. He fell on the ground, blood pouring out of his head and face. The crowd set on his body, stealing whatever valuables he had on him, his gold watch, his ring and even his trousers. Then the body was hung on a tree.\" At this point Boris's Beano-isms \"Wow-ee!\" \"Cripes!\" and \"Stone the crows!\" dried up and did not reappear. Looking at his great-grandfather dangling from a gibbet in his longjohns, he just said \"Blast!\" under his breath. </p> <p>This gave him some chewy food for thought on the subject of mixing journalism with politics. \"The first duty of a columnist is to be read - punchy, pol-emical. Whether it is politically safe is a different question.\" His lips twitched.</p> <p>His grandfather never spoke of his father. His grandmother, on the other hand, never stopped talking about her aristocratic forebears, the de Pfeffels, to the hilarity of her grandchildren, who had turned out to be a litter of golden labradors. We were getting closer to the source of that strong blond gene. </p> <p>Her ancestor Caroline de Pfeffel (or as Boris described her from her miniature \"old blond ringlets here\") was the daughter of an actress. \"Actress may be a euphemism for prostitute,\" he said with some gusto. \"Not that I mind! My ancestors have carte blanche to commit whatever acts of fornication they want. But I want to know.\"</p> <p>She was five months pregnant when she married Charles de Pfeffel. \"Why does Charles marry Caroline? She's six years older than him. She's pregnant. They all got together and they put the hard word on de Pfeffel and said, 'Do the right thing!' and he said, 'Oh, God! OK.' And they said, 'It'll be fine! It's all gonna run on rails. We're gonna have a wedding. You'll love it. You won't feel a thing.' That's what they told Charles. Whose interests are at stake here? Who's got their tits in the wringer?\" </p> <p>I must say that, as flights of fancy go, this spirited scenario sounded pretty much like first-hand reportage to me. </p> <p>Meticulous German records proved him right. Caroline was the illegitimate daughter (\"Stick with it, folks! Ich habe der mystery der cracked!\") of Prince Paul of W\u00fcrttemberg (\"A 200-year-old scandal! Superb!\"). Prince Paul evidently squeezed de Pfeffel until his pips squeaked, and the King of W\u00fcrttemberg chipped in with a silver tea set, presumably as a wedding present. This was the legendary de Pfeffel silver. \"The gag was that anyone who bore the name de Pfeffel would inherit the family silver. Tragically, when I was about 16 they flogged it.\" </p> <p>Boris is related, through Prince Paul's Hanoverian mother, to absolutely all European royalty. \"I have always dimly suspected this,\" he (you can't avoid the word) chortled. And, therefore, also related to David Cameron, another by-blow of the royal family. </p> <p>\"My excuse for this gross exercise in narcissism is that it is interesting how British I feel and yet what a mongrel composition I really am.\" </p> <p>Saying which, he left to \"Hoover up the other thrones of Europe\".</p> <p>The House of Saddam (BBC2) ended with his sons dead and his house shrunken to a hole in the ground. Buried alive, he crouched there, gasping for air, flicking a faulty cigarette lighter as American troops crashed and rampaged overhead. Spreadeagled in the dust, his last words were magnificently hubristic: \"I am Saddam Hussein. I am the president of Iraq. I am prepared to negotiate.\"</p>",
  "<p>B as in bounce, as in convention bounce: Joe Klein has <a href=\"http://www.time-blog.com/swampland/2008/08/going_second.html\">a good post</a> at Swampland discussing, among other things, the likely effect of the conventions being back-to-back this year, which is the first time this has happened in my memory.</p> <p>Klein notes that the party that goes second historically gets a bigger bounce. True enough. It's like a home-field advantage in sports. But this year, perhaps even more so, because as soon as the Dems finish, media attention turns to the Reps. McCain's plan to announce his vice-presidential choice next Friday (the day after the Dem convention closes) means that the story will shift immediately back from Obama to McCain.</p> <p>So one question that arises from this is: What does Obama have planned for after the convention? Just a conventional (so to speak) week of campaigning won't cut the mustard. He ought to do something creative. What's the 2008 equivalent of the famous 1992 Bill Clinton-Al Gore bus tour? I'm not sure what it is, but I'm not paid to come up with it. But if Obama completes a reasonably successful convention, or even wildly successful, and then the next week is dominated by the GOP convention (which will be an Obama smackfest), McCain will get a decent bounce and Obama will enter the home stretch behind for the first time in ages.</p>",
  "<p>As Democrats prepare to woo the American west at their presidential convention in Colorado next week, John McCain is making headlines of his own with remarks on the state's water supply.</p> <p>McCain said the 1922 Colorado River compact, which parcels out dwindling water resources to the arid western states, should be \"renegotiated\" in light of \"greater demands on a scarcer resource\".</p> <p>\"Conditions have changed dramatically, so I'm not saying that anyone would be forced to do anything \u2026 but at the same time, there's already been discussion among the [western] states,\" McCain told Colorado's Pueblo Chieftain newspaper on Friday.</p> <p>The suggestion of renegotiation might sound harmless to non-westerners. But in Colorado \u2013 a pivotal swing state where McCain and Barack Obama are virtually tied \u2013 water rights is an explosive issue.</p> <p>The 86-year-old water compact carved the Colorado River into sections. The water-rich \"upper basin\" states of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming provided 7.5m acre-feet of the river's water flow to the \"lower basin\" states, where water was in shorter supply.</p> <p>The lower basin, which includes populous California and Nevada, grew steadily thirstier during the 20th century. Decades of unsavoury water grabs and political scandals over water diversion fuelled tension between the upper and lower regions.</p> <p>\"On a year in, year out basis, there's probably no issue more important to the west than water,\" John Straayer, a political science professor at Colorado State University, said. \"You've got to be very careful with it. It's terribly sensitive for obvious reasons.\"</p> <p>McCain's nod to renegotiation fell particularly flat in Colorado because his home state of Arizona is also in the upper basin, meaning that any alterations to the water compact would likely benefit his constituents.</p> <p>\"It'll spark problems in Colorado when someone in Arizona talks about revisiting things,\" Seth Masket, an assistant politics professor at the University of Denver and an Obama backer, said.</p> <p>\"That's generally interpreted as meaning that Arizona wants more of Colorado's water.\"</p> <p>Indeed, McCain's vow that he \"would never \u2026 damage the state of Colorado's rights over the water\" did little to reassure those who suspected the presidential hopeful could be advocating a water grab.</p> <p>The local newspaper in Fort Collins, a swing city in Colorado, called McCain's comments \"an eyebrow-raiser, at the very least\", adding, \"In a purple state like Colorado, Republicans can't afford those\".</p> <p>One columnist for the Denver Post newspaper was harsher, telling McCain to \"forget about\" winning Colorado in the election: \"We don't vote for water rustlers [thieves] in this state; we tar and feather them!\"</p> <p>Mark Udall, a Democratic congressman running for Senate in Colorado, told reporters that while he and McCain are friends, \"on this issue, he couldn't be more wrong\".</p> <p>Udall's Republican opponent, Bob Schaffer, condemned McCain's proposed water renegotiation in six words. \"Over my cold, dead political carcass,\" Schaffer said.</p> <p>Straayer, of Colorado State University, said McCain's remarks were especially puzzling because western states concluded a new round of talks on the water compact just last year.</p> <p>\"For McCain to suggest, particularly on the heels of last year's renegotiation of the compact, that we keep talking about it \u2013 whatever he meant, it struck me as more than just a small misstep,\" Straayer said.</p> <p>As McCain's water remarks ricocheted across the state, his advisers appeared to recognise the potential for political harm. Colorado was selected to host the Democratic convention next week in no small part because Obama hopes to prevail there in November.</p> <p>Mitt Romney, McCain's former rival in the presidential race and a leading contender for his vice-presidential nod, appeared on Denver's local NBC news station to distance the Arizona senator from the controversy.</p> <p>\"Senator McCain has no interest in reopening the compact,\" Romney said today. \"Senator McCain believes as I do that a compact that's been worked out between the governors and between the states is the right way to go.\"</p> <p>Whether the issue continues to haunt McCain will likely depend on how strongly Democrats emphasise it during the remainder of the campaign. Environmentalists have begun questioning the Republican nominee's water priorities in light of his stated commitment to combating climate change.</p> <p>\"Scientists have predicted a 10 to 30% reduction of water flow in the Colorado River due to long-term drought and higher temperatures associated with climate change,\" Rob Smith, southwest regional director of the Sierra Club, observed.</p> <p>\"Instead of threatening a diminishing resource,\" Smith warned McCain, \"it would be better to help states and communities with water conservation projects and stream restoration.\"</p>",
  "<p>One extremely interested observer in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">war between Russia and Georgia</a> hasn't vocally taken sides in the conflict. Given the war's timing, you might call this country's interest \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 in the conflict \"sporting\". But in reality, Georgia versus Russia provides a convenient simulation for this great power's options of dealing with the western backed irritant on its own perimeter.</p> <p>Beyond the combatants and other former Soviet Republics, no nation is more interested in the Russia-Georgia conflict's global fallout than China. China's relationship with Taiwan resembles Russia's ties to Georgia. In both situations, the big state feels a sense of grievance over the very existence of its puny neighbour and resents outsiders that act as its self-appointed protectors.</p> <p>The Caucuses conflict offers China a realistic model for what it can expect if it the Taiwan situation turns violent. The parallels aren't perfect, but there's a close enough fit for China to pay very close attention, particularly to the international consequences of Russia's humiliation of Georgia. With China watching, the US and it allies need to get their response to Russia absolutely right.</p> <p>The crisis may have its roots in a failure to communicate. Georgia and its president Mikheil Saakashvili may have grossly overestimated the west's commitment to defending its borders and interests. Saakashvili may have equated the west's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/20/georgia.nato?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront\">promise of Nato membership</a> with mutual defence benefits. Or, at least, Saakashvili may have believed that Russia believed the west would fight for Georgia. Although the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0808/Obama_also_cites_NATO_membership_for_Georgia.html\">US insists Georgia is still a candidate for Nato</a>, it's now comedic or criminal to imagine putting a Georgian finger on the trigger to set American, British, French, German and other European troops firing on Russian forces. </p> <p>Shift the focus to Taiwan, an island that China considers a renegade province, and the proposition seems equally ludicrous, while the scope for miscalculation appears similarly broad. America has been purposely vague about what it would do in the event of a mainland military threat to Taiwan and its 23 million people. A dozen years ago, China conducted <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis\">missile tests in the Taiwan Strait</a> ahead of Taiwan's first presidential election. As unbelievable as that seems, it's even more incredible to recall that the US sent an aircraft carrier group warning China to back off.</p> <p>Today Taiwan is a de facto separate country, while China claims it's still part of the nation. Keeping the peace relies on both governments preserving the status quo: China won't attempt reunification by force, and Taiwan won't move toward official independence. Within those rules, everyone trades and invests together peacefully. But rules are made to be broken, and even if nobody explicitly crosses the line, ticklish situations can arise. For example, China could decide that Taiwan's ambition to join the World Trade Organisation constitutes a move toward independence.</p> <p>When Russian foreign minister <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080814/pl_afp/georgiarussiaconflictus_080814093918\">Sergey Lavrov urged the US to choose</a> between \"support for a virtual project\" in Georgia and its \"real partnership\" with Russia on key issues such as nuclear negotiations with Iran and North Korea, he could have been China's foreign minister Yang Jiechi speaking about the US, China and Taiwan. The unprecedented turnout of world leaders for the Olympics in Beijing indicates that the global establishment desperately wants \"real partnership\" with China. It's hard to imagine that Taiwan would be allowed to interfere. </p> <p>Deepened economic ties between the US, EU and China over the past decade mean all sides have more to lose in a conflict. While moving toward a consumer economy, China still remains heavily dependent on exports to developed countries. Developed economies depend on China for cheap goods to meet consumer demand while controlling inflation and maximising corporate profits. With bricks and mortar investment in the mainland, western companies would risk expropriation in the event of a crisis. China also holds trillions of dollars in US Treasury securities, which it could dump on the market to depress US bond prices and raise Uncle Sam's financing costs. A fire sale of Treasury notes would cost China dearly, so the holding acts as a sort of financial mutual suicide pact neither side wants to test.</p> <p>Russia's huge energy reserves may give it even greater economic leverage than China, especially over Europe. Therefore Russia may get off a little easier than China would for its military excesses. If the US and EU show spine despite this leverage, then China can expect to pay a bigger price.</p> <p>China will particularly be watching threats to punish Russia in international organisations and institutions, where China participates more deeply than Russia. While Russia hopes to join the WTO, China entered it in 2001, boosting foreign investment exponentially and making economic reform seem irreversible. Sanctions would be embarrassing, but also potentially harmful to investment and trade. </p> <p>\"If Russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in Georgia, the US-Russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come,\" US defence secretary <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/15/world/europe/15policy.html\">Robert Gates warned</a> last Thursday. That's tough talk, but so far, there's only been talk and empty ceasefire proposals as Russia has advanced beyond disputed territory into Georgia proper. There's \"no prospect\" of US military intervention, Gates added emphatically. The Russians are writing the script here. The US and EU are in no position to edit it, and it would be hard for China not to notice. </p> <p>Russia benefits because the US is involved in two wars already and has neither the troops nor the stomach for a third. China may be tempted to act soon, while US commitments and its need for China's help on North Korea and other issues are great. But the US can still muster more than blankets and cots in response to aggression.</p> <p>Today's signing of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,,-7738829,00.html\">US-Poland agreement on missile defence</a> and mutual defence is a reminder that the US has some weapons to counter Russian ambitions. For China, it's a reminder that assertiveness on Taiwan will trigger reactions from its neighbours. The two biggest neighbours, US allies Japan and South Korea, have long histories of hostility toward China. Additionally, other countries on its flanks, including Southeast Asia could be spooked by military action in Taiwan. Imagine Vietnam reopening the naval base at Cam Rahn Bay to its old enemy the US in response to China's belligerence. </p> <p>The most hopeful sign of avoiding a replay of the Georgian war between China and Taiwan is warming cross-strait relations, particularly since Ma Ying-jeou took office as Taiwan's president in May. The better the two sides get along, the less likely outsiders can tempt either side to throw a spanner into the works. The outcome in Georgia will illustrate the cost of miscalculation. </p> <p>If Russia humiliates Georgia at little cost, it could inspire China to press Taiwan when the opportunity beckons. Taiwan's allies, like Georgia's, are eager to remain friends with the big player neighbour and not eager for a fight. If the current sunshine over the Taiwan Strait gives way to clouds, that could drive the little player to do something desperate, as Georgia did, before it loses whatever leverage it has, and China to take advantage of the opening.</p> <p>To avoid a replay, the US need to show Taiwan and China that it wants to be a dependable friend to each, but that friendship depends on following the rules. That means Russia and Georgia both have to pay a price for their misadventure in the Caucuses. Otherwise, Taiwan will pay a far bigger one.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown today brushed aside questions about his leadership and vowed that Labour would win the next election.</p> <p>The prime minister said there would be no autumn reshuffle, instead hinting that his government would bring forward a package of measures in September to help those hardest hit by the credit crunch.</p> <p>Brown's attempt to reassert his authority followed a summer of dismal byelection defeats, dire poll ratings, increased criticism of his leadership and continued speculation over whether he should step down.</p> <p>Speaking to journalists as he travelled to the Olympics, the prime minister rejected Tory claims that it was now impossible for Labour to win the next election.</p> <p>\"We are going to go on and win,\" he said. \"We are getting on with the job. </p> <p>\"You will find, as we get into September, that what the people of Britain are concerned about is what's happening to their mortgages, what's happening to their gas and electricity bills, what's happening to oil prices and petrol prices at the pumps. </p> <p>\"These are the issues they want us to address and look at. You will see us dealing with some of these issues when we come back in September.\"</p> <p>Asked about the prospect of an autumn Cabinet reshuffle, Brown said he was \"happy with the team\", but added: \"No one makes advance announcements on things like that. We are concentrating on economic issues.\"</p> <p>He insisted that relations between himself and the foreign secretary, David Miliband - the man seen as the front-runner to replace him - were \"fine\".</p> <p>Questioned about whether the foreign secretary should have written an article for the Guardian last month, calling for Labour's renewal, Brown said it \"was an article that any member of the Cabinet could have written, or I could have written\". </p> <p>\"These are the debates all members of the Cabinet have got to be involved in,\" he added. \"There is no difficulty with that at all.\"</p> <p>Referring to the foreign secretary as \"Dave\", he said the pair had been working closely together on the issues of Georgia and Afghanistan. </p> <p>He denied suggestions he had been too slow to respond to Russia's invasion of Georgia, saying he had been involved in behind the scenes talks to resolve the situation \"from day one\".</p> <p>The prime minister also made it clear that he would use his trip to Beijing to increase pressure on the Chinese authorities over the country's human rights record.</p> <p>In a written reply to a letter from the Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, on the issue, Brown said \"support for the Games and engagement with China is not at the expense of human rights. It is integral to their promotion.\" </p> <p>He will be accompanied by his wife Sarah, and their two sons, four-year-old John and Fraser, two, on his visit to the Games.</p> <p>Hailing Britain's stunning achievements at the Olympics so far, he added that he hoped he and his family would be able to see some diving, canoeing, football and athletics relays while they are in China.</p>",
  "<p>I don't normally make it through to Richard Kay's society column in the Daily Mail, but I did today and I learnt something new: <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1047119/Two-Jags-wont-leap-Lords.html\">John Prescott won't take a seat in the House of Lords</a>.</p> <p>Why is that interesting? Only because it was widely assumed that he would take a peerage. </p> <p>As anyone who dealt with him during his 10-year stint as deputy PM will tell you, Prescott always had a very acute sense of status, bordering on obsession. And (although I haven't got a copy to hand, so I can't check the exact quote), in his autobiography Prezza he certainly did not rule out elevation to the upper house.</p> <p>But now he has. This is what he told Kay, or at least one of Kay's minions:</p> <blockquote> <p>I don't want to be a member of the House of Lords. I will not accept it. My wife Pauline would quite like me to accept it, but why should I be sidelined to the Lords when I could do so much more for the Labour movement?</p> <p>\"Being a lord is not for three years or four years, it is for life. There are other things I want to get involved in. People think already that I have retired from public life - I haven't. I am still an MP and after that I still want to make a contribution.</p> </blockquote> <p>Good.</p>",
  "<p>Suppose you are an observant but not particularly devout American Catholic. You go to Mass on Sundays and those holy days that you remember. You don't eat meat on Lenten Fridays - though how you curse it. You feel guilty about not going to confession more often. You fish money out of your pockets during most offerings and usually give to the bishop's appeal.</p> <p>Your faith may not move mountains, but it's real, and you take the obligations of your religion seriously. While you're not wild about all the particulars of Church teaching, you don't doubt that it's true. How will you vote in this election? How should you vote?</p> <p>Demographically, the first answer is easy. If you're a regular Mass-attending Catholic, you're <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-06-02-religion-gap_x.htm\">highly likely to vote for the generic Republican candidate</a> for Congress and president. Catholics are a sliver to the left of Republicans on fiscal issues, but abortion seals the deal.</p> <p>Why? Because there is the sense among the faithful that, at a minimum, one's vote should not increase the odds of one winding up in hell. The Democrats are the party of abortion-on-demand, and the Church teaches that abortion is a grievous sin. Best not to take any chances.</p> <p>Catholic liberals have tried to challenge this assumption, without much success. Social justice issues are said to be as important as abortion. \"How can the Church work so hard to protect the unborn but care so little about government provision for the born?\" sputters one familiar straw man.</p> <p>Or <a href=\"http://www.catholic.org/politics/story.php?id=28726\">\"prudential judgment\"</a> is trotted out to explain why it's OK to vote for politicians who are \"personally opposed\" to abortion but want to keep it widely available, and maybe even publicly funded.</p> <p>Most Mass-going Catholics don't buy it. They're apt to agree with the prudential judgment of groups like the fraternal organisation the <a href=\"http://www.kofc.org/\">Knights of Columbus</a>. At their annual convention this year, the Knights didn't just condemn abortion generically but <a href=\"http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=13693\">called out fellow Catholic politicians</a> who support a practice the Church calls clear grounds for excommunication.</p> <p>The Church believes in a hierarchy of evil, which has stark political implications. It means that certain issues are intrinsically more important than others. So long as it's legal and widely available in the US, abortion will always trump social justice issues, even if the other issues might be worthy causes.</p> <p>But is there an issue that abortion might not be able to trump? Yes there is, and it could spell doom for the Republicans.</p> <p>The issue that could trip up the GOP is war. The Vatican doesn't preach pacifism, but it does expect nations to observe the principles of just war that were developed by doctors of the Church and partially incorporated into international law.</p> <p>Before one nation goes to war with another, it must have a clear and legitimate cause. Absent the threat of imminent attack, it must first seek to resolve the conflict in a way that avoids bloodshed. America took <a href=\"http://www.reason.com/news/show/32570.html\">great pains to observe just war principles in Afghanistan</a> and then inexplicably threw them out some state department window in Iraq.</p> <p>The Pope and his predecessor warned against this. John Paul II sent Cardinal Pio Laghi as an emissary to the White House who <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-03-05-bush-catholic_x.htm\">explained that the US invasion of Iraq would be \"illegal\" and \"unjust\"</a>. Benedict XVI, then head of the teaching office of the Church, <a href=\"http://blog.nj.com/ledgerarchives/2008/03/for_pope_and_president_a_chasm.html\">said</a> that the \"concept of a 'preventive war' does not appear in the Catechism of the Catholic Church\", with good reason.</p> <p>Moreover, the presidential primaries produced candidates that make this election difficult for chagrined churchgoers, because they only amplify the worst tendencies of their respective parties.</p> <p>Senator Barack Obama has voted against affording protections even to premature babies that are accidentally delivered during abortions, for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/08/uselections2008.barackobama\">fear that it might set a precedent</a> that could prevent even one partial-birth abortion at some point.</p> <p>Senator John McCain championed an unjust war in Iraq during his first run for president, was its biggest cheerleader in Congress, <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/news/archives/2007/04/20/bomb_bomb_bomb_bomb_bomb_iran.html\">sings songs about bombing other countries</a> and has adopted a belligerent posture toward much of the rest of the world. More unjust wars would be almost guaranteed on his watch.</p> <p>With <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYCMxD4pylM\">apologies to The Simpsons</a>, that makes this an election of abortions for some, small unjust wars for others. For Catholics who take Church teaching seriously, that's no choice at all.</p>",
  "<p>Sudan's president today denied his regime was involved in genocide in Darfur as he made his first trip abroad since the international criminal court moved to indict him for war crimes. </p> <p>Speaking in Turkey, Omar al-Bashir, said: \"Genocide like the International Criminal Court claims is non-existent\" and claimed the death toll in the indictment of 300,000 black Africans since 2003 was inflated. </p> <p>\"If [those figures] were accurate, there needs to mass graves. Where are those graves?\" he asked.</p> <p>The ICC prosecutor filed 10 charges of war crimes against Bashir last month and asked a panel of judges to issue a warrant for his arrest.<br> Abdullah Gul, Turkey's president, yesterday urged Sudan to take responsibility for Darfur and to end the harsh conditions suffered by its people.  Bashir is accused of directing the Janjaweed militia against black African groups and civilians. </p> <p>Sudan's government denies any ties with the Janjaweed militia with Bashir labelling them \"thieves and gangsters\". The government does, however, admit to mobilising \"self-defence militias\" in order to control rebel attacks. <br> The Sudan People's Liberation Movement \u2013 a former rebel group now in a unity government with Bashir - has urged the president to hand over certain Sudanese officials as concessions to push away the court's allegations. Bashir, however, asserts that his administration does not recognise the court. There are further fears that the recent condemnation from the ICC could put pressure on the delicate 2005 peace deal in Sudan and lead the country back into civil war. Bashir claims that this is the objective of western governments who want greater access to Sudan's resources. \"Some forces who are targeting Sudan's resources are encouraging fighting in Sudan and want her to be divided,\" he said today.  In Istanbul, al-Bashir offered hope that the violence in Darfur will end, promising Sudan's first ever free and democratic elections for next year.  </p>",
  "<p>Always useful, here in the Liberal Media, to be reminded of the fact that that John McCain guy might actually win the presidency: he emerges from a <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/news/elections/1117409,elexpoll082008.article\">new Reuters/Zogby poll</a> with a five-point lead over Obama nationally, at 46% to 41%, the first time he's taken the lead in this monthly poll. To the usual caveats -- it's a long time until the election, and national polls don't mean much at any point anyway, because of the electoral college system -- should be added another, which is that Zogby's polls don't have a fantastic recent record in terms of predicting what actually ends up happening. (The firm's polling methods have been criticised in the past, and as Greg Sargent <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/08/poll_mccain_takes_national_lea.php\">notes</a>, McCain's huge lead over Obama on the economy specifically -- nine points -- is frankly suspicious.) But none of that means Zogby's necessarily wrong to put McCain in front. John Zogby reckons:</p> <blockquote> There is no doubt the campaign to discredit Obama is paying off for McCain right now. This is a significant ebb for Obama. </blockquote> <br> <p>Meanwhile, on that point about the electoral college: <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0808/McCain_takes_lead_in_electoral_college_measure.html\">Ben Smith notes</a> that McCain has also taken his first lead in the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/maps/obama_vs_mccain/?map=10\">roundup of state-by-state polls</a> compiled by RealClearPolitics, which could prove far more significant. The main solace for Obama in all this, of course, is that the coming vice-presidential announcements and conventions mean that polls right now are going to become pretty swiftly irrelevant: we're about to have two weeks full of limitless opportunities for smart moves, cleverly choreographed announcements, and horrible gaffes.</p> <p>Still, after this poll, one can only imagine how far McCain's ratings are going to shoot through the roof when he selects Michael Phelps as his running-mate.</p> <p>UPDATE: Links fixed.</p>",
  "<p>The following is from a <a href=\"http://www.thedemocraticstrategist.org/ac/2008/08/how_to_attack_john_mccainwhat.php#more\">post </a>by James Vega over at the Democratic Strategist, a blog run by the sagacious Ed Kilgore that I recommend highly. Vega suggests the following hypothetical script for an ad that would attack McCain on character:</p> <blockquote> <p>John McCain says this election is about character \u2013 and he's right. <br>In the 2000 presidential race the Bush campaign \u2013 led by Karl Rove \u2013 viciously attacked John McCain's wife and child \u2013 they said his wife was a drug addict and that the child he and his wife adopted from an orphanage was actually his illegitimate Black daughter. On election night, his wife was in tears. </p> <p>Back then, McCain was disgusted. He said there was \"a special place in hell\" for rumormongers like these people. He made a promise to his family and to his supporters that he would never run a dirty campaign like that. Never.</p> <p>But early this year John McCain hired Charlie Condon, the very same man who was behind those vicious smears to run his South Carolina campaign. And then several weeks ago he brought Steven Schmidt - leading prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Karl Rove and master of the political hit job - on board to be his campaign manager and write the talking points for the new negative campaign against Barak Obama.</p> <p>It's sad to watch, McCain's willingness to humiliate himself by hiring the same gang of people who horribly insulted him and his family. It shows that he has become so desperate to win this election that he is willing to sacrifice his principles and his personal honor in order to do it</p> <p>Let's face it. A real man would have said to those people \u2013 \"Get the hell out of my office before I throw you out\" the minute they walked in. A person would not have to be a tough guy like John Wayne to say that. A gentle, decent man of character would have told them the same thing.</p> <p>But what did John McCain say about Bush's dirty politics gang?</p> <p>He said: \"I had to get over it \u2026 it was a long time ago\"</p> <p>It's sad, genuinely sad<br>.<br>John McCain \u2013 he's no longer the man he used to be.</p> </blockquote> <p>I have quibbles with the text here and there, but basically, this is the kind of thing I'm talkin' about. </p>",

Click on the link to read the story and see the ad.</p> <p>It's not a bad ad. It's a start. But it's still pretty squishy if you ask me. Again, to repeat what I said yesterday: Democrats attack on issues, and Republicans attack on character. There's nothing in this ad about McCain's character. It just says he doesn't understand regular people's concerns.</p> <p>Fine. But that isn't tough. If Republicans made this ad about a Democrat, it would have added a character element. For example: \"Maybe the reason he doesn't understand your concerns is that he lives in 10 different homes with a total value of $20 million.\" See? Character! Not issues.</p> <p>I really thought Democrats understood this by now. But there's obviously still a long way to go.</p>",
