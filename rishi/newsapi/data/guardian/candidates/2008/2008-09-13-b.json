  "<p>However you look at it, Robert Mugabe is getting away with murder. The power-sharing deal he is expected to sign tomorrow with his arch-rival, Morgan Tsvangirai, will protect Zimbabwe's president and his cohorts from prosecution for their bloody campaign of killings and terror against opposition supporters and their leaders.</p> <p>Mugabe will remain president, even though his claim of winning 90 per cent of the valid votes in June's election was met with universal scorn after Tsvangirai pulled out because he did not want people killed going to vote for him. </p> <p>The last time Zimbabwe's voters had a chance to cast a ballot without a gun to their heads, in the first round of presidential elections in March, Tsvangirai won. And that was with millions of opposition voters in exile and a good deal of other kinds of intimidation by the ruling Zanu-PF party.</p> <p>Now Mugabe will sit at the head of a cabinet half filled with men responsible for robbing Tsvangirai of that victory by murdering, beating and terrorising the supporters - and sometimes the families - of the other half of the cabinet. When they weren't doing that, they were looting the central bank, stealing land and driving the economy into the ground through incompetence and cynicism, leaving millions on the brink of starvation.</p> <p>So an agreement that persuades the opposition to recognise Mugabe as president and keeps Zanu-PF's killers and looters out of jail might be viewed as a great victory for the old man. Yet the historic deal holds the elements to dismantle Mugabe's 28-year rule and reduce the power of the only leader Zimbabwe has known until a clean election can be held.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, Movement for Democratic Change leaders are calling the agreement a watershed. Some quietly realise that Monday could mark the end of their struggle to finish Zanu-PF's abusive and sometimes violent political domination - the second liberation struggle, as one put it - and the beginning of the equally demanding challenge to take control of government. </p> <p>If they can pull it off - and, in many ways, whether they succeed or fail lies within the MDC's control, not Zanu-PF's - then Mugabe's pledge that Tsvangirai would never rule Zimbabwe, and his bloody strategy to try to ensure it did not happen, will ultimately have failed.</p> <p>It is a complex arrangement, but the nuts and bolts of the agreement are that while Mugabe is president, Tsvangirai has day-to-day control of government as prime minister and head of a council of ministers. That is a considerable asset, even though many of his ministers will be from Zanu-PF. Tsvangirai will run the council of ministers without Mugabe present, but will sit in the cabinet chaired by the president. </p> <p>Crucially, the two MDC factions have a majority of one in both bodies, as well as control of parliament, allowing the party to out-vote Mugabe and set policy. That will allow the MDC to dismantle the apparatus of repression which helped keep Mugabe in power long after his popularity crumbled. The government will be able to abolish legislation banning newspapers, locking up journalists and imposing severe restrictions on freedom of speech. </p> <p>Tsvangirai is counting on the support of civil servants and others, who, like most middle-class urbanites, have long backed the MDC but have been afraid to say so in public. The devil may be in the detail, which won't be made public until after the agreement is signed, but Tsvangirai's aides say there are no hidden trip wires.</p> <p>Much will also depend on the division of ministries, which the two leaders were wrangling over yesterday. Mugabe is expected to keep his hands on the military through a Zanu-PF defence minister, which the MDC can live with because it will help reassure the generals. Tsvangirai has pressed hard for control of the police, which is crucial if he hopes to assure people that they can vote as they wish in future elections. Both sides are pressing to run the justice ministry, but that may be one that Tsvangirai loses because of fears within Zanu-PF that if he controls the police and the justice system the MDC could hold the guilty to account.</p> <p>Crucially, the MDC is likely to get the finance portfolio because foreign donors will not want to hand money over to a Zanu-PF minister. It is the prospect of that money that unlocked the prospect of agreement. Without power for Tsvangirai there will be no foreign aid, and without hard currency Mugabe had no means of turning around an imploding economy.</p> <p>The numbers are staggering. Inflation is running above 20 million per cent a year. Unemployment is 80 per cent. A quarter of the population has left to look for work in South Africa and Britain.</p> <p>The central bank knocked ten zeros off the Zimbabwe dollar at the beginning of last month because shops and banks could not cope with calculations in the trillions. When it was launched on 1 August, the new dollar was Z$4 to the pound, but the black market immediately offered Z$25. Since then, the currency has crashed so fast that the black market rate is Z$13,000 to the pound. The new banknotes are worthless and the government does not have the means to print new money. Last week, it announced that it would legalise the use of US dollars and South African rand, although these are already the de facto currencies.</p> <p>This weekend, there were long queues for petrol after the pipeline from Mozambique was shut down over unpaid bills. Outside the cities, chronic malnutrition is on the way to becoming starvation. The World Food Programme says it will have to feed up to five million Zimbabweans in the coming months.</p> <p>The new government will be desperate to see foreign money soon, so that Tsvangirai can show he can deliver some relief to a distressed population. But Western governments have said they want to wait and see if Tsvangirai is really wielding power, fearing that he may have been duped into a deal that allows Mugabe to outmanoeuvre him. </p> <p>However, this will be a hard position for Britain and others to maintain. They face being accused of neo-colonialism if they fail to embrace what is being billed as an African solution to an African problem and endorsed by all the major political players in Zimbabwe. </p> <p>Whether Tsvangirai actually does hold power will depend in large part on whether he can form a working relationship with the leader of the smaller breakaway faction of his party, Arthur Mutambara. That may prove too much for the two leaders who have not always put the country above personal or political interests.</p> <p>Mutambara, a scientist, has scorned Tsvangirai as ill-educated and an incompetent political leader. Meanwhile, Tsvangirai's followers see Mutambara as a political opportunist out for personal gain. Their fears have been reinforced by his willingness to play footsie with Zanu-PF because, although the Mutambara faction only won 8 per cent of the vote in the election, it holds the balance of power both in parliament and the cabinet. </p> <p>But Mutambara has been reined in by his own MPs and will have to be careful not to overplay his hand. If he is seen by the voters to be extending Mugabe's grip they will make him and his MPs pay at the next election.</p> <p>Although Mugabe and Zanu-PF will attempt to widen the divisions between the MDC factions and buy off its ministers, the MDC's future is in its own hands. If it puts the people before self-interest, and Tsvangirai and Mutambara can set aside their deep personal animosity, then it can set the agenda and transform Zimbabwe. Mugabe will not be without power, but he may be reduced to obstructing more than governing. He could probably bring down the new administration, but he is also only signing the agreement in the first place because he has no other options.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a coalition government is likely to change the political equation for good. Power sharing worked well in smoothing the transition from white rule in post-apartheid South Africa, where a sunset clause meant there would not be an immediate wholesale purge of the former administration and those who served it.</p> <p>That may be all the more important in Zimbabwe, where the deep loathing and suspicion between the two sides is personal, and Zanu-PF chiefs regard Tsvangirai with contempt for his lack of liberation struggle credentials.</p> <p>Yet there are many in Zanu-PF who realise that if their party is to have a future it is without Mugabe as leader, and that crippling the coalition administration will do nothing to rebuild the party's fortunes. Throughout all of this, Tsvangirai will have to stay focused on getting to another election swiftly and with his credibility intact.</p> <p>The agreement plans a new constitution within 18 months. The MDC wants to see an election within two years or so. Unless Tsvangirai messes it up completely - and it's hard to imagine that life will not improve if the foreign money comes in - then the voters will bury Mugabe. </p> <p>Zimbabwe's president will probably never be tried for his many crimes. But tomorrow he may well be signing the death warrant for his political career.</p> <h2>From Rhodesia to the Mugabe years</h2> <p><strong>1922</strong> The British South Africa Company ends rule of Southern Rhodesia and white minority rule begins.</p> <p><strong>1963</strong> Central African Federation - S Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), N Rhodesia (Zambia) and Nyasaland (Malawi) - breaks up. </p> <p><strong>1965</strong> Rhodesia's Prime Minister Ian Smith declares independence.

  "<p>I don't know about you, but NO WAY am I going to vote for that fascist John McCain in the Presidential election. Because Madonna told me not to. Oh, and because I'm not American. But, say I was a US citizen, then Madonna's live show cleverly slotting McCain's snowy head among images of equally un-hip oldsters such as Adolf Hitler and Robert Mugabe, well, you know, it might make me think. It might sway my vote. If I was American. And a lock-down gibbering idiot.</p> <p>Ah, pop and protest. Like Angelina and Brad, so attractive when apart, and so irritating when together. Pop, with its outsider history and its bloody-minded anti-authoritarianism, has always been gagging to change the world. It's a shame that when it tries to do so via a political cause, or worse, a political party, it becomes as radical as flicking a V-sign at the telly when David Cameron is on. The political machine might be grown-up and boring, but since the Sixties, it has always tamed pop. It has always won. </p> <p>The first Live Aid had an impact because it was explicitly apolitical. Bob Geldof and Midge Ure didn't wheel Maggie Thatcher on to the Wembley stage to punch the air between Bono and Freddie Mercury, to warble 'It's Christmas-time ... ' and then point her mic at the audience. They body-swerved government to deliver their message and their aid. Two years later, Red Wedge showed how it shouldn't be done when Billy Bragg, Jimmy Somerville and a very uncomfortable Paul Weller put their arms around Neil Kinnock to get us to vote Labour. That worked well for all concerned, didn't it? Only slightly better was the Cool Britannia party at Number 10 with Noel Gallagher grinning at Tony Blair ...</p> <p>The problem with politics is that it involves politicians, and politicians are freaks. Far, far weirder than pop stars. Pop stars are arrogant, unsure, live in a fairytale; but they are human. Every politician I've met is as warm as Barbie. Politicians are a combination of precocious schoolkid and condescending teacher. You wouldn't want them in your house. Apart from Tony Benn, a National Treasure\u2122 and good at making tea.</p> <p>Protest music has a distinguished history, but, 'Shipbuilding' aside, it's never worked for me, It's all just too direct, too hectoring. It's not what pop is for. Pop seems far more politically radical when it's true to itself. The blandest exhortation to hold each other's hand can be outrageous when trilling from the radio in Iraq or China. Even in lucky, liberal Britain, seeing Neneh Cherry on Top of the Pops while she was heavily pregnant, or watching an entire Glastonbury sing along to 'Common People', or witnessing Estelle's bright star soar across the summer can change your perspective. Far more so than Rage Against the Machine, who had a moment at the Reading Festival the other week when they stormed on stage in their orange boiler suits, but then spoilt it all by trying to bludgeon home the 'message'. </p> <p>Anyway, the song that accompanied Madonna's bad-guys-good-guys video (Obama was slotted in alongside Lennon and Gandhi, just in case you didn't get her drift) was the 'Get Stupid Remix'. The 'Get Stupid' bit comes from the hit track 'Give It 2 Me', which exhorts the listener to ignore the nay-sayers and get on with what we really want to achieve. Like Norman Tebbit in fishnets, her thighs rigid with capitalism, Madonna is impatient for us to get off our butts and kick ass for Obama. When, really, the fact that she is still performing at the forefront of pop music as a 50-year-old woman is a political message that's far, far more radical.</p>",
  "<p>Inside Denver's sold-out, packed-to-the-girders, cacophonously loud Invesco stadium, it's a few minutes to showtime. The crowd are shouting and singing and chanting and doing the Mexican wave. 'YES WE CAN!' they roar, unprompted, repeatedly. You can't buy beer today (although bags of Original Presidential Roast coffee are available from the merchandise stalls, $10 a pop) but everyone's drunk on excitement. Or wired on the nachos' neon-orange cheese sauce. </p> <p>The support acts have done their turns: the soul icon (Stevie Wonder), the Starbucks folkie (Sheryl Crow), the conscious R&amp;B brainbox (John Legend), the celebrity hip hopper (Black Eyed Peas' will.i.am), the baby-boomer comfort-crooner (Michael McDonald).</p> <p>Up on the roofs, the Swat spotters scan the vast arena with binoculars. Down on the floor, there's a minor kerfuffle as the Rev Al Sharpton arrives. Agents in suits and sunglasses touch their earpieces. There's George Lucas. Spike Lee's in the house, declaring the night is 'bigger than the Super Bowl!' There's Jin from Lost, Jessica Alba from Hollywood, Shawn Johnson from the Olympics (the gold medal-winning gymnast recites the Pledge of Allegiance). Al Gore, a bunch of generals, President Eisenhower's granddaughter and various Washington big-hitters file on and off stage. </p> <p>But it's the musicians who have kept the six hour show on the road until the headline act arrives. There has been no sign of Joss Stone, who will be singing on an election song, but Fergie has been spotted, so it's not all good news. American Idol runner-up turned Oscar-winner Jennifer Hudson sang'The Star-Spangled Banner'. It was the second Denver gig for five-time-Grammy-winner Legend, who earlier in the week had unveiled a new song, 'If You're Out There', which had been billed as 'an anthemic call to action and evocation of human potential'. It went: 'We're the generation/ We can't afford to wait/ The future started yesterday/ And we're already late.'<br> Me and California indie-blues band Cold War Kids, we're already late too. Mainly because we've spent the afternoon standing in the longest queue I've ever experienced. In 89C heat we shuffled round parking lots, along back alleys, down grassy knolls, into narrowed pens. We were harangued en route by all manner of pedlars (everything from souvenir water to souvenir hand-towels) and protesters waving banners: Bring The Troops Home; Don't Invade Iran; Impeach Bush; Forget John McCain, Love Hillary Clinton; Forget Hillary Clinton, Love Jesus; No, Love Communism. And we were shepherded all the way by an army of cops.</p> <p>We did this, the shuffle-queuing, for three hours. That's what happens when 84,000 people turn up to hear a senator speak, and when the Secret Service are checking everyone's bags. That's what happens when Barack Obama comes to town, to the home of the Denver Broncos American football team, to deliver the most important speech of his career. Welcome to stadium politics. It's like stadium rock, only the sound is better.</p> <p>This is, as one of the most popular T-shirts has it, Barack And Roll. And this is Denver, Colorado during the Democratic National Convention 2008, the four-day razzmatazz event at which the party officially selects Obama as its candidate to fight November's presidential election against the Republicans' Vietnam war hero John McCain. The legacy of two epochal events hangs in the ether: Obama is speaking on the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's 'I Have a Dream' speech, and it's 40 years since Chicago '68, the infamous Democratic Convention that followed the assassination of another People's Politician, Robert F Kennedy , and which descended into brutally suppressed riots.</p> <p>All over town there are rallies, meetings, parties, protests, law enforcement of every stripe and gun calibre, and 15,000 representatives of the global media. The celebrity contingent ranges from Ben Affleck and Charlize Theron to Muhammad Alivia the hot-ticket Vanity Fair bash. The accredited bloggers, all 500 of them, have their own tent. That's a lot of hot air and electromagnetic radiation zooming up into the Rocky Mountains. No wonder everyone in the Mile High City this week is a little, well, crazed. And there are bands. Rage Against the Machine do a free gig then lead 5,000 anti-war protesters on a demo. NERD play a Rock the Vote show. Kanye West performs a keynote concert, as is increasingly usual for him, way past everyone's bedtime. And it's not just the hip hop community who are turning out for the politico with Jay-Z on his iPod and on speed dial. The indie kids are here in force, too, with Cold War Kids joining Jenny Lewis, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah! and Death Cab For Cutie at a hipster art event called Manifest Hope. Beat that, Cool Britannia.</p> <p>Manifest Hope encompasses an exhibition and two gigs: an open-air early evening freebie and a late night 'VIP invite-only' show with Zooey Deschanel, the Hollywood actress who, as She &amp; Him, made the recent (and very good) album Volume One with singer-songwriter M Ward. Support comes from super-hot comedian Sarah Silverman, and from the mayor of Seattle (who mentions his city's proud grunge heritage).</p> <p>The DNC '08 is a rock'n'roll event for a rock'n'roll candidate, who has been feted on the cover of Rolling Stone and Spin. The singalong slogans are all over the place, on T-shirts, posters and banners. Barack The Vote. The New American Dream. A Legacy Of Hope. Change We Can Believe In. It's Time! The Real Deal. Obama In The House. Rock'n'roll candidate: that sounds fatuous, but it's still true. Obama \u2013 young, gifted and black \u2013 is treated like a rock star by the cool kids. Boy, do they think he's a rock star.</p> <p>'Portraiture is something I've always done of my music heroes \u2013 Joe Strummer, Bob Marley, Joey Ramone, Henry Rollins,' says Shepard Fairey, 38. He's the Los Angeles-based graphic artist whose stature in the US is akin to Banksy's here. Inspired by the presidential hopeful's message, Fairey designed two posters, titled Hope and Change. He's wearing a badge that says 'Obama' in the font used by AC/DC. 'My Obama poster is in the tradition of my work, to put people I think are trailblazers on a pedestal.'</p> <p>The posters were an instant pop-culture and blogosphere sensation in the US, and Fairey received a personally signed thank you note from Obama. They catalysed this week's Manifest Hope exhibition: a collection of Obama art submitted by creative figures from the graffiti, hip hop and urban scenes. It fills 10,000sq ft of gallery space in a grungily cool Denver neighbourhood. 'Just look around the exhibition at all these images of him,' says David Choe, 32, from New York, who contributed a spraycan work titled Hussein (Obama's middle name). 'He's not even human any more, he's like Jesus. He's become a symbol.'</p> <p>Why are Cold War Kids \u2013 whose Robbers &amp; Cowards debut was one of the critical hits of 2006 , and who share management with the White Stripes and Vampire Weekend \u2013 here? </p> <p>'We have always thought that the size of your band is directly in proportion to the size of your influence,' says singer Nathan Willett . It's an obvious point but stick with him; Cold War Kids are viscerally exciting on record (imagine Tom Waits fronting a de-techno'd Radiohead) but they're sober and methodical in speech. 'To be a political band without having any influence is really kinda silly and dogmatic,' he continues. 'But if you have influence and you can use it productively, that's great.' With their imminent second album, Loyalty to Loyalty, attracting advance raves, the savvy band are aware of their burgeoning heft \u2013 and of the promotional/fun possibilities. 'We're newly in a place where we have a little spotlight. And,' Willett adds, 'it's nice to play a little party.' Especially a party taking place during an event at which history is being made.</p> <p>The day before Barack Obama's Invesco Field speech, the Manifest Hope street bash is teeming. Will.i.am tours the exhibition; earlier this year he created the Obama mash-up 'Yes We Can ' featuring extracts from the senator's speeches and vocals from, among others, Scarlett Johansson. Spike Lee has already swung by, reportedly buying myriad prints of the exhibited art.</p> <p>At the entrance to the gallery is a poster declaring Obama a 'champion of the arts', and setting out his platform in this area. This includes: creating an arts corps that will work in low-income schools and communities; supporting increased funding for the National Endowment For the Arts (whose budget has been cut from $175m per annum in 1992 to $125m pa today); and providing healthcare and ensuring tax fairness for artists. No wonder the arts community are firmly onside. </p> <p>'Before Obama kids were not rocking politicians on their T-shirts and buying posters,' says artist Sam Flores, 32, from San Francisco, who has contributed New America, an acrylic and aerosol artwork to the show. 'But art and music and urban culture is helping bring them in \u2013 now everyone is making an effort to be part of politics. It's not just because he's the first black candidate \u2013 he represents ideas and openness.'</p> <p>The political thinking behind the exhibition, says excited gallery co-owner Tom Horne, is to say to young people: 'If these awesome, world famous, rad artists are getting together for this cause, YOU CAN TOO!'</p> <p>New York artist Ron English's Abraham Obama is one of the most striking pieces (his point, he says, is that the allegedly 'inexperienced' senator of four years standing has just as much experience of office as did America's favourite President). At 49, English is less prone to being swept up in the giddy Obamania. 'Most smart politicians in history, even the most evil ones like Hitler, used music and art,' he says. ''Cause art and music is how you get to people's hearts and souls.'</p> <p>Cold War Kids are also wary of being reduced to Obama cheerleaders. Formerly students at a Christian college, they're more about ideas than political partisanship \u2013 they wouldn't necessarily be turning up for congratulatory drinkies at the White House. Their second album's title, Loyalty to Loyalty, was inspired by the writings of Josiah Royce , a late 19th-century philosopher and proto-socialist from California. They're big fans of author David Foster Wallace , quoting on their website his thoughts on how the most effective new rebels might be the ones with old fashioned values.<br> 'The biggest objective Wallace wants to get across is to turn away from a style of writing that is ironical and sarcastic,' says Willett, 'and point towards a much more genuine and sincere style of communication. A lot of people have talked about that with Obama \u2013 from his mannerisms to his speech, he's a very sincere guy, a genuine character.</p> <p>Like U2 in a suit, Obama's sincerity and abstract but powerful quasi-spiritual messages \u2013 Change We Can Believe In; Yes We Can \u2013 are certainly inspiring near-fanatical enthusiasm among youth voters previously untouched, in every sense, by politics.</p> <p>Annie, 20, and Sam Woods, 24, have put their hearts, souls and lives into Obama. Sam spent two days covering her 1990 Volvo 240 DL in 520 Obama stickers. The sisters then drove the 1,200 miles to Denver from their home in Santa Cruz, California, blogging and selling stencilled Obama T-shirts along the way. Out in the street, as the bands soundcheck in the late afternoon heat, there is a huge buzz of interest in the sisters' car. They hand out cards for their Drive the Movement website (<a href=\"http://www.obamamobileusa.com\">obamamobileusa.com</a>). Why have they done all this? </p> <p>'Because change happens from the bottom up,' says Annie, 'and we want to be part of that. Obama is historic. What's happening now is monumental.'<br> 'Before Obama politics was this exclusive, I-have-money-and-we're-gonna-rule type government,' says Sam. 'Whereas now it's flipped \u2013 young people are involved, and all these artists and musicians are coming from the ground up and being inspired.' </p> <p>I hear similar zeal from the eager fans watching Cold War Kids that evening. Their short outdoor set \u2013 introduced by the mayor of Long Beach (like a proper politico, he's riding the slipstream of his up'n'coming hometown boys) and watched by the mayor of San Francisco (who looks like a catalogue model, or Eighties TV character Max Headroom) \u2013 is brilliant. Willett, bass player Matt Maust , guitarist Jonnie Russell and drummer Matt Aveiro throw themselves into the turbulent likes of the last album's 'Hang Me Up to Dry ' and the new one's 'Welcome to the Occupation '. </p> <p>'It's really important to see bands like Cold War Kids playing \u2013 we respect them and so we respect the things they stand up for,' says Sam Britten, 23, from Denver as they troop off stage. She's wearing a T-shirt made by a local artist. 'It's Time For A Democratic Party', it says, over a picture of Obama. While in college she helped register voters, focusing on 18- to 24-year-olds. 'And we could do nothing to get them to the polls or care about the issues. But here there are entire galleries in Denver filled with art devoted to Obama.' White-haired, 72-year-old millionaire John McCain, 'he can't do that!'</p> <p>'I'm here 'cause I love music, and I love Obama,' says Nasir Malik, a 20-year-old local with an Obama badge pinned to his baseball cap. 'He incites change. I've never felt that before, not in the right way. Good change, not a negative change.' </p> <p>Julia Rosen, 27, from Sacramento, is wearing a T-shirt that says 'I Blogged Your Girlfriend'. She's covering the convention for political website Calitics. 'As bloggers, the Obama campaign have empowered us to be their spokespeople. And they've very much decentralised the campaign. Young people are not watching the nightly news or reading newspapers much, so they get their news from alternative sources, whether that's The Daily Show or musicians or other trusted sources. They'll be like, \"Oh yeah, Cold War Kids were talking up Obama last night and the concert was awesome.\" Them telling five friends that, who then tell five other friends, that's what's going to get the youth out to vote and win him the election.' </p> <p>But what if all this is just ammo for the Republican charge that Barack Obama is just a celebrity? A smiley fella who likes the limelight and the famous supporters more than he likes the nitty-gritty of reforming tax policy, weaning America off its oil addiction and sorting out the mess in Iraq and Afghanistan?</p> <p>Ron English, artist: 'The only reason he's a \"celebrity\" is because people love him.'</p> <p>Jonnie Russell, Cold War Kid: 'It's definitely a danger, a slippery slope. But it happens on both sides \u2013 you've got Ted Nugent supporting the Republicans.'</p> <p>Shepard Fairey, artist: 'The concept of \"celebrity\" is that they're elite and untouchable. That's not Obama.'</p> <p>Sam Wood, activist: 'Is Obama a celebrity or a rock star? Hey, aren't we all rock stars? I don't think it should hurt him. It should empower people, the fact that he has that image. For years our presidents have been old white guys. He's in touch with our generation.'</p> <p>The following night's event at Invesco Stadium is a thrilling thing to behold. It is more rock'n'roll than any actual stadium concert I've ever been to. Once the deafening cheers greeting his arrival on stage have eventually subsided, Barack Obama rises to the occasion, showing his teeth at last and laying into McCain with a series of trenchant critiques and funny one-liners. No more Mr Nice Guy. And he off ers up impressive detail on a range of policy changes. No more Mr Celebrity. Well, as non-celebrity as the star of one of the biggest speeches by a politician in recent American history can be. At home, 38.4 million Americans are watching on TV. </p> <p>Inside this huge arena, the 84,000 excited fans lap up Obama's 45-minute set. If he could have done an encore (one short, catchy paragraph, say), they'd have gone even crazier. Then, a family hug, fireworks, confetti cannon and a vast, fluttering ocean of American flags. And there's one final musical trick: as Obama leaves the stage, Bruce Springsteen's 'Born in the USA' blares out across the stadium. Finally, a more fitting political context after the Reagan Republicans' mid-Eighties' misappropriation of The Boss's blue collar anthem.</p> <p>As we file out, a teenage girl approaches Cold War Kid Matt Maust and asks for an autograph. Alyson King, 16, is from Long Beach too. She came all this way for the Convention; seeing a show last night by a band from her hometown was an awesome bonus.</p> <p>Does she think an indie band can help the Democrats win the presidency after eight years of Bush?</p> <p>'Cold War Kids playing totally helps the cause. It gets the word out.

  "<p>Nothing ranks higher in the demonology of the Labour movement than 'the Tory press'. It printed the forged Zinoviev Letter, which won the 1924 election for the Tories with the false but subtle claim that Labour's softness towards the Soviet Union was encouraging communists to plot a revolution in Britain. It so smeared Neil Kinnock, the hopeless John Major won the 1992 election. For almost a century, the Labour tradition held that if its leaders did not win or if left-wing arguments did not convince, it was not because the leaders were fallible or arguments weak but because the Tory press had convinced voters to ignore them.</p> <p>Although Labour people believed the Tory press capable of anything, they would never have believed that the agents of a Labour Prime Minister would use it to destroy the reputation of a Labour minister. Last week, far too many MPs for Gordon Brown's comfort thought that was exactly what his supporters had done to Ivan Lewis.</p> <p>The junior minister is a political ally of Alan Johnson, the affable health secretary, who as one of the few politicians in Westminster who can speak to the English working class is also a potential candidate for Brown's job. In March Lewis wrote that Labour needed 'national renewal and a new generation of political leadership'. You did not need to be a code-breaker to know he meant that Brown was yesterday's man. In August, he argued that the government should tax the rich not the middle class, hardly a radical argument for a Labour politician, but one Brown did not want to hear.</p> <p>Lewis ought to have known that Whitehall had a secret which could hurt him. In 2006, he had a mid-life crisis. He left his wife of 16 years and mother of his two children and fixed his attention on Susie Mason, a young civil servant in his office. As far as we know the dozens of text messages he sent her were not nasty, but Lewis certainly pestered her. She protested, and Whitehall moved her to another job. Her complaint lay in the cabinet office files.</p> <p>Last Sunday the News of the World and Mail on Sunday had it all over their front pages. A Mafia hit, muttered Labour MPs. The Brownites have taken out Lewis and warned others about the consequences of speaking freely. I was as interested in the minority who protested that the case against Brown had not been proven, and wondered if a gossipy civil servant had sold the story instead. Although they defended him, not one said: 'Come off it, Nick, Brown may be rough but he'd never allow his aides to stitch-up a colleague in the Tory tabloids.'</p> <p>They knew Brown's form too well. On the same day the Lewis story appeared, The Observer carried a fierce attack on David Miliband, the equally affable Foreign Secretary. It came from Derek Simpson, joint leader of the Unite union. As everyone at the TUC conference was pointing out, Charlie Whelan is Brown's man in the union movement, and runs Unite's political department.</p> <p>First Johnson and then Miliband. As the Don went for all his enemies at once, the Sunday papers looked like the closing scenes of The Godfather</p> <p>A few days earlier, I had listened open-mouthed as a Brownite delivered a jeering, contemptuous assault on Alistair Darling for the mistake of speaking incautiously to the Guardian. It wasn't only the tone that riled me, but the knowledge that Darling was not Brown's enemy but a friend who was uncomplainingly cleaning up the mess his master had left at the Treasury. 'Loyalty is what the bosses screw you with,' trade unionists used to say, and Darling's trusting nature made him a soft target for the Brownites.</p> <p>Last month, an article in the Telegraph (another Tory paper) claimed Miliband would appoint Alan Milburn as his Chancellor if he replaced Brown. The story wasn't true, Miliband categorically denied it, but it was subtle. Milburn's name is poison, in part because of the battering Brown's aides gave him. No challenger would win the votes of the unions and constituency parties if they thought he wanted to bring the 'uber-Blairite' back to power.</p> <p>I don't want to be too prissy. All Prime Ministers need their thugs, and there is much that is noble in Brown's efforts since 1997 to reduce poverty and rebuild the schools and hospitals of Britain. The trouble with the Brown administration is that increasingly its thuggish face is the only face on show. When he became Prime Minister, he promised to reach across the political spectrum. Like Sarkozy, Obama and McCain, he said he would build a government of all the talents. As the economic crisis has deepened, he has returned to his old sectarianism. Downing Street is now a bunker filled with his gang of trusties: men with few discernible qualities beyond a cultish devotion to their leader.</p> <p>They think they can carry on as they did in the days when they went for Alan Milburn, and do not understand how the world has changed. One of the ugliest aspects of politics is the sycophancy which surrounds successful leaders. When his colleagues thought Brown had a strong grip on the economy, many admired his strong-arm tactics. The one complemented the other and showed that Brown was a leader in control. His failure has shifted the ground rules. Now the economy is falling apart his colleagues are likely to be far less indulgent.</p> <p>'A bully is less frightening when he's weak,' as one senior figure explained to me. Many are now grasping that no law says Gordon Brown is the only Labour politician allowed to use the sneak attack; that nothing in the Labour party's constitution prevents his targets responding in kind.</p> <p>As rebels challenge his leadership this weekend, Brown should make his case for continuing in power honourably and fight his critics in the open. If he does not, he will find that the tactics of his made men will destroy his premiership.</p>",
  "<p>Firing a fresh salvo in a presidential election battle that has turned into a war of the sexes, Sarah Palin has taunted Barack Obama for not picking Hillary Clinton as his running mate.</p> <p>As John McCain's surprise vice-presidential candidate, Palin has been giving her first major media interview. In the latest instalment released by TV network ABC on Friday, Palin took aim at Obama's decision to pass Clinton over. 'I think he's regretting not picking her now. I do,' the Alaska governor told ABC anchor Charlie Gibson. She went on to praise Clinton's performance in her epic but doomed nomination battle with Obama. 'What determination and grit and even grace, through some tough shots that were fired her way. She handled those well,' Palin said.</p> <p>Since being launched on the national scene, Palin has rejuvenated McCain's fortunes, spearheaded by a flow of women voters. Palin has publicly praised Clinton as a means of wooing that key female demographic. However, she has also brought a notably more negative tone to the election, marked by a series of ugly rows between the two camps.</p> <p>Her latest comments about Clinton proved no exception. In a sharp-edged response, Obama-supporting Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said: 'Sarah Palin should spare us the phoney sentiment and respect.' That sort of prompt push back is likely to define the Obama camp as it copes with the way Palin has shaken up the race. </p> <p>Painfully aware of the floundering John Kerry campaign of 2004, Obama has in effect relaunched for the final seven weeks of the battle. 'Today is the first day of the rest of the campaign,' said Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, in an email on Friday. 'We will respond with speed and ferocity to John McCain's attacks, and we will take the fight to him.'</p> <p>'Democrats have to be more aggressive. They have to be proactive,' said Professor Joanne Green, a political scientist at Texas Christian University. Obama now seems to have taken such advice to heart, using hard-hitting new adverts that are trying to put the focus back on McCain and on the bread-and-butter issues facing America. A new ad unveiled at the end of last week was about the economy but did not hesitate to attack McCain personally, pointing to remarks he once made about not knowing how to use a computer or send an email. </p> <p>Yet it will be difficult to get the spotlight off Palin. Huge speculation surrounded her first TV interview and she appears to have mostly cleared the hurdle of her first bout of media exposure. Palin spent long hours holed up in Alaska with senior Republican aides, going over talking points, briefing her with policy memos and firing mock questions. In the end, she did hesitate and stumble over some key questions, especially foreign policy and the intricacies of welfare policy. </p> <p>However, she also came off as confident and able to handle herself in the face of determined questioning. 'She's a former beauty queen and an ex-sports anchor. She's a communicator. Many Americans think, \"I would be comfortable having her sitting in my kitchen\",' said Steve Mitchell, a pollster and chairman of Mitchell Research. 'Democrats ought to be concerned.'</p> <p>They are. Palin has had a huge impact. After months of Obama sitting ahead of McCain, suddenly the positions are reversed. The latest average of polls has McCain ahead of Obama by 2.3 points. He also improved his performance in key battleground states, such as Ohio and Florida, that will decide the election. </p> <p>Palin seems to have tapped into a large section of women voters the Obama camp overlooked or assumed would flock to its candidate. But there is also some truth in Palin's claims that Obama might regret not picking Clinton or another woman. His choice of Senator Joe Biden created the chance for McCain to pick Palin. Choosing Clinton would have dulled, or even prevented, the 'Palin effect' now defining the race. 'In a way Obama's decisions created Palin,' said Mitchell. 'He only has himself to blame.'</p>",
  "<p>For Barry McKernan and Saavik Ford, academics who live with their baby son in New York, sitting down to the television news is a nightly ritual, as it has been for generations of families. But there the tradition ends. Instead of watching heavyweight presenters dispense news from on high, the couple switch to The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, known for delivering stories with lacerating humour and an inbuilt bullshit detector. They know Stewart will part politicians from their reputations with laser-like precision, while simultaneously rubbing the media's nose in its own deference. And, more importantly, they trust him.</p> <p>'The Daily Show is probably more reliable for news than anything on TV except PBS [Public Broadcasting Service],' said McKernan, 36, who teaches astronomy at the Borough of Manhattan Community College. 'It stands apart from everything else because it unspins the news. It frankly points out how ridiculous the 24-hour news networks are - mostly gassing away by unqualified 'experts' filling the hours.'</p> <p>McKernan and Ford - young, liberal, politically engaged - are typical of a section of America that has grown sceptical of what they see as mainstream television's bland, knee-jerk journalism. For them only one man is asking the right questions, and that is a 45-year-old comedian called Jon Stewart. Like a court jester, he segues into truths that solemn courtiers cannot or dare not, announcing to the startled throng that the emperor has no clothes. Ford, 30, reflected: 'The mainstream news media appear to me to be too lazy to do their jobs as well as a comedian.'</p> <p>The Daily Show is satire with substance, a spoof news programme in which Stewart mercilessly punctures the headlines and skewers the powerful with cleverly edited film clips, sharp one-liners and bemused expressions. It features interviews - guests have included Victoria Beckham, Bill Clinton, Tom Cruise and Pervez Musharraf - and parodic news items from a team of roving reporters. Ridiculous stories delivered with a straight face, in the style of the fake newspaper The Onion, are combined with the bracing iconoclasticism of Michael Moore minus earnestness or ego. British viewers - who can catch it on the More4 channel four times a week or via the Comedy Central website - might be reminded of the Nineties news spoof The Day Today with Chris Morris and Steve Coogan, Angus Deayton's irreverent hosting of Have I Got News for You and Armando Iannucci's taste for the politically preposterous. Add the rottweiler instincts of John Humphrys or Jeremy Paxman, and throw in some downright silliness, and you have something approaching The Daily Show.</p> <p>Broadcast on cable channel Comedy Central, it has prospered in the Bush years with steadily growing viewing figures - still below 2 million but, like the New York Times (circulation 1.1 million), punching above its weight with opinion formers. Its bite-sized chunks of laugh-out-loud smartness are also perfectly geared for internet virals and the so-called 'YouTube generation'. A blogger called Matt Tobey may have only got slightly carried away last week when he wrote: 'I wasn't alive to see Michelangelo paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. I wasn't born yet when the Beatles toured. And I probably won't ever get out to see that Japanese dude eat all them hotdogs. But goddamn, seeing Jon Stewart at his absolute best running circles around cable news douchebags is almost as good.'</p> <p>This year's presidential election has marked Stewart's coming of age as a cultural and political force in America. Whereas his debut as Oscars host in 2006 saw some jokes fall flat, he returned this year in triumph with timely political gags. Appearing on The Daily Show - described by Newsweek magazine as 'the coolest pit stop on television' - is now a gamble that no would-be president can afford to duck if they want to parade their 'human side' and ability to laugh at themselves. John McCain, the Republican candidate, has been on more than a dozen times over the years. Barack Obama, his Democratic rival, used The Daily Show for his last TV appearance before the primary election in Pennsylvania. Hillary Clinton - 'the first viable presidential candidate with a working uterus' - appeared on the eve of the crucial primaries in Texas and Ohio. At the Democratic national convention, Daily Show reporters found it hard to work as they were mobbed by so many fans.</p> <p>It is a delicious paradox that people's search for truth has led them to fake news. Under the headline 'Is Jon Stewart the Most Trusted Man in America?', the New York Times opined recently: 'The Daily Show resonates not only because it is wickedly funny but also because its keen sense of the absurd is perfectly attuned to an era in which cognitive dissonance has become a national epidemic. Indeed, Stewart's frequent exclamation \"Are you insane?!\" seems a fitting refrain for a post-M*A*S*H, post-Catch-22 reality, where the surreal and outrageous have become commonplace - an era kicked off by the 2000 election standoff in Florida, rocked by 9/11 and haunted by the fallout of a costly war waged on the premise of weapons of mass destruction that did not exist.'</p> <p>Showing politicians condemn themselves out of their own mouths is a classic Stewart manoeuvre. In one sequence, The Daily Show spliced excerpts from McCain's acceptance speech at the Republican convention with one by Bush before he became president. The word-for-word similarities were uncanny, promising change in Washington, a pro-life culture and the rest. It was a masterpiece of editing that required no narrative to tear down false idols, arguably more effective than anything the Democrats have thrown at McCain in recent weeks. It makes Obama's argument that McCain represents a third term of Bush more eloquently than the candidate himself has so far managed.</p> <p>Stewart's admirers in the political and media classes are legion. David Remnick, editor of the New Yorker magazine, told The Observer: 'He is our most astute - and, obviously, most hilarious - press watchdog and overall political bullshit monitor. His most effective move is to cull through the tapes of all the countless banalities, hypocritical contradictions and attempted snow-jobs executed in boundless profusion on our airwaves and on political podiums. He just puts them on the air and you watch with slack-jawed amazement.'</p> <p>Remnick added: 'Stewart is all the things the best stand-up comics are - quick, verbally deft - but he is also possessed of a political and moral sense. There are days when I think he is the only one keeping a sane head.'</p> <p>The Daily Show also satirises American media with its cliches, hang-ups and petty obsessions. For those who accuse Rupert Murdoch's Fox News of being a partisan Republican mouthpiece, there seemed to be no antidote until The Daily Show came along. It also strikes a chord with those who feel the 24-hour news channels hype every gaffe into a hurricane and despair of US newspapers as their circulations fall and they lay off staff. </p> <p>The lack of aggression in challenging the official intelligence used to justify the Iraq war, and the timidity around revelations of John Edwards's extramarital affair are just two examples of a perceived cancer eating into American journalism.</p> <p>Step forward Stewart, filling the void not with new facts - he does not claim to be an investigative reporter - but forensic editing and satirical snap. Iraq was quickly branded 'Mess O'Potamia'. While mainstream TV news endlessly repeated the Pentagon's description of 'the coalition of the willing' backing US forces, Stewart was quick to dub them the 'coalition of the piddling' and point out that allies such as Morocco were sending not troops but 2,000 monkeys to set off landmines. Other media were forced to play catch-up when the show highlighted the links between Halliburton, of which Vice-President Dick Cheney was chief executive, and government wartime contracts worth millions.</p> <p>Gavin Esler, the BBC's Newsnight presenter and former chief North America correspondent, describes Stewart as 'hugely influential' in the US. 'I think his success tells you a great deal about the dire state of some American network television journalism. It is often parochial, sentimental and focused on a diet of crime stories, supposedly \"human interest\" stories and medical \"breakthroughs\". It is no coincidence that the biggest cheer Sarah Palin received in her Republican convention speech was when she attacked the mainstream media.</p> <p>'Stewart is highly intelligent, perceptive and persistent as an interviewer but also funny. He allows his guests to be human and is not sycophantic. The best interviews I have seen this year with Obama, Hillary Clinton and McCain have all been by Stewart. It's hardly surprising they appear on his shows - they get to demonstrate their own sense of humour, which is very appealing to voters.'</p> <p>Many on the right believe the show is too liberal, in a country where that can be something of a dirty word. Stewart has admitted he is looking forward to the end of the Bush administration 'as a comedian, as a person, as a citizen, as a mammal'. But The Daily Show goes beyond party politics. When political debate in the most powerful country on Earth boils down to the semantics of 'putting lipstick on a pig', its stiffest challenge is to keep fake news more absurd than the real thing. Keep succeeding, and Jon Stewart might even swing the election.</p>",
  "<p>Consider what ordinary, hard-working people do in recession - or, at least, what the media tell us they do. They cut back on waste. They eat all the food they buy (and get it from Lidl rather than Marks). They save heat by the pennyworth, turn out the lights, say farewell to fripperies. Pain, pain, pain. But look now and see what those same media prophets of doom are doing.</p> <p>Up in a rush goes the price of newspapers: the Times to 80p, the Telegraph to 90p - and, from tomorrow, the Independent to \u00a31. You may remember, from a couple of years ago, how Simon Kelner, then editor but now chief executive at the Independent, said that he thought daily papers ought to cost a pound - and Sundays \u00a32. Well, the Sunday Times took his advice, and famously came a cropper; but now his own baby is taking the Kelner test.</p> <p>Inside mediaworld, of course, such decisions run on familiar grooves. If advertising is falling off a cliff, then the only other source of revenue - cover price - has to be tapped. And if there is no cover price - because you're a free newspaper - then that may be very hard cheese. Trinity Mirror closed seven frees last week. But, at least, where there's a price, there's a way out.</p> <p>Except that it's not a particularly appetising way. Much of the gloom this autumn has wafted over from America like some remnant of Hurricane Hanna. The New York Times has put up its price twice in a year and sampled the bitter consequences. This week it's cutting out some of its sections and producing something thinner and smaller from Monday to Saturday. The size and range of what's offered to the reader is shrinking as well - and crudely geared to staff cuts.</p> <p>Some of those cuts can be very crude indeed. Richard Desmond of the Daily Express, a proprietor who might have played centre-back for Croatia in another life, has begun dumping another 80 journalists, many of them sub-editors. Yet the one thing you might expect from our founts of superior wisdom - a pause for thought, a careful selection of strategic aims - doesn't appear to be happening.</p> <p>It's difficult and confusing, to be sure. The same companies pushing up prices on news shelves or trying to raise more cash from more TV commercials are also deeply involved with providing their basic product without charge: free news on a free internet, or seemingly free news every time you turn on a radio set or 24-hour TV news channel. What's supposedly precious is also ubiquitous - which in turn gives the stock markets the shakes, and saw ITV drop out of the FTSE 100.</p> <p>Take that vital step back for a moment, though. Sir Martin Sorrell, the supreme ad guru, told 100 assembled ITV managers last week that his clients 'are looking for mass audiences, high market shares and interesting content ... You've got to remember that you're not going to cut your way to growth.' Quality counts. But so does producing something that people can and will buy.</p> <p>One problem with newspaper sales was apparent long before anyone mentioned the internet. Because home delivery systems were so frail, circulation depended on news stands, which didn't suit regular buying habits in a hard-working, constantly rushing life. So, day by day, customers switched between titles - or simply gave the lot of them a miss. Where once a family might have bought five papers a week, now they bought four, three, two, one ... Price mattered - and so did sheer size. </p> <p>Editors piled in extra coverage and extra sections. Marketing teams piled in more free gifts, wall charts, DVDs. Publishers piled on bulk giveaway copies and foreign 'sales' to keep their figures looking respectable (witness the Telegraph giving away 99,000 copies a day or the Indie sending 55,000 abroad). But now the music has stopped.</p> <p>Perhaps the New York Times might find that a terser, but cheaper, paper will sell better through the week. Perhaps bulk in whatever form doesn't hit the spot any longer. Perhaps real sales figures without giveaway illusions would release money to invest in quality. Perhaps ploughing investment into internet sites to persuade readers to shift, then giving them free Hitchcock movies to tempt them to stay, is confusion compounded. Perhaps the moment for a decisive shift in expectations - defining anew what media analysts expect from company earnings - has finally arrived. </p> <p> The aim in recession, we were told 16 years ago when the last one happened, was to come out stronger as it ended. And many newspapers and broadcasters did. That's where profit expectations were set. The aim this time ought to be just the same in a new, tough landscape where Lidl things mean a lot.</p> <h2>Now you can read about it on screen</h2> <p>Here's a personal question. How do you read your newspaper; and how do you read your news on the net?</p> <p>Probable answer: you flip through the paper, turning the pages, absorbing pictures and headlines, stopping when something catches your interest - but you go to the net with specific intent, Googling, digging deeper.</p> <p>In sum, a newspaper tells you many unexpected things which you didn't know in the process of telling you what you wanted to know, while a website deals in expected things that you already know you need to know. So format matters.</p> <p>The current chorus of industry pundits prophesying newspaper doom thinks it knows that the net will one day be king. Look at sales and hope sliding away! But it never pauses, amid such gloom, to inquire what the conventional desk-bound net itself will amount to at that future point.</p> <p>Not as rich as it might be, perhaps. The monarch of Google himself was recently caught saying that ads on mobile phones would rule the global revenue roost one day, a triumph of individual targeting.</p> <p>Plastic Logic (from Cambridge University via San Diego) launched its new electronic reader last week: thinner than a pad of notepaper, lighter than a magazine, with a big, big screen (8.5in by 11) and the look, if not feel, of reading paper. Just right for a briefcase - and just right, too, for reading digitalised newspapers via broadband on the morning train to Euston.</p> <p>You can turn from page to page, as though you were holding a newsprint bundle. You can pause, perfectly normally, over tales that surprise you, news that you didn't know.</p> <p>This new net tool, in sum, seems on the cusp of fulfilling a newspaper's basic function. But when that comes to pass, it isn't life or death: just doing the basics without the need for presses, lorries, defunct forests and 60 per cent of your existing costs.</p> <p>Don't sign up for the temple of doom too soon, then. All of its pillars are moving parts.</p> <h2>James and the giant speech</h2> <p>Hear him in front of an audience, and James Murdoch, pictured, the rising son, is both technocratic and charismatic: he can talk the talk. Watch him in managerial action, too, at News International or BSkyB, and you know he can walk the walk.</p> <p>But somehow, corporate pen in hand, the impact isn't quite the same: somewhere between sub-Shakespearean and oleaginous.</p> <p>A few days ago, for instance, he bade farewell to Camilla Rhodes, formerly MD of the Times and the Sun. 'She epitomises the can-do spirit of this company,' declared young James. 'Her skill and dedication have been an inspiration and she has made an enormous contribution to our success for almost three decades. She will be sorely missed.' So why is she going, then? Don't ask. </p> <p>And as for the final decision, after many years of looking in estate agents' windows, not to move the whole London caboodle after all: 'Wapping is important not only as a physical site but also as a symbol of how bold individuals, working together, can advance the world of media and thereby contribute to life in Britain.'. Cry God for Harry, England and my dad ...</p> <h2>Would you Adam and Eve it?</h2> <p>Consider proportionality and its responses. Channel Four is screening The Sex Education Show at 8pm on Tuesdays. It necessarily features certain basic genitalia; 2.6 million viewers watch it; 39 of them complain to Ofcom. Is that, as the omniscient regulator trundles into action, a cause for shock and horror? Must television do sex education early, without sex - or after the 9pm watershed when most sensible people have gone to bed anyway?</p> <h2>Dodgy journalism</h2> <p>Leading on a poll is often dodgy journalism. Leading on a US presidential poll is simply flimsy. As this column is written, the nine major American polls are split four to Obama, three to McCain and two all square. Widest variant on one side: Obama with 48 per cent, McCain with 39 per cent; and on the other, McCain 54 per cent, Obama 44 per cent. Big country plus small samples equals prudently small headlines.</p>",
  "<p>A gleaming black-and-white Fender Stratocaster is an unusual item to find in a soldier's kit bag, but for Sergeant John Dobbins it is one of his most treasured possessions. This isn't just any shop-bought axe. Dobbins built his guitar from scratch using parts he bought off eBay and had shipped to his base in Iraq. 'My friends thought I was retarded,' says the 22-year-old who spent 27 months in the war zone. 'I mean, there's no electricity and no amplification there.'</p> <p>Many soldiers take acoustic guitars to Iraq, but in the heat and humidity the wood soon splits. Because of their solid bodies, electric guitars are less susceptible to the weather. 'I built it piece by piece when I wasn't out on missions,' explains Dobbins, who has the calm air and physical presence of a man twice his age. 'I look at other guitars in the store and they're all shiny, but I like mine better because I built it myself.' To solve the amplification problem he bought an Eighties Fender amp and an effects peddle.</p> <p>During his first deployment, Dobbins had become fast friends with another soldier, Kenny Rojas, with whom he shared a passion for playing the guitar. Rojas would often come to his quarters to borrow his old acoustic guitar or talk music and Dobbins would work on his playing, emulating his heroes, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Eric Clapton his black-and-white Fender is based on one he once saw Clapton play on a music DVD.</p> <p>Today, with Dobbins gently strumming his guitar in his small flat outside Savannah, Georgia, where he lives with his wife, a former retail manager from New York, and their two labradors, which must be locked in cages in the kitchen before we enter (one has a tendency to pee everywhere in excitement), the war seems very far away. But the memories are still painful.</p> <p>'We were getting run ragged,' Dobbins had explained earlier as we sat in a shabby sandwich joint outside the gates of Fort Stewart, a vast military base an hour's drive from Savannah. The remnants of tropical storm Fay were playing out in bursts of heavy rain which lashed the parking lot where he had parked his customised Mustang (white and black, like his guitar) while inside a soldier played a videogame, shooting zombies in the corner. Over the counter hung a sign offering a Soldier Sub packed with meat and cheese and 10 per cent off for all military personnel in uniform. Dobbins had ignored his sandwich, his small grey eyes locked on a point somewhere in the middle distance as he recalled the night his friend Rojas had died.</p> <p>'We'd been getting two to three hours sleep a night,' he said, 'and one night in October 2005 when we were supposed to have the night off I took some sleeping pills. Before I went to bed I felt drunk because the medicine was taking over and I went to sleep. But three hours later they came and shook me awake because they needed a Humvee driver.'</p> <p>After protesting that he was in no fit state to drive, Dobbins was ordered into his vehicle, donned his night-vision goggles and roared out of the compound, the third in a convoy en route to intercept some high-value targets. As he left he recalls one of the medics joking, 'Don't hit anything tonight, Dobbins!' A short time later, the rear nearside wheel dropped into a pothole detonating a double stack of landmines. The armoured vehicle erupted in a blinding flash of white light and the next thing Dobbins knew he was waking on the roadside with bruising to 90 per cent of his body, one ear damaged and the Humvee in flames beside him.</p> <p>'My whole body was numb. I got up and limped towards the Humvee. A colleague was circling with blood dripping from his face. I shouted but he didn't react and I really thought I was a ghost. I thought I was dead.' In the mangled wreckage lay the body of his best friend. 'I didn't know there was anyone back there. He wasn't meant to be there.' They were both rushed back to the base and Dobbins remembers fighting off the doctors who were trying to give him morphine, desperate to know of Rojas's fate. 'I guess he died slightly after midnight.'</p> <p>With his friend gone and the memories still raw, Dobbins picked up his guitar and started playing, releasing his emotions, grieving. At that time he thought about something his godmother had said when he was in his teens and struggling to cope with problems in his family: 'People need music; it helps you get through your day.'</p> <p>'I'm still going to see a therapist,' he tells me quietly, 'still trying to deal with it. And I just play. Music's a big release for me; I just pick up a guitar and start playing. If I'm angry or sad I just feel better playing guitar.'</p> <p>Conflict is no stranger to creative endeavour. The First World War produced great poetry, the Spanish Civil War great literature, and in Iraq a vast number of young soldiers - brought up on videogames, free music downloads, YouTube and dubbed Generation Kill by Rolling Stone magazine - are turning to music as a way of making sense of their war. Everyone has an iPod or CD player and laptops and video cameras are common. Humvees are routinely jerry-rigged with tinny speakers and even sub-woofers, zip-tied to the ceiling, which pump out rock music as units charge into battle. And because you now don't need expensive equipment or a professional studio to record music, these soldiers, armed with just a microphone and a copy of home-recording software such as GarageBand, can produce a song in the combat zone and email it home.</p> <p>When he returned from his own tour of duty in Iraq in January 2006, Sean Gilfillan - who lost seven of his friends and comrades - was shocked at what he calls 'the disconnect between civilians and returning members of the military.'</p> <p>'If you didn't want to know about the war in Iraq,' says Gilfillan, who was part of the first occupying force to enter Baghdad after the fall of the city in 2003, 'you could ignore it. Only 9 per cent of the US population has any experience of serving in the military. The other 91 per cent have no idea.' In an attempt to bridge this gap and humanise the soldiers, Gilfillan decided to set up a label to put out music made by members of the US armed forces as a tribute to their fallen comrades and to reach out to the general population.</p> <p>To The Fallen Records was founded in January 2007 by Gilfillan and business partner Sidney DeMello and takes its name from the large tattoo Gilfillan had etched across his back to honour his friends who had died. The label offers a conduit of expression for young men and women whose voices are never normally heard in an attempt to expunge the stereotype of the typical American soldier.</p> <p>The pair acquired 'debt up to our eyeballs' to get their project off the ground, explains Gilfillan, and are now looking for a second round of venture capital and a pairing with a major label to help expand and get the music out to more people. 'We're a non-profit organisation in everything but name,' he says. 'We feel that the American public is ready to hear from these talented musicians, but we need a major label partner to make that happen.'</p> <p>There is certainly a vast pool of talent keen to embrace the label. The fledgling imprint now has a database of 1,500 military artists (unusually, the label is not just about releasing the best music, but providing a platform for all soldiers who want advice or guidance with their music) and has worked with more than 50 performers to put out three compilation albums - Hip-Hop Vol 1 , Rock Vol 1 (on which Dobbins's song, 'Tribute to the Fallen', about his friend Rojas appears) and Country Vol 1. They now plan to release further mix CDs that cover every genre.</p> <p>The response from the top brass has also been encouraging. 'The military bosses love it,' says the 29-year-old Gilfillan. 'They really see the benefit of the soldiers expressing themselves as long as they do it professionally and not offensively. It's good for the image of the military and they realise they can't censor soldiers who are fighting for freedom of expression.' A number of acts were recently invited to play at the Pentagon where, as one put it, they were 'treated like movie stars', and although no plans are in place for them to return to Iraq to entertain the troops, it's something Gilfillan would like to see happen.</p> <p>'Music is all about social issues, about grassroots, about authenticity and nothing is more grassroots, authentic and patriotic than music by members of the military,' says Gilfillan. 'One of the hardest things about being in Iraq or Afghanistan is that when a friend is killed you have to go out the next day to the same spot. You don't get a break. It can take a heavy toll on you and you have to deal with that at some point. I think music in this situation can be very therapeutic.'</p> <p>Josh Revak, 27, a former sergeant with the 1st Armoured Division who fought in Baghdad, Falluja, Karbala and Ramadi, is one of Gilfillan's artists with a song on the Country Vol 1 compilation - 'Empty Boots'. He has also released an album - In the Hours of Darkness - under the moniker Crutchhiker, which he recorded with the Grand Ole Opry house band. It's a moving record that touches on the transitory nature of life and asks big questions about the greater plan for us all in a bitter, raw and emotionally charged style. Revak's experience is a testament to the role music can play in war.</p> <p>In 2003 he and a friend wrote a song in Baghdad when a friend called Tim Hayslett was killed. 'We were devastated, absolutely crushed,' he explains, 'and when the sergeant major heard we'd written a song he asked us to perform it at the memorial service.' The difference between this service and previous memorials was clear. 'Soldiers were weeping, they were venting and grieving,' says Revak. 'Previous memorials had been dry-eyed and professional, which is not a word that I'd like to associate with a memorial service. You need to grieve or you'll lose your mind and I believe that the music helped with post-traumatic stress disorder.'</p> <p>After that first performance, the sergeant major effectively ordered Revak to play at every subsequent memorial. His moving, deeply personal songs provided a conduit for the soldiers' grief. 'It was hard because we knew we'd have to write and perform these songs, but we didn't know who'd be killed next. It was very stressful. Each time it was a closer friend.'</p> <p>During his second deployment, Revak would often sit in his unit's postroom writing and recording songs with his best friend Aaron Jagger. They played all of the memorials together, sharing the burden of songwriting duties. Then, one morning while providing armoured support to a team building a combat outpost in Ramadi, Revak and another colleague came under mortar fire.</p> <p>'We had got to a rendezvous point and everyone was out of the vehicles,' recalls the blond Revak sitting in the Veterans of Foreign Wars post (VFW, an American organisation similar to the Royal British Legion) near his home in Minnesota. He had been out late the night before, singing around a campfire at a friend's party and he's hungover and wearing mirrored shades, his voice cracking as he talks. 'A mortar round fell about 100 yards away and my friend and I decided to get back into our vehicle. As we were doing so a second mortar round fell on the other side of the vehicle. My friend didn't make it and I took shrapnel through my ankle. The doctor said he could see right through it.'</p> <p>Revak was shipped out to the military hospital at Landstuhl, Germany, where his unit was based and Jagger arranged the delivery of his guitar as he had surgery to rebuild his shattered ankle using bone grafts from his pelvis. While he was in hospital another friend was killed and then, just as he was leaving to begin a year-long rehabilitation as an outpatient, news arrived that Jagger, his best friend and companion at all those memorial services, had also been killed. 'He was an amazing musician,' says Revak, choking up at the memory. 'His was the last memorial service I played and writing and singing that song for him is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I was crushed. I really miss him.'</p> <p>Although it was a particularly painful experience, today Revak looks back gratefully at his performances at these memorials. 'I've met a lot of Vietnam veterans,' he says, looking about the run-down interior of his VFW post, which is lined with flags, a poster advertising a meat raffle and, sitting at the bar beneath a sign stating that vulgar language will not be tolerated, a veteran who has headphones on and is swearing loudly to himself before being told to turn it down. 'I knew I didn't want any feelings locked up. I want it all out. These songs I hold dear to my heart. Performing them was beneficial to me and those around me.'</p> <p>In the gloomy basement of an old wooden house in Chicago that he shares with his young wife Josseline, Isaiah Santopoalo is standing before a large US flag pinned to the brickwork. Beside him is a microphone and in the corner his computer gently hums, its screen emitting a pale glow. This is his recording studio where the clean-cut, dark-haired Santopoalo recorded his hip-hop tracks covering everything from the lot of struggling single mothers to turning away from the temptations of Chicago street life; to a song called 'Moving On' which came out of his first deployment to Iraq.</p> <p>Santopoalo saw fierce fighting with the 5/73rd Cavalry of the 82nd Airborne in the battle of Turki village, near Baquba, about 30 miles north-east of Baghdad in the murderous Sunni Triangle in 2006. He lost close friends and although he was officially released from the military in February 2008, he is still going to counselling and occasionally suffers flashbacks. 'I have good days and I have bad days,' he says quietly.</p> <p>Although just 24, Santopoalo has been involved in some of the key events of recent US history. He joined the army just two weeks before the attack on the Twin Towers and was later posted to New York. Then, in 2005, he was in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina before his deployment to Iraq. Through it all he carried his love of music, which had been fostered by his stepfather, also a former member of the 82nd Airborne, from the age of around 12.</p> <p>He played Beatles and Prince records oldies were goodies, says Santopoalo, who remembers seeing his fathers medals and donning his old fatigues to go and play at soldiers in the woods. Upstairs are display cases full of his fathers Beatles memorabilia. I'd sit and listen to his music all night through headphones, rewinding and trying to recite the lyrics. On the streets of Chicago he developed a love of hip hop the Roots, DMX and particularly Bone Thugs-N-Harmony spoke to him and he started emulating his rap heroes. It made me look at my life and think about how I could express it.</p> <p>In the army, Santopoalo held on to his love of music, dreaming up lyrics for raps while on patrol, sitting on sentry duty or manning his .50-calibre gun, saving up the lines until he was somewhere safe where he could jot down his songs. He would gather his colleagues round and free-style as he'd seen Bone Thugs-N-Harmony do in a video when he was younger. He spent most of his time on his two deployments in Iraq out in the field, far from Camp Warhorse, the nearest forward operating base, often engaging insurgents in action. But during those rare hours back in the relative safety of base hed make use of the satellite phones to call one of his collaborators back in Chicago to rap lines down the phone and request a beat. Over time these long-distance songs took shape and during one brief visit to the camp he signed up for a talent show.</p> <p>It was the first time Id ever performed and I was extremely nervous, he says, but I popped on the mix and did the song and got rave reviews. Not only did he have a touch of stage fright but, as the stage was lit up, the performers were worried about being mortared. But once the music started that all pretty much went out the window and everybody was focused on the stage. Its probably the closest Ill ever be to stardom, he jokes. All the girls were coming up to me afterwards asking where I stay. I did a few more songs and ended up scheduling a full-blown concert.</p> <p>Earlier this month officials met in Ramadi, once a hotbed of insurgent activity about 70 miles west of Baghdad where Santopoalo had fought, to hand over control of the vast eastern Anbar province to the Iraqi authorities. As America prepares to go to the polls in November, talk about phased withdrawals of troops becomes ever louder.</p> <p>Meanwhile, for these soldiers who, by their own admission, are still piecing together their lives and readjusting to civilian life, politics a once distant and academic business is now very relevant. Politics mattered to us in Iraq, says Santopoalo. 'We'd hear McCain or Bush talking about how the surge was working and many of the guys would discuss who they thought was telling the truth. In the end, unfortunately, you're faced with the decisions politicians make.'</p> <p>'As a label, we are non-partisan', says Gilfillan. We wouldn't have anything that is overwhelmingly anti-right wing or anti-left wing, but everyone has their view and is allowed to express it through their music and many of the soldiers you'll hear are pro-military but anti-war.'</p> <p>'McCain wants to go back to Iraq,' says Dobbins, 'and I don't.' Santopoalo has had his eyes opened to how much of the world perceives America. 'I think were a spoiled society,' he says wearily. 'To come home and hear people complaining about the most minute things waiting in line, not having enough hot water is very disconcerting.' He sees Obama as the one man able to rebuild the country's image in the rest of the world.</p> <p>Revak, however, has gone in a different direction. He had never paid much attention to politics until he started meeting Vietnam veterans who had been prisoners of war with John McCain, who was due in town the following week for the Republican National Convention. 'When I got back to the US I started to pay pretty close attention to the presidential race. I met Leo Thorsness and Dave Wheat who had both been PoWs with McCain and I started to learn about what had happened. After talking to these guys, it became real, not just a political campaign.'</p> <p>He says the final straw came when Obama cancelled a visit to meet wounded soldiers at the hospital in Landstuhl where hed received treatment. Obama had been advised by the Pentagon not to go, but, says Revak, 'It really started to upset me.'</p> <p>Revak also has fond memories of the Iraqi people. 'It was great to get out, me and my buddy dancing with Iraqis in the city square in full uniform.' Music was a way of connecting with the Iraqi soldiers they worked alongside and the Iraqi people they met. And wherever they went, Michael Jackson was a firm favourite.</p> <p>But music also soundtracked the war. There was pumping rock music to fire up the soldiers before they drove into battle and, as Dobbins says, 'It'd be a big thing for us all to prepare the playlist together before we went out a bit like in the film Blade where the girl puts together a playlist before going out to kill vampires.' Santopoalo, however, drew the line at actually listening to music while fighting: 'The battle was the music.'</p> <p>At other times there was a more personal soundtrack. 'There's a group of songs that remind me of my time in Iraq in the same way there are songs that remind me of college,' says Gilfillan, now a captain in the US Army Reserves and running the label full-time. 'When my friend Rob died, I remember listening to songs over and over again I listened to \"Mad World\" by Gary Jules and when I hear that now, I think about Rob.'</p> <p>Music has taken on a transcendental purpose now for these former soldiers. 'Before I'd write comedies, funny love songs. They were terrible,' says Revak, laughing. 'But in the military, music took on a whole new meaning. I've always loved playing, but I've never been any good until now. Nothing mattered until I wrote about life and death.'</p> <h2>Sgt.

  "<p>In the run-up to the Democratic National Convention, country singer John Rich declared at a Republican rally in Florida that Johnny Cash would have backed John McCain. 'Somebody's got to walk the line in the country,' Rich said. 'They've got to walk it unapologetically. And I'm sure Johnny Cash would have been a John McCain supporter.' Rosanne Cash, the Man in Black's daughter, issued a statement responding to Rich's claim. </p> <p>'It is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my father's name, five years after his death, to ascribe beliefs, ideals, values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined, and to try to further their own agendas by doing so,' the country singer wrote on her website. 'This is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation.' The Republican campaign machine has also infuriated John Mellencamp and Jackson Browne (who is suing) by using their songs for election purposes without permission.</p> <p>Speaking exclusively to OMM, Cash, a fine artist in her own right, adds: 'There are a lot of things that I read about my father that I let pass. This I just couldn't let pass. It's their presumption that's so galling. My father was a real human being with a lot of political passion and his own ideas. Even though he's been gone five years, it's not OK to borrow his beliefs - or what you assume to be his beliefs. </p> <p>'If I had initially responded by saying things that I know to be true about his political beliefs then I would have been doing the same thing - co-opting his views for my own agenda, and that's still not fair, even though I'm his daughter. I've always tried to restrain myself - I only said recently how opposed he was to the invasion of Iraq.</p> <p>'I think the Republicans' actions are fairly considered. They're aggressive. It's a take no prisoners approach - try it and see if it sticks.</p> <p>'It's a Republican theme to paint Obama as just a celebrity, which is ridiculous. Do people really care about celebrity endorsements anyway? I'm not going to vote for someone just because Barbra Streisand says she likes him. But then I should say at this point that I support Obama! Right now, the election is closer than it ought to be. It's stunning to me that people would even consider voting for McCain. But I've been wrong before.'</p>",
  "<p><strong>Now or Later</strong><br>Royal Court, London SW1</p> <p><strong>Kicking a Dead Horse</strong><br>Almeida, London N1</p> <p>Christopher Shinn's new play is a theatrical paradox: it's Shavian but snappy. Only 70 minutes, and pungently written, it's packed (over-packed) with debate. It has a persuasive emotional aspect; the ending, finely staged by Dominic Cooke, is a well-judged surprise. And it's cannily scheduled: its concerns could hardly be more current.</p> <p>On the eve of a US election, the gay son of the Democratic presidential candidate goes to a party dressed as Muhammad. His dad's supporters think he should apologise before video material becomes public. The boy argues he was acting in the interests of free speech, to expose a fellow student who wanted to censor satire directed at Islam. But he's also rebelling because of his family history: even his birth, he claims, was a media-sensitive decision by his parents. </p> <p>In researching Now or Later, Shinn was helped by meetings with Cherie Blair and Hillary Clinton's head of communications. Matthew Marsh is very good as the about-to-be-President, suggesting the lustre of power as well as its damage; Eddie Redmayne, volatile and coltish, vividly projects distress and intelligence. Still, there's a hole at the centre: this boy, who's spent a lifetime complaining about his parents' way of going on, is now supposed to be astonished by their response to his actions.</p> <p>Kicking A Dead Horse is American writing at its posturing cowboy worst: Beckett in a stetson. This Abbey Theatre production of Sam Shepard's play, written for Stephen Rea, features a Manhattan art dealer who, having chucked his canvases out of the window, decides to head for the Badlands so that he can bray about Authenticity. His horse (and who can blame him?) pops his horseshoes, and spends the evening with his plastic-looking hoofs in the air. A girl in a mini-dress comes up from a fissure to simper. All Rea has to do is grumble. He does so with lovely, lugubrious confidentiality, but it's impossible to make these speeches interesting. Talk about flogging a supine equine.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Stevie Wonder</strong> <br>O2 Arena, London SE10 </p> <p>Around the time when Tony Blair was freshly enthroned as Prime Minister and Bill Clinton was the as yet unsullied President of the world, there was much talk of the rock'n'roll generation coming into power. Unlike previous ruling classes, these were world leaders who had first-hand knowledge of popular music. They could play electric guitar. They might have even inhaled. They, surely, would never lead the world into another Vietnam, or worse.</p> <p>How naive we were. Either rock had taught these men nothing or they had forgotten all of it. There was also, of course, the possibilty that rock itself was not as revolutionary a genre as we had all assumed. </p> <p>Now another American election brings the hope not just of a rock'n'roll President, but a soul President. A funk President. A jazz President. A president with an iPod, who knows Stevie Wonder's back catalogue inside out. Not for Barack Obama, some ill-thought-out endorsement of the Arctic Monkeys; Obama is down with Stevie, for real. 'When I was at that point where you start getting involved in music,' the Democratic presidential hopeful told Rolling Stone recently, 'Stevie had that run with Music of My Mind, Talking Book, Fulfillingness' First Finale and Innervisions, then Songs in the Key of Life. Those are as brilliant a set of five albums as we've ever seen.' No, Obama didn't just get a greatest hits CD last Christmas.</p> <p>The feeling is mutual. Wonder, now a portly 58, has described Obama as a cross between John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. He has played at Obama rallies, and at the recent Democratic convention (along with John Legend, whom you might describe as Wonder's wannabe mini-me). </p> <p>It's no surprise, then, that Wonder's London gig comes peppered with Obama endorsements. 'Master Blaster (Jammin')', Wonder's 1980 ode to Bob Marley now contains the line 'Barack Obama's gonna be the next President', and at the end Wonder invokes God's blessing for him. As Britons aren't yet able to vote in the United States presidential elections, we probably escape lightly. </p> <p>In a sentimental, rambling aside that takes in the Martin Luther King national holiday in the US, the end of apartheid and his 'lovely' daughter, Aisha Morris (now one of his backing singers), Wonder tonight ascribes his latest two-year bout of touring as a reaction to his mother's death in 2006. (God, apparently, needed her more than Stevie did; now she is an angel, watching over us all. Sometime later she came to Wonder in a dream and told him to 'get his ass on the road'.)</p> <p>But there is no ignoring the frisson of electricity running through black music in the US at the moment, and, specifically, through Stevie Wonder, long an activist, and now court musician to the Sun King-to-be. Buoyed by liberal America's Obama-mania, he is in expansive mode. Led onstage by Aisha, beat-boxing into a microphone, he takes up the harmonica, paying tribute to Miles Davis's 'All Blues', into which he manages to work in the melody from 'London Bridge Is Falling Down', charming everyone from the off. </p> <p>When, finally, he mines his rich vein of peak-period hits in the final half hour, the aisles fill with the dancing figures of black, white, young and old. 'Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours' gives way to the irresistible lift of 'Sir Duke'. It's soon followed by 'Uptight (Everything's Alright)' and the peerless 'Superstition', played just like you remember them. Not for Wonder the endless rearranging indulged in by stars bored of their hits: he plays them all straight, if far too perfunctorily.</p> <p>Bizarrely, he interrupts this magisterial flow to ask for a moment of silence for the victims of 9/11. As an afterthought, Wonder amends it to include all unnecessary deaths in all wars throughout history. There is no doubting his sincerity. But for all the energy coursing through Wonder, his two-hour show suffers from a lack of focus and unforgivably bad pacing. Can you be struck down by God for insinuating that Stevie Wonder lacks a sense of rhythm? I'm braced.</p> <p>If you have a ticket for the forthcoming run of shows, you could do worse than just turn up around 9.15. You'll miss the rush-hour traffic, the queues for food and drink, and the long-winded run-up of ballads, the band solos, and the surfeit of call-and-response vocal warm-ups with the audience. ('You sound like my church!' Wonder gushes.) </p> <p>The interminable, mawkish ballads aren't all rotten - a brilliant version of 'Lately' has an older woman in floods of tears, with many others not far off - but they dominate two thirds of what should be an electrifying gig in Wonder's first European jaunt in 10 years. One interminable jazz-funk workout finds every band member taking a solo. It is close to torture, as two percussionists, two guitarists, the drummer, the bassist, the saxophonist, the trumpet-player and two keyboard players each funk out individually. At \u00a365 a ticket, this is indulgent, to say the least. </p> <p>Not even Wonder's deployment of a voice-bag vocoder can really get things moving, until 'Higher Ground' makes an appearance about seven songs in. Every time Wonder gets the crowd excited with a song played on the clavinet, he immediately follows it with a syrupy ballad on the piano, prompting everyone to sit down again. It's like church - but not in a good way. </p> <p>The amateurish visuals make several tedious songs worse. While many of tonight's tracks are lit up by laughably bad digital screensaver whorls, 'Golden Lady' features no less than a silhouette of a golden woman dancing. </p> <p>Perhaps the gig's nadir, 'Ribbon in the Sky' ('Ribbon! In the sky! Rrrrrrribbon! Rrrrribon! Rrribbit!' Wonder scats, in a very long coda) is illustrated by a red and gold ribbon flying through outer space. It may be in poor taste to note that Wonder might not have much input into this section of his show, but someone, somewhere needs to tell him that his music deserves better. If Obama is elected President of the United States, and Wonder has his ear, we can only hope that it is the questing, visionary Wonder he heeds, and not the comfortable, middle-aged star who has lost his sense of rhythm.</p> <h2>Vox pop</h2> <p>Did Stevie manage to bring the sunshine back into your life?</p> <p><strong>Sean Christian</strong><br>47, careworker</p> <p>It's brilliant to see Stevie back on stage and on top form.

He really controlled the crowd.</p> <p><strong>Lorna Driver</strong><br>29, full-time mum</p> <p>I'm 29 and this was my first ever concert. It was excellent.

I got Stevie's first album, Uptight, when I was 15 and I've been a fan ever since. I loved the age-range of the crowd tonight - it's nice that there are new fans coming in.</p> <p><strong>Nicky Garratt</strong><br>39, office manager</p> <p>Overall it was a great night, but slow in places. It was mostly a show for couples - a few of them needed to get rooms! But I did phone my mum when he played 'Lately', and had a cry.</p> <p><strong>Interviews by Imogen Carter</strong></p>",
  "<p>In the transient media parlance, Gordon Ramsay is a 'rock star' chef, Dan Snow is a 'rock star' historian and Sarah Palin is now a 'rock star' politician. In the case of Dr Brian Cox, the soubriquet is not so much tired as justified. The scientist who leapt to ubiquity last week, enthusing over what he describes as mankind's 'biggest project since Apollo', had a previous life in a Nineties band with regular gigs on Top of the Pops.</p> <p>Cox played keyboards for D:Ream for the last time in May 1997. The occasion was New Labour's election night party at the Royal Festival Hall, and the song was 'Things Can Only Get Better'. In the years that followed, Britain got Blair and physics got its own ambitious, telegenic communicator in Cox. Today, as Blair's heir is apparently sucked into a black hole, Cox is poised to slip the surly bonds of geekiness and become the god of small things.</p> <p>A youthful 40, without a boffin whisker in sight, and articulating in the kind of regional accent that TV executives find 'warm', Cox became the acceptable face of physics last week when the world's most powerful particle experiment was switched on at the Cern international science centre. In vast underground caverns near Geneva, the \u00a35bn Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where Cox works on a particle detector called Atlas, has begun recreating the conditions present in the universe less than a billionth of a second after the big bang.</p> <p>The event captured the public imagination, or at least the media's, on the day with blanket coverage on Radio 4 and an image on Google's homepage, which the internet company told Cox will have been seen by around half a billion people. To Cox himself fell the role of public oracle, conveying the strange beauty and violence of subatomic particles, and making unfathomably complex science accessible to the man in the street via BBC2's Newsnight, Radio 4, Australia's equivalent of Friday Night with Jonathan Ross and countless other media.</p> <p>He reeled off facts and figures of undeniable wow factor: the accelerator's circumference of 27 kilometres, buried about 100 metres underground; the temperature inside the tube, -271C, colder than space, making it the biggest fridge in the world; a proton beam whizzing around one way - 11,000 times a second, with as much energy as an aircraft carrier going at 30mph - and another proton beam whizzing around the other way; the beams smashing together up to 600 million times a second.</p> <p>Among the aims of the biggest experiment of all time: to isolate the elusive Higgs boson, or 'God particle', which gives the matter in the universe its mass. As Cox put it, with his gift for user-friendly terms, that really means: why is this table solid?</p> <p>Some marginal scientists warned that the LHC might conjure a black hole that would gobble up the entire planet, a gift to any headline writer who ever dreamt of plastering 'End of the world is nigh' on sandwich boards. Cox and his colleagues received cranky emails including implied death threats. Eventually, as peeved as Richard Dawkins at a convention of creationists, he delivered a blunt riposte: 'Anyone who thinks the LHC will destroy the world is a twat.'</p> <p>In this plain-speaking professor from Manchester University, television might have discovered its evangelist for science. Just as history has fresh-faced Tristram Hunt or Bettany Hughes brimming with passion for the subject, so Cox's enthusiasm for physics could be the biggest boost for the subject since David Tennant flourished a sonic screwdriver in Doctor Who. He has the looks, the likes-a-drink-or-two street cred, and still a lingering rebellious streak: he married his American wife, glamorous TV presenter Gia Milinovich, in secret. She runs a blog where threads include a discussion of whether her husband is gay (he isn't). </p> <p>Cox has also been making a good fist of one of television's toughest assignments: presenting a subject matter so tiny that no one can see it. Professor Sir Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal and president of the Royal Society, said yesterday: 'As an astronomer I'm lucky to work in a subject where there is already public interest, and where it's not too difficult to convey the key ideas and new discoveries in a non-technical and accessible way. It's far harder to make particle physics accessible and interesting. Brian Cox is one of the few scientists who succeed in doing this, and I much admire him for it.'</p> <p>It all began with a boy inspired by rockets, spacemen and the mysteries of night sky. Even at the age of one, he has been told, he was fascinated by the moon landings, and he remains enchanted by the phrase 'Apollo's children', a generation who grew up to become scientists and engineers (he hopes that the LHC might have the same galvanising effect). For Christmas he wanted a telescope, and he dreamt of flying to Mars.</p> <p>He recalls a happy childhood in Oldham that included geeky pursuits such as plane spotting and even bus spotting. But at 16 he discovered music and 'went completely the other way', going to nightclubs and gigs and ending up with a grade D in his maths A-level. Cox became a keyboard player with local rock band Dare, formed by former Thin Lizzy's Darren Wharton. They went on tour but broke up after a fight in a Berlin bar. Cox came home, called Manchester University and told them: 'Right, I want to come to university now and do physics.' He was 23.</p> <p>But he wasn't finished with music. In 1993 he joined D:Ream 'by accident' and achieved something like stardom. The band were nominated for the MTV Europe music awards and the Brit Awards for Artists of the Year in 1994, and Cox made his Top of the Pops debut in an unforgettable tartan suit. It was different from the typical student existence of pubs, libraries and dank flats. Cox has recalled: 'Once I was in the lab all day and when I finished I walked up the road to support Take That at the G-Mex in Manchester. My friends at university just thought it was so funny.'</p> <p>D:Ream's dance hit 'Things Can Only Get Better' reached number one in the UK in January 1994 and gained a second lease of life as the New Labour anthem during the 1997 election. But Cox found he could no longer fully combine his twin careers and had to back out of D:Ream's Australian tour so he could finish his physics degree. He gained first class honours and stayed at Manchester to pursue a PhD, attending lectures given by Jeff Forshaw, a professor of particle physics. 'He was a breath of fresh air - he'd done something else with his life,' Forshaw recalls. 'The first impression was of someone enthusiastic and very capable. We worked together during his PhD, have written a lot of papers together since then. We spend a lot of time drinking wine and beer and talking physics.'</p> <p>Certainly Cox, who has lobbied the government over cuts to research budgets, never regretted the decision to quit music: 'After about five years' touring, it's not glamorous any more, it's just knackering.' In fact he now travels more than ever, giving talks and lectures around the world. He has a flowering media career on Radio 4 and with BBC television's Horizon, as well as writing for magazines and newspapers. He idolises the late Carl Sagan, the great populariser of astronomy, and would love to emulate his series Cosmos.</p> <p>He was also hired as scientific adviser on the sci-fi film Sunshine, directed by Danny Boyle of Trainspotting fame. Boyle said: 'He somehow makes it accessible and puts it in human terms.' Cox worked closely with the cast including Irish actor Cillian Murphy, who played the ship's young physicist and, somewhat similar in appearance, became Cox's fictional alter ego.</p> <p>Cox now divides his time between Oldham and London, where his wife lives with 11-year-old Moki, her son from a previous marriage. The couple's first date was on 11 September 2001, and they married four years ago in her mother's front room in Duluth, Minnesota. He only told his own parents when he got back. 'I'm a northern man. I don't like any fuss,' he explains. Milinovich's most recent blog post says touchingly: 'There have been many times over the years when I've been extremely proud of my lovely husband. His appearance on Newsnight is right at the bloody top of the list.'</p> <p>When in Geneva, he uses computer 'iChat' to keep in touch with Gia and Moki before going for dinner. A recent newspaper article, in which he described rambling back to his room having usually drunk about a bottle of Ch\u00e2teauneuf du Pape, annoyed his colleagues who said it implied that Cern was a tax-funded drinking den. Cox admits that he hates waking up in the morning, staying in bed until 9am if he can. But he is hardly unfit, running half-marathons and playing football with university colleagues; he used to have a season ticket at Oldham Athletic. These days his taste in music is jazz and singers such as Billie Holiday.</p> <p>Cern's grand experiment may or may not reveal the secrets of creation. In the meantime, Cox believes the revival of science in the national culture will do. The BBC is planning to bring back a popular science strand in the tradition of Tomorrow's World and will need a presenter. Don't bet against this D:Reamer getting the job.</p> <h2>The Cox lowdown</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> in Oldham, Greater Manchester, 3 March 1968. His parents were bankers. Married to Gia Milinovich, a TV presenter and new media consultant, and has an 11-year-old stepson, Moki. He lives with them in a house in London and on his own in a flat near Oldham. When working at Cern, he stays at a Holiday Inn at the foothills of the Jura mountains in France.</p> <p><strong>Best of times</strong> Now. For Cox, professor of particle physics at Manchester university, and other scientists working on it, the Large Hadron Collider is an 'Apollo moment', the chance of a generation. It could be his ticket to a career as champion populariser of physics in the media.</p> <p><strong>Worst of times</strong> Cox started university late and combined the physics lab with playing keyboard for D:Ream. This led to a career crisis when the band went on tour to Australia, forcing him to choose between pop and physics. He stayed in Manchester and finished his degree. </p> <p><strong>What he says</strong> 'The LHC really has the chance to change our view of the world in the way that Copernicus, Newton and Einstein did.'</p> <p><strong>What others say</strong> 'There is a danger that the media work takes over and Brian's well aware of it, but he's passionate about the way science is seen, and communicating this whole process has immense value.' <strong>Professor Jeff Forshaw</strong>, friend and colleague at Manchester university</p>",
  "<p>To many Europeans, especially of a liberal bent, the emergence of Sarah Palin as one of the dominant forces in American politics is a cause for dismay.</p> <p>At first glance she seems to represent the triumph of the personal over the political. Her looks are remarked upon, her fashions critiqued. For supporters her status as a mother of five is touted as her greatest virtue. For others the Palin family is a source of sniping gossip. Her breezy, straight-talking style is hailed by admirers as a key to unlocking the vital support of the latest fad in polling demographics: Wal-Mart Moms. Others see it as a sign of a political ingenue possessing little in the way of sophistication beyond her background as a small town mayor.</p> <p>This is to overlook the substance of her beliefs. Palin represents an extreme form of conservatism. She is not just anti-abortion, she opposes abortion even in cases of rape or incest. And Palin supports the introduction of creationist ideas into the classroom, alongside evolution. She is sceptical of global warming, only recently accepting that human activities might play a role, flying in the face of vast bodies of scientific opinion - even the US government's own advisers. She is pro-drilling for oil in environmentally sensitive areas in a world that needs to wean itself away from fossil fuels. Her grasp of foreign policy is limited to a series of hawkish and naive soundbites on Russia, terrorism and Iran.</p> <p>America has had eight years of a government that has held similar views. The result has been to put ideological and emotional distance between it and large parts of Europe, Asia and Latin America. Apart from isolationist Republicans, this is bad news both for America and the rest of us. America needs a friendlier world to do economic and political business. The world needs an America more in tune with its natural friends and allies.</p> <p>The political beliefs exemplified by Palin and her fellow religious conservatives are not the answer, no matter how well presented by her considerable political skills.</p> <p>Change is the watchword of the American election. But McCain, in putting Palin on his ticket, is trying to pull off an audacious con trick. Palin does not represent change, but more of the same. And then some.</p>",
  "<p>There are two ways of reacting to the Royal Society's claim that its education director Michael Reiss was misrepresented in reports alleging he thought creationism should be taught in science classrooms. Either journalists got it wrong or Reiss - an ordained Church of England clergyman - did indeed suggest religious dogma be mixed with science teaching. I tend very much to the latter view.</p> <p>As Sir Harry Kroto, a society fellow, and a Nobel prize winner, pointed out in a letter to the Royal Society, Reiss was an accident waiting to happen: 'I warned the president ... that his was a dangerous appointment. I did not realise just how dangerous it would turn out to be.'</p> <p>Now the society has been caught out, though in the short term it may ride out the current controversy. In the wake of Reiss's remarks, most commentaries have focused, quite reasonably, on the issue of how science and religion should be taught at school. At the same time, the Royal Society has rushed to assure scientists that it still believes creationism has no place in school laboratories.</p> <p>There is a second, more important issue at stake, however. How should the Royal Society, the world's oldest and most prestigious scientific organisation, treat religion within the confines of its own headquarters?</p> <p>Science and religion do mix, though the combination is often volatile - the reaction often depending, intriguingly, on the discipline studied by a particular researcher, according to Sir Tim Hunt, winner of the 2001 Nobel prize for medicine. 'Cosmologists and physicists dwell on cosmic forces which - if altered only slightly - would prevent many chemical reactions, and life, from occurring. The sheer improbability of our universe makes them all a bit spiritual and soft on religion. By contrast, biologists see evolution constantly at work in their research and are more hard-nosed about God.'</p> <p>The idea is not without exceptions, of course. Hunt, a biologist, is scarcely hardline about Reiss's creationism call, for example. 'I am not worried about this one, though I am definitely anti-religious.'</p> <p>But if he is unworried about God getting a foot in the Royal Society's door, many other fellows find recent developments troubling. Scientists such as Kroto, Sir Richard Roberts (another UK Nobel winner), and Richard Dawkins look with horror upon the spread of faith schools; the growing influence of bodies such as the Templeton Foundation, a conservative US organisation which constantly seeks to establish links between science and religion; and the prospect of creationism being taught in Britain's science classrooms. They expect the Royal Society to take a tough stand on these issues.</p> <p>Many of their fears are based on their American experiences, it should be noted. Kroto and Richards now work there while Dawkins is a frequent visitor on the US lecture circuit. And what they see in America unnerves them: school science teachers who firmly believe the world and humanity are the 6,000-year-old handiwork of God and who cannot accept what DNA tells us about our close relationships with the animal world, what isotope research reveals about the deep antiquity of our planet, what astronomical studies tell us about the size and age of the universe; and what fossils reveal about our own species' multimillion-year lineage. The prospect of such ignorance spreading to Britain quite rightly appals them.</p> <p>'I don't know if it is too late to stop the slide in Britain but I think it is in the US where they [the religious right] have now almost complete control over politics, the judiciary, education, business, journalism and television,' says Kroto. 'And it will only take a presidential victory by McCain, followed by him having a heart attack weeks later, and Sarah Palin, a creationist supporter, will become head of the world's most powerful country.'</p> <p>It is the duty of scientists to fight such onslaughts and be examples of rationality in a darkening world, it is argued. Hence the anger at the Royal Society for failing to firmly nail its colours to its mast. The organisation has a motto: 'Nullius in verba' (roughly, 'Take nobody's word for it'). In other words, verify everything by experiment and think for yourself. Both are noble aspirations. It is therefore baffling how an ordained minister - a man committed to believing the word of God without question - could have been asked to play a senior role in the society. Equally, the society's acceptance of money from the Templeton Foundation raises further concerns.</p> <p>The Royal Society - which should set the fiercest of examples in its commitment to rationality - has shown worrying signs of spiritual sloppiness. (Its current president, Lord Rees, is a cosmologist who attends church 'as an unbelieving Anglican', it should be noted.) Those of a religious persuasion might welcome this softening. I would sound a note of caution, however. Britain is still a broadly secular society which guarantees freedoms not just to atheists but to all religions, no matter how few its adherents. If we follow the example of America then all are threatened by the rise of a powerful Christian right.</p> <p>We badly need our premier scientific society to stand firm and present a clear vision of how our planet, our species, and the cosmos came into existence. It needs to be unequivocal about the wonders of nature as revealed through rational, scientific investigation. As Douglas Adams put it: 'Isn't enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe there are fairies at the bottom of it too?'</p>",

As the candidates enter this last leg of what has been a two year journey, a team from Guardian Films, investigative journalist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Ridgeway\">James Ridgeway</a> and I will begin another journey across the United States to talk to voters. We want to find out: Whither goest thou, America? And more importantly, why?</p> <p>We're still putting the finishing touches on our route, and I'll be talking about it more as it comes together. We hope to meet as many people along the way, and if you're interested in meeting us, <a href=\"mailto:kevin.anderson@guardian.co.uk\">drop me an e-mail</a>. I'll keep you posted on our plans and how you can take part. Even if we don't pass through your town or city - which is highly likely considering the size of the US - you can still join the conversation via the <a href=\"http://forum4editors.com/2008/09/us-odyssey-of-the-guardians-blogger/#more-644\">internet in ways that I'll be talking more about</a>. Until we leave, I'll be writing about the states we will visit and some of the issues.</p> <p>John <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/09/mccain_manager_this_election_i.html\">McCain's campaign manager Rick Davis</a> said:</p> <blockquote> <p>This election is not about issues. This election is about a composite view of what people take away from these candidates.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is some truth in that statement. Presidential elections in the United States aren't just about the issues. How many times did the smartest kid at school become class president?</p> <p>Having said that, I'd like to find a way to talk about the issues. What are the most important issues where you live? What are your neighbours talking about? If you live outside of the United States, what issues are you paying attention to? How do you think the election will affect your country?</p> <p>Here are some of the issue that I'm watching:</p> <p><strong>1. Health Care.</strong> The issue isn't simply about making sure that the 46 million uninsured Americans have care. It's also about how the hell is the US going to pay for it? In 1960, 1 of every 20 dollars were spent on healthcare. Now, it's <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/09/AR2008090902520.html\">one in every 6</a>.<br><strong>2. National Debt.</strong> It was high enough. The Congressional Budget Office is predicting the national debt to double to more than <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0911/p01s05-usec.html\">$5 trillion in the next 10 years.</a> That's more than <a href=\"http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/\">$31,700 for every US citizen</a>. Anyone want to add that to your credit card bill?<br><strong>3. It's the Economy stupid.</strong> Unemployment is rising and prices have risen. The US has been buoyed by exports, but as the the global economy slows, so will exports.</p> <p>The long and short of all of this is that the bills are going to come due just as the economy hits the skids around the world. Those are just some of the domestic issues that I'm watching.</p> <p>What answers do the candidates have? If you're listening to the mainstream media, all you've heard about the last week is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsOe87PcKMo\">lipstick and pigs</a>. \"The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that the Obama plan would cut taxes by $2.9 trillion over 2009-2018; the McCain plan would reduce taxes by nearly $4.2 trillion,\" writes <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0911/p01s05-usec.html\">Gail Russell Chaddock in the Christian Science Monitor</a>. OK, that's brilliant, but who is going to pay the bills?</p> <p>As I said, I'm interested in the issues that you're keeping an eye on whether you are a US voter (like me) or someone watching the election from abroad (also like me at the moment). It's going to be a fascinating trip, and I hope to see you on the road.</p> <p>Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/election2008,\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">election2008,</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/economy,\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">economy,</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/politics,\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">politics,</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/johnmccain,\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">johnmccain,</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/barackobama\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">barackobama</a></p>",
  "<p>I first heard about Siobhain McDonagh's challenge to Gordon Brown's leadership yesterday from an old Labour sweat, sacked but loyal, dripping with contempt for featherbrained colleagues who, as he put it, \"want to change the rules again\".</p> <p>McDonagh herself rang later while I was at the theatre, watching Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author, as it happens. That text could apply to Labour's rolling agony: Sixty Rebels in Search of a Candidate.</p> <p>My first reaction to any renewal of anti-Brown plot headlines triggered by the MP for Mitcham and Morden in south London is to say: \"Well, that one won't be going anywhere.\"</p> <p>McDonagh is a decent woman, a good constituency member, so assiduous with constituency mail that she was nicknamed \"Queen of the Stamps\". But to call an assistant whip a significant player is stretching things a bit even by today's standards of hype. I cannot remember her previously making headlines.</p> <p>Even \"member of the government\" is motoring a bit \u2013 which she no longer is since being dispatched quite properly by Geoff Hoon in mid-afternoon. Together with the <a href=\"http://www.progressives.org.uk/Magazine/article.asp?a=3351\">Progress article</a> \u2013 a coincidence apparently \u2013 signed by a dozen Blairish MPs and calling for a change of direction, it's a further blow to Brown, but not a fatal one. Unlike the Tories, Labour doesn't do fatal.</p> <p>When I returned Siobhain's call I was quickly reminded how disarmingly nice she is. Why had she acted in calling for a leadership contest? \"I want the kind of conversation you're having with loads of Labour MPs to be out in the open,\" she said. </p> <p>\"But I'm not having them, Siobhain. Not every Labour MP wants a leadership contest, many think they must stick with Gordon,\" I said.</p> <p>This is true, but she's right to say that lots \u2013 including some featherweights among the 313 MPs who nominated Brown barely a year ago \u2013 do want a challenge or a change.</p> <p>My line is that you don't try to overthrow a leader \u2013 be he/she a politician, a football manager or a CEO, even an editor for that matter \u2013 unless you have a candidate, if only in your private thoughts: it's not serious.</p> <p>McDonagh, a Blairite whose sister Margaret was once Labour's general secretary, says she doesn't have one. \"I want to find out if we do have any candidates. There may be a lot who are too frightened to say so.\"</p> <p>Aspirant leaders who are scared don't strike me as aspirant leadership material. Tony Blair, Bill Clinton, David Cameron, Senators Obama and McCain, they didn't need permission to take a long shot at the top job, did they? Siobhain says that's different: there was a contest open to them. Regicides don't inherit, she reminded me.</p> <p>We'll see. McDonagh says she's had lots of positive responses \u2013 \"constituents and friends ringing up, people in the pub\" \u2013 and that she acted on her own in writing privately to her boss, chief whip Hoon, 10 days ago. When Sky News got to hear about it, her choice was to confirm or deny it. She took the honest course.</p> <p>Good for her. But I don't see it changing the weather much, other than to add another small, dark cloud to the already glowering Brown sky. The procedures for getting rid of a sitting leader \u2013 let alone a PM \u2013 are hard and meant to be. Brown doesn't seem the type to walk; he has too strong a sense of duty and his own rectitude.</p> <p>Will a cabinet delegation or the kind of one-on-one session which finally persuaded Margaret Thatcher to go in 1990 emerge from this mess? I don't yet see it. More to the point, I don't see which alternative leader can change the political weather, unless you buy the argument that Labour will be destroyed under Brown and only beaten under AN Other. </p> <p>Miliband? Straw? Johnson? Balls? I try to imagine it, but can't yet.</p> <p>Far more damaging to Brown's reputation this week has surely been the overnight confirmation that when he said at his No 10 press conference that all pensioners would qualify for free home insulation he was wrong. Hilary Benn, too. Only the over-70s will get the help automatically, plus over-60s on benefits.</p> <p>Coming so soon after he refused Alistair Darling's advice to do something about the 10p tax rate problem, that's not an easily explained error by Mr Details. Brown wasn't as brilliant a chancellor as he and Blair kept telling us. But mistakes like that hurt \u2013 more than being hit with Siobhain McDonagh's handbag.</p>",
  "<p>Alaska's legislators shook up the presidential race yesterday with a vote to subpoena Todd Palin, the husband of Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, to question him about whether she sacked the state's police chief in order to settle a personal score.</p> <p>The demand to interview Todd Palin was the latest move in a state senate investigation into accusations that Sarah Palin dismissed state public safety commissioner Walter Monegan because he refused to sack a state trooper caught in a messy divorce with Palin's sister. Palin maintains she let Monegan go over a budget dispute.</p> <p>If the investigation finds that Palin used her influence as governor to further a family matter, it could threaten McCain's bid for the presidency. The Republican party has sought to portray Palin, Alaska's governor since December 2006, as a corruption fighter.</p> <p>Stephen Branchflower, the former prosecutor conducting the inquiry for the state senate, did not seek to subpoena the governor but has said he would like to interview her. Todd Palin was one of 13 people the panel voted to subpoena. The state senate panel rejected efforts by two of its Republican members to delay the matter until after the November 4 election. Their report is due next month. The investigation began in the weeks before McCain selected Palin as his running mate . The Republicans say the inquiry is politically motivated.</p> <p>Monegan says that Palin, her aides and her husband, a commercial fisherman and oilfield worker, approached him and complained that trooper Mike Wooten was still employed by the department. Palin fired Monegan in July, and Monegan has publicly said he believes the firing was connected with his refusal to remove Wooten.</p> <p>Sarah Palin's sister Molly married Wooten in 2001 in April 2005 filed for divorce. The Palin family has said Wooten threatened to kill Sarah Palin's father and has lodged more than two dozen official complaints about him with the public safety department. An investigation found that Wooten illegally killed a moose, drank beer in a patrol car and demonstrated a Taser on his 10-year-old stepson. He remains on the force.</p> <p>Earlier, Palin gave voters a further glimpse of her views in a series of three interviews with ABC television that exposed gaps on climate change.<br>\"I'm attributing some of man's activities to potentially causing some of the changes in the climate right now,\" she told ABC's Charlie Gibson.</p> <p>The statement contradicted her past assertions that she did not believe global warming was a result of human activity. She denied expressing such doubts in her ABC interview, but she told the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner last December: \"I'm not an Al Gore, doom-and-gloom environmentalist blaming the changes in our climate on human activity.\" She also told ABC that Washington should not intervene if Israel attacked Iran's nuclear facilities and adopted a more hawkish posture towards Russia than George Bush. </p> <p>At a military ceremony on Thursday, Palin linked the Iraq war to al-Qaida and 9/11. The Washington Post said she told troops deploying to Iraq, including her son, Track, that they would \"defend the innocent from the enemies who planned and carried out and rejoiced in the death of thousands of Americans\".</p>"
