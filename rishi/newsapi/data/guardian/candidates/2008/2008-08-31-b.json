  "<p>You probably noticed Hillary's <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/politics/2008/08/hillary_clinton_on_sarah_palin.html \">initial statement</a> about the Palin selection: </p> <blockquote> <p>We should all be proud of Governor Sarah Palin's historic nomination, and I congratulate her and Senator McCain. While their policies would take America in the wrong direction, Governor Palin will add an important new voice to the debate.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hmmm\u2026.that's not very critical, is it? What could be going on here?</p> <p>Once again, Hillary has leverage and can hold Obama over a barrel for a while here. Basically, there are three categories of people who voted for Clinton in the primaries. First, those who affirmatively adored her (mostly women but many men also). Second, those who wanted a woman president and may have had mixed feelings about her. Third, those who wanted to vote against \"the black.\" </p> <p>The third category will vote McCain and over them she has no sway. But she has sway over groups one and two, and she has the power to depress significantly whatever votes Palin's presence on the ticket may be able to deliver to the GOP. She has clearly decided that she's not ready to do that yet. She will be at some point, but you can bet she's going to make Obama wait, and make him ask her. </p>",
  "<p>Some others have written this by now, but I need to put my two cents on the record. The choice of Sarah Palin as his vice presidential nominee says so much about John McCain that it's deeply alarming, and it is evidence that he, not Obama, lacks the judgment, despite his 72 years on the mortal coil and yes despite even his five years in a communist prison cell, to be the president of the United States.</p> <p>That McCain chose an obvious lightweight like Palin, apparently without even doing so much as bothering to send a researcher out to Wasila, Alaska to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/31/mccain-camp-didnt-search_n_122823.html\">look through her hometown newspaper's coverage</a> of her mayoralty, genuinely should give every reasonable, non-anti-abortion-zealot person pause. He is a reckless and irresponsible man. </p> <p>The John McCain who chose Sarah Palin is the same John McCain who <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-mitchell/john-mccains-gambling-pro_b_111203.html \">likes to blow thousands of dollars</a> \u2013 his wife's dollars, I might add \u2013 at the craps table. (His aides reassure reporters that he never plays on the house; well of course \u2013 Cindy McCain is the house!) And it's the same John McCain who <a href=\"http://www.correntewire.com/john_mccain_fighter_ace_destroyed_five_us_planes \">destroyed five fighter jets</a> \u2013 extremely expensive and sophisticated pieces of equipment \u2013 hot-dogging around on the taxpayers' dime.</p> <p>To this risk-taking (with other people's property), devil-may-care attitude, we add his complete compliance to Rove-ism. That is, one still suspects that deep down, McCain would have wanted to choose a Joe Lieberman or Tom Ridge who would help expand his party into the middle, which is what in his saner moments he truly believes it needs to do. But he's clearly thrown that out the window with this pick as well.</p> <p>She'll be tricky for the Democrats to handle for a while, but in the long run, she's not remotely ready for the position she's been thrust into and that'll show through and she'll be a net drag on the ticket. But the Democrats should bash McCain more than they bash her.</p>",
  "<p>ST PAUL \u2014&#xa0;As an <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/hurricane/index.ssf/2008/08/11_million_people_evacuate_sou.html\">authentically very serious crisis</a> threatens New Orleans, John McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, just <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/01/us/politics/01repubsday.html\">announced at a press conference here</a> that most of tomorrow's convention events would be cancelled, replaced by a short afternoon session to take care of the technicalities required to make McCain's nomination official. As a consequence, St Paul has been plunged into a strangely quiet kind of chaos. George Bush isn't coming. Dick Cheney isn't coming. The Louisiana delegation is flying home. The downtown area is far from busy. Even McCain, who headed for New Orleans significantly faster than Hurricane Gustav, might give his acceptance speech from the disaster zone in Louisiana, if it turns out that there is one. One of the more minor effects of all this has been to throw the TV pundits into a state of absolute confusion, for two reasons: first, because nobody really has any idea what this is going to mean, politically speaking, and second, because it feels vaguely tasteless even to be asking the question. One thing, though, is almost certain: over the course of the next few hours, an annoying gaggle of conservative talking heads will begin to declare that questioning McCain's motives is tantamount to personally wishing destruction in New Orleans. </p> <p>While we're waiting for that, <a href=\"http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/08/the_politics_of_putting_aside.php\">here's</a> a useful reminder from Marc Ambinder that all those McCain <a href=\"http://www.time-blog.com/swampland/2008/08/a_nonpolitical_convention.html\">declarations</a> about \"putting aside politics\" are, of course, politics. (The award for Orwellian Comment Most Reminiscent of the Months After 9/11 goes to Republican operative Tom Basile, who <a href=\"http://www.observer.com/2008/politics/basile-convention-no-longer-politics-as-usual\">tells</a> the New York Observer: \"There is a new mission, and a new focus... At a time of a national emergency, it's not politics as usual.\") And you can't help imagining that many Republicans will be heaving sighs of relief to learn that instead of addressing the convention, Bush will be <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/13019.html\">addressing the nation</a> tomorrow night instead. Then there were all those predictions about how the convention would be lacklustre compared to the Democrats': well, it will be, and it was probably going to be anyway. But now there'll be an compelling reason.</p> <p>On the other hand, as <a href=\"http://www.observer.com/2008/politics/gustav-implications-mccain\">Steve Kornacki points out</a>, McCain stands to lose a lot: \"Whatever shell of a convention they will now put on almost certainly won't include any Obama-bashing. To do so would risk a mighty backlash. Plus, any plans of beating Americans over the head with McCain's compelling biography are probably gone now \u2013 again, unless the storm changes course.\" And so we hang around in St Paul, keeping half an eye on the Weather Channel.<br></p>",
  "<p>It's fair to say that Minnesota, which has voted Democrat in every presidential election since 1976, had mixed feelings about its summer guests. Where Denver international airport teemed last week with volunteers to welcome newcomers, the airport serving Minneapolis and St Paul offered balloons and an LED screen. A group formed for the events, The UnConvention, has highlighted the culture clash between the Republicans and St Paul's lefty types with a video series, urging locals to play along. In one, two gay couples, kissing in a park, rearrange into boy-girl pairs when rightwingers pass by. \"The Republicans are coming,\" the ad says. \"Make an effort.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The gift bags provided to delegates and journalists in Denver contained giveaways designed to associate key brands with the Democrats' newfound lustre. The bags provided in St Paul, meanwhile, included a bag of Chex snacks, a Nature Valley cereal bar and a Fiber One health bar - all made by the cereal-processing giant General Mills. The corn lobby knows on which side its bread is buttered. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>However this week unfolds, we can be sure that there will be no crowd to match the 80,000 who watched Barack Obama speak in Denver, and therefore less risk of ABC News host Terry Moran getting too caught up in the moment. It's hard to imagine how anyone could overstate how historic it was for the Democrats to nominate Obama. But Moran managed it, describing the candidate as \"the son of a black man from Kenya and a white man from Kansas.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>John McCain's selection of Sarah Palin as his vice-president has put ex-White House svengali Karl Rove in a fix. When Obama was toying with Virginia governor Tim Kaine as his running-mate, Rove was scornful: Kaine was previously mayor of Richmond, Virginia, \"the 105th largest city in America ... It's not a big town.\" Rove said Palin was mayor of \"the second-largest city in Alaska\", a claim that might be persuasive, if it were true. Anchorage, Juneau and Fairbanks are the top three. And Richmond is about 40 times larger than Palin's Wasilla.</p>",
  "<p>The Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, yesterday defended his choice of running mate, Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, in the face of widespread scorn that she lacks experience, especially in foreign policy.</p> <p>Asked about her lack of experience on Fox News Sunday, McCain said: \"She's been commander in chief of the Alaska National Guard ... she's had judgment on these issues. She's had 12 years of elected office experience, including travelling to Kuwait.\"</p> <p>Republicans accused Palin's critics of being sexist in their readiness to dismiss her. The appointment of the social conservative as vice-presidential nominee, has been enthusiastically greeted by the party's rightwing.</p> <p><br>One of McCain's closest advisers, Senator Lindsey Graham, said she had more experience than McCain's presidential opponent, Barack Obama. \"She's been a governor ... that's more than Obama.\"</p> <p>Palin's appointment came as a surprise to Obama's campaign team, which immediately criticised her lack of experience. But Obama later changed the tone to politely welcome the historic nature of having the first woman on a Republican ticket. His campaign team dispatched staff to Alaska to look into her background, including her initial support for the state's expensive and infamous Ketchikan bridge, known better as the Bridge to Nowhere.</p> <p>Although opinion polls taken over the weekend are being eagerly awaited by both camps, Real Clear Politics, a website that tracks major polls and provides a running average, yesterday had Obama on 47% and McCain on 44%. In the battlefield states, Obama was ahead in Pennsylvania and McCain in Florida, with the two tied in Ohio.</p> <p>In a theme echoed by other Democrats throughout the day, Senator John Kerry, the failed Democratic candidate for the presidency in 2004, described Palin as having been picked to placate the Republican party's rightwing, which is suspicious of McCain. Kerry told ABC News: \"He's chosen somebody who doesn't believe climate change is man-made.\"</p> <p>He said it was insulting to Hillary Clinton supporters to suggest that Palin, given her anti-abortion and other socially conservative views, might woo them.</p> <p>The former Democratic Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, described the appointment as \"inexplicable\".</p> <p>But Rush Limbaugh, whose radio show attracts millions of rightwing listeners, enthusiastically welcomed her. \"Palin equals guns, babies, Jesus ... Obama just lost blue-collar, white Democratic voters in Pennsylvania and other states,\" Limbaugh said. James Dobson, the conservative Christian leader who had been opposed to McCain, said the selection of Palin had won him over. </p> <p>After appearing with McCain at a rally in Dayton, Ohio, on Friday, Palin made her second campaign speech on Saturday near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Her stop in Pittsburgh showed a vulnerability that could be a worry for McCain. Some of the audience left as she was speaking and there was booing when, in an appeal to Democratic voters to switch to McCain, she mentioned Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>As the Republicans wheel out their latest asset, there is still disagreement on how to deploy one of their oldest: the incumbent president. As George Bush ends his second term in office, he has acquired the distinction among the general American population of being one of the most disliked presidents in history, alongside Harry Truman and Richard Nixon, with his popularity rating at about 28%.</p> <p>Although polls show that two out of three Republican loyalists still continue to think highly of Bush, the loathing with which he is now regarded by huge swaths of the country has a direct bearing on the re-election hopes of scores of Republican members of Congress in swing states. Unless Bush is kept in the shadows their jobs could be on the line in November.</p> <p>While part of the alliance of interests in the so-called Reagan coalition continue to adore the president, others are disillusioned by him. Top of the list of the disgruntled are the economic conservatives, for whom tight public spending, tax cuts and balanced budgets are key.</p> <p>Equally livid is the libertarian wing that has been an influential part of the movement since the 1960s. It defines conservatism as vesting power in the individual, free of government interference, but blames Bush for having extended the reach of Washington more than any other president since Lyndon Johnson. On the other side of the widening rift within US conservatism, the Christian right remains broadly supportive of the president.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday September 1 2008. We incorrectly gave the name of Senator Lindsey Graham as Senator Graham Lindsey. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>'Some nations have a gift for ceremonial,\" wrote the future third Marquess of Salisbury, Lord Robert Cecil, after watching Queen Victoria open parliament. \"No poverty of means or absence of splendour inhibits them from making any pageant in which they take part both real and impressive. Everybody falls naturally into his proper place, throws himself without effort into the spirit of the little drama he is enacting and instinctively represses all appearance of constraint or distracted attention.\"</p> <p>What was arguably true for 19th century Britain (Cecil, as it happens, believed that Britain did not possess that gift) is no less so for 21st century America. As one party convention ends and another begins (hurricane permitting), we are halfway through a fortnight of ticker tape, talking points, balloons and bluster. </p> <p>There was a time when these conventions meant something more than mere pageantry. They were the place where arguments were made, platforms thrashed out and delegates wooed with policy. But like British party conferences, conventions are now essentially media events at which the media enjoys neither particular access, information nor, for the most part, insight. The result is two weeks of propaganda rolled out like a well-choreographed marketing campaign and faithfully transmitted by supine outlets.</p> <p>Like most acts of ceremony, form has long surpassed content. The further they have strayed from the substance the more the symbols matter. Strip away the high-minded commentary and you are left with two patriotic parades steeped in electoral rivalry and masquerading as a celebration of democratic culture. </p> <p>As far as pageantry goes, they could certainly be worse. At least in these there are no gilded coaches, crowns, ermine or wigs. And yet despite the slew of historic candidacies - first Barack Obama and now Sarah Palin - it seems as though this year America's political class has less to celebrate than ever. </p> <p>For the conventions do not just mark the beginning of a new presidential cycle but the passing of an old one. The fact that this administration has been criminally incompetent is now the stuff of water-cooler orthodoxy. The fact that it has been plain criminal is not. But it should be. Under George Bush the US has tortured, disenfranchised, lied, spied and, on more than one occasion, flouted its own constitution. Those who would not go along were fired or demoted. Those rulings it could not garner support for it simply classified or hid. Those inquiries it could not prevent it thwarted. When Major General Antonio Taguba tried to pursue his investigation of Abu Ghraib up the chain of command he was stopped. \"I was legally prevented from further investigation into higher authority,\" he told the New Yorker. </p> <p>Its violation of international law is ultimately a matter for the international community. But its violation of American laws is a matter for the American public. However, it is now clear that the political consequences of these transgressions will range from negligible to non-existent. The Bush administration should be led away in handcuffs - either indicted or impeached. Instead it is about to leave the scene of the crime in broad daylight while those tasked to police this democracy - notably politicians and the press - blind themselves with confetti. </p> <p>Those who regard impeachment as merely a vindictive attempt to adjudicate the past display a chronic lack of imagination. True, it is not going to happen. But that makes it no less morally compelling or politically relevant to argue that it should. Trying to look ahead without acknowledging how you got to where you are is a surefire way to end up wandering around in circles. And the last place the Democrats want to be is where they were.</p> <p>Take voter registration. Around this time last year the attorney general, Alberto Gonzales, was forced to resign amid allegations of perjury before Congress over his role in the politically motivated firing of seven attorneys. They were replaced by what his then chief of staff referred to as \"loyal Bushies\" on the advice of the White House. Five of the fired attorneys were in battleground states. They had irritated local Republicans by refusing to bring voter fraud cases targeted at loyal Democratic groups because of lack of evidence. </p> <p>The congressional hearings were a farce. Gonzales said he \"could not recall\" more than 71 times in one day. Clearly he hoped we would forget too. </p> <p>But in a year when voter rolls are swelling with the expectation of an unprecedented turnout it is crucial that we remember. A few weeks ago John McCain's campaign attorneys attended a national training session for Republican lawyers on election law, which included a session on identifying and responding to instances of voter fraud. Despite the justice department's own studies showing that voter fraud is extremely rare, Republicans are gearing up for mass intimidation in minority areas on election day. If the election is close expect to see Florida 2000 replayed from Virginia to Nevada. And if the challenges go to court, Gonzales's \"loyal Bushies\" will be there to hear the cases.</p> <p>Such are the lasting consequences of Bush's crooked tenure. Casting him as inept and unethical is not difficult. He is the most unpopular president for six decades. Some have been loathed more - but none by so many for so long. But understanding how he managed to do it demands a wider lens. </p> <p>For he could not do it alone. The US is not an elected dictatorship. The president is supposed to stand at the helm of a system of checks and balances. The reason there was no balance was because there were no checks. The real problem with the Bush years is not so much that he did what he did, but that he managed to gain the consent of America's political class in enabling him to do it. His political estrangement is not because he tried, only because he failed. </p> <p>This has more or less been conceded by none other than the leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, who voted against the war in Iraq. When asked recently by the Nation why she took impeachment off the table before the 2006 elections, Pelosi answered: \"What about these other people who voted for that war with no evidence ... Are they going to be voting with us to impeach the president? Where are these Democrats going to be? Are they going to be voting for us to impeach a president who took us to war on information that they had also?\" In other words, for the Democrats to impeach the president they would first have to implicate themselves.</p> <p>This is not to say the Democrats were equally culpable. But they were differently responsible, and cowed by accusations of lack of patriotism most of them abdicated that responsibility.</p> <p>Asked to explain the administration's use of torture, the director of the 9/11 commission, Philip Zelikow, said: \"Fear and anxiety exploited by zealots and fools.\" But there is, it seems, no price to pay for being a zealot or a fool in power. America will no doubt be anxious and fearful again some day. And for all the ceremonial hyperbole of this convention season, there is little to suggest that when that day comes the fools and zealots won't once again come out on top.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>As America's Republicans assemble for their convention in St Paul, Minnesota, today, New Orleans is being evacuated ahead of Hurricane Gustav. This backdrop could not be more damaging - it stirs memories of the same city's punishment by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Washington's bungled response then is what convinced mainstream America that the anti-government Republican philosophy was bankrupt. Ever since, the party has drifted towards its predicament now - in office, but no longer in power.</p> <p>The party is refining its plans to limit the damage. Under the original schedule, George Bush - remember him? - would have taken to the convention stage one last time tonight. He remains president for another five months. Yet since 2006 he has become as lame a lame-duck leader as America has known in decades. At the congressional level the Republicans have been eclipsed by the Democrats for the past 18 months and are set to fall further behind in November. The party's one plausible chance of success is the presidency. And it chose as its candidate the man best placed to make its hope of winning it again as plausible as possible, thanks to his record of appealing to moderate voters. </p> <p>There was a time when John McCain could also claim to be a breath of fresh air, in the face of the relentlessly rightwing agenda of Republicans such as Newt Gingrich, Dick Cheney and, of course, Mr Bush himself. As a presidential candidate in 2000 Mr McCain took on the forces of the right, notably in a brave speech in Virginia Beach which attacked Christian conservatives and effectively sank his candidacy. Those days have gone. Mr McCain may still be travelling in his Straight Talk Express, but his policies have been twisted. He has bowed the knee to the conservatives on gay rights, abortion, climate change and campaign finance. His selection of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate embodies all these concessions: she is an anti-abortion, anti-gay, pro-oil-company evangelical Christian straight out of central casting. When Republican policies on everything from the economy to Iraq have had a dire effect on the party's standing, Mr McCain should have chosen a running mate who signalled that things would be different now. </p> <p>Instead he has chosen a number two whose message is that, though she is a woman, things will not change much at all. Since Mr McCain is 72, the inexperienced and rightwing Mrs Palin might be closer than the proverbial heartbeat from the presidency, putting off moderate voters who might otherwise have been tempted to vote for Mr McCain. The Republicans had better come up with a dynamically outward-looking convention. If they do not, a win in November seems neither likely nor deserved.</p>",
  "<p>The fact that \"a girl from the south side of Chicago and the son of a single mother from Hawaii\" could make it this far represents everything that is good and hopeful about the US, says Timothy Garton Ash (Comment, August 28).</p> <p>True, but the US, for all its celebration of free markets and self-reliance, has one of the lowest rates of intergenerational social mobility and one of the highest degrees of income and wealth inequality of all the rich OECD countries.</p> <p>Canada, Germany and the Nordics all have substantially lower inequality and higher social mobility. This is yet another source of the US economy's growing weakness, which the next president should confront - but may not, partly because of the blinding power of the \"land of opportunity\" story.<br><strong>Professor Robert H Wade</strong><br>Development Studies Institute, London School of Economics</p> <p>Jonathan Freedland (Comment, August 27) noted that \"Obama would indeed have the shortest r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of any president in a century\". Woodrow Wilson (1913-21) would also be a contender for that distinction.</p> <p>In the New York Review of Books, January 16 1992, Garry Wills notes that in the summer of 1908 Wilson \"was staying at a country place in Scotland; but broke off his vacation to visit Edinburgh, where he hung around the telegraph office and newsstands, just in case the Democratic convention, meeting in Denver, should nominate him for the presidency. The absurdity of this expectation can be tested if we remember that he had never at that point, held or even run for public office - never, in fact, attended a Democratic convention.\"</p> <p>In 1910 Wilson, improbably drafted by New Jersey bosses, was elected governor of the state. In 1912 he was nominated for president by a whisker - on the 46th ballot. Like Obama, Wilson was a prolific writer with a flair for inspirational oratory. But his record of political public service, on the eve of the first world war, was much thinner than Obama's. <br><strong>Don Munro</strong><br>Exeter, Devon</p> <p>Sarah Palin's favourite meal (McCain moves to steal Obama's thunder by choosing woman running mate, August 30) changed from \"moose stew\" in the first column to \"mooseburger\" in the fifth column.

No one in their right mind would try to make a burger out of a stew.<br><strong>Charles Jennings</strong><br>Winchester, Hampshire</p> <p>My heart leapt when I read the line \"McCain picks Palin as running mate\" on your website (August 30).

  "<p>Hurricane Gustav has thrown America's political agenda into chaos with the biggest casualty being the Republican party convention, which was due to open today in Minneapolis-St Paul, Minnesota.</p> <p>John McCain and his strategists announced yesterday they were cancelling almost all of today's programme. It is the first time in living memory that a Republican or Democratic convention has been disrupted by a natural disaster.</p> <p>McCain, in an interview broadcast yesterday, said it would be inappropriate to have a \"festive occasion\" against the backdrop of a potential disaster.</p> <p>The Republicans are especially sensitive because of George Bush's slow response to Hurricane Katrina that devastated New Orleans almost three years ago.</p> <p>Bush, who had been due to speak at the convention in Minneapolis-St Paul tonight, would not be attending in order to focus on disaster relief. \"It just wouldn't be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster,\" McCain said in an interview recorded on Saturday with Fox News Sunday.</p> <p>If Gustav creates widespread devastation in the Gulf states, the Republicans will have to consider scaling back on the remaining three days of the convention. All the speeches could be ditched. But, for legal reasons, the convention has to find time to formally adopt McCain as the party nominee for the November 4 election.</p> <p>The disruption may work in McCain's favour. He is not a good speaker and could be struggling to match Barack Obama's speech in front of 80,000 supporters in Denver on Thursday. Gustav offers him a get-out: he could accept the nomination by video or some other alternative to a speech from a podium.</p> <p>A truncated convention helps him in other ways too. His convention was always threatening to be more fractious than the Democrats, with many Republicans prepared to voice unhappiness with McCain for not being conservative enough.</p> <p>Crucially, Hurricane Gustav offers the Republicans a chance to make amends for Bush's failure three years ago. Charlie Crist, the Republican governor of Florida, told CNN that the level of preparation had been tremendous, showing lessons had been learned from Katrina. The speedy evacuation ordered yesterday contrasted with the lack of urgency in 2005.</p> <p>It was Bush's slow response to Hurricane Katrina rather than the Iraq war that led to the public change in attitude to him and the resultant steady drop in polling ratings. Bush at the time stuck to a schedule that took him from his ranch in Texas and to California, happily strumming a guitar at one event, and only went to the New Orleans region five days later.</p> <p>McCain's Democratic rival, Barack Obama, is almost certain to modify his campaign plans for the week, because, like McCain, partisan speeches would be regarded as insensitive.</p> <p>Obama, who won one of the biggest cheers of the night on Thursday when he told supporters that Bush had allowed a major US city, New Orleans, to drown, was more restrained yesterday: \"Hopefully, we've learned from (Hurricane Katrina's) tragedy,\" he said. He has to balance a willingness to help without being seen as opportunistic. He offered to call on his huge supporter base, built up over 20 months of campaigning, to provide funds for disaster relief and to act as volunteers who would go to the Gulf.</p>",
  "<p>Representatives of Silvio Berlusconi's government will today meet trade union leaders in a bid to secure their backing for the take-off of a new Italian flag-carrier airline, salvaged from the wreckage of Alitalia. The government's plan envisages a much smaller company and up to 5,000 job losses.</p> <p>On Friday, Corrado Passera, the chief executive of the stricken airline's sale adviser, Intesa Sanpaola, said a deal with its traditionally militant unions was crucial to the re-launch plan, which is sponsored by Berlusconi's government. The prime minister made defence of Alitalia's \"Italian-ness\" a central plank of his successful campaign for election in April.</p> <p>The effect of his undertaking was to harden union resistance to an earlier scheme promoted by the previous, centre-left government. The unions' stance drove away the key player in that operation, Air France-KLM.</p> <p>Last week, after details of the new plan were officially released, Berlusconi declared victory. \"We have won the bet\", he said. \"The only alternative was [corporate] failure.\"</p> <p>But financiers and industrialists central to the strategy, known as Project Phoenix, were more cautious. Passera said: \"The next four to five weeks will be crucial to understanding if we can go ahead or not.\" Roberto Colaninno, president of the Piaggio scooter company, who is expected to chair the revamped Alitalia, added that finding a foreign partner was \"indispensable\".</p> <p>He told the daily La Repubblica that negotiations were being held with Air France-KLM and Lufthansa, and that they were \"going at the same speed\".</p> <p>Project Phoenix is likely to face scrutiny on competition grounds from the European commission. And it could also prompt legal action from the Italian airline's international rivals, many of whom will see it as an exercise in state aid.</p> <p>Walter Veltroni, the unofficial leader of the centre-left opposition, damned the scheme as a \"messy, confused, dangerous solution that does not, in fact, meet the interests of the country\". He said Italy would be left not with a flag carrier but a \"bunting carrier\".</p> <p>The proposed airline - made up of the profitable rump of Alitalia and its main domestic rival, AirOne - would have 36% fewer aircraft, 40% fewer employees and 28% fewer destinations, most of them concentrated in Italy and the rest of Europe. Crucially, however, it would have a government-enforced monopoly of the most profitable route in Italy, the one linking Milan's Linate airport with Fiumicino outside Rome.</p> <p>Colaninno heads a consortium of 16 investors, all Italian, who have expressed a readiness to sink \u20ac1bn (\u00a3806m) into the new airline. The \u20ac1.2bn debts of the \"bad company\" would be dumped on the taxpayer, along with the even greater costs of winding it up.</p> <p>The government has promised that share- and bond-holders will, if necessary, be compensated out of a fund created to reimburse the victims of financial swindles. The redundant workers are to be offered up to seven years of welfare support. </p> <p>Colannino called Project Phoenix a \"market operation\". He indignantly rejected opposition claims that members of the consortium had been arm-twisted into saving the prime minister's face.</p> <p>However the shadow finance minister, Pierluigi Bersani, said some had gone in \"with a pistol to the temple\". Passera called the remark \"unfortunate\".</p>",
  "<p>One of the main factors that is supposedly keeping McCain level with Obama in the polls is the Republican's foreign policy acumen and experience. On Iraq, there is certainly clear water between the candidates' rhetoric. The division is between the man who recognises reality and the man who is lost in an illusion of his own. McCain falls into the latter category, peddling the standard line that \"Iraq must not become a failed state, a haven for terrorists, or a pawn of Iran\". Yet the US invasion of Iraq has created exactly these three scenarios, and just because John McCain says \"must\" is no reason to envisage any change. </p> <p>Ben Dear, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/08/johnmccain.usforeignpolicy\">writing</a> on Cif, was correct to point out McCain's deluded obsession with Iraq. He has been out to the country eight times since the war began and is now positioning himself to share the reflected glory of the perceived '<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/01/iraq.usa\">success</a>' of the surge. McCain criticises Obama for not having spent enough time in Iraq, while simultaneously endorsing the Bush doctrine of leaving commanders on the ground to run the show. Yet simply having been to Iraq is no proof of knowledge or expertise on the situation there. Secretive surprise trips to Baghdad and heavily protected visits to markets smack of stage-showed bravado rather than diplomatic finesse, as many have <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2007/04/09/mccain_iraq/\">observed</a>. </p> <p>McCain's lack of realistic diplomacy is also evident in terms of regional Middle Eastern policy. He <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/fdeb03a7-30b0-4ece-8e34-4c7ea83f11d8.htm\">says</a> that \"the answer is not unconditional dialogues with these two dictatorships (Iran and Syria) from a position of weakness. The answer is for the international community to apply real pressure to Syria and Iran to change their behaviour\". Yet this policy is identical to that of George Bush and that has failed over the past eight years, in fact emboldening both Damascus and Tehran. </p> <p>Indeed, the former Nato commander Wesley Clark <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/11/gen-clark-mccain-is-untes_n_106457.html\">outlined</a> how \"John McCain has pretty much bought the central thrust of the Bush administration's foreign policies: relying on threat and bluster [and] isolating people we don't agree with instead of engaging them.\" McCain calls Obama naive in his promises to \"launch an aggressive diplomatic effort to reach a comprehensive compact on the stability of Iraq and the region. This effort will include all of Iraq's neighbours \u2013 including Iran and Syria\". Yet surely the truly naive politician is the one who cannot recognise policy failings and incorrectly claims credit for successes (the success of the surge being down to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/12/badplanning\">far more</a> than simply troop numbers.</p> <p>Reports that the Iraqi government is <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/aug/27/baghdad-plans-to-build-giant-ferris-wheel/\">planning</a> to build its own version of the London Eye provide an apt metaphor for the situation in the country \u2013 that what goes up can quickly come down, and we should avoid getting carried away with the view from the top. Will McCain do as Bush before him and disavow responsibility for any increases in violence in Iraq? America, and certainly the Middle East, does not need another conviction politician who refuses to see things as they really are. </p> <p>In Afghanistan, Obama promises to follow Bush, as Brown followed Blair, by changing tact with \"more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights\". McCain's 'informed' logic is that the supposed victory in Iraq will allow for a shift in focus to Afghanistan where the same 'surge' strategy will succeed. Lumping Afghanistan and Iraq together under the same policy umbrella is another staple of Bush's 'war on terror' and McCain will probably experience its pitfalls. </p> <p>If McCain's recent success against Obama has come from his targeting his opponent's strengths, then Obama should focus on McCain's 'supposed' foreign policy strength and reveal it to be the hardline continuation of present policies that it really is. Obama's Denver speech hinted at more to come when he said that \"if John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need\". The world waits as the battle between continuity and change goes on.</p>",
  "<p>Residents were today fleeing New Orleans following a mandatory evacuation order as the city braces for its worst hurricane since Katrina struck with devastating force three years ago.</p> <p>Hurricane Gustav has already killed more than 80 people in the Caribbean and fears of a repeat of the devastation caused by Katrina, when the US government was shamed by images of people stranded without relief, prompted the mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, to issue the order to evacuate. </p> <p>Today he said that Gustav was expected to hit New Orleans as a 150mph category 4 storm at daybreak tomorrow, earlier than previously anticipated. </p> <p>\"This is still a big ugly storm and I strongly urge everyone to leave,\" he said.</p> <p>He added that all of his staff bar a few key workers were also being evacuated.</p> <p>In an attempt to avoid the looting that came in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina, Nagin announced that a dusk-to-dawn curfew would begin at sunset tonight and would continue until the storm threat had passed.</p> <p>\"I want to make sure every looter knows they will go directly to Angola prison,\" he said.</p> <p>Last night, he called Gustav the \"storm of the century\" and told the city's estimated 340,000 residents to \"get your butts moving and out of New Orleans right now\".</p> <p>Some have suggested that Nagin might be overplaying the threat - it is not certain that New Orleans will take a direct hit - after the political fallout from the failure to evacuate New Orleans ahead of Katrina.</p> <p>Katrina was a category three when its 28ft storm surge burst the levees protecting New Orleans on August 29 2005, flooding 80% of the city. The hurricane left around 1,500 people dead on the Gulf coast and an $80bn (\u00a340bn) bill to repair the damage made it the costliest natural disaster in US history.</p> <p>Federal officials say the levees protecting New Orleans are stronger now but still have gaps that make vulnerable some of the neighbourhoods hardest hit by Katrina's floods.</p> <p>Gustav's centre was about 485 miles south-east of the Mississippi river's mouth at 2am, with top winds of near 135mph expected to strengthen as it crosses the central Gulf.</p> <p>Evacuations have also been underway in Mississippi and East Texas.</p> <p>Yesterday, the storm hit Cuba's tobacco-growing western tip, where no deaths were reported, before moving away from the island country into the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>The Cuban weather service said one of its stations measured a wind gust of 204mph and officials said the storm knocked over trees, damaged buildings, and demolished banana plantations.</p> <p>Hurricane deaths are rare in Cuba, where evacuations are well organised and begin early.</p> <p>The storm is the first test of New Orleans' revamped evacuation plan designed to eliminate the chaos, looting and death that followed Katrina.</p> <p>But a plan to electronically log and track evacuees with a barcode system has already failed and been aborted to keep the buses moving. Officials said information on evacuees would be taken when they reached their destinations.</p> <p>The city will not offer emergency services to those who choose to stay behind, Nagin said, and there will be no \"last resort\" shelter as there was during Katrina, when thousands were crammed into the Louisiana Superdome in squalid conditions.</p> <p>In a news release residents were warned that those who remained on their property after the mandatory evacuation started would be subject to arrest. Some 2,000 National Guard troops were expected in the city.</p> <p>An estimated 1 million people had already fled the Gulf Coast before the warning was issued. They clogged roadways, emptied gas stations of fuel and jammed phone circuits.</p> <p>At the city's main transit terminal, a line snaked through the parking lot for more than a mile as residents with no other means of getting out waited to board buses bound for shelters in north Louisiana and beyond.</p> <p>Homeland security secretary, Michael Chertoff, plans to travel to Louisiana today to observe preparations. And the Republican candidate for president, John McCain, and his running mate, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, were travelling to Mississippi.</p>",
