  "<p>Go on, you can say it - recession. It doesn't sound anywhere near as bad as \"global financial meltdown\" or \"depression\" or \"the end of days\", does it? And now, after months of worry, we have something that all the wealth in the world couldn't buy: a sense of closure. From here on in all we need to do is adjust our outlook - a little less Gomorrah, a little more High School Musical 3.</p> <p>Still, there are tough times ahead, times when even the wealthiest among us will feel the pinch. But there is good news for any former millionaires now finding it difficult to walk the walk. In the wake of the pronounced economic slowdown - sorry, \"recession\" - many companies are now offering the trappings of super-wealth for hire. Priceless watches can be rented for the weekend, designer handbags by the month, luxury yachts by the day and labradors by the hour. You can hire a short-term butler or, if you're really pressed for cash, you can work as one. Either way it's encouraging to see that services that were once the preserve of fraudsters are now available to formerly wealthy people desperate to keep up appearances. But there are yet niches to fill: posh independent school uniform hire, DIY Damien Hirst installation kits, signed thank-you notes from Peter Mandelson. Get going, downturn opportunists! The <br>nouveaux pauvres need you.</p> <p><strong>Recession-busting tip: </strong>Libraries were once forbidding, silent places filled with people trying to read, but these days they have hardly any books in them, and talking is positively encouraged. Head down to your \"local\" and see for yourself. It's a great place to unwind, make loads of phone calls or meet up with mates for a nice loud chat - like a cinema, but free!</p> <p><strong>What's going cheap right now: </strong>Brown onions, John McCain Halloween masks, supermarket alcohol, the pound.</p>",
  "<p>Back in the days of no-holds-barred advertising by Madison Avenue's finest, anything went. Drinking alcohol made you sexy, smoking cigarettes was good for your lungs and every washing powder contained a magic ingredient that made your whites super-white.</p> <p>And guess what? Those days are back, at least for green <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/advertising\">advertising</a>. As more and more customers demand environmental responsibility from companies, few large corporations with any sort of public profile now dare to enter the marketplace without a blizzard of sustainability audits and low-carbon-emissions targets. But that being so, the risk of being conned by slick corporate \"greenwash\" has never been greater, as the volume of complaints to the <a href=\"http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/\">Advertising Standards Authority</a> (ASA) testifies.</p> <p>The green claims coming from corporations can be absurdly general. Nearly everything we buy these days seems to be \"sustainably sourced\" or \"environmentally friendly\". Sometimes, though, they are crazily specific. Virgin Trains declares: \"Our Pendolino trains emit 76% less CO2 than cars or domestic flights.\" But which cars, which flights, and how full are the trains? </p> <p>Or plain bonkers. One brand of bottled water says its product contains \"300% more oxygen\". </p> <p>In August, the ad industry's watchdog, the ASA, rapped oil company Shell's knuckles for trying to claim, in an advertisement in the Financial Times, that its $10bn investment in sucking tar sands out of the Canadian midwest was a contribution to a sustainable energy future. Tar sands contain bitumen. It takes a great deal of energy to turn them into something you can put in a fuel tank. Overall, the emissions from mining, refining and burning tar sands are between three and 10 times greater than for conventional oil. Shell's sleight of hand was to use the much-abused word \"sustainability\" to imply a green agenda when what it was really on about was keeping a sustainable flow of fuel out of its forecourt pumps. The ASA cried foul.</p> <p>Earlier in the year, the agency also upheld complaints against Renault for branding its Twingo an \"eco\" car and picturing it with leaves blowing out of its tailpipe, even though its emissions are among the worst for a car of its size. </p> <p>Advertising, says the ASA, \"should always avoid the vague use of terms such as sustainable, green, non-polluting and so on\". </p> <p>In the real world, we have to admit, things can be nuanced. Lots of corporate claims - about carbon neutrality, for instance - hang on exactly what activities are being audited. Take Manchester airport, which was outed in a recent report from the sustainable development organisation, Forum for the Future. Last year the airport's owners pledged to make the airport carbon-neutral, with one small caveat: the target does not include the 200,000-plus flights into and out of the airport each year. As Forum for the Future observed, \"this jars somewhat\".</p> <p>And what are we to make of Fiji Water's claims to be cutting the carbon footprint of its water by 25% and offsetting the rest? \"Every drop is green,\" it says. But isn't the whole idea of bottling water on a remote South Pacific island and shipping it to your dinner table just a tiny bit barmy? </p> <p>Equally questionable are the claims of financial institutions. Back in the days (oh, only a few weeks ago) when the City of London was concerned with something other than day-to-day corporate survival, the City of London Corporation launched a City Climate Pledge, under which finance houses would pledge to \"measure and monitor\" their carbon footprint. Good for them. Perhaps a few will follow the lead of HSBC, which has developed close links with the environment group WWF and has claimed since 2005 to be the world's first carbon-neutral bank. </p> <p>But the pledge looks suspiciously like greenwash. Companies simply have to fill out a form detailing their CO2 plans and they can use the pledge logo. \"Companies using the logo will be recognised as exemplar sustainable businesses [able to] attract consumers who are becoming more discerning about the credentials of businesses they deal with,\" says the flyer. Not bad for just filling out a form. Especially as there doesn't seem to be any follow-up or auditing process involved.</p> <p>But as with the efforts of Manchester airport and Fiji Water, there remains a rather large elephant in the living room. The carbon footprint of finance houses is not about whether they offset executive flights or put double glazing in the boardroom; it is about their investment decisions. The press release put out by the City of London said the pledge would \"encourage City organisations to use their global influence to affect the behaviour of companies around the UK and the world\". Could the City be about to impose a freeze on cash for tar sands or coal-fired power stations? Not so fast. The pledge itself makes no mention of this. </p> <p>I would have expected City institutions to be falling over themselves to sign up to the pledge. But 11 months after companies were first asked to sign the pledge, and three months after its public launch, the pledge's website is still promising that a list of signatories \"will be available shortly\", and further inquiries revealed that just one company - Deutsche Bank - had so far completed registration. Right now the pledge looks like a one-day PR wonder to green the City's image, with no substance at all. Or maybe they are all just a little busy right now. </p> <p>To try to keep up with the welter of environmental claims, test the green spin and spot the green frauds, the Guardian is launching today a regular online column, Greenwash, and calls on readers to submit their examples of the fraudulent, mendacious, confusing, ignorant or just daft claims jostling for our attention.</p> <p>Along the way, we may get to the heart of a dilemma that faces us all. Can we shop our way to sustainability? Are some products so green it is better to buy two of them rather than one? Or are our own consumer lifestyles, suffused in greenwash, the problem? Is there really no alternative to putting away our credit cards, pulling on our thickest jumper and heading for the hills?</p> <p>We won't be limiting our investigations to corporations - we'll have politicians in our sights, too. Scraping away at the green patina on the new-look, Zac Goldsmith-inspired Conservative environmental policies, puncturing Brown's grumpy greenery and unpicking the carbon contortions of the coal-loving Celts. And now that both Barack Obama and John McCain claim environmental credentials, we'll be looking for greenwash at the White House too.</p> <p>And we won't forget that, even in the corporate world, greenwash is not just a defensive mantra to help maintain business as usual. Some people are out there pushing the environmental agenda with sinister intent. Take, for example, the green rebranding of Steptoe and Son.</p> <p>Last year the EU introduced the charmingly named WEEE directive, which stands for Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment. The aim is to prevent millions of tonnes of toxic TVs, personal computers, toasters and other electronic goods being dumped into landfill each year. Instead, they have to be recycled. You may not have noticed this because there are no laws stopping you putting that laptop into your dustbin. But corporations and retailers are charged with making sure most of our electronic waste gets recycled. The question is how.</p> <p>Some of this stuff is making its way to a handful of hi-tech metals recycling plants in Europe. But most is going to the developing world. Often it has paperwork claiming it will be refurbished and re-used, but nobody has the resources to police the system, so in practice much of it ends up in primitive workshops in India and west Africa and China, where it is stripped out, boiled up, dunked in acid or smashed to smithereens by unskilled, low-paid and frequently child labour. I have seen this \"recycling\" industry at work in Delhi, where barefooted children as young as eight dunk circuit boards in barrels of acid to remove traces of copper. </p> <p>Last month, a charity called Computer Aid tried to blow the whistle on this. Computer Aid is one of the few organisations that is genuinely and safely refurbishing and reusing old computers, many of them going to schools in Kenya. It fears this \"good\" and socially responsible recycling will be undermined by the bad guys. Why is this happening? Partly because factories in India badly want the metals in your old computer. And partly because too many European companies have a no-questions-asked policy towards every broker and cowboy willing to take troublesome waste off their hands. As one industrial supplier told me last year, \"A lot of these guys don't even have addresses, just mobile phone numbers.\"</p> <p>Recycling may be a new term, but the trade is not new. Until the 60s, recyclers plied the streets of Britain with a horse and cart collecting old stuff that could be sold on. The characters in the television show Steptoe and Son were the archetypes. They have been succeeded by a generation of car-crushers and cable-burners. Nobody called it green then: now they do. But the same wide boys are in charge, so if anybody has their mobile numbers, do please get in touch.</p> <p>We are too ready to suspend our critical faculties with anybody claiming to be green. But a great deal of recycling is not quite what it seems. What happens to recycled glass bottles, for instance? As we post them in the recycling bin, we presume they go to make new bottles and cut out the energy cost of making new glass from sand. My local supermarket bin in south London proudly proclaims that recycling one glass bottle \"saves enough energy to power a TV for 20 minutes\".</p> <p>Well, it would if they turned the glass back into new bottles. But it turns out that often they don't. Much of London's recycled glass is actually crushed and sold to construction firms as a substitute for sand, or an ingredient in a substitute for asphalt such as Glasphalt - \"specially treated so it won't puncture tyres,\" as one recycling website puts it. That's a relief, but how many assiduous recyclers trying to do their bit for the environment realise they are actually helping build new roads?</p> <p>How many more green scams, cons and generous slices of wishful thinking are out there? We want to name and shame them before the whole green movement gets a bad reputation. \"Green\" has another meaning after all - naive. And we cannot afford that.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/23/energy\">Greenwash: Fred Pearce on the con of green electricity</a></p> <h2>How to spot a fake</h2> <p>It's greenwash if it's ...</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Ludicrously general</strong><br>All claims for products being environmentally friendly or pollution-free should have evidence that clearly supports them. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Overspecific</strong><br>Be on guard against numbers or other \"facts\" that can only be true in specific circumstances, such as Virgin Trains' claims to have 76% fewer emissions than planes or cars <strong>(see main feature)</strong>. Often these come with a discreet asterisk referencing an obscure study - look the study up, or ask the Guardian's new Greenwash column to do so on your behalf. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Reliant on nature pictures</strong><br>Most pernicious, perhaps, are attempts to green products by association, such as cars driving through verdant meadows. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Backed up by a tame boffin</strong><br>Companies like to spotlight their researchers working on renewable energy, even if it makes up less than 1% of their business. Anybody can keep a tame boffin: to mean something, such research must be a significiant part of the company's business. (Incidentally, has anyone met a researcher? We would like to hear.)</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Simply absurd</strong><br>If a claim sounds absurd, it probably is. Inside knowledge can help you blow the whistle, but a nose for the absurd is just as good. </p> <h2>How to spot the real thing</h2> <p>It might just be true if ...</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>What the company says matches what they do</strong><br>Rob Harrison of Ethical Consumer thinks the most important question is: \"Is their position consistent right across the group?\" Some car manufacturers advertise their green cars but continue to lobby for lower carbon-reduction targets. Look for companies who match what they say and do, such as Peugeot, one of the only car manufacturers likely to come in under the European emissions targets in 2010. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The company is in partnership with an independent ethical organisation</strong><br>Forming a partnership with an independent organisation is voluntary and doesn't have to mean much: groups such as the Ethical Trade Initiative or the Carbon Disclosure Project have little power. All the same, it's an indicator of willingness. Some NGOs are more picky: their validation is, therefore, worth more. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>They take that extra, obsessive step</strong><br>Evangelistically green companies such as Lush, Co-operative Food or Sawdays can never resist the chance to talk about the environment, and they've all taken radical steps within their own organisations. Lush uses minimal amounts of packaging and gives money to anti-road groups, Co-operative Food has clad its entire HQ in solar panels, and Sawdays publishers operates from zero-carbon offices. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>They are green innovators</strong><br>DIY Kyoto came up with the Wattson, a device for measuring how much electricity your house is using. BSkyB, headed by James Murdoch, has brought in the auto-standby device, which senses if the box hasn't been used in the two hours after 11pm, and automatically goes to standby.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>They set themselves targets</strong><br>Quantifiable targets set for some specific time in the future - \"we will reduce our water use by such and such by 2010\" - are an indicator of seriousness: they are handing you and the press a stick to beat them with if they miss the target. In January, Tesco, for example, pledged to reduce its carbon footprint by 50% by 2020. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>They take action even if it may harm business</strong><br>Marks &amp; Spencer's decision to charge for plastic bags, British Gas's encouragement of reduced use: these are not immediately obvious comfort zones for money-making enterprises. You can be cynical, or you can clap. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>They have been audited</strong><br>Some companies get a third party in to check they're doing it right: Eurostar called in Environmental Resources Management (ERM) to go over their plans with a toothcomb before they kicked off their big Tread Lightly initiative. Some companies - the Guardian, for example - are so obsessive they will even audit their social report. This could be seen as just showing off. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>They make it easy for you to find all this out </strong><br>If you can't easily find the information, be suspicious and ring up the company.

  "<p>Gordon Brown bowed to the inevitable and admitted yesterday that Britain was about to go into recession for the first time in 16 years. He did so as he highlighted new plans to persuade <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/mortgages\">mortgage</a> lenders not seek to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/repossessions\">repossess</a> the homes of borrowers unable to pay their arrears. </p> <p>In the Commons Brown followed the example of the chairman of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, and said the country had to prepare for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">recession</a>. </p> <p>Brown told MPs: \"Having taken action on the banking system, we must now take action on the global financial recession.\"</p> <p>He said this was likely to cause \"recession in America, France, Italy, Germany, Japan and - because no country can insulate itself from it - Britain too\".</p> <p>The Conservative party leader, David Cameron, tried to make Brown shoulder some of the blame for Britain's economic malaise, and pointed out that half of the OECD countries were going into the downturn with budget surpluses, making it possible for them to cut taxes for families. </p> <p>\"He claimed the credit in the boom, why won't he take responsibility in the bust?\" Cameron said.</p> <p>Britain will not formally go into recession when the latest growth figures are published tomorrow because there was zero growth as opposed to negative growth in the previous quarter. A recession is technically defined as two successive quarters of negative growth. </p> <p>Brown announced that in the wake of the downturn fresh guidance was being issued to judges to try to reduce the 40,000 repossessions forecast for this year. The Treasury announced new court protocols from the Civil Justice Council designed to make repossessions a last resort.</p> <p>Lenders will now be expected to demonstrate to courts that they have tried to discuss and agree alternatives to repossession when borrowers get into trouble with their mortgage repayments. If a case reaches court, lenders will be required to tell the court precisely what they have done to comply with the protocol. </p> <p>Lenders, under the new guidance, coming into force on November 19, must explore options to help people stay in their home, such as extending their mortgage term, changing the type of mortgage they have, such as switching people to an interest only one, deferring the payment of interest and adding arrears to the overall loan. One of the toughest lenders in terms of repossession has been Northern Rock, owned by the government. </p> <p>In addition the government is proposing that companies engaged in sale and rent back schemes, which may target vulnerable homeowners, should be brought under FSA regulation for the first time. The government is following a recommendation from the Office of Fair Trading.</p> <p>Buoyed by two new opinion polls showing his personal standing is rising, Brown was also complimented by the French president, Nicholas Sarkozy, who proposed that the prime minister be asked to regularly attend meetings of the euro-group of countries over the next year. </p> <p>Brown will also attend a meeting of world leaders on the economy announced yesterday by President Bush for Washington on November 15, 11 days after the US presidential election.</p> <p>A fresh poll by Ipsos MORI shows Labour up six points to 30 points and the Conservatives down seven points to 45 points, with the Liberal Democrats on 14 points up two. A separate poll by YouGov for Channel 4 News showed Labour greatly narrowing its deficit in the must-win marginal seats from 13 points to five.</p>",
  "<p>As the dust of the credit crash clears and the real world recession kicks in, the ideologues of capitalism are scaring themselves with spectres. \"He's back,\" the Times warned its readers on Tuesday over a portrait of Karl Marx. Not only are sales of his masterwork Das Kapital booming, but the virus of the newly fashionable revolutionary has, it seems, spread to the heart of the capitalist camp: the French president Nicolas Sarkozy has had himself photographed leafing through its pages while Marx's analysis of capitalism has been hailed by everyone from the German finance minister to the Pope.</p> <p>In the US, John McCain has been lashing out at Barack Obama for his supposed \"socialism\", the High Tory writer Simon Heffer excitedly dubbed the state bail-out of the banks \"neo-sovietisation\", and the BBC broadcast a prime-time debate last week on whether the crisis signalled the \"death of capitalism\". Meanwhile the Economist, the Pravda of the neoliberal ascendancy, has been trying to mobilise true believers for a fightback: \"Economic liberty is under attack\", its current issue thunders. \"Capitalism is at bay, but those who believe in it must fight for it.\"</p> <p>Of course, they are running ahead of themselves in a panic. If Marx's central ideas about class and exploitation were really taking hold across the western world, you can be sure the mainstream media wouldn't be running quirky, cartoonish pieces and debates about them, but something much more ferocious and alarming. </p> <p>It's certainly true that the events of the past few weeks have exposed deregulated capitalism as bankrupt and its ruling elites as greedy and inept. But it is the free-market model, not capitalism, that is dying. That is reflected in public opinion: a Financial Times-Harris poll conducted across the advanced capitalist world this month found large majorities believe the financial crisis has been caused by \"abuses of capitalism\", rather than the \"failure of capitalism itself\" - only in Germany did the proportion blaming capitalism as a system rise to 30%. </p> <p>As Sarkozy has pronounced: \"Laissez-faire is finished.\" It is not Marx who has really been rehabilitated in short order, but John Maynard Keynes, out of dire necessity. In the wake of the largest-scale acts of state economic intervention in capitalist history, politicians are now having to make a virtue of it. \"Much of what Keynes wrote still makes sense,\" the chancellor Alistair Darling declared at the weekend, as he announced plans to bring forward large capital projects and the prime minister defended higher borrowing to counter falling demand. </p> <p>The symbolic significance of this official return to Keynesianism shouldn't be underestimated. It's 32 years since the then Labour prime minister Jim Callaghan bowed the knee to monetarism, nearly three years before Margaret Thatcher came to power, and announced to his party conference: \"We used to believe that we could spend our way out of a crisis, but I tell you ... it is no longer possible.\" Faced with financial collapse and the threat of a full-scale economic depression, such fancies have now had to be consigned to the dustbin of history.</p> <p>But claims that the current crisis signals the end of capitalism or the birth of a new socialism simply set up a straw man and divert attention from what is in fact at stake. If we're talking about socialism as a systemic alternative, that is clearly not currently on the agenda in the heartlands of capitalism - or elsewhere, with the arguable exception of Latin America. And both its post-communist collapse of confidence and the weakening of the working class as a social and political force make it difficult for the left to take full advantage of capitalism's stark failures.</p> <p>That has led some, such as the historian Eric Hobsbawm, to conclude that the main beneficiaries of the crisis will be the right, as in the 1930s. There's certainly a danger of growing support for rightwing populism on the back of mass unemployment; but if the new enthusiasm for Keynesian intervention and public ownership can be channelled to protect those most vulnerable to the crash - rather than make them pay the price for it, as now seems more likely - that need not be the case.</p> <p>What the crisis is bound to do is increase the demand for alternatives both within capitalism and beyond it. It has already discredited the economic model that has dominated the world for a generation at a cost of endemic instability, rampant inequality and environmental devastation. In its defence of free-market capitalism this week, the Economist argued that, in the past 25 years of market liberalisation, hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of absolute poverty and speculated that this decade may see the fastest growth of income per head in history.</p> <p>But most of that growth and poverty reduction has been in China's state-directed and still heavily publicly-owned economy, while India's lesser capitalist success story is so grotesquely unequally distributed that the proportion of its children who are malnourished - at 47% a global leader - has remained almost unchanged for a decade. For the rest of the world, growth was faster and far more equally shared in the postwar decades of Keynesianism and socialism. </p> <p>An opportunity has now opened up for those political leaders prepared to use this meltdown to reshape the economic system, from Obama to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. It's often said that the left has no alternative model after the implosion of communism and traditional social democracy. But in reality no economic and social model, left or right, has ever come pre-cooked: all of them - from Soviet power to the Keynesian welfare state and Thatcherite-Reaganite neoliberalism - have grown out of ideologically driven improvisation in particular historical circumstances. Marx himself famously offered no blueprint.</p> <p>Instead, the pressure to respond to economic need - as in the New Deal or postwar Europe - will shape the way the new economic order develops. Already, the forms of intervention have been sharply different from past crises, with bank nationalisations offering a potentially powerful new economic lever. We are no doubt heading into a new kind of capitalism as well as a period of growing support for more far-reaching social alternatives. But what form it takes will be decided by pressure, from above and below.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Where were you when Obama was shot? The line we pray we will never have to say. A line that I have hesitated even to write, as if the mere inscribing of the words could invite calamity. Yet the fear preys on the back of our minds, as we see Barack Obama plunging into those crowds. I have now watched weeks of election coverage on the 24/7 television news channels in the United States, in the course of which every tiniest feature of the campaign has been examined to exhaustion, but not once have I heard this mentioned. Yet almost every day I have a private conversation in which the subject comes up, especially when talking to journalists.</p> <p>Is this self-censorship of the media right? Should I not even be writing this? There are unstable, suggestible people out there. Experts may argue about the psychological impact of media coverage of such subjects, but it clearly has some. Earlier this year, a blogger pointed out that \"assassinate Obama\" had that day appeared on a list of Google's top 100 search items.</p> <p>She suggested that newspaper stories about the danger had increased the number of such Google searches - and that her own blog might do the same. As may this column.</p> <p>Yet to ignore this subject completely, never to mention in print what so many are thinking, is to miss something important. Only against this dark background of dread can you appreciate the full irresponsibility of the turn the McCain-Palin campaign has taken towards attacking Obama's character, biography and patriotism - attacks which, in other contexts, we would not hesitate to describe as \"character assassination\". The charge made by Sarah Palin that he has been \"palling around with terrorists\"; the automated calls associating him with \"domestic terrorist\" William Ayers; the underhand insinuation that he is alien, un-, or even anti-American; rhyming Obama with Osama; the absence of instant rebuke when some idiot at a Palin rally cries out \"terrorist!\" or even \"kill him!\".</p> <p>Palin supporters might retort: this is America, not namby-pamby Europe. We fight tough, and we fight to win. A little gouging of the eyes as you roll in the dirt is just fine, in this land of real men. But more responsible Republicans disagree. They argue that, if you really put \"Country First\" - John McCain's campaign motto - you should not travel along this road and risk stirring those demons. It's no accident that Obama was given secret police protection unusually early in the primaries. Watching Colin Powell's measured and eloquent endorsement of Obama, many will have recalled that one widely reported reason Powell himself did not run for president was his wife's fear that he would be assassinated. No serious analyst would dispute that the threat to Obama, however effective his secret police protection, is greater than it would be to a white candidate.</p> <p>Of course the nutters, xenophobes and racists are out there anyway. The point is that nobody should ever be able to claim, with even a shadow of plausibility, that the Republican campaign has given them even a hint of encouragement. I feel it important to record that I have heard several white Republicans say, with real feeling, what a great thing it would be for the US to have a black president.</p> <p>This criticism of the nasty turn taken by the McCain-Palin campaign would lose some of its force if the Obama campaign had been launching comparable attacks on the character and biography of the Republican candidates. Now the Obama camp has done its share of negative campaigning, and the excellent factcheck.org finds that the candidate himself has sometimes misrepresented McCain's policy positions. But he has never resorted to such lowdown personal attacks. In the last presidential debate, he even heroically refrained from questioning Palin's qualifications to be president.</p> <p>His quiet message was: let the American people judge. So the McCain-Palin campaign has been unilaterally playing with fire.</p> <p>The stakes in this election grow higher by the day. It feels like watching a poker game with huge piles of chips accumulating on the table. Both the potential loss and the potential gain are enormous. On the upside is not just the symbolic breakthrough of electing the first African-American president - and a child of the world carrying with him the hopes of the world. It's also the arrival in the world's most important job of someone who has the potential to do it very well.</p> <p>I did not always think this. Last year he still looked inexperienced. But Obama has gained stature through every challenge. For a start, he has shown amazing stamina and strength. Due to the long drawn-out primary contest with Hillary Clinton, he has been campaigning for nearly two years, non-stop. Through all the ups and downs of the campaign, and the financial crisis of recent weeks, he has been cool as a cucumber and steady as a rock. These are qualities we'd like to see in a president.</p> <p>In the debates, he was dignified, well-informed and grownup, making a grimacing McCain look like the temperamental youngster. He greeted the old fighter pilot's attacks with an ironical smile that visibly drove McCain nuts. He has the kind of cryptic detachment that is an asset to any chairman. Personally, he seems centred and rooted. You feel this a man who knows who he is. Not because he has always known who he is, like the heir to \"a long line of McCains\", but because for a long time he didn't - and then worked it out for himself the hard way, through the search recorded in the autobiographical Dreams From My Father. He has, so to speak, the rootedness of the uprooted.</p> <p>He has also cut some of the waffle that we heard earlier in the campaign. On policy, he has demonstrated a clear intellectual grasp of the issues, an ability to absorb and synthesise expert advice, and a consistent focus on a few strategic priorities: the economic condition of the middle class, healthcare, education, energy.</p> <p>Following the last debate, some of the instant reaction pundits on CNN complained that he had been \"professorial\" (what have they got against professors?). Then the polling came in, and it turned out that undecided voters rather liked professorial. After eight years of \"the kind of guy you'd want to drink a beer with\" (W), maybe someone who showed a clear understanding of complex issues would not be so bad. Without counting his chickens before they hatch, Obama is already preparing his personnel lists and policy options for government - determined to make a better start to his first term than Bill Clinton did. With every week, my respect for him has grown.</p> <p>Of course you never know until you know. Will he be bold enough? Can he make the unwieldy machinery of Washington, including his own party's representatives in Congress, work effectively to realise his strategic goals? But everything he has shown us this autumn suggests that he has the potential to be a very good president, perhaps even a great one.</p> <p>These are just some of the reasons why no American election since 1932 has had such a deep downside of fear and such a high upside of hope.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timothygartonash.com\">www.timothygartonash.com</a></p>",
  "<p>President George Bush and fellow world leaders will attempt to thrash out a united response to the global financial crisis next month when Washington hosts an emergency summit.</p> <p>The meeting on November 15 will discuss the underlying causes of the downturn, the global response and the principles that will underpin any reforms, the White House said. Leaders from the group of leading economies - including Brazil, China and India as well as the G7 nations will attend the meeting, which will also seek input from the winner of the US presidential election.</p> <p>However, the White House acknowledged that the first meeting was unlikely to produce concrete proposals for tackling the consequences of the credit crunch. Although the world's biggest economies have followed Gordon Brown's lead in recapitalising their major banks, leaders have expressed divergent views on what future shape global finance should take.</p> <p>Bush has warned that any coordinated international action should preserve free markets but his French counterpart, Nicolas Sarkozy, declared last month that the \"all-powerful market that always knows best is dead\".</p> <p>Dana Perino, a White House spokesman, said she did not expect the summit to present firm decisions on new policy or regulation. The task of putting \"meat on the bones\" after the meeting will be up to financial experts in the world leaders' respective countries, Perino added. \"A lot of work will have to be done at the taskforce level, the working group level,\" she said. Those working groups will then draft recommendations for consideration at further summits.</p> <p>Barack Obama, favourite to win the election that takes place 11 days before the summit, welcomed the announcement by a Bush administration that is making one last push to stabilise the global economy before the new president takes office on January 20.</p>",
  "<p>There is, it turns out, another difference between a pit bull and a hockey mom, when the hockey mom in question is Sarah Palin: more than $150,000 (\u00a392,000) in clothing and accessories from some of America's most upmarket department stores, including $4,716 on hair and makeup, all in the space of a couple of months.</p> <p>While others merely speak of the need to stimulate the US economy, the Republican party seems to have been trying singlehandedly to revive the designer couture sector, it emerged yesterday. </p> <p>Since late August, it has spent more than $125,000 in shopping sprees on behalf of John McCain's running-mate and her family at Saks Fifth Avenue and Nieman Marcus, along with smaller sums at Bloomingdale's, Barney's and Macy's.</p> <p>Details of Palin's shopping trips - including a single outing costing $75,000 - emerged as a new report into campaign finances revealed the cost of the presidential election would easily exceed $1bn, shattering records for fundraising and spending. </p> <p>According to the Centre for Responsive Politics, which monitors political fundraising, the overall cost of the 2008 presidential and congressional elections combined will total $5.3bn, which would buy a lot of tailored suits and wrap shirts from Nieman Marcus. </p> <p>A McCain campaign spokeswoman said it had always been the plan to donate Palin's clothes to charity after the election. </p> <p>\"With all of the important issues facing the country right now,\" said Tracey Schmitt, \"it's remarkable that we're spending time talking about pantsuits and blouses.\"</p> <p>But since the average US household spends around $1,800 on clothes in the course of a whole year, the news did little for Palin's self-promoted image as an anti-elitist American.</p>",
  "<p>The US election campaign, already breaking all records for fundraising and spending, is set to breach the $1bn (\u00a3614m) mark this month, making it the costliest by far in American history. </p> <p>The two candidates had raised a combined total of $961m by the end of September, according to figures released this week. But Barack Obama alone will almost certainly push that over the $1bn mark before the November 4 election. </p> <p>The total cost of the presidential race could be as much as $2.4bn, according to the Centre for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based organisation that tracks political fundraising.</p> <p>The group has calculated that the US elections as a whole could cost $5.3bn when combining the candidates' fundraising with the cost of the congressional election campaign and contributions from unions and other outside organisations and groups. </p> <p>\"The election will blow through historic records on a number of counts,\" said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the centre.</p> <p>In 2004 John Kerry and George Bush raised $880.5m in what was the most expensive election to date.</p> <p>Obama has so much money available that he is easily outspending John McCain in advertising, which is the biggest expenditure.</p> <p>Evan Tracey, president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which monitors spending on advertising, said Obama was close to saturation point. \"There is in essence no limit to what Obama can do. He has the lion's share of spending ... he has more money than TV space to buy,\" Tracey said.</p> <p>Since September Obama has bought 330,000 adverts in all the battleground states compared with 100,000 by McCain, Tracey said. </p> <p>During his political career Obama has seen spending power as a key to victory. He raised a staggering $153m in September, bringing his fundraising total to $603m so far. Of this he has spent $470m. In September alone he spent $96.9m, of which $65m went on advertising, $5m on travel, $1.1m on polling, $1.8m on postage, $1m on setting up stages and $1.2m on credit card fees.</p> <p>He spent $3m on staff wages but this does not begin to reflect the size of his campaign, which has attracted a huge volunteer base. McCain, by contrast, is struggling to attract Republican volunteers and is offering $12 an hour for canvassers in Florida.</p> <p>While Obama is free to continue with fundraising efforts this month, McCain has been hobbled by having accepted public finance of $84m that prevents him from raising funds separately. </p> <p>Having spent $37m of that in September, he had only $47m - which in normal times would have been seen as a substantial sum - for the remainder of the campaign.</p> <p>Outside Obama's campaign team, his biggest backers are the trade unions, who are spending tens of millions on advertising and campaign staff. </p> <p>The United Steelworkers union, for instance, has 120 full-time staff working on campaigning for Obama, in addition to volunteers. </p> <p>Gary Hubbard, a spokesman for the union, was yesterday unable to put an immediate figure on union spending but added: \"Democracy ain't cheap.\"</p> <p>The Obama team likes to portray its fundraising as a populist movement driven mainly by small donors, contributing $200 or less. </p> <p>But in an analysis of the 800-page file on fundraising and spending submitted by Obama under election law, the Washington Post found that only a quarter of the $600m raised so far had come from small donors.</p> <p>McCain potentially has access to the $80m-plus the Republican party has in the bank but some state party officials - either because of coolness towards McCain on ideological grounds or because they do not want to waste cash on what they see as a losing campaign - have withheld funds.</p> <h2>Election inflation</h2> <p>Amount raised by all candidates in previous elections</p> <p><strong>1976 </strong>(winner Jimmy Carter)$171m</p> <p><strong>1980 </strong>(Ronald Reagan)$161.9m</p> <p><strong>1984</strong> (Reagan)$202m</p> <p><strong>1988 (</strong>George Bush)$324.4m</p> <p><strong>1992</strong> (Bill Clinton)$331.1m</p> <p><strong>1996</strong> (Clinton)$425.7m</p> <p><strong>2000</strong> (George W Bush)$528.9m</p> <p><strong>2004</strong> (Bush)$880.5m</p>",
  "<p>From the moment she appeared on the vice-presidential campaign stage, with her serious but hintingly sexy spectacles, that dramatically swept-up hair and working mom suits paired with surprisingly high heels, Sarah Palin has pitched her style perfectly, treading a tricky line between heartlands mom and all American bombshell that could not fail to appeal to her rightwing fans.</p> <p>Her favourite outfit of a boxy jacket paired with a notably tight skirt, almost always in black or red, exemplifies her image perfectly, and how she has used her femininity as an advantage whereas Hillary Clinton tried to downplay it in unfortunately hued trouser suits.</p> <p>But all public images are hard to maintain on an international stage and it turns out that Palin's down-on-the-ranch look has been more high maintenance than Michelle Obama's \"elite liberal east coast\" look.</p> <p>Since early September, the Republican National Committee (RNC) has spent more than $150,000 dressing the Palins, shopping at department stores across the country. According to financial disclosure records, there was a $75,062.63 spree in Neiman-Marcus in Minneapolis, Minnesota and $5,102.71 in New York. Other purchases included a $92 romper and matching hat with ears for Palin's baby, Trig, at a baby store in Minneapolis. It is unlikely that her fellow \"American moms\" have such a budget.</p> <p>The Republicans have been trying to pitch themselves as the party for the heartland's hardworking man: Cindy McCain appeared at the Republican national convention in an outfit costing around $300,000. Michelle Obama, by contrast, was estimated to have spent $1,500 on her outfit for the Democratic national convention.</p> <p>It is likely, though, that McCain, a multimillionaire, and Obama spent their own cash, whereas money for Palin's makeover has come from the RNC's own funds, and some have questioned the legality of such spending. </p> <p>A spokesman insisted the clothing would \"go to a charitable purpose after the campaign\". That will be hard to break to her children. One of the most enduring images from the Republican convention is a photo of Piper, her seven-year-old daughter, clutching a Louis Vuitton handbag.</p>",
  "<p>If recession is our fate, as Gordon Brown and the Bank of England's governor Mervyn King now believe, then we will just have to learn to cope with it. Live more frugally. Take our pleasures where we can. The credit crunch has hit the Republic of Ireland too, but last week, as the edifices of the financial world continued to crumble, a trendy Dublin nightspot was filled with Bank of Ireland staff on a jolly. And the theme? Casino. They spent the entire night gambling. Eyebrows will be raised, of course; but we say, that's the spirit. Ching, ching, ching. Spend, spend, spend. </p> <p>\u2022 More questions yesterday about the judgment of George Osborne. Why did he hang around to discuss money with Deripaska? Why did he gossip about Nat Rothschild's private party? Why indeed, he may now reflect, did he go to Taverna Agni, the restaurant in north-eastern Corfu? It's speciality is deep-fried \"hard cheese\". </p> <p>\u2022 But then it has been an inexorable rise for the shadow chancellor. A hero for the suits and the blue rinses. Much feted, much in demand. His office has of late been fobbing off those who would spend time with him via a prepared email. \"Regretfully Mr Osborne is unable to accept as he is already committed on that date,\" it says. \"His diary is under increasing pressure, so he is not able to take part in as many events as he would like.\" There will, of course, be considerably less pressure on his time now he has been exposed to all as a high society blabbermouth. Weddings, bar mitzvahs, stag dos. Just ask. He'll come. </p> <p>\u2022 Leave it a week or so, however, because things are obviously bad just now. The kennel door swung open late afternoon. Someone unleashed Tebbit. \"If you sleep with dogs, you are likely to get fleas,\" he said of the shadow chancellor on News 24; but soon he was back in the old routine, baring his teeth at the socialists. He is as much gum as dentures these days, but all the same it might pay Denis MacShane to seek out a tetanus jab. He could outrun the old boy, but there's a risk.</p> <p>\u2022 While the controversy unfolds, we find that joy is unconfined on the Labour benches, and on further inquiry we learn more about why Tony McNulty, the employment minister, is still the government's go-to guy whenever there is a problem. Unemployment is higher than it has been in a decade and likely to rise higher, and so we take heart from the fact that the MP, according to his Facebook entry, has recently completed the online quiz: \"How do you handle awkward situations you cannot fix?\" He has been six years as a minister, but still he seeks to learn, improve his skills. He is leading by example. Admirable.</p> <p>\u2022 As is John McCain, in many ways, but for all that his poll numbers are slipping. The Republicans are worried, as are evangelicals at the inJesus online community. They have been looking into this, and think they have found out why. \"Witches, warlocks and those involved in satanism and the occult get up daily at 3am to release curses against McCain and Palin so B Hussein Obama is elected,\" they report, with some agitation. The answer is simple. \"If you know how to do spiritual warfare, please pray today and continually that all such curses be broken. If you do not know how to do spiritual warfare, it is time you learn!!!\" </p> <p>\u2022 And finally, one can see why Portsmouth FC is schooling its foreign players in touchline English, with 16 imports in a squad of 28 and a manager for whom cockney is the mother tongue. They learn that \"open your minces\" means \"open your eyes\", but the process is never immediate. \"There's no point teaching 'my uncle's pen is in your auntie's bureau',\" says the man in charge of the tuition, when what is required are phrases such as \"on me 'ead\". Faced with a similar barrier to understanding, CNN International has taken to running its interviews with Celtic's Edinburgh-born manager Gordon Strachan accompanied by subtitles. It means the viewers know what he's saying, even when his players don't have a clue. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> began to speak openly and in detail about the post-election transition period from George Bush's presidency for the first time yesterday, opening himself up to charges of complacency.</p> <p>As most polls showed the Democratic candidate's lead over his Republican rival <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> still growing, Obama held a meeting in Richmond, Virginia, to discuss with senior national security advisers the foreign policy challenges he would face as president. Bucking the trend, one poll, conducted by Associated Press, showed McCain cutting back Obama's 7% lead three weeks ago to 1%, on 44% to 43%. </p> <p>Obama's comments mark a significant change in the campaign, switching from rhetoric to a more presidential tone. </p> <p>Although Obama added the caveat that \"I don't want to get too far ahead of myself,\" his comments reflected a sense of confidence that his campaign team is finding it hard to hide. At a press conference after the national security meeting, he said that although he had been almost single-mindedly focused on the economy, he had plans ready for Iraq, Afghanistan and other foreign policy problems. </p> <p>He spoke about having teams in place to deal with foreign and economic policy during the awkward transitional period between November 4 and the inauguration on January 20.</p> <p>Interviewed yesterday, Obama said a smooth transition was essential to make sure America's enemies did not take advantage of a shift in administrations. </p> <p>In another sign of looking beyond the November 4 election, he welcomed a White House-organised international summit on the economic crisis planned for November 15. With Bush as a lame-duck president and Obama as possibly the president-in-waiting, the Democratic candidate would be a key figure. \"I am happy today that the White House announced a summit that provides an opportunity to advance the kind of cooperation I called for last month,\" he said. \"America must lead and other nations must be part of the solution too.\" He refused to be drawn into what role he would play at the summit if he was elected president. He said his economic team was already in constant touch with the treasury secretary, Henry Paulson.</p> <p>To avoid sounding too presumptuous, he said: \"Even though the election will have taken place and there will be a new president-elect, we are still going to have one president at a time until January 20, until the new president is sworn in.\"</p> <p>It is risky for Obama to speak so openly about the post-election period with 13 days still to go of the campaign. While his appearance surrounded by national security experts from the Clinton administration and Washington-based thinktanks can make him appear more presidential, it also opens him up to accusations by McCain that he has become too cocky.</p> <p>McCain told a rally yesterday before Obama's meeting that his rival was behaving as if he was already president to the extent that he would be making an address to the nation next.</p> <p>The meeting with his national security advisers and a rally planned for Leesburg, Virginia, last night will be among Obama's last events before heading for Hawaii for two days to visit the grandmother who helped raise him and who is seriously ill.</p> <p>The meeting in Richmond and the subsequent press conference were designed partly to try to deflect comments made by his vice-presidential running-mate, Joe Biden, on Sunday. Biden, who is famously gaffe-prone, said that Obama as president could expect to face international crises as America's opponents sought to test him.</p> <p>Both McCain and his running-mate, Sarah Palin, jumped on this, saying America's enemies perceived Obama as weak and would seek to test him.</p> <p>Obama responded: \"His core point was the next president is going to be tested regardless of who it is.\"</p> <p>Palin too found herself on the defensive yesterday when an Associated Press investigation found what appeared to be a cover-up in relation to expenses claimed as governor of Alaska. As was reported last month, Palin charged the state more than $21,000 to cover the cost of her children travelling with her. But AP found that documents appear to have been amended afterwards to specify that the trips were on official business.</p>",

  "<p>Navel-gazing commentators in American journalism schools love to lament the dumbing-down of US political culture, but recently they've had no cause for complaint: the focus of debate has been the very nature of reality itself. At a campaign stop last week, Sarah Palin congratulated her audience for living in \"the real America\", and spoke of her love for \"the pro-American areas\" of America, a truly mindbending concept that may cause injury if you reflect on it for too long. </p> <p>Meanwhile, as John McCain watches the once solidly Republican state of Virginia slip out of his grasp, the latest campaign talking-point is that northern Virginia - the Washington suburbs where the Democratic vote is strongest - isn't \"real Virginia\" at all. Naturally, such distinctions enrage liberals, who resent the idea that not voting Republican equals a lack of patriotism. But the McCain/Palin definition of \"reality\" caught up with a prominent Republican too this week when Nancy Pfotenhauer, a senior McCain adviser, told a TV interviewer that she herself, Pfotenhauer, lived in a part of Virginia that she didn't consider to be real, whereupon she immediately vanished in a puff of smoke, leaving only an empty studio chair and the faint aroma of absurdity.</p> <p>Perhaps she's gone to \"the celebrity land\", another mystical world invoked by Palin this week. \"We were on the bus today, we were making a list of who are some celebrity singers who could come out and help us, and gosh, for the life of us, the pickins were slim there!\" the Alaska governor told a crowd. \"Who's quasi-conservative out there in the celebrity land?\" The correct answer to this question is \"the actor Robert Duvall and that guy from Metallica\". But that's hardly the point: Palin's apparent ability to perceive all these multiple dimensions raises the serious possibility that she is operating from a plane of intelligence so elevated, so completely inaccessible to all but a few of the world's leading superstring theorists, that it wrongly appears to the rest of us very much like immense stupidity.</p> <p>Contrast Palin's fondness for \"the real America\" with the disdain for reality demonstrated by the anonymous George Bush aide who famously described the president's critics as belonging to \"the reality-based community\". (\"We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality,\" the source told the journalist Ron Suskind in a now legendary 2004 New York Times article.) Which is more worrying: that the Bush White House believed reality could be ignored, or that Palin thinks her opponents aren't real? Actually, don't answer that.</p> <p><strong>Making sure people show up at the polls on election day </strong>is crucially important work, of course, and one hesitates to mock any well-meaning effort to get out the vote. But can we make an exception for Ben &amp; Jerry's, the ice-cream company whose ostentatious stance of corporate community-mindedness as a marketing tool is almost as annoying as the cutesy names of their flavours? Fresh from getting free publicity from Cherries for Change, their pro-Obama repackaging of Cherry Garcia, the firm has launched a voter-reward campaign offering a free scoop of ice-cream for anyone who can prove they voted on November 4. \"Show us your 'I Voted' sticker, a photo of you in front of your polling station, do the I Voted Dance, or just tell us you voted!\" the company's website proclaims excitedly. Which would be a marvellous democracy-enhancing wheeze were it not for the fact that offering any kind of recompense for a vote where federal candidates are on the ballot is an offence under US law. \"If I were Ben &amp; Jerry's lawyer, I'd tell them to shut this down,\" writes Rick Hasen, an expert on voting legislation at Loyola law school in Los Angeles, and also, it would appear, a crotchety spoilsport who probably just needs a few more scoops of New York Super Fudge Chunk and a big hug.</p> <p><strong>Another voter-reward scheme that may be in breach of </strong>the law: John McCain's daughter, Meghan, has told New Hampshire voters that if her father wins there she'll have the state motto, Live Free or Die, tattooed on to her body. Not many things are to John McCain's credit at the moment, but one of them is the fact that he's letting his daughter join him on the campaign trail without dictating what she says to the press - a far cry from Chelsea Clinton's message-repeating appearances, let alone Mitt Romney's five sons, who during the primaries ran a strictly on-message and vaguely terrifying weblog, the Five Brothers Blog, in support of their disconcerting father. Meghan McCain, who runs an entirely amiable website at McCainBlogette.com, has called Barack Obama \"cute\", reported drunken evenings in karaoke bars on the trail, offered candid thoughts on her father's campaign strategies (Mike Huckabee as vice-president, she noted months ago, was \"not gonna happen\"), and spoken of the perils of dating a supporter of eccentric libertarian superhero Ron Paul: \"He collected Barbie dolls. I called my girlfriends after and was like, 'That's weird, right?'\" </p> <p>Turns out that there is a straight-talkin', likable maverick named McCain after all. What a pity they nominated that short-tempered, impetuous, negative-campaigning demagogue instead!</p> <p><strong>This week Oliver watched</strong> Sarah Palin's appearance on Saturday Night Live: \"She said almost nothing, so it was a triumph.\" <strong>He also spent</strong> far too long reading rightwing American blogs: \"You wouldn't believe the things I've heard about Michelle Obama. Which is just as well, because most of them are completely made up.\"</p>",

(They've hardly been helped by McCain himself, who emerges from the piece as intransigent and ill-disciplined, refusing to do campaign events before 9am and either ignoring his strategists' advice or taking it too far, as when he said \"Senator Obama doesn't understand\", or words to that effect, 10 times during the first debate.) If the piece is short on stunning new revelations, it's rich with atmosphere, most notably this comically cinematic summit of McCain advisors headed by senior strategist Steve Schmidt, above, in July:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"Gentlemen, let me put a few things on the table for observation and discussion,\" Steve Schmidt said to his fellow strategists while sitting in a conference room in the Phoenix Ritz-Carlton. \"Would anyone here disagree with the premise that we are not winning this campaign?\"<br>No one disagreed. It was Sunday, July 27, and Obama had just concluded an eight-day swing through the Middle East and Europe that received practically round-the-clock media coverage. \"Would anyone disagree with the premise,\" Schmidt went on, \"that Mr. Obama has scored the most successful week in this entire campaign? I mean, they treated him like he was a head of state! So tell me, gentlemen: how do we turn this negative into a positive?\"<br>\"It's third and nine,\" Bill McInturff, a pollster, observed. \"Time to start throwing the ball down field.\"<br>Eventually, it was Schmidt who blurted out the epiphany concerning Obama. \"Face it, gentlemen,\" he said. \"He's being treated like a celebrity.\"<br>The others grasped the concept \u2014 a celebrity like J-Lo! or Britney! \u2014 and exultation overtook the room.</p> </blockquote> <p>And then there's this ornithologically detailed account of the conversation -- \"beside a creek and a sycamore tree, where a rare breed of hawk seasonally nested\" -- where McCain realised Sarah Palin was the one for him:</p> <blockquote> <p>[Mark] Salter and Schmidt drove Palin to McCain's ranch. According to Salter, the senator took the governor down to a place where he usually had his coffee, beside a creek and a sycamore tree, where a rare breed of hawk seasonally nested. They spoke for more than an hour. Then the two of them walked about 40 yards to the deck of the cabin where the McCains slept. Cindy joined them there for about 15 minutes, after which the McCains excused themselves and went for a brief stroll to discuss the matter. When they returned, McCain asked for some time with Schmidt and Salter. \"And we did our pros and cons on all of them,\" Salter told me. \"He just listened. Asked a couple of questions. Then said, 'I'm going to offer it to her.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Whereupon the narrative abruptly changed from Real Leader vs Celebrity to Team of Mavericks Taking On The Washington Powers That Be. </p> <blockquote> <p>Schmidt, to whom [Rick] Davis quietly supplied the Palin footage, agreed. Neither man apparently saw her lack of familiarity with major national or international issues as a serious liability.</p> </blockquote> <p>Since we know what happened next, the dramatic irony is spine-tingling. The overwhelming sense in the piece is an odd combination of constant, seat-of-the-pants crisis-fighting and complacency -- a constitutional predisposition presumably imbued in McCain's advisors by McCain himself. (You just know the equivalent Obama campaign piece would be boring by comparison.) Whatever happens on November 4, the inside story of McCain's campaign will make a great documentary-style TV movie one day. They could call it A Rare Breed of Hawk.<br></p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14829.html\">new study</a> shows that McCain has received highly negative media coverage since September:</p> <blockquote> <p>Just 14 percent of the stories about John McCain from the conventions through the final presidential debate were positive in tone, according to a study released today, while nearly 60 percent were negative\u2014the least favorable coverage of any of the 4 candidates on the ticket.</p> <p>The study, by The Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism, a non-partisan journalism watchdog organization, examined 2,412 stories from 43 newspapers and cable news shows in the six-week period beginning just after the conventions and ending with the final presidential debate.</p> </blockquote> <p>Them's the facts. Then comes the expert explanation:</p> <blockquote> <p>Much of the increased attention for McCain derived from actions by the senator himself, actions that, in the end, generated mostly negative assessments,\" the study found. \"In many ways, the arc of the media narrative during this phase of the 2008 general election might best be described as a drama in which John McCain acted and Barack Obama reacted.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In other words, McCain has received negative coverage because...he's run a negative and gimmicky and lousy campaign! Well, no kidding. But I admire Pew for saying it, in not so many words. But it's one more thing for wingers to whine about.<br></p>",
  "<p>The \"precision attack\" levied by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/17/nato-afghanistan\">James Appathurai</a> (October 17, 2008) upon <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/16/afghanistan-nato\">Seumas Milne's column</a> in the Guardian bears the usual trappings of Nato-speak and actions (truth as collateral damage). From 2006 to mid-2008, US/Nato aerial attacks killed 1,488 Afghan civilians with 1,458 tonnes of bombs, whereas between October 7 and December 10, 2001 US war planes dropped 14,000 tonnes of bombs resulting in 2,569-2,949 dead Afghan civilians (or 18-21 civilians killed per 100 tonnes of US bombs). </p> <p>Notwithstanding Appathurai's righteous indignation neither Milne nor I are saying that Nato deliberately targets civilians. This is the old canard about intentionality. We are saying that Nato's aerial bombing in Afghanistan as an action reveals far more than Nato's pious words. The data (actions) belie Nato-speak. The relative lethality for Afghan civilians of Nato's close air support strikes far exceeds the lethality of the US strategic bombing of Laos and Cambodia. The lethality of close air support air strikes to Afghan civilians as measured by the ratio of civilians killed per 100 tonnes of bombs dropped is:</p> <p>\u2022 2006: 125-148<br>\u2022 2007: 119-153<br>\u2022 2008: 29-36</p> <p>In all three years, the lethality of US bombing in Afghanistan exceeded by far that recorded in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Yugoslavia, Iraq (2003) and Afghanistan (2001). By relying upon aerial close air support (CAS) attacks, US/Nato forces spare their pilots and ground troops but kill lots of innocent Afghan civilians. Air strikes are four to ten times as deadly for Afghan civilians as are ground attacks. And just for the record, so-called precision bombs were initially developed to save US pilots' lives and US taxpayers' dollars, not to spare civilian lives. If John McCain had been carrying JDAM munitions over North Vietnam he may not have had to make as many bombing runs and gotten shot down. </p> <p>Predictably, Appathurai proffers the Nato-speak about \"the Taliban's deliberate policy to use civilians as human shields\". Evidence? None is necessary as years of bashing the Taliban has prepared most persons to accept such nonsense. This myth has circulated since the beginning of the US bombing campaign in Afghanistan in October 2001. It is endlessly repeated by the US occupation forces, corporate media, the Pentagon, defence intellectual pundits, Human Rights Watch, the Cruise Missile Left, the humanitarian interventionists, and even some in the United Nations: Afghan insurgents hide among civilians whom they use as human shields. </p> <p>To begin with, the assertion is never empirically documented but merely stated as a self-evident truth. Second, the implication is that an insurgent or Taliban fighter, resisting the US/Nato invasion should stand alone on a mountain ridge, his AK-47 raised to the sky, and engage in a \"fair\" act of war with an Apache attack helicopter or A-10 Warthog and see who prevails. Should resistance fighters stand out in an open field or on a mountain ridge? Third, what is conveniently omitted is that the insurgents often live in the area, have friends and families in the communities, and that such a local support base is precisely what gives a guerrilla insurgency (along with knowledge of the local terrain) its classic advantage. </p> <p>Such local connection means that the insurgents will (unlike the US/Nato occupation forces) go to great lengths to not put local people in danger. Purveyors of the line about the \"Taliban's execrable tactic of using civilians as human shields\" are either themselves unaware of classic guerrilla strategy or, more likely, seek to manipulate the general public's ignorance about the same. Using the language of guerrilla warfare, can a \"fish\" swim outside of the \"sea\"? One recalls the US military's campaign in Vietnam to drain the sea by creating strategic hamlets (translate, concentration camps), seeking to deny the Vietnamese resistance access to sympathetic villagers. </p> <p>Rather than the \"hiding among civilians\" canard, what is happening is that civilians figure prominently in the vast numbers of \"militants\" or \"insurgents\" reported killed in US/Nato bombing, as I have documented countless times in the <a href=\"http://pubpages.unh.edu/%7Emwherold/memorial.htm\">Afghan Victim Memorial Project</a>. The latest egregious example involves the slaughter of over 90 Afghan civilians in Azizabad where for weeks the US military asserted that 30 \"Taliban\" had been killed and no civilians. In other words, civilians killed by US/Nato action are being falsely labelled by the US/Nato as \"eliminated militants\", which suggests that my overall count of civilians killed is a gross underestimate. In addition, no doubt many cases exist where civilians have been killed by US/Nato action simply are not reported (censorship by omission).</p> <p>What needs to be made very clear is that Afghan civilian casualties are not accidents or mistakes. They result from careful calculation by US commanders and military attorneys who decide upon the benefits of an air strike versus the costs in innocent civilian lives lost. These are calculated predicted deaths made all the worse when US/Nato air or ground assaults are carried out in the middle of the night when the typical Afghan family numbering six to seven members is asleep. Are we surprised that 72% of the identifiable Afghan civilians killed by the US/Nato during the first eight months of 2008 are women and children?</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama began to speak openly and in detail about the post-election transition period from George Bush's presidency for the first time today, opening himself up to charges of complacency.</p> <p>As most polls showed the Democratic candidate's lead over his Republican rival John McCain still growing, Obama held a meeting in Richmond, Virginia, to discuss with senior national security advisers the foreign policy challenges he would face as president. Bucking the trend, one poll, conducted by the Associated Press, showed McCain drawing even and putting Obama's lead at 44%-43%.</p> <p>Obama's comments mark a significant change in the campaign, switching from rhetoric to a more presidential tone.</p> <p>Although Obama added the caveat that \"I don't want to get too far ahead of myself,\" his comments reflected a sense of confidence that his campaign team is finding it hard to hide. At a press conference after the national security meeting, he said that although he had been almost single-mindedly focused on the economy, he had plans ready for Iraq, Afghanistan and other foreign policy problems.</p> <p>He spoke about having teams in place to deal with foreign and economic policy during the awkward transitional period between November 4 and the inauguration of the new president on January 20.</p> <p>Interviewed today, Obama said a smooth White House transition was essential to make sure America's enemies did not take advantage of a shift in administrations.</p> <p>In another sign of looking beyond the November 4 election, he welcomed a White House-organised international summit on the economic crisis planned for after the election, on November 15. With Bush as a lame-duck president and Obama as possibly the president-in-waiting, the Democratic candidate would be a key figure. \"I am happy today that the White House announced a summit that provides an opportunity to advance the kind of cooperation I called for last month.</p> <p>\"America must lead and other nations must be part of the solution too,\" he said. He refused to be drawn into what role he would play at the summit if he was elected president. He said his economic team was already in constant touch with the Treasury secretary, Henry Paulson.</p> <p>To avoid sounding too presumptuous, he said: \"Even though the election will have taken place and there will be a new president-elect, we are still going to have one president at a time until January 20, until the new president is sworn in.\"</p> <p>It is risky for Obama to speak so openly about the post-election period with 13 days still to go of the campaign. While his appearance surrounded by national security experts from the Clinton administration and Washington-based think-tanks can make him appear more presidential, it also opens him up to accusations by McCain that he has become too cocky.</p> <p>McCain told a rally today before Obama's meeting that his rival was behaving as if he was already president to the extent that he would be making an address to the nation next.</p> <p>The meeting with his national security advisers a rally planned for Leesburg, Virginia, tonight and a campaign stop in Indianapolis on Thursday will be Obama's last events before heading for Hawaii for two days to visit the grandmother who helped raise him and who is seriously ill.</p> <p>The meeting in Richmond and the subsequent press conference were designed partly to try to deflect comments made by his vice-presidential running mate, Joe Biden, on Sunday. Biden, who is famously gaffe-prone, said that Obama as president could expect to face international crises as America's opponents sought to test him.</p> <p>Both McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, jumped on this, saying America's enemies perceived Obama as weak and will seek to test him because of this.</p> <p>Obama responded: \"His core point was the next president is going to be tested regardless of who it is.\"</p> <p>Sarah Palin too found herself on the defensive today when an Associated Press investigation found what appeared to be a cover-up in relation to expenses claimed as governor of Alaska. As was reported last month, Palin charged the state more than $21,000 to cover the cost of her children travelling with her. But AP found that documents appear to have been amended afterwards to specify that the trips were on official business.</p>",
  "<p>Liberal journalists are combing the back roads of America looking for evidence of the resurgent racism being generated by the prospect of a black man becoming president. The striking thing is how little they've turned up in a country of 300m people with plenty of racial conflict in its history.</p> <p>Here's <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jj1kZCWbZuJPjZJmiXBDDMgAOJcQD93SDSC84\">how the Associated Press led a roundup story</a> on Friday: \"Race, an inescapable but explosive issue on which both presidential candidates have tread carefully if not tried to ignore, is increasingly popping up as it's becoming more likely the country will elect its first black president.\"</p> <p>But since they couldn't find anything coming from John McCain, Sarah Palin or any of their staff or surrogates that would justify such a claim, the first evidence cited was that Democratic congressmen John Murtha and John Lewis had accused Barack Obama's opponents of racism.</p> <p>Eventually the AP story got around to citing the evidence of racism directed toward Obama that its vast nationwide reporting staff had turned up:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 In San Bernardino County, California, the October newsletter of the Chaffey Community Republican Women, Federated, showed Obama's face on a phoney $10 government food stamp coupon adorned with a watermelon, ribs and a bucket of fried chicken. Diane Fedele, president of the group, apologised and she had no racist intent: \"It was just food to me. It didn't mean anything else.\" The state GOP denounced the newsletter.</p> <p>\u2022 In Nevada, Colorado and Michigan, TV ads show a clip of [the Rev Jeremiah] Wright declaring \"God damn America!\" in a sermon. \"How can we forget these hateful sermons from Obama's pastor for over 20 years?\" says one ad by the Our Country Deserves Better PAC, a Sacramento, California-based group that was formed to campaign against Obama.</p> <p>\u2022 In Danville, Virginia, The Voice, a local newspaper, published a column by McCain's Buchanan County campaign chairman, Bobby May, that mocked an Obama administration. It said he would change the national anthem to the \"Black National Anthem\" while mandating that churches teach black liberation theology. Also, it said Obama would appoint Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson to the Cabinet and put prominent blacks like Oprah Winfrey on currency. McCain's campaign dropped May from his job.</p> <p>\u2022 In West Plains, Missouri, a remote town of 10,000 people near the Arkansas border, a prominent highway sign by an unknown creator shows a turban-wearing cartoon caricature of Obama, with an exaggerated smile, full lips and oversized teeth. It says: \"Barack 'Hussein' Obama equals more abortions, same-sex marriages, taxes, gun regulations.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So what do we have here? One unknown group in Sacramento has run some ads reminding voters that Obama's decades-long pastor and spiritual adviser is pretty radical. The fact that Wright is black doesn't make that a racist argument. If McCain had sat in the pew for 20 years <a href=\"http://www.actupny.org/YELL/falwell.html\">listening to a pastor</a> who said, say, that \"the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians are responsible for the 9/11 attacks because they caused God to withdraw his protection for America,\" you can bet that would be an issue.</p> <p>Otherwise, the AP has found three individuals in remote towns who have directed racial slurs at the first black candidate with a real chance to be president. That's pretty remarkable. We've made great progress since the civil rights revolution, but who would have guessed there'd be so little backlash?</p> <p>That won't stop journalists from looking for it, though. Google \"Obama racism\", and you'll find hits like <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2198397/\">\"Racism is the only reason Obama might lose\"</a> (because of course the most liberal Democrat in the Senate would be a shoo-in otherwise) and <a href=\"http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2008/02/20/racist-attacks-on-obama-growing-more-heated/\">\"Racist attacks on Obama growing more heated\"</a> (yes, on white supremacist and neo-Nazi websites) and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/19/racist-obama-effigy-hung_n_135971.html\">\"Racist Obama effigy hung in Ohio\"</a> (yes, one guy in rural Ohio hung a white-sheeted ghost labelled \"Obama\" in his yard, and his white neighbours are appalled).</p> <p>On the web Sunday we got the headline <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14728.html\">\"'Socialist', 'Muslim' \u2013 Ugly reception for Obama\"</a>, who campaigned in the Cape Fear BBQ and Chicken in Fayetteville, North Carolina. But in fact it appears that there was just one woman who shouted \"socialist\" at him and also told a reporter that she suspected he was a \"closet Muslim\". The other white diners told her to quiet down and be civil. Reporters descended on her, though, and she did manage to direct a slur at General Colin Powell, who had endorsed Obama that morning: She called him \"a Rino, R-I-N-O, Republican In Name Only\".<br> Compared to the level of open <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/reader/1403962529/ref=sib_rdr_toc?ie=UTF8&amp;p=S004&amp;j=0#reader-page\">anti-Catholic bias against John Kennedy</a> in 1960, racism in the 2008 campaign is a dog that didn't bark.</p>",
  "<p>The Republican party has spent $150,000 (\u00a392,000) on clothes and accessories since late August for Sarah Palin and her family, according to records of party spending.</p> <p>The Republican shopping sprees, including a $75,000 jaunt to the upscale store Neiman Marcus, began showing up on financial disclosure reports in early September, just after Palin was chosen as John McCain's running mate.</p> <p>Palin often depicts herself as a homespun product of small-town \"real America\"on the campaign trail, but she was revealed last month to be working with a secret team of stylists on sharpening her dress sense.</p> <p>Today's reports on the Palin family's elaborate spending habits \u2013 a $295 pram was among the purchases as a treat for baby Trig, according to politco.com \u2013 could hurt the Republicans' credibility. The election is less than two weeks away.</p> <p>The former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards became a national joke last year after campaign financial reports showed him spending $400 on haircuts. McCain and his wife, Cindy, were plagued this year by reports of $500 shoes and a $300,000 party ensemble respectively.</p> <p>\"The campaign does not comment on strategic decisions regarding how financial resources available to the campaign are spent,\" Palin's spokeswoman, Maria Comella, told politico.com, declining to confirm that the fashion expenses were exclusively for Palin.</p> <p>No similar shopping trips were reported by the Republican party before Palin became McCain's running mate.</p> <p>The Neiman Marcus branch where Republicans shopped in September was located in Minneapolis, the site of the party's national convention where Palin was introduced as McCain's running mate. Republicans spent $9,440 at a Macy's shop in the city during the same period. Another $4,900 was registered at Atelier, a men's fashion emporium, suggesting Palin's husband Todd was treated to a new wardrobe.</p> <p>Reimbursements for many of the Palin purchases in Minneapolis were made to Jeff Larson, a powerful Republican consultant in Minnesota whose firm has been tied to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/20/uselections2008-democrats\">recent round of negative robocalls</a> purchased by the McCain campaign. </p> <p>Larson's discounted apartment-rental arrangement with Norm Coleman, Minnesota's Republican senator, has also prompted a storm of criticism from Democrats.</p> <p>Palin's makeover was not limited to attire, according to a lengthy story due to be published this weekend in the New York Times. The vice-presidential hopeful worked with Priscilla Shanks, a voice coach and Hollywood actor, to help refine her speaking style before her speech at the Republican convention.</p> <p>Palin also received pricey makeup advice from Amy Strozzi, a cosmetics artist best known for her work on the US version of the Strictly Come Dancing TV show. Strozzi received more than $13,000 for making up Palin last month, the Washington Post reported. McCain's makeup artist, also borrowed from the TV dancing show, was paid $8,672 for beautifying the Republican nominee in September.</p> <p>Palin has billed her home state of Alaska, where she is governor, for more than $21,000 for taking her five children on official trips \u2013 even when they were not invited.</p> <p>Palin claimed $17,000 in per diem reimbursements from her state's government for nights spent at her family home in Wasilla, Alaska. <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122334021713509963.html\">Tax experts</a> have questioned the propriety of those claims, which were not added to her annual income tax returns.</p> <p>\"With all of the important issues facing the country right now, it's remarkable that we're spending time talking about pantsuits and blouses,\" said the McCain campaign's spokeswoman, Tracey Schmitt. </p> <p>\"It was always the intent that the clothing go to a charitable purpose after the campaign.\"</p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/22/giulianis-nasty-robocall_n_136926.html\">new sleazy robocall from Rudy Giuliani</a>, whose text is as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>Hi, this is Rudy Giuliani and I'm calling for John McCain and the Republican National Committee, because you need to know that Barack Obama opposes mandatory prison sentences for sex offenders, drug dealers, and murderers. It's true, I read Obama's words myself. And recently, Congressional liberals introduced a bill to eliminate mandatory prison sentences for violent criminals -- trying to give liberal judges the power to decide whether criminals are sent to jail or set free. With priorities like these, we just can't trust the inexperience and judgment of Barack Obama and his liberal allies. This call was paid for by the Republican National Committee and McCain-Palin 2008.</p> </blockquote> <p>As HuffPo notes:</p> <blockquote> <p>It should be noted that Obama has said he would \"immediately review sentences to see where we can be smarter on crime and reduce the ineffective warehousing of nonviolent drug offenders.\" His stance is bolstered by several studies of criminal behavior which show that \"mandatory minimum sentences are less effective than discretionary sentencing and drug treatment in reducing drug-related crime.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Giuliani, as a New Yorker, knows this to be true with regard to non-violent drug offenders. New York is home to the infamous Rockefeller guidelines, which treated nonviolent drug offenders practically like murderers -- long, mandatory sentences. Rockfeller was Nelson Rockefeller, the GOP governor of New York back in the 60s and 70s who, in an effort to shed his moderate image, pressed for the get-tough approach. They've been a disaster for New York, as it costs billions to keep non-violent offenders in prison for 20 or 30 years. As the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_drug_laws\">Wiki entry</a> says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Both the New York and Michigan statutes came under harsh criticism from both the political left and the political right (William F. Buckley, one of the most conservative public figures in America, was staunchly against it, as well as many in law enforcement), who saw inherent unfairness in placing the non-violent crime of drug trafficking on a par with murder. The laws also drew intense opposition from civil rights advocates, who claimed that they were racist, as they were applied inordinately to African-Americans, and to a lesser extent, Latinos.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Giuliani will say anything. He forgot the part about how Obama really wants to let all urban criminals go free but wants offenders from small-town America to serve mandatory life sentences. That's a joke, folks.<br></p>",
  "<p>Have you heard the old joke about what separates a hockey mom from a pitbull?</p> <p>Lipstick.</p> <p>And <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14805.html\">$150,000 worth of clothes, hair, and makeup</a>.</p> <p>Politico reports that the Republican National Committee \"has spent more than $150,000 to clothe and accessorise vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin and her family\" since August, with shopping bills at stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Barney's and Bloomingdale's totaling as much as $75,062.63, and a one-month hair and makeup total expenditure of $4,716.49.</p> <p>There is some question about the <a href=\"http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/a_legal_issue_with_palin_coutu.php\">legality</a> of such extravagant wardrobe expenditures under the Federal Election Commission's guidelines on the use of campaign contributions to procure personal items, although my completely proletarian opinion is that securing an appropriate wardrobe for a female candidate in particular is a necessary part of campaign branding. Given the truly preposterous amount of attention that has been given to Palin's <a href=\"http://cosmetic-makeovers.com/2008/09/06/sarah-palins-hair-how-to-video\">hair</a>, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2008-09-03-palin-glasses_N.htm\">glasses</a>, <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/-1,101508palinshoesg.photogallery?index=0\">shoes</a>, <a href=\"http://crooksandliars.com/logan-murphy/sarah-palin-wears-polar-bear-pin\">accessories</a> and every other little detail of her <a href=\"http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/fashion/article4659830.ece\">clothing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/30/is-sarah-palins-lipliner_n_130352.html\">makeup</a>, it's tough to argue that the campaign had no reason to invest in Palin's look. </p> <p>(Arguing that women shouldn't be subjected to such scrutiny is a whole other argument entirely.)</p> <p>The question isn't whether they should have spent any money. It's whether they should have spent what my grandmother used to describe as \"that kind of money.\"</p> <p>It certainly wasn't a necessity with regard to the availability of fashionable clothes for modest prices. As <a href=\"http://www.pamshouseblend.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=7697\">Pam Spaulding</a> aptly notes, \"Michelle Obama buys <a href=\"http://petite.about.com/b/2008/06/23/where-to-find-michelle-obamas-dress.htm\">off-the-rack</a> (eg, the dress that she wore on The View was $148), and looks damn good in it without costing the campaign a fortune.\"</p> <p>I can't imagine the campaign calculated it was a necessity with regard to their audience. The McCain-Palin campaign's governing principle is easily and succinctly pr\u00e9cised as \"What would Joe Six-pack do?\" One guesses he wouldn't spend a cool $150k at Bloomie's. Even if Joe Six-pack had that kind of money to spend these days, the small towns in \"Real America\" populated by Clans Six-pack and Plumber, about which Palin gushingly enthuses on the campaign trail, generally trend less toward Saks and more toward Marts: Wal and K to be precise.</p> <p>And so, predictably, the scheme has failed miserably with their base. <a href=\"http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/republicans_disgusted_by_rnc_s.php\">Marc Ambinder</a> reports, \"Republicans, RNC donors and at least one RNC staff member have e-mailed me tonight to share their utter (and not-for-attribution) disgust at the expenditures.\"</p> <p>Palin spokesperson Tracey Schmitt tried valiantly to <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/10/22/palin_outfits_cost_rnc_150k.html\">spin the complaints</a>: \"With all of the important issues facing the country right now, it's remarkable that we're spending time talking about pantsuits and blouses.\" The point, you have missed it.

  "<p>From the moment she appeared on the vice-presidential campaign stage, with her serious but sexy spectacles, that dramatically swept up hair and her working mom suits paired with surprisingly high heels, Sarah Palin has pitched her style perfectly, treading a tricky line between heartland mom and all-American bombshell that could not fail to appeal to her rightwing fans. </p> <p>Her favourite outfit of a boxy jacket paired with a notably tight skirt \u2013 almost always in black or red - exemplifies her image perfectly, and how she has used her femininity as an advantage whereas Hillary Clinton attempted to downplay it in unfortunately hued trouser suits.</p> <p>But all public images are hard to maintain on an international stage and it turns out that Palin's down-on-the-ranch look has been more high maintenance than the \"elite liberal east coast\" look modelled by Michelle Obama.</p> <p>Since early September, the Republican National Committee has spent over $150,000 dressing Palin and her family, buying clothes in department stores across the country, in both the \"pro-America areas\", to use Palin's description of Republican areas, and otherwise. </p> <p>According to financial disclosure records, there was a $75,062.63 shopping spree at Neiman Marcus in Minneapolis, Minnesota and $5,102.71 in New York, epicentre of the east coast liberal elites. About $4,716.49 was spent on hair and makeup in September, which rather puts into perspective former Democratic candidate John Edwards' $400 haircuts, which prompted much mocking from the Republicans. </p> <p>Despite all of her tub thumping that she is just like Joe Six Pack, Joe the Plumber and the ever popular \"American moms\", it is unlikely that any of the aforementioned have an apparently unlimited budget to spend on their wardrobes, particularly in the economic downturn.</p> <p>The Republicans have been trying to pitch themselves as the party for the heartland's hardworking man, when Cindy McCain appeared at the Republican National Convention, with an outfit that cost approximately $300,000. </p> <p>Michelle Obama, by contrast, was estimated to have spent $1,500 on the outfit she wore at the Democratic National Convention.</p> <p>It is likely, though, that McCain, a multimillionaire, and Obama spent their own money on their outfits, whereas money for Palin's makeover has come from the RNC's own funds, and some have questioned the legality about spending campaign money on items for Palin and her family's personal use. </p> <p>Spokeswoman Tracey Schmidt insisted that the clothing would \"go to a charitable purpose after the campaign\".</p> <p>Surely that will be hard to break to her children. One of the most enduring images from the Republican national convention will surely be a photo of Piper, her seven-year-old daughter, proudly clutching a Louis Vuitton handbag.</p>",
  "<p>So it turns out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-johnmccain-barackobama-debate-joe-the-plumber\">Joe the Plumber</a> isn't really a plumber, and his first name <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/joe-in-the-spotlight/\">isn't really Joe</a>, and his business <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14652.html\">doesn't really make anything close to $250,000 a year</a> and thus wouldn't experience any additional tax burden under Barack Obama's plan. But really, who cares? Joe the Plumber isn't the one running for office - yet! - and it's only mildly disgraceful that John McCain seems to be selling his entire economic policy on the rapidly deflating authority of a single Ohio fabulist. The real scandal is that Obama's exchange with Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher continues to haunt the Illinois senator. This would be the exchange in which Obama said the following: \"I think that when we spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody.\"</p> <p>Since Obama's tax plans have been public for months, it's slightly perplexing that this has suddenly become the greatest gaffe since <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/09/30/kerry.comment/\">John Kerry got into a chronological train wreck</a> to the tune of $87bn.

Upon taking an idle flip through the Arizona senator's tax plan, I can't help but notice that he offers continued support for something called the \"income tax\", which, in its current form, imposes a tax on earnings at marginal rates that start at 10% and extend up to 35%. I have my suspicions that this means some individuals will have a portion of their income taxed at 35% while other will have their income taxed at only 10%, if at all. This tax revenue will be redistributed in the form of government programmes, and I cannot shake the nagging feeling that this progressive redistribution will involve \"spreading\" the wealth.</p> <p>Of course, an alternate interpretation is that spreading the wealth is just another name for government as we know it, and that virtually every politician to the fiscal left of Ron Paul supports it in some form. Their reasons for support might vary. Some believe progressive taxation is justified by the fact that individuals receive diminishing marginal returns from each additional dollar they earn, and others argue that the wealthy should have a disproportionately large responsibility for maintaining the system that allowed them to accrue an immense number of dollars in the first place. Take your pick. But please, let's not kid ourselves into thinking that the choice between Obama and McCain is a choice between someone who's going to spread wealth and someone who's going to let it be.</p> <p>Even the Ron Pauls and Grover Norquists of the world support some kind of redistribution. Just about any form of flat tax, \"fair\" tax or value-added tax will also involve taking more money from some than from others, and redistributing that money through government services that we will each enjoy to varying degrees. Just about the only tax that would not involve spreading the wealth would be what's called a head tax: charging a fixed amount per person, irrespective of income. I do not know of a single politician that advocates the exclusive use of head taxes.</p> <p>There are big differences between progressive income taxation and a flat tax, but McCain and Obama are not separated by such differences. Their plans vary <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/obama/1031268,CST-NWS-tax30.article\">only in the degree to which they are progressive</a>. McCain's plan for progressive taxation involves extending elements of George Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts such that the top marginal income tax rate remains at 35%. Obama advocates letting the tax cut for the top bracket expire, which will raise the rate to 39.6%. (For comparison, the top marginal rate under Republican president Dwight Eisenhower was above 90%.)</p> <p>The difference between 39.6% and 35% is important, but it requires a special brand of hypocrisy for McCain to pretend, as he has repeatedly over the past few days, that it's the kind of difference that makes Obama a \"socialist\". Before voting against the Bush tax cuts in May of 2001 - one of the tax cuts he now hopes to extend - McCain said that he \"cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us, at the expense of middle-class Americans who most need tax relief.\" And as recently as 2003 McCain was telling Katie Couric that \"low- and middle-income Americans are paying a significantly larger amount of their income in taxes\" than they had historically and that he would \"like to see them get the bulk\" of any future tax relief.</p> <p>Palin's Alaska, meanwhile, has more taxes per resident, more spending per resident and enjoys more federal dollars per resident than any other state in the country. As if that weren't enough, Alaska also has so many taxes on oil that each resident gets a $2,000 cheque from the state each year, which Palin recently bumped up to $3,200. Palin once <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/09/22/080922fa_fact_gourevitch?currentPage=2\">explained</a> this preposterous boondoggle by noting that \"unlike other states in the union\" Alaska was a place \"where it's collectively Alaskans own the resources [sic]. So we share in the wealth when the development of these resources occurs.\"</p> <p>Excuse me, \"share in the wealth\"? By her own standard, Palin is a socialist! When McCain repeats his lines about socialism it's annoying, but when Palin does it, it's actually kind of funny. As the governor once said, the first time it's tragedy, the second time it's farce. Or maybe that was someone else.</p>",
  "<p>President Bush and fellow world leaders will attempt to thrash out a united response to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">the global financial crisis</a> next month when Washington hosts an emergency summit.</p> <p>The meeting on November 15 will discuss the underlying causes of the downturn, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/globaleconomy\">the global response</a> and the principles that will underpin any reforms, the White House said today. Leaders from the group of leading economies - including Brazil, China and India as well as the G7 nations such as the UK and Japan- will attend the meeting, which will also seek input from the winner of the US presidential election.</p> <p>However, the White House acknowledged that the first meeting was unlikely to produce a series of concrete proposals for tackling the consequences of the credit crunch. </p> <p>Although the world's biggest economies have followed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">Gordon Brown's lead in recapitalising their leading banks</a>, leaders have expressed divergent views on what future shape global finance should take. Bush has warned that any coordinated international action should preserve free markets but his French counterpart, Nicolas Sarkozy, declared last month that the \"all powerful market that always knows best is dead\".</p> <p>Dana Perino, a White House spokesman, said she did not expect the summit to present firm decisions on new policy or regulation. The task of putting \"meat on the bones\" after the meeting will be up to financial experts in the world leaders' respective countries, Perino added. \"A lot of work will have to be done at the task force level, the working group level,\" she said. Those working groups will then draft recommendations for consideration at further summits.</p> <p>Barack Obama, favourite to win the presidential election that takes place 11 days before the summit, welcomed the announcement by the Bush administration that it was making one last push to stabilise the global economy before the new White House incumbent takes office on January 20. </p> <p>\"I am happy today that the White House announced a summit that provides an opportunity to advance the kind of cooperation I called for last month. America must lead and other nations must be part of the solution too,\" said Obama.</p>",
  "<p>Another hilarious bit from the Embarracuda, <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/10/21/palin-vp-senate/\">via Think Progress</a>, wherein she says that the vice president is \"in charge of the U.S. Senate\":</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l40nrw3V3GA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/l40nrw3V3GA&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/l40nrw3V3GA&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p><br>For the record, the source of her confusion is this. The Constitution calls the vice-president the presiding officer of the Senate, but the veep casts a vote there only in the event of a tie. Other than that, the vice-president actually presides over the Senate only on ceremonial occasions.</p> <p>But here's the thing. As ThinkProg notes, she made the same mistake back in July. One of two explanations is possible: 1, she's a real ignoramus who can't retain a piece of rather relevant information for three months, or 2, the McCain people haven't really bothered to try very hard to make sure she learns this stuff.</p> <p>I choose 2. And along these lines, Lauren Wessler, my colleague her in the Washington office, makes a very perceptive point. Could it be that Palin is the victim of some kind of internal subterfuge within the McCain campaign? That is to say, assuming her ticket loses, she's clearly preparing to run for president in 2012 and would have a lot of support. It's not a stretch to think that some people in the McCain camp, horrified that he picked her, are also thinking ahead to 2012 -- political operatives, after all, tend to go from campaign to campaign -- and they don't want her anywhere near their party's nomination. So, convinced now that this election is probably lost, they're letting her make an ass of herself in order to further discredit her for the future.<br></p>",
  "<p>Until recently, no one thought of John McCain as a culture warrior. Distrusted by the religious right, he seemed annoyed even to have to address issues like gay marriage. In February, a political lifetime ago, a poll commissioned by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund found sizeable support for McCain among pro-choice women, and revealed that seven in 10 of these women <a href=\"http://www.ppvw.org/pressReleases/PPAF_poll.pdf\">didn't know the candidate's actual anti-abortion views</a> (pdf). By many accounts, his first choice for a running mate was the pro-choice Independent Joe Lieberman. As recently as May, he told Glamour Magazine that he would encourage the Republican party to <a href=\"http://www.glamour.com/magazine/2008/08/mccain-interview?currentPage=4\">include exemptions to the anti-abortion plank of its platform</a> for cases of rape, incest and threats to the mother's life.</p> <p>How odd, then, that in these final weeks, McCain's rhetoric on women has reached a pitch of febrile wingnuttery not heard from a presidential candidate in decades. The first clues came with the Sarah Palin pick, as well as with his ultimate failure to even try to moderate the party platform's abortion language, which emerged as absolutist as ever. Both those things, though, could have been taken as more evidence of disinterest toward women's issues, rather than active extremism. Not so his recent fulminations. </p> <p>First there was the final presidential debate, where McCain attacked Obama for his insistence that any ban on late-term abortions have an exception when a woman's health is at risk. Using sarcastic air quotes, McCain treated such concerns as risible, saying: \"That's the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, 'health'.\" He used the phrase \"pro-abortion\", a locution favoured by the hard right, three times, and clearly stated his desire to see Roe v Wade overturned.</p> <p>Then, speaking on Fox News on Sunday, McCain celebrated Palin as <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/19/campaign.wrap/index.html\">\"a direct counterpoint to the liberal feminist agenda for America\"</a> who has a \"wonderful family\". (The implication, perhaps, being that feminists do not have wonderful families, which someone should tell to <a href=\"http://www.grandmagazine.com/article.asp?id=92\">grandmother-of-six</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi\">Nancy Pelosi</a>, among many, many others). </p> <p>To some observers, this might all this might seem quite standard. There's nothing new, after all, about the Republican party opposing abortion or lambasting feminism. In recent elections, however, GOP presidential candidates have generally tried to soften their message for mass consumption. In 1992, after George HW Bush lost to Bill Clinton, the chastened Republican party vowed to remake their image as angry plutocratic puritans. Reporting on the 1992 meeting of the Republican Governor's Association, held just after the election, the New York Times described a party <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7D91439F934A25752C1A964958260\">desperate to start promoting an image of \"diversity\" and \"tolerance\"</a>. It quoted Haley Barbour, currently the governor of Mississippi, saying: \"We need our heads examined if we let abortion be the threshold issue of Republicanism.\" </p> <p>To be sure, Republicans since then haven't changed their position on reproductive rights. They have, however, changed their language. In 1996, Bob Dole tried to reach out to pro-choice voters and infuriated the right by <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E5DB1E31F93AA25753C1A960958260\">failing to bring up late-term abortion</a> while debating Clinton. Even the resolutely anti-abortion George W Bush mostly signalled his position with <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2108083/\">allusions and dog-whistles</a> heard only by the already committed. Rather than declare his desire to see Roe v Wade swept away, he spoke of <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2004/oct/13/nation/na-dred13\">his opposition to the US supreme court's infamous pro-slavery Dred Scott decision</a>, baffling those who didn't know that in the anti-abortion movement, <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/doc/20041101/pollitt\">Dred Scott is constantly invoked as a Roe analogy</a>. </p> <p>Republicans even stopped bashing the women's movement, trying instead to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/26/uselections2008.hillaryclinton\">co-opt it</a>. Hence all the recent crowing that Palin, presented as half Arctic Annie Oakley, half supermom, represents real, you-can-have-it-all feminism, the kind that might even appeal to disaffected Hillary Clinton supporters. </p> <p>But now, losing, frustrated and discombobulated, McCain has dropped the pretence. The surprise is not his contempt for feminism, but his willingness to express it so baldly. Ironically, it's precisely the fact that he hasn't spent his career in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_Gantry\">Elmer Gantry</a> wing of the party that now makes him sound so unhinged. He's not fluent in the codes and dodges more practiced Republicans use to lull moderates while signalling their faith to the true believers. As a spokesman for reaction, he's unvarnished. His blunt anti-feminism is slightly shocking, but, given the party he's now leading, at least it's honest.</p>",
  "<p><strong>BECK HOME (NEARLY)</strong></p> <p>The Designated Player Rule in Major League Soccerball allows every franchise to sign one player whose personal terms are not affected by the league's salary cap regulations.

Will you look at the state of their squad! The spine of the team - club captain Paolo Maldini, star striker Gianni Rivera and Brazilian goalkeeper Moacyr Barbosa - are all getting on a bit.

Of course this move, to be effected on January 1, doesn't mean Beckham is no longer an object of extreme irony.

Yes, the G14-driven Big Cup is a fact of modern life, but then so are Tim Lovejoy, The Buk Wot Tim Lovejoy Rote, and the tragic ostracism of the comma. It doesn't make them right, and a six-strikes-and-you're-still-not-necessarily-out makes for the sort of preamble even a rambling tea-time email would baulk at. Contrast that with, for example, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Cup_1978-79\">1978-79 European Cup</a>, when due to an unseeded knockout draw the champions of Europe, Liverpool, were put out of Europe even before Seasonal Affective Disorder had kicked in, by the champions of England, Nottingham Forest.</p> <p>The most relevant imponderable of the night probably relates to whether Atletico Madrid fans will boo Liverpool's black players. \"There is no problem with r@cism in Spain,\" said Liverpool's Spanish keeper Jose Reina. \"Spain is not a r@cist country and Madrid is not a r@cist city,\" he added, burying his head so far in the sand that he inadvertently made the most significant archaeological discovery of the 21st century. Still, everything's OK because, in between burying their head in small plates of recycled sausage meat, Uefa's suits have reportedly given the referee Claus Bo Larsen licence to call off the game if he hears any racial abuse.

Visually and emotionally unsettling, it's a highly original piece (with a nod to Hogarth) that is strictly adult fare.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.ifc.com/video/Web-Series/Young-American-Bodies/1529447711\">Young American Bodies: Episode One</a></h2> <p>Despite being the brainchild of Joe \"Hannah Takes The Stairs\" Swanberg, this hugely popular angst-and-sex indie soap opera is as much soft-core as mumblecore, with plenty of full-frontal frolics on show. Yet its thoughtful cinema-verite style, faithfully tracking the awkward real-time conversations and knotty romances of a flat full of Chicago twentysomethings, elevates it way above the web's current rush of \"naked co-ed\" drama series. Keeping the performances as real as the characters' dilemmas, Swanberg directs, writes and stars as geeky, lovelorn Ben, crankily in love with the neurotically promiscuous Maggie in this opening series. Cybercinema is currently hopelessly in thrall to its quirky Cassavetes-lite style, dawdling pace, and awkward couplings, and so will you be.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.depict.org/shortlists/232\">DepicT: Happy Families \u2013 Mr Peep The Womanizer</a></h2> <p>Even the busiest office drone amongst you can spare a lunchtime to fossick through the 90-second wonders in DepicT 2008's short film competition. Suck 'em and see, and vote online to crown your favourite in the Encounters short film festival in Bristol on November 22. They are all pretty tasty, but we are championing Mole Hill's eccentric rhyming take on the well-loved Victorian card game, whose charming but cruel story of how a peeping tom's eyes run away with him is executed in a wonderful, wobbly parody of the original John Jaques illustrations. And if you haven't already seen No-One Is Illegal, George Sander Jackson's fluid, haunting animation of a Malawian asylum seeker's agonising trip through the system, make sure to remedy this oversight immediately. </p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.funlittlemovies.com/turbodates.html\">Turbo Dates: Men Are From Mars</a></h2> <p>Wading through the high-profile comedy sites that have launched recently, Cybercinema has been almost invariably disappointed. FunnyOrDie UK has been, well, deathly, to date, and so far Seth McFarlane's Comedy Cavalcades are one-gag wonders from the guy behind The Family Guy. So we were happy to fall over this tucked-away test site for a series of uniformly sleek and witty playlets spoofing speed dating, created by Pirates of the Caribbean scribe Terry Rossio with Jocelyn Stamat. This time around, Courteney can't figure out the oddly robotic Brad, who claims to have come from a far galaxy for mating purposes (\"Let us trade secretions. The Federation allows your roommate to join us!\"). Is he a nerdy social misfit trying to weasel a threesome, or can she really save humankind with a hook-up? </p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/relevance/search/IN%C3%81CIO/video/x1h4j3_tarantinos-mind?from=rss\">Tarantino's Mind</a></h2> <p>To celebrate production commencing on Inglorious Bastards, we've been brushing up our Tarantino trivia with this chic, well-crafted two-hander. Brazilian directing duo 300ml make very canny use of clips (and City of God star Seu Jorge) to create a unified field of conspiracy theory for Tarantino's movies, as a pair of fanboys engage in heated debate in a Rio diner as to whether his movies are actually one giant epic, divided into several episodes. Reflect on whether The Bride and Mia Wallace are actually the same person, if that famous Pulp Fiction twinkling briefcase contains the Reservoir Dog diamonds, why Roger Federer and Tarantino are never seen together, and make your own mind up. Don't overlook the supremely elegant paper structure listing Tarantino's recurrent obsessions that constructs itself under the opening credits, or we will have to get medieval on your ass.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.atom.com/funny_videos/president_bear_1/\">President Bear: Episode 1</a> and <a href=\"http://www.atom.com/funny_videos/president_bear_2/\">Episode 2</a></h2> <p>Oprah may be backing Obama, and Sylvester Stallone endorsing McCain, but this month Cybercinema is rooting for President \"Grizzly\" Anderson, star of Atom's comic spoof. After a medical emergency demands that his brain be transplanted into a bear (\"They're stern yet cuddly, and native to America\") the president finds his approval ratings way down. Can he conquer his urge to eat the White House press corps, and maul his ambitious vice-president like a lost hiker? Or will those prank calls on the hotline phone about \"lost pic-er-nic baskets in Jellystone Park\" get him roaring at the Russians? Either way, he's got our vote.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>'s selection of Alaska governor <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> to be his vice presidential running mate has thrust her state onto the world stage to an unprecedented degree. So far this situation has done little but tarnish Alaska's image. Palin's far-right politics, oppressive religious views, and dubious history have led many people to view Alaska as a corrupt, reactionary backwater. This is unfortunate - for in reality the state is a fascinating mix of European and Native American traditions, which exist in one of the most amazing environmental contexts imaginable. Fortunately there are many counterpoints that can be offered to Palin's Alaska. A particularly effective one is the state's former <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/poetry\">poet</a> laureate John Haines.</p> <p>Born in Norfolk, Virginia, the now octogenarian Haines, who currently resides in Montana, made Alaska his home for decades. Though he would later become a teacher, during his early years in the state Haines lived in classic frontiersman fashion, working as fur trapper in the region's remote interior. It was an experience that has deeply informed his work, which, as befitting a poet of such a vast, cold, and thinly populated land, is darkly introspective and often demanding. Haines's vision of Alaska is perhaps best exemplified in his early poems, such as The Hermitage, which chronicles the intense aloneness a person can feel in such an environment:</p> <p>I own a crevice stuffed with moss<br>and a couch of lemming fur;<br>I sit and listen to the music<br>of water dripping on a distant stone.<br>Or I sing to myself <br>of stealth and loneliness</p> <p>No one comes to see me<br>but I hear outside<br>the scratching of claws,<br>the warm, inquisitive breath \u2026</p> <p>Another excellent example along these lines is this excerpt from the visceral hunting piece Divided, the Man Dreaming:</p> <p>One half<br>lives in sunlight; he is<br>the hunter and calls<br>the beasts of the field<br>about him.<br>Bathed in sweat and tumult<br>he slakes and kills<br>eats meat<br>and knows blood</p> <p>As important as Haines's Alaska-based work is, he is far from a 'regional' poet. Though deeply based in these northern latitudes, he has traveled extensively (including a teaching stint in the UK) and studied widely - and his poetry often reflects this, with many locales coming into play and the subject matter of moose and snowdrifts often giving way to discussions of contemporary art and more free-floating metaphysics. In addition to his work as a poet, Haines is also an essayist of considerable worth, who often uses this medium to express a more overtly environmentalist philosophy.</p> <p>Haines has never been prolific as a writer and most of his poetry books are out of print and hard to come by. However, an excellent volume called <a href=\"http://www.graywolfpress.org/Related_Content/Book_Excerpts/Excerpt_from_The_Owl_in_the_Mask_of_the_Dreamer/\">The Owl in the Mask of the Dreamer</a>, which collects his works up to 1996, is widely available and highly recommended. A number of his essay collections are more readily found, though, with perhaps the best, or at least most representational in regards to his time in Alaska, being <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stars-Snow-Fire-John-Haines/dp/155597306X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1224685721&amp;sr=8-1\">The Stars, the Snow, the Fire</a>, which collects works from the late 1970s up to the year 2000.</p> <p>Though a very readable writer, Haines's vision is often a tough one based on solitude and the difficult realities of life in a harsh, though beautiful landscape. However, for those disgusted with or just confused about Alaska because of the sudden rise of Sarah Palin, it might just be the perfect antidote for such feelings. In my opinion, the politics of the current Alaska governor represent the worst instincts of my home country. The poetry and essays of John Haines, on the other hand, embodies some of our most worthwhile traits. It also gives a deeper, and I would argue, more truthful portrait of America's 49th state.</p>",

Note the expert way he attempts to rescue himself from the error by repeating some of the same words in a different combination in the hope that something will stick -- a rhetorical technique plainly borrowed from Sarah Palin.

  "<p>While John McCain has attacked the liberal US community group Acorn for alleged voter registration fraud, the Republican party continues to employ operatives facing fraud accusations including one who faces criminal perjury charges.</p> <p>Democrats are accusing McCain of hypocrisy after the weekend arrest of Mark Jacoby, a California Republican operative. Jacoby has been accused of voter registration fraud after registering himself to vote at two homes where he did not live.</p> <p>The arrest comes after McCain and running mate Sarah Palin attempted to tie Barack Obama's campaign to Acorn, playing up a federal investigation of the group's voter registration tactics in several states. </p> <p>\"Over the past few weeks we've heard John McCain denounce voter fraud on the campaign trail while the [Republican party] hurls false attacks, so the question is: where is the outrage now?\" Democratic spokesman Karen Finney asked yesterday.</p> <p>Jacoby is the second Republican operative revealed this week to possess a questionable record on voter registration. Nathan Sproul \u2013 who has been investigated by Congress for allegedly destroying voter registration forms and intimidating voters \u2013 got paid $175,000 by the McCain camp this year.</p> <p>\"The Republicans [and] the McCain campaign have been hammering away for weeks with the same old Washington politics,\" Democratic party lawyer Joe Sandler said in a statement. </p> <p>\"In fact, none of the charges that they've been talking about have actually panned out.\" </p> <p>Democrats called on McCain to cut his ties to both voter-registration operatives, citing frequent Republican attacks on Acorn. Obama represented Acorn as an attorney years before beginning his political career, and the group has endorsed him this year, but his camp has denied any link to Acorn's voter-registration activities.</p> <p>The California Republican party told a local newspaper yesterday that their contract with Jacoby ended this week, after the state's voter registration period expired. No announcement has been made about the renewal of the contract.</p>",
  "<p>After being treated as political kryptonite and depicted as enraged Orcs for the past seven years, Muslims and Arabs \u2013 the media's modern day Morlocks \u2013 temporarily emerged as human beings thanks to Colin Powell's Obama endorsement on Sunday.</p> <p>The former US secretary of state partially redeemed his tarnished legacy by <a href=\" http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27265369/\">asking</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>What if [Obama] is [a Muslim]?

Is there something wrong with some seven-year-old Muslim-American kid believing he or she can be president?</p> <p>Yet I have heard senior members of my own party drop the suggestion: he's a Muslim, and he might be associated with terrorists. This is not the way we should be doing it in America.</p> </blockquote> <p>Unfortunately, according to an increasingly vocal, racist and Islamophobic minority, which has been shamefully aided over the years by the inexcusable silence of a complicit mainstream media, there is something fundamentally \"un-American\" about wearing the contemporary Scarlet Letter: Muslim.</p> <p>The October surprise unleashed by a desperate Republican campaign \u2013 spearheaded by mavericks John McCain and Sarah Palin \u2013 reeks from the stench of a modern day, fear-mongering McCarthyism - replacing Communism with Islam.</p> <p>Obama, that biracial, African American son of a Kenyan with an Arab name, is apparently now a \"Socialist with Islamic background\" according to anti-Muslim McCain supporters at a now <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_SKyKOih7k\"> infamous McCain Virginia rally</a>. When asked to prove such an audacious claim, the rabble rouser replied: \"Well, he was raised in a madrassa [an Indonesian elementary school] \u2026there's a lot of background ... I can't do that [intelligently explain my ignorant prejudice] right now.\"</p> <p>Perhaps he received his cues from McCain and Governor Palin. Although Colin Powell swears McCain is no racist, the media conveniently forgets his obscene and unapologetic 2000 statement: \"I hate the Gooks. I will hate them as long as I live.\" Thankfully, the Vietnamese Americans at <a href=\"http://mccainhatesgooks.com/mchg/\"> McCainHatesGooks.com</a> have not. </p> <p>Therefore, is it truly surprising that McCain's running mate, Troopergate Palin, recently cast doubt on Obama's \"past\" due to his associations with Reverend Wright, his \"terrorist pal\" William Ayers, and <a href=\" http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/20/campaign.wrap/\">most recently in a speech</a> where she compared Obama to a socialist: \"Barack Obama calls it spreading the wealth \u2026 But Joe the Plumber and Ed the Dairy Man, I believe that they think that it sounds more like socialism.\" </p> <p>According to Sarah the Moose Hunter and her acolytes, such as <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/1008/Limbaugh_Where_are_the_inexperienced_white_liberals_Powell_has_endorsed.html?showall\">Rush the Blowhard</a> and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/16/stephen-baldwin-obama-a-c_n_135394.html\">Stephen the Untalented Baldwin</a>, Obama's Arabic name and non-existent Islamic roots emit threatening \"un-American\" and \"terrorist-y\" vibes.</p> <p>In contrast, however, Powell's surprisingly tolerant words, which he should have uttered in 2003 in lieu of his shameful UN security council \"anthrax in a vial\" speech, reflect a growing Republican self-awareness of previously unchecked \"smear by Muslim association\" rhetoric. In fact, at the <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl2EndLZv7w\">same Virginia McCain rally</a>, several Conservative Christian and Muslim McCain voters chastised the \"Obama is a Muslim\" inciter as racist and unrepresentative of their beliefs.</p> <p>One wonders what took an influential American personality, such as Powell, so long to make such elementary and rational statements regarding Muslim and Arab Americans. <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/13/campbell.brown.obama/\">CNN's Campbell Brown</a> should be commended as being one of the first vocal members of the mainstream media to ask, \"Even if Obama is a Muslim \u2013 so what?\" Even actor Ben Affleck deserves applause for reminding the world on Real Time with Bill Maher that \"Arab and 'good person' are not antithetical to one another.\" </p> <p>The next evolutionary step, of course, will be \"He's Muslim \u2013 not that there's anything wrong with that.\" Followed, hopefully, by \"Why, some of my best friends are Muslim!\"</p> <p>Eventually, it will culminate with a blindingly obvious realisation that indeed Muslims \u2013 like every other group \u2013 are patriotic American citizens, just like the 20-year-old specialist <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/2008/09/29/slideshow_080929_platon?slide=16\">Kareem Rashad Sultan Khan</a> mentioned in Powell's speech. Sultan, a Muslim American native of Manahawkin, New Jersey, and the recipient of the prestigious Purple Heart and Bronze Star, now rests in Arlington Cemetery after giving his life to protect and serve his country in Iraq.</p> <p>Shahed Amanullah, the editor of Altmuslim.com, <a href=\" http://blog.beliefnet.com/progressiverevival/2008/10/crescents-among-the-crosses.html \">reminds us</a> that \"according to the American Muslim armed forces and veterans affairs council, there are currently 20,000 Muslims serving with honor in the US military.\" </p> <p>Furthermore, it warrants mentioning that in 2007, the Washington DC Muslim community honored the Muslim American Veteran's Association, which was represented by Muslim soldiers who bravely fought for the US alongside their fellow American soldiers in the second world war.</p> <p>Yet, these sobering reminders of our communality are constantly drowned in a sea of divisive hate speech. Surprisingly, no one has asked: \"What do Muslim, African and Arab countries think of the anti-Obama smear campaign?\" After all, if McCain wins a major reason will be due to his campaign's use of racist and prejudicial fear mongering, as evidenced by the recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/20/obama-mccain-election-ohio-carolina\">McCain-endorsed robocalls</a>. </p> <p>What does this rhetoric say about America, and what signal does that send to the rest of the world? In the 21st century, is the self-proclaimed beacon of democracy and defender of liberties comprised of a hypocritical and ignorant voting populace so terrified of a \"minority\" that we vote for the alternative simply due to his \"whiteness,\" which inherently affirms his professed \"American-ness?\" If indeed McCain is a maverick, reformer and a \"uniter\" unlike George Bush, how will he explain his campaign rhetoric and smearing tactics to Muslim allies, such as Pakistan, Iraq and Afghanistan, as we combine efforts on the \"War on Terror?\" Due to this overwhelming hysteria, are we shocked to learn that according to a comprehensive world Gallup poll - highlighted in the inestimable <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/press/17473/gallup-press.aspx\">Who Speaks for Islam? What a Billion Muslims Really Think</a> - when Americans were asked, \"What do you admire about Muslims?\" a majority answered, \"I don't know\" or \"Nothing.\"</p> <p>When the US had the honour of hosting the 1996 Olympics, the pantheon of athletic talent and sportsmanship, Americans reflected a different mentality. The motto of the Olympic Games is as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sadly, the Republicans have lost sight of this sentiment. However, in Atlanta 12 years ago the US - which includes Republicans, Democrats and independents - took pride in bestowing the honour of lighting the Olympic flame to a national symbol of strength and defiance. He has an Arab name. He is Muhammad Ali. </p> <p>He is an American. And a Muslim.</p>",

With no phone and no car, he would be the first to admit he doesn't own much. </p> <p>But what little he does have, he nearly lost earlier this year after he fell of a ladder while he was painting and went to the local hospital to get a herniated disc treated. Crimmins was left with a $5,000 bill; he earns $15,000. </p> <p>When he was taken to court for the money, he didn't bother showing up. \"I didn't see the point,\" he says. \"They're going to do whatever they want anyhow.\" </p> <p>So Carilion, a nonprofit private clinic that gets tax breaks in return for a commitment to provide healthcare to the poor, garnished his wages. They are also garnishing his sister's wages for money she owes them and extracting money from his mother's pay packet for care she received. \"Carilion have been trying to take me to court since I was 18,\" says Crimmins. </p> <p>Indeed, since 2003 Carilion has accounted for 40% of all the judgments at Roanoke district court. Such is the volume of its collections that the courts set aside one day a week just to deal with healthcare. They call it Carilion day.</p> <p>\"While the numbers seem large, they represent a small fraction of the 2 million patient visits to Carilion facilities each year,\" says Eric Earnhart, a spokesman for Carilion.\"</p> <p>\"But we are working hard to reduce the number of people who qualify for charity care but do not pursue it. Last year we provided approximately $43m in free care to patients who couldn't afford to pay.\"</p> <p>A local group, the Citizens Coalition for Responsible Healthcare, has been set up to challenge Carilion and raise the issue of affordable healthcare in the town.</p> <p>Ken King, the coalition president, says that if you cannot afford health insurance, \"your doctor of choice becomes the emergency room\". </p> <p>\"At that point you are probably walking into a room that has the highest cost of operation of any medical facility, any kind of care available ... If you can't pay it, you get sued. Thirty-three thousand people in Roanoke general district court in the last five years have been sued for that bill.\"</p> <p>Once a railroad town, Roanoke is now dominated by Carilion, which merged with another local hospital in the late 1980s. At the time, the justice department tried and failed to prevent the merger, warning that it would create a monopoly. </p> <p>According to the Wall Street Journal, health insurance rates in the area have risen since then from the lowest to the highest in Virginia. </p> <p>Carilion disputes this: \"A comparison of Carilion's prices with hospitals that have comparable volume, and with the state average, shows that in many if not most cases, our prices are lower,\" it says. </p> <p>Today, a colonoscopy at Carilion costs between four and 10 times what you would pay at a local endoscopy centre, while a neck CT scan is just under three times as much. Hospital care, Carilion says, is always more expensive than that provided at outpatient facilities.</p> <p>The hospital has a charity care programme through which anyone who earns twice the federal poverty level or less should pay less, or nothing. A single person earning less than $20,800 or a family of four with an income below $42,400 should qualify. Clearly, however, many fall between the cracks.<br>So Crimmins, it turned out, was eligible for assistance, and Carilion has stopped pursuing him. </p> <p>Healthcare has emerged as a huge issue in this election. With the provision of care here often tied to jobs, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/useconomy\">failing economy</a> means anyone worried about their job security is, almost by definition, worried about their health. </p> <p>And this isn't just a concern for the very poor. One small business owner and cancer survivor I spoke to says she has not been for her check-ups for three years because she has no health insurance. She simply makes it a priority not to get sick. </p> <p>With 16% of the country uninsured, and 50% of bankruptcies linked to non-payment of medical bills, the issue is central to the economy.</p> <p>The numbers are staggering. \"Forty-seven million [people] - which is 35% of the population - don't have healthcare insurance in the United States right now,\" says King. \"$143bn is the administrative cost of the healthcare system, and that's simply the paperwork cost; $2tn is the annual healthcare cost in the United States ... and $7,000 per person is what it costs us. </p> <p>\"One of the things that is really a problem is that employers are beginning to say: 'We can no longer do this. We can't provide healthcare for you as an employee.' And that number is going to go way up.\"</p> <p>For the most part, that is good news for the Democratic presidential nominee, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>, who is regarded as better on health than his Republican rival, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>. </p> <p>\"Me, personally, I think I would put a poor man in, somebody who knows how to budget, knows how it feels to struggle,\" Crimmins says. \"[I've worked] pretty much since I was 12 years old. My mom, she was raising nine of us by herself, so she didn't have the money to get what we wanted - or what we needed, most of the time. So I always had to pitch in and help out.\"</p> <p>He has never voted, and he is not registered. But he is rooting for McCain because, he says, the Republican is more experienced. </p> <p>If she were registered, his partner, Melissa Hicks, would vote the same way. \"I don't know why I don't like Obama,\" she says. \"But it's not because he's black.\"</p>",

John McCain is the better choice because he is more likely to continue the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> <p>\"This requires presence of an impetuous American leader such as McCain, who pledged to continue the war till the last American soldier,\" the message said. \"Then, al-Qaida will have to support McCain in the coming elections so that he continues the failing march of his predecessor, Bush.\"</p> <p>SITE Intelligence Group, based in Bethesda, Md., monitors the Web site and translated the message.</p> <p>\"If al-Qaida carries out a big operation against American interests,\" the message said, \"this act will be support of McCain because it will push the Americans deliberately to vote for McCain so that he takes revenge for them against al-Qaida. Al-Qaida then will succeed in exhausting America till its last year in it.\"</p> <p>Mark Salter, a senior McCain adviser, said he had heard about the Web site chatter but had no immediate comment.</p> </blockquote> <p>Once again, it's hypothetical comparative morning: Suppose an al-Qaida Web site had just issued such a statement about Obama...</p> <p>It should be obvious to anyone that a war-making Republican American administration is al-Qaida's best recruiting tool.

  "<p>If the saying that an hour is a long time in politics is true, then news that Barack Obama had cancelled rallies in the Midwest to visit his sick grandmother in Hawaii should have given John McCain some serious time to try to inflict damage on his Democratic opponent.</p> <p>Not so it seems. Suzanne Goldenberg writes in today's Guardian that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/22/uselections2008-johnmccain-colorado-barackobama\">McCain has \"given up\" on Colorado</a>, just a day after a campaign blitz in the battleground state by his running mate, Sarah Palin. ABC also reported yesterday that McCain was scaling back advertising in New Hampshire and Wisconsin where Obama is widening his lead and downgrading resources in Iowa - where Obama has cancelled rallies - and New Mexico. </p> <p>The \"fundraising juggernaut,\" that is the Obama campaign has a seemingly endless pot to dip into if newly released campaign figures are to believed. The $150m Obama raised in September represents only a part of the financial advantage he has amassed, says the Washington Post. </p> <p>He and the Democratic party committees supporting his campaign have $164m remaining in their collective accounts. Only a quarter of the $600m Obama has raised so far has come from small donations of $200 or less. Rich donors who have reached donation limits can contribute more through a Committee for Change.</p> <p>\"We kept running into donors who had maxed out to Obama Victory who wanted to do additional money and had the capacity to do it and were eager to do it,\" says Alan Kessler, a Philadelphia lawyer and fundraiser for the committee. Full steam ahead.</p> <p>Obama may not have to worry about his dollar count, but his vote count may be a different matter. With voting already underway, the machinery that derailed the 2000 election is causing anxiety. A \"perfect storm\", as Ewen MacAskill writes in today's Guardian, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/22/uselections2008\">building in time for election day</a> on November 4. A combination of sky-high voter interest, new ballot machines and a shortage of poll staff could see another debacle. Remember Florida? Virginia is stepping up security at polling booths on November 4 for fear of unrest from angry people in queues and those unable to vote. Thousands of lawyers, yes lawyers - it is the US after all - are being recruited by Obama and McCain to police polling booths.</p> <p>The 12 states that could have problems on election day, according to a report by the Pew group, are Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado, Virginia and Washington DC. </p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama will be in Virginia and Indiana on Wednesday and Thursday before heading to Hawaii until Saturday. He has cancelled rallies in Madison, Wisconsin and Des Moines, Iowa. McCain returns to New Hampshire then on to two rallies in Ohio with his running mate, Sarah Palin.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>According to the Pew Research Centre, Obama leads 52% against McCain's 38% - his widest margin yet. The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News sounding has him opening a 10-point lead over his Republican opponent, while the averages worked out by <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com\">realclearpolitics.com</a> has him on 50.2% to McCain's 43% - a 7.2-point lead. </p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/21/uselections2008-barackobama\">Tomasky talk: Obama's grandmother</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/21/virginia-uselections2008\">Video: Younge America - who wants to be a Carilionaire?</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/22/uselections2008-newmexico\">Video: Road trip, day 10: Frontier politics in Albuquerque</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/22/uselections2008-michelleobama-cindymccain\">First ladies: Michelle and Cindy square up</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/22/obama-mccain-kerry-clinton\">Jonathan Freedland: Obama hasn't won it yet</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/22/uselections2008\">Ballot debacle predicted for November 4</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/22/palin-clothes-spending-ha_n_136740.html\">Huffington Post: Palin's $150K fashion shopping spree</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2008/10/rat_meet_sinking_ship.html\">Mother Jones: Rat, meet sinking ship</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/21/AR2008102102255.html\">Washington Post: Michael Gerson - The irony of Obama</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blogs/edcut/374010\">The Nation: Voter registration flashpoints</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/opinion/22dowd.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin\">New York Times: Maureen Dowd - What moved Colin Powell</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://voices.kansascity.com/node/2493\">Midwest voices: Shame on McCain and Palin for using an old code word for black</a></p> <h2>Quotes of the day</h2> <p>\u2022 On revelations that the Republican National Committee spent more than $150,000 on clothing and make-up for Sarah Palin: \"With all of the important issues facing the country right now, it's remarkable that we're spending time talking about pantsuits and blouses\" - Republican spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt</p> <p>\u2022 \"It shows that Palin ain't like the rest of us ... the plumber's wife doesn't go to Nieman's or Saks\" - Democratic strategist Tom Matzzie</p>",

  "<p>To coincide with the fourth anniversary of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/johnpeel\">John Peel</a>'s death, the late broadcaster has had a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/21/john-peel-train\">train named after him</a>. It will start running on Thursday in Merseyside, not long after a collection of his writings, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/12/john-peel-madonna-fall\">The Olivetti Chronicles</a>, had been published by Bantam Press, joining at least three other Peel-related books. </p> <p>This is the latest line in Peel-related memorabilia that has sprung up since the his death in 2004. Since then, there has been a flood of material released in his honour, including the posthumous autobiography Margrave of the Marshes as well as biographies by Michael Heatley and Mick Wall. There's a play, Teenage Kicks, telling the DJ's life story. The online John Peel Archive Movement collects his radio shows as if they were treasures of antiquity. NME hands out the John Peel Award for Musical Innovation. There is the John Peel stage at Glastonbury festival. And the man was voted 43rd in the list of 100 Greatest Britons. </p> <p>In the years following his death, the Peel's life has also been commemorated by World International John Peel Day, a grandiose title that seems to encompass little more than live gigs played in his honour.</p> <p>I was raised to never speak ill of the dead, and I don't mean to sound churlish or mean-spirited here, but is there too much hoopla about John Peel, or more specifically, his work? It is almost hagiography and moving precariously close to deification. </p> <p>It's not just the histrionic claims, made on his behalf, of a cultural reach and influence exceeding almost anyone else in modern Britain, it's the sheer number of records with a Peel theme: from the reverential (John Peel \u2013 A Tribute) to the personal (John Peel and Sheila: The Pig's Big 78s), the era-specific (Right Time Wrong Speed 1977-1987), the date-specific (Classics from John Peel's All Time Festive Fifty), the avant garde (FABRICLIVE07), the nostalgic (John Peel's Dandelion) to the seemingly endless Peel Sessions albums. </p> <p>I stress, this is <em>not</em> an attack on Peel, who was a great broadcaster and seemed like a lovely fella. And I am definitely <em>not</em> trying to be controversial or iconoclastic for the sake of it. But surely it is absurd to lionise a man whose job was to play records. Certainly, he played good music and broke new bands, but fundamentally, he played records. Yet he now seems to have been transformed into a glorious combination of Elvis, Churchill, Mother Theresa and Shakespeare in the public consciousness. He is feted as some sort of rock'n'roll titan, comparable to Elvis and Jagger, as if he actually made records instead of just spinning them on his turntable. </p> <p>Is this mass hysteria here? Something has to explain the dewy-eyed sentimentalising, the virtual canonisation of his name and legacy. Perhaps nobody good enough has come along to replace him in people's affections. Perhaps post-modernism is to blame, with its instant nostalgia and fetishisation of the recent past. Perhaps it's because of the increased infantilisation of society; we revere a man who played pop records as if he were a creative genius who bestrode his art form. Who knows?
