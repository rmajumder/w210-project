  "<p>Karl Friedrich is proud to live in Karl Marx Hof, Vienna's vast monument to municipal socialism. But not as proud as he used to be.</p> <p>\"We had great times here. There were artists and writers all around. Great parties. They're all gone now,\" says the former communist. \"Now half the families in my block are immigrants. They can't speak German. They can't even speak English.\"</p> <p>Built in the 1920s to house the working class of the post-imperial capital, Karl Marx Hof was one of the first social housing schemes in Europe, an expressionist fortress of the left in \"Red Vienna\" and then a battleground in Austria's civil war that pitted the socialists against the neo-fascists in the 1930s.</p> <p>Gottfried, an 80-year-old who has lived here most of his life, remains loyal to the political creed that automatically went with the address.</p> <p>\"I'm a worker. I grew up with the socialists, always voted for them,\" he says, declining to give his surname. \"And I'll be voting for them again on Sunday. How could it be otherwise?\"</p> <p>The problem for Austria's Social Democrats, hoping to win an early general election on Sunday triggered by the collapse of the coalition government of Social and Christian Democrats, is that Gottfried is a member of a dying breed - the core voters of the centre-left.</p> <p>\"Everybody here used to vote socialist. But on Sunday a lot of people here will vote for the [far right] Freedom party,\" says Friedrich, who hopes the centre-left and hard right will form a new taboo-breaking coalition.</p> <p>His hunch is borne out by the opinion polls, which predict a surge in support for the anti-immigrant populists of the extreme right, not least because of the inroads they are making into what used to be the guaranteed support for the Social Democrats.</p> <p>\"The Freedom party is now the most proletarian party in Austria,\" says Anton Pelinka, an Austrian political scientist. \"If you look at Vienna, the Freedom party is doing very well in the working class districts.\"</p> <p>That spells trouble for Austria's Social Democrats (SPO), whose own leader and chancellor, Alfred Gusenbauer, committed political suicide in June by pandering to the main tabloid newspaper and turning Eurosceptic. The U-turn brought down the government and ended Gusenbauer's career. But the problem is more fundamental.</p> <p>\"Austrian social democracy,\" says Fritz Plasser, a leading analyst, \"is in a deep crisis, over its identity, over its programme, and over its prospects.\"</p> <p>The same might be said about almost anywhere you look in Europe. If Labour is anxious about Gordon Brown and the prospects of electoral meltdown, the picture is similarly grim for the centre-left in Germany, France, Italy and beyond.</p> <p><strong>Demoralisation</strong></p> <p>In eight general elections over the past year in Europe from Poland to Ireland and from Finland to Greece, the centre-left has suffered defeat. Only in Spain and Portugal does the centre-left remain solidly in power. Almost everywhere else the mood among social democrats is one of demoralisation and confusion, with hapless leaders adding to the disarray and incapable of drafting popular policies on salient issues such as immigration or the turmoil resulting from free markets and globalised economics.</p> <p>\"All economics nowadays are borderless, while politics still has national borders,\" says Pelinka. \"National governments can do less and less and national politics are in decline.\"</p> <p>If true, this appears to hurt the left more than the centre-right, which claims it is more in tune with the zeitgeist.</p> <p>\"We've won the ideological battle. The culture and moral relativism that the left spread around from the 1980s, we're leaving it behind,\" the French prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, told a conference of 70 centre-right parties this summer.</p> <p>Fillon's confidence might be misplaced. Since taking power last year he and President Nicolas Sarkozy have sunk to ever lower levels of popularity in France, according to the TNS-Sofres pollsters. But this apparent weakness does not translate into gains for the opposition Socialists, who have lost three presidential elections in a row and are mired in a six-way battle to decide who will become the party leader.</p> <p>What has historically been Europe's biggest and oldest political party, Germany's Social Democrats or SPD, is haemorrhaging support, bogged down in internal fighting and policy confusion, despite coalescing in government with Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats. If the extreme right is eating away at the Social Democrats in Austria, in Germany it is the hard left that is stealing the SPD vote in what might be described as old east Germany's revenge.</p> <p>The new party, called simply the Left, the rump of cold war east German communists joined by west German SPD defectors, is polling at 15%, mainly at the expense of the SPD, which slumped to 20% in the polls this summer under the leadership of Kurt Beck, who has just been ousted in a coup by the right wing of the party. </p> <p>The popular foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, will now challenge Merkel for the chancellorship next year. But while he might halt or reverse the SPD's decline, Steinmeier is a civil servant who has never stood for elected office or held senior party political jobs.</p> <p>In Italy the predicament for the mainstream left seems even more dismal as it struggles to present a coherent challenge to the rightwing populist Silvio Berlusconi, who is enjoying high poll ratings despite immigration controversies, the collapse of the national carrier, Alitalia, and the Naples rubbish crisis since being re-elected prime minister in April.</p> <p>\"He who maintains a coalition in Italy governs and Veltroni can't,\" says James Walston, a political scientist at the American University in Rome of the centre-left leader, Walter Veltroni, the former mayor of Rome who heads the new Democratic party. The new movement is crippled by old splits and rivalries between secular and Roman Catholic leftists. </p> <p>As in Austria, the populist parties of the far right, the Northern League and the post-fascist National Alliance, are also attracting traditional leftist voters on issues such as immigration.</p> <p><strong>Populist</strong></p> <p>In Karl Marx Hof, Gottfried is confident that despite the sliding fortunes of the centre-left his Social Democrats will win on Sunday. He may well be right. Under a new populist leader, Werner Faymann, who has the support of the Kronenzeitung bestselling tabloid, the SPO is narrowly ahead in opinion polls at around 30% after promising a spending bonanza, the slashing of VAT on food and the abolition of student fees.</p> <p>But that result would be a historic low for the Social Democrats, five percentage points down on two years ago and seven down on 2002. The real victor looks likely to be the far right, tipped to take a quarter of the vote, 10 points up on two years ago. \"The paradox,\" says Pelinka, \"is that the Social Democrats will get the worst result in their history, and still declare victory.\"</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337967602\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>America's presidential election was thrown into disarray last night after John McCain said he wanted to suspend his campaign and delay tomorrow night's debate against Barack Obama to focus on the financial crisis. </p> <p>The Republican candidate made his stunning announcement at the end of a day spent on damage control, amid reports that a firm linked to his campaign manager was on the payroll of the mortgage giant whose collapse precipitated the meltdown on Wall Street.</p> <p>In an appearance from New York, McCain said it was time to put politics aside and return to Washington to help Congress reach a deal on President George Bush's proposal for a $700bn economic rescue package. </p> <p>\"It has become clear that no consensus has developed to support the administration's proposal,\" McCain said. \"I do not believe that the plan on the table will pass as it currently stands, and we are running out of time.\" He did not say he would suspend television advertisements, and did not rule out attendance at the debate.</p> <p>In response, Obama rejected McCain's argument that the Republican was trying to rise above politics. \"This is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from the person who in approximately 40 days will be responsible for dealing with this mess,\" the Democratic party candidate said. \"It is going to be part of the president's job to deal with more than one thing at once.\"</p> <p>The University of Mississippi, which is hosting the debate, said the encounter between McCain and Obama would go ahead as planned.</p> <p>Obama said he had been involved in talks to try to reach a consensus in the Senate while on the campaign trail. He said that McCain had mulled over the possibility of cancelling their debate in a conversation earlier yesterday.</p> <p>It is the third time in a month that McCain has shaken up the campaign, after choosing the outsider Sarah Palin as his running mate and cancelling the first day of his party's convention because of fears about Hurricane Gustav.</p> <p>The proposal to cancel the TV debates was immediately dismissed by Democrats as a play meant to divert attention from McCain's slide in the polls due to the deteriorating economy and the row over his campaign manager, Rick Davis.</p> <p>Republican senators claimed McCain's desire to return to Washington was evidence of his commitment to his \"country first\" election slogan. Other commentators described the move as an attempt to shift the public focus from the economy.</p> <p>The worsening economic outlook has led to a drop in support for McCain, with polls showing that voters consider Obama better equipped to lead America through the crisis. McCain was also buffeted yesterday by reports that a firm linked to Davis was on the payroll of a mortgage lender at the heart of the US credit crisis. </p> <p>The New York Times and Newsweek reported that the lending giant Freddie Mac had paid Davis's consultancy firm $15,000 a month from 2005 until last month - about the time Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were taken over by the government and about two years after Davis took up his job as campaign manager.</p> <p>The continued arrangement contradicts claims from McCain as recently as Sunday that there was no connection between his manager's lobbying firm, Davis Manafort, and the mortgage companies. </p> <p>The McCain campaign accused the New York Times of extreme bias and of acting as an \"Obama advocacy organisation\". But the McCain camp did not deny the payments made to Davis Manafort. It said Davis had separated from the firm in 2006, and had not received a salary since.</p> <p>The revelations could accelerate an erosion in support for McCain as the public mood sours about the $700bn bailout of Wall Street firms. New poll yesterday gave Obama a lead over McCain after weeks of an apparent dead heat.</p> <p>The Washington Post-ABC news poll gave Obama 52% against 43% for McCain. Obama's lead over McCain was commanding on issues of the economy, with voters saying by 53% to 39% that they trusted the Democrat over the Republican. A Los Angeles Times-Bloomberg poll released later yesterday showed a narrower lead for Obama, who was on 49% against 45% for McCain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337956125\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/09/24/US_poll_2509.gif\" alt=\"US poll\" width=\"231\" height=\"476\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Davis, who worked on McCain's failed 2000 run for the Republican leadership, began working directly for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae that year as head of the companies' pressure group, Homeownership Alliance. The alliance was set up to oppose regulation of the mortgage industry. Davis earned $30,000 a month for his work which ended in 2005, when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac disbanded the coalition, according to the New York Times. But it said Davis's firm continued to be paid $15,000 a month by Freddie Mac.</p>",
  "<p>With its imposing red brick facade and quaint gold lettering above a grand entrance, the Midland hotel has stood out as a Manchester landmark for over a century. In the early hours of Wednesday morning an odd event took place in the pillared entrance hall, where the city's cotton traders used to meet, which may earn the hotel a modest place in more contemporary history.</p> <p>At 3.15am, as delegates celebrated the last night of the Labour conference, two government figures drew journalists into a circle to confirm a rumour that had been swirling around all night: Ruth Kelly would be resigning from the cabinet.</p> <p>In hushed tones, Damian McBride and Julie Crowley, special advisers respectively to the prime minister and the outgoing transport secretary, said that Kelly had asked the prime minister in May to set her free at the next reshuffle to spend more time with her young children.</p> <p>The briefing brought to a close a hectic night of activity which had been kicked off at 10.30pm when Newsnight reported that Kelly might be among a series of ministers to be moved in an imminent cabinet reshuffle. By 11.30pm the Guardian was able to confirm her departure as fact. No 10 sources initially played down the report, but within hours it was forced to confirm that Kelly would be going after the transport secretary had cleared a statement.</p> <p>As news of Kelly's resignation was reported on early morning radio and television bulletins, a war of words erupted between the various camps. The Blairite wing of the Labour party accused Downing Street of triggering another \"controlled explosion\" to flush out a potential rebel by leaking news of the Kelly resignation. </p> <p>Some allies of the prime minister hit back, saying that the \"toxic timing\" of the resignation was designed by Blairites to give the impression of \"dirty tricks\" by No 10. If so, it was not the first \"dirty trick\" involving Ruth Kelly on Tuesday. As journalists filed back into the press room after Gordon Brown's speech, several reporters were being rung by the Conservative press office and told that Toby Helm, the Observer's Whitehall editor, had heard Kelly saying the speech was \"awful\". The story was completely untrue. Helm had not even set eyes on Ruth Kelly, let alone overheard her. </p> <p>When he contacted the Tories and asked them what was going on he was told: \"Oh, we tried to ring you and check it out. Someone told us you heard it.\" It could have been these rumours that led a No 10 figure outside the prime minister's immediate circle to be a little indiscreet and speculate - with some degree of accuracy - about ministerial movements.</p> <p>It was this cock-up rather than conspiracy theory that was being advocated by some wise heads in Downing Street yesterday. \"This was absolutely not planned because our main aim was to ensure that the focus was on Gordon's speech,\" one figure said. The plan lay in ruins as the Kelly resignation overshadowed coverage of Brown's speech yesterday. Uneasy ministers said they now fear that the prime minister's position is becoming perilous. </p> <p>\"Gordon made the best speech I have heard him make,\" one minister said. \"But the overnight events mean that he is now back to square one. He will be toast by Christmas.\"</p> <p>The events at the Midland were set in train in May when Kelly went to see the prime minister to inform him that she would like to leave the cabinet at the next reshuffle. She wanted to devote more time to her four young children. </p> <p>In her conference speech yesterday, which was rewritten after the night's events, she said: \"I ask for your understanding when I say that I now owe it to my children and family to take a step back and start putting them first. If I do not, then I know that this is something I will come to regret deeply.\"</p> <p>But there were other reasons. As a strong Catholic, and member of the Opus Dei group, Kelly felt deeply uncomfortable about the human fertilisation and embryology bill, which she would be expected to support when it reaches its final Commons stage. Her parliamentary seat - Bolton West - is marginal and she may even decide not to stand at the next election. She was also understood to be dismayed with Brown's leadership and to have become angered at briefings that she was going to be sacked or would resign over the human fertilisation bill. </p> <p>Her departure marks a significant moment for Labour. Elected at the age of 28 in the 1997 landslide, she became the youngest woman cabinet minister when she was appointed education secretary aged 36 in 2004. </p> <p>Her allies remain highly suspicious of the circumstances surrounding the leak of her resignation plans. They have not finally decided which of the two explanations to believe - an innocent, unauthorised slip by a No 10 official or an operation to flush her out. </p> <p>Cabinet-level sources are uneasy too. Geoff Hoon, the chief whip, was irritated when he was asked about the reshuffle plans out of the blue on Newsnight. The programme accurately reported that he would like to replace Peter Mandelson as Britain's European commissioner. But this cannot happen until a new commission president - or the current occupant, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso - is given a new mandate next June. The cabinet-level source gave a taste of the breakdown in trust that is beginning to paralyse the government. \"We have given Gordon a lot of space this week to make his speech claiming to be the big man to fix the economy, but they are so small-minded and paranoid that they ruin their own day by briefing this stuff, forcing Hoon to eat a shit sandwich live on TV. It tells you everything you need to know about the way they operate. This all comes from Gordon.\"</p> <p>The Blairites believe there is a pattern. They are convinced Downing Street \"flushed out\" the former whip Siobhain McDonagh and the former Scotland Office minister David Cairns, who were both forced to resign after it emerged they had lost confidence in Brown. Friend of Cairns said that he had had to threaten Downing Street that he would expose them, when he heard reports they were planning to plant stories rubbishing him.</p> <p>One Brownite indicated suspicions were held equally on the other side. \"The reshuffle leak was deliberately timed to undermine Gordon. It appears to have been done in a way to look like No 10's fingerprints are all over it.\"</p> <p>The Conservatives can barely believe their luck. \"This all sounds like us in the 1990s,\" one said.</p> <h2>Night of drama</h2> <p><strong>September 23<br></strong><br>\u00b7 <strong>4pm</strong> Conservative official claims Ruth Kelly described Gordon Brown's conference speech as \"terrible\". The party says it has been told that Toby Helm, the Observer's Whitehall editor, heard Kelly saying the speech was \"awful\". The story was untrue. Helm had not even set eyes on Kelly, let alone overheard her. She later denies it herself, saying the reports are absolute rubbish.</p> <p>\u00b7 <strong>10.30pm</strong> Newsnight reports that Kelly is likely to resign as part of a cabinet reshuffle next Friday. The programme also reports that the chief whip, Geoff Hoon, may go to Brussels as a European commissioner - seconds before interviewing Hoon, who is caught flatfooted.</p> <p>\u00b7 <strong>11.30pm</strong> Guardian establishes Kelly is quitting.</p> <p><strong>September 24</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 <strong>1.15am</strong> Government sources confirm resignation plan.</p> <p>\u00b7 <strong>3.15am</strong> Damian McBride, Brown's press adviser, and Julie Crowley, Kelly's special adviser, tell journalists in the Midland hotel that Kelly is going.</p> <p>\u00b7 <strong>7.15am</strong> Brown confirms in an interview that Kelly is resigning to spend more time with her family.</p> <p>\u00b7 <strong>9.30am</strong> Kelly makes first public comments. \"This is purely a decision that has been taken for family reasons.\"</p>",
  "<p>As the two men who would succeed him train like Olympic athletes for tomorrow's foreign policy debate, pause for a moment to complete your final report on the 43rd president of the United States. What would you say?</p> <p>I would sum up his two terms in four words: hubris followed by nemesis.</p> <p>Remember the mood music of eight years ago. The greatest power the world has ever seen. Rome on steroids. An international system said to be unipolar, and Washington's unabashed embrace of unilateralism. The US as \"Prometheus unbound\", according to the neoconservative commentator Charles Krauthammer. Wall Street investment bankers bestriding the financial globe as Pentagon generals did the military globe and Harvard professors the soft power one. Masters of the universe. Personifying that hubristic moment: George Walker Bush.</p> <p>And now: nemesis. The irony of the Bush years is that a man who came into office committed to both celebrating and reinforcing sovereign, unbridled national power has presided over the weakening of that power in all three dimensions: military, economic and soft. \"I am not convinced we are winning it in Afghanistan,\" Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a congressional committee earlier this month. Many on the ground say that's an understatement. The massive, culpable distraction of Iraq, Bush's war of choice, leaves the US - and with it the rest of the west - on the verge of losing the war of necessity. Here, resurgent in Afghanistan and Pakistan, are the jihadist enemies who attacked the US on September 11 2001. By misusing military power, Bush has weakened it.</p> <p>Economically, the Bush presidency ends with a financial meltdown on a scale not seen for 70 years. The proud conservative deregulators (John McCain long among them) now oversee a partial nationalisation of the American economy that would make even a French socialist blush. A government bailout that will total close to a trillion dollars, plus the cumulative cost of the Iraq war, will push the national debt to more than $11 trillion. The flagships of Wall Street either go bust or have to be salvaged, with the help of government or foreign money. Most ordinary Americans feel poorer and less secure.</p> <p>The decline in soft power - the power to attract - is also dramatic. The Pew Global Attitudes Survey has recorded a precipitous worldwide fall in favourable views of the US since 2001. The map is chequered, of course, but the distaste extends beyond policies of the Bush administration to things such as \"American ways of doing business\", and \"American ideas about democracy\". Iraq has been central to this collapse of credibility and attractiveness. When Bush denounces Russia for invading a sovereign country (Georgia), as he did again at the UN on Tuesday, a cry of \"humbug\" goes up around the world. Now American-style free market capitalism is taking a further hit, while some of the alternative models are looking better.</p> <p>Last weekend, five former US secretaries of state - two Democrat, three Republican - gathered for a panel discussion on the future of foreign policy, televised by CNN. Asked by Christiane Amanpour what should be the biggest concern for the new president, Colin Powell replied: \"To restore a sense of confidence in the United States of America.\" Madeleine Albright added that the world of 2009 would be full of issues \"that can only be solved in cooperation with other countries\". And, Republican and Democrat, they chorussed \"close Guant\u00e1namo\".</p> <p>Even George Bush now seems to concur with this criticism of George Bush - and I don't just mean speculation that the father is privately critical of the son. Eight years ago, president Bush the younger hardly seemed to know what the word \"multilateral\" meant. In the course of his farewell address to the UN general assembly this week, he used the word \"multilateral\" 10 times.</p> <p>Obviously not all this mess can be blamed on Bush: he's not responsible for the epochal rise of China, nor for jihadist terrorists' long-term hatred of the west.</p> <p>But a great deal of it can. At the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri, you can still see the painted glass sign that president Harry Truman placed on his desk in the oval office: The Buck Stops Here. (On the back it says: I'm From Missouri.) The buck stops there. The contrast between the president from Missouri and the president from Texas is painful. Judgment, prudence, vision, patience, honesty - every quality that the 33rd president so signally possessed, as the US remade the world after 1945, has been signally lacking in the 43rd.</p> <p>Iraq, the US's greatest strategic blunder in at least 30 years, is Bush's fault. The buck stops there. And the more we learn about it, the clearer it becomes that it was pursued with a mixture of self-deception and lies. The reporter Ron Suskind has a new book out in which he recounts how, in the runup to war, British intelligence secured unique access to Saddam Hussein's head of intelligence, Tahir Jalil Habbush.</p> <p>Habbush told them what turned out subsequently to be the truth: that Saddam had ceased his programme of weapons of mass destruction, but would not admit it, because he was obsessed with keeping regional enemies such as Iran in a state of fear and uncertainty. That version was corroborated by Saddam's foreign minister, to whom French intelligence had originally secured access.</p> <p>The Bush-Cheney White House ignored both reports, preferring what turned out to be the fabrications of a German intelligence source codenamed Curveball. Curveball indeed. Some of Suskind's reporting has been questioned, but the basic story is not in doubt. The Bush-Cheney White House pressed ahead to war on a fraudulent prospectus, suppressing and distorting very important contrary evidence. As a senior member of the administration told Suskind: \"We're an empire now, and when we act we create our own reality.\" Hubris has rarely been better expressed.</p> <p>Something similar happened with the vertiginous unreality of hyper-leveraged Wall Street investment banking over the past decade. The financiers' motto, too, could have been \"We create our own reality\". Again, nemesis follows hubris as the night the day. The White House was not directly responsible for what looks like wild financial irresponsibility, but it was responsible for not supervising and regulating it - something even John McCain is now at least implicity admitting. The buck stopped there.</p> <p>As for the decline in American soft power, that is something for which George Bush was directly to blame. His arrogance, his unilateralism, his insensitivity, his long-time denial of the need for urgent action on climate change: all fed directly into the plummeting credit of the US around the world. It would have been a different story with a different president.</p> <p>For years now, we have seen those who hate the US abusing and burning effigies of Bush. The truth is, the anti-Americans should be building gilded monuments to him. For no one has done more to serve the cause of anti-Americanism than GW Bush. It is we who like and admire the US who should, by rights, be burning effigies. But now, at last, we live in hope of a better America.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timothygartonash.com\"><br>timothygartonash.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Since John McCain so desperately and obviously wanted to <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-09-24-mccain-debate_N.htm\">change the subject</a>, permit me to begin by not taking the bait and not changing the subject.</p> <p>Wednesday was the worst day of the campaign for McCain. The revelations about <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/us/politics/24davis.html\">Rick Davis' firm doing lobbying work for Freddie Mac</a> had the potential, and still may have the potential, to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/24/johnmccain.congress\">cost Davis his job</a>. Certainly the story had the potential to eat up a lot of cable television time over the next two days. Over the long term, and most importantly, the story has the power, if used properly by the Democrats, to dissolve any morsel of credibility McCain had on the subject of dealing with the current fiscal crisis.</p> <p>So keep that straight. The cable coverage of McCain's ridiculous gambit about suspending his campaign and delaying Friday night's debate is not making that link explicit, because that's just not the sort of thing television does except when it really slaps them in the face, like when Bill Clinton bombed Sudan the night the House of Representatives voted the impeachment articles. </p> <p>But I can guarantee you, if you think the McCain brain trust wasn't manically trying to conjure up a way to wriggle out of the Davis mess and hand the media a new story to yak about, then I have a non-bridge in Alaska to non-sell you.</p> <p>This was also the day when the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/23/AR2008092303667.html\">Washington Post and ABC released a poll</a> showing McCain nine points behind Barack Obama. On Hardball, Chris Matthews is, to his credit, making this connection: that McCain is changing the subject because he's dropping in the polls. In fact the desperation of McCain's move makes one think that maybe his own internal polls show a gloomier picture still.</p> <p>What a joke. What an unserious and contemptible joke. And so typically dishonest. Now that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/us/politics/25mccain.html\">Obama has spoken</a>, we know that it was Obama who called McCain, first suggesting that the two issue a bipartisan joint statement on the crisis. This obviously got McCain and Steve Schmidt thinking. Hey, maybe we can put country first here and \u2026 oops, scratch that. Since we're in such a tight spot today anyway, maybe we can put naked politics first here and go public, steal his thunder, act like we were the white hats who came up with the idea. Yeah! And while we're at it, let's take it a step further. Let's don the sack cloth of piety and insist that we feel this is so important we even think the debate should be suspended. </p> <p>Think about the kind of mind that's required to even think up something like this. I could never think up something like this. Most average people, of whatever political persuasion, could never do it. Some pundits are talking about desperation and Hail Mary passes and so on, but that doesn't really begin to describe the deviousness at work here. </p> <p>This is like a man who gets caught cheating on his wife and then, with his back against the wall and with confrontation looming, goes out and intentionally wrecks the car, contriving to break a few ribs and get rushed to the hospital, all to delay the inevitable conflict and in the cynical knowledge that, in front of the doctors and until the wounds are bound, the wife will be forced to offer sympathy. Males are messed up creatures, but believe me, only a rather small percentage of us is really capable of thinking this connivingly.</p> <p>Will it work? I don't think so. Granted, 98% of Americans don't know about the Rick Davis story, and probably around 90% don't know about the Washington Post poll. So some people may buy it. But I don't believe most will. It just looks too sneaky. Even if one doesn't smell desperation, the odor of weirdness is all over the move.</p> <p>And it looks unpresidential. Obama came out and looked presidential. Presidents need to be able to handle two problems at once, he said. Now is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from us. We both have big planes. They can get us from Washington to Mississippi pretty quickly if need be. His press conference offered, in fact, a good look at how he would be as president. He seeks non-confrontation. But he slips his points in steadily and coolly. Pretty smooth performance.</p> <p>And he seems to be winning. Perhaps inevitably, <a href=\"http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReportUC.aspx?g=54d651a7-a62b-4420-bb32-9dd6b2df8c02\">one polling outfit did a snap poll</a> on all this. Results? </p> <blockquote> <p>Hold the debate as scheduled: 50%<br>Hold it but focus on the economy not foreign policy: 36%.<br>Postpone: 10%.</p> <p>Suspend campaigns: 14%<br>Continue campaign: 31%<br>Re-focus campaign: 48%</p> </blockquote> <p>Oopsie. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/statement-commission-presidential-debates/story.aspx?guid={82328457-C331-4D2C-B2A1-28A01E37D7A7}&amp;dist=hppr\">commission on presidential debates</a> stated shortly after Obama spoke that the debate will go on. If the commission says it and Obama says it, it will go on, I suspect. But we have yet to see which chess piece McCain moves next. Who can imagine that? Think of the most cynical thing you can think of, then double it.</p> <p>Abraham Lincoln ran for re-election while leading the Union troops in the civil war. Franklin Roosevelt ran for re-election in the midst of terrible depression in 1936, a far worse economic crisis than we have right now, and in 1944 while prosecuting the second world war. </p> <p>If John McCain can't debate while thinking about the country's economy, then he's even more ill-equipped to hold the job than I think he is. But of course he is capable of doing both. His proposal is not serious. It is just a rancidly political act. That he goes before cameras and tries to pass it off as nonpolitical, hoping that people will buy it, is what makes it contemptible.</p> <p>When Mario Cuomo was governor of New York, he devoted a speech to improving the lot of children in New York state. He declared \"The decade of the child.\" When, after a year or two, it became clear that somehow child poverty rates had stayed more or less the same, a joke began circulating around Albany: but he didn't mean this decade.</p> <p>We've reached a similar point today, but far worse, because Cuomo's intentions were at least decent. John McCain's intentions have to do with nothing loftier than the next news cycle. He is the man who said country first. He just didn't mean this country.</p>",

According to experts, this is actually the most absurd, impetuous and nakedly disingenuous suggestion that has ever been made in the history of politics, including Ancient Greece and the rudimentary organisational systems archeologists have identified in the lives of early man.

The Obama campaign says their candidate called McCain at 8.30am today and McCain responded at 2.30pm. But the McCain campaign seems to be trying to argue that McCain heard nothing of the 8.30am call and rang Obama at 2.30pm on his own initiative, to suggest the joint statement. It's like the Cuban Missile Crisis and the communications between Kennedy and Khrushchev. In a way.</p> <p>UPDATE II: Debate venue corrected.<br></p>",
  "<p>John McCain today proposed postponing the first presidential debate so he and Barack Obama could stay in Washington and help Congress craft an economic rescue package. Obama swiftly rejected the idea of rescheduling Friday's event.</p> <p>McCain proposed the two candidates \"suspend\" their campaigns and meet with fellow senators and others in Washington, saying the economic turmoil facing the country requires they put partisan politics on hold to work toward a solution.</p> <p>In a press conference in Florida shortly after the McCain announcement, Obama said the debate should go forward as planned.</p> <p>\"This is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from the person who in approximately 40 days will be responsible for dealing with this mess,\" Obama said. \"It is going to be part of the president's job to deal with more than one thing at once.\"</p> <p>The University of Mississippi, which is hosting the Friday debate, said the event would happen.</p> <p>During his press conference, McCain called for cooperation between Democrats and Republicans on the bailout plan, invoking what he described as the post-September 11 atmosphere of bi-partisanship.</p> <p>\"I am confident that before the markets open on Monday we can achieve consensus on legislation that will stabilise our financial markets, protect taxpayers and homeowners and earn the confidence of the American people,\" he said. \"All we must do to achieve this is temporarily set politics aside, and I am committed to doing so.\"</p> <p>Obama said he was involved in negotiations even on the campaign tail, speaking daily with congressional leaders and treasury secretary Henry Paulson, leader of the Bush administration effort. Obama added, \"If I can be helpful, then I am prepared to be anywhere, any time\".</p> <p>Obama said he and McCain earlier today discussed releasing a joint statement outlining principles they agree should be a part of the rescue package. He said McCain suggested suspending the debates, but added the announcement caught him by surprise.</p> <p>The move on McCain's part comes on the heels of bad news for his campaign, including reports this morning that top aide Rick Davis's consulting firm received substantial sums of money from mortgage company Freddie Mac, which is at the centre of the turmoil in the US banking system.</p> <p>The worsening economic situation has seen voters increasingly turning to Obama as the candidate best able to lead the country through the crisis. A Washington Post/ABC News poll this morning showed Obama leading 52% to 43% among likely voters. The poll shows voters trust Obama more to handle the economy, 53% to 39%.</p> <p>McCain said today he was driven to put the campaign on hold by the thus-far fruitless congressional debate on President Bush's proposed rescue plan. The plan, presented to legislators on Sunday, includes a $700bn bailout of the mortgage industry, and lawmakers are considering additional provisions to limit the pay of executives at the top of failing firms and to protect homeowners caught up in bad mortgages.</p> <p>Meanwhile, McCain told an Ohio television station yesterday that he had not had seen the Bush proposal \"in writing\".</p> <p>Neither McCain nor Obama hold leadership positions in the Senate, and senators involved in the negotiations have not indicated publicly that the men's absence is holding back progress on the economic rescue legislation.<br>Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell pronounced McCain's proposal \"an outstanding idea\" and said he hoped the Obama campaign would consider it.<br>Independent senator Joseph Lieberman, a former Democrat who now backs McCain, also praised McCain's idea and said Obama should return to the Senate too. </p> <p>Democrats were quick to dismiss McCain's move as a ploy, with New York senator Charles Schumer, a top hand in the bailout legislation negotiations, labelling it \"weird\".</p> <p>Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid said the candidates' return would inject presidential politics into the sensitive negotiations and \"distract important talks about the future of our nation's economy\".</p> <p>\"If that changes, we will call upon them,\" Reid said. \"We need leadership, not a campaign photo op.\"</p> <p>Erick Mullen, a Washington Democratic strategist, said McCain's move is a cynical effort to distract voters from the economic situation.</p> <p>\"After a decade of suspending any activity in the Senate which could have prevented this meltdown, his call today to silence the national conversation is reckless but typical of his half-cocked worldview,\" Mullen wrote in an email. \"When someone read him the latest news about Davis, the polls and Palin's tepid reception at the UN, he wants to change the subject.\"</p>",
  "<p>George Bush will deliver a nationally televised address tonight to drum up support for his troubled $700bn financial rescue plan amid a new poll showing the US public opposed to bailing out Wall Street.</p> <p>Bush plans to explain to the public at 9pm Washington time how this week's economic upheaval affects them, his spokeswoman said as the markets wobbled in the face of a continued bailout backlash in Congress.</p> <p>The president has his work cut out for him. A poll released today by the Los Angeles Times and Bloomberg found 55% of Americans opposing government aid to failing financial firms.</p> <p>\"There's a lot we all could do to explain how this relates to ordinary Americans,\" Henry Paulson, the US treasury secretary, acknowledged during congressional testimony today.</p> <p>Paulson has agreed to caps on executive compensation at firms receiving help under the bailout, a key priority of both Barack Obama and John McCain. He also sought to downplay the staggering price tag of the plan, predicting that the government would recoup its investment after selling off devalued assets.</p> <p>Yet Paulson's leading role in the response to the financial crisis has left Bush's political influence over the $700bn rescue in question. </p> <p>The treasury secretary, a former CEO of Goldman Sachs, made the rounds on Capitol Hill today to sway wary members of Congress, one day after similar pleas from US vice-president Dick Cheney reportedly fell flat.</p> <p>\"Where's the president here?\" Chris Dodd, the Democratic chairman of the Senate banking committee, asked on MSNBC today. </p> <p>Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate leader, called on Bush to take ownership of his past rosy rhetoric on the US economy.</p> <p>\"It is time for him to explain how he could tell our country for months that our economy was fine \u2013 yet overnight declare that if American taxpayers don't accept his bailout bill, our country will face an economic disaster,\" Reid said.</p> <p>Bush's role in signing off on the concession was unclear.</p> <p>Before joining Paulson today before the financial services committee in the House of Representatives, Benjamin Bernanke delivered solo testimony before the congressional joint economic panel. He and Paulson were conscious of the need to rebound after they faced furious resistance from Dodd's committee yesterday.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve chairman admitted under questioning that he and Paulson did not inform Bush about the severity of the downturn until Thursday, hours before the alarm was sounded in Congress.</p> <p>Lloyd Doggett, a Democratic congressman from Texas, said Bush was on target with a controversial July comment that Wall Street was experiencing \"a hangover\".</p> <p>\"The problem is,\" Doggett quipped, \"that the people getting asked to clean up the broken furniture didn't get invited to the party.\"</p> <p>Bernanke offered a bleak picture of the US economy, predicting that growth would contract during the second half of this year and warning of a higher inflation risk in the wake of unpredictable oil prices.</p> <p>America's senior banker told the economic panel that a recession could be imminent without approval of the bailout, which would give the treasury department broad powers to buy up as much as $700bn in toxic mortgage-backed assets from financial institutions.</p> <p>When asked about various Democratic alternatives, from tapping revered financier Warren Buffett to manage the rescue to releasing the $700bn in installments, Bernanke largely deferred to Paulson.</p> <p>\"You're asking my opinion as an economist,\" Bernanke told New York senator Charles Schumer, who has proposed a phased bailout with an initial price tag of $150bn. \"Unfortunately, this is a matter for psychologists.\"</p> <p>The Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg poll was not the only attempt to read the US public's pulse on the financial crisis. CNN found that 62% of Americans support government involvement in the markets, but 65% believing that any bailout would be unfair to taxpayers.</p> <p>Perhaps the most telling number in CNN's poll was the 88% of respondents who described themselves as concerned or scared by the Wall Street tumult, which has frozen credit at even small-scale banks.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the bailout debate has obscured ideological boundaries as Republicans and Democrats alike continue to preach caution.</p> <p>Onetime presidential hopeful Ron Paul, a longtime critic of Bush administration economic policy, summed up the tumult: \"I don't know who the conservatives are and who the liberals are,\" he marvelled.</p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl4HIc-yfgM\">new video</a> has emerged showing Sarah Palin, John McCain's running mate, playing a central role in a church service in Alaska in which witchcraft is denounced.</p> <p>Thomas Muthee, a Kenyan who is a regular preacher at Palin's local Pentecostal church in Wasilla, made a passionate plea to defeat witchcraft and other supposed enemies of Palin during a sermon three years ago.</p> <p>The role of the witchfinder in Palin's life raises new questions about how much McCain's team investigated her background before naming her as his vice-presidential running mate.</p> <p>The new video, available on YouTube, shows Palin standing in front of him at the service, head bowed, her hands held by two members of the congregation.</p> <p>Muthee, in the sermon, calls on members of the church to try to gain footholds in centres of influence, such as politics and the media, and praises Palin for her bid to become governor of Alaska. He spoke about the hindrances she faced from her enemies.</p> <p>\"In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus, every form of witchcraft is what you rebuke. In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus, father make away now,\" Muthee said.</p> <p>In a video that emerged last week, Palin, in a speech to the church on June 8 this year, thanked Muthee for his help in getting her elected governor. She said his invocation was \"very, very powerful\".</p> <p>The Democratic candidate, Barack Obama, faced weeks of damaging reports earlier this year over his links to his controversial Chicago pastor, Jeremiah Wright, who was accused of being unpatriotic. The links between Palin and Muthee have the potential to damage her candidacy.</p> <p>The Christian Science Monitor reported that Muthee, while in Kenya, led a campaign to find the source of alleged witchcraft after a series of fatal car accidents in Kiambu. He blamed a local woman called Mama Jane, who is reported to have been forced to leave the area.<br>Muthee, in a promotional video, said: \"We prayed, we fasted, the lord showed us a spirit of witchcraft resting over the place.\"</p> <p>McCain's campaign team has largely kept Palin away from the media. But she is doing occasional interviews and faces a debate with her opposite number, Joe Biden, next week, both of which offer a chance for witchcraft to be raised.</p>",
  "<p>While we're on the subject of bailouts, here's a candidate: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/education/18grant.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">Pell grants</a>, the largest federal aid programme, is projecting a $6bn shortfall next year, as students increasingly apply for financial assistance to attend college. The causes, unlike some other bailouts of late, don't require a translator to understand. As the economy continues to struggle, more students require financial assistance to pay for college, and the poor job market has simultaneously led many mid-career students to seek higher education and skills training. By the end of July, 800,000 more students had applied for federal aid than the previous year.</p> <p>This should be welcome news, because it indicates what was already believed to be true \u2013 a greater number of students are going to college, and a higher percentage of those students are from low-income brackets. Since lifetime earnings are tied to educational attainment, encouraging access to college will be good for our nation's financial future - but only if the government steps up to meet the demand.</p> <p>Created in 1972, the Pell grant programme distributes annual awards to low-income students ranging from $431 to $4,731. This year over six million students will receive aid, many of whom would not be able to access higher education without it. However, the programme has failed to keep pace with increasing enrolment and rapidly rising college tuitions. Congress appropriated $14bn for the current fiscal year, (some of which was itself meant to absorb previous shortages) but without the $6bn increase, the programme will need to reduce the size of its grants. </p> <p>The Pell shortfall has the misfortune of coinciding with a federal budget that is shrinking by the news cycle, particularly as the government continues to rescue failing financial companies like Bear Stearns and AIG with hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars. A mere $6bn for college access may not seem like much in comparison, but if that funding were to be lost it would represent an embarrassing double standard on the part of the US government. As policymakers throw around rhetoric about long-term economic solutions and defend the financial bailouts as safeguarding America's economy, the ties between education and that economy must not be ignored. </p> <p>Two-thirds of new jobs require higher education or advanced training, but only about half of US students who enrol in four-year colleges after high school earn a bachelor's degree within six years. What's more, while college attendance is on the rise, college completion is at a stalemate \u2013 out of 23 countries, the US was the only nation that showed no increase in its postsecondary graduation rate between 2000 and 2005. </p> <p>While Pell grants may not cover a student's entire tuition, they do increase the likelihood that a student can afford to stay in college long enough to graduate, making the difference between having to work 30 hours a week on top of classes, or taking out excessive loans to pay for their education. However, reports indicate that the <a href=\"http://www.educationsector.org/analysis/analysis_show.htm?doc_id=559757\">default rate</a> on loans to low-income students is also increasing, leading one to question whether the limited availability of aid like Pell grants will cause more students determined to go to college to fall into debt. As <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/opinion/l19econ.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1\">one student wrote in the New York Times last week</a> to the heads of the US Federal Reserve and Treasury: </p> <blockquote> <p>Dear Mr Bernanke and Mr Paulson:<br>My student loans are too big and it is hurting the economy. Can I have a bailout, please? I need $92,000. Thanks.</p> </blockquote> <p>Both presidential candidates speak about college access and improving educational attainment as a means of competing in a global marketplace. Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/amandascott/gG5pB4\">Barack Obama told an audience</a> in Ohio: \"If we want to see middle-class incomes rising like they did in the 1990s, we can't afford a future where so many Americans are priced out of college \u2026 where millions of jobs are going unfilled because Americans don't have the skills to work them and where barely one in 10 low-income students will ever get their college degree.\" John McCain <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/informing/news/PressReleases/ed12978d-a54f-471e-aeed-65c65bcba6da.htm\">wants to simplify financial aid</a> and argues that higher education is as much a part of economic competition as the job sector. </p> <p>It's time for the US to put its money where its mouth is. If lawmakers can see the need to save Bear Stearns and AIG from bankruptcy in the name of strengthening the nation, surely it can also step in to give the students who will carry our economy into the 21st century the support they deserve.</p>",
  "<p>In the New York Times, Bob Herbert asked, rhetorically, in his excellent <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/23/opinion/23herbert.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin\">column</a> on the Wall Street bailout: \"Have you ever seen a president who was more irrelevant than George W Bush is right now?\"</p> <p>Last week, MSNBC's Chris Matthews struck a similar note during his bloodbath of an interview with Eric Cantor, a Republican congressman from Virginia, <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/09/matthews-does-his-job-for-change.html\">noting</a> that a \"normal president, at this time of a crisis, would be on national television at nine at night talking to the American people about the problems we face\".</p> <p>The thing is, this isn't a recent occurrence. My co-blogger and I were talking about how Bush had all but disappeared <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/01/constitution-one-recipe-for-corn-dogs.html\">back in January</a>. He's been ridiculously absent for almost an entire year now \u2014 as the election has consumed the political media, he's slipped away almost wholly unnoticed, retreating to his bike rides and pretzel choking, or whatever it is he does to while away his days. It's only just become more evident now since there's what might fairly be called a giant national calamity of a sort that generally elicits a president's interest and presence.</p> <p>Of course, he's \"<a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2005/02/and-hes-not-crook-either.html\">not one of these bean counters</a>.\"</p> <p>He is, however, truly the most useless waste of space on the planet, whose only talent, such as it is, appears to being go awol.</p> <p>People joke, or say quite seriously, that we're all better off the less involved Bush is \u2014 to which there is certainly some truth, but it masks a reality that really shouldn't go unremarked upon: The people who are filling the void of leadership he's left are people he appointed. Our nation is being run by people we haven't elected because the guy we did choose doesn't seem to be interested in the job anymore.</p> <p>This fact has been patently obvious for at least a year. He's all but put an \"I'd Rather Be Brushclearin'!\" bumper sticker on Air Force One. It's no surprise he didn't have the decency to step down and let someone else do the job he can't be bothered doing (and for which he was always manifestly unqualified, anyway). It's no surprise that his own party didn't have the integrity to prioritise the good of the country over the good of their party and force out the idiot king. And it's no surprise that the Democrats didn't have the collective spine to put impeachment <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2006/05/interesting.html\">back on the table</a>. No, none of these things are surprising.</p> <p>But they are infuriating nonetheless.</p> <p>And they are remorselessly galling, these various derelictions of duty, having happened as they have under the red, white and blue shadow of an enormous star-spangled banner, to rousing shouts of \"My patriotism is better than yours!\" and spontaneous renditions of \"God Bless America\" \u2014 a bunch of self-proclaimed patriots with their Team Patriot <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2007/10/pin-this-motherfuckers.html\">lapel pins</a> and their futile fists clamped around the staffs of the Made-in-China mini-flags they wave.</p> <p>Everyone in Washington is a patriot these days, but no one cared enough about America to effectively address that its leader long ago abandoned the scene.</p> <p>And so we wait.</p> <p>While President Awol waits out the rest of his second term, we wait to see just how much destruction his disastrous leadership has wrought and wait to see how many Americans lose their <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q17h75pMQ4\">little pink houses</a> before he is evicted at long last from the white one we're all meant to own. We wait to see if, as I expect and dread, he will emerge from his ruinous presidency precisely as unscathed as the average American is scathed.</p> <p>We wait for an election that feels like it will surely never come, in which both of the candidates who are auditioning for role of Oval Office Occupant are promising change.</p> <p>That they actually want to do the job is a refreshing change in itself.</p>",
  "<p>More on today's Wash Post-ABC poll. A friend notes that Obama is +9 in the poll among white college graduates.

Here one must note the arguments of the conservative writer Charles Murray who, long before this particular poll was published, began arguing that they are too many college educated people in America. This makes little sense in economic terms in a knowledge-based world, but if you like Republicans in power, it makes a great deal of sense in political terms.</p> </blockquote> <p>Click through and read it.

  "<p>Marc Ambinder of the Atlantic has <a href=\"http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/09/gsegoguery.php\">a smart take</a> on why the McCain/Schmidt response is bogus:</p> <blockquote> <p>In a late-night missive written in Schmidt Gothic Bold, the McCain campaign denied what the stories did not allege -- namely, that Davis personally profited from Freddie Mac and therefore had a direct financial conflict of interest in helping McCain develop policy. </p> <p>Davis retains a stake in his firm, but it's not clear whether he'll benefit financially. Though he certainly has an ego interest in keeping the firm alive, the story's not about profit. It's about influence buying.</p> </blockquote> <p>That seems to settle the one question that lingered in my mind. Freddie was putting a down payment on McCain, in essence, by hitching up to Davis' firm. Whether Davis profited directly isn't the point.</p> <p>And just to reiterate, because it's now been probably a couple thousand words since I wrote this this morning, but it's worth repeating: Either Davis lied to or failed to inform McCain about this relationship, or he did inform McCain, and McCain then went out and lied in public on Sunday night.</p> <p>That phrase \"lied in public\" is supposed to pack a punch, but I saw as I was writing it that with regard to this year's John McCain it packs no surprise at all. So let's put it this way. If McCain didn't know of Davis' Freddie deal, then it would appear that McCain went out and knowingly told the truth in public!<br></p>",
  "<p>Rick Davis, the day-to-day manager of John McCain's campaign who is now under scrutiny for his past association with two troubled mortgage companies, has been steeped in Republican presidential politics for nearly 30 years.</p> <p>Davis is a veteran of Ronald Reagan's 1980 and 1984 presidential campaigns and worked in Reagan's White House from 1985 to 1987. In 1988, he helped George Bush Sr's campaign coordinate debates, and managed the 1996 Republican convention for Bob Dole.</p> <p>With that experience, Davis was a sought-after commodity in the run-up to the 2000 race, the most open presidential election in years. He rebuffed offers to work for Dole's wife and North Carolina senator Elizabeth Dole, and early on linked up with McCain, who tapped him to run a committee tasked with gauging support for a White House bid. When McCain officially announced his presidential run late 1999, he named Davis campaign manager.</p> <p>After McCain's first Oval Office run collapsed following primary losses to President Bush, Davis remained close to McCain, serving as chairman of a political action committee the senator founded.</p> <p>In 2001, he was tapped to head the Homeownership Alliance, an advocacy group formed by government-sponsored mortgage company Fannie Mae. The group's goal was to fend off restrictions on its business sought by big banks. Davis's association with the company is at odds with McCain's effort to portray himself as a reformer set to clean up the financial services industry.</p> <p>Along with Paul Manafort, another seasoned Republican presidential strategist, Davis owns Davis Manafort, a consulting firm that has taken in $2.4m since 1999 to lobby the Senate on behalf of telecommunications firms, technology companies and other interests. The company has done consulting work for Fredie Mac. </p> <p>Last summer, Davis was made manager of McCain's campaign after flagging fundraising and support in the polls led the senator to shake up his top staff.</p> <p>Davis began his career in Republican politics in 1979 as a top field operative for the College Republicans. He then worked for the Republican party as a political director overseeing the southern states. After helping a Republican win a Virginia Senate seat in 1981, Davis joined Reagan's team.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain's campaign notched a little-noticed win today as congressional Democrats agreed to allow the US government's 26-year-old ban on oil drilling along the coastlines expire in six days.</p> <p>The Democratic turnaround on coastal drilling marks a stark reversal after months of battling between Barack Obama, who relaxed his opposition to offshore oil rigs over the summer after furious prodding from McCain \u2013 himself a recent convert to the practice.</p> <p>Although the drilling debate dominated the campaign dialog for much of last month, the McCain camp had little to say when Democrats announced late yesterday that their plan to fund the government until next spring would let the drilling ban expire.</p> <p>That silence is proof of the financial markets' sudden rise to the top of the US political agenda, as well as a recent decline in fuel prices. </p> <p>A few Democrats from coastal states, however, openly lamented their party's decision to give ground in the face of a White House veto threat on the funding plan.</p> <p>\"I think it's awful. This battle is not over,\" California senator Dianne Feinstein, an ardent opponent of coastal drilling, said. \"We will come back and fight another day, that's for sure.\"</p> <p>The expired ban is also a symbolic victory in many respects, because years of advance research are required before oil companies can begin building rigs within sight of the American coastlines.</p> <p>Still, McCain's fellow Republicans seized on a chance to claim victory, eagerly reminding voters that a Democratic president is likely to restore the offshore drilling ban in some form.</p> <p>\"With these bans no longer in place, work can begin to allow us to tap into our abundant oil and gas resources \u2014 if our leaders don't lock them back up next year,\" Pete Domenici, the senior Republican on the Senate energy committee, said in a statement.</p> <p>The Obama camp was also silent on the drilling ban, which is slated to expire on October 1 under a funding plan that could become law as soon as tomorrow.</p> <p>Environmental groups had hoped that a widespread ethics scandal at the mineral management service (MMS), the government agency that handles oil-company royalties from drilling, would erode support for new offshore rigs. </p> <p>But news reports of drug use and illicit sex within the MMS were pushed to the sidelines by the failing stock market and ultimately had little effect on political support for coastal drilling.</p> <p>In an apparent effort to accentuate the positive, the Sierra Club released a memo to reporters that urged caution and placed its hope in the next occupant of the White House.</p> <p>\"The moratorium could very well be restored by a new Congress and president who understand that more offshore drilling will do nothing to lower gas prices or solve our energy crisis,\" analysts at the influential environmental group wrote.</p>",
  "<p>A wise wag suggests something that hadn't occurred to me -- maybe it's better from the Obama team's perspective if Rick Davis isn't forced to resign. Here's the thinking:</p> <blockquote> <p>Davis is clearly an albatross...To jettison the campaign manager with 41 days before the election is to go into death-spiral mode. But this is a real dilemma for them: Davis's presence within the campaign allows Obama to get up on stage with McCain three times and personify McCain's role in the current economic crisis as... the man running his campaign. McCain is running for president on his character. Davis ruins everything for him.</p> </blockquote> <p>The \"three times\" refers of course to the debates. Auric Goldfinger turned off that laser beam because he decided Bond was more useful to him alive. Maybe the Obama team is applying similar logic here.</p> <p>By the way: Now that I mention it, I never really understood <em>why </em>Goldfinger decided Bond was worth more to him alive, except that if a laser beam had bifurcated James Bond's penis roughly 40 minutes into the film, we wouldn't have had much of a movie. Does anyone know?<br></p>",
  "<p>Tom Edsall at HuffPo <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/23/rising-conservative-star_n_128789.html\">documents </a>some rising intra-right second thoughts on this issue of Republicans voting en masse, or en demi-masse, against the bailout.</p> <p>The meme was first pushed by conservative blogger Patrick Ruffini, whom Edsall quasi-profiles here. But now other conservatives are saying that the idea isn't so hot after all:</p> <blockquote> <p>In a posting on The Weekly Standard's web site, \"A Time for Grown-ups,\" Dean Barnett wrote \"Patrick Ruffini and I were colleagues at Townhall.com; he's one of the smartest young conservatives on the web. Thus, I found the following blog post he authored utterly dismaying.\"</p> <p>Republican and Democratic Senators, Barnett argues, \"realized that the economy was teetering on the brink of calamity. They knew that if promised government action didn't soothe Wall Street's panic, then partisan concerns would look very small. Moreover, the senators likely knew that if Wall Street perceived the way out of the financial crisis had become a political football, the panic could easily resume.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>From this and other things I've read and seen, including a segment on MSNBC's \"Race to the White House\" Tuesday evening that aimed squarely at the question of whether McCain was behaving responsibly on the bailout question, it now seems that if McCain votes no and grandstands, he likely won't get the kudos for \"independence\" that he may think he's going to get. Monday a \"no\" vote looked like a big win for him. Now, I'd say less so. It would appear that a package may be headed toward a reasonable amount of bipartisan backing. </p> <p>This means that Obama ought to just go ahead and do the responsible thing and vote for it, <em>assuming Chris Dodd and Barney Frank sign off</em>. If McCain votes against a bill with bipartisan support, Obama can say one of us showed leadership and the other one chose to sit on the sidelines, etc., and the MSM will likely buy that.<br></p>",

  "<p>It was almost inevitable that questions over Portsmouth's ownership arose after their 6-0 drubbing at the hands of Manchester City. Most of us would probably be too embarrassed to own up in the aftermath of such a mauling. Alas there was more than just shame at work when the credentials of Pompey's owner, Alexandre Gaydamak, were called into question this week. </p> <p>No, it has nothing to do with the fact that Alexandre was, according to newspaper reports, prepared to sell the club for \u00a360m. Instead, it emerged that all might not be as it seems at Fratton Park after the Israeli tabloid Yedioth Ahronoth published a list of the assets held by Alexandre's father, the effervescent Israeli-Russian billionaire Arkadi Gaydamak. Portsmouth were listed as one of his, and not his son's, concerns. The club and, of course, the family themselves have vehemently denied the allegations, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/sep/23/premierleague.portsmouth\">the Premier League seems satisfied with their explanation</a>. Yet nothing is ever simple when it comes to the Gaydamaks. </p> <p>That sounds a little melodramatic, so let me explain. This is merely the latest in a long line of controversies to surround Arkadi Gaydamak. To start with there is the widely reported French arrest warrant still outstanding for alleged gun running in Angola and tax evasion. But this is only the beginning of the story, one that could end with Gaydamak Snr being elected to one of the most sensitive political posts in the Middle East.</p> <p>Even in Israel, little has been known about the complicated origins of the Gaydamak millions. When Arkadi burst on to the scene three years ago, purchasing Israel's biggest football team Beitar Jerusalem and bankrolling them to a title almost immediately, few questioned where the money came from. </p> <p>\"It is a bit like in England, we don't know a lot about Sacha [Alexandre's nickname],\" said Shaul Adar, an Israeli journalist based in London. \"Does he have any money of his own? How did he get it? He came into the public domain out of nowhere, like his father. Arkadi met [life-long Beitar fan Ehud] Olmert. He asked to donate money, and the next day he was the owner [of Beitar]. In the few months he was the most famous person in Israel, he was on TV all the time and he came over quite eccentric. He was the Israeli Abramovich.\" </p> <p>Beitar has dominated Israeli football ever since but that wasn't enough. Arkadi had political ambitions, setting up his own Social Justice party and announcing he was to stand in the November 11 Jerusalem mayoral election. His outspoken, maverick persona has more than a touch of the John McCain about it: a right-wing populist that can spring the odd surprise, indulge in some political madness and provoke grudging admiration all at the same time. His purchase of Beitar, who arguably boast one of the most racist terraces in world football, immediately hoisted his flag for the political right. This, after all, was a team whose fans regularly sung songs wishing 'death to the Arabs' whilst refusing to accept an Arab playing for the club. </p> <p>Yet he was also responsible for donating money to the Israeli Arab football team Bnei Sakhnin when they were close to going under after relegation from the Ligat Ha'al. Sakhnin's chairman Mazen Genaim told me that Gaydamak was \"a great man\". It was his money that stopped the team going bankrupt. Indeed, he even tried to sign an Arab player, Abbas Suan, but the Beitar faithful weren't ready and rioted. </p> <p>Last season Gaydamak became increasingly exasperated by his fans' behaviour, first for continually singing racist chants, then for whistling through a minute's silence to mark the assassination of Labor prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, then when a group of Beitar's fans trashed the Israeli FA's offices in Tel Aviv and daubed death threats on its walls, and then, finally, for the two-point penalty that followed a pitch invasion in last season's title decider. </p> <p>\"The idiot bastards can leave,\" Gaydamak said of the hardcore troublemakers at his club. \"The fans that went wild yesterday are bastards, and I have no respect for them. While their numbers are in the thousands, they are not the majority.\" He has even had his own 'Palin moment', stating his desire to appoint an Arab deputy mayor if he is elected, a move that would do more than any other candidate to engage East Jerusalem's reticent Palestinian population.</p> <p>Then there's the philanthropy. Gaydamak has sunk millions of shekels into schemes that have seen him outmanoeuvre established political foes. When the town of Sderot on the Israeli/Gaza border came under a barrage of rocket attacks in the spring of 2007, Olmert, who had by now fallen out with Arkadi, got the mood of the nation totally wrong, insisting that its residents should sit tight and weather the storm. Any evacuation, he reasoned, would be a propaganda gift for Hamas. </p> <p>With graphic pictures showing the residents of Sderot cowering in their basements gripping the Israeli public, Gaydamak had other ideas and rode to the rescue, setting up a luxury tent city in Tel Aviv's Hayarkan Park and laying on buses to evacuate all those who feared for their lives. The camp was staffed with gourmet chefs, tents with Playstation 2s for the kids to play on, and a nightly cabaret. The staff liberally handed out black and gold Beitar scarves. Even earlier this month he paid $13,500 out of his own pocket for the medical treatment of a Palestinian man who had a heart attack during Friday prayers at Al Aqsa Mosque. </p> <p>And then there's the madness. Gaydamak has always been known for his sharp tongue \u2013 he once described Olmert as 'stupid' \u2013 but he outdid himself last month when he declared his opinion on whether the annual Jerusalem Gay Pride march, which has become a pivotal cause for the religious right in the city, would go ahead on his watch. \"They want to be proud? They're allowed to. They want to demonstrate? Fine,\" he stated at a press conference. \"But the streets of Jerusalem are a symbol, and parading on them would be an aggressive act against our tradition, against our values and against our morale. I would lie on the ground in order to block the march and would even die before I approve the pride parade in the city.\"</p> <p>Of course, this can all be explained by political expediency. The ownership of Beitar, or at least being a staunch fan, has been seen in the past as, if not a gateway into politics, then certainly a way of courting a sizeable chunk of Likud-leaning voters for everyone from Netanyahu to Olmert. Aligning the religious right on both sides of Jerusalem is also a clever way of finding common ground between two seemingly paradoxical constituencies: the sanctity of Jerusalem as a religious totem for Jews, Muslims and Christians, where issues like gay pride marches would have both Imams and Rabbis spluttering into their dainty cups of mint tea. </p> <p>Already he has sought counsel from the Mufti of Jerusalem and the Vatican. The desire to give the outgoing prime minister Olmert, one of the most unpopular politicians in Israel's history, a bloody nose and appear to be a safe pair of hands in times of crisis is self-explanatory. Whether this is enough for Gaydamak to persuade a majority of Jerusalemites to vote for him is probably unlikely. Despite currently polling third, and some reports from Israel suggest he may even be looking for a way out rather than face the prospect of finishing last, his camp maintain that their man can spring a surprise by concentrating on his right-wing religious core. The problem is that as the elections near, more unflattering reports emerge. Suddenly the Israeli Abramovich's pockets don't seem so deep anymore. </p> <p>\"When he did his business in Russia and Angola he didn't have to declare how he did it [made his fortune],\" Adar explained. \"But as soon as he bought Israeli companies he had to announce it at the stock exchange. It turns out he is a worse businessman than me! Arkadi is not doing well in the past year.\" </p> <p>Even his formally loyal Beitar fans that used to fill the Teddy Stadium with choruses of 'Arkadi is the Messiah' have started to desert him. This season has so far been a shambles. With two points docked for bad behaviour and the team knocked out of Champions League qualification after an embarrassing 5-0 capitulation to Wislaw Krakow, the side drew 0-0 with arch-rivals Bnei Sakhnin in the opening game of the season. Arkadi responded by sacking not only the manager, but also almost all of the non-playing staff, even the press spokesman. </p> <p>But the turning point was the next game, another 0-0 draw with the equally despised Maccabi Tel Aviv. \"Beitar got a penalty in the 90th minute,\" recalled Adar. \"[Shimon] Gershon took it and missed and on TV you could see him [Arkadi] shouting in Russian 'Why Gershon, why?' And after that he said [in a press conference] 'Why does the coach not get rid of Gershon?' That is when the penny dropped [with Beitar fans] that he is not very good at being in charge of a football club.\"</p> <p>Still, the big prize is the mayoralty of Jerusalem, one of Israel's, if not the Middle East's, most important jobs. It's hard to think of a more divided city, split as it is religiously, culturally and politically. It's a tense place, made tenser by the spate of Palestinian ram raids which seem to have replaced the suicide bomb as the last-resort weapon of choice, where one wrong move can ignite latent hatreds. The mayor has powers over boundaries and building permits, both politically explosive issues for the Palestinians in East Jerusalem who feel they are being slowly 'built out' of their neighbourhoods to skew the demographics in favour of the city's Jewish population. It takes a deft hand, one which many feel he just doesn't have. For evidence, look no further than the goings-on at Beitar this season. </p> <p>\"In three years he has sacked six coaches, fired the entire top-level management team and replaced the third chairman in three years with the club's former goalkeeper Itzik Korenfein,\" explained Jeremy Last, sports editor at the Jerusalem Post. \"His charitable work could be seen as showing that he cares about the Israeli people but it is also an indication of his political attitude. A year ago he admitted in a television documentary on him that he hoped people would support him politically because of the charitable work he has done. The majority of Jerusalemites do not want a mayor who will go on a sacking spree the minute things go wrong. Besides the concerns about his management style, Gaydamak quite clearly has no political experience.\" </p> <p>But the biggest barrier of all may be the fact that Gaydamak will quite literally not be truly able to understand his coveted constituency. \"He barely speaks any Hebrew, a fact which creates a barrier between himself and both his co-workers and his voters,\" Last continued. \"He insists the language barrier is not an issue, but it is hard to imagine how he will be able to sit in city council meetings when he won't be able to understand what is being said.\" November 11 will see whether his philanthropy and wrapping himself in the black and gold of Beitar will pay off. If it doesn't Arkadi will no doubt be looking for a new challenge in pastures new. I hear there's a decent, mid-sized Premier League team for sale on the south coast. Yours, Arkadi, for just \u00a360m.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/When-Friday-Comes-Football-Zone/dp/1845963695\">When Friday Comes: Football in the War Zone</a> (Mainstream/Random House) by James Montague is out now</em></p>",
  "<p>At a <a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/\">Progress</a> fringe meeting this week, Labour delegates in Manchester examined the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/london08\">London elections last May</a> with a mixture of pain and pleasure. The pain was of course in the loss of the mayoralty, and the resulting self-criticism of the language, tactics and apparent deafness to the concerns of many white and outer London voters. The pleasure was in the gain of an assembly seat, and in what was generally acclaimed as a professionally organised campaign that had got activists enthusiastic in a way that is unusual in Labour politics (and contrasted with the paralysis of the will that prevails this week in Manchester).</p> <p>As well as the surface politics of the London elections, there were some intriguing fragments of information in which deeper currents could be glimpsed, provided by Ben Page of the polling organisation Ipsos-Mori. These left me thinking as much about the Conservatives as Labour. </p> <p>Ipsos-Mori's research on local government suggest that levels of \"unhappiness\" \u2013 fear of crime, dissatisfaction with local services and the council's record, and a perception of dirt and squalor \u2013 are highest in the outer London boroughs, with Croydon and Harrow leading the way. People in inner London seem by contrast relatively happy with their lot. </p> <p>As early as 2002, the Conservatives under Iain Duncan Smith did relatively well in some outer London boroughs, regaining Barnet, Redbridge and Enfield. Their campaign in these boroughs tapped into a sense that the areas were in decline, becoming more inner city and chaotic. It would be inaccurate to see this merely as a coded appeal to racism, although no doubt susceptible voters did hear a dog-whistle. The main aim was more about tapping into a sense of a lost dream among London suburban voters of a clean, green place with families living in large houses, good public services and a sense of (perhaps stifling) social order. In voting Conservative in local elections in 2002 and 2006, and in such numbers for Boris Johnson in 2008, suburbanites (including the working class suburbanites of Dagenham, and other outer London council-built areas) are saying that they do not like the current state of their suburbs very much, and haven't felt that Labour cares very much about it.</p> <p>While many suburban voters feel that they are losing what they initially found attractive in their communities, inner Londoners have often made a conscious choice to come to a place that fits their aspirations. This applies to the people who have come from all over the world to live and work in London, and for instance to the affluent inhabitants of Camden Town or Islington who prefer urban life to the calm of the suburbs. This in turn displaces people who would like to live in inner London, but cannot afford it (recent immigrants and the young) further out to cheaper suburban areas. Population turnover is so high in the inner city that people, to some extent, are sorted into places that suit them. The same is not true of the suburbs, where older established voters (including those who moved there as recently as the 1990s) have seen their areas change before their eyes. In Bexley and Bromley, which turned in a massive vote for Johnson in 2008, there has been anxiety about ending up like Croydon or Lewisham. </p> <p>Urban politics in a city on the scale of London messy and complicated. The task of maintaining a complicated rainbow coalition of competing interests without alienating any of them, or indeed arousing too much reaction from the white working and middle classes, is a tricky job to pull off, and the strains were clearly showing in Ken Livingstone's second term with rows over the London Development Agency's policies, Lee Jasper and Yusuf al-Qaradawi among others. London is, after all, still majority white and majority suburban, and assembling a winning vote for Labour on this basis is tricky. Livingstone and the Labour Assembly group pioneered some interesting new political approaches \u2013 in the first term, with Livingstone governing as an Independent, and in the second term with the City Hall alliance of Labour and Green facilitated by the proportional electoral system. Labour needs some new political skills \u2013 an inclusive, coalition-building approach and the ditching of old ambitions of monolithic control \u2013 to manage it.</p> <p>There is no long term future for the Conservatives in a politics of suburban backlash. Little can be done about the broad trends, and by winning local elections a party becomes part of the perceived problem rather than part of the solution. The Conservatives now control most suburban boroughs, and in 2006 there was a swing to Labour in Enfield and a mediocre result in Barnet \u2013 four years of Tory control had not slowed the rate of change much. The Conservatives run Croydon, Merton and Harrow after the 2006 elections and it would not be surprising if they underperform in 2010.</p> <p>But there is an alternative. The Republicans have won every New York mayoral election since 1993 with a formula of fiscal discipline, tough language (and achievement) on reducing crime, efficiency and social tolerance, and to some extent this has been a winning Conservative formula in the inner London boroughs like Westminster, Wandsworth and Kensington &amp; Chelsea which they control. But New York remains a very left-wing city in all other elections from president to borough council, and the fact remains that there is huge tension between what is needed to win in New York and the nature of the wider Republican Party. <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.beb0d8fdaa9e1607a62fa24601c789a0/\">Michael Bloomberg</a>, after all, was always a pretty nominal Republican and went independent in 2007. Perhaps there is something structural, as well as personal, in the speculation about a rift between Johnson and Cameron, but these are early days and it may take Tory control at both national and London level to reveal the potential for division.</p>",
  "<p>A consulting firm owned by John McCain's campaign manager accepted large fees from a mortgage company at the centre of the financial crisis ripping through Wall Street, according to reports today.</p> <p>A firm led by Rick Davis, a long-time McCain aide and chief of the Republican candidate's day-to-day campaign, received payments totalling $500,000 between the end of 2005 and last month from Freddie Mac, according to the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/us/politics/24davis.html?ex=1379995200&amp;en=c683f46019847144&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink\">New York Times</a> and others this morning. </p> <p>The reports appear to directly contradict comments by McCain at the weekend. Asked in an interview about ties between Davis and the mortgage giants, McCain responded that Davis, \"has had nothing to do with it since, and I'll be glad to have his record examined by anybody who wants to look at it\".</p> <p>Freddie Mac was taken over by the federal government this month, along with fellow mortgage giant Fannie Mae, as credit markets froze and threatened the health of the US economy.</p> <p>McCain and Barack Obama have sparred over ties to lobbying firms and financial institutions caught up in the Wall Street turmoil. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae both had long histories of aggressive lobbying to fend off government restrictions on their business.</p> <p>The McCain campaign has run advertisements saying Obama takes housing advice from Frank Raines, a former Fannie Mae chief executive, a link the Obama campaign denies.</p> <p>Citing two anonymous sources, the New York Times said Davis did not do much work for Freddie Mac, other than to address a meeting of high-level employees in October 2006, and was paid $15,000 per month. Davis took a leave from his company, Davis Manafort, to work for McCain's presidential campaign, but as an owner still holds an equity stake in the firm.</p> <p>Today, Davis skipped a regular luncheon with reporters sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor newspaper, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.</p> <p>A top aide to the Obama campaign this morning suggested that Freddie Mac had paid Davis merely to gain access to McCain. \"It is now clear that both John McCain and Rick Davis did not tell the truth about Davis's continuing financial relationship with Freddie Mac, one of the actors at the centre of this financial crisis,\" said Dan Pfeiffer, communications director to the campaign. \"It's troubling not only that Davis's firm\u2014with which he is still associated and which the McCain campaign paid directly last year\u2014continued to be compensated by Freddie Mac until as recently as last month, but that the firm did little work and apparently was being paid simply to provide access to the McCain campaign.\"</p> <p>On Monday, the New York Times reported that Davis received an additional $30,000 to $35,000 per month as president of the Homeownership Alliance, an organisation controlled by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac aimed at combating government efforts to restrict their business. When that organisation dissolved, Freddie Mac began paying Davis Manafort.</p> <p>The McCain campaign did not dispute the payments to Davis Manafort, but this morning released a long attack on the legitimacy of the New York Times article.</p> <p>\"Today the New York Times launched its latest attack on this campaign in its capacity as an Obama advocacy organization,\" the statement began. </p> <p>It continued: \"Therefore this 'report' from the New York Times must be evaluated in the context of its intent and purpose. It is a partisan attack falsely labelled as objective news. And its most serious allegations are based entirely on the claims of anonymous sources, a familiar yet regretful tactic for the paper.\"</p>",

The McCain campaign's <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/09/23/no_print_media_allowed_as_pali.html\">efforts</a> to keep reporters away from Palin at the United Nations yesterday meant that all anyone heard of her meeting with Hamid Karzai, the president of Afghanistan, was <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0908/Pool_Report_29_seconds_with_Palin_and_Karzai.html\">precisely this</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"What is his name?\" Palin asked [of Karzai's son].<br>\"Mirwais,\" Mr. Karzai replied. \"Mirwais, which means, 'The Light of the House.'\"<br>\"Oh nice,\" Palin responded.</p> </blockquote> <p>Nice \u2014&#xa0;but not as nice as it would have been if Karzai had run the name \"Mirwais\" through the <a href=\"http://politsk.blogspot.com/2008/09/sarah_13.html\">Sarah Palin Baby Name Generator</a>, in which case he'd have called his son Strike Chipper Palin.</p> <p>UPDATE: Read the comments on this thread, starting at 6.00, <strong>doobop</strong>'s at 7.27 especially \u2014&#xa0;hilarious.<br></p>",
  "<p>The McCain camp has released a looooong <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/mccain-memo-on-the-ny-times/\">statement </a>in response to the Rick Davis stories (actually, it fires back only at the Times). </p> <p>Notable points: first, its length. When a campaign issues a statement this long in response to a news story, it's worried.</p> <p>Second, its over-the-top rhetoric about the Times pursuing its liberal agenda through its news pages. In fact the Times has reported extensively on Obama's \"present\" votes in Illinois (it broke that very negative story) and other matters. The Obama camp sent out this email to supporters yesterday:</p> <blockquote> <p># of probing stories the NY Times has written over the course of the campaign about Barack Obama, his life, his religion, his childhood, his politics, his time in the state senate, his time in the U.S. Senate, his family, his religion, his friends, his fundraising and all other manner of associations: more than 40 (see below)</p> <p># of stories the NY Times has written over the course of the campaign about the last major financial regulatory crisis, resulting in a huge bailout, and which John McCain was centrally involved in with his political godfather Charles Keating: 0</p> </blockquote> <p>Obviously, not all of those 40 are highly negative or deeply investigative. The truth here is somewhere in the middle, and while it's obvious that the Times is liberal on its editorial page and will certainly endorse Obama, in its news pages it tries to be fair. Conservatives of course expect that news outlets are supposed to over-compensate for reality, and that failure to do so is evidence of \"liberal bias.\" So if Republican politician A has 10 lobbyists on his payroll and Democratic pol B has two, that's supposed to be a \"both sides do it\" story, even though one side does it five times as egregiously as the other side.</p> <p>Now, as to the substance of the McCain critique.</p> <p>The heart of the pushback is in these two grafs:</p> <blockquote> <p>In fact, the allegation is demonstrably false. As has been previously reported, Mr. Davis separated from his consulting firm, Davis Manafort, in 2006. As has been previously reported, Mr. Davis has seen no income from Davis Manafort since 2006. Zero. Mr. Davis has received no salary or compensation since 2006. Mr. Davis has received no profit or partner distributions from that firm on any basis \u2014 weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual \u2014 since 2006. Again, zero. Neither has Mr. Davis received any equity in the firm based on profits derived since his financial separation from Davis Manafort in 2006.</p> <p>Further, and missing from the Times' reporting, Mr. Davis has never \u2014 never \u2014 been a lobbyist for either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Mr. Davis has not served as a registered lobbyist since 2005.</p> </blockquote> <p>OK, that looks pretty persuasive, perhaps. So let's go back and re-read the Times story in light of the McCain counter-charges.</p> <p>Statement: \"Davis separated from his consulting firm in 2006.\"<br>Times: \"Mr. Davis took a leave from Davis Manafort for the presidential campaign\" (no date given).</p> <p>Statement: \"Mr. Davis has seen no income from Davis Manafort since 2006. Zero. Mr. Davis has received no salary or compensation since 2006. Mr. Davis has received no profit or partner distributions from that firm on any basis \u2014 weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual \u2014 since 2006. Again, zero. Neither has Mr. Davis received any equity in the firm based on profits derived since his financial separation from Davis Manafort in 2006.\"<br>Times: \"\u2026as an equity holder [Davis] continues to benefit from its income.\"</p> <p>On point one, the statement doesn't really contradict the Times (one can perhaps fault the Times for not mentioning the year, but that's a detail). On point two, the statement directly contradicts the paper's assertion that Davis continues to benefit from the firm's income. So somebody is right here and somebody isn't. Unless maybe it's somehow all more financially complicated than that.</p> <p>At any rate, the Times story makes another germane point: </p> <blockquote> <p>They said they did not recall Mr. Davis's doing much substantive work for the company in return for the money, other than to speak to a political action committee of high-ranking employees in October 2006 on the approaching midterm Congressional elections. They said Mr. Davis's firm, Davis Manafort, had been kept on the payroll because of his close ties to Mr. McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, who by 2006 was widely expected to run again for the White House\u2026</p> <p>\u2026No one at Davis Manafort other than Mr. Davis was involved in efforts on Freddie Mac's behalf, the people familiar with the arrangement said.</p> </blockquote> <p>In other words, this suggests that Freddie hired the firm, whether Davis was still officially tied to it or not, specifically because of Rick Davis, and ultra-specifically because of Rick Davis' ties to McCain, who was known to be preparing to run for president again. </p> <p>Pending the resolution of point two, I say the scales weigh in on the side of the Times right now.</p> <p>Finally -- a serious question here is whether the Times is going to let itself be cowed by this kind of thing. The headline on the statement is \"A partisan paper of record.\" Fox and all kinds of howlers are going to pick that up. Bill Keller needs to stand tall here.</p>",
  "<p>Mark Kleiman has some interesting responses to the McCain campaign's attempt to use the entire city of Chicago and state of Illinois as fodder against Obama.</p> <p>Go read <a href=\"http://www.samefacts.com/archives/john_mccain_/2008/09/hardball.php\">the post</a>, which includes what Kleiman says is the mug shot of Jim Hensley, the father-in-law of John McCain, taken at the time of his arrest in 1948 (he was later convicted of some federal bootlegging and related counts, and received a fine and a suspended sentence). All rather amusing. <br></p>",
  "<p>When the McCain campaign released the bad news it had accumulated in its post-haste vetting of Sarah Palin, it did so all at once, during the holiday weekend at the end of last month. They chose this strategy, as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/02/us/politics/02assess.html\">one key campaign adviser promised a New York Times reporter</a>, \"to flush the toilet.\"</p> <p>And what a toilet it is. Just to pick one of the examples that actually relates to the issue of Palin's mode of governance \u2013 the ostensible reason she was chosen to be a heartbeat away from the presidency by a man with a 72-year-old ticker \u2013 is to enter a political and ethical looking-glass that makes Whitewater-era Arkansas appear to be a mirage of high-minded, almost Platonic public service. But while Whitewater obsessed Washington's journalists for almost a decade and led ultimately to the impeachment of an enormously popular president, 2008's version of <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2200414\">Troopergate</a> has failed to inspire much in the way of outrage or even media interest.</p> <p>Despite any number of attempts to obscure them, the <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iT8pcyCcfWAEBpugJsgWD1CRsgSgD93AJUD00\">facts of the matter</a>, while complicated, are also clear. Last July, Palin demanded of Alaska's public safety commissioner, Walt Monegan - whom she had appointed to the job - that he fire her ex-brother-in-law, Mike Wooten, from his post as a state trooper. (Wooten was, at the time, in divorce proceedings with the governor's sister.) A formal investigation of Wooten was undertaken, with the result that he was briefly suspended from his job - a punishment that did little to satisfy Palin. At one point Monegan felt forced to warn the governor's husband Todd Palin: \"You can't head-hunt like this. What you need to do is back off, because if the trooper does make a mistake, and it is a terminable offense, it can look like political interference.\"</p> <p>Unable to get what she wanted, Sarah Palin fired Monegan, without offering much in the way of a cause or an explanation. Monegan soon fought back with his story of public pressure over a private matter. The apparent capriciousness of Palin's action led to an <a href=\"http://www.newsminer.com/news/2008/jul/28/lawmakers-formally-call-investigation-palins-publi/\">investigation by a bipartisan panel</a> in Alaska's legislature. At that point, Palin complained that Monegan had not been a \"team player on budgeting issues,\" and created <a href=\"http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_stump/archive/2008/09/23/ap-palin-abuses-power-in-abuse-of-power-inquiry.aspx\">her own investigation</a> inside the Alaska attorney-general's office.</p> <p>This <a href=\"http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/palin_under_fire_at_home_for_t.php\">backfired</a>, however, when the attorney-general's office found that Palin's record was at odds with her public statements. In fact, members of her staff had sought Wooten's firing and - according to a recent report in the Washington Post - both Palin and her husband personally participated in the campaign to oust him.</p> <p>The Palins' <a href=\"http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/i-call-for-the.html\">new tactic</a> appears to be to try to shut down any investigation by virtue of <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/19/palin.investigation/\">non-cooperation</a>. Key witnesses have ignored subpoenas, including the Palins themselves. They have attacked Monegan both personally and politically. As the <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/opinion/story/529587.html\">Anchorage Daily News complained</a>: \"Palin and McCain are trying to ignite a partisan firestorm that wipes out the Troopergate investigation until after the [presidential] election.\"</p> <p>This may not be possible, as the Alaska legislature is <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1843678,00.html?imw=Y\">planning</a> to issue its report \u2013 as originally promised \u2013 by October 31. Whether this strategy of non-cooperation, disparagement and, by all appearances, dishonesty, will work as an effective cover-up strategy will depend on how interested the rest of the mainstream media remains in the story, and how well <a href=\"http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/092108/sta_334953142.shtml\">the McCain team's strategy</a> of attacking all media institutions works.</p> <p>It's hard to believe that America might actually be even more dishonestly, ineffectually and ideologically governed after January 20, 2009 than before it. But the Palin/Troopergate story, like so much of the tone and tenor of the McCain campaign post-nomination, offers ample evidence for just such a nightmare scenario.</p>",

The McCain campaign had tried to keep journalists out, initially insisting just a few photographers and one television camera could attend. </p> <p>This caused a furore among the press and the campaign team had to back down when CNN, the pool camera crew, <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/09/23/media-presses-mccain-campaign-for-access-to-palin-meeting/\">threatened to boycott</a> the whole event. </p> <p>Still, the <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/23/media-rebellion-over-palin-photo-ops/\">New York Times' political blog</a> mocked that all it could glean from her meeting with Karzai was that she thought the name of his young son, Mirwais, which means \"the light of the house\", was \"nice\".</p> <p>Gordon Brown is due to arrive in New York later today. But having caused ire among the Republican campaign for indicating that he <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/09/10/uk-prime-minister-brown-denies-obama-bias \">supported Barrack Obama's candidacy</a>, he is unlikely to get an audience. </p> <p>Palin's lineup is not just world leaders in suits. U2's frontman, Bono, will also be offering his thoughts on international relations to the pro-hunting anti-abortionist. </p> <p>Can she really learn much from these short meetings?

Two weeks ago, in the wake of the Republican national convention, McCain had a two-point lead after a bounce attributed to the strong performance of his running mate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a>.</p> <p>The latest poll shows that 52% of voters view Palin positively but her unfavourable rating has gone up 10 points, from 28% to 38%.</p> <p>Financial uncertainty weighed heavily on voters' minds, with 9% rating the economy as good or excellent - the lowest rating since before the 1992 election. The results suggest Obama is favoured to lead the country through economic turmoil.</p> <p>When asked who they trusted to handle the economy, 53% said Obama and 39% said McCain. Two weeks ago, Obama's lead on the issue was five points. Independents have given Obama a 21-point lead on the economy, the highest since campaigning began. </p> <p>The economy was cited as the most important issue by 50% of respondents, up from 37% two weeks ago. Since the last poll, Lehman Brothers has gone into bankruptcy and the US treasury has intervened to save other investment banks and the insurance company AIG. </p> <p>Nine per cent of voters identified the war in Iraq as the most important issue in the election. This is the lowest percentage so far.</p> <p>Obama has made substantial inroads into McCain's advantages on handling Iraq, international affairs and dealing with terrorism.

  "<p>Interesting <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13818.html\">piece </a>by Marcus Stern in the Politico which seems to move the ball down the field on the bridge to nowhere story. Palin supported it far longer than she's acknowledged, even after members of Congress -- including John McCain! -- started making fun of it:</p> <blockquote> <p>Palin was campaigning for the votes of Alaskans who wanted the bridge and who felt aggrieved by all the criticism it had attracted. The shirt's message said she was one of them, not one of those critics who didn't even know the local ZIP code. This was tiny Ketchikan, the \"nowhere\" to be reached by the bridge \u2014 or as the T-shirt defiantly proclaimed, this was \"NOWHERE ALASKA 99901.\" </p> <p>Just in case there was any doubt about her position, Palin \u2014 who grew up in Alaska's Matanuska-Susitna Valley \u2014 used some local slang, declaring, \"OK, you've got valley trash standing here in the middle of nowhere. I think we're going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>\"Progress\" that project? Never mind. And there's this:</p> <blockquote> <p>During a televised debate, she was asked if she would cancel a contract to build an access road on Gravina Island intended as a connector to the bridge. </p> <p>\"I'm not going to stand in the way of progress,\" she replied. </p> <p>During the debate, her opponent, independent Andrew Halcro, shot back, \"I'm not in favor of standing in the way of progress either, but this isn't progress. This is a road to a bridge that will never be built.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>The next time you hear someone say, \"yeah, but everyone from state X supports wasteful boondoggles,\" you can tell them that everyone doesn't, and Andrew Halcro did not.<br></p>",

  "<p>The Lloyds TSB takeover of HBOS continues to confound city analysts and pundits alike. When news hit the wires that HBOS was in deep trouble and lawyers and advisers had been spotted scuttling between the UK Treasury and the Financial Services Authority, the establishment moved fast. One early morning last week commentators in live interviews began to speculate on what impact the deal would have on the jittery economy, and what the prospect of 40,000 job losses would mean to the city.</p> <p>But where did the figure of 40,000 come from? The number was bandied about by analysts as soon as it was transmitted live on <a href=\"http://uk.news.yahoo.com/skynews/20080918/tbs-bank-rescue-deal-to-be-confirmed-327c223.html\">Sky News</a>, and was front page news for the Times and other newspapers. A senior banker, it was claimed, had estimated that 40,000 jobs would be lost in the takeover deal. But we should be suspicious of such a perfectly round number. At best it could only have been an intelligent guess at the time of the interview \u2013 details about the takeover were still being published late on into the day. At worst it was a wild stab in the dark by a senior banker who was either deliberately inflating the number (so the final number of job losses didn't look so painful) or most likely it was plucked out of the ether, a meme carried over the hot air and desperation from Wall Street. Whatever the case, it turns out the number 40,000 is rather popular when it comes to potential job losses.</p> <p>In January this year Royal Mail began a round of cost-cutting measures as part of its modernisation programme that unions feared would trigger <a href=\"http://uk.news.yahoo.com/skynews/20080918/tbs-bank-rescue-deal-to-be-confirmed-327c223.html\">40,000 job losses</a>. A couple of months later in the US there were fears that <a href=\"http://www.ourfuture.org/merci-mccain\">40,000 manufacturing jobs</a> could go to France if Airbus won a highly controversial contract to supply the department of defence with a new air-refuelling tanker. In the same month the economist Brian Bethune suggested as many as 40,000 jobs could be cut from US payrolls. In April analysts at <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2008/04/15/afx4891317.html\">JP Morgan</a> said job losses in the City could be around 40,000, which was double the figure first feared. Interestingly, this was later described as a worst-case scenario and questions were raised over the size of the potential loss. The 40,000 meme was soon found in Berlin where it was reported this summer that Deutsche Bahn, Germany's state-owned rail operator, would shed up to <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2986972.stm\">40,000 workers</a> in an effort to boost efficiency. The following month it was announced that 40,000 jobs in the private sector had been lost <a href=\"http://www.urbanohio.com/forum2/index.php?topic=16651.0\">in Ohio</a> since 2000. Early this month the governor of New York state said Wall Street might lay off 40,000 workers following the recent turbulence in the markets. In Italy, it's been reported that bringing back single teachers for primary school classes means <a href=\"http://www.anarkismo.net/article/9848\">40,000 jobs</a> will be wiped out. </p> <p>If you Google 40,000 now, you will find that more than <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/News/Ontario/article/503930\">40,000 plants</a> were seized after Canadian police raided a 40-plus-hectare farm in Laurentian Valley Township, just outside Pembroke last Thursday, while <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2008/09/23/40-000-trees-will-be-liverpool-s-culture-legacy-100252-21881107/\">40,000 trees</a> could be planted in Liverpool to create a new forest. Some of these figures may turn out to be true, most will be wide of the mark. </p> <p>As the author Dan Gardner suggests, psychologists have demonstrated time and again that it is almost impossible to keep bogus statistics from worming their way into our brains and influencing our judgment. It may turn out that the senior banker was right in his estimation that 40,000 jobs will be lost as a result of the takeover of HBOS. But it's much more likely that 40,000 was already etched into his brain and in the turmoil of City life he plucked it out without even thinking.</p>",
  "<p>Mark this day down. Today \u2013 last night, actually \u2013 the New York Times and Roll Call reported (it's hard to see who was first) what may be the biggest political story of the campaign. How big? John McCain might have to fire his campaign manager. Big enough?</p> <p>The story is this. The lobbying firm of Rick Davis, the manager, was being paid $15,000 a month by Freddie Mac until last month. That fact is a direct contradiction of words McCain had spoken Sunday night. At that time, responding to a Times story being prepared for Monday's paper revealing that Davis had been the head of a lobbying consortium led by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae until 2005, McCain said Davis had done no further work for either mortgage giant.</p> <p>Someone's lying \u2013 either Davis to McCain, or McCain to the public. I trust you see the problem here.</p> <p>The stories are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/us/politics/24davis.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;hp&amp;adxnnlx=1222254510-sUiaCiHGAJvqdIlpeo2v%20g\">here</a>, by David Kirkpatrick (whose reporting on this topic has been leading the way) and Jackie Calmes of the Times, and <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/28629-1.html?type=printer_friendly\">here</a>, by Tory Newmeyer of Roll Call. You should definitely read every word of both. I think after you do you'll agree that, depending on how big the pick-up is today and how hard the Obama camp presses this, it's pretty difficult to see how Davis can stay on as campaign manager. </p> <p>The revelations are devastating for two reasons. First, as I noted above, either Davis lied to McCain or McCain lied to the voters. From the Times story:</p> <blockquote> <p>On Sunday, in an interview with CNBC and The Times, Mr. McCain responded to a question about that tie between Mr. Davis and the two mortgage companies by saying that he \"has had nothing to do with it since, and I'll be glad to have his record examined by anybody who wants to look at it.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Who lied to whom? This is the kind of thing we might not know for a while, or maybe never. My hunch would be that Davis concealed it from McCain and that McCain, as is his wont, just winged it Sunday night, without really caring whether it was true, because that's what he does. But let me clearly label that a hunch. I don't know. But it doesn't really matter.</p> <p>The second reason this is devastating is maybe even bigger than the question of the Sunday lie, which is limited in scope after all to a sort of narrow legal question. The second reason is that McCain has been going around putting lobbyists, specifically for F &amp; F, at the heart of the whole problem. This is from the Roll Call piece:</p> <blockquote> <p>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac emerged as issues in the presidential race last week because of turmoil in the financial markets. In a radio address from Green Bay, Wis., on Saturday, McCain blamed the companies and their political clout for creating the housing mess now roiling Wall Street. \"At the center of the problem were the lobbyists, politicians and bureaucrats who succeeded in persuading Congress and the administration to ignore the festering problems at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,'' he said. \"Using money and influence, they prevented reforms that would have curbed their power and limited their ability to damage our economy. And now, as ever, the American taxpayers are left to pay the price for Washington's failure.''</p> </blockquote> <p>I just can't picture any way of wiggling out of that. He is talking in those sentences about his own campaign manager! And he's going to be able to keep him on? Strange things happen all the time, but I have trouble seeing it.</p> <p>Oh and by the way: No wonder Steve Schmidt, another top McCain strategist, said on a Monday conference call with reporters that \"Whatever The New York Times once was, it is today not by any standard a journalistic organization.\" He obviously knew that more was coming and was trying to lay some discrediting groundwork.</p> <p>This is a terrible, terrible story for McCain, and yes, the biggest political story of the general-election campaign so far.<br></p>",
  "<p>A straw poll of senior transport industry figures this morning suggests that Ruth Kelly, who has now set her satnav for the backbenches, did a good job in her 15 months as transport secretary. </p> <p>An aviation executive said: \"Sorry to see her going.\" A prominent green activist said: \"She has done a lot of good things.\" A bus and rail group executive added: \"It is a blow that she is going.\" And a motoring campaigner, not an obvious candidate for supporting Labour ministers, said: \"She had started to address the problem of congestion on our motorways.\"</p> <p>Ruth Kelly built this coalition on a very New Labour pick-and-mix of policy approaches, hovering between being pro-green and then pro-airport expansion, between the heavy hand of government and then letting the private sector have a big role in running public transport. </p> <p>That coalition was built by: signalling her support for a third runway at Heathrow, steering through a rail white paper that left private ownership of rail franchises and the overall structure of the industry untouched, introducing a concessionary bus fare scheme that allowed over-60s to travel the UK for free, and deftly sidelining a national road pricing scheme for at least the term of this government. </p> <p>And with the vehemently anti-pay-as-you-drive Tories likely to win the next election, that means road pricing is off the agenda for a while yet.</p> <p>But do not mistake those compliments or lists of achievements from all sectors of the transport world for a consensus that Ruth Kelly had a coherent vision for Britain's transport needs. </p> <p>The attempt to stamp a broader framework on transport policy - Towards a Sustainable Transport System, published 13 months ago - had its green hue rather tarnished by a consultation on Heathrow airport that reiterated support for a third runway at Britain's busiest airport. </p> <p>Also, the concessionary fares scheme is admirable in intent - transport executives, used to being in the background at party conferences, were thrilled that Gordon Brown mentioned it in his speech - but a significant number of bus operators, local councils and, apparently, Department for Transport officials, believe it has a glaring funding gap.</p> <p>So, let's give those straw poll respondents' views a bit more air. </p> <p>Stephen Joseph, the executive director of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: \"Ruth Kelly has done a lot of good things, but she has been an apostle for airport expansion. It just seems so odd that her espousal of low-carbon transport has been combined with such a gung-ho attitude towards building more runways.\" </p> <p>Anyone familiar with environmental groups' views will not be surprised by that appraisal, but the most centrist road and motoring advocates also argue that Kelly and her predecessors have had no time to impose a long-term plan.</p> <p>Edmund King, the president of the AA, says: \"Ruth Kelly had started to address the problems of congestion on our motorways. But we have had 11 transport secretaries in 20 years and now we are waiting for number 12. She has only been transport secretary since June 2007 and the real problem is that it takes someone 12 months to get up to speed with their brief. </p> <p>\"Transport is vital for the country and the economy, yet it seems to be a merry-go-round for ministers to hop on and hop off.\"</p> <p>At a fringe meeting yesterday Kelly was energetic, full of ideas and well in control of her brief. Admittedly, neither she nor her predecessor is likely to bin a third runway at Heathrow, but she at least displayed an enthusiasm and intellectual vigour for the job that some predecessors have lacked. </p> <p>Perhaps she could have overseen the detailed 20-year infrastructure document that Britain needs - why shouldn't airport policy be considered in tandem with road and high-speed rail plans? - but the longevity of the transport post, and of this Labour government, seems to preclude it.</p>",
  "<p>It was another strange day in this ever more strange election campaign, with the focus split between New York and Washington, and the presidential candidates playing a decidedly marginal role. On Capitol Hill, treasury secretary Henry Paulson <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/24/wallstreet.georgebush\">continued to try to sell the Bush administration's bailout plan</a> to an angry Congress, whose members pressured him to toughen it up, while at the United Nations the president <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/24/georgebush.usa\">added lines on the economy to his speech</a>. He didn't get much of a reception: fewer than 10 seconds of polite applause - and a \"thumbs-down\" gesture from Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the president of Iran, whose own speech was a typically anti-Bush and anti-Israel affair. </p> <p>Barack Obama, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/24/uselections2008.barackobama\">engaged in intensive debate preparation in Florida</a>, surfaced to condemn Ahmadinejad's \"outrageous remarks\", and also Bush's \"my-way-or-the-highway intransigence\" on the bailout. John McCain, meanwhile, once again played second fiddle to his running-mate, Sarah Palin, who met the heads of state of Afghanistan and Colombia, and Henry Kissinger, in New York. </p> <p>The McCain/Palin campaign engaged in a brief spat with the written press, which it initially tried to exclude from covering her handshakes with the world leaders, before eventually relenting. But the next round in McCain's war with the media seemed likely to be far more vicious: late last night, the New York Times reported on its website that a firm owned by McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, had <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/us/politics/24davis.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin\">received payments of $15,000 a month until last month</a> from Freddie Mac, one of the mortgage giants implicated in the current economic crisis, in contradiction to the campaign's claims. </p> <h2>What to watch out for</h2> <p>McCain and Palin remain in New York today, while Obama is in Florida, preparing for Friday's debate, which is expected to receive the highest television audience for a political debate in history. Palin will meet Katie Couric, for an interview to be broadcast on tonight's CBS Evening News; despite her friendly exterior, Couric has been known to lob tough questions at her interviewees. </p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Obama remains just ahead in most daily tracking polls: for example, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/110608/Gallup-Daily-Obama-Holds-3Point-Edge.aspx\">Gallup has him at 47% to 44%</a>, down from 48% to 44% yesterday. A <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/23/AR2008092303667.html?hpid=topnews\">Washington Post/ABC poll puts Obama nine points ahead of McCain</a>, attributing his lead to turmoil in the financial industry (just 9% of those polled rate the US economy as good or excellent, the first time this figure has been in single digits since before the 1992 election). A new Pew poll meanwhile gives Obama a huge lead as the candidate voters consider best able to address the financial crisis: 47% to McCain's 35%. But a majority of those questioned backed the US government's bailout plan nonetheless. </p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/24/johnmccain.republicans\">Tomasky Talk: War breaks out between McCain and the media</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/23/uselections2008.useconomy\">Sasha Abramsky: Republican's can't distract attention from the economic crisis</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/24/energy.uselections2008\">Obama declares support for clean coal</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/24/uselections2008.johnmccain\">McCain drives into trouble over fleet of foreign cars</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/sep/23/uselections2008\">Road trip blog: Washington's Orwellian wonderland</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13823.html\">Politico: Palin continues to dodge the media horde</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122221440058969313.html\">Thomas Franks: Judgement day for McCain</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/09/23/1436850.aspx\">MSNBC First Read: Cost of the bailout (in perspective)</a></p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"What is his name?\" </p> <p>\"Mirwais, which means 'The Light of the House'.\" </p> <p>\"Oh nice\" - the only recorded exchange between Sarah Palin and Afghanistan's Hamid Karzai at the UN yesterday.

  "<p>Normal dour service had been resumed by the time Gordon Brown toured the radio and TV studios the morning after the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/sep/24/gordonbrown.labourleadership1\">Big Speech</a>. The prime minister was his old self again. I distinctly heard him warn the financial services industry against piling up risky debts off the balance sheets. Surely that description also fits PFI?</p> <p>But normal service had been resumed by his opponents too in the shape of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/sep/24/ruthkelly.labour\">Ruth Kelly's headline-grabbing resignation</a>, which bumped Downing St down to earth in the wee small hours. Do we detect a plot, not the usual cock-up here? I think we are entitled to ask.</p> <p>It is the timing of the Kelly story which matters more than the event since the Guardian economics writer turned transport secretary has not left much of a mark on government during her mercurial rise from novice backbencher \u2013 novice seems to be the word of the day \u2013 back in 1997 to the cabinet after 2004.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2008/sep/24/labourconference.ruthkelly\">As Toby Helm reports elsewhere</a> Tory HQ was claiming yesterday that Helm had overheard Kelly saying Brown's speech was bad \u2014 not true. Other long-distance rumour-spinning suggests that some dirtier habits from the Republican songbook may be drifting across the Atlantic.</p> <p>The McCain camp is telling some whoppers about Obama, just as Karl Rove told porkies for George Bush. It all goes back to the marketing of Richard Nixon. But credit where credit is due: this sort of stuff has been used by City and Wall St short-selling merchants for decades.</p> <p>So the Tories may \u2013 may \u2013 have had a hand in it. But the old Roman question \"cui bono?\" \u2013 who benefits? \u2013 is always worth asking. In his own blog today, the BBC's Nick Robinson (who has still not shared the inside dope on the BBC's damaging \"Heseltine moment\" scoop) implies that No 10 may have leaked the Kelly-to-quit story to reduce its impact.</p> <p>On the face it's a curiously disingenuous claim, though other level-headed folk share it. \"A controlled explosion\" by No 10, is how one chum describes it: the same technique as the leaking of David Cairns's resignation a few days ago.</p> <p>I have no knowledge of how the story came out. But if you ask the \"cui bono?\" test, it is Brown who is most damaged by it. It bigfoots the aftermath of The Big Speech and it messes up his on/off reshuffle, pencilled in for next weekend. It will have to be on now, but the timing is a mess. He flies to New York today.</p> <p>The first rumours of Kelly's departure apparently surfaced on the BBC's own Newsnight, where reporter David Grossman suggested that she would go. Patrick Wintour was quickly on the case and confirmed it. </p> <p>Grossman also said the chief whip, Geoff Hoon, will go to Brussels next year to replace the UK commissioner, Peter Mandelson, and that Liam Byrne and Jim Murphy will enter cabinet. They're both smart lads. As speculation goes it wasn't daft. It's been said before. But timing is all.</p> <p>Hoon's move makes sense. His deputy, arch-Brownite Nick Brown, was Blair's first chief whip and on some reckonings is already running a parallel operation. Hoon dined with Mandelson last week.</p> <p>The only fly in the ointment is his Ashfield seat: his majority is 10,213 (24%), which makes it almost marginal these days. Old Labour lags still recall with a shudder the night in 1977 when they lost Ashfield's 20,000 majority to the Tories when sitting MP, David Marquand, went off to serve Roy Jenkins in Brussels. Labour under Jim Callaghan was on the slide at the time. Nuff said.</p> <p>Back to Kelly. She insists it's a family thing: her four kids need her. Fair enough. Having four kids since becoming an MP may be her greatest achievement in politics, though she has a supportive husband. I'm happy to accept her explanation (I once caught the cabinet minister in a pre-Christmas toy department on a Friday afternoon); it must be very hard.</p> <p>Yet Kelly confirmed the Newsnight story when she need not have done. Did she fear being culled in a reshuffle? Was she one of the four cabinet ministers alleged to be preparing to resign en masse-ette if Brown refuses to resign? </p> <p>Was she poised to go rather than have to endorse Enlightenment science rather than Papal dogma in voting for the human fertilisation and embryology bill?</p> <p>There have been rumours that she \u2013 fellow Catholics Des Browne and Paul Murphy too \u2013 were grappling with their consciences over the bill. Indeed, Kelly is said to have been annoyed by No 10's rough tactics in leaking her concerns.</p> <p>She refuses to say if she's a member of the conservative Catholic sect Opus Dei (I've asked her myself). </p> <p>Opus Dei's press officer (sic) plays coy footsie about it. Smart Labour Catholics tell me she's almost certainly a supernumerary member \u2013 her brother is. Why not? It's a free country, though partly because Opus Dei has so little influence.</p> <p>Notwithstanding her Opus Dei links (not denied) I don't see Kelly as a hardline pro-Miliband or anti-Brown plotter. That's usually boys' stuff. But it is always possible that her resignation \u2013 apparently agreed with Brown months ago, both sides claim \u2013 might have been used to boost flagging numbers among the \"rebels\".</p> <p>And Brown's speech? I toured the corridors and receptions last night asking delegates and MPs what they thought of it. As with the newspapers today, where Passchendaele columnists (always going over the top) are offset by sour cynics, the reaction is mixed.</p> <p>One MP told me it was \"as good as it could have been. He has listened to us and we are delighted.\" Another said: \"The speech was a string of cliches to please the party and will fall apart in two days. And I'm a loyalist.\" The same MP rates the likelihood of cabinet resignations as zilch.</p> <p>Me, I remain where I was after Brown sat down. Not bad, not bad at all. But voters will want action, not mere talk. They want him to lighten their deepening economic gloom. </p> <p>And that jibe word \"novice\" in Brown's speech. Innocent that I am, I assumed he was talking about David Cameron. But colleagues, Nick Robinson's cameraman to the fore, were quick to shout \"Miliband\".</p> <p>Perhaps he was thinking of Ruth.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's campaign yesterday rushed to proclaim his support for \"clean coal\" technology after remarks by running mate Joe Biden cast doubts on Democratic friendliness to the coal industry.</p> <p>In a videotaped exchange with an environmental campaigner in Ohio, Biden allowed Republicans to change the subject from the financial gloom that has put John McCain on the defensive this week. </p> <p>Asked why he and Obama backed the expensive prospect of capturing and storing carbon dioxide emitted from coal-fired power plants, Biden told the campaigner: \"We're not supporting clean coal \u2026 No coal plants here in America.\"</p> <p>Biden's comments contradict Obama's public promotion of \"clean coal\" as well as a more controversial scheme to turn coal into liquid fuel. </p> <p>Environmentalists have chided Obama for supporting those ideas, but Biden's spontaneous remark could do the Democrats greater damage with voters in coal-producing states such as Ohio and Virginia.</p> <p>\"Senator Obama truly is a friend of the coal industry,\" Rick Boucher, a Democratic congressman from Virginia's coal country, told reporters. \"His record \u2026 and his position in terms of the coal industry's future give us confidence.\"</p> <p>McCain did not challenge Obama's support for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) at power plants, which is years from coming to fruition in the US. </p> <p>But his fellow Republicans unveiled a Coalition to Protect Coal Jobs to accuse Biden of pandering to voters by criticising coal in Ohio while proudly telling Virginians he comes from a line of coal miners.</p> <p>\"[Democrats] are saying one thing in front of a large group, and when they actually are asked their true feelings, that's when we really hear the attacks on coal,\" Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican congresswoman from West Virginia, told reporters.</p> <p>The Obama camp responded by condemning McCain for his resistance to renewable energy tax incentives that are slated for approval in Congress this week. </p> <p>The US solar and wind industries rely on tax credits to continue growing, but those benefits were defeated by one vote last year after McCain withheld his backing.</p> <p>Though the Republican touts his support for solar and wind power on the campaign trail, McCain voted to block the tax credits because they were paid for by the repeal of tax benefits for oil companies. </p> <p>McCain has not spoken about this week's renewable-energy plan \u2013 which includes more than $1.5bn in new tax credits for CCS \u2013 but is considered a likely opponent, given that it also reverses some oil industry incentives.<br> Jeff Bingaman, chairman of the Senate energy committee, said the solar and wind credits likely would pass without McCain's vote but added that his \"voiced opposition to it is obviously a concern\".</p> <p>Of serious concern to some US environmental campaigners is a plank in the clean-energy tax plan that reverses a 30-year-old ban on using government-owned land for private oil shale extraction.</p> <p>Conservatives have long proposed taking oil shale from the ground in western US states to produce more domestic fuel. Like \"clean coal\" and coal-to-liquid fuel production, oil shale is still in its infancy and poses significant environmental threats.</p> <p>\"It requires technology we don't currently have,\" Craig Thompson, a college professor and former president of the Wyoming Wildlife Federation, said. </p> <p>\"It produces a fossil fuel that, at best, may delay by a few years a transition to sustainable energy resources that we're going to have to make anyway in the future.\"</p> <p>Obama is generally supportive of the clean-energy tax credits, which were expected to clear the US Senate late yesterday.</p>",
