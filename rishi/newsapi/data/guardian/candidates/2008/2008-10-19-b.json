  "<p>A year or two ago, if you'd told me that Barack Obama would be leading John McCain by a seemingly comfortable margin with two weeks to go and asked me what, in their desperation, the Republicans would be talking about to try and scare my fellow Americans into voting against him, I'd have said race. After all, Republicans have race-baited in one form or other in most of our presidential contests since Richard Nixon's time, so it would have seemed impossible to me that they'd miss the chance to do so at a time when Democrats had actually gone to the trouble of nominating an African-American candidate.</p> <p>It's true that we're hearing racial-code talk here and there. But the main fear tactic being employed now is something else. It's that Obama and his associates - and for that matter his supporters and even the regions of the country that he's destined to carry - are anti-American.'<br>Last Friday, in North Carolina, Sarah Palin told a rally that she was proud to be \"with all of you hard-working, very patriotic, um, very, um, pro-America areas of this great nation\". She means here of course that there are anti-American areas of America, and they are where the liberals live, and the people there are voting for Mr Anti-America. </p> <p>This was especially interesting coming from a woman whose husband, Todd Palin, was until just six years ago an enrolled member of a rightwing fringe political party that wanted the state of Alaska to secede from the US. But if you understand rightwing logic, then you'd know that Mr Palin had no choice but to join the Alaska Independence party in 1995, because by that time the America he thought he knew and loved had been brought to ruin by the liberals and socialists and America-haters. See?</p> <p>Likewise, earlier this month, Joe McCain, the brother of John, said that Alexandria and Arlington, the two major cities in the northern Virginia suburbs that lie just across the Potomac River from Washington, were \"communist country\" as far as he was concerned. His brother lives in Arlington when in the nation's capital for work, and his brother's campaign is headquartered there as well, but never mind. A McCain spokeswoman offered a wan apology at the time, but lo and behold, just last Saturday a different McCain spokes-woman said on television that while Obama would perform well in northern Virginia, \"the rest of the state - real Virginia if you will - I think will be very responsive to Senator McCain's message\". This did not seem a planned one-liner. The spokeswoman made the fatal error of saying what she actually thinks. Republican Virginia equals real Virginia. Democratic Virginia is alien and impure.</p> <p>Do you folks do this sort of thing in Britain? I know there's something about the chap on the Clapham omnibus who's supposed to represent some kind of middling everyman. And I know you've got your xenophobes just like we do. But trust me. You don't have a right wing that's anything like our right wing.</p> <p>This point was proved most dramatically by a woman named Michele Bachmann, a member of Congress from Minnesota. In an interview last Friday on Hardball, a leading US cable talk show, host Chris Matthews asked Bachmann whether Obama worried her. \"Absolutely. I'm very concerned that he may have anti-American views,\" she said. He asked her what she thought distinguished liberal from hard left from anti-American. If she maintains such distinctions in her mind, she refused to acknowledge them. Then, finally, Matthews - who deftly fed her the rope to hang herself - asked her how many members of the US Congress held, in her view, anti-American views.</p> <p>It's been almost a two-year campaign. There have been moments we've thought of as memorable, only to see the tide of events erase their mark from the sand. Bachmann's answer, however, will live imperishably: \"What I would say - what I would say is that the news media should do a penetrating expos\u00e9 and take a look. I wish they would. I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out, are they pro-America or anti-America? I think people would love to see an expos\u00e9 like that.\"</p> <p>Before we go any further - who is this Bachmann? She's a first-term backbencher from exurban Minneapolis who says the Lord told her to run for Congress. She declared herself \"a fool for Christ\" in 2006 when she announced her candidacy. By all accounts she's down with the whole rightwing Christian package: immigrants bring disease and pestilence, homosexuals want to indoctrinate straight children, and so on. Republican leadership undoubtedly pushed her out on to television because she is, as you Brits say, a looker - at least by the standards of Congress.</p> <p>The call for an investigation into the beliefs of every federal lawmaker, and an expos\u00e9 of those found wanting in their patriotism, certainly takes us into deeply creepy territory. I would not call Bachmann herself a fascist. Odd as it sounds, to do so would be to grant her far too much credit. For one to embrace an -ism, even a repugnant one, one needs to have read a certain amount of history and political philosophy. Bachmann is just an idiot. She wouldn't know Edmund Burke from Billie Burke (she played the good witch in the Wizard of Oz), and she obviously has no idea that, in her rejection of the two bedrock American principles of separation of church and state and freedom of thought, she is the one who is as anti-American as they come.</p> <p>But friends, all is not darkness. Bachmann's appearance caused a national uproar. Colin Powell, in endorsing Obama yesterday, said of Bachmann's comments that \"we have got to stop this kind of nonsense and pull ourselves together\". Her Democratic opponent raised nearly half a million dollars from around the country in just 24 hours, and he now has a chance of beating her.</p> <p>That would be nice. But let's go back to the big contest. With Bachmann, the lid came off the rightwing id. It will happen many more times over these next two weeks. McCain, now openly using the word \"socialist\" to describe Obama's proposals (the week after his friend George W Bush took federal control of nine major banks!), and especially Palin have shown every sign of encouraging it. Their goal is to scare Americans about Obama, but moderate, independent voters might well decide that Obama looks a lot less scary than they do.</p> <p>\u2022Michael Tomasky is editor of Guardian America <br><a href=\"mailto:michael.tomasky@theguardian.com\">michael.tomasky@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>As Barack Obama surges ahead in the polls, the message is clear: America is ready for a black president - as long as he isn't Muslim.</p> <p>There is no doubt that calling someone a Muslim is now considered a slur in American politics. The US media has reported on \"accusations\" that Obama might be a follower of Islam (a claim that 12% of voters believe), as if practising the religion was somehow a crime. The link has been reinforced by the idea that Obama may be hiding his true religion, as some terrified voters have assumed.</p> <p>When a John McCain supporter at a recent rally said she didn't trust Obama because he was an Arab, the senator replied: \"No. He's a decent family man.\"</p> <p>While pundits have expressed anxiety that the white electorate may feign support for Obama while secretly voting for a white candidate, no one is even bothering to pretend they would ever vote for a Muslim. Or even want a Muslim to vote for them.</p> <p>Fatemah Fakhraie, who runs the feminist Muslim website Muslim Media Watch, says: \"I certainly don't think anyone is chasing the Muslim vote. Hearing the word Muslim used as a smear is very damaging. It's damaging to know that people in my country, the country I was born and raised in, don't view me as American. It's alienating for many US Muslims to feel like they don't belong in their own homes.\" </p> <p>Yet Muslims in America are not surprised, according to Sayyeda Mirza-Jafri, a philanthropy consultant from New York, and are not letting it shake their faith in Obama. \"Most people think: let him distance himself from us,\" she says. \"It's not because he's insensitive to the way Muslims feel. It's the way America is. There is just so much Islamophobia. We know he's a moral, good man.\"</p>",
  "<p>Like virtually no one else in the country, I stayed up to watch the final US presidential debate the other night, which started at the user-friendly time of 2am and lasted 350 hours, if you count all the post-match analysis. All the rolling news channels were covering it live, of course, so my choice of network was largely based on aesthetics. Sky News had the colour turned up to cartoon levels, so that was out. The BBC had a more sober palette, and was showing it in widescreen, but there weren't enough distracting tickers and graphics to maintain my attention - I know they're bad, but I just can't help myself - so before long I started channel-surfing. The moment I alighted on CNN, I knew I was going to stay there. Why? Because they had an animated graph.</p> <p>It looked like a heart monitor. For a moment, I thought it was displaying the opponents' pulses. Or maybe it was hooked up to a pad in their seats, and was scrupulously monitoring the amount of arse sweat they'd generate if a tricky question reared its head. But no. Instead it was supposed to be a visual representation of the ever-shifting mind-set of a group of uncommitted Ohio voters.</p> <p>Rather than shoving electrodes into said voters' brains, so they looked like miserable cats in an anti-vivisection poster, CNN had taken the humane route and given them some sort of approval-rating widget. So if you were holding one, and Obama said something you didn't like, you turned the dial down, and if McCain said something you did like, you turned it up. And vice versa. There was one line for women and another for men, so you could see how the different sexes had different reactions. Sadly, that was the full extent of demographic separation. They could've broken it down a little further. It would've been fascinating to see how, say, overweight ginger-haired postmen felt about the possibility of a new free trade agreement with Colombia, but the lazy bastards at CNN couldn't be arsed to tell us.</p> <p>This shocking oversight aside, watching the wobbly line snake up and down as the candidates spoke was mesmerising. So mesmerising you couldn't really hear what they were saying. In fact, it turned the debate into a video game - like SingStar, the PlayStation karaoke thing where you get drunk and try to belt your way through Girls Just Wanna Have Fun without hitting too many bum notes.</p> <p>When the delicate subject of abortion came up, the line became yet more fiddly, and turned into one of those infuriating puzzles where you have to move a metal loop along a twisty-turny electrified wire without touching the sides.</p> <p>Since it's impossible not to root for one candidate or another, this meant that you found yourself egging your favourite on in craven and bizarre ways. \"Shit, the line's dropping - quick, make a rash promise to the American people! Say you'll eliminate taxes! Claim to be Christ! Offer free hand-jobs! Anything!\"</p> <p>At one point I found myself thinking it'd be useful if people had those approval-monitor graphs on their faces in real life, so when you were talking to them at parties you could tell, at a glance, just how interested or bored they were. Then I remembered that's what basic facial expressions are for. Nature always gets there first.</p> <p>Speaking of facial expressions, during the eight or nine nanoseconds I wasn't focused intently on the animated line, the lingering reaction shots provided much entertainment. The screen was split in two so you could see their faces while the other was talking. Obama smiled a lot, so much in fact that he started resembling a reality show contestant watching a compilation of his \"best bits\". McCain's face didn't know quite what to do with itself. It kept trying to look furious. Then you'd see him remember that looking furious doesn't play well, so he'd arrange his face into a tight, eerie grin, while appearing to grow increasingly furious with himself for failing to hide his earlier fury, thereby creating an unfortunate anger-based feedback loop. He should've worn a mask. Is the world ready for a masked president? Hell, yeah. How about one in a Sarah Palin mask? Or Chico Marx? Or Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th? That'd really have thrown Obama off his stride, and given the networks something else to debate ad nauseam, thereby putting McCain back at the top of the news agenda. Is this a new maverick strategy, or a mental breakdown? The pundits would be at it for hours.</p> <p>Despite the visual distractions, a few words and noises did register in my brain. Obama's voice is so soothing, I kept thinking he was about to start advertising coffee. \"I want to say to the American people: this is the finest, mellowest blend your money can buy.\" McCain, meanwhile, was narrating a children's story about Joe the Plumber. Maybe it's a back-up plan: if he doesn't win the presidency, he's going to launch a stop-motion animation series on Nickelodeon. There's probably a warehouse full of Joe the Plumber action figures out there somewhere in the Arizona desert just waiting for the say-so.</p> <p>I kept waiting for Obama to counter McCain's talk of Joe the Plumber by bringing up Boris the Spider or Dennis the Menace or something, but no. He started addressing Joe too. Before long they were both at it, appealing to Joe straight down the lens, which meant I had to keep looking behind me in case he was standing there, fixing a pipe.</p> <p>Then it was over and I went to bed. At least I think I did. Perhaps it was all a dream. Certainly felt that way. An election in Narnia. And they all lived happily ever after. The end. </p> <p>\u2022 This week <strong>Charlie struggled to understand the interface on his new phone</strong>: \"It's like a cross between Windows and a sarcastic cartoon about Windows, with the added disadvantage that you have to try to operate it with your stubby little thumbs.\"</p>",
  "<p>Voters in key swing states from Colorado to Ohio have been targeted with automated phone calls seeking to portray Barack Obama as an extremist who has befriended terrorists and Hollywood celebrities.</p> <p>Opening with the words, \"Hello. I'm calling for John McCain and the RNC [Republican national committee],\" the \"robocalls\" have kicked off a political storm, with Democrats and some Republicans denouncing the McCain campaign for resorting to a tactic the candidate himself has consistently repudiated.</p> <p>Several versions of the calls, addressing topics from abortion to terrorism, were reported by voters in Ohio, Colorado, New Mexico, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Missouri, North Carolina, Florida, Texas, West Virginia, Maine and Georgia.</p> <p>The call focusing on Republican claims that Obama is close to the 1960s radical William Ayers, states: \"You need to know that Barack Obama has worked closely with terrorist Bill Ayers, whose organisation bombed the US Capitol, the Pentagon, a judge's home, and killed Americans. Democrats will enact an extreme leftist agenda if they take control of Washington.\"</p> <p>Another call states: \"Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats got caught putting Hollywood above America. On the very day our elected leaders gathered in Washington to deal with the financial crisis, Barack Obama spent just 20 minutes with economic advisers, but hours at a celebrity Hollywood fundraiser. Where are the Democrats' priorities?\"</p> <p>A third call reprised an attack used in the final presidential debate: \"You need to know that Barack Obama ... opposed a bill requiring doctors to care for babies born alive after surviving attempted abortions ... Barack Obama and his liberal Democrats are too extreme for America ...\"</p> <p>The Senate Democratic majority leader, Harry Reid, expressed surprise at the \"scummy\" tactics. \"[I] can't believe John McCain knows what's going on.\"</p> <p>\"These kind of tactics have no place in Maine politics,\" a spokesman for the Maine Republican senator, Susan Collins, said. Collins is engaged in a tough re-election battle.</p> <p>Critics of the campaign's use of robocalls noted that McCain's professed opposition to the tactic was underpinned by the belief that his downfall in the 2000 Republican presidential primary campaign was due in part to the use of such tactics by his rival, George Bush. With that race tightening, voters in South Carolina received calls asking: \"Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain ... if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child?\"</p> <p>Bush won South Carolina after the allegation, a distortion of the McCains' adoption of a daughter from Bangladesh. That campaign was orchestrated in part by a former South Carolina attorney general, Charlie Condon. Earlier this year, Condon was appointed chairman of the McCain campaign in South Carolina.</p> <p>This week's calls were reportedly the work of a company owned by a Republican consultant named Jeff Larson, as were those made against McCain in 2000. At the time, McCain denounced the practice, saying: \"I promise you I have never, and will never, have anything to do with that kind of political tactic.\"</p> <p>Asked on Sunday if he would stop the calls, McCain said that this time was different. \"These are legitimate and truthful and they are far different than the phone calls that were made about my family ... this is dramatically different and either you ... didn't see those things in 2000 ... or you don't know the difference between that and what is a legitimate issue, and that is Senator Obama being truthful with the American people.\"</p> <p>An Obama campaign spokesman told the New York Times that the use of robocalls reminiscent of the 2000 campaign showed \"just how much McCain has changed since then - adopting not only President Bush's policies but his tactics\".</p> <p>A spokesman for the McCain campaign defended the latest calls, telling the New York Times, \"I would argue that much of these calls are based on hardened facts that American voters should consider.\"</p> <p>During this year's Republican primaries, McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt decried robocalls, saying, \"[It's] a conveyance to introduce new information - and a lot of that information on the phone is slanderous and smearing.\"</p> <p>The robocalls are reported to be part of a $70m get-out-the-vote campaign being waged by the Republican party and the McCain campaign in key battleground states.</p> <p>Although common in the closing stages of a campaign, the calls' effectiveness is open to question, according to Vanderbilt University's John Geer.</p> <p>Robocalls, he told the Washington Post, \"may stimulate turnout, but they would have to be targeted to the right people. It could backfire, and if the attacks get in the mainstream media, the push back, too, could be substantial.\"</p> <p>The Guardian's coast-to-coast team attend a get-out-the-vote rally in Sante Fe and talk to some of the hundreds of Obama supporters lining up to cast their vote ahead of polling day on November 4.

  "<p>Israeli leaders are considering reviving a 2002 peace plan that offered the Jewish nation a comprehensive end to its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/israelandthepalestinians\">conflict with the Arab world</a>, Israel's defence minister, Ehud Barak, said yesterday.</p> <p>Talks with the Palestinians and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\">Syrians</a> have yielded little in almost a year so it may be time to consider the Saudi plan which offers Israel normal relations with all 22 Arab countries in exchange for a Palestinian state, Barak said. \"We have a mutual interest with moderate Arab elements on the issues of Iran, Hizbullah and Hamas,\" Barak told Israeli radio.</p> <p>He added that he had discussed the plan with Israel's prime minister elect, Tzipi Livni, who has also indicated a willingness to resuscitate the plan. </p> <p>But Livni has struggled to form a new coalition government to replace Ehud Olmert, who resigned his leadership this year amid a fraud investigation. </p> <p>For the past month she has been talking to opposition parties and yesterday she asked the president, Shimon Peres, for extra time. </p> <p>Livni has secured the support of Barak's Labour party, but now she is seeking the support of Shas, a religious party, that is holding out for bigger family support payments.</p> <p>Barak is the third Israeli leader over the past month that has publicly touted a peace deal akin to the Saudi plan which would require Israel to withdraw from land it captured in 1967 and has occupied ever since including east Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights.</p> <p>Shas insists that Israel must not surrender east Jerusalem but still Barak said \"there is room in the Israeli coalition for the Saudi initiative\". </p> <p>Barak said he fully supported Peres, who last month proposed combining Israel's various peace talks to produce a regional agreement and urged the Saudis to press on with their plan. Barak added that Livni agreed with revisiting the Saudi proposal.</p>",

The other was the news that his campaign had raised a record $150m (\u00a386m) in September, dwarfing his previous monthly high of $65m in August, and bringing the total raised to $605m.</p> <p>At the weekend, Obama also attracted his biggest US audience of the campaign, when 100,000 people attended a rally in St Louis, Missouri. On Saturday evening, 75,000 people attended an Obama rally in Kansas City. The huge turnouts came as the latest national polls showed the presidential race essentially static, with Obama maintaining a lead of 4%-7%.</p> <p>Speaking on the TV programme Meet the Press, Powell, 71, offered an impassioned endorsement of Obama, and a harsh repudiation of the McCain campaign.</p> <p>\"It was not easy for me to disappoint Senator McCain in the way that I have done this morning,\" Powell said. \"We need a transformational figure, a president who is a generational change, That is why I'm supporting Barack Obama.</p> <p>\"Because of his ability to inspire, because of the inclusive nature of his campaign, because he is reaching out all across America, because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities - and you have to take that into account - he has both style and substance, he has met the standard of being a successful president, being an exceptional president.\"</p> <p>He said race was not a factor in his decision, but added: \"It will be an historic event for an African-American to become president, and, if that happens, all Americans should be proud.\"</p> <p>Powell, who said he had made up his mind over the last two months, was damning about McCain's response to the economic crisis, about what he described as the Republican party's drift further to the right during the campaign, and the attack politics of recent weeks.</p> <p>He also had harsh words for McCain's selection of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as running mate. \"He [McCain] was a little unsure about how to deal with the economic problems,\" Powell said. \"That concerned me. I was also concerned at the selection of Governor Palin ... I don't believe she's ready to be vice-president of the United States. That raises some questions ... about the judgment Senator McCain made.\"</p> <p>He also criticised the McCain campaign for focusing on Obama's alleged ties to the 1960s radical William Ayers. \"Why do we keep talking about him and why do we have these robocalls going on?\" he asked. \"This goes too far ... it's not what the American people are looking for. The party has moved even further to the right ... The approach of the Republican party and Mr McCain has become narrower and narrower. Obama has been more inclusive,\" Powell said.</p> <p>Obama said he was \"beyond honoured and deeply humbled\" by Powell's support. At a rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, he said: \"[Powell] knows, as we do, that this is a moment where we need to come together as one nation - young and old, rich and poor, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, Republican and Democrat.\" Addressing a crowd of 10,000, Obama added: \"He reminded us that at this defining moment we don't have the luxury of relying on the same political games, the same political tactics that have been used in so many elections to divide us from one another and make us afraid of one another.\"</p> <p>McCain said he was not surprised by the endorsement. He was pleased he had the backing of four other former secretaries of state and many military leaders. Speaking on Fox television, he said: \"We're very happy with the way the campaign is going. I've been on enough campaigns, my friend, to sense enthusiasm and momentum, and we've got it.\"</p> <p>Despite Obama's lead in both poll ratings and fundraising, McCain said he could sense \"things are heading our way.\"</p> <p>\"I love being the underdog. You know every time that I've gotten ahead, somehow I've messed it up,\" McCain said.</p> <p>Powell's endorsement should aid Obama in foreign policy and national security, areas in which he is thought to be weaker. Powell served as national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan, was appointed chairman of the joint chiefs of staff by the first President George Bush, and was secretary of state during the current president's first term.</p> <p>While his endorsement carries great weight with Republicans, his standing among liberals was knocked following his speech to the UN before the invasion of Iraq. His enthusiastic support for Obama's \"steadiness\" and \"intellectual vigour\", however, will reassure many Democrats.</p> <p>The money raised in September enables Obama to push his campaign into Republican areas, forcing the McCain campaign to spend money to shore up support in what should be safe states. The Obama campaign said the average donation was less than $100. September brought 632,000 new donors, bringing the total number during the campaign to 3.1 million.</p> <p>The Democratic national committee also raised $49.9m in September.</p> <p>McCain chose to accept public funding of his campaign, which limits the amount he can spend in September and October to $84m. The Republican National Committee raised $66m in September.</p> <p>Much of Obama's financial advantage can be seen on the country's TV screens, where Democrat campaign commercials outplay McCain by three or four to one. The Obama campaign has even purchased a half hour prime-time slot on the major networks a week before the election day.</p> <h2>Endorsements</h2> <p><strong>Obama</strong></p> <p>Oprah Winfrey</p> <p>Bruce Springsteen</p> <p>JK Rowling</p> <p>Christopher Buckley</p> <p>George Clooney</p> <p>Caroline Kennedy (daughter of JFK)</p> <p>Susan Eisenhower (granddaughter of Republican president Eisenhower)</p> <p><strong>McCain</strong></p> <p>Sylvester Stallone</p> <p>Clint Eastwood</p> <p>Robert Duvall</p> <p>Jon Voight</p> <p>Curt Schilling (star pitcher for Boston Red Sox baseball team)</p> <p>John Elway (former star quarterback for Denver Broncos football team)</p> <p>Richard Petty (Nascar car-racing veteran)</p>",
  "<p>With a timing so potent that it cannot be accidental, the man who might have been the US's first African-American president yesterday endorsed the man who now looks increasingly likely to have that accolade in a little over two weeks' time. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/colin-powell\">Colin Powell's</a> reputation remains inevitably clouded by his role in the Iraq war, but he still retains much of his eminent status as one of the iconic American public figures of modern times. His endorsement of Barack Obama yesterday was telling both in itself and for the reasons that the Republican ex-general chose. John McCain, said Mr Powell, had struck an uncertain and contradictory note in addressing the US's economic problems, while his choice of the inadequate Sarah Palin as his running mate raised questions about the Republican nominee's judgment. In giving those clear verdicts on the two key issues of this phase of the campaign, expressed with all his enduring moral authority, Mr Powell is manifestly speaking for many other Americans. Most Democrats were always going to vote for Mr Obama, while most Republicans were always likely to vote for Mr McCain. The votes of independents and liberal Republicans were always the key, and Mr McCain's errors have increasingly driven them into the arms of Mr Obama. Mr Powell points the way for such voters on November 4. But he also signals the kind of soul-searching that Republicans must undertake if Mr McCain loses. It is good to see that Mr Powell has got his judgment and his boldness back.</p>",
  "<p>I spent a fair amount of time thinking and talking to people about Obama's fund-raising. I know that it's around the 20th of every month that the totals come out. So for the past week, I've been thinking a lot about what his September number would be.</p> <p>August was $67 million. I was guessing that September would be $75 million and that for October, for the final push, he'd top $100 million. </p> <p>And now, gadzooks, <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/2008/10/19/obama-pulls-in-150-million/\">the September number is $150 million</a>. It's really staggering. Most money that campaigns raise is spent on television ads. But remember that the Obama campaign is also banking on an unprecedented get-out-the-vote operation. That is expensive. Done right, it requires tons of field offices, tons of paid outreach workers (as opposed to volunteers) and massive amounts of money spent on phone banks and literature and so on. This number makes it pretty clear that Obama is going to be able to fund this massive operation to whatever extent he sees fit.</p> <p>It's worth remembering here that September, at least the first half of it, was a comparatively <em>bad </em>time for Obama. He was behind for the first half of the month. McCain-Palin had the momentum. Democrats and liberals were tearing their hair out (do you say hairs? We have serious disagreements about these plural/singular constructions, like math and maths and sport and sports, and there is no discernible pattern). Obama wasn't doing this, wasn't doing that. His partisans were dispirited for half the month of September, and still, $150 million.</p> <p>Makes you wonder what the October numbers will be.<br></p>",

The huge turnouts came as the latest national polls showed the race essentially static, with Obama maintaining a lead of 4-7%.</p> <p>Speaking on the television programme Meet the Press, Powell, 71, offered an impassioned endorsement of Obama, and a harsh repudiation of the McCain campaign.</p> <p>\"It was not easy for me to disappoint Senator McCain in the way that I have done this morning,\" Powell said. \"We need a transformational figure, a president who is a generational change, That is why I'm supporting Barack Obama. \"Because of his ability to inspire,\" Powell said, \"because of the inclusive nature of his campaign, because he is reaching out all across America, because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities - and you have to take that into account - as well as his substance, he has both style and substance, he has met the standard of being a successful president, being an exceptional president.\"</p> <p>Although he said race was not a factor in his decision, he added: \"It will be an historic event for an African-American to become president, and, if that happens, all Americans should be proud.\"</p> <p>Powell, who said that he had made up his mind over the last two months, was damning of McCain's response to the economic crisis, of what he described as the Republican party's drift further to the right during the campaign, and of the attack politics that have played out in recent weeks. He also had harsh words for McCain's selection of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate.</p> <p>\"He [McCain] was a little unsure about how to deal with the economic problems,\" Powell said. \"That concerned me. I was also concerned at the selection of Governor Palin ... I don't believe she's ready to be vice-president of the United States. That raises some questions ... about the judgment Senator McCain made.\"</p> <p>He criticised the McCain campaign for focusing on Obama's alleged ties to the 1960s radical William Ayers. \"Why do we keep talking about him and why do we have these robocalls going on?\" he asked. \"This goes too far ... it's not what the American people are looking for. The party has moved even further to the right.\"</p> <p>In striking terms, he contrasted the evolution with the approach of the Democratic candidate. \"The approach of the Republican party and Mr McCain has become narrower and narrower. Obama has been more inclusive,\" Powell said.</p> <p>McCain said he was not surprised by the endorsement, but he was pleased he had the backing of four other former secretaries of state and scores of past and present military leaders.</p> <p>Powell's endorsement should aid Obama in one area in which he is thought to be weaker than his opponent, foreign policy and national security. The retired four-star general served as national security adviser to President Reagan, was appointed chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff by the first President Bush, and was secretary of state during the current president's first term.</p> <p>While his endorsement carries great weight with many Republicans, his standing among liberals was knocked following his speech before the UN in February 203 in the run up to the invasion of Iraq. His enthusiastic support for Obama's \"steadiness\" and \"intellectual vigour\", however, will undoubtedly help to reassure many Democrats.</p> <p>Even without the Powell endorsement, Democrats will be feeling less anxious about the final days of the campaign. The money raised by their candidate in September enables Obama to push his campaign into Republican areas, forcing the McCain campaign to spend money to shore up his support in what should be safe states.</p> <p>The campaign said that the money came in an average donation of less than $100. It attracted 632,000 new donors in September, bringing the total number of donors during the campaign to 3.1m. <br>Its previous record amount was the $65m raised in August. The Obama campaign's fund-raising was joined by $49.9m raised by the Democratic National Committee in September.</p> <p>McCain chose to accept public funding of his campaign, which limits the amount he can spend in September and October to $84m. The Republican National Committee raised $66m in September for the McCain campaign. Much of the financial advantage held by the Democrat can be seen on the nation's TV screens, where Obama campaign commercials outplay McCain by ratios of three or four to one. The Obama campaign has even purchased a half-hour prime-time slot on the major networks to run an infomercial a week before election day.</p>",
  "<p>Pssst. The truth is, among people who are most likely to be ardent supporters of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/colin-powell\">Colin Powell</a> would not win any popularity polls.</p> <p>Even factoring in today's endorsement of Obama, he will long be best-remembered by American liberals for his now-infamous presentation to the UN on Saddam Hussein's phantom weapons of mass destruction and for not going public with what everyone assumes were his serious reservations about the war in Iraq to begin with.</p> <p>But he did manage to make up for some of it today. Powell's announcement on Meet the Press was thoughtful and deliberate, and while there will surely be a segment of the US population who will dismiss Powell's move as an act of racial solidarity, I felt he managed to make a broader case that most fair-minded people will find convincing.</p> <p>Powell - who affirmed, for what it's worth, that he is indeed still a<br>member of the Republican party - said he liked <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> tremendously. But he doesn't like his choice of running mate, he thinks his party has moved too far to the right and declared himself \"disappointed by some of the approaches\" the McCain campaign had taken against Obama.</p> <p>He cited Obama's \"steadiness\" and \"intellectual curiosity\". When asked about the race issue, he said: \"If I had only had that in mind, I could have done this six or eight or 10 months ago,\" instead of taking the time to watch the two contenders on the trail and judge their performance under pressure.</p> <p>But he really shone when discussing some of the smear tactics being used against Obama. No, the correct answer is that Obama is not a Muslim, Powell said. \"But the really right answer,\" he continued, \"is, what if he is? Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer's no, that's not America. Is there something wrong with some seven-year-old Muslim-American kid believing that he or she could be president?\"</p> <p>He then described a picture he'd seen in a magazine of a grieving mother at the tombstone of her son, a soldier who had died in Iraq. The tombstone listed his age and awards, Powell said, but across the top \"it didn't have a Christian cross. It didn't have a Star of David. It had a crescent and a star of the Islamic faith.\"</p> <p>It was incredibly moving - the words and the anecdote were extremely well chosen, and they're worth dwelling on for two reasons. First, it's needed saying for months now that there's nothing wrong with being a Muslim in this country. And second, it's not too much to say that, of all the political leaders in America, only Colin Powell could have said these things and made them stick. A Democrat making that case would be seen as just another politically correct harpy. It's pretty different coming from a Republican and a soldier.</p> <p>How much impact will Powell's endorsement have? It will be considerable in Washington, where the general's standing among political professionals and the high priests of the punditry is lofty. For two days - and every day is crucial when there are only 15 left - McCain's minions will have to answer questions on television about how big a blow this is to their man's chances.</p> <p>Around the country, I'm not sure. Still-undecided voters in swing states are probably inclined toward a generally positive view of Powell, so his imprimatur will be one more sign that it's alright to vote Obama. And if they're still trying to get comfortable with Obama at this late date, a friendly nod from a familiar face probably will factor into their deliberations when they close the curtain and vote.</p>",
  "<p>Voters in key swing states from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/colorado\">Colorado</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ohio\">Ohio</a> have been targeted with automated phone calls seeking to portray Barack Obama as an extremist who has befriended terrorists and Hollywood celebrities.</p> <p>Opening with the words, \"Hello. I'm calling for<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\"> John McCain</a> and the RNC,\" the robocalls have sparked a political storm, with Democrats and some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/republicans\">Republicans</a> denouncing the McCain campaign for resorting to a tactic the candidate himself has consistently repudiated.</p> <p>Several versions of the calls, addressing topics from abortion to terrorism, were reported by voters in Ohio, Colorado, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/newmexico\">New Mexico</a>, Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/virginia\">Virginia</a>, Missouri, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/northcarolina\">North Carolina</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/florida\">Florida</a>, Texas, West Virginia, Maine and Georgia.</p> <p>One robocall, focusing on Republican allegations that Obama is close to the 1960s radical William Ayers, states: \"You need to know that Barack Obama has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, whose organization bombed the US Capitol, the Pentagon, a judge's home, and killed Americans. And Democrats will enact an extreme leftist agenda if they take control of Washington.\"</p> <p>Ayers, who served on the board of a nonprofit organisation in Chicago with Obama, co-founded the radical leftwing organisation Weather Underground, which was behind a bombing campaign in the late 1960s and 1970s. The only people who were killed in the campaign were three members of the group, who died in a bomb-making accident. Obama has criticised the \"despicable acts\" of the group.</p> <p>Another of the automated Republican calls states: \"Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats got caught putting Hollywood above America. On the very day our elected leaders gathered in Washington to deal with the financial crisis, Barack Obama spent just 20 minutes with economic advisers, but hours at a celebrity Hollywood fundraiser. Where are the Democrats' priorities?\"</p> <p>A third call reprised an attack delivered the day before, in the final presidential debate: \"You need to know that Barack Obama ... opposed a bill requiring doctors to care for babies born alive after surviving attempted abortions ... Barack Obama and his liberal Democrats are too extreme for America.\"</p> <p>The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, expressed his surprise at the \"scummy\" tactics being used by the McCain campaign, saying: \"[I] can't believe John McCain knows what's going on.\"</p> <p>\"These kind of tactics have no place in Maine politics,\" said a spokesman for the Maine Republican senator Susan Collins. \"Senator Collins urges the McCain campaign to stop these calls immediately.\" Collins is engaged in a tough re-election battle in the state.</p> <p>Critics of the McCain campaign's use of robocalls noted McCain's professed opposition to the tactic was underpinned by the belief his defeat in the 2000 Republican presidential primary campaign was due in part to the use of such tactics by his rival, George Bush.</p> <p>While that election was tightening, voters in South Carolina received robocalls asking: \"Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain ... if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child?\"</p> <p>The allegation, rooted in McCain's adoption of a girl from Bangladesh, paid off and Bush took South Carolina. Bush's campaign was orchestrated in part by the former South Carolina attorney general Charlie Condon. Earlier this year, Condon was appointed chair of McCain's South Carolina campaign.</p> <p>This week's calls, as with those made for the Bush campaign in 2000, were reportedly the work of a company owned by a Republican consultant named Jeff Larson.</p> <p>An Obama campaign spokesman told the New York Times the use of robocalls reminiscent of the 2000 campaign showed, \"just how much Senator McCain has changed since then - adopting not only President Bush's policies but his tactics.\"</p> <p>But a spokesman for the McCain campaign defended the calls, telling the paper, \"I would argue that much of these calls are based on hardened facts that American voters should consider.\"</p> <p>During this year's Republican primary, McCain's campaign manager, Steve Schmidt, decried robocalls. \"So it's a conveyance to introduce new information - and a lot of that information on the phone is slanderous and smearing,\" he said. \"But if not enough about who the person is, or what they're about, is known, is the criteria for it working. When you're a defined entity like [McCain] is now, they have a very minimal effect.\"</p>",

  "<p>After serving three Republican presidents, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/colin-powell\">Colin Powell</a> has given the 2008 Democratic presidential candidate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>, one of his biggest endorsements. Powell's popularity both at home and abroad means this is a huge blow for Obama's Republican rival, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>.</p> <p>The 71-year-old served as Ronald Regan's national security adviser between 1987 and 1989, supporting the \"Star Wars\" missile programme, and has long been one of the most respected African-Americans in US public life.</p> <p>Under the tenure of George HW Bush he was promoted to four-star general and became chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, America's highest military job. He was the first African-American to hold the post. Along with General Norman Schwarzkopf, he led the coalition to victory in the first Gulf war against Iraq in 1991, becoming a national hero, and was urged by some to stand for president in the late 1990s.</p> <p>Born in Harlem and raised in the South Bronx of New York to Jamaican immigrant parents, he joined the army after graduating from college and had a 35-year career as a soldier, including tours of duty in Vietnam. He has said he is still haunted by the nightmare of Vietnam and believes the war was characterised by poor leadership.</p> <p>In 2001 he became the highest-ranking African-American in any US administration when George W Bush appointed him as his secretary of state. Powell was seen as a moderate voice in the Bush cabinet, particularly on Iraq, and gradually became more critical of the administration after being replaced by Condoleezza Rice following Bush's 2004 re-election. According to the Washington Post, he had been asked to resign by the president's chief of staff, Andrew Card.</p> <p>After the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/flash/0,,423247,00.html\">1991 Gulf war</a>, Powell's approach to intervention - described as his \"doctrine\" by the media - was characterised as exercising caution when sending US troops to fight abroad and ensuring there was a clear national interest and exit strategy.</p> <p>However, he was criticised in some quarters for his support for the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and his support for now-derided intelligence on Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. In the run-up to the conflict, Powell told the UN military action was needed against Iraq because \"there can be no doubt that Saddam Hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more\". He also praised the UK's notorious <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/04/iraq.iraq\">\"dodgy dossier\"</a> as a \"fine paper\".</p> <p>In spite of his protestations that reports of a cabinet split over Iraq had been exaggerated, Powell's relationship with Bush deteriorated after he was forced to justify the invasion. Powell is said to have doubted the accuracy of some of the \"evidence\" against Saddam and last year himself revealed that he once spent two and a half hours trying to persuade Bush not to invade Iraq.</p> <p>Since leaving office, Powell has campaigned against the appointment of the former Pentagon official John Bolton as the US ambassador to the UN, criticised the Bush administration's response to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hurricanekatrina\">hurricane Katrina</a> and there has been growing anticipation he would back Obama.</p>",
  "<p>Now that I've recovered from an evil virus that prevented my posting for a few days (I'm talking about my own health rather than that of my computer), I can finally get round to linking to CultureGrrl's <a href=\"http://www.artsjournal.com/culturegrrl/2008/10/finally_finding_john_mccains_a.html\">piece</a> on the cultural policy of the presidential candidates in the US. Well, such matters are, frankly, so low on the list of current priorities as to barely register, but it's of some interest to note that McCain makes Jeremy Hunt and Ed Vaizey, the Conservative shadow culture people, look like paragons of artistic sensitivity and supportiveness.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.earbox.com/\">John Adams</a>, the composer of sometime controversial works such as The Death of Klinghoffer (performances of which were cancelled in the wake of 9/11 because some asserted that the opera, about the hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship, romanticised and validated its Palestinian terrorist characters), believes that he is now \"blacklisted\" in the US. He receives unpleasant grillings at airports and believes he may be being followed by the security services. He talked about this on BBC Radio 3's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00f0bhs\">Music Matters</a> yesterday and Vanessa Thorpe <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/19/classicalmusicandopera-usnationalsecurity\">reported the story</a> in this morning's Observer.

  "<p>The states of Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico are key to what has been called Barack Obama's Western strategy. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._presidential_election,_2004\">All three states helped send George W Bush</a> to a second term, but they are all leaning, even if slightly, to Obama. New Mexico shows why these states have been challenging for Democrats and also why Barack Obama might win here.</p> <p>We're now in Colorado. We've been to Nevada and New Mexico, and here is The Nation's Ari Melber talking about Obama's western strategy:</p> <p><strong>Western Democrats, a different breed</strong></p> <p>Politics in these western states is very different than on the coasts. Take Democratic Bill Richardson for example. He touts his support for <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Bill_Richardson_Gun_Control.htm\">gun rights and won the endorsement of the National Rifle Association</a>. He has a permit to carry a concealed weapon, said Heath Haussamen who covers politics for the New Mexico Independent.</p> <p>John McCain's message of \"drill, baby, drill\" also plays well in this oil and natural gas producing state, Heath said. The <a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/oil_and_gas/leaseholder.php?cust_id=-199080\">Yates Petroleum Company headquartered here is the largest holder</a> of oil and gas drilling leases on federal land in the West, and it's been an important industry for the state.</p> <p>This is a traditionally Democatic state, but the majority of Democrats are conservative Hispanic Democrats, Heath said, and they supported President Bush on the war longer than many other groups.</p> <p>\"They are pro-drilling, pro-life, big 2nd amendment supporters, but they also believe in welfare and unions. New Mexico voters have tended to send moderate Republicans to Washington, but the state has been trending leftward,\" Heath said.</p> <p><strong>Economic concerns</strong></p> <p>The state is one of the least affected by the housing crisis, and 25% of jobs in the state are for either the state or federal government, said <a href=\"http://joemonahansnewmexico.blogspot.com/\">New Mexico political blogger Joe Monahan</a>. Despite that, as with the rest of the country, the economy is the biggest issue.</p> <p>When I interviewed Joe, he was working on a story about <a href=\"http://joemonahansnewmexico.blogspot.com/2008_10_01_joemonahansnewmexico_archive.html#3508873368368298623#3508873368368298623\">a possible budget crunch in the state</a>, and the state's most populous <a href=\"http://kob.com/article/stories/S623232.shtml?cat=519\">county had just announced a $10m budget shortfall</a>.</p> <p>Heath lives in Las Cruces in the south of the state, and there are $200m in state or federal construction projects in the city alone. \"People are concerned that the government will have to cut back on spending to pay for financial bailout.\"</p> <p>A month ago, New Mexico was a toss-up state, but now, \"the consensus is that Obama has the edge,\" Heath said. RealClearPolitics shows <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/nm/new_mexico_mccain_vs_obama-448.html\">Obama with an average 8.4% lead</a> based on polls in the state.</p> <p>Two things in the last four years that have changed to help Barack Obama, Joe said. \"National security issue is not quite as dominant as an issue, and economic security is.\"</p> <p><strong>Obama's organisation</strong></p> <p>One thing that we're seeing in the states we're driving through is the presence of the Obama campaign and the enthusiasm of his supporters. In New Mexico, Obama has 40 field offices to McCain's 10. That number of field offices is unheard of, Heath said.</p> <p>Barack Obama has also been reaching out to Native American voters, which make up 10% of the state. They have volunteers and paid staff focused on getting out the vote in the native nations. They have held rallies focused on Native voters. \"The Obama campaign isn't taking anything for granted,\" said Trip Jennings, the news editor for the New Mexico Independent.</p> <p>Joe says that it's important not to over-emphasise the advantage in field offices and ground organisation by Democrats because theri voters tend to be less reliable. They have to work harder to get them to the polls. John McCain has run a more traditional campaign relying on phone banks and direct mail. Republicans appeal to a \"more likely voter\" so don't have to put as much effort to get voters out, he said.</p> <p>Also in Obama's favour is that Governor Bill Richardson has also been a strong ally since he decided to endorse him over Hillary Clinton, even though he had served <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Richardson#U.S._Ambassador_to_the_United_Nations\">in Bill Clinton's administration</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/04/02/BAVNVU2PJ.DTL\">setting off the former president's famous anger</a>.</p> <p>Governor Richardson has been a major fundraiser for Obama, bringing in $2m for the presidential campaign at a recent event, and he's helped Obama navigate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/18/uselections2008-race-newmexico\">the unique politics of the state</a>.</p> <p><strong>The final stretch</strong></p> <p>Two weeks before the election, Joe says that Obama doesn't have the kind of lead that assures victory. \"There are a lot of voters who can be influenced by whatever is the last thing they see. While this election looks likes its trending Democrat and Obama, I don't think the margin is enough to rule out some kind of major development that could lead to an upset.\"</p> <p>The campaigns are fighting hard for the state's votes. <a href=\"http://newmexicoindependent.com/5649/biden-rallies-southern-nm-voters-for-obama\">Joe Biden campaigned in southern New Mexico</a> this week, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/18/uselections2008-newmexico\">Sarah Palin is coming to Roswell</a>.</p> <p>A number of people I've spoke to along the way have said that whoever wins the presidential election will actually lose because the problems facing the country are so great, but Joe disagrees.</p> <p>He said: \"The next president is going to have a terrible job, but out of a terrible situation can come often come greatness. You would not have had an FDR without the Depresion. You would not have had a Lincoln with the Civil War. This is really going to test whoever wins the White House.\"</p>",
  "<p>Road Trip, Day 7. This morning we set off early for a long drive north from Albuquerque to Colorado Springs, where we hope to get a whiff of the famed evangelical Christian fervor the city is famous for, and see Sarah Palin in person at a rally on Monday morning. </p> <p>One hour out, we decided to stop off at a political rally in Santa Fe, where state politicians were supposed to lead locals in an early voting drive to the polls. When we got there the place looked dead, and we decided it was a bust. But one of the team had to find a toilet, and disappeared for the longest time into a building. Finally reappearing, he motioned to us to follow him around the corner. And there were the voters: not 10 or 20, but a good 75, waiting in the sun for as long as 2 hours, with more people joining the line all the time. </p> <p>So here in Santa Fe was first proof of what both Republicans and Democrats fear, though for entirely different reasons: a huge turnout that is certain to favor Obama, but would also swamp the polls and overtax the state's voting system. Brian Egolf, who is running for state representative from Santa Fe, told me he believed the turnout would be an unheard of 85 percent. </p> <p>Emerging from the voting booth in his wheelchair, Joe Parker, a state employee, told me that he had been turned away from voting at the primary and wasn't going to have that happen again. \"I want to be sure there are no problems,\" he said with a tight smile, explaining that ballots in New Mexico had a way of getting \"lost.\" By voting early with a paper ballot, he hoped to ensure that his vote would be actually be counted. Others expressed the same sentiments, fearing for the worst in a state with a wretched recent record of failure at the ballot box.</p> <p>Our researcher Jean Casella, who is tracking voter suppression from state to state as we cross the country, sent me the following rundown of the massive problems that plagued the 2004 election here in New Mexico: </p> <p>The results showed a sky-high rate of \"undervotes\"\u2014ballots that have been cast but do not include a vote in a particular contest. According to the group <a href=\"http://votetrustusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=208&amp;Itemid=113\">VoteTrustUSA</a>,<br>New Mexico led the nation in the undervotes with an astonishing one out of every 36 ballots missing a vote for president. The total undervotes came to over 21,000\u2014more than five times the margin of victory in that election, which George W. Bush won by fewer than 4,000 votes. </p> <p>Because New Mexico's five electoral votes would not have changed the outcome of the 2004 race, this massive loss of votes received relatively little attention. But it drove home the risks of electronic voting. An analysis by VotersUnite.org revealed that \"more than 80% of New Mexico's undervotes were recorded (or, more accurately, not recorded)\" on Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) voting machines,\" with no verifiable paper trails. </p> <p>Amid protests and lawsuits, Governor Bill Richardson in 2006 signed a state law banning the machines and requiring paper ballots. He warned other states against the technology, saying, \"One person, one vote is in jeopardy.\" That year's election saw a <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=4193\">huge drop </a>in the undervote rate. </p> <p>With mandated paper ballots, New Mexico is not likely to relive the travesty of 2004. But now there are worries about the <a href=\"http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2007/dec/19/new-mexico-has-no-plans-toss-voting-machines/\">machines that count the paper ballots</a>, as well as about shortages of ballots and of polling places. Once burned, New Mexicans have good reason to be worried about their votes being counted.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Monday October 20 2008. Above we said that New Mexico has four electoral votes, it has five. This has been changed.</p>"
