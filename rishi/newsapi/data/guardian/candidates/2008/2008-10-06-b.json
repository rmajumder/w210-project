  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338345947\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1840866694_gdn-int-081007-cb-US-Elections-Adverts-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>The US presidential debate slipped deeper into the mud yesterday as the Democrats joined the Republicans in dredging up damaging events from each candidate's past ahead of tonight's prime-time television debate between Barack Obama and John McCain. </p> <p>Obama's campaign team, intent on demonstrating it is not going to be a soft touch, resurrected a 1989 financial scandal involving McCain. In a concerted advertising and internet blitz, Obama used the scandal in which McCain was reprimanded to link the Republican candidate for the White House to lobbyists and big business.</p> <p>The blitz was in retaliation for McCain linking the Democrat nominee at the weekend with Bill Ayers, a former member of a US urban guerrilla group.</p> <p>McCain's vice-presidential running-mate Sarah Palin, at a rally in Florida yesterday, again brought up the link between Obama and Ayers, and forecast that the campaign between now and election day was \"gonna get kind of rough\". </p> <p>The exchanges have created a poisonous atmosphere ahead of the debate in Nashville, Tennessee, one of the last chances for the Republicans to turn around a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/uselections2008\">White House election</a> that appears to be slipping away from them.</p> <p>The town-hall style debate is more important for McCain than Obama. A draw would be good enough for the Democratic candidate, but McCain needs to secure a clear-cut victory that might reverse the huge opinion poll losses of the past fortnight. If Obama maintains the poll lead through to the election on November 4, the Democrats would enjoy one of their biggest landslides in history.</p> <p>Tad Devine, the Democratic strategist who was a key adviser to both <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/algore\">Al Gore</a> in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004, said: \"He is going to have to go after Obama. If he doesn't go after Obama in the town hall meeting, his election is over. It's like sands through the hour glass.\" </p> <p>Although McCain apparently told his campaign team that Obama's ties with his former pastor, the controversial Jeremiah Wright, were off-limits, the conservative columnist William Kristol wrote in the New York Times yesterday that Palin said: \"I don't know why that association isn't discussed more, because those were appalling things that that pastor had said about our great country.\" </p> <p>Howard Wolfson, Hillary Clinton's former communications manager, wrote in a blog for New Republic that McCain's negative campaign would not save the Republican candidate. \"John McCain's candidacy is as much a casualty of Wall Street as Lehman or Merrill,\" he said.</p> <p>Although there is a sense of despondency in the McCain camp, they are clinging to the fact that Obama's lead in the opinion polls is not, given the economic background, double the 7% lead that Gallup recorded yesterday. The poll put Obama on 50% to McCain's 43%.</p> <p>McCain, who was relatively passive in the first televised debate with Obama, spent the weekend at his home in Sedona, Arizona, practising for tonight's event which will be in his preferred format, with questions coming from the audience. Obama spent yesterday holed up in Asheville, North Carolina, rehearsing his lines, with a Washington lawyer, Greg Craig, playing the part of McCain.</p> <p>Obama broke off preparations yesterday for a television interview in which he spoke about his new ad describing McCain as one of the senators who lobbied in 1989 on behalf of Charles Keating, whose savings and loans institution collapsed. </p> <p>Obama claimed this showed McCain relied on lobbyists from the big oil companies and other corporations. \"I think it's going to be a lot more relevant to the American people than somebody who is tangentially related to me,\" Obama said, referring to Ayers. </p> <p>McCain's team said yesterday he would seek to raise concerns about the impact on voters of Obama's tax increases, and also Obama's criticism of US air raids on Afghan civilians.</p> <p>The McCain team faces potentially bad publicity after seven Alaska state employees who earlier failed to give evidence to a legislative inquiry agreed to testify on Palin's involvement in the Troopergate affair, the alleged abuse of her position as the state's governor to sack her former brother-in-law, who was involved in a child custody battle.</p>",
  "<h2>Countering Obama</h2> <p>Going negative could be John McCain's last best chance of holding on to an election that has been slipping towards Barack Obama. He can do that only by changing the conversation away from the economy towards Obama. \"They are going to try to turn this into a referendum on Obama as much as possible, and to turn it into a questioning of Obama and his character,\" said Tad Devine, who was Al Gore's chief strategist in 2000. Unlike the Democrats, who are flush with cash to spend on television advertising, McCain cannot afford to entirely outsource the dirty work. That's where Sarah Palin comes in as the McCain camp's main attack dog. The gloves-off strategy carries risks. McCain could turn off voters if he is seen as failing to engage with real issues and not putting out a strong, positive message for his own candidacy. So where will he attack Obama?</p> <h2>\"Who is Barack Obama?\"</h2> <p>That was the opening line of a new television advertisement released yesterday by the McCain camp that comes close to suggesting that Obama sees US forces in Afghanistan as war criminals. The ad ends by attacking Obama as too liberal for America. \"How dangerous,\" it says. The Republicans see Obama's unconventional political r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as his main weakness: his race and unfamiliar surname, his unfamiliarity to many American voters after just four years in national politics. Now that McCain's attempt to cast Obama as too inexperienced to lead has fallen flat, the Republican's best remaining hope is to create doubts about his opponent's character.</p> <h2>Different</h2> <p>By repeatedly accusing the Democrat of being different from other Americans, the Republicans hope to implicitly draw voters' attention to the most obvious difference of all between Obama and other presidential candidates: his race. Another way of doing that is to question Obama's patriotism. Yesterday saw Sarah Palin revisiting the controversy from last February when Michelle Obama told a rally in Wisconsin that she was proud for the first time to be an American. Palin told a rally in Florida she and her spouse, Todd, had always been proud Americans. She also said: \"I am just so fearful that this is not a man who sees America as you and I see America - as the greatest source for good in the world.\"</p> <h2>Guilt by association</h2> <p>Palin and the Republican National Committee yesterday were aggressively pursuing Obama for his association with William Ayers, a former member of the 1960s radical Weather Underground, who was involved but not convicted in a number of planned bombings. Ayers, now a university professor, lives in Chicago and hosted a get-together for Obama when he first ran for the Illinois senate in 1995. Palin, who accused Obama of \"palling around\" with a domestic terrorist yesterday, said there was more to the connection: \"Barack Obama says that Ayers was just somebody in his neighbourhood but that's less than truthful.\" Obama also faces attacks on his association with Antoin \"Tony\" Rezko, the Chicago real estate developer convicted on fraud and bribery charges last June.</p> <h2>Beliefs</h2> <p>McCain has directed his campaign to steer away from the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, the former pastor at Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago which Obama attended for nearly 20 years. Wright's pronouncements on Aids and race hurt Obama in the primaries. But while McCain may have doubts, Palin apparently does not. She told the New York Times at the weekend she thought there should be more talk on the campaign trail about Wright's views. </p> <h2>The L word</h2> <p>McCain hopes to saddle Obama with the classic baggage of liberal politicians in America: that he would raise taxes and be soft on crime. The Republican has accused Obama on the stump and in campaign advertisements of voting to raise taxes 94 times in the Senate, and seeking to raise taxes on Americans earning above $42,000. Watch groups say those claims are a distortion. Republicans also accuse Obama of being \"far outside the mainstream\" on such issues as street gangs and sentencing for drug crimes.</p>",
  "<p>Sarah Palin, who once boasted that she learned everything she needed to know about politics on the basketball court, is being underestimated by her critics. Unleashed on the campaign trail after a creditable performance against Joe Biden, Ms Palin attracts large rallies. She does not disappoint. As part of John McCain's new gloves-off strategy, she attacked Barack Obama \"for palling around with terrorists\". The terrorist she is referring to is Bill Ayers, a worthy education professor who took part in the anti-Vietnam-war protests of the Weather Underground, a group that claimed credit for bombing the Pentagon. Mr Obama was aged eight at the time. But no matter, guilt by association is what matters and, as any pollster will affirm, negative campaigning works. </p> <p>The American equivalent of what would be called on the other side of the English Channel \"la France profonde\" - xenophobic, nationalist, low-income, rural, contemptuous of the metropolitan elite - loves her, and laps up her irrelevancies such as the winks and the plain-speaking protestations: \"Now doggone it.\" The high priests of the Republican hierarchy hate her, but it would not be difficult to imagine Ms Palin being the Republican candidate for the next presidential contest. Reagan was similarly written off as a lightweight before he became president. </p> <p>No, the reason why Mr McCain and Ms Palin should have thought before taking their gloves off is the opportunity it affords their critics of dredging up the muck against them. The skeletons in Mr McCain's cupboard are more recent than the Weathermen. Does Mr McCain really want to be reminded of Charles Keating? He has already conceded that he used \"poor judgment\" in meeting federal regulators on behalf of Keating, an Arizona home-builder, later convicted of fraud, racketeering and conspiracy. Ms Palin's past will come flooding back on Friday, when an investigator hired by Alaskan lawmakers will publish his findings on whether the vice-presidential nominee put pressure on an official to fire a state trooper involved in a messy divorce with her sister.</p> <p>Mr McCain's tactics are born of desperation and will not work. The polls are increasingly against him, and new voters are flocking to the Democrat camp. Mr McCain's attempt to change the subject of the debate from the collapsing economy to Mr Obama's fitness for office is being drowned out by the ferocity of the financial crisis outside. It may be small consolation to the thousands of Americans who have lost their homes, and are about to lose their jobs, but the storm is driving the election the Democrats' way.</p>",
  "<h2>Taking on McCain</h2> <p>Barack Obama is determined not to make the same mistake as John Kerry, who lost the 2004 election because he failed to respond quickly and aggressively to Republican attacks on his character and his war record in Vietnam. The Obama camp has the resources to hit back. Strategists say he will increase advertisement spending by 20% a week until election day. The Democrats are also focusing on McCain's character - specifically his temperament, the not so subtle suggestions that at 72 he is too old to be president, and his former associations with a disgraced businessman. Strategists say the pattern of thrust and parry will continue until election day - but do not expect Obama to get involved. Obama is using television advertisements to take the fight to McCain, allowing him to remain statesmanlike and above the fray. </p> <h2>Erratic, or just too old?</h2> <p>John McCain's other big weakness as far as Obama is concerned is his reputation for losing his temper in senate committee rooms. The questions about McCain's temperament grew during last week's crisis on the Wall Street bailout. The Obama camp honed in on McCain's apparent inability to keep his cool in a new ad yesterday, painting the Republican as \"erratic in a crisis\". Campaign supporters like Claire McCaskill, a senator from Missouri, kept the line going on the chat shows: \"One day, no bailout. The next day, a bailout. One day, I'm suspending my campaign. The next day, I'm not.\" Expect renewed calls for McCain to make a full release of his medical records.</p> <h2>George Bush</h2> <p>Obama in his own pronouncements has been trying to undercut McCain's claim to be a maverick reformer by weighing him down with the legacy of George Bush. The argument also tries to defuse McCain's negative campaigns by labelling them a distraction. \"No wonder his campaign's announced a plan to turn a page on the financial crisis, distract with dishonest, dishonorable assaults against Barack Obama,\" said a new ad yesterday. \"We can't afford another president who's this out of touch.\"</p> <h2>Guilt by association</h2> <p>McCain's biggest skeleton is his intervention on behalf of Charles Keating, a campaign contributor and Arizona businessman, who was convicted of fraud in the collapse of a savings and loan institution in the 1980s. McCain met federal investigators on two occasions in 1987 at Keating's behest, earning a rebuke from the Senate ethics committee. McCain claims he learned from the mistake and that set him on his path of reform. The Obama camp yesterday released a 13-minute web documentary about Keating and sent out an email to supporters claiming \"John McCain still hasn't learned his lesson\".</p> <h2>Beliefs</h2> <p>Like Obama, McCain has a troublesome pastor in his past: the Reverend John Hagee. McCain spent more than a year courting Hagee to win his endorsement during the Republican primary, only to renounce the association last February after footage emerged of the pastor describing the Nazi holocaust as part of God's plan. The association with Hagee could hurt the Republicans in Florida, where there is a large Jewish vote. </p> <p>Sarah Palin also has a potential pastor disaster in the making, thanks to 2005 footage from her Assembly of God church in Alaska. The footage shows Palin joining a visiting pastor on stage while he denounces witchcraft. Expect more footage to emerge of Palin's own pronouncements from the pulpit as governor, including her statements about God's plan for the war in Iraq.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany's</a> go-it-alone decision to prevent a run on its banks by guaranteeing up to \u20ac1 trillion of individuals' deposits was followed yesterday by several other <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">EU countries</a>. </p> <p>But the rush to take unilateral action underlined a sense of disarray among EU governments over the crisis and the difficulties of drafting joint action. </p> <p>Amid bitter recriminations about Berlin's shock move on Sunday, Spain indicated that it could soon join Austria, Denmark, Greece, Ireland and Sweden in offering a full government guarantee for deposits. </p> <p>But Germany rowed back slightly, insisting that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was not offering a full state guarantee to all banks - just to private depositors.</p> <p>The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, the current EU president, insisted that EU leaders were acting together and would separately and collectively do whatever was necessary to ensure financial stability.</p> <p>Sarkozy and Gordon Brown spoke to Merkel by phone, requesting an explanation of the German action. The French president was also prompted to try to reassert control over a crisis spiralling out of control. \"No depositor in the banks of our countries has suffered losses and we will continue to take the necessary measures to protect the system as well as depositors,\" an Elys\u00e9e statement said later. </p> <p>\"In taking these measures, European leaders confirm the necessity of a close coordination and cooperation.\"</p> <p>But the attempt at damage limitation contrasted with growing disarray among European governments. This was highlighted when the Italian premier, Silvio Berlusconi, read out the same statement in Rome earlier as if it were his own and he were acting on the EU's behalf.</p> <p>Spain was enraged at being left out of Saturday's emergency summit of British, French, German and Italian leaders when its banks have proven safe so far, and demanded talks for its prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, with Sarkozy in Paris this week. Zapatero held an emergency meeting with leading bankers in Madrid last night.</p> <p>\"There's already been criticism of a unilateral approach and we may hear more of it,\" a senior EU diplomat said ahead of today's meeting of the EU's 27 finance ministers in Luxembourg.</p> <p>Pedro Solbes, the Spanish finance minister and a former EU commissioner, said: \"I would have preferred that no member country took decisions unilaterally which are always negative. </p> <p>\"If each country maintains its position, we'll have to look at the impact it's having on Spain.\"</p> <p>Johannes Leitenberger, chief European commission spokesman, repeatedly declared that a collective EU response remained in place yesterday, but effectively gave carte blanche for the EU's 27 countries to mount their own schemes to stop panicky depositors taking their money out of banks.</p> <p>He said there were no objections to the German and other enhanced deposit schemes - apart from the Irish plan which is viewed as discriminatory since it provides blanket guarantees for banks' entire liabilities and could exclude non-Irish banks.</p> <p>The European commission indicated that it would prepare rushed legislation to revise a 1994 law that sets a minimum \u20ac20,000 deposit guarantee throughout the EU, raising the ceiling and ensuring speedier payouts.</p> <p>A proposal is likely after today's meeting of EU finance ministers and a full EU summit in Brussels early next week at which Europe's leaders will try to contain the contagion sweeping across the Atlantic to engulf several European banks.</p> <p>Finance ministers of the 15-strong eurogroup met to prepare a collective response last night amid continuing divisions over a Dutch demand for a pan-European bank bail-out fund of around \u20ac300bn to match the US scheme approved by Congress last week.</p> <p>Giulio Tremonti, the Italian finance minister, pushed for the scheme which has had initial support from the French but was given \"a pretty comprehensive thumbs-down\" from Saturday's summit, diplomats said.</p> <p>Germany is preparing for a general election next year and is allergic to the very notion of a pan-EU fund since, as the traditional paymaster, it fears shelling out to save other countries' banks.</p> <p>With popular disgust mounting over the mismatch between the abject performance of the financial system and rewards for top bankers, ministers are debating collective measures to curb boardroom pay.</p> <p>\"A key issue is whether incentives in remuneration structures may have encouraged executives to focus on short-term profit targets rather than on the sustainable profitability of companies,\" a European commission memo said. </p> <p>Senior EU officials have accused investment bankers of simply piling up ultra-risky investments from September in order to maximise their Christmas bonuses.</p> <p>EU governments are also seeking to step up pan-European supervision of cross-border big banks in difficulties, but are at odds over French-inspired plans to establish a single EU regulator and other proposals for a \"college\" of supervisors.</p>",
  "<p>Exactly a month before the US election, Opera North has chosen to stage a rare production of this 1931 musical, scored by George Gershwin to lyrics by his brother Ira, which won a Pulitzer prize for its satirical look at a fictional presidential contest. Its satire is relatively gentle, while proposing - in timely fashion - that an attractive woman can be deployed as a vote-winner.</p> <p>Presidential candidate Wintergreen's team realises that his campaign needs some sex appeal, so a beauty contest is held, with the winner to become First Lady. Sultry southern belle Diana Devereaux triumphs as Miss Louisiana, but Wintergreen meanwhile becomes besotted with homely Mary Turner, on account of her corn-muffin-making skills, and their subsequent union results in a diplomatic contretemps with Devereaux's ancestral France.</p> <p>What satire there is descends into farce in a spun-out second act, in which Richard Suart's French ambassador provides a skilful vaudeville turn. William Dazeley deploys sufficient matinee-idol charm as the leading man and Bibi Heal's Mary Turner is suitably demure, while Heather Shipp vamps to good effect as Miss Devereaux. Nearly stealing the show, however, is Steven Beard as the shyly forgettable vice-president, Throttlebottom. It's a mark of the harmless nature of the entertainment that the election itself ignores any alternative party completely.</p> <p>In terms of technical skill, Gershwin's score is several cuts above his Broadway competitors, showing a far wider awareness of harmonic and rhythmic possibilities - yet only in two or three places, notably the glamorous title song, does he really come up with the melodic goods. But Caroline Gawn's pacey staging costumes and Caroline Pope's choreography deliver, while conductor Mark W Dorrell and the Opera North forces seize their opportunities.</p>",
  "<p>With just four weeks until the presidential election, John McCain's campaign is becoming increasingly desperate. It seems they now feel that without the use of swiftboating tactics, McCain doesn't have a hope in hell of getting into the Oval Office.</p> <p>Over the weekend, Sarah Palin addressed Republicans in California, Texas and Nebraska. Coming just a few days after Congress passed an unprecedented $700bn bail-out plan for Wall Street, you'd think that the economy would be at the forefront of Palin's mind and that she'd be concerned with reassuring American taxpayers that they will never again have to bear the burden for corporate greed. But no!</p> <p>Instead, the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/03/AR2008100303738.html\">Republicans decided to change the subject</a> to Obama's extremely <a href=\"http://blog.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2008/02/obamas_weatherman_connection.html\">tenuous</a> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0208/8630.html\">association with the controversial 1960s left-wing activist Bill Ayers</a>. \"Our opponent though is someone who sees America, it seems, as being so imperfect that he's palling around with terrorists who would target their own country,\" <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081004/ap_on_el_pr/palin_obama\">Palin said at a fundraiser in Denver </a>on Saturday. She <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/04/palin-obama-is-palling-around-with-terrorists/\">repeated the claim at a rally in California</a> on Sunday. \"Turns out one of his earliest supporters is a man, who according to the New York Times, was a domestic terrorist,\" she said.</p> <p>By choosing to focus on irrelevant topics such as Obama's alleged friendship with Ayers \u2013 which Obama has repudiated \u2013 the Republicans are showing America that their campaign is so vacuous and unsubstantial when it comes to matters of substance that this is all they are able to draw attention to. The truth is that if McCain and Palin genuinely had anything different to offer from what George Bush has been giving America for the past eight years, particularly in this economically unstable time, they would tell everyone about it in no uncertain terms. But they aren't talking about the things that matter because they don't have anything to say. </p> <p>It seems that character assassination is the area of expertise in which they hope to be able to win the presidency. While some of the more hardcore Republican voters may be reassured by this, it will probably do little to comfort anyone else that McCain and Palin have what it takes to deal effectively with the range of serious issues that they would inherit should McCain become president. </p> <p>According to McCain's advisers, this is <a href=\"http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2008/10/barack_obama_john_mccain_campa.html\">part of a new strategy</a> aimed at \"looking to turning the page on this financial crisis and getting back to discussing Mr Obama's liberal, aggressively liberal, record and how he will be too risky for the Americans\". Notwithstanding the fact that the Republicans believe that lies about Obama's friendships are more important than the reality of the current economic crisis, there is nothing new about Obama-targeted character smears. </p> <p>Falsehoods about Obama being an un-American, unpatriotic Muslim have been bandied about throughout this campaign. Nevertheless, he has managed to get past all of those charges virtually unscathed, remaining, more or less, consistently ahead of McCain in the polls since he became the Democratic nominee. It's therefore rather pathetic that the Republicans feel the need to regurgitate these accusations when it has already been shown that they don't really work. It is simply, as Obama also said this weekend, \"what you do when you're out of touch, out of ideas and running out of time.\"</p> <p>Using the vice-presidential candidate to play bad cop is a common tactic. With a month to go before the election, it was also to be expected that the Republicans would start to play dirty. With Palin's sharply falling popularity, however, it is possible \u2013 and probable - that her comments could <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1847376,00.html\">seriously backfire</a>. Already it is being suggested that her accusations <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hLxEMDD-UlNa6HUrozE6ZkGYPTqAD93KDRUO0\">carry a racial undertone</a>, while Republican commentators such as strategist Mike Murphy have also said that focusing on Obama's character is, at this time, a risky strategy for the Republicans. Speaking on MSNBC's Meet the Press programme on Sunday, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27034205/page/2/\">Murphy wisely said</a>: \"I think [focusing on the liberal nature of the Democrats] is a better prosecution for the McCain campaign than these character attacks or these dubious association, you know, background issues and Obama. \u2026 I don't think that's the key when everybody in the country, at least the swing voters that are going to control the election, are very much worried about the economy.\"</p> <p>The Republicans hope that focusing on Obama's association with Ayers (and no doubt the other characters that they will bring to the fore over the next few weeks) will raise questions about his judgement, seemingly forgetting that Palin herself is, among other things, a living display of McCain's own questionable judgement. She's not \u2013 as they have tried to suggest Ayres is to Obama - just an acquaintance, but his pick to be vice-president of the US, a matter with much more serious ramifications for the American people. </p> <p>Furthermore, with the findings of Palin's involvement in the Troopergate scandal due to be released soon, the Republicans may do well to remember the saying that people in glass houses should not throw stones.</p>",
  "<p>As the Obama and McCain campaigns roll out duelling character attacks based on each candidate's association with a controversial figure in recent US history -- for Obama, former 1960s radical <a href=\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/10/05/1495110.aspx\">Bill Ayers</a>; for McCain, disgraced banking magnate <a href=\"http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2008/10/obama_attacks_mccain_on_keatin.html\">Charles Keating</a> -- it's worth noting that the current credit crisis bears more than just a passing similarity to the savings-and-loan debacle that ensnared McCain.</p> <p>We <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/01/uselections2008.creditcrunch\">reported last week</a> on McCain's support for suspending so-called \"mark-to-market\" accounting rules, a move that could allow companies to hide the plummeting value of their riskier assets -- the same sort of shell game that savings-and-loan institutions performed in the Keating years.</p> <p>But the Los Angeles Times <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-fi-bankcop6-2008oct06,0,507232,full.story\">has an illuminating take</a> today on an even more glaring Keating flashback: Darrel Dochow, the banking regulator <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEEDE123CF933A25754C0A96F948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all\">who was parachuted in</a> to conduct a favourable investigation of Keating's toxic S&amp;L, was the western chief of the current US banking regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision, during the failures of IndyMac and Washington Mutual.</p> <p>For anyone wondering how the bygone Keating affair relates to the present economic meltdown, the Times piece is a must-read.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama is determined not to make the same mistake as John Kerry who lost the 2004 elections because he failed to respond quickly and aggressively to Republican attacks on his character and his war record in Vietnam.</p> <p>The Obama camp - which has far out-raised McCain - has the resources to hit back. Strategists say he will increase advertisement spending by 20% a week until election day.</p> <p>The Democrats are also focusing on McCain's character - specifically his temperament, and not-so-subtle suggestions that at 72 he is too old to be president. They are also bringing out a skeleton from McCain's closet: his association with an Arizona businessman who was jailed for fraud.</p> <p>Strategists say the pattern of thrust and parry will continue until election day - but do not expect Obama to get involved.</p> <p>Obama is using television advertisements to take the fight to McCain, allowing him to remain statesmanlike and above the fray. \"We're not going to let John McCain distract us,\" he told a rally in North Carolina.</p> <p><strong>Erratic, or just too old?</strong><br>John McCain's other big weakness so far as Obama is concerned is his reputation for losing his temper in Senate committee rooms. </p> <p>The questions about McCain's temperament grew during last week's crisis on the Wall Street bail-out. The Obama camp honed in on McCain's apparent inability to keep his cool in a new ad today painting the Republican as \"erratic in a crisis\". </p> <p>Campaign supporters like Claire McCaskill, a senator from Missouri, kept the line going on the chat shows: \"One day, no bail-out. The next day, a bail-out. One day, I'm suspending my campaign. The next day, I'm not.\" Expect renewed calls for McCain to make a full release of his medical records.</p> <p><strong>George Bush</strong><br>Obama in his own pronouncements has been trying to undercut McCain's claim to be a maverick reformer by weighing him down with the legacy of George Bush. </p> <p>The argument also tries to defuse McCain's negative campaigns by labelling them a distraction. \"No wonder his campaign's announced a plan to turn a page on the financial crisis, distract with dishonest, dishonorable assaults against Barack Obama,\" said a new ad today. \"We can't afford another president who's this out of touch.\"</p> <p><strong>Guilt by association - Charles Keating</strong><br>McCain's biggest skeleton is his intervention on behalf of Charles Keating, a campaign contributor and Arizona businessman who was convicted of fraud in the collapse of a savings and loan in the 1980s. </p> <p>McCain met federal investigators on two occasions in 1987 at Keating's behest, earning a rebuke from the Senate ethics committee. McCain claims he learned from the mistake, and that set him on his path of reform.</p> <p>The Obama camp today released a 13-minute web documentary about Keating and sent out an email to supporters claiming: \"John McCain still hasn't learned his lesson.\"</p> <p><strong>Beliefs</strong><br>Like Obama, McCain too has a troublesome pastor in his past: the Reverend John Hagee. McCain actively spent more than a year courting Hagee to win his endorsement during the Republican primary, only to renounce the association last February after footage emerged of the pastor describing the Nazi holocaust as part of God's plan. </p> <p>The association with Hagee could hurt the Republicans in Florida, where there is a large Jewish vote.</p> <p>Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin also has a potential pastor disaster in the making, thanks to 2005 footage from her Assembly of God church in Alaska. </p> <p>The footage shows Palin joining a visiting pastor on stage while he denounces witchcraft. Expect more footage to emerge of Palin's own pronouncements from the pulpit as governor, including her statements about God's plan for the war in Iraq.</p>",
  "<p>When <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com\">eBay</a> started, it liked being a bit scruffy. It let any old Joe make money out of the crap in his garage. It was happy to be the internet's car boot sale - and that image did pretty well for the company. But in recent years, eBay has been hinting that it's morelike Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady - a bit of posh in the guise of a backstreet scrubber; something classier than we ever imagined. How? By buying other companies in an attempt trying to prove that it's got more than just secondhand auctions up its sleeve.</p> <p>Proving that to the public is not coming easy, though, and eBay has been locked in a downward spiral for some time. So when the news emerged today that the company <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/06/ebay.technology\">was laying off 1,000 members of staff</a>, it was a disappointment but not a surprise. What used to be an auction house for the rest of us has now become a treasure trove of weird investments and bad decisions.</p> <p>Yes, it made sense to buy <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>, the internet payment service, for $1.5bn back in 2002. But $2.6bn for Skype, the internet phone company? And $75m on StumbleUpon, which lets users rate web pages and surf to new sites? Rumour has it that eBay's trying to sell off these properties. Perhaps you should wait until the guide price is low enough and make a bid yourself.</p> <p>That's not all that eBay's bosses have done to try and take the company to new heights. They've also fundamentally changed the business that they were in, gouging their biggest fans and undermining their own strengths. </p> <p>First they cosied up to the bigger retailers, letting them ditch the auction model in favour of \"Buy It Now\" - straightforward selling. That <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/20/ebay.efinance\">didn't go down well</a> with core buyers and sellers. Nor did the idea of raising fees, which was met with anger and consternation. A sweep of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/feb/21/ebay.consumeraffairs\">other changes</a> hasn't helped.</p> <p>It looks as though none of these plans has worked. The company's still desperate to shake off its roots and become legit (hence the move into financial services with the $1.3bn purchase of <a href=\"http://www.billmelater.com\">Bill Me Later</a>, a backhanded slap to those 1,000 sacked workers). </p> <p>Where does the blame lie? Well, it's current CEO John Donahoe who's going to take most of the flak over the redundancies. But one person who should take responsibility is former chief executive Meg Whitman.</p> <p>Whitman, an ardent Republican who is being touted as a potential secretary of commerce if John McCain wins the presidential election, presided over the company's rise and fall for a decade before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jan/22/ebay.whitman\">stepping down earlier this year</a>. At the point she left, it was clear that eBay was in trouble \u2013 but she managed to avoid the worst press by handing off to her successor. </p> <p>Perhaps it's time for eBay to realise that it doesn't need to be better than it is. Perhaps they should take note that every time they try to create the company anew, they lose a little more of what made it special in the first place.</p> <p>In the end, perhaps they have to give up that Audrey Hepburn dream. After all, the top brass at eBay think they're Eliza Doolittle - but really they're just Hyacinth Bucket.</p>",
  "<p>Going negative could be John McCain's last best chance of holding on to an election that has been slipping towards Barack Obama.</p> <p>He can do that only by changing the conversation away from the economy towards Obama. \"They are going to try to turn this into a referendum on Obama as much as possible, and to turn it into a questioning of Obama and his character,\" said Tad Devine, who was Al Gore's chief strategist in 2000.</p> <p>Unlike the Democrats, who are flush with cash to spend on television advertising, McCain cannot afford to entirely outsource the dirty work.</p> <p>That's where Sarah Palin comes in. The McCain camp has designated Palin its main attack dog, counting on media fascination with the vice-presidential candidate to get its negative message out.</p> <p>The gloves-off strategy carries risks. McCain could turn off voters if he is seen as failing to engage with the real issues. He also does not have the resources to put out a counter-balancing strong positive message for his own candidacy.</p> <p><strong>\"Who is Barack Obama?\"</strong><br>That was the opening line of a new television advertisement released today by the McCain camp that comes close to suggesting that Obama sees US forces in Afghanistan as war criminals. The ad ends by attacking Obama as too liberal for America. \"How dangerous,\" it says.</p> <p>The Republicans see Obama's unconventional political resume as his main weakness: his race and unfamiliar surname, his unfamiliarity to many American voters after just four years in national politics.</p> <p>Now that McCain's attempt to cast Obama as too inexperienced to lead has fallen flat, the Republican's best remaining hope is to create doubts about his opponent's character.</p> <p><strong>Different</strong><br>By repeatedly accusing the Democrat of being different from other Americans, the Republicans hope to implicitly draw voters' attention to the most obvious difference of all between Obama and other presidential candidates: his race. </p> <p>Another way of doing that is to question Obama's patriotism. Today saw Sarah Palin revisiting the controversy from last February when Michelle Obama told a rally in Wisconsin that she was proud for the first time to be an American. </p> <p>Palin told a rally in Florida she and her spouse, Todd, had always been proud Americans. She also said: \"I am just so fearful that this is not a man who sees America as you and I see America as the greatest source for good in the world.\"</p> <p><strong>Guilt by association</strong><br>Palin and the Republican National Committee today were aggressively pursuing Obama for his association with William Ayers, a former member of the 60s radical Weather Underground, who was involved but not convicted of in a number of planned bombings. </p> <p>Ayers, now a university professor, lives in Chicago and hosted a get-together for Obama when he first ran for the Illinois senate in 1995. </p> <p>Palin, who accused Obama of \"palling around\" with a domestic terrorist today said there was more to the connection. \"Barack Obama says that Ayers was just somebody in his neighbourhood but that's less than truthful.\"</p> <p>Obama also faces attacks on his association with Antoin \"Tony\" Rezko, the Chicago real estate developer convicted on fraud and bribery charges last June.</p> <p><strong>Beliefs</strong><br>McCain has directed his campaign to steer away from the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, the former pastor at Trinity United Church in Chicago which Obama attended for nearly 20 years. </p> <p>Wright's pronouncements on Aids and race hurt Obama in the primaries. But while McCain may have doubts, Palin apparently does not. She told the New York Times at the weekend she thought there should be more talk on the campaign trail of Wright's views.</p> <p>Democrats also expect Wright to loom large in the final weeks of the campaign in advertisements produced by allied groups who are not operating under the same financial constraints as McCain.</p> <p><strong>The L word</strong><br>McCain hopes to saddle Obama with the classical baggage of liberal politicians in America: that he would raise taxes and be soft on crime. </p> <p>The Republican has accused Obama on the stump and in campaign advertisements of voting to raise taxes 94 times in the Senate, and seeking to raise taxes on Americans earning above $42,000. </p> <p>Watchgroups say those claims are a distortion. Republicans also accuse Obama of being \"far outside the mainstream\" on such issues as street gangs and sentencing for drug crimes. Both issues have racial overtones.</p>",
  "<p>The always edifying Nate Silver <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/in-georgia-small-improvements-in-black.html\">runs some numbers</a> on Georgia and how a huge black turnout could make things very interesting:</p> <blockquote> <p>Think these numbers sound unreasonable? Early voting is underway in Georgia, and according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, black voters do not represent 30 percent of Georgia's early voter turnout. Instead, they represent almost 40 percent. Although early voting figures can be idiosyncratic , Barack Obama certainly seems to be having little trouble getting his vote out. Indeed, Barack Obama is winning Georgia right now. </p> </blockquote> <p>Now, don't get me wrong, I'd be insanely shocked if Obama won Georgia. But read what Silver has to say about black voter enrollment and possible turnout and apply the logic to other states where polls are closer, notably Virginia and North Carolina -- and Ohio. In Ohio, Bush won 16% of the black vote in 2004. Obviously John McCain won't come close to that. I've run some back-of-the-envelope numbers and it seems that Obama could win about 200,000 more black votes in Ohio than Kerry did. That's a lot of votes, even in a large state. Not saying all this <em>will</em> happen, you understand, but certainly black turnout will be far higher than it's ever been.<br></p>",

Above: the McCain campaign's new TV spot, entitled Dangerous, which -- can you guess? -- quotes Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/14/AR2007081400812.html\">completely out of context</a> on Afghanistan. And below, the Obama campaign's web documentary on the Keating Five scandal (in which five US senators, including McCain, were accused of improperly seeking to get special treatment for a campaign contributor whose fraud was at the heart of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_Loan_crisis\">savings-and-loan crisis</a>; McCain, eventually, was officially found to have shown only 'poor judgment'). The video is a borderline hilarious compendium of thriller-movie cliches, including the well-worn \"sinister vibraphone music\" gambit, and the \"camera shutter\" sound-effect used to imply that somebody's up to something. But it's also a powerful, albeit entirely partisan, condemnation of McCain's role in the affair. As a matter of campaign tactics, though, one can't help observing that the McCain ad is 35 seconds long, whereas the Obama documentary is 13 minutes, and that one of these might be better suited to today's cable-news-driven, ultra-low-attention-span political culture than the other...</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/g72BuIvMbWY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/g72BuIvMbWY&rel=0&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/g72BuIvMbWY&rel=0&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"385\"></embed></object> </figure>",
  "<p>\"Hell no!\" said the man with the long beard from his half opened doorway.</p> <p>Meghan Schertz's Obama badge had unleashed a torrent of invective.</p> <p>\"No Obama,\" he kept shouting, while Meghan struggled to finish a sentence. \"I don't need to hear nothing from you Obama people.\"</p> <p>\"Do you see the fucking Nader sign,\" he bellowed, pointing to his yard sign which bared the name of the perennial independent candidate, Ralph Nader. \"There's your answer.\"</p> <p>\"So you're an independent then,\" asked Meghan, as though engaged in rational conversation.</p> <p>\"Get you're ass off my property before I get my shot gun,\" said the tourretic Nader supporter. And so we left. As we circled back along the street the man sat at a table in his driveway. </p> <p>Cheekily, I waved my hand at him. Menacingly, he waved his gun at me.</p> <p>An afternoon out with an Obama canvasser is an education in the leg work, patience and resilience it takes for the Democratic presidential contender's strategy work. </p> <p>It took about an hour and half to visit a designated number of houses in just a few streets in the Washington Heights area of Roanoke - a racially mixed middle-class part of town. </p> <p>In a bid to identify Obama's base so they can make sure they maximise their turnout on polling day, she asks them who they are going to support, how strong their support is, whether they are sure to turn up on election day and if they would like some literature. </p> <p>Or at least she tries to. One man took one look at Meghan and, before she could open her mouth, said: \"I don't want to talk about it,\" and then went back inside. </p> <p>Another woman refused to open the door but shouted from her window.</p> <p>\"I'm for Obama, so go on now.\"</p> <p>After many weekends' campaigning Schertz anticipates the response she's going to get as she walks up the driveway from the kind of cars people drive and other signifiers - a mixture of prejudice and defence mechanism. </p> <p>But it doesn't always work. The home with two pick-up trucks bearing Harley Davidson stickers are leaning Obama. And who knew that a Nader sign would produce a gun-toting misanthrope.</p> <p>But there are moments that have the smack of meaningful if minor achievement. With a day to go before the registration deadline Schertz also carries registration forms just in case. She gives some advice to a woman who is worried that her son's registration has his middle name wrong - the kind of discrepancy that could play havoc on election day. </p> <p>In Virginia where if you don't vote for more than four years you fall off the voter rolls, some are not sure if they are registered or not. </p> <p>And then there's the information that goes back to town office about where the base is, that will be punched into the computer providing the raw data on which the campaign's logistical efforts hinge. It all happens on such a small scale that you couldn't do it unless you thought you were part of something bigger. </p> <p>Schertz, whose run-in with the Nader voter ultimately only provided more raw material for her good humour, has never been involved in an election campaign before. </p> <p>In the primaries she supported Hillary Clinton. \"There's too much at stake to sit this one out,\" she says.</p> <p>A look at the big picture suggests that these small efforts are paying off for Obama. <a href=\"http://www.sbe.virginia.gov/cms/documents/2008_Statistics/Oct/Statewide_Statistics_by_Locality.pdf\">Numbers</a> released by the Virginia state board of elections for September show that the increase in the number of registered voters in Roanoke city, which is Democratic and one quarter black, is more than double that of Roanoke county, which is Republican and 5% black over the past year. </p> <p>Over the past month the city has seen more than three times the increase of registered voters as the county. This reflects a trend that is both <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/10/02/obama_campaign_clears_its_va_v.html\"> statewide</a> and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/05/AR2008100502524.html?hpid=top\">nationwide</a> news with traditionally Democratic areas far exceeding Republican areas and, where you can register by party, Democrats massively outpacing Republicans. </p> <p>With voter registration drawing to a <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-10-05-voterreg_N.htm\">close</a> all over the country this marks the end of the beginning for Obama's ground game. </p> <p>His task was to not just to win over the electorate but to expand it and therefore change the calculus. So far so good. </p> <p>Now comes the hard work. Keeping them energised and making sure that they show up. The Obama campaign predict that 80% of the new registered voters in Virginia are Democrats and that three quarters of them will show up on election day. </p> <p>Which brings us to the final challenge. Making sure that the votes are <a href=\"http://www.toledofreepress.com/2008/10/03/court-curbs-move-to-exclude-voters/\">counted</a>.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain on public television, February 21:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Uh, I, I just have to rely on the good judgment of the voters not to buy into these negative attack ads. Sooner or later, people are going to figure out if all you run is negative attack ads you don't have much of a vision for the future or you're not ready to articulate it.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The record shows, of course, that right now, as Greg Sargent <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/mccain_campaigns_ad_spending_n.php\">wrote at TPM</a> last week:</p> <blockquote> <p>The McCain campaign has now shifted virtually 100 percent of his national ad spending into negative ads attacking Obama, a detailed breakdown of his ad buys reveals.</p> <p>By contrast, the Obama campaign is devoting less than half of its overall ad spending to ads attacking McCain. More than half of its spending is going to a spot that doesn't once mention his foe.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here's a prediction for you. If McCain loses, sometime next year -- he'll let some time pass; say, late next summer, during a slow news week -- he'll choose a sympathetic interviewer and come forward, hat in hand, offer an apology for the kind of campaign he ran, swearing that it was all out of character not reflective of his true self, and deeply, deeply regrets the kinds of things modern-day politics \"forces\" candidates to do. </p> <p>Another prediction: Some suckers in the media will eat it up, too.<br></p>",

(The picture above is just a small portion of the graphic, which compares the heights and weights of the contenders in every American presidential election since 1896.) The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/13/mccainstinyproblem\">presidential height index</a> has long shown us that taller candidates have an unfair advantage in US presidential elections, which would seem to pose a significant problem for John 'Bonsai' McCain -- but could things be even worse? The shorter candidate does sometimes win, as in 2000 and 2004, but McCain is also the lighter of the two men, and this chart demonstrates that the shorter <em>and</em> lighter candidate has only won once in modern times, when Truman defeated Dewey in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._presidential_election,_1948\">famous upset election of 1948</a>.

  "<p>In my Philadelphia home the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/audio\">radio</a> is perma-tuned to <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/ \">National Public Radio</a> - the subsidised network whose gently burbling collegiate conservatism is all but indistinguishable from the BBC World Service. But now and then - when NPR's touchy-feely niceness gets a bit much - I switch over to the dark side. By which I mean rightwing talk radio. </p> <p>The last time was on the day of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/apr/23/uselections2008.hillaryclinton1 .\">the Pennsylvanian Democratic primaries</a>. It was a sad and disturbing experience. Rightwing talk radio seemed to be suffering from a crisis of confidence. One commentator tried to make a case for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Obama</a> being an elitist. Because he'd used the word \"buffet\". </p> <p>Gone was the on-message swagger that had infused talk radio since the time of <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=su1CDbnBxzg\">Newt Gingrich's Contract With America</a>, and it wasn't hard to figure out why. The news spoke volumes about the collapse of American conservatism: rising gas prices, falling house prices, school shootings, a collapsing stock market, two more marines dead in Iraq - and a conservative religious cult allegedly raping their kids down in Texas.</p> <p>The ads were even more revealing. Credit card debt relief scams, get-rich-quick schemes, teenage celibacy programs, gun safes, how to tame your kids, help with addiction to prescription drugs and <a href=\"http://www.colonhealthmagazine.com/colon-products-review/evercleanse.html\">EverCleanse</a> - guaranteed to remove the \"20 to 25 pounds of unwanted waste that some experts say is trapped in your body\".</p> <p>The medium was totally at odd with the message, as if Joseph Goebbels' propaganda speeches were punctuated with ads for Swiss bank accounts, bomb shelters and quick'n'easy Russian language lessons. </p> <p>Last week \u2013 amidst more economic collapse and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin's</a> disastrous interview on CBS News - I decided to stick my head back inside the rightwing talk radio bubble. </p> <p>The news is still terrible. And the ads are still targeted at debt-ridden gun-owners with compacted fecal matter clinging to their colon walls. But there was a bounce to rightwing talk.</p> <p>Last week saw the vice presidential debate. And Sarah Palin did not drool. This is hailed as a major victory. <a href=\"http://townhall.com/Columnists/MikeGallagher/2008/03/07/barack_hussein_obama\">Michael Gallagher</a> says \"Barack 'I don't mind babies being allowed to die on a table during partial birth abortions' Obama\" must be quaking. </p> <p>\"She didn't hit it out of the park,\" says Mike. \"But she didn't need to hit it out of the park.\" </p> <p>\"She hit it out of the park!\" crows a listener. </p> <p>\"Yes she did,\" agrees Mike. \"She hit it out of the park.\"</p> <p>Palin starts the day as the totally-out-of-her-depth local politician. She ends it a cross between Joan of Arc and Babe Ruth. </p> <p>Gallagher is meantime feigning outrage that Obama supporters are planning to protest outside a Palin/McCain attended event. Because protest is undemocratic. He then learns that the Obama supporters are outnumbered by Palin/McCain counter-demonstrators. This causes Gallagher to reminisce about the time he bussed a bunch of \"patriotic Americans\" down to Bush's pseudo-ranch in Crawford Texas to harass <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/dec/09/usa.iraq\">Cindy Sheehan</a> - the anti-war protester who lost a son in Iraq - with chants of \"we don't care\". Good times, good times \u2026</p> <p>But this is all just a warm up for the main event, the man who embodies rightwing talk radio - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/01/radio.usa \">Rush Limbaugh</a>. </p> <p>Rush limbers up with an all-out assault on the number one problem facing America after eight years of George W Bush - socialism. </p> <p>That's why Katie Couric of CBS news ambushed Palin \"with her gotcha questions and her ghoulish follow-ups and her even more vicious editing\" because \"we are up against a party and a press that is of one mind, that sees an historic opportunity here to advance their far left radical agenda\". </p> <p>Rush may be cockahoop for Palin: </p> <p>\"Holy cow! Hubba hubba, dooba dooba \u2026 How great this woman could be if she was let loose \u2026\" </p> <p>But it's on the economy that Rush gets really trippy. </p> <p>\"Nobody talks about what got us into this problem in the first place,\" says Rush. </p> <p>Can you guess what that that thing was? It was \"loaning money to minorities and poor people who could not pay it back. This was Marxist social engineering. This was affirmative action via mortgage.\"</p> <p>And then he mock-whispers: \"But nobody dares say it!\" </p> <p>This is <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/10/02/limbaugh/\">the same Rush Limbaugh</a> who accused the Philadelphia Eagles' Donovan McNabb of being an affirmative action quarterback. </p> <p>And Barack Obama of being <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lovF-f8bkTU\">an affirmative action candidate</a>. </p> <p>And who refers to his black listeners as \"brothers and sisters from the hood\". And has repeatedly played the comedy track <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6642029.stm\">Barack the Magic Negro</a>. </p> <p>Then Rush - who is incredibly rich - brings it all together. Quoting extensively from an article by \"swift boat author\" Brad O'Leary (whose new book, The Audacity of Deceit: Barack Obama's War on American Values, has just been published), Rush burbles about Obama's \"war on success\", the victims of which are \"successful, hardworking, tax-paying Americans\".</p> <p>\"Oh my God, I think I'm going to be sick,\" says my wife. Me, I feel like I'm tripping. </p> <p>Then you start to realise what a genius this man is. No matter how wrong he is proved, Rush Limbaugh is always able to soothe American conservatives by pointing his finger.</p> <p>It's not your fault, he tells his listeners. It's the others. The poor, the working class, the minorities. And big government. </p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.psychologytoday.com/blog/brainstorm/200810/of-jock-straps-and-conspiracy-theories\">Recent research</a> has suggested a link between powerlessness and a tendency to believe in \"magical thinking\". Rush could have told them that for free.</p> <p>It's no wonder he's a multimillionaire. Rush is OxyContin soup for the conservative soul.</p>",
  "<p>US administrations typically suffer temporary loss of international influence as their time in office draws to a close. But rarely has Washington's global prestige and leverage fallen so low as in the dog days of George Bush's eight-year reign. </p> <p>This debilitation is a source of concern for America's friends - and a dangerous opportunity for its enemies, who hope such weakness can be both exploited and made permanent.</p> <p>The US-triggered economic crisis has reinforced hostile perceptions of American vulnerability. Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, recently gleefully invited his countrymen to listen to the sound of a global power crashing to the ground. Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, senior adviser to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told a prayer meeting that Bush's reported refusal to back an Israeli military strike on Iran was another sign of failing American will.</p> <p>Nateq-Nuri claimed Washington's \"retreat\" showed that overall US and European support for Israel was diminishing. \"It seems that Israel is approaching its expiry date and is no longer of any use to the west - and that the west is trying to collaborate in a plot to expose Israel to destruction.\"</p> <p>Seen from Washington, this interpretation of events looks patently absurd. Yet at the same time, the fact that a highly placed regime figure in Tehran apparently believes a future attempt to destroy Israel would meet with reduced resistance from the western powers is deeply worrying.</p> <p>Vladimir Putin is aggressively exploiting Bush's lame duck troubles in his bid to reassert Moscow's great power status. Analysts suggest Russia's invasion of Georgia in August was based in part on calculations, vindicated by ensuing events, that Bush would be unwilling or unable to react forcefully.</p> <p>Now Russia's prime minister appears to be threatening Ukraine, accusing its president, Viktor Yushchenko, of sending weapons and military personnel to help Georgia. \"When people and military systems are used to kill Russian soldiers, it's a crime,\" he said last week. </p> <p>The US Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, is warning that Putin is encouraging the ethnic Russian population of Ukraine's Crimea region, where Russia's Black Sea fleet is based, to break with Kiev. But at present, the US is mostly a spectator.</p> <p>Russia's president, Dmitri Medvedev, is meanwhile busily rubbing American noses in the financial dirt - and pointing to long-term strategic consequences of the crisis. \"The times when one economy and one country dominated are gone for good,\" Medvedev said. </p> <p>To American ears, his words uncomfortably echoe Germany's finance minister, Peer Steinbrueck, an ostensible ally, who predicted \"the US will lose its superpower status in the world financial system\". Americans have been reminded that Schadenfreude is, after all, a German word.</p> <p>Some countries are seeking shorter-term advantage from America's troubles. North Korea may be counting on a new, possibly Democratic administration to gain a more favourable nuclear disarmament deal. Similar considerations by interested parties have helped freeze the Middle East peace process.</p> <p>But uncertainty over America's \u2014 and its allies' \u2014 will to win in Afghanistan (fuelled in recent days by British commanders and diplomats), and over how quickly the US will get out of Iraq, is affecting longer-term political calculations in Islamabad, Kabul and Baghdad. </p> <p>It may be encouraging the Taliban and al-Qaida in their escalating campaigns of violence. They read the newspapers and the internet too. And with America's purse strings already tightly stretched, they must wonder, along with many US voters, whether a new administration can afford the additional tens of billions of dollars needed to pursue two unpopular wars.</p> <p>In America's backyard, ideological enemies such as Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the Venezuelan president, are hoping for a permanent shift in power in a region historically dominated by the US. \"The world will never be the same after this crisis,\" Ch\u00e1vez said during a visit to Brazil. \"A new world order has to emerge and it is a multipolar world. We are decoupling from the wagon of death.\" </p> <p>His host, the Brazilian president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, complained bitterly that Washington spent years telling Latin America how to get its economic house in order - and then ignored its own advice.</p> <p>Despite all the weaknesses, short-term and strategic, it would be foolish to start writing obituaries for American power. According to the Bosnian war peacemaker Richard Holbrooke, writing in Foreign Affairs, \"the next president will inherit a more difficult opening-day set of international problems than any of his predecessors since at least the end of the second world war\".</p> <p>But Holbrooke, tipped as a possible secretary of state in an Obama administration, warned that current problems should be kept in perspective and suggested America's ambition remained undiminished. The next president, he said, would inherit \"a nation that is still the most powerful in the world - a nation rich with the continued promise of its dynamic and increasingly diverse population, a nation that could, and must again, inspire, mobilise and lead the world\".</p>",

(It's featured in <a href=\"http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/presidentvalg-2008/artikkel.php?artid=527005\">VG</a>, the country's biggest-selling newspaper, and translated, invaluably, by <a href=\"http://leishacamden.blogspot.com/2008/10/not-that-it-matters.html\">Leisha Camden</a>.) It begins one day 20 years ago, in Miami airport:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>Mary Menth Andersen was 31 years old at the time, and had just married Norwegian Dag Andersen. She was looking forward to starting a new life in \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand in Vestfold with him. But first she had to get all of her belongings across to Norway... At the airport in Miami things were hectic as usual, with long lines at the check-in counters. When it was finally Mary's turn and she had placed her luggage on the baggage line, she got the message that would crush her bubbling feeling of happiness. \"You'll have to pay a $103 surcharge if you want to bring both those suitcases to Norway,\" the man behind the counter said.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>But Mary had no money, and no friends she could call; the man behind the counter wasn't willing to negotiate. \"I was completely desperate, and tried to think which of my things I could manage without,\" she recalls: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"I started to cry. Tears were pouring down my face and I had no idea what to do. Then I heard a gentle and friendly voice behind me saying 'That's OK, I'll pay for her.'\" Mary turned around to see a tall man whom she had never seen before.</p> </blockquote> <p>That's right, everyone: John McCain. No, not really! John McCain is not tall, and if he'd been held up in an airport queue he'd be boiling with rage at this point.</p> <blockquote> <p>He was nicely dressed, fashionably dressed with brown leather shoes, a cotton shirt open at the throat, and khaki pants, says Mary. She was thrilled to be able to bring both her suitcases to Norway, and assured the stranger that he would get his money back. The man wrote his name and address on a piece of paper that he gave to Mary. She thanked him repeatedly. When she finally walked off towards the security checkpoint, he waved goodbye to her.</p> <p>The piece of paper said \"Barack Obama.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Mary eventually paid the young community organiser back, and years later, her parents exchanged correspondence with Obama. Mary and her husband now have the letter. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338325654\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/6/1223304859433/couple.jpg\" alt=\"Couple\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Due to having had my soul almost entirely corroded with cynicism as a result of working too long as a journalist, I feel a barely resistible urge to be sarcastic about this story. But it's kind of touching, actually. Read the rest at <a href=\"http://leishacamden.blogspot.com/2008/10/not-that-it-matters.html\">Leisha Camden's blog</a>. And start guessing how it'll be incorporated into Sarah Palin's next stump speech, because don't you think Americans deserve to know that Barack Obama is a man who thinks the United States is so imperfect that he's willing to lend people money to help them leave it to go to Europe, or wherever the darn heck Norway is?</p>",

  "<p>Here at RealClimate we understandably have an intense interest in the positions of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates regarding global warming and carbon emissions. What the stance bodes for future action on climate change is consequential in itself, but beyond that the ability to use sound science in this case serves as a bellweather for the candidates' whole approach to science. Whatever else you can say about the candidates, it has been encouraging that both John McCain and Barack Obama favour mandatory action to reduce US carbon emissions.</p> <p>But, enter governor Sarah Palin, McCain's pick for VP. Palin's position on global warming has been stated quite clearly <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/headlines/sarah_palin_vp/2008/08/29/126139.html\">in this recent interview with the publication Newsmax</a>, where she says: \"A changing environment will affect Alaska more than any other state, because of our location. I'm not one though who would attribute it to being man-made.\" How is this to be reconciled with McCain's position? Do they just agree to differ? What does this bode for future actions if McCain were to win the election, especially in view of the fact that, in a Cheney-esque way, Palin is likely to be put in charge of energy policy? The recent vice-presidential debate sheds some light on the issue. A <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/10/03/america/03debate-transcript.php\">full transcript of the debate is here</a>.</p> <p>Palin seems to be attempting to defuse the whole issue by claiming the cause doesn't matter. When the moderator asked her: \"What is true and what is false about what we have heard, read, discussed, debated about the causes of climate change,\" Palin responded as follows:</p> <p>\"PALIN: Yes. Well, as the nation's only Arctic state and being the governor of that state, Alaska feels and sees impacts of climate change more so than any other state. And we know that it's real.</p> <p>\"I'm not one to attribute every man \u2014 activity of man to the changes in the climate. There is something to be said also for man's activities, but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet.\"</p> <p>I'm pretty sure that that last statement is a garbled attempt to reiterate what she said in the Newsmax interview, but you be the judge. Unlike the previous quote, this one at least has a nod in the direction of acknowledging (tentatively) the possibility of a human influence. What's important is what comes next:</p> <p>\"But there are real changes going on in our climate. And I don't want to argue about the causes. What I want to argue about is, how are we going to get there to positively affect the impacts?\"</p> <p>Dare we say that it, in fact, very much makes a difference what is causing global warming? If CO2 really weren't a major part of the cause, what in the world would be the point of John McCain's (or anybody's) stated policy of acting to reduce emissions? And even if you were of the school that says adaptation is better than mitigation, knowing the cause is an important part of knowing what kind of climate change you have to adapt to, how long it is likely to last, and how much worse it is likely to get in the future.</p> <p>Biden's answer, by comparison, was direct, straightforward, and simple:</p> <p>\"BIDEN: Well, I think it is manmade. I think it's clearly manmade. And, look, this probably explains the biggest fundamental difference between John McCain and Barack Obama and Sarah Palin and Joe Biden \u2014 Governor Palin and Joe Biden.</p> <p>If you don't understand what the cause is, it's virtually impossible to come up with a solution. We know what the cause is. The cause is manmade. That's the cause. That's why the polar icecap is melting.\"</p> <p>Well, maybe he left out the kind of caveats and qualifications you'd attach to the attribution of the recent loss of (North) polar sea ice if this were an AGU talk instead of a vice-presidential debate. Overall,though, the statement gets to the heart of the matter.</p> <p>One can moreover doubt even Palin's commitment to dealing with the consequences of climate change. Surely, that would include doing something to save the polar bears,yet the State of Alaska (against the advice of its own wildlife biologists) is suing the Interior department over its decision to list the polar bear as \"threatened\" \u2014 and this despite the fact that the Bush administration put so many qualifications on the listing as to make it essentially toothless. What's even more telling is that the brief submitted to Interior drew heavily on a list of climate skeptics (including the Marshall Institute's Willie Soon) that could easily have been culled from the infamous Inhofe 400. (See this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/01/sarahpalin.climatechange\">theguardian.com/environment article</a>). Palin's role in bringing this case has not been peripheral; she has been very much at the center of the effort, and has consistently questioned the causal link between CO2 and global warming in making the case. As early as December 2006, she wrote to Secretary Kempthorne: \"\"When a species' habitat (in this case, sea ice) is declining due to climate change, but there are no discrete human activities that can be regulated or modified to effect change, what do you do?\" Further information about Palin's long fight against the listing, and her view of the scientific issues involved, can be found <a href=\"http://www.cnsnews.com/public/Content/article.aspx?RsrcID=34907\">here</a>.</p> <p>We will take this occasion to note also that Biden used the debate to reaffirm Obama's long standing position in favor of \"clean coal.\" Whether this is a good or bad thing depends on the extent to which the candidates understand what should really be meant by this term. From the point of view of global warming, the only \"clean\" coal would be coal burned with 100% carbon capture and sequestration \u2014 certainly worthy of research and pilot implementation, but not by any means a technology that can be counted on at present to solve the problem. (And of course, the term \"clean\" is even then relative, since what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountaintop_removal_mining\">mountain top removal mining</a> does to the West Virginia hills and rivers is anything but \"clean\").</p> <p>So there you are.

  "<p>With a month to go before election day, the McCain campaign took a sharp turn towards the negative over the weekend - and Sarah Palin was in the vanguard. </p> <p>At three different events in California on Saturday, Palin attacked Obama's associations with Bill Ayers, the former Weather Underground member, accusing the Democratic candidate of \"palling around with terrorists\".</p> <p>The attacks drew a sharp response from Obama, who made much of a remark by a McCain adviser, published in the Washington Post, that his campaign was \"looking forward to turning the page on this financial crisis\". </p> <p>\"They plan to - and I quote - 'turn the page' on the discussion about our economy and spend the final weeks of this campaign launching Swift Boat-style attacks on me,\" Obama told a crowd in North Carolina, in a speech backed up by a new TV ad. \"We are facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and John McCain wants us to 'turn the page' on talking about the economy?\"</p> <p>Democratic surrogates also said the Obama campaign had given them the go-ahead to start mentioning some of McCain's questionable associations, including his involvement in the Keating Five scandal and his connections to the ultraconservative Council for World Freedom.</p> <p>The new negativity from the McCain campaign is a response to continuing bad news for the Republicans in the opinion polls: a New York Times analysis at the weekend noted that Obama is now seriously competitive in nine states that voted for Bush in 2004, while McCain is competitive in only four that voted for Kerry.</p> <p>Obama's associations with Ayers hardly justify the phrase \"palling around\": they served on a charity board together, and Ayers once hosted a political event for Obama early in his career. And Obama has repudiated Ayers's 1960s radicalism. But the question that seems likely to be most pressing in the coming week is not whether the Palin-led attacks are fair: it's whether they will work.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama has no public events scheduled for today. Joe Biden has cancelled his appearances for Monday and Tuesday after the death of his mother-in-law on Sunday. McCain is campaigning in New Mexico and Tennessee; Palin is in Florida. </p> <p>Tomorrow night, Obama and McCain will return to the limelight, nudging Palin aside, as they appear for the second presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee, in a \"town hall meeting\", taking questions from the audience. It's McCain's favourite format.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Gallup's latest daily tracking poll, released yesterday, gave Obama a seven-point lead, at 50%, over McCain's 43%. It was the ninth straight day that the Democrat had had a statistically significant lead. An amusing Rasmussen poll, meanwhile, exposes the depth of the country's annoyance with its Congressmen and women in the wake of the bail-out law passed on Friday: fully 59% of voters, the poll found, would eject the entire Congress if they could.</p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"Our opponent ... is someone who sees America, it seems, as being so imperfect, imperfect enough, that he is palling around with terrorists who would target their own country ... This is not a man who sees America as you see America and as I see America\": Sarah Palin all but calls Obama a foreigner and a traitor - and not, one suspects, for the last time.</p> <h2>Spoof of the day</h2> <p>Tina Fey excels again on <a href=\" http://www.nbc.com/Saturday\\_Night\\_Live/video/clips/vp-debate-open-palin-biden/727421/\">Saturday Night Live</a>, in a spoof of last Thursday's debate.

Read this morning's New York Times, Obama! Obama! How about Bill Ayers, Obama!\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There have been several newspaper articles investigating Obama's relationship with Ayers. They have <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/05/fact-check-is-obama-palling-around-with-terrorists/\">professional connections but aren't close</a>, as the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/04/us/politics/04ayers.html?pagewanted=1&amp;sq=ayers&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1\">New York Times article finds</a>.</p> <p>The conservative blogosphere in the US has been much more aggressive than the McCain campaign itself in pushing Obama's connection to 60s radical William Ayers. Just do a search on <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;hs=Wx0&amp;q=New+York+Times+White+wash+Obama&amp;btnG=Search\">New York Times Obama whitewash</a>, and you'll see that conservative bloggers don't believe the media's fact checking. But this like other allegations and rumours continue to rumble around the internet. How do these messages spread? </p> <p>Barack Obama's presidential campaign has faced scrutiny over more than his connection to Bill Ayers. He has also had to rebut online rumours that he secretly is a Muslim, some sort of <a href=\"http://wwwwakeupamericans-spree.blogspot.com/2008/07/manchurian-candidate-muslim-takeover-of.html\">Islamic Manchurian candidate</a>. Some have even claimed that <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/09/28/obama-antichrist-nc/\">he is the anti-Christ</a>, although how one would go about proving or disproving that is beyond me. <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/antichrist.asp\">Internet rumour-debunking site Snopes</a> tries.</p> <p>Of course, Democrats aren't the only ones who face rumours. Sarah Palin herself was forced to reveal that her daughter <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/01/politics/politico/thecrypt/main4405099.shtml\">Bristol Palin was pregnant after rumours</a> circulated online that the vice presidential nominee wasn't the mother of her fifth child.</p> <p>Usually the source of a <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/227/story/36410.html\">rumour is difficult to track down</a>, and it's <a href=\"http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=9137C354-3048-5C12-000A32656C8CAEA4\">devilishly difficult to rebut them</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/\">Jon Kleinberg at Cornell University</a> is studying <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/105/12/4633.full\">the phenomenon</a>, and he found that instead of spreading virally, like a biological contagion, political rumours often spread quite slowly and take reinforcement. People often wait to hear a message twice before passing it on to a couple of people.</p> <p>It's not just people forwarding e-mails. Studies have been done looking at the logs of Google searches, and earlier this year, the top two searches for Barack Obama were looking for his biography, but the fifth or sixth most popular search term was \"Obama Christian or Muslim\".</p> <p>\"People were using the internet to figure this out for once and for all,\" Kleinberg said.</p> <p>And these messages are hard to kill off. One of the most popular chain e-mails dates back to a 1995 message saying that the US government was looking to end funding for National Public Radio, the public radio broadcaster in the US. Another perennial favourite is a 1997 e-mail saying that the US government was looking to institute a five cent tax on every e-mail.</p> <p>More than a decade later, these chain e-mails are still rumbling around the internet. I doubt these political rumours will die in the next 30 days before Americans cast their ballots on 4 November.</p>",
  "<p>So where are we in the Great London Police Drama? Much debate has raged over whether Mayor Johnson's effective ousting of Ian Blair last Thursday was driven by political ideology or a need for more productive policing, or was even an <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/tim-newburn-boris-has-some-explaining-to-do-951669.html\">unintended consequence</a>. Friday's Guardian <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/oct/03/blair.conservatives\">broke the story</a> \u2013 repeated everywhere else all weekend \u2013 that the outgoing Commissioner was told at the fateful meeting, also attended by Kit Malthouse and MPA chief executive Catherine Crawford, that there would be no rush to replace him because a Tory government was on its way and would deliver a top cop to a Tory mayor's taste. </p> <p>This suggestion has been sharply denied both on the record and into my right ear as I trudged sleeplessly past <a href=\"http://davehill.typepad.com/claptonian/\">Clapton Pond</a> clutching a loaf of bad-for-you bread early on Friday morning. The Guardian, though, sticks by its sources. If only I could tell you everything I've been told about each version of events, well, you still might not know which to believe. I'm trying figure out if there's a way both can be true. It's tough work, I'm telling you. </p> <p>Attention has since turned to Blair's successor and the manner in which he will be chosen. The formal power to hire and fire remains with the Home Secretary, but Johnson's intervention shows that in the right circumstances his informal power can be decisive. He's now working hard to manage the fallout from this. Strong reactions from West Yorkshire Chief Constable Sir <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23563627-details/Met+job+%27possible%27+criticises+Mayor/article.do\">Norman Bettinson</a>, ACPO President <a href=\"http://www.acpo.police.uk/pressrelease.asp?PR_GUID={D1F0D5D0-EBDF-4880-8D88-898E002FC559}\">Ken Jones</a> (thanks, <a href=\"http://torytroll.blogspot.com/2008/10/top-cops-fight-back-as-boris-fixes.html\">Troll</a>) and Blair's predecessor <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/ianblair/3140000/Sir-Ian-Blair-resignation-Lord-Stevens-says-Metropolitan-Police-must-never-be-politicised.html\">Sir John Stevens</a> have demonstrated the resistance among senior policeman to closer control by politicians. </p> <p>I'm told that Johnson's initial low profile and refusal to answer questions about Blair was motivated by a desire to let him leave with dignity. Whatever, the mayor broke cover on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00dx462/\">The Politics Show</a> yesterday, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7653520.stm\">dismissing</a> the \"political\" charge as \"poppycock, balderdash and tripe\" \u2013 wouldn't a simple \"bollocks\" have sufficed? \u2013 and denying that a constitutional precedent had been set. Yet it is difficult to see how Johnson's opinions about candidates for next leader of the Met won't carry more weight now than they would have this time last week. </p> <p>Who does the mayor have his eye on? Looks like <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/ianblair/3131098/Sir-Ian-Blair-resignation-American-police-chief-Bill-Bratton-denies-link-to-top-job.html\">a line can be drawn</a> under speculation that Bill Bratton, the man who implemented Rudi Giuliani's alleged \"miracle\" in New York \u2013 and, inconveniently for \"zero tolerance\" evangelists, an <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2007/11/21/do2108.xml\">admirer of Blair</a> - is in the frame. Should we read anything into Kit Malthouse's speaking of the next permanent appointment being a \"he or <strong>she</strong>?\" </p> <p>Search me. But as he prepares to chair the <a href=\"http://www.mpa.gov.uk/news/press/2008/08-051.htm\">MPA</a> for the first time this morning, Johnson is surely aware that he needs to tread very carefully. Populist button-pushing about removing \"political correctness\" from policing such as he indulged in (albeit in moderation) during the election campaign will not endear him to ethnic minority officers <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/oct/05/police\">unappeased</a> by Blair departure and I'm encouraged that, just prior to publishing this post, I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/06/police.race\">read</a> and hear on the Today programme that Johnson is set to launch an inquiry into racism in the Met. He'll need to be very mindful too that stop-and-search a la Blunt 2 remains a potential danger to building the trust with the public that successful policing depends on far more than tech tools like knife arches or crime maps.</p> <p>For the good of the Met and London as a whole, Johnson needs to still public and police disquiet alike. I'm assured that a return of the damaging, self-defeating, macho \"canteen culture\" street policing of yore is not considered desirable. The mayor would be wise to spread that message around.</p>"
