However, exit polls later in the day saw voters under 30, the target demographic of the Obama camp, voting at about the same levels as in 2004.</p> <p>That would be a disappointment for the Obama camp, which had been hoping that young voters would buck the tradition of showing enthusiasm for a candidate and then failing to turn out on the day. Exit polls did chart a rise in African-American turnout.</p> <p>The stock market experienced its biggest election day rally in 24 years on expectation of an Obama victory.</p> <p>Independent election monitors reported sporadic instances of delayed openings of polling stations, broken voting machines, ballot shortages, voter confusion and occasional abuse in a number of battleground states including Florida, Ohio, Colorado, Pennsylvania and Virginia.</p> <p>The McCain camp raised its own charges of irregularities, accusing Black Panther activists holding nightsticks and standing outside Philadelphia polling stations, in an attempt to intimidate white voters.</p> <p>McCain also accused out-of-state Obama volunteers of casting votes in Florida, and of voters casting multiple ballots in Florida.</p> <p>Reflecting the intensity of the campaign, Obama and McCain put in a final burst of campaigning after casting their own votes. </p> <p>Obama made a final dash from his home in Chicago to neighbouring Indiana, which was Republican in 2004. Reporters travelling with him reported that the candidate was in a subdued rather than celebratory mood, perhaps reflecting the news of the death of his grandmother yesterday. </p> <p>Obama told them that whatever happened, the campaign, the costliest in US history at over $1 billion (\u00a3630m) as well as the longest, had been \"extraordinary\".</p> <p>At Obama headquarters in Chicago, a campaign worker described the mood as \"optimistically nauseous\", reflecting both the party's hopes but the lingering fear after Democratic defeats to Bush in 2000 and 2004.</p> <p>McCain, who at 72 would be the oldest ever US president, made late dashes to New Mexico and Colorado, both of which were also Republican in 2004, before returning to his native Arizona to vote. </p> <p>The Republican said he remained in contention - and was hoping for a surprise win. But there was an elegiac quality to his insistence. \"Look, I know I'm still the underdog, I understand that,\" he said. </p> <p>\"You can't imagine the excitement of an individual to be this close to the most important position in the world, and I'll enjoy it. I'll never forget it as long as I live.\"</p> <p>The excitement generated by the campaign translated into high voter turnout, with election officials reporting extraordinary levels of interest - to the extent that authorities in Colorado warned they might not be able to finish the count until tomorrow. <br> The next president will inherit horrendous economic problems that will limit the scope of his ambitions. </p> <p>Obama, in his final rallies, was already tempering his early promise of change with warnings about how he would have to curb some of his more ambitious plans, trying to lower expectations that he would be able to move quickly on health care and education reform.</p>",
  "<p>The first national exit polls are coming in from the Associated Press, and they confirm what we already knew. For the voters, it's the economy, stupid, and there is virtual unanimity that the US economy is in a very bad place.</p> <p>The early figures say the economy was the number one issue for 62% of voters. A year ago, Iraq was the big issue, but today only one in ten voters think it is their most pressing concern. After that comes terrorism, healthcare and energy. A contrarian 6% of the population say the economy is in excellent shape. They may just be trying to wind up the pollsters, or it might be a personal remark, that they are doing fine thank you very much. More than 90%, however, have a more sober assessment, saying the economy is in poor shape.</p> <p>This can only be good news for Barack Obama. The financial collapse was the turning point that put him solidly ahead in the polls. The economy is a winning issue for him. Interestingly, substantial majorities believe both Obama and McCain will raise their taxes. That suggests that a key distinction John McCain attempted to make has not registered with most voters.</p>",

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>6pm:</strong> At 7pm ET, all eyes will be on the news channels as the results start to come in, the pundits sing for their supper and the graphics machines go into such overdrive that small puffs of graphic smoke start puffing out the top.</p> <p>I'll be here, flicking through the channels, trying to decide who's got the sharpest coverage, the flashiest maps, the choicest quotes, the biggest hair and, most importantly, who's going to claim to call the whole election first. </p> <p>If you're watching the coverage on TV, listening on the radio or following on the internet, join me to cover the coverage and democratise the punditry with any choice observances you happen to witness as, try as I might, I can't watch twelve channels at once. (Sadly)</p> <p>Back at 7pm, Midnight or 4pm (depending on where you are). Whatever: in an hour, anyway.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>7:07pm:</strong> The sense of urgency is palpable. And, finally, meaningful. </p> <p>The polls are closing, the pundits are gearing up to actually say real things about real facts. Yes, \"Get READY\" says CNN \"We are about to make a A PROJECTION\" which isn't the most exciting turn of phrase anyone's ever heard.</p> <p>Still, at least from here on in we'll be seeing projections based on real live news. Up to this point they're been sitting around a table, banks of them, five along one desk on CNN, with no less than eight laptops in front of them making urgent pronouncements on what we might just be going to see once those polls have closed (just like they have been for the last six months or more)</p> <p>But now they're closed. In Indiana the projection is that Obama should win. And based on the 4% of numbers that have come back in that state so far, he's lagging behind 49% to McCain's 51%.</p> <p>More importantly, the technology of CNN is lagging behind practically everyone else. Seven foot 2d screens? Really, who cares. If it isn't 3d, no one's impressed anymore, are they?</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>7:15pm:</strong> Fox News is making a projection that McCain will win Kentucky. Please try to hide your surprise. Their desk has only four pundits, and no laptops at all, though, so what do they know? </p> <p>One of those pundits, however, is a pretty Palin-a-like, complete with bright red jacket; which may be showing some kind of sisterhood and support, but frankly sitting by the muted suits of the other frowning pundits, it's eye-bleedingly bright.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>7:24pm:</strong> \"Jessica, You were a terrific hologram, thanks very much\". Seriously, I take back what I ever said about CNN's coverage. The seven-foot screens were only the beginning. </p> <p>Jessica, you see, was in Chicago, and appeared not by satellite, But By Hologram right there in the middle of the CNN Election Centre. Perhaps a little smaller than she might be in real life, but just as 3D, she talked directly about what was going on there (nothing, but that's not the point, she was a sodding hologram) and how the technology worked (magic) and then she suddenly leant forward and whispered urgently: <em>Help me CNN Election Centre, you're my only hope</em> reached out, and the picture flickered to nothing.</p> <p>I have no idea what it all means, but it's great to see the advances of technology aren't being wasted.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>7:33pm:</strong> According to my local news - as if any of you care - Frank my friendly local anchor is ruling over a lot of really over-excitable local reporters jabbering faster than they ever have in their life. </p> <p>Key points of the election coverage in San Francisco so far, then, include trying to top the queue length of the last correspondent (lines here have been more than TWENTY FIVE minutes long!), saying 'ahhhhhh?' a lot between sentences, and staring into the camera like a startled rabbit.</p> <p>However, I will be keeping an eye on it, if you don't mind, because the possible passing of Proposition 8 - which will ban gay marriage only six months after it became legal; a big talking point here.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>7:43pm:</strong> Back on CNN, one of my IM correspondents (I promise you, I have more laptop screens open than CNN here) Mark C, has observed that Brit Hume looks like a man who hasn't got around to taking off his halloween costume yet - and went to the party dressed as the undead. </p> <p>Meanwhile, we've just had a brilliant snafu on Fox - David Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager, appeared live via satellite to talk to the immaculately coiffured semi-plasticated Shepherd Smith. </p> <p>\"So David, you've been very busy, and your second child was due yesterday. Any news yet David?\" Said Shepherd<br>\"Well, Charlie, it's too early to be exuberant yet, so I'm cautious\" Said David.</p> <p>What? Well, I mean, childbirth is always a nervous time, but come on, it's your second child! What?</p> <p>After only a couple more questions, it became clear that while Shepherd was talking to David, David was talking to Charlie on ABC and had no idea that Shepherd and Fox had got the feed all wrong. The possibility of people answering questions entirely inappropriately was tantalising, but never quite lived up to the promise, damnit.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>7:50pm:</strong> My sister is reporting a man with a magnificent rug on the BBC coverage, can anyone confirm?</p> <p>On CNBC, a table of four pundits (two laptops) keeps splitting into a siz-way shouting match. The fact that some of them are actually sitting next to each other in real life means that they're looking left and right when they shout and, when in splitscreen mode, look like the Brady Bunch. It's brilliant. Quite makes up for the fact that they're shouting \"I think it's WRANG to be a deficit hawk!\" which out of context makes absolutely no sense at all (and doesn't sound like anything the Brady Bunch would say).</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>8:02pm:</strong> With the news from Asta in the comments that NBC is not only making great use of the Rockerfeller Centre Ice Rink for their red/blue map, but also is talking to Ann Curry (\"The same Ann Curry who was once voted America's dumbest TV journalist.\" says Asta) I immediately turn to MSNBC to find stirring horns and many many stars and stripes fluttering in front of the Rockerfeller centre. </p> <p>Nothing interesting happens there, though. Lots of graphics reading 'TOO EARLY TO CALL!' - they're all being very cautious, on every channel, in fact - and really don't want to say anything until they're sure. And probably a very good plan. Does make for slightly less pleasing viewing, though, if we know we're going to have to wait all the way down to the wire to know for sure. <br>I mean, come <em>on</em>; I'm missing a rerun of Gilmore Girls for this.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>8:10pm:</strong> Incidentally, as the second wave of polls close - I should have mentioned earlier: if you're looking for numbers, stats and hard news on the results as they come in, this blog is totally not the one where you'll find those things. You'll be wanting <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/nov/04/uselections2008-barackobama6\">Oliver's brilliant blog over yonder</a>. We're purely about touchscreens, satellite links, bad toupees and magic holograms over here. And pizza. Hopefully.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>8:21pm:</strong> On CNN, we're cutting by satellite to the places where one loser and one winner will later speak.</p> <p>At Camp Obama, Suzanne Malveaux is shouting into a microphone that they've basically had to stick right inside her mouth to be heard. The last two times they cut to her, they couldn't hear a single word. This time we can hear, at least, the kind of words you can always hear when people have those rock-star microphones, you can hear someone shouting '<em>FUZZ YOFFLE JZUJZ AN OBAMA SCHZH!</em>\" like they're trying to land a fighter plane. The people in Grant Park behind her are yelling and excited. Very VERY excited.</p> <p>Dana Bash is in a ballroom in Phoenix, where a the Phoenix Boy's choir is singing a quiet, mournful number while people stand around and sip wine in a totally plumberesque, unelitist fashion. What's the mood there, she's asked by Wolf Blitzer? Oh, quiet, she says. Realistic. Stoic. </p> <p>Stoic. Interesting word.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>8:42pm:</strong> On Fox, the state is called by a graphic of the faces of McCain and Obama flipping on individual cards like that Victorian optical illusion with a bird on one side and a cage on the other where a spinning thread puts the bird inside the cage. There is therefore a lot more that could be done with this graphic. McCain on one side of the spinning graphic, a beautiful bouncing baby on the other: spin the graphic, McCain kisses the baby. Obama on one side of the spinning card, Bill Ayers on the other, spin the card, 'Bama cavorts with terrorists! Come ON, Fox, you just weren't working hard enough with those now, were you.</p> <p>Meanwhile, they're showing the massive swell of supporters who have turned up to Grant Park in hope of seeing a new president speak later on. \"That's a great turn out\" the anchor and correspondent agree. \"Barack Obama; lucky with the weather. AGAIN.\"</p> <p>Yes. That's why those people are there. It's not raining.</p> <p>Anyone curious about the BBC toupee question, meanwhile, can enter the debate on a more informed level by looking at the screengrab someone's helpfully uploaded for me <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrbiggs/3003525421/\">here</a>. I say it IS. What do you say?</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>9:18pm:</strong> If I'm informed one more time on one more channel that 270 is a magic number, I may take 270 pencils, and stick one up a single nostril on 270 news anchors. </p> <p>At the moment, as the polls close but remain too close to call and the map fills up with 'Dunno Yet Yellow', the battle of the touchscreen against the CGI is on. On CNN, voter analysis with crazy hands on a touch-sensitive whiteboard reveals things that people either knew already or can't analyse - apparently 52% of people said that race was a motivating factor and, in a seperate question, 53% race made no difference to their vote at all. </p> <p>MSNBC, meanwhile, presents the staes so far from entirely within a virtual sentate. Virtual columns and a virtual whiteboard (that's almost exactly the same size and shape as CNN's REAL whiteboard, but weirdly higher-tech because it's completely non-physical) surround the man who stands by a real podium - one real laptop in front of him - pointing at the whiteboard behind him that isn't there.</p> <p>And yet none of them is saying anything wildly different. And most of them, with great anticipation and breathless portent, are barely saying anything at all.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>9:35pm:</strong> Katie Couric - and I can't believe we've neglected her so far, apologies to all her fans - is being more strident on CBS than anyone I've so far seen. \"Obama's on 190 votes, on his way to 270\" (270? Really? Is that an important number, then?) \"and the presidency; John McCain's running out of ways to win. This is election night in USA\" she says, sounding a little bit like she's called it already.</p> <p>She also has great hair.</p> <p>ABC's on the streets of New York, amid the crowds in Times square, shouting happy shouts to keep themselves warm. At least I <em>think</em> that's why they're doing it, unless they've secretly been listening to Katie Couric.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>9:48pm:</strong> You know what's an important number, as well as 270? 3. Three is, as De La Soul once said, a magic number. Because the channels don't want to call things until they feel completely sure ... but then most of them seem to feel sure enough to call it once 3% of precincts in any particular state have declared.</p> <p>On ABC, they're going further than Times Square. Correspondent for the Continent of Africa (I think that's her official title) Dana is in Kenya, in Kogelo, in fact, the ancestral home of the Obama family. </p> <p>We're told, before we speak to her, that the world's press have descended on this tiny, rural community, and we can see the towns people gathered behind Dana on plastic chairs wearing colourful baseball caps, faces lit by something just off screen.</p> <p>Before we cut to Dana (by live satellite link), the studio has a question: \"Just how accurate are the results they're getting there? Are they getting results at all yet? Are they at all up to date?\"</p> <p>And how are they getting those? Is it by smoke signal? Or by carrier pigeon? Or perhaps - call me crazy - by Live Satellite Link?</p> <p>Sadly Dana cannot hear us, ABC's feed keeps cutting out.</p> <p>\"In this tiny village, where there are usually only less than 500 people, there is actually a LARGE SCREEN where they are actually watching INTERNATIONAL TELEVISION and the results are actually coming in, as quickly as they are over there, and they're actually CHEERING as the results come in from each state!\"</p> <p>Are they? Actually? In AFRICA? Madness!<br>Well, they can't be watching it on ABC, then, their feed is shonky. They're probably tuned to the CNN - or someone else with the 3% rule.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>9:56pm:</strong> \"We're going to take a break, while we eat cookies, and then we'll be right back\"</p> <p>CNN may have holograms, ABC definitely has a Correspondent for the Continent of Africa: Fox has biscuits someone's brought in, decorated to look like a high-def widescreen TV tuned immovably to Fox News.</p> <p>I can't help but wonder if, as I flick through the channels, I'm always <em>just</em> missing the really awesome technological advances in television graphics.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>10.05pm:</strong> Ok, it's 10pm on the East Coast, Silly AM in the UK and almost Pizza O'Clock at my house, and on twitter I'm seeing lots of people calling it already. Iowa for Obama, they say, and with California and other big blue states yet to be called, the internet is starting to buzz with early calls.</p> <p>\"Every time they call it for Barack, we take a shot\" says <a href=\"http://twitter.com/TinaFey/status/990699933\">Tina Fey on Twitter</a>. I like the woman's style, but I hope someone else is driving her home, because she's going to be HAMMERED in a minute.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>10:39pm:</strong> It's remarkable when you flick over and see the local channels who don't have the big network billions to throw at fancy graphics. It feels like you're travelling back in time, like suddenly they'll cut to the weather and someone will start placing large magnetic clouds on gaudy-coloured maps. These flat 2D images of a giant USA, states coloured a stark RED or a BLUE with no sense of sensitive aesthetic judgement involved. </p> <p>Hell, on ABC the maps may be flat but they're shaded, county by county throughout the state, redder where the vote is stronger, fading to a gentle pastel pink blush where the Rebulicans won but only barely. It's a mottled, marbled view of the major election on a macro scale, and as the analysts take their magic pens and scrawl illustrative circles and arrows and marks on the screen, it somewhat feels like someone's taking a felt tip to a Georges Seurat painting.</p> <p>Well, kinda.</p> <p>Anyway, as they're moving through, rushing from delicately shaded red state to delicately blushing blue one, it means very little at all - would be great if you could stop and look in depth, but there is not time, for depth, just impressive graphics, my friends. So it basically, at this speed, means feck-all.</p> <p>Looks purdy, though.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>10:49pm:</strong> I'd be doing some more channel-flicking if I hadn't got rather stuck staring at Katie Couric. She really is remarkable. Looking, I mean. There's just something ethereal about her. And I'm trying to decide what that is, so I'm having to watch correspondent after correspondent in split screen interviews until I can see someone next to her in real life to decide.</p> <p>Because if she's always in soft focus, that's one thing, and all very well. So then whoever sat next to her would also be in soft focus, and we would know.</p> <p>But it's almost more than that. It's almost as if she looks like she's <strong>always</strong> in soft focus. So if you met her in person, you'd just be overwhelmed by the fact her features are all slightly blurred. <br>Perhaps she has a soft downy fur covering her that diffuses the light from the cameras?<br>Or perhaps, like a beautiful pumpkin lantern, she has some kind of softly flickering internal light source?<br>Or maybe she releases a fine mist of steam into the air around her, to create a more flattering focus for her face at any angle they might catch?</p> <p>Whatever it is, it's remarkable. Please, let's drink to Katie Couric.</p> <p>Or, perhaps, to Obama. Who, from the returns starting to dribble in ever faster, seems to be pulling off a pretty crushing win. The people in Grant Park in Chicago seem to be feeling it, though. A million of them, standing and waiting. A million? Really? Wow.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>10:56pm:</strong> The internet is buzzing with the rumour that all the networks will call it officially at 11pm ET. That's four minutes from now.</p> <p>I'm excitedly waiting, and desperately trying to decide quickly which channel to watch it on. They're all much of a muchness, but Fox may be sweetest, I suppose...</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>11:02pm:</strong> AND THEY'VE CALLED IT. </p> <p>Every single network, has it on big screens BARACK OBAMA ELECTED PRESIDENT.</p> <p>CNN with shots of a cheering Grant Park, Fox with glasses tipped to the end of the nose and a mournful face. MSNBC has college students cheering and children jumping up and down in Times Square, on ANC the noise is deafening.</p> <p>This is, frankly, a very exciting thing to watch.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>11:13pm:</strong> \"There's always celebration on one side or the other\" says ABC, with great analytical flair \"but I've never seen anything like this\"</p> <p>On CNN, they're quoting from Martin Luth King Jr and from the constitution.</p> <p>On Fox they're talking about Bill Ayers ... but then moving on to say what a promising figure Obama is and how they've thought so all along.</p> <p>MSNBC are doing a marathon voiceover over crowds of cheering people in Grant Park (\"<em> ... And the remarkable thing about the fact that the analysis will prove that the crowds came out in numbers like were never before imagined when they thought about what kind of numbers might possibly be imaginable at such a time and in such an occasion when ...</em>\" Oh, God Bless rolling news)</p> <p>And on the comedy network Stephen Colbert has a parrot on his shoulder.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>11:24pm:</strong> The camera has been lingering on The Reverend Jesse Jackson having a cry in the crowd at grant park for around four minutes now.</p> <p>In fact, the only thing that could possibly make them cut away, makes them cut: </p> <p><strong>A concession speech by John McCain.</strong></p> <p>\"A few minutes ago, I had the honour of calling Senator Obama ...\"</p> <p><em>BOOOOO, BOOOOOO!</em> says the crowd, quietened only slightly by the soft padding hands of John McCain.</p> <p>\"... and congratulating him\"</p> <p><em>Booooo! BOOOOO!</em><br>Pad pad. </p> <p>He talks about Booker T Washington and the importance of bridging differences, moving on, and supporting the new president whoever they may have supported up till now.</p> <p>\"We have failed. And those we fell short, the failure was mine, not yours\" he says, voice cracking. Before thanking Cindy, the children, and his mother. HIS MOTHER? Seriously?</p> <p>He thanks Sarah Palin, and the crowd goes absolutely wild. Palin 2012 it is, then? She stands next to him, and cries a little. She's going to speak too, right?</p> <p>\"Thank you, and God Bless you and God Bless America\" he ends a gracious and diplomatic and delicate concession speech before leaving and hugging a lady we can only assume to be his mother (as she is about 238)</p> <p><strong><em>U! S! A! U! S! A!</em></strong> Chants the crowd, as crowds will on these kinds of occasions. Will Sarah speak now? I hope she will. I'll miss her so very, very much.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>11:46pm:</strong> Anderson Cooper, whose name sounds like a firm of accountants, and Wolf Blitzer, whose name sounds like a helicopter hunting trip holiday company from Alaska, are filling time before the President Elect - and that would be Mr Barack Obama (who sounds like a piece of designer wooden furniture) - comes on stage and makes his victory speech. <br>There's very little rolling news can add to this moment now. <br>It's momentous without any help.</p> <p>And so that's where I should leave you, and point you over to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/nov/05/uselections2008-barackobama\">Oliver's main liveblog</a>, as unless the graphics start exploding or the hologram comes back (I'm not sure they can afford for the hologram to come back, otherwise they'd all have just done it via hologram all evening, it was that cool) there's not much more I can say.</p> <p><strong>Thank you, and good night.</strong></p> <p><em>Thanks for reading, and for your comments.

  "<p>Doesn't it seem odd that it'll soon be over -- this insane, historic, aggravating, stirring, inspiring, profoundly moving and ridiculous thing that's been a part of our lives for so many months? But the final rallies have taken place, and in a few hours, barring the completely unforeseen, it really will end, amid guaranteed scenes of intense emotion. More than enough has already been written and said about the momentous nature of the choice America faces in this election, and the decision that all the polls suggest it's going to make, so I won't add to that for now. I'll just say this: I'll be liveblogging right here in a short while (at <strong>6pm eastern, 11pm UK time</strong>), bringing you all the presidential results and highlights of the congressional elections as they happen, along with reports from our team in Chicago, Phoenix and elsewhere, and I hope you'll join me.</p> <p><strong>The basics</strong></p> <p>Daniel Nasaw's most excellent guide to the evening is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/04/us-president-election-guide\">here</a>, and I added some thoughts about when and how we can expect the various states to be called tonight <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/nov/04/uselections2008-barackobama5\">here</a>. Oh -- and I just remembered that CNN will be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/oct/30/uselections2008\">interviewing holograms</a>; on any other evening this would surely be the most exciting thing imaginable.</p> <p><strong>Paths to victory</strong></p> <p>The simplest way to look at where we stand tonight is probably this: Barack Obama should win all the states John Kerry won in 2004, despite John McCain's efforts to grab Pennsylvania and (a longer shot) New Hampshire. If he does win the Kerry states, he needs only Florida or Ohio and he's won 270 electoral votes. But before we hear results from those states, we'll almost certainly hear from Virginia: if Obama wins there, he doesn't need Florida or Ohio so long as he gets one of the other battlegrounds -- Colorado, Indiana, Missouri, Iowa, New Mexico, Nevada or North Carolina. (We won't know for sure that he's won, of course, until the Kerry states come in for the Democrats, so the networks will definitely wait for Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, and maybe the others -- not that McCain is going to win California in any remotely credible universe.) If Obama wins none of Florida, Ohio and Virginia, he can certainly still win, but he'll need a combination of those other battlegrounds as well. </p> <p><strong>When will we know?</strong></p> <p>The big problem in constructing any kind of timetable for the night is that we don't know the gap between the closing of polls in a given state, and the calling by the networks: a state closing first doesn't mean it'll be called first, and Florida, especially, will probably keep us waiting. But here's a rough idea of the first half of the evening. At <strong>6pm/11pm</strong>, polls begin to close in <strong>Kentucky and Indiana</strong> (though not in the whole state till <strong>7pm/midnight</strong>); then at 7pm/midnight polls close in <strong>Virginia, Georgia</strong>, and most of <strong>Florida</strong> and <strong>New Hampshire</strong>. Kentucky's a shoo-in for McCain, but Obama is only trailing slightly now in Indiana and Georgia. If either state isn't quickly called for McCain, he's in for a very bad night; should Obama win Indiana, he's in for a landslide. (Results from the west of the state, which is Obama territory near Chicago, will arrive later than in the Republican east.) If Obama wins Virginia alone among all these early states, McCain is going to need to do very well among the tossups, or seize Pennsylvania. </p> <p>At <strong>7.30pm/12.30am</strong> polls close in <strong>Ohio</strong> and <strong>North Carolina</strong>. An Ohio win effectively hands Obama the election, though you'd want to wait for <strong>Pennsyvlania</strong> to be sure; polls close there at <strong>8pm</strong> as they do in 17 other states plus Washington DC, including the swing state of <strong>Missouri</strong>. </p> <p>Got all that? If McCain doesn't win Pennsylvania, and the polls suggest he won't, he'd have to win every single tossup state in order to squeak to victory. So it's perfectly likely this will all be over by about <strong>9pm/2am</strong>. But some people probably said something similar in 2000...<br> <strong>House, Senate, governors</strong></p> <p>I'll bring you highlights of these, at least until we know the identity of the president. Democrats, who lead in the Senate 51-49 (relying on Joe the Lieberman), might get 60 seats -- a filibuster-proof majority, making a Democratic president's work much easier -- for the first time in a generation. They control the House 235-199; if they make gains of 20 or more, we can call that a landslide. Eleven governorships are up for grabs, but it's only North Carolina and Washington where things are close. Democrats currently hold them both.</p> <p><strong>Join in</strong> </p> <p>I want to know where you are, how you're marking tonight, what you're eating and drinking, how you're feeling, what your gut's telling you -- all that stuff. And you might as well tell me, in the comments, because I'm certainly going to be telling you. (I also have fantasies that somebody's following this blog from Vanuatu, or Antarctica, or Pitcairn, so can you please pretend that you are even if you're not?) In an emotional return to the beer consumed during the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/sep/27/uselections2008.barackobama\">first presidential debate liveblog</a>, all those weeks ago, my choice tonight is <a href=\"http://www.sierranevada.com/\">Sierra Nevada</a>. History, plus beer, here in a little while. </p> <p><strong>6.15pm</strong> (all times eastern from now on): So, polls in most of Indiana and half of Kentucky have closed. In the earliest national exit poll data, which has been dribbling out for a little while now, more than 60% said the economy was their main voting issue. 67% worry about being able to afford healthcare. It's all very different from the \"values\" focus of 2004. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/04/election.president/index.html\">Here's more.</a> Karl Rove is burbling away on Fox at the moment; he says it's the first time since he was 18 years old that he hasn't been directly involved in a presidential election...</p> <p><strong>6.21pm</strong> From the comments: nice to know we're being read in the San Francisco Obama phonebank headquarters, while commenter <strong>evalgoiavot</strong> notes: \"I just watched three epidsodes of battlestar galactica back to back to relieve the tension. I DEMAND CERTAINTY! and also more whisky.\"]</p> <p><strong>6.29pm</strong> For ceremonial reasons, let's mark the first results of the election, even though they're completely meaningless: with fewer than one per cent of votes in, Obama leads McCain 55%-44% in Indiana, while McCain, amazingly enough, leads in Kentucky.</p> <p><strong>6.47pm</strong> OK, back after brief technical issues. Apologies. 13 minutes until polls close in Florida, Georgia, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia. Many fantastic comments. </p> <p><strong>6.55pm</strong> The first state exit polls, which are leaking in various places, look a fair bit tighter than some of the polls. Leads of 4%, 2%, 1% and 1% respectively for Obama in PA, VA, FL and OH. But we know there are <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/ten-reasons-why-you-should-ignore-exit.html\">lots of reasons to distrust exit polls</a>, right?</p> <p><strong>6.56pm</strong> Judging by the comments, almost all of you have better food and drink than me tonight. Thanks for that. Also, where are CNN's holograms -- huh?</p> <p><strong>7.00pm</strong> Polls close in Florida, Georgia, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia. <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/steve-schmidt-remarks-on-straight-talk-air/?xid=rss-page\">Here</a> are the final words on the McCain campaign from McCain's senior strategist Steve Schmidt, although to be honest I'm not sure what the heck they mean. \"Crossing the finish line head up\"? </p> <p><strong>7.01pm</strong> CNN and others call <strong>Vermont</strong> for Obama and <strong>Kentucky</strong> for McCain. Entirely unsurprising! So we begin our electoral college vote count:</p> <p><strong>Obama 3 McCain 8</strong></p> <p><strong>7.10pm</strong> MSNBC predicts a House composition of Dem 261 Rep 174 -- a Democratic landslide -- though there's a significant margin of error to that. Meanwhile: the fact that we don't yet have a call on Indiana is surely a sign that it's going to damn close, isn't it? (Oh -- yes, indeed, the networks and AP agree that it's \"too close to call\", as opposed to simply too early to call. So much for my astonishing Punditry Insight.) Mark Warner, the Democrat, is expected to win the Virginia senate seat he's contesting against Jim Gilmore, which makes a Senate net gain of one.</p> <p><strong>Senate Dem net gain +1</strong></p> <p><strong>7.14pm</strong> Let the record show that Wolf Blitzer is, now, finally, talking to holograms on CNN. They look like slightly worse versions of the holograms in Star Wars, and while they probably look amazing to Wolf they just look like superimposed images to everyone else. Money well spent, CNN!</p> <p><strong>7.23pm</strong> Crowds have begun streaming into Grant Park, Chicago, from where I expect soon to hear from Jonathan Freedland; everybody's running madly for a front-row position. I wonder if any of them <a href=\"http://current.com/items/89474691_will_trade_sex_for_obama_tickets\">got them on Craiglist in highly suspicious circumstances</a>? McCain leads 53% to 46% with 2% of precincts in; McCain leading 51% to 48% in Indiana with 12% in. Mike Tomasky <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/nov/05/uselections2008-indiana\">has thoughts</a> on the Indiana situation...</p> <p><strong>7.29pm</strong> OK, real news. Official demographic exit polls, extrapolated to the statewide vote -- a very unreliable exercise -- put Obama at 54%-45% in Virginia and 52%-46% in Indiana. Remember, in 04 the exits said Kerry had won...</p> <p><strong>7.30pm</strong> Polls close in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia; Fox calls <strong>West Virginia</strong> for McCain, which would be Obama 3 McCain 13 -- nobody else is following suit yet.</p> <p><strong>7.35pm</strong> Dan Glaister checks in from outside the Frank Lloyd Wright Ballroom of the Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, where McCain will hold his election night party (although not necessarily attend it, oddly). Two cleaners just left the ballroom. \"Where are all the people, then?\" one said. \"I thought there'd be lots more people than this,\" the other replied. A thrilling atmosphere of excitement, then.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell's seat in Kentucky is too close to call -- a bad sign for the Republicans, and a hint that the Democrats might be in with a shot of their 60-majority goal.</p> <p><strong>7.41pm</strong> Obama;'s at 57%-42% with 80% of precincts reporting, in \"the most bellwether county in the country,\" Vigo County, Indiana, which apparently <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/11/indiana_dems_taking_comfort_fr.php\">has only gone against the national result twice since 1892</a>. Make of it what you will. I'm opening my first beer, but not in a celebratory or commiseratory fashion -- anyway, I'm neutral and unbiased, right? -- but because... well, just because. </p> <p><strong>7.45pm</strong> Networks project <strong>McCain to win South Carolina</strong>. [Clarification: for the purposes of the running total, I'll count as called a state that's called by two of the main networks or by a main network and AP, and of course I'll keep you up to date with conflicting opinions, as with Fox on WV.]</p> <p><strong>Obama 3, McCain 16</strong></p> <p><strong>7.51pm</strong>: Some analysis of exit polls from Ohio and North Carolina, <a href=\"http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/11/north_carolina_and_ohio_exit_p.php\">courtesy of Marc Ambinder</a>: \"In Ohio -- more than 85% say they're worried about the economy; only 16% of Clinton voters are supporting McCain; The share of the black turnout is higher than in 2004; Obama's getting 98% of them. White men and white women are backing McCain -- but very narrowly -- only by three to four points in the exit polls. Obama lost non-college white males by nine points -- that's an improvement over John Kerry's performance.\"</p> <p><strong>8pm</strong>: Polls close in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, DC, Alabama, Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Missouri. Pennsyvlania's the big question, of course, while Missouri is the other to watch. Stand by for a whole bunch of easy calls. </p> <p><strong>8.01pm</strong>: <strong>Massachusetts, Illinois, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, DC called for Obama, Oklahoma and Tennessee to McCain. ME, which splits its votes, Obama 3 McCain 1 (CNN)</strong></p> <p>which makes it...</p> <p><strong>Obama 77 McCain 34</strong></p> <p>NBC calls Pennsylvania and New Hampshire for Obama, too, making it 103 - 34, and marking the failure of McCain's efforts to make Pennsylvania the centrepiece of his last-ditch campaigning in recent weeks. Oh, and now AP too:</p> <p><strong>Obama 103 McCain 34</strong> Obama takes Pennsylvania. Given the fact that we have essentially none of the precincts reporting, this is indicative of a very big win. </p> <p>And Alabama is too close to call? Wow.</p> <p><strong>8.13pm</strong>: In Phoenix, some Young People are singing a song, while wearing blazers. It's all very nice and very Republican. Joe Biden, meanwhile, has been elected senator for Delaware, which is going to be slightly awkward if he becomes vice-president too. Still, he has a fallback, I suppose. And Jeanne Shaheen, the former New Hampshire governor, seems to have won her race against the incumbent John Sununu, who was always incredibly vulnerable. </p> <p><strong>Senate Dem net gain +2</strong></p> <p><strong>8.22pm</strong>: Ezra Klein <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=11&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=pennsylvania_goes_for_obama_al#110645\">has some exit polls</a> I haven't seen, projecting crazy wins for Obama in Florida, Ohio and Virginia. As he points out, they're probably wildly inflated, if remotely accurate at all...</p> <p><strong>8.25pm</strong>: Ah, <em>marvellous</em>: problems with voting in West Palm Beach, Florida, where absentee ballots, at any rate, appear to require voters to join two boxes together by drawing another box, which is more like a Mensa puzzle than a ballot paper. </p> <p><strong>8.30pm</strong>: Slightly late with this, sorry, but the networks are projecting that Elizabeth Dole, who spent the last part of her campaign accusing Democratic challenger Kay Hagan of being <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/11/atheist-baiter_dole_didnt_have.php\">on the side of the evil godless atheists</a>, has been seriously defeated in North Carolina.</p> <p>Polls are closing in Arkansas, which McCain's going to win. </p> <p><strong>8.35pm</strong>: Arkansas, Alabama for McCain...</p> <p><strong>Obama 103, McCain 49</strong></p> <p>...and hints that Georgia is about to go to McCain, too.</p> <p>OK, I'm <strong>moving to a new thread</strong>: please go <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/nov/05/uselections2008-barackobama\">here.</a></p>",
  "<p>It was hardly a ringing vote of endorsement. Even the father of John McCain's talismanic supporter, Joe the Plumber, was pessimistic about the Republican candidate's chances of reaching the White House as the US went to the polls today.</p> <p>\"I have no confidence whatsoever,\" Frank Wurzelbacher told the Guardian, leaning on his car outside the family bungalow on a leafy residential street. \"I just hope and pray.\"</p> <p>The working-class town of Holland, on the outskirts of Toledo's industrial sprawl, has taken a prominent spot on the political map thanks to Frank's son, Samuel \"Joe\" Wurzelbacher, who confronted Barack Obama about his tax-raising plans in one of the defining moments of the presidential election. Wurzelbacher was adopted by the McCain campaign as the epitome of hard-working, aspirational America and was whisked off to appear at rallies across the nation.</p> <p>\"I wouldn't say it's been fun,\" says Joe's father. \"It's been stressful. We're boring people. I'm not much of a party kind of a person. The word 'strange' doesn't begin to say what this has been like.\"</p> <p>Polls have given Barack Obama a lead of 2 to 3 percentage points in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ohio\">Ohio</a>, a bellwether state which has backed the winning candidate in every presidential election since 1960. Four years ago, President Bush won Ohio by a wafer-thin margin of 118,000 out of 5.6m votes cast, prompting angry complaints from Democrats of voting irregularities.</p> <p>Not everybody is enamoured of the town's newly famous plumber. Angela Zimmann, a 35-year-old university teacher, said she was voting for Obama. \"I feel like Joe the Plumber has a lot in common with Sarah Palin,\" she said. \"He's someone who's not necessarily educated for a position or experienced, but who says something that the Republicans can grab hold of.\"</p> <p>Others were more sympathetic. Shelly Lynch, a petrol station clerk who knows Wurzelbacher as a customer, said: \"I understand where he's coming from. Obama's plans are going to make things impossible for small business owners.\"</p> <p>At the root of Wurzelbacher's gripe was that he hoped to buy his former employer's plumbing business. He claimed that Obama's plan to raise taxes for those earning more than $250,000 would make this difficult.</p> <p>In the local sports bar, Ralphie's, part-time barman Matt Hoover is a plumber who trained with Wurzelbacher. He is sceptical of his peer's claim. \"He was a bit arrogant,\" recalls Hoover, who recalls that even when Wurzelbacher was still learning his trade, he was insisting he was set to buy his employer's company. \"He's been saying that for years and he's never done it.\"</p> <p>Still, Wurzelbacher's political views chime with Hoover's, who takes exception to Obama's desire to redistribute wealth: \"I don't think we should spread the wealth around. If you don't have the money, you should go out, get a job and make it yourself. People act like they're entitled.\"</p> <p>Joe the Plumber has become something of a cult figure. Republicans wear T-shirts showing Wurzelbacher's bald head with slogans such as \"no more drips in the White House\". He is launching a website, writing a book and is even rumoured to be considering trying his hand at country music singing. Such is his celebrity that a policeman let him off a speeding ticket last week, alarmed by complaints that the plumber was being victimised.</p>",

  "<p>Given my particular political persuasion (I tend to listen to conservatives' fever dreams about Obama's clandestine plots to raise an army of gay babies and feminazis who will forcibly submit America to a radical socialist agenda, and think, \"If only!\"), I've had my share of problems with Obama as a candidate, given that policy-wise he is, in reality, a pretty standard corporate-y centrist.</p> <p>He has frequently struck me as more opportunistic than courageous. What is often described as his being preternaturally calm sometimes worries me as actually a lack of the passion that seems requisite for an effective presidency. He's not nearly the ally to women or the LGBTQI community I'd like.</p> <p>But when I walked into the voting booth, I cast my vote for Barack Obama.</p> <p>Part of it is that I am <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/10/justice-for-all.html\">an economy voter</a> who believes quite genuinely and undeterrably that the economy lies at the root of every single progressive issue. Part of it was the quantifiable change <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/30/uselections2008-barackobama\">he has already delivered</a>, the sheer thrill at the thought that <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/06/obama.html\">he may be</a> the first Illinois legislator to occupy the White House since Abraham Lincoln \u2013 that's an impressive set of bookends right there.</p> <p>And part of it is this: my vote counts this time.</p> <p>During every presidential election in which I could vote, I have either lived in Chicago or in the Chicago suburbs of Northwest Indiana (which is where I currently reside). Illinois is bluer than blue. Indiana is redder than red.</p> <p>Pardon me. Indiana <em>was</em> redder than red.</p> <p>In 2004, Bush won Indiana by 21 points. Indiana has never gone for a Democratic in my entire lifetime. It is now, suddenly, a swing state in which Obama is competitive. Every vote is going to matter. <em>My vote</em> is going to matter.</p> <p>Part of that is, of course, widespread disillusionment with the Republican party on the national level \u2013 and an increasingly unpopular Republican governor who may lose his seat to a Democratic challenger who would be the first female governor of the state. But disillusionment is not enough to turn blue a state that was called for Bush by lunchtime last time around. There had to be somewhere for disaffected red voters to go.</p> <p>And that's Obama's doing.

  "<p>American presidential elections provide a near perfect test to understand the difference between European and Asian world views, even if the two continents are far from united internally. If you want America to lead by the power of example, you favour Barack Obama; if you want to be reassured by the continuation of America's power in a traditional security sense, you probably prefer John McCain. </p> <p>Whereas a majority of Europeans \u2013 with the exception of those who for historical and geographic reasons are obsessed with the return of the \"Russian bear\" \u2013 support Obama, a majority of Asians, particular among the elite, seem to support McCain. This difference stems above all from strategic considerations, but it probably also contains a cultural dimension. </p> <p>In Asia, Indonesia may look \"European\" in its <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95600966\">Obama craze</a>, but it essentially constitutes an anomaly, easily explainable by Obama's brief Indonesian upbringing. Otherwise, and for very different reasons, a majority of Asian elites are awaiting the growing possibility of an Obama victory with some bewilderment and even apprehension. For example, Japanese elites tend to favour continuity over change. </p> <p>In their mind, the hard power of the United States is more important than its soft power, and their vision of an America \"bound to lead\" is largely unchanged. For them, the US is above all the strategic counterweight needed to balance China. </p> <p>But the Chinese, too, may very likely be favouring McCain, for the opposite reason. The decline of America's image and influence in the world does not annoy them. As Asia's leading power, China has seized the mantle of \"hope\" from the US. America could regain it under Obama, but not under McCain. Why favour change, when continuity works so well? </p> <p>Indian elites reach the same conclusion for different reasons. The Bush years are seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jul/20/india.usa\">positively</a>, for they coincide with the consolidation of India's international status and emergence as America's key diplomatic partner in Asia. In Singapore, ideological considerations reinforce strategic interests. A very conservative regime naturally tends to prefer a Republican candidate over a Democrat. </p> <p>But, beyond strategic considerations, something else must be mentioned (with prudence). It is too early to say that the \"yellow man's burden\" is about to replace Rudyard Kipling's \"<a href=\"http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/Kipling.html\">white man's burden</a>\" in world history. Asians are slow to acknowledge that power entails international responsibility. But Asians who have more than caught up with the west may have difficulty adjusting to the idea that the US would for the first time in history not be headed by a white president. How can you define yourself to the west, when the west has so spectacularly and visibly changed its appearance, if not its essence? </p> <p>In Europe, the reverse is true. The complex essence of Obama is an absolute plus. For the former colonial countries, who have no equivalent to Obama, to support him fully is a sort of exorcism, if not redemption. America is once more paving the way for what Europeans should be able to achieve one day with their own minorities: a land of dreams made possible. In a more classical sense, the depth of anti-Bush sentiment in Europe explains the depth of pro-Obama feeling and Europeans' relative distancing from McCain's candidacy. </p> <p>Europeans have felt oppressed by America's excessive demonstration of hard power. They would not mind an America that was more modest abroad and more ambitious at home. They are in fact secretly wishing that in these tough economic times, at least part of the \"culture of hope\" incarnated by Obama would reverberate on them and transform them for the better. They do not want the US only to protect them, but to transform them. </p> <p>The perception that Obama can transform the view that the US and the west have of themselves is an important factor in the emotional gap that may exist between Asia and Europe on the eve of America's presidential election. On that count, Asia tends to be a status quo continent, while Europe is a revisionist one. For many Europeans, a reinvention of America is Europe's last hope. </p> <p>It is a noble hope, but also a dangerous one, for dreams can easily turn into nightmares. That might very well happen if America's next president fails to redress the financial and economic threats facing his country, and thus the rest of the world. </p> <p><em>Copyright <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a> 2008. </em></p>",
  "<p>Here we are at last. Tonight from <strong>6pm eastern time, 11pm UK</strong> time I'll be liveblogging election night <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/burkeman\">here on this blog</a>, for as long as it takes. (In an earlier post I gave a different start time; I'll be here from 6pm/11pm.) My colleague Daniel Nasaw has written an excellent guide <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/04/us-president-election-guide\">here</a> setting out Obama and McCain's different potential paths to victory. Read it! And if you'll be at an election night party -- an election night party where you're also following my liveblog, <em>naturally</em> -- why not memorise parts of it in advance, in order to sound immensely knowledgeable?</p> <p>Our guideposts through the evening, of course, will be the <strong>poll closing times</strong>; 6pm is closing time in solid red <strong>Kentucky</strong> and in <strong>Indiana</strong>, where an Obama victory would be a sign of a landslide. Once a state's polls close, the Associated Press and the main US television networks will use <strong>exit polls</strong> to begin trying to make a call. In the most clear-cut cases, they'll call the state based either on the exits or after comparing the exits with the very first votes counted, but the closer the state, the longer they'll wait before they're confident. In those closer cases, we'll have access to the demographic data of the exit polls long before the state is called. There are <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/ten-reasons-why-you-should-ignore-exit.html\">numerous reasons not to read too much into them</a>, though they may provide early clues to national changes in the electorate, and to the scale of the predicted record <strong>turnout</strong>, along with the reality or otherwise of such things as the <strong>Bradley effect</strong> and the <strong>cellphone effect</strong>. One of the subsidiary fascinating questions of tonight is what criteria the AP and the networks will use to <strong>call the election</strong>. Given the pitch of the excitement, and the historic nature of the vote, everyone wants to be first. So despite all the <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/vote2004/2004-11-03-tv-election_x.htm\">nervous memories of 2000</a>, if we reach a time before the figures are in from, say, California, Oregon and Hawaii, yet Obama seems to have reached the 270 mark <em>assuming</em> those deep-blue states vote Democratic, it's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/04/us/politics/04network.html\">increasingly hard to imagine</a> that the networks will wait just to make sure McCain doesn't pull off some Alice-in-Wonderland California victory. (There may, of course, be big differences in which network calls the race when: Fox, not just in 2000 but in 2004 too, tends to move with the most alacrity, or prematurity.) Of course, once we're in that kind of situation, you can go to bed -- or go and get drunk -- confident of the result even if the networks are still being coy.</p> <p>I'll bring you every result until we know a winner, along with news of notable developments in the <strong>races for the House and for the Senate</strong>, where the Democrats are yearning for a \"filibuster-proof\" majority of 60 that would make it far easier for a Democratic president to enact his proposals, though any major boost from their current majority (51-49, reliant on Joe Lieberman) would be a big help in that regard. I'll also bring you updates from our excellent team of reporters in Chicago's Grant Park and elsewhere across the country. The liveblog will begin as a single post; if it becomes unwieldy, I'll close it up and direct you to a part two post, and so on as required.</p> <p>Ladies and gentlemen: it's history in the making, and it's right here -- featuring beer, stream-of-consciousness commentary, links to other stream-of-consciousness commentary and lots of Hard Data. I hope you'll join the conversation and keep me updated on where you are in the world and how people there are marking this extraordinary night. Or afternoon, or morning, I suppose, depending on where you are. (Plus we have the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/oct/31/uselections2008-johnmccain2\">Exciting Election Contest!!!</a> to adjudicate -- not that we need much more excitement.)

In some areas of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/virginia\">Virginia</a> lines were forming from 4am, two hours before the polls opened.</p> <p>The Election Protection Coalition, an alliance of several voting-rights groups, collected reports of scattered difficulties at polling stations across the US. Tales of broken ballot scanners and touch-screen voting machines were particularly notable in the swing states of Virginia, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ohio\">Ohio</a>.</p> <p>In Virginia, Ohio, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/indiana\">Indiana</a>, legal skirmishes erupted over the method of counting provisional and absentee ballots, which could determine the margin of victory if the race remains close into the night.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> began his day in Indiana, a once reliably <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans\">Republican</a> state, where he is running neck and neck with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>. \"I think we can win in Indiana, otherwise I wouldn't be in Indiana,\" the Democrat said upon his arrival there.</p> <p>He told reporters that voting with his family \"was a big deal\", adding a quip: \"I noticed that Michelle took a long time, though. I had to check to see who she was voting for.\"</p> <p>In a bizarre twist, reporters waiting for Obama to appear at his local polling station instead spotted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/14/john-mccain-barack-obama-ayers-debate\">Bill Ayers</a>, the 1960s radical whose service on an education board with the Democrat has drawn relentless attacks from McCain. Now a college professor, Ayers lives in the same Chicago neighbourhood as Obama. He declined to answer questions about his vote.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Obama</a> made <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/04/uselections2008-barackobama\">his final appeal last night to a Virginia crowd</a> estimated at 90,000, while <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/johnmccain\">McCain</a> ended his election-eve sprint <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/04/uselections2008-johnmccain\">in his home state of Arizona</a> at 3am.</p> <p>McCain appeared jubilant at an afternoon rally in Colorado, where he told supporters, \"Nothing is inevitable here. I feel momentum. I feel it, you feel it, and we are going to win this election.\"</p> <p>Most <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2008/oct/03/uselections.polltracker.obama.mccain\">national and state polls</a> show the Democratic candidate poised for a decisive victory in the race to capture 270 of the 538 electoral votes required to take the White House.</p> <p>But Obama was making no confident predictions last night as he bade farewell to the reporters who have travelled with him for the past 22 months.</p> <p>\"OK, guys, let's go home. It will be fun to see how the story ends,\" Obama told the gathered press.</p> <p>McCain appeared comfortable with his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/nov/04/mccain-obama-negative-campaigning\">underdog status</a>, insisting to CBS news this morning that there is \"a good scenario\" for him to snatch a shock victory. Yet that scenario would require the Republican to hold all the states won by George Bush in 2004 while unseating Obama in several where the Democrat currently leads.</p> <p>Republican vice-presidential candidate <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> returned to her hometown of Wasilla, Alaska, to cast her vote. \"I hope, pray, believe I will be able to wake up as vice-president-elect,\" she told reporters at her local polling station.</p> <p>Palin raised some eyebrows by declining to reveal whether she voted for Ted Stevens, her home-state Republican senator, who was convicted of criminal corruption last month and faces a likely defeat today. \"I don't have to tell anybody who I vote for,\" Palin said. \"Nobody does, and that's really cool about America, also.\"</p> <p>Her Democratic counterpart, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a>, voted near his Delaware home with his wife, Jill, before travelling to the battleground city of Richmond, Virginia.</p> <p>Obama plans to play a game of basketball, keeping to a voting-day tradition he began during the gruelling Democratic primary race, before joining Biden and their families for - if all goes to plan - a raucous victory party tonight in Chicago's Grant Park. McCain and his Republican team will watch the voters' verdict arrive from their home base in Phoenix.</p> <p>Officials are prepared for a record voter turnout, expecting as many as 140 million Americans to come out for Obama and McCain. The previous turnout high was 121 million voters, reached four years ago.</p> <p>Among the crowds casting votes in the New York suburbs were Hillary and Bill Clinton, who have enthusiastically campaigned for Obama this autumn after weeks of tension following the former first lady's Democratic primary loss.</p> <p>\"Our party tomorrow will wake up with an enormous opportunity but an enormous responsibility,\" the former president Bill Clinton told reporters outside his local polling station.</p> <p>Clinton claimed the presidency 16 years ago without reaching the 50% majority that most major polls have predicted Obama is poised to hit today. The last Democrat to achieve a 50% result was Jimmy Carter in 1976.</p> <p>One factor working in the electorate's favour was the weather, with most regions of the nation forecasting balmy temperatures that make queuing to vote a less unpleasant experience. The first polls in swing states close early evening in America, raising the possibility that the winner could be known before 2am GMT.</p> <p>Even in the capital city of Washington, where Obama could win as much as 90% of the vote, hundreds of people crowded the streets clutching cups of coffee as they waited to participate.</p>",
  "<p>When the ANC president, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d3e0a3da-a9f3-11dd-958b-000077b07658.html\">Jacob Zuma</a>,addressed a packed 20,000 crowd in Soweto on Saturday one of the preachers present evoked murmurs of assent when he said that \"Zuma has not been selected by the people only. Anyone who fights him is fighting Nkulunkulu (the Supreme Being) personally.\" </p> <p>In fact, Zuma's rally was one of a whole series of ANC gambits aimed at drawing attention away from the national convention organised in Johannesburg at the weekend by the ANC dissidents, led by Terror Lekota and Sam Shilowa, who are intent on launching a new party <a href=\"http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnLN141839.html\">to compete with the ANC</a> in next April's general election. </p> <p>But the gambits failed: some 5,000 delegates packed the convention which was shrouded in one-nation euphoria as speakers from all races and parties were given a rapturous reception and the media gave it blanket coverage, all claiming that it had \"changed South African politics forever\".</p> <p>In the weeks before the convention, the various front organisations of the Communist party (the SACP) and in particular the various constituent unions of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has rained down denunciations of Lekota, Shilowa and anyone likely to support them, but this was merely an index of how thoroughly the SACP has colonised the Cosatu unions and the ANC itself \u2013 the SACP chairman, Gwede Mantashe, is now the ANC Secretary-General and the party's most forceful and frequent spokesman. But although the ANC is the party in possession \u2013 it has power, patronage, the symbols and history, the long-faithful voters \u2013 it has clearly been taken aback by the speed and degree to which the breakaway faction is developing. </p> <p>Lekota and his supporters now challenge the party head on in a way it is simply not used to: what is wrong with being middle class, Lekota asks? Do we all have to do what an SACP of only 20,000 members tells us ? Moreover, to Cosatu's considerable alarm, Willie Madisha, the former Cosatu chairman expelled for his refusal to back Zuma, is deep in talks to set up a new non-political labour federation which will doubtless entice many members away from Cosatu.</p> <p>South African politics has always been ethnic and regional. The convention's organisers showed their hand when they allocated 500 delegates each to the East, West and Northern Cape, the NorthWest and the Free State, for it is in these five provinces that they feel most confident of their support \u2013 indeed Lekota predicted to me that the ANC could no longer win any of them.<br> Only 300 delegates each were allocated to Mpumalanga, Limpopo and Gauteng (which includes Johannesburg) and only 200 to Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Already, there are strong mutterings that Zuma's Zulu followers will make the latter a no-go area for the dissidents.</p> <p>What no one is saying is that the breakaway can only gain serious traction if it exploits tribal lines of cleavage. These are already evident: the three Cape provinces are predominantly Xhosa and it is clear that the dissidents will draw their principal support from this group, which feels dispossessed by the sight of a Xhosa President, Thabo Mbeki, being thrown out by a Zulu. Lekota himself is a South Sotho from the Free State and the Tswanas who populate the NorthWest are essentially just Western Sotho. At the convention Lekota spoke in English, Afrikaans \u2013 and Xhosa, for they were the dominant group: over a thousand delegates arrived from the Eastern Cape alone (despite the quota). This is the province where most Xhosas live and where the most confident predictions of dissident success are being made.</p> <p>Similarly, the key fact about Zuma's Soweto rally was that he spoke almost exclusively in Zulu: doubtless the language of most of the audience. Zulus are passionate about the notion that after three successive Xhosas \u2013 Tambo, Mandela and Mbeki \u2013 the Zulus, the biggest tribe, must provide the next ANC leader. It is this passionate enthusiasm which explains the invocations of the Almighty on Zuma's side.</p> <p>But this means massive violence, especially in ethnically mixed areas like Gauteng, for there is little doubt that the parties will seek to control \"their\" communities. No one is saying this yet. But we could well be in for a return to civil strife on a scale not witnessed since the early 1990s.</p>",

  "<p>Some folks point to the exit polls in 2004 showing John Kerry with a convincing victory <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10432334/was_the_2004_election_stolen/print\">as evidence that the election was stolen</a>. While there are plenty of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_United_States_election_voting_controversies\">well-researched examples of irregularities</a>, the exit polls just prove that they were wrong, not that the election was stolen. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/ten-reasons-why-you-should-ignore-exit.html\">Nate Silver of fivethirtyeight.com gives you ten reasons to ignore exit polls</a>. Just look at his top reason:</p> <blockquote> <p>Exit polls have a much larger intrinsic margin for error than regular polls. </p> </blockquote> <p>Exit polls also tend to over-sample Democrats. They overstated Barack Obama's performance by 7 points during the primaries. Just ignore them, especially the ones that will leak before the polls close. </p> <p>Patience. We might <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/04/us/politics/04network.html?_r=1&amp;em&amp;oref=slogin\">have a result by 2000 EST, 0100 GMT</a>. I think that's really optimistic.

  "<p>According to one of the premier poll analysts, Nate Silver of <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/\">FiveThirtyEight.com</a>, the presidential race has come down <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/todays-polls-111.html\">to five states</a>: Virginia, Colorado, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania. In fact, given that Colorado polls anywhere from 5% to 10% for Obama, the race essentially comes down to Pennsylvania.</p> <p>If Obama wins Pennsylvania, he wins the presidency.</p> <p>Still, McCain's decision to quit Colorado altogether and concentrate on Pennsylvania led to some head-scratching among pundits. At the time, Obama enjoyed double-digit leads in the Pennsylvania polls, while Colorado stayed in the low single-digits. Why dump resources and spend time stumping in Pennsylvania, when that looks like a higher hill to climb?</p> <p>Al Giordano wrote a prescient post more than a week ago, speculating on McCain's <a href=\"http://narcosphere.narconews.com/thefield/panic-room-whats-mccains-pennsylvania-gambit\">Pennsylvania gambit</a>, guessing that McCain wanted to chip away at Obama's lead there to create the sense of momentum by using low-road campaigning:</p> <blockquote> <p>And if they're really going to go there - to try to make the campaign about race and, specifically, some white people's fears of pigmentation - then it would make total sense for McCain to temporarily ignore Colorado, where that message ain't gonna hunt, and shift focus to Appalachia and the South: Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio and, yes, Pennsylvania and even Florida being the swing states where racially charged politics have sometimes, in the past, worked for the Republicans, or, in Appalachia, where they worked for the Clintons during the primaries.</p> </blockquote> <p>(As if on cue, the Pennsylvania Republican party began airing its Reverend Wright ads <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/11/pennsylvania_gop_ad.php\">this weekend</a>.)</p> <p>Erie, Pennsylvania, where I moved recently and where I've been doing a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/28/election-race-obama-pennsylvania\"> fair amount of canvassing</a> for Obama, seems like a good place for McCain to wedge issues of race and religion between long-time Democrats and their nominee this election. That's probably one of the reasons Sarah Palin <a href=\"http://www.buffalonews.com/180/story/479605.html\">visited the city</a> late last week. After attending a \"national security roundtable\" with a panel of McCain foreign policy advisers, Palin appeared at the convention centre on Presque Isle Bay before a crowd of some 6,000 of her devoted fans. During the Erie speech, Palin brought out a new strain in rhetoric, questioning Obama's national security credentials, an odd choice for the region, whose biggest issues are related to the economy: taxes, jobs and healthcare.</p> <p>Did Palin's visit have much effect on the city's voters? It's hard to answer that question definitively without polling data, but my guess is that she didn't. If anything, it might have pushed more people into Obama's camp. It's a gut feeling, of course, but over the past few weeks as I've spoken to Erie voters on the phones and at the doors, a lot of undecided voters are opting for Obama and against McCain because of Palin. A lot of these people are traditional blue-collar Democrats who might have opted for a Republican who they saw as an independent. However, Palin's far-right brand of conservatism has turned off a lot of moderates here in Erie.</p> <p>My gut feeling jibes with recent polling data that shows Palin's favourability ratings are low, and have been slipping ever since she burst onto the political scene at the Republican National Convention. In <a href=\"http://blogs.usatoday.com/onpolitics/2008/11/final-usa-today.html\">Sunday's USA Today/Gallup poll</a>, 49% of those polled view Palin unfavourably \u2013 by far the lowest rating of any of the four front-ticket candidates. Incidentally, that same poll showed Obama with a 62% favourable rating; the highest rating of any candidate at this stage of the election since 1992. Palin's lack of experience, the ethics scandals and other controversies that dog her and her attempts to polarize the electorate have backfired.</p> <p>And even if Palin did have a positive reputation among voters, and even if her appearance softened her ticket's reception in the city, it seems too little, too late. </p> <p>Whatever bump Palin's appearance in Erie had will probably be erased, and then some, by <a href=\"http://www.meadvilletribune.com/local/local_story_308221933.html\">Bill Clinton's appearance</a> here yesterday. Erie, after all, swooned for Hillary Clinton in the spring. Obama also has a decided advantage in his ground game \u2013 the number of volunteers have picked up steadily. Supporters drive in from Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburg. Unions mobilise and Erie supporters are emerging from their mid-election complacency to work the last get-out-the-vote push. McCain's ground game, on the other hand, is invisible, if it exists at all. The county and state Republican party is leading whatever effort there is in Erie, although it appears limited to lawn signs and anti-abortion fliers stuck on the windshields of cars in Catholic church parking lots. </p> <p>In the end, the enthusiasm for the Republican ticket in Erie seems limited to the party's narrowest base \u2013 conservative Christians \u2013 and even that enthusiasm seems reserved exclusively for Palin.</p> <p>Palin's stop in Erie seemed to confirm that. While I missed the speech itself \u2013 and by all accounts the atmosphere inside the convention centre was raucous and positive \u2013 I managed to slip down to the bay as the rally ended and the crowd pushed out into the parking lot and down the Seaway Trail to their cars. The crowd was mostly women, many wearing bright pink \"McCain/Palin\" or \"Palin Power\" shirts, clutching \"Country First\" signs. It was a subdued crowd, though. There wasn't much cheering or ebullience. Most of the discussion I heard was about Palin's chances in 2012. Even the omnipresent Obama sign-holders met with half-hearted bitterness and the occasional \"communist\" thrown out the window of a passing SUV.</p> <p>Once the crowd dissipated \u2013 off to the suburbs? \u2013 and Palin's motorcade swept down Bayview, the city resumed its usual personality. And as I biked back down the trail toward Frontier Park and home, it was the sole Obama sign \u2013 not the \"Country First\" placards still in sight \u2013 that earned the thumbs-up and honking from the afternoon commuters.</p>",

  "<p>With markets on both sides of the Atlantic buoyed by the Barack Obama effect on US election day, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> headed north for the sixth day in a row.</p> <p>The leading index closed 196.22 points higher at 4639.5, its highest level since 3 October. If the run extends to a seventh day tomorrow, it will be the FTSE 100's best performance since July 2005.

  "<p>Judgment day has arrived for US voters and in the green arena there has been much debate over which candidate would be the biggest hitter for the environment.</p> <p>The easy verdict is that both would be far better than George W Bush, but that's not hard. Cutting to the chase, I reckon Barack Obama is ahead \u2013 which is good as he looks very likely to win.</p> <p>He has been attacked for his enthusiasm for coal-to-liquids and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/27/ethanol-barack-obam\">ethanol based-biofuels</a>.

  "<p>\"We've had 50% early voting in this precinct,\" said the poll worker as he surveyed the near empty car park outside the polling station at Prescott's United Methodist church shortly after 7am on election day. \"In previous years we've had barely any.\"</p> <p>At several polling stations in this city of 40,000, where John McCain had made his last stand just hours before, voters were conspicuous by their absence. There were no lines, no rival groups of supporters, just poll workers peeping out of the closed doors of polling stations or watching over the trickle of morning voters.</p> <p>And the voters who did go out to vote were far from typical for what is supposed to be a Republican stronghold.</p> <p>\"This time around I saw a need for change and for hope,\" said Robert Espitia, sounding a little like a campaign commercial. \"In the previous two elections I didn't vote, and I was undecided this year at the beginning. Honest to God, I hope they finally do something about healthcare and education.\"</p> <p>Despite the paltry morning turnout, election officials in Yavapai County predicted a 90-95% turnout. From an electorate of 118,000, 48,000 early ballots had been received by Monday afternoon.</p> <p>One early voter, Kenneth Ernst, checked in at his local polling station just to make sure everything was O.K. \"I heard there were going to be long lines,\" he said. </p> <p>In common with several voters, he said he had been put off by the tone of the campaign. \"There was a lot of bashing, and I don't like that kind of stuff,\" he said. </p> <p>Susan Smith, voting in the city's historic district, said that she was motivated to vote by a desire to see America engage with the rest of the world in a constructive way. \"Why can't we try to get along with other countries,\" she asked. \"Let's talk to them, find out what's wrong rather than imposing our opinions on them.\"</p> <p>In Prescott's picturesque town plaza, where McCain had made his last pitch in the early hours of the morning before several thousand supporters \u2013 and several hundred opponents \u2013 workers were clearing away the barricades and the litter, returning the square to its previous state.</p> <p>Would Arizona return to its previous state and turn Democratic? \"Historically this was a Democratic state,\" said Smith. \"But with the retirement communities and the snowbirds it sort of changed.\"</p> <p>It will be a long shot, but with some recent polls showing McCain holding just a two-point advantage in his home state, it may not be impossible. Certainly, the mood in the Republican redoubt of Prescott suggested uncertainty among the city's Republicans and optimism among its Democrats.</p>",
  "<p>In polls conducted immediately after the Republican national convention in September, John McCain finally overtook Barack Obama and seemed poised to win a trip to the White House this month. He had rallied the party base. He had invigorated the independents. He had won the kudos of the Great Unwashed. And he had firmly established himself in the consciousness of his countrymen as that quintessential American icon: the lone wolf, he who marches to the beat of a different drummer, the maverick.</p> <p>Then, something truly astonishing occurred. Tina Fey, the lantern-jawed alumnus of Saturday Night Live, and creator of the critically esteemed sitcom <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/30_Rock/\">30 Rock</a>, made a return visit to Saturday Night Live and began doing a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/oct/21/comedy-sarahpalin\">dead-on impersonation</a> of McCain's gee-whiz, aw-shucks running mate, Sarah Palin. Her send-up of the intellectually anaemic Alaskan was seen by countless millions on YouTube and soon became the No1 topic of conversation in America. Almost overnight, McCain's poll numbers began to drop precipitously, as the arrayed forces of electronically transmitted satire rained down on the GOP ticket. Before you knew it, Palin was viewed as a clown, a dolt, a joke, and McCain was condemned as a nitwit for selecting her as his running mate. For the first time in American history, a presidential candidate had seen all his hopes and dreams undone by the sheer emotive power of naked, unalloyed satire.</p> <p>Obviously, Ms Fey did not accomplish this all by herself. Clearly, the savage nightly attacks by Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart played an important role in softening up the target. Surely the satirical tabloid <a href=\"http://www.theonion.com/content/index\">The Onion</a> should get some credit here. Without a doubt, the withering contempt of Bill Maher and Michael Moore played a vital role in causing the Republican colossus to come crashing to earth. </p> <p>But the truth is, Moore and Maher and Stewart and Colbert had been flaying the Republican party for years without any notable effect. Not until Tina Fey stepped into the ring and began eviscerating the hapless Palin did the tide truly begin to turn. Like Horatius at the bridge, like William Tell versus the Austrian invaders, like George Washington at Valley Forge, Ms Fey had come to the aid of her country at the moment her country needed her most. She serviced it with a smile.</p> <p>Whatever one's political orientation, there can be no denying that 2008 is the year that satire \u2013 previously, the weak stepsister of sarcasm \u2013 finally came to the fore in American political life, unleashing a tsunami of politically-charged ridicule and invective that has changed the republic forever. This triumph has been a long time in coming.</p> <p>Satire was notably ineffective when used against Richard Nixon in 1968 and 1972, the year he won one of the most lopsided victories in history. Satire did not work against Ronald Reagan, universally dismissed as a dunce by pundits, wits and wiseacres. Nor did it have much effect on George HW Bush when he squared off against the mirthless Michael Dukakis in 1988. </p> <p>Satire was equally impotent when used against George W Bush in 2000 and 2004, despite his big ears and malapropisms and earthy diction and overall resemblance to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_E._Neuman\">Alfred E Neuman</a> and the widespread perception among those who ply their trade in the pith industry that he was a hapless dunce.</p> <p>Why, then, has satire been so effective in 2008, when it had almost no effect on previous races? Two reasons. One: the material is better crafted, researched and delivered than ever before. Colbert and his ilk are simply funnier than Tom Wolfe and PJ O'Rourke and Woody Allen and Mark Twain and all the other satirists who preceded them. </p> <p>Two, the viral element has come into play, enabling brilliant pieces like Fey's Sarah Palin shtick to be seen by tens of millions of people who do not want to sit through an entire broadcast of Saturday Night Live. Satire, previously thought of as a harmless derringer or an unreliable fowling weapon, has found a delivery system that renders it lethal. Satire has gone nuclear.</p> <p>Spoilsports may argue that satire alone could not have wrecked the McCain campaign. Surely, they will argue, the implosion of the housing market, a 40% decline in the value of the Dow wiping out $7tn in shareholder equity, the disappearance of several of the largest banks in the United States, and the loss of millions of jobs have contributed to McCain's slump in the polls. Surely, the debacle in Iraq, the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan and the inability of the Republican party to bring Osama bin Laden to justice have had some effect on the outcome of the race.</p> <p>Perhaps. But that effect has been negligible. A presidential candidate can sidestep a controversial issue such as the grim spectre of another Great Depression. A candidate can dance around two failed wars, a trillion-dollar deficit, the instantaneous disappearance of several million jobs, or having a bunch of high-level cabinet posts staffed by clowns. </p> <p>But not even the most gifted candidate can defend himself against the combined, cohesive forces of unilaterally condescending satire. Those whom the gods would destroy they first make ridiculous. A Great Depression is merely the icing on the cake.</p>",

This is a boost to its morale.\"</p> <p>Kordan's job included domestic security as well as organising next summer's presidential elections, when the hardline Ahmadinejad is expected to stand for a second term. The vote suggests the president's chances of winning again may be diminishing.</p> <p>Ali Larijani, the parliamentary speaker, said 188 deputies among the 247 present in the 290-member assembly voted to sack Kordan. \"The impeachment was approved by parliament and he cannot be interior minister from now on,\" he added.</p> <p>Kordan, a former revolutionary guard, accused the media of a smear campaign by portraying him as a \"terrorist,\" naming Israel Radio and Persian-language media based outside Iran. </p> <p>The Kordan saga began in August when parliament, which vets ministerial appointments, voted on his confirmation. When MPs questioned his eligibility he produced a certificate purporting to be an \"honorary doctorate of law\" from Oxford University and was approved by a slim margin.</p> <p>Within days Iranian journalists were following up claims that the degree was bogus. Kordan released a copy of the document to quell speculation. <br>But Alef, a website associated with one of Ahmadinejad's critics, pointed to typing errors, garbled English and misspellings, purportedly signed by three Oxford professors.</p> <p>The certificate commended Kordan for \"preparing educational materials\" and for \"research in the domain of comparative law that has opened a new chapter not only in our university but, to our knowledge, this country\". Alef passed the certificate to Oxford, which disavowed it. The Iranian government then blocked Alef's website from the internet.</p> <p>It also transpired later that Kordan did not receive a bachelor's degree or master's degree from Iran's Open University, as he had claimed.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad defended him by saying he should not be judged on a \"piece of torn paper\", a phrase he has used to dismiss UN resolutions against Iran's nuclear programme.</p> <p>One MP commented that the president could have won millions of votes by simply dismissing Kordan and that his support for the minister would cost him those votes next summer.</p> <p>\"Ahmadinejad is becoming more and more vulnerable,\" said commentator Saeed Leylaz. \"The vote showed that the prospect of winning the next election is dim for him.\" </p> <p>Ahmadinejad, president since 2005, is notorious in the west for his comments on Israel and the Nazi Holocaust. But most Iranians care more about the economic incompetence he has demonstrated in recent months.</p> <p>Declining oil revenues have exposed his populist spending plans and left the state coffers all but empty. In July he predicted oil prices would never fall below $100 per barrel. Prices today were around $63 a barrel. </p> <p>Last week the Tehran stock market plunged 12% to its lowest close in years. Inflation is estimated at 27% or more. </p> <p>Analysts and diplomats say a key question over the coming months will be the attitude of Iran's unelected supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who sits at the apex of the political system and has so far backed the president.</p> <h2>Ali Kordan joke box</h2> <p>A spoof \"Oxford\" dictionary circulating among Tehran university students lists the following entries:</p> <p><strong>Kordanize (v)</strong><br>1.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> See that fresh-faced young whippersnapper hunkering down on his mark beside the scythe-wielding skeleton in the black cowl? That's Liverpool striker Fernando Torres, who's in a race against Time to be fit for Liverpool's encounter with his former team at Anfield tonight after suffering the customary bout of hamstring-twang that befalls him whenever he embarks on international duty for Spain. I hope he lines up for no other reason than that I like watching him play; there are few enough reasons to look forward to Champions League matches in the first group stages, what with Group D being just one of many in the competition that's as good as decided with three games to go.</p> <p>One man who'll definitely sit out tonight's encounter is Atletico coach Javier Aguirre, who begins a two-match touchline ban for some indiscretion or other. \"We want to play against a fully fit Fernando Torres so we can measure ourselves to see how we do against a full-strength Liverpool,\" he said. \"We have taken this competition so seriously and we have done very well up to now, but we can't appraise our success until the six games of the first phase have been completed.\" Atletico currently sit joint top of their group with Liverpool on seven points after three games, PSV are next with three, while Marseille have none.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Team news:</strong> The scythe-wielding skeleton in the black cowl breasted the tape first - Torres isn't even on the bench. </p> <p><strong>Liverpool:</strong> Reina, Arbeloa, Carragher, Agger, Aurelio,<br>Mascherano, Alonso, Kuyt, Gerrard, Riera, Keane. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Cavalieri, Dossena, Benayoun, Babel, Leiva Lucas, Ngog, Degen.</p> <p><strong>Atletico Madrid: </strong>Franco, Antonio Lopez, Perea, Heitinga,<br>Pernia, Raul Garcia, Paulo Assuncao, Maniche, Maxi, Forlan, Simao. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Coupet, Luis Garcia, Aguero, Sinama Pongolle,<br>Banega, Pablo, Camacho.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> The teams emerge from the dug-out, with by far and away the majority of them exchanging pleasantries in Spanish considering all the Spaniards, Argentinians, Uruguayans and what not involved. Despite Fernando Torres' absence, Liverpool's team contains more actual Spaniards than Atletico's, with Robbie Keane being the lone English-speaker in both sides. The funny thing is that his native language is actually Irish. Confused? Good. <br>Atletico, who have left Sergio Aguera on their bench in order to facilitate an extra midfielder, kick off.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> A corner for Liverpool results in a close shave for Atletico - Agger appeals for a penalty after being denied a clean shot on goal by Simao. He thought he'd been fouled, but the referee didn't agree.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Pernia attempts to cross from the left for Diego Forlan, but his effort is blocked. Moments later, Maxi Rodriguez tries to cross from the other flank, but his delivery is headed clear. This match has started at a cracking pace.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Replays of that incident where Agger thought he should have got a penalty are inconclusive. The camera pans to Fernando Torres, who is sitting in the stand with an open-necked shirt, pullover and anorak type thing. Flash git!</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>7 mins:</strong> \"Dear Fiver and tonight's MBMers,\" writes Tom Chivers. \"Regarding your always-amusing 'Follow Chelsea's laboured 1-0 win over whomever etc' lines in the Fiver: I've always wondered whether, if one consistently put money on your tips, one would actually turn a profit. To that end I've stuck a fiver (appropriately enough) on each of tonight's MBMs - a 2-1 win for the Pool and 0-1 for Chelsea, as augured. In the spirit of scientific enquiry I'm setting up a time-limited experiment - I'll do this to the end of the group stages on all the English teams' games (total \u00a360) and see whether I'm plus or minus on the deal. My financial future is now in your hands.\" </p> <p>Well, far be it from me to tell you how to spend your money, Tom, but do the words \"credit\" and \"crunch\" mean anything to you? That said, it's probably less risky giving your money to the money-grabbing gits at Ladbroke's or Coral than the even more avaricious ones at Bradford &amp; Bingley or Lloyds.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Liverpool win a corner, which Steven Gerrard sends in to the box. Atletico's Argentinian goalkeeper Leo Franco clears with a less than inspired punch.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> \"Granted he wielded a scythe, but Old Father Time is usually portrayed as a genial old fellow rather than the cowled skellington of Death,\" writes Steve Gaw. \"But rather than being pedantic and after casting my vote for Obama this morning, I have much more important issues to follow on this historic day: two hours of meaningless Group D action interspersed with high-class banter from Gary Naylor.\"</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Robbie Keane controls a wonderful 50-yard diagonal ball pass from Xabi Alonso with his chest, then shoots into the side-netting from 20 yards. Excellent pass, excellent control and a good effort.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Robbie Keane is not the only person on the Liverpool team who speaks English as his first language,\" writes Chad Biedle-Baker in New York. \"What about Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carra ... oh.\"</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> With the home fans booing with the kind of self-righteous sanctimony that they do so well, Atletico embark on a lightning-fast counter-attack while a Liveprool player goes to ground with a minor injury after a rather blatant Atletico handball. The ball is crossed from the left to Simao, who blasts it high over the cross-bar from seven or eight yards with only the goalkeeper, Reina, to beat. His reaction is one of acute embarrassment and rightfully so.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> \"Regarding Tom Chivers's email at seven minutes: is this the first time someone has had the same email published in two MBMs at the same time?\" asks Philip Smith, who appears to be labouring under the delusion that I read minute-by-minute reports that I'm not writing. \"Also, am I correct in saying that you're getting considerably more emails than Rob Smyth, who was able to print Tom's missive before his match had even started? Or is it just because you don't read your emails as much?\"</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Xabi Alonso pings an inch-perfect diagonal pass towards the far post, where Riera just fails to make decent contact under pressure from Antonio Lopez.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> \"I can go down to the fitness center and ask them to switch to ESPN2 (from some meaningless early election coverage on CNN) so I can watch the match, or I can stay in my office pretending to work and follow the match via MBM,\" writes Joe Pearson. \"Your recommendation?\" </p> <p>If you're sitting in the office when you don't have to be there, my recommendation is that you go out for a drink or go home. It doesn't matter who wins this match because both teams are going to go through to the second round whatever the outcome tonight. I remember a time, many years ago, when exciting European Cup matches were the rule, not the exception.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Liverpool midfielder Javier Mascherano curls a cross into the penalty area which Dirk Kuyt flings himself at headfirst and misses.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> \"According to today's <a href=\"http://football.theguardian.com/fiver/0,,415657,00.html\">Fiver</a>, Modena have employed a Benedictine monk to banish their poor form withy an exorcism,\" writes Justin Kavanagh. \"Why can't Liverpool get an exorcist to lift their league curse? They already have a rotating head coach and at least two local lads speakin' in tongues, la?!\"</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> It's all Liverpool here. Riera sends a marvellous delivery into the Atletico box, Steven Gerrard controls well and is denied what looks a certain goal by the crucial intervention of Luis Perea. Moments later, Robbie Keane is foiled in his attempts to put Liverpool one up by some good goalkeeping when Leo Franco rushes off his line to intercept a through-ball which the Irishman was attempting to latch on to.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Liverpool turn the screw. Mascherano crosses from the right, but Atletico left-back Perea hoofs clear.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Liverpool 0 - 1 Atletico Madrid (Maxi 37)</strong> That's a cracking goal on the counter-attack. Atletico centre-back Hettinga sent a long ball up towards the right wing, where gallloping full-back Antonio Lopez picked it up. He cut inside and played a short pass to Maxi, who pushed the ball past a defender with his first touch and rifled an unstoppable diagonal drive across the face of goal and inside the far post with his second.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Interestingly, when the goal went in, the camera they're using to monitor Atletico old boy Fernando Torres in the stands showed him leaping to his feet and throwing his arms around his not unattractive lady companion before flicking Vs at the occupants of the Kop and ripping open his parka to reveal an Atletico Madrid shirt*.</p> <p>*None of the above is true. He remained completley impassive.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Steven Gerrard tries several shots from distance, none of which come within an ass's roar of troubling the goalkeeper.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> There have been no injuries or substitutions in what was a half of football played at a very high tempo, but that hasn't stopped the fourth official holding up an electronic board with a big orange '1' on it.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Half-time</strong></p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Tom Chivers credit crunch gambling update:</strong> \"Roma 1-0 Chelsea. Well, that's not ideal, is it?\" he says. \"I may be staring at a life of debasing myself for the entertainment of German businessmen in exchange for food.\" May be? You almost certainly will be, Tom, once the Fiver starts predicting prepoterous 156-75 scorelines for the remaining matches involving English teams in the Champions League group stages, just to see you lose your hard-earned cash. Still, if one of them actually comes in, you'll never have to debase yourself in front of German businessmen again.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Oh dear:</strong> Despite the efforts of in-no-way made-up reader Chad Biedle-Baker taking the trouble to explain my opening joke about the number of English speakers in the Liverpool team, this has come in from Tom, whose surname I've decided not to include in order to spare his embarrassment. \"So Jamie Carragher and Stevie Gerrard are Scousers and not native English speakers?\" he asks, probably indignantly.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Tip, tap, roll, hoof! Liverpool get the second half under way. They're playing into the Kop end in the second half, which is how they like it.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Alonso dinks the ball into the edge of the six-yard box, where Robbie Keane is waiting to swivel and volley it goalwards. Hettinga does well to get back and make a nuisance of himself by getting in the way.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> It's all going pear-shaped for Chelsea and Tom Chivers. The defending runners-up are 2-0 down against a terrible Roma side.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Robbie Keane and thousands of Koppites appeal for a penalty when Perea handles inside the six-yard box. The referee was blindsided and couldn't see the baltant handball and the linesman didn't flag to drasw his attention to it. It should have been a penalty, but Atletico Madrid get away with it.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> It's all Liverpool in this half, much as it was in the first. With the ball at his feet just outside the penalty area, Xabi Alonso moves to dink the ball over the defence, but with several of his team-mates standing in offside positions, his options are very limited. Atletico clear.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Atletico defender Perea must have signed some sort of Faustian pact with the devil before tonight's game*. He's playing out of his skin and should have conceded a penalty but didn't. Now the ball quite clearly goes out off his foot for a corner and the referee signals for a goal-kick. Liverpool are getting well and truly mugged here.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Liverpool win a free-kick for handball in the Atletico left-back position, even though the ball hit Pernia on the chest. Gerrard curls the ball into the penalty area, where Daniel Agger heads over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> \"Are the minute-by-minute reports only read by people living in the United States?\" asks Scott White. \"I'm an English guy stuck in an office in New York and it seems I'm not alone.\" Well Scott, it's hardly surprising everyone in the US is reading my report, because it's not as if there's much else of interest going on in the United States tonight.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Before Tom whose surname I won't include in a bid to spare him embarrassment writes in to set me straight, I should add that I am aware there is a US presidential election on tonight. I hope that Dubya, who has done a marvellous job as leader of the free world, gets elected for a third term, if only to see how much gas there is left in that particular explosion.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Liverpool appear to have gone close through Gerrard, Agger and Kuyt, but I'd be lying I said my head hadn't been turned, literally to the left, by the sight of Chelsea going 3-0 against Roma. Back in the match I'm supposed to be watching, Steven Gerrard has a pop from distance that fizzes wide.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Corner for Liverpool, who are dominating proceedings but continue to look vulnerable to the counter-attacks. Nothing comes of it and Atletico clear. A few minutes ago, Liverpool brought on Babel for Riera. Shortly afterwards, Maniche picked up the first yellow card of the night for a clumsy challenge.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Spellbinding play from Liverpool in general and Steven Gerrard in particular, who eviscerate the Atletico defence with a series of mesmerising one-twos, leaving Gerrard with a clear sight of goal from about 10 yards. Instead of smashing the ball padt Franco, he attempts to place it and sidefoots wide. Liverpool substitution: a most displeased Robbie Keane off, Ngog on. Atletico Madrid substitution: Sergio \"Kun\" Aguero on, Diego Forlan off. Elsewhere in this group, Marseille are beating PSV 3-0, which means that if Atletico can hold on here tonight, they'll be through to the last 16 with two matches still to play. That's a ridiculous state of affairs - the format of this tournament needs to be changed.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Great block from Jamie Carragher , who blocks a low Maniche cross that was heading straight for the waiting Kun. Maniche appealed for a penalty after the ball struck the defender's arm, but it was very much ball to arm, off his knee, so there was no foul there. </p> <p>\"Barry, I'm also stuck in an office in the US, and the fact that Chelsea are losing 3-0 is giving me almost as much pleasure as the thought of the Republicans losing tonight,\" writes Nathan Smith. \"Every single American I know over here, without exception, is voting for Obama. Who said they were stupid?\" </p> <p>You mean every single American you know over there <em>says</em> they're voting for Obama, writes your cynical minute-by-minute reporter. Whether they actually do or not remains to be seen. While I'm raining on your parade, I should probably tell you that Chelsea have pulled a goal back.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Great skill from Ngog, who does brilliantly to keep the ball from going wide while simultaneously beating a defender with a rinky-dink soft-shoe shuffle on the goal-line. From an impossible angle, he attempts to beat Leo Franco at his near post when he should have crossed for Kuyt. Corner for Liverpool, from which Agger should have scored with a header, but somehow contrived to put wide.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Agger falls under a challenge from Maniche, dislocates his finger and jogs over to the sideline where the physio yanks it back into place. Ouch!</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Liverpool have five minutes to avoid their first European defeat at Anfield since Marseille beat them 13 months ago. The last time they lost any sort of competitive match was against Barnsley in last season's FA Cup. Jamie Carragher, of all people, tries a shot from distance, which brings a smart save out of Franco. Stat attack: shots on target: Liverpool 17 - 6 Atletico Madrid. This is like Saturday's game against Spurs all over again - Liverpool are mullering their opposition but still on the verge of defeat.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> \"Time for heroes,\" says ITV commentator Peter Drury. Quite how he thinks an American science fiction television drama series created by Tim Kring, which premiered on NBC on September 25, 2006 is going to help Liverpool's cause is anyone's guess. Atletico substitution: Simao off, Liverpool old boy Luis Garcia on to warm applause.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> From deep, Gerrard curls a marvellous ball from right to left across the edge of the six-yard box. Ngog makes a fairly half-hearted attempt to get on the end of it, but seems cowed by Hettinga's challenge. Atletico clear.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>90+3min:</strong> You couldn't make it up. Steven Gerrard jumps into Pernia to contest a header, falls to the ground, twisting theatrically on his way, and is awarded a penalty.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Liverpool 1-1 Atletico Madrid (Gerrard 90+5pen)</strong> Gerrard places the ball and blasts it past Franco, who dives the wrong way. It's one of the strangest decisions I've ever seen - if anyone should have been penalised it was Gerrard, for jumping into the back of Pernia, but he ended up winning a penalty and the Atletico defender got booked. Yet another referee bottles it in front of the Kop, giving its occupants a reason to feel even more pleased with themselves than usual.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>90+7 min:</strong> Atletico show no inclination to kick off after the goal. Hettinga gets booked for complaining about the penalty, then stands with his hands on his hips nodding slowly and repeatedly at the referee as he's shown the yellow card. He is <em>oozing</em> contempt for the official. Seconds later, Aguera gets booked for booting the ball over the bar from the spot in centre-circle by way of a kick-off. Is that even a foul? I don't think so.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>90+8 min:</strong> The referee, who is mentally unravelling before our very eyes, awards a free-kick to Liverpool on the halfway line, lets them take it and then brings the game to a close. Liverpool have got away with a draw after winning a penalty they did not deserve. However, seeing as they were denied one they did deserve earlier in the game, it's probably a fair result.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>Group D:</strong> With each team having played four games in Group D, Liverpool and Atletico both have eight points. Marseille and PSV have three each after the Dutch side lost 3-0 at the hands of their French hosts. Barring some astonishing results, both Liverpool and Atletico Madrid will get through to the last 16.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>Last word tonight </strong>goes to Becky Barrett, who is very happy. \"I'm also an American following the MBM, and I actually <em>did</em> vote for Obama this morning after standing in line for 90 minutes. I only prayed for two things this week ... for Chelsea to be spanked and McCain to lose in embarassing fashion. One down, one to go ...\"</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>Actually it goes to me. </strong>Y ou <em>say</em> you pulled the lever with the big picture of Obama on it, Becky, but how do you know the vote didn't actually go to McCain? This is Amercia, we're talking about, after all. Jesus, if you live in Florida your vote could have gone anywhere.</p>",
  "<p>The Ebenezer Baptist Church in downtown Atlanta retains a special place in the history of post-war America. It was here that Martin Luther King Jr grew up listening to the sermons of his father; it was here that he made some of his most powerful speeches as pastor from 1960; and it was here that his funeral was held after he was shot on a motel balcony in Memphis on April 4, 1968, his dream as yet unrealized.</p> <p>A block away from the Ebenezer yesterday, 40 years and seven months from his assassination, an element of that dream was finally taking physical shape. From well before 6am, an hour before the polls opened, a line of about 300 people had begun to form that was dignified, quiet \u2013 somber almost \u2013 but fully aware of the huge significance of the occasion.</p> <p>Horace Kelley, 75, standing in the middle of the queue, was born in the neighbourhood and used to play softball in the church grounds with AD King, Martin Luther's younger brother.

Even that outpouring of electoral enthusiasm was deceptively muted \u2013 about 2 million voters across the state of Georgia had already cast their ballots by mail or standing in early voting lines that lasted in some cases for up to six hours, with an anticipated 3.2 million waiting to vote on the day itself.</p> <p>Election officials expect that the tally of registered Georgians who by the end of the day will have cast their votes will be as high as 90%. Some polls suggest that the race is too close to call in Georgia, a state that has voted Republican in every presidential election since it swung behind Bill Clinton in 1992.</p> <p>Most of the voters queuing up next to Ebenezer church were African-American, and universally backing Obama. \"This is history,\" said Salaam Ali, a motorbike courier, 53. \"I never thought I'd see the day when I could vote for a black president. </p> <p>\"As children we were taught to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. We were also told to believe in the idea of liberties and justice for every American. I've never seen it happen. Now it's time.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's been called the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/deadlineusa/2008/may/19/viralvideowarfare\">YouTube election</a> but it could equally go down as the Twitter election, as tens of thousands of micro bloggers report their individual experiences of voting, on the <a href=\"http://twittervotereport.com/\">Twitter vote report</a>.</p> <p>\"Never before have voters had the ability to harness so much <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bal-te.to.votertech03nov03,0,143943.story\">technology to empower themselves on Election Day</a>,\" says Baltimore Sun.</p> <p>Most say voting is going smoothly. </p> <p>\"Nice and easy plus a bake sale!\" says Greg from Valley Stream, New York.</p> <p>But problems are being reported. \"I waited before they opened for 1.5 hr and had to wait as they fixed an issue with the vote counting machine,\" says michaelruby from Berkeley, California.</p> <p>\"Voting machines down in Florida,\" says philipn with a link to a <a href=\"http://videothevote.org/video/642/\">video report of computer problems</a>. </p> <p>But this being Twitter the site itself has had its share of computer problems, as it has become over loaded with users.</p> <p>And how are they voting?

Unlike the battleground states of Ohio, Florida and others, Texas is safe and secure Republican country. John McCain, whatever happens elsewhere, can count on Texas to vote for him.</p> <p>He could also count on Joseph Englan, 26, who worked for a local services company. \"I voted Republican. It is all about the taxes. If Obama wins he will tax my company more and then they will take it out of my wages,\" said Englan. He added that his firm had held meetings to discuss the election and that the prospect of higher taxes had come. \"We had talks about it at work. The economy is what matters now. We can't afford to be raising taxes,\" he said.</p> <p>But Beaumont and Jefferson County is not typical Texas country. The city is a working port and has a large black population. It also has a growing Hispanic community. Both demographics, especially blacks, have a strong leaning towards Obama. In 2004, John Kerry narrowly won the county by 51% to 49% even as George Bush easily won Texas. Bush held Texas by a crushing 61% to Kerry's 38%.</p> <p>In black neighbourhoods in Beaumont, the turnout was slow but organizers said that reflected a huge amount of early voting.</p> <p>In the inner city around a polling station on Ewing Street, scattered groups of black voters walked through morning sunshine to get to a polling station in a local church. Among them was father and son Larry and Walter Rideaux. They had voted for Obama and smiled in the late summer heat. \"It is important to vote for him. He's the best candidate. He's intelligent and hopefully he will be able to get us out of this mess,\" said Larry Rideaux.</p> <p>His father agreed, adding that while he thought Obama was simply a better candidate than McCain, there was also a feeling of pride in casting a vote that could put the first-ever black president into the White House. \"There's no denying that. It shows us how far America has come. It shows that America is where it should be right now,\" Walter Rideaux said.</p> <p>In fact, there was such wild optimism among some black voters that a few predicted Obama could even win Texas even though such a vote swing is virtually impossible to seriously imagine.</p> <p>\"You never know. He might do it. There is a going to be a huge turnout among African Americans,\" said Larry Rideaux. That is not likely. McCain will still win Texas. But the rest of the country could be a different matter.</p>",

Officials predict that turnout could exceed 80%.</p> <p>Within 45 minutes of the ballot boxes opening at 6am, more than 70 people were waiting at a polling station at Holland's red brick Springfield high school, across a highway from a huge Wal-Mart superstore.</p> <p>Mental health counsellor Andrew Lesniewicz, 35, said he had backed Obama: \"He seems to be more in touch with reality. McCain has this mentality of wanting to fight everyone. We don't need that anymore.\"</p> <p>The working class town of Holland, on the outskirts of Toledo's industrial sprawl, was put on the political map last month when Samuel \"Joe\" Wurzelbacher, an out-of-work plumber, challenged Obama about his tax plans in a suburban street, complaining that a policy of raising levies on those earnings more than $250,000 would hit small business owners.</p> <p>Wurzelbacher, 34, quickly became a Republican hero, joining John McCain on the campaign trail, and his image adorns t-shirts with slogans such as \"no more drips in the White House\". But his antics have attracted a lukewarm reception from some of his neighbours.</p> <p>\"I feel like Joe the Plumber has a lot in common with Sarah Palin,\" said Angela Zimmann, a university teacher casting her vote in Holland. \"He's someone who is not necessarily educated for a position or experienced, but who says something that the Republicans can grab hold of.\"</p> <p>Others were more sympathetic. Shelly Lynch, a petrol station clerk who knows Wurzelbacher as a customer, said: \"I understand where he's coming from. Obama's plans are going to make things impossible for small business owners.\"</p> <p>A 39-year-old mother of three, Lynch voted Republican: \"I'm just really afraid of what will happen if Obama gets in. He's making a lot of promises I'm not sure he can uphold.\"</p> <p>A low-rise collection of strip malls and leafy streets lined with bungalows, Holland is surrounded by cornfields and is under the final approach to Toledo's regional airport. Among the biggest employers is a Jeep factory where parent company Chrysler is axing one of two shifts at the end of the year, cutting 825 jobs as a downturn in the motor industry bites.</p> <p>Mike DeShetler, who works at the Jeep plant, said he had little time for the low tax philosophy espoused by McCain and by Wurzelbacher. \"Joe the Plumber should have kept his mouth shut,\" says DeShetler, a father of three who is voting for Obama. \"We've lost all our manufacturing jobs because of free trade. The trickledown effect is not working here.\"</p> <p>DeShetler continued: \"There are no plumbers I know of who make $250,000. And if he does, he should be reinvesting it in his business and then he wouldn't be paying any more tax.\"</p> <p>Four years ago, President Bush won Ohio by a wafer-thin margin of 118,000 out of 5.6 million votes cast. Irregularities at polling stations prompted accusations by Democrats of stolen votes. This year, it is the Republicans who are complaining of invalid names on the voting register and there are fears that a close result could spark an avalanche of litigation.</p> <p>George Sarantou, a Republican councilman on Toledo's city authority, spent the morning standing outside Holland's polling station with a sign backing Barbara Sears, a candidate for Ohio's state legislature.</p> <p>\"I'm excited that we're going to have such a huge turnout of people,\" said Sarantou who insisted, with a smile, that McCain would be the president. \"I think it's going to be very close but I think John will pull it off. It's going to be an upset similar to 1948.\"</p>",

The heavy turnout was also an encouraging sign for Democrats.</p> <p>Obama had staked his chances in Virginia on driving up turnout especially among younger voters and African-Americans.</p> <p>In this section of Prince William County, people came prepared for a long wait: carrying folding chairs, cookies and cups of coffee. One woman arrived with her hair in curlers, and used the time to comb it out. Others took pictures of themselves waiting for their turn to vote.</p> <p>In a diverse crowd - young, old, African-American, Latino, Asian, and white \u2013 most people were good humoured - though a woman exiting the car park shouted out: \"Next time be here at 4am.\"</p> <p>For many there was a sense of triumph about casting their votes. People came out of the polling station, grinning, shaking their fists in victory. Some people hugged. A few cheered.</p> <p>\"I knew it was going to be record turnout, and that it was only going to get worse as the day was going on,\" said Herman Washington, 46, and a telecom worker who was among the first on-line at 4.30am. \"I think everybody is looking forward to a change.</p> <p>As an African-American, Washington said there was an extra emotional pulse to the day. \"This has been such a long struggle. Whoever envisaged we could have a black president?\" he said. \"It's very emotional and very compelling just to see this, and I keep thinking of the other people that I wish could be alive to see it as well.\"</p> <p>Celeste Norfleet, who writes Harlequin romances, the sheer act of voting was a cause for celebration. \"You have to walk out with a smile on your face,\" she said.</p> <p>Virginia is the place where slavery came to the New World with the founding of the first English colony at Jamestown in 1607. Virginia was the home of the Confederacy, and one of the last states to dismantle segregation. Until 1967, it was illegal for blacks and whites to marry.</p> <p>\"There are things in our history that have been horrible - just horrible - but now young people can see that there is hope,\" said Kanika Spruill, a teacher. \"The fact that he is African-American just gives young people hope that is not that impossible that they can do things in the future.\"</p> <p>Virginia has watched on the sidelines of presidential elections for much of the last 40 years, written off by Democrats as part of the Republican South, the state figured at the top of Obama's list this year.</p> <p>The Democrat held more rallies in the state than John McCain, and outspent the Republican several fold. Obama also held his final campaign rally in the northern portions of the state adjoining Washington, DC.</p> <p>Prince William County, which has nearly 215,000 registered voters, will be critical to Obama's hopes of taking the state.</p> <p>Suburbs like this one are in a state of flux. An older white population, that has military connections and typically votes Republicans, has given way to a wave of immigrants from Central America.</p> <p>African-Americans make up about 20% of the county's population.</p> <p>It is an area that recognises the power of the ballot box. More than 89% of registered voters in the county cast ballots in the 1992 contest between Bill Clinton and the first George Bush.</p> <p>The NAACP, anxious about long lines and delays in predominantly African-American neghbourhood, appealed for polling stations to remain open until 10pm. A judge refused the request.</p> <p>But even the old-timers had never seen lines like today's. \"I've been coming here 21 years to this place to vote and this is the first I have seen a line out the door and around the parking lot,\" said Ron Standifer, a school bus driver. \"People want to be part of history.\"</p>",

  "<p>Last week I woke up in a soccer-free US. Am I back in time? Mad? Or in a coma?</p> <p>It's been odd watching Mad Men - the show set in an ad agency in 1960 (the year I was born) - and the US version of Life On Mars, where a New York cop wakes up in 1973 (the year I spent as a festering boil farm in platform shoes and green hi-waister flares). Both shows present the past as a simultaneously recognisable but utterly foreign landscape. Not least because no one acknowledges the existence of soccer. In a series set in a US ad agency in 2008, they'd be talking about little else. Modern-day Madison Avenue is in love with proper football.</p> <p>The first thing you need to understand about leafy, lovely Chestnut Hill in suburban Philadelphia is that, apart from the hardware store, there's very little here that you'd actually need to buy. Unless you're a big fan of $8 jars of imported English piccalilli, sold by snooty staff keen to let you know that just because you know your Wensleydale from your Lancashire don't mean your limey shit don't stink, son. I can still hear my visiting sister's Yorkshire accent, in the dog boutique: \"Four pounds! For a fucking dog biscuit!\"</p> <p>At the bottom of the hill, outside a knicky-knacky antiquey sort of shop, I pick up, for a dollar, The Fourth Edition of the Junior Illustrated Encyclopedia of Sport (with an all-new chapter on \"winter ski-ing\"). I turn to the index. \"Surfing ... swimming ... tennis ...\". Wait, no soccer? Really? When was this published? 1970. Fair enough. US soccer's second wave was still only gathering steam. They're still seven years away from the national media frenzy that surrounded Pele's arrival at the New York Cosmos.</p> <p>Since then of course, all the school visits and free soccer balls handed out by the players of the North American Soccer League have borne fruit a hundred thousand fold. A Martian visiting the US for the first time would think soccer has been around forever and is hardwired into the American soul. And the idea that you could produce a soccer-free sports dictionary for American kids in 2008 is laughable.</p> <p>As we walk up the hill we see kids and mums and dads in Milan, Roma, Arsenal, Chelsea, Scotland, Brazil and Manchester United shirts - and this in the week the Phillies made the World Series. In Starbucks a ginger toddler in a Wayne Rooney England shirt is pressing his freckled nose up against the door, while at the counter muddy and still glowing schoolgirl soccer players argue about whether the game they've just played would burn of all the calories in a mocha frappuccino with whipped cream.</p> <p>A few streets to the east, on the soccer pitch behind the old water tower, two teams of girls' Under-13s are going at it hammer and tongs. One of the girls is our neighbour. Six months ago her sole interests were Harry Potter, schoolwork and the trumpet. Sport was for losers. Now she's hooked. Both teams are split almost exactly 50-50 between black kids and white kids which - given soccer's suburban, middle-class and white image, and how viciously segregated most of Philadelphia is - comes as a pleasant surprise.</p> <p>At the top of Chestnut Hill is Borders books, home to a sports section where the relatively small (but growing) soccer shelf is testament to America's continuing confusion about just how far the game has colonised the American psyche. Americans might play the game in their ever-increasing millions, they might even watch it in ever bigger numbers, soccer might well have replaced all other sports as the default cultural reference point in most popular culture, and the soccer shirt might well be on the way to replacing all other forms of sports leisure wear. But do people want to read about it?</p> <p>And then, of course, there's still the lingering suspicion that soccer is somehow not part of the \"real America\". That's a phrase we've heard a lot this past few weeks, from the prim, smirking, well-lipsticked lips of Republican attack dogs such as Sarah Palin and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" vbw4pdxvsog\"\" title=\"\">Michelle Bachman</a>.</p> <p>The Republicans are at a loss. They keep punching the \"real America\", \"small town\", \"psst, he's black\" buttons but nothing happens. Because real America has moved on. They sip lattes on Main Street. They like to think they're colour-blind. And godamn it they've been chowing down on arugla in the Midwest for decades (only they called it \"rocket\", who knew?). And, of course, their kids all play soccer.</p> <p>The guys in Mad Men, trapped in 1960, would never have used soccer in an advert. Modern-day Madison Avenue uses little else. You need a sport that's sharp, sexy, forward looking, futuristic, hip, happening and now? It's a total no-brainer. It's the Obama of sports.</p> <p>And so, after a hard day's picking stuff up and shouting \"how much!?\" and pontificating about the sport/culture/politics interface, I finally get to relax in the Borders caf\u00e9 with a metrosexual posh coffee and a copy of GQ. And there, on pages 44 and 45 is an advert for Citicard, the text of which is as follows: \"My son Jason came into this world kicking. My wife said he'd been kicking long before he was born. And growing up he kicked everything. Balls in the house. The tires on the truck. His little sister. The boy just wanted to kick.\"</p> <p>Yeah, I know what you're thinking. The future has arrived. Here at last is an American born not picking things up and throwing them but kicking them. Here at last is the American Pele: the destroyer of European and South American soccer hegemony. Buy him some boots and a soccer ball. The entire world is his oyster. The advert continues: \"So we bought cleats, helmet, shoulder pads\u2026\" and there in the accompanying photograph is a set of gridiron goalposts placed in the middle of a real American cornfield.</p> <p>I emailed the advertising agency responsible for the advert, trying to find out if they're trapped in a bizarre time warp where good ole Ronnie Reagan is president forever and hackneyed retro imagery like gridiron goalposts set in a corn field can still sell credit cards to Americans.</p> <p>As yet, they've failed to reply. Presumably because they don't have email in 1983.</p>",
  "<p>Kenyan perceptions of Barack Obama differ subtly on ethnic lines but his election might help unite the nation</p> <p>If Obama was born and raised in Kenya, he would have little chance of being elected president because of the accident of his birth.</p> <p>His father was a member of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luo_(family_of_ethnic_groups)\">Luo</a> tribe, one of the nation's largest but also most oppressed. It is no accident that while Obama's candidature has drawn huge excitement in the whole of Kenya, the depth of feeling runs infinitely deeper in the west of the country where the Luo live.</p> <p>For them, it is a redemptive moment: Locked out of leadership at home for so long, a son of theirs seems set to ascend to high office in the most powerful nation in the land.</p> <p>Yet Obama's election could also prove a wonderful opportunity for Kenya and other countries in the region. It could offer them a chance to debate their troubled history of ethnic division and the lessons people here can take from the Democratic candidate's evident success in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/us/politics/03caucus.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">triumphing over the contours of identity politics</a>.</p> <p>It could also yield an opportunity to debate the years of opportunistic, divide-and-rule policies by the elite that have laid the ground for vicious ethnic suspicion that is played out not only in the occasional outbreaks of fighting but in everyday decisions that people make: From their choice of brides, to their favourite drinking joints to the identity of the employee to receive a promotion.</p> <p>In Kenya's case, the story goes back to the years of the struggle for independence from British rule in the first half of the last century. The British had tried to isolate the Mau Mau freedom fighters, who were predominantly from the Kikuyu tribe \u2013 Kenya's largest \u2013 with a policy of divide and rule based on ethnicity.</p> <p>But at independence, there was broad unity among the various communities: Indeed, the main Luo leader Jaramogi Odinga declined an offer by the British to take office and insisted that they should release the most senior pre-independence figure Jomo Kenyatta (a Kikuyu) who then went on to be the nation's first president.</p> <p>It is Kenya's singular tragedy that the leaders who came to power in 1963 with broad national support then set off on a vicious round of infighting along ethnic lines and soon fell out bitterly.</p> <p>There were shades of ideological division, with Kenyatta aligning himself with the west while Odinga leaned east.</p> <p>But as Koigi Wamwere has chronicled in his study of the subject, Negative Ethnicity: from Bias to Genocide, the principal differences were ethnic.</p> <p>Within a few short years of helping Kenyatta ascend to power, Jaramogi Odinga and other Luo leaders such as Achieng' Oneko were fired from their positions and either placed under house arrest or thrown into detention. </p> <p>Society inevitably became seriously polarised as Barack Obama Sr discovered when he returned from Harvard looking forward to a career in government and discovered he could not get the promotions he deserved because he happened to be Luo.</p> <p>\"He would tell people that tribalism was going to ruin the country and that unqualified men were taking the best jobs,\" Auma Obama, the US senator's half sister, told him when he was writing his autobiography, Dreams From My Father.</p> <p>\"When he was passed up for a promotion, he complained loudly. 'How can you be my senior and yet I am teaching you how to do your job properly?'\"</p> <p>That stance led to his demotion and might explain his descent into alcoholism that saw him die in a road crash in the prime of his life.</p> <p>The divisions planted by the nation's founding fathers largely persist to. The last election was contested between Barack Obama Sr's former departmental boss in a government ministry Mwai Kibaki (a Kikuyu) and the son of Jaramogi, Raila Odinga (a Luo).</p> <p>The disputed outcome of the election, with most other ethnic communities insisting that the Kikuyu incumbent had managed to stay in powerful through electoral intrigue, mostly accounted for the terrible outbreak of violence in January through February this year.</p> <p>Yet as I have travelled through the country covering Kenyans' reaction to Obama's quest for the presidency, I have noticed a stark difference between the attitudes of the youth to the goings-on in America and older folk.</p> <p>You can certainly detect shades of division among people born before independence, with responses to questions on Obama largely betraying the ethnicity of the interviewee \u2013 unbridled ethnic pride in some cases, tepid support in some others.</p> <p>Among younger Kenyans, however, you cannot tell whether one is Luo, Kikuyu or any other tribe: The excitement over Obama's achievements cut across the board.</p> <p>I also encountered glimpses of that major bulwark against disintegration of the state \u2013 Kenya's well-educated, well-informed middle class \u2013 when I was tasked by an editor with the job of looking for a supporter of John McCain. I was pleasantly surprised to come across a high school teacher named Emily Cherono (who is neither Luo nor Kikuyu) but who offered the sort of brilliantly detailed case for her support for Republicans because she is a cultural conservative that you would expect from a veteran American pol.</p> <p>In the end, most Kenyans' best hope is that if the opinion polls hold true and Barack Obama is elected president, at least he can prove to millions of Africans that it is the content of one's character rather than their tribe that should count in choosing a leader.</p>",
  "<p>It's interesting to look at some of these margins on <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/\">fivethirtyeight</a> in some of the deep-red states. McCain leads in: Alabama, 23.8%; Idaho, 23%; Kansas, 16.6%; Nebraska, 21.1%; Oklahoma, 27.7%; Utah, 24.4%. States I haven't listed here aren't quite so ridiculous -- Texas and South Carolina and Louisiana and Kentucky so on are at least under 15%.</p> <p>It's a little early for schadenfreude, so I won't go there yet. But it really is interesting that some places can be so immune to, well, let's just call them historical trends. Each state really is its own little culture. Idaho is very nearly surrounded by states where Obama is going to romp or come close. But Obama voters there are some of the loneliest people in the country. Strange.</p> <p>Needless to say, the state (which I've never visited) sorta gives me the heebie-jeebies, starting with the infamous <a href=\"http://www.rrccdoc.org/images/aboutus/community/brstadium_edited.jpg\">Smurf Turf</a>.<br></p>",
  "<p>Not even Joe the Plumber, it seems, is offering much hope for John McCain.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/nov/04/joe-plumber-says-mccains-chances-slim/\">Asked by a radio presenter</a> if it would be \"tough\" for McCain to pull off a victory, the unemployed plumber replied: </p> <p>\"Most definitely.\"</p> <p>The <strong>Washington Times</strong> repeats its <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/nov/04/the-times-endorses/\">plea for voters</a> to back McCain due to his position \"on issues that touch all Americans - from abortion and judicial nominations to taxes and spending and from gun rights and the power of labour unions to the ongoing war on terror\".</p> <p>So too, in the key state of Ohio, does the <strong>Columbus Dispatch</strong>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/editorials/stories/2008/10/19/bikepath2.ART_ART_10-19-08_G4_GUBKEGH.html \">Dispatch endorses</a> Republican senator John McCain, whose experience, service and sacrifice for his country make him more qualified to lead the nation.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But the conservative New York Times columnist, <strong>William Kristol</strong>, is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/opinion/03kristol.html?bl&amp;ex=1225947600&amp;en=619f33f7ae064dcc&amp;ei=5087%0A\">preparing for defeat</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"Barack Obama will probably win the 2008 presidential election.

  "<p><strong>Catterick goes ahead</strong></p> <p>Catterick has survived an early morning inspection and racing goes ahead. There is also action from Southwell and, most importantly, Exeter, where they're running the race formerly known as the Haldon Gold Cup, now sponsored by William Hill.</p> <p>Tips follow shortly.</p> <p><strong>1.30pm Mahogany looks solid</strong></p> <p>No one wants to be the guy who moans about how things used to be but I find myself today longing for simpler times when the betting market was a lot less sophisticated. I still like <strong>Mahogany Blaze (2.40) </strong>for today's William Hill Gold Cup at Exeter but it's a pain that he's only 3-1 to beat the favourite Twist Magic and a useful supporting cast. Ten or 15 years ago, he'd have been 11-2 easily.</p> <p>Twist Magic is running in his first handicap and, on a mark of 170, has a lot to prove. In the last decade, only Azertyuiop (174) has won off a mark that high, and he was a champion two-miler. Twist Magic won the Tingle Creek with authority last year but has thrown in a couple of really disappointing runs since. Arguably, there were reasons for those efforts that don't apply here but he's too short at around 5-2.</p> <p>Mahogany Blaze comes from the Nigel Twiston-Davies yard that is always firing on all cylinders at this time of year, so he'll be hard fit for this reappearance. A course winner over hurdles, he kept on improving through his novice chasing season and beat Oslot at Cheltenham in April. That horse, from the same Paul Nicholls yard as Twist Magic, has since won the Galway Plate off 143, looking as though he had a stone in hand. Mahogany Blaze runs off 143 here.</p> <p>There are others with a chance, though I tend to put a line through the likable Ashley Brook, who always has a following but has been a terrible underachiever for the last three years.</p> <p><strong>Ibberton (3.40)</strong> rather lost his form last season, his first over fences, but showed plenty of ability with a November success over three miles at Chepstow. The better for his reappearance second over today's course and distance, he should go close at around 12-1.</p> <p>Keith Goldsworthy's yard is quite literally flying at the moment, with four winners from their last eight runners, and <strong>Cresswell Willow (4.10)</strong> could add to the tally. It's always a risk backing a horse after a one-year layoff but the stable form leads me to believe she'll be fit to do herself justice.</p> <p>More of a concern is that she's fallen at the last when leading in two of her last three outings - if she's leading on the run to the last this time, hold your breath!</p> <p><strong>2.10pm Dean McKeown rides again</strong></p> <p>Despite having been banned for four years for corruption, Dean McKeown is still able to ride because he can appeal the guilty verdict passed by the British Horseracing Authority. McKeown must appeal within seven days of the publication of the BHA's reasons for banning him for that long. Incredibly, almost a fortnight after the verdict, the BHA have yet to publish those reasons.</p> <p>The entirely predictable outcome is that another of McKeown's rides has provoked angry controversy amongst punters (see Betfair's internet chatroom for evidence of same). Riding a horse called, oddly enough, Rascal In The Mix in the 1.30 at Southwell, McKeown settled at the back before making late progress into a never-nearer fifth.</p> <p>The stewards are holding an inquiry but, whatever the outcome, it is clearly a mistake to be letting McKeown ride pending his appeal. His critics will say there is now no sanction to deter him from breaking the rules, as he already faces a lengthy ban that will effectively end his career. McKeown will no doubt point out that Rascal In The Mix had never raced before and could not be ridden as vigorously as a more experienced animal. He will say that he is being victimised by the stewards and the BHA, and libelled by those angry punters. Whoever you believe, every one of McKeown's rides is going to be the subject of endless and cynical scrutiny until the appeal process is resolved - the BHA are exposing the sport to any amount of negative publicity by allowing this to drag on.</p> <p><strong>3pm Ashley Brook back on song, it seems</strong></p> <p>Twist Magic went out like a light at the top of the straight and, with Mahogony Blaze cruising along behind the longtime leader Ashley Brook, things were looking bright for Talking Horses. Alas, Ashley Brook just kept on going, looking like anything but an injury-prone 10-year-old who hadn't run since February. Trainer Kevin Bishop said: \"We couldn't put our finger on what was wrong last year but he probably had some sort of a virus.\" That was the chestnut's first win over fences since he beat War Of Attrition by 16 lengths in a novice chase at the 2005 Grand National meeting.</p> <p><strong>4pm Dean McKeown rides no more</strong></p> <p>The BHA have just announced that his licence has been suspended with immediate effect.</p> <p><strong>7.30pm Roundup</strong></p> <p>Ibberton slogged his way into third of 18 at 9-1, though he never looked like winning. He could do with even more of a test of stamina than 3m on soft ground round here can provide.</p> <p>Cresswell Willow started at 11-1 but may well have hung on for a place if she hadn't hit the deck, again, at the third-last. She was a big drifter pre-race and I would guess she'll come on for this.</p> <p><strong>7.40pm Bit of politics</strong></p> <p>I absolutely loathe the fact that betting is allowed on something so important as a general election. However, a significant percentage of the votes have now been cast in America, so some people presumably have a pretty good idea of the way things are heading and you would expect to see that reflected in the betting markets. On Betfair, Barack Obama is now 1-20 to be the next president of the USA, having been 1-12 with the bookies this morning. Senator McCain's team may already be working on that gracious resignation speech.</p>",
  "<p>For his long march on the White House to succeed, John McCain has one remaining hope. Though \"hope\" is probably not the best word for it, since Barack Obama has invested so much importance in the term. McCain's hope is really an anti-hope, a gag reflex \u2013 that nervous, gnawing sense that <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/22/mccain.blitzer/\">something is about to go horribly wrong</a>.</p> <p>McCain knows that Obama has about every advantage that a candidate could, well, hope for: polling leads both nationally and in battleground states, elite opinion in his back pocket, a <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081103/ap_on_el_pr/campaign_rdp\">get-out-the-vote machine</a> that rivals Karl Rove's operation that put George Bush back in the White House in 2004.</p> <p>So the Republican senator has <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13920.html\">placed one last wager</a> at the electoral <a href=\"http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/07/john_mccain_gambling_addict.php\">craps table</a> of American democracy. The candidate for the party that speaks for the faith-based community has improbably bet all his remaining political capital on doubt.</p> <p>That has caused McCain to say some things that he clearly would rather not say, and to allow his subordinates to carry out the sort of scorched-earth tactics that he usually tries to rise above. Leading up to the third presidential debate, McCain let Sarah Palin accuse Obama of \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/05/usa.uselections2008\">palling around with terrorists</a>\". Then, when asked about Palin's accusation, McCain disingenuously <a href=\"http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/president/debates/transcripts/third-presidential-debate.html\">claimed</a> to not \"care about an old washed up terrorist\", ie, the former Weather Underground founder and friend of Obama Bill Ayers. He then suggested that Americans might want to care a great deal about Ayers: \"As senator Clinton said with her debates with [Obama], we need to know the full extent of that relationship.\"</p> <p>McCain also <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=6049529&amp;page=1\">said</a> that voters \"need to know the full extent of Senator Obama's relationship with Acorn, [an organisation that] is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy.\"</p> <p>None of this was artfully presented or forcefully delivered. Many McCain supporters complained about his lack of passion at the time. Surely he could have done more to make the criticism stick to Obama. But the criticism may have missed the point by a country mile.</p> <p>The point is that he brought it up at all. It's possible McCain wasn't trying for a flashy coup de grace, but was looking instead to do two things. One, cut Obama in a way that would produce a slow bleed until election day. Two, legitimise many of the criticisms of the Democratic nominee and let subordinates and freelancers deliver more cuts.</p> <p>A lot of high-minded critics have complained about McCain's tactics, but it's hard to see what else he could have done that would have put him within striking distance at this point. McCain had so many things working against him this year that he had to find some way of using that to his advantage.</p> <p>Now, McCain is playing an interesting role that is a mix of underdog and attack dog. On nearly every front, the McCain team has tried to sow doubt and discord \u2013 about Obama's leftish policies, about the spectre of massive vote fraud, about Obama's connections to fringe figures such as Ayers and his former pastor Jeremiah Wright and organisations such as Acorn and about Obama's general fitness for the office of the president.</p> <p>Whenever critics wonder whether they should \"go there\", the McCain team has uttered words to the effect of: \"Why not?\" Palin recently complained that if the press could write their doubt-raising efforts off as mere \"negative campaigning\", it would <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/10/palin-fears-med.html\">seriously imperil the first amendment</a> of the US constitution.</p> <p>Again, that's not strictly true, but it adds to the sort of worries that the Republican candidate is doing his damndest to encourage. <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-11-02-mccain_N.htm\">McCain wants voters to be seriously unsettled</a> as they go into the voting booths Tuesday, so that they won't settle on Obama.</p>",
  "<p>A poster campaign featuring Barack Obama as a white man and John McCain as a black man has been unveiled on the eve of the US presidential election to get voters to focus on policies and not race.</p> <p>The ad campaign, developed by the New York office of ad agency Grey, a subsidiary of Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP, will run on posters in New York as well as in newspapers and online.</p> <p>Dubbed \"Obamccain\" by Grey, the ad runs with the strapline \"Let the issues be the issue\".</p> <p>Most of the advertising space given over to the campaign was provided free of charge by media owners and Grey paid to develop the poster from its own funds.</p> <p>Grey has launched the ad campaign in the 11th hour of the hotly-contested US presidential race, with Americans heading to the polls today.</p> <p>Obama, the Democrat presidential candidate, is bidding to become the first black president of the US; while McCain is seeking to extend the Republican party's tenure in White House by another four years.</p> <p>\"This is a non-partisan image. We wanted to address the race issue straight on. And it cuts both ways,\" said Tor Myhren, the chief creative officer of Grey New York.</p> <p>\"If you're hopping on either candidate's bandwagon solely due to the colour of their skin, you're voting for the wrong reasons.\"</p> <p>The poster has rapidly become a collector's items with many disappearing as fast as they are put up.</p> <p>Grey said that the image may be used by high schools in New York, Denver and \"other cities around the US\" as part of an election lesson plan and as a \"discussion piece\". </p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>China and Taiwan moved closer to overcoming six decades of hostilities today, as they signed deals drastically expanding direct flights and allowing shipping links across the Formosa strait.</p> <p>The agreement follows a dramatic thaw in relations over the last six months, since the election of Taiwan's new president, Ma Ying-jeou. The island broke away from the mainland at the end of the civil war in 1949.</p> <p>Beijing and Taipei have agreed to set aside contentious political issues to work on improving economic links - important to both at a time of worldwide gloom.</p> <p>Thousands of demonstrators led by the opposition Democratic People's party spent a night on the streets of central Taipei, using loudspeakers to condemn the visit of Chen Yunlin - the most senior Chinese official to visit the island in 60 years - and accuse Ma of selling out to Beijing.</p> <p>But today Chen enjoyed a warmer welcome as he sipped champagne with his Taiwanese counterpart, Chiang Pin-kung. The two men posed for photographers holding a piece of framed calligraphy reading: \"Peaceful negotiation creates a win-win situation.\"</p> <p>Chiang told reporters that direct shipping would shave 16 hours and up to 30% in costs off voyages, helping Taiwan to become an Asian transport hub and explore the mainland market.</p> <p>This summer saw the first regular direct flights across the 100-mile strait since the civil war, but Andrew Yang, the secretary general of the Chinese Council for Advanced Policy Studies think tank in Taipei, said today's deal, which also tripled the number of flights, was a major advance on that symbolic change.</p> <p>\"Now it's more substantial,\" he said. \"Direct cargo links also means Taiwan's hi-tech products can be directly shipped to the mainland, which should boost the confidence of local people ... Hopefully more robust cross-Straits economic ties will help to stabilize the economic situation.\"</p> <p>Yang said it was too early to judge how Ma's slumping poll ratings would be affected by the agreement.</p> <p>The agreement also includes measures for greater cooperation on food safety, enabling faster recalls of substandard products and better exchange of information.</p> <p>The two sides agreed to hold talks every six months and focus on closer financial ties in the next round of discussions. Taiwan's negotiator suggested joint criminal law enforcement could also be on the agenda.</p> <p>Taiwan has enjoyed effective independence since the end of the civil war in 1949, but Beijing has warned it would take military action if the island attempts to formalise its status.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Andy B and Neil C. <br> <strong>The background:</strong> Deadfisch are an odd fisch. There's nothing strange about the self-styled music/art project's timing: they've chosen today as the historic date for the release of their double A-side single Hey Mister President/God Bless America, but we're not sure what it is they're trying to tell us about the election or the nation on the brink of major, seismic change. <br> They're not American, so they sing about the place with wry dispassion and humorous concern. No, they're quintessential Brit eccentrics - God Bless America features, on banjo and fiddle, one Wild Willy Barrett, who briefly achieved notoriety, as the bearded caveman half of Otway and Barrett, with that weird one-off punk-era hit, Really Free. The track also features the Sheffield Socialist Choir on backing vocals, although they sound like they're from South Carolina not South Yorkshire, possibly due to the fact that the song includes soundbites from that bloke Oliver Stone has just made a biopic about (George W something) while the music resembles the Duelling Banjos theme from the movie Deliverance meets Cotton Eye Joe by Rednex, that terminally infectious novelty country'n'disco hoedown from the mid-90s.  They're big on cameos and guest stints (\"world-famous\" opera singer Ursula Ferri appears - either in a real sense or in sampled form, we can't tell - on a track of theirs called Das Lied Von Der Erde), but Deadfisch are a duo. The brains of the operation is Andy B, formerly an Art Director at Saatchi's who has exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery - fans of his work include Billy Bragg, who played a Deadfisch-designed guitar on the Southbank last year. Then there's Neil C, who used to be in Marillion, on keyboards.  The bit about them being a \"music/art project\" is a relief \u2013 it lends meaning and playful purpose to what otherwise would be rock ordinaire with the occasional sampled voice or electronic effect. So they're auctioning off a Deadfisch-designed surfboard for the charity Military Families Against War, and they're about to issue an anti-war concept album titled Collateral Damage which apparently \"encompasses an eclectic range of styles from club to rock to opera and follows the story of one young soldier\".  Which is all well and good. We just wish they'd used the opportunity to make their songs as intriguing as their extracurricular ventures and as powerful as the themes they explore in their music, which is mostly an unfocused, bombastic mess. Hey Mister President is the sort of blue-collar anthem a US President might use as a campaign rally rabble-rouser and hold up as an example of middle-American vigour, a Springsteen or Mellencamp of a pedal-to-the-metal freeway stomper. God Bless America is like a C&amp;W version of Two Tribes, with air-raid sirens, gunfire, pounding beats and a gently pummelling bassline, with Dubya quotes over the artillery, a screechy guitar solo and crowd roars, plus a burst of reggae in the middle before it goes all dosey-do again. Maybe the muddled mix is a deliberate attempt to mirror the mess of the Bush administration.  They've got one other track, Extraordinary Rendition, which sounds like a pub full of revellers wailing drunkenly along with a ramshackle version of the Star Spangled Banner (plus some Monty Python daft-old-lady voices at the end). What Deadfisch are commenting on or protesting about remains unclear, and as with the Oliver Stone movie it's a bit like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted, but there is something vaguely righteous about the project, even if it does lack radical intent/content.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"The politics are handled with humour; no po-faces were present.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> Why so (mildly) caustic and (seemingly) critical? Obama is coming! <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Put a dampener on proceedings. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Be played on Bush's iPod as he packs and leaves the White House. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Hey Mister President/God Bless America is available today from iTunes, with the album Collateral Damage to follow.<br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, Mothers of Invention, Rednex, Medicine Head. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/deadfisch\">www.myspace.com/deadfisch</a> </p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Jay Jay Pistolet</p>",
  "<p>Tehran taxi drivers might not know where the US embassy used to be, especially if they weren't around when the Islamic Revolution took place in 1979. But ask for the \"nest of spies\" and they will head as fast as the permanently gridlocked traffic allows to Taleghani Avenue, where slogans and murals on a long brick wall proclaim a historic victory over \"global arrogance\".</p> <p>Americans remember the compound as the scene where their diplomats were held hostage for 444 days until finally being freed in January 1981 as a gesture to Ronald Reagan, the incoming Republican president. </p> <p>Reagan's predecessor, Jimmy Carter - the Democrat who had urged Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to make concessions to the opposition - ended his term with another stinging humiliation from the man who removed Pahlavi from the Peacock Throne, Ayatollah Khomeini.</p> <p>It was a coincidence that this year's anniversary of the storming of the embassy yesterday fell so close to the American presidential election, providing a vivid and timely reminder of the tortured relationship between the US and Iran .</p> <p>The speeches to mark the anniversary from the podium outside what was once called Roosevelt gate were predictably fiery. Familiar slogans - \"Death to America\" \"Death to Israel\" and \"Death to Zionism\" - were chanted in Farsi, Arabic and finally English to ensure maximum impact. Young Basij volunteers in camouflage gear and green Imam Hussein headbands sang sweetly of sacrifice and martyrdom. War veterans in wheelchairs were given place of honour on carpets rolled out in the street.</p> <p>Iranians say that the turnout at such set-piece official events is in decline and only kept up by bussing in soldiers, militiamen and children who are given the day off school to carry placards, wave banners, and burn the odd flag. The embassy rally has the ritualistic, symbolic quality of something that is done because it has been done for years, not because it means that much any more.</p> <p>Massoud, a 15-year-old Tehran schoolboy, posed happily with a \"Death to the USA\" poster, oblivious to the irony of his Colorado Rockies sweatshirt, jeans and trainers. \"I hate the US government, not the people,\" he explained. \"And especially not those who love justice and don't want to dominate the world.\"</p> <p>Only the teenage girls, some in black chadors though many with headscarves draped loosely over carefully-arranged hair, looked any different from their American counterparts.</p> <p>\"If the US embassy re-opened and started issuing visas to Iranians again, a lot of these people would be queuing up to get one,\" quipped Hussein, a teacher and trenchant critic of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. </p> <p>\"Many of my friends are thinking of leaving the country if they can because they are so unhappy with the way the government is running things.\"</p> <p>Officially, there is little interest here in the outcome of the US election. Ayatollah Khamenei, the supreme leader, has spoken of \"deep-seated differences\" between the two countries, apparently seeking to squash speculation about any sudden change, or at least ensuring that he will control it if there is. </p> <p>\"Obama and McCain have differences over tactics, not strategy,\" argued Hamidreza Taraghi of the Islamic Coalition party, an Ahmadinejad ally. \"Anyway they are both sponsored by the Zionists so we can't expect they won't be influenced by them.\"</p> <p>Jamal, a middle-aged driver, wanted to see John McCain in the White House because \"he will attack Iran and set us free\". Yet he also wants Iran to develop nuclear weapons (the government insists, to widespread scepticism abroad, that its only motive in developing nuclear technology is to generate power). \"We are threatened by the US and Israel. If the Jews have the atomic bomb, why shouldn't we?\"</p> <p>Voices in the reformist camp are more nuanced about the prospects of an Obama win. Hossein Adeli, head of the Ravand Foundation, the country's only non-official NGO, predicts that positive gestures from Washington will be met by greater Iranian cooperation over Iraq and Afghanistan. \"If Obama wants to change the image of America in the world Iran is one area were he can demonstrate it,\" he said. \"It would give him the edge over his predecessors.\"</p> <p>With so much at stake it is natural that the world is focused on the drama of the race for the White House. But, the Iranian reformists suggest, it may be that their own presidential election next June will prove almost as crucial. </p> <p>Ahmadinejad's rhetoric about Israel and the Holocaust - the latter at least an embarrassment to many here - will likely be a serious barrier to any rapprochement. But if Obama makes it to the Oval Office he could expect to find an easier interlocutor in Mohamed Khatemi, the former president who oversaw a partial thaw in US-Iranian relations until George Bush's \"axis of evil\" speech and the subsequent focus on Iran's nuclear ambitions. Reformists hope Khatemi will stand again, pointing to reliable polling that shows his popularity ratings more than double those of Ahmadinejad.</p> <p>But it is highly uncertain whether he will stand, and unlikely that he or any other reformist could actually win.</p> <p>\"For Iranians, the election in the US is not important,\" said Mohammed Ali Abtahi, a cleric and former vice-president under Khatemi. \"What is important is what happens here.\"</p> <p>Farnaz, a 22-year-old animator, was born years after the drama of Tehran's \"nest of spies\" and barely glances at the angry slogans on Taleghani Avenue. Farnaz prefers Obama to McCain or Bush. But for her, too, Iran's biggest problems lie closer to home - and their solution in the hands of her compatriots. \"If Ahmadinejad goes and is replaced by someone else,\" she smiled, \"then I'm sure things can get better here.\"</p>",

  "<p>This <a href=\"http://www.openleft.com/showDiary.do;jsessionid=560025E180FE2059EED514886D2F1345?diaryId=9663\">little chart</a> shows that presidential polling in 2004 was the most accurate of the last quarter century.</p> <p>In fact polling has since 1980 gotten progressively more accurate each election with the exception of 1996, when polls famously over-predicted Clinton's margin of victory over Dole. This will lead some to wonder whether the same thing is happening now. Perhaps. But I doubt it. Clinton was the incumbent president, which makes for a completely different psychology. I think.</p> <p>My sense is that things will be a little tighter than the polls suggest, but only a little -- two or three points nationwide, meaning a 4.5% to 5.5% Obama win rather than the current 7.5-ish. This would prevent Obama from winning some states but shouldn't interfere with the quest for 270 unless things get really weird out there.</p> <p>On the other hand if this Obama ground game really blows the gates off things, then I guess he could win North Carolina, Missouri etc and turn this into a blowout. That's one of the things I'm most intent on watching for today and tonight. Every anecdotal thing you read -- from Kos diarists, say -- sounds pretty formidable. We'll see.<br></p>",

  "<p>Josh appears to be <a href=\"http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/242436.php\">relatively sanguine</a> that the Obama team is on top of the \"voter fraud\" and voter suppression situations:</p> <blockquote> <p>...Our own reporting has shown that in almost every case judges have shot down the GOP suppression gambits in the courts. Again and again, the courts have just shut them down. </p> <p>Don't get me wrong. I don't want to be pollyannish. This is an issue where even if the glass is 95% full -- it's not nearly enough. It's all about the 5% empty. But there's some room for optimism, especially on how rough a time the vote suppression crew has had in the courts this cycle. </p> </blockquote> <p>Hope that's right. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Greg Palast offers <a href=\"http://www.gregpalast.com/how-mccain-could-win/\">a more pessimistic take</a>.

  "<p>If I were the BBC's director general, I would have two pictures pinned up above my desk. On the left would be one of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/lesleydouglas\">Lesley Douglas</a>, former Radio 2 controller and the only person who genuinely has been hurt by the recent row. And on the right, and as it were on the other side of the coin, would be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/strictlycomedancing/contestants/john_sergeant.shtml\">John Sergeant</a>, the cheerful yet enigmatic survivor of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/strictlycomedancing \">Strictly Come Dancing</a>, whose hilariously undeserved democratic success is beginning, slowly but surely, to exasperate the judges.</p> <p>Arlene Phillips is <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/strictly_come_dancing/article1888318.ece\">reportedly highly irritated</a> by Sergeant staying on the show and Craig Revel-Horwood rather testily remarked on air last week that he hoped the voting public would \"pay attention to the judges\". Should they? </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/jonathan-ross\">As for the Ross/Brand affair</a> itself, there can hardly be anything else to add right now regarding what my colleague Charlie Brooker described as the \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/03/jonathan-ross-russell-brand\">gitstorm</a>\" - other than to remember how very close to real trouble Jeremy Clarkson and the Top Gear team came over Richard Hammond's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/sep/21/lifeandhealth.bbc\">near-fatal crash</a> in September 2006. Clarkson, however, had columns on News International papers. He was on their team, which effectively caused that newspaper group, and all the others, to think twice and thrice before putting their steel-toecapped boot in to his kidneys. Perhaps if Jonathan Ross had kept his film review column on the News of the World, the Sun would have wondered about buying up <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/29/russell-brand-jonathan-ross1\">the Max Clifford-ghosted outrage of Georgina Baillie</a>. Perhaps this connection with News International would have caused Fleet Street's indignation to falter short of the tipping point. </p> <p>Anyway, Russell Brand's flameout on Radio 2 and John Sergeant's onward march to glory on Strictly Come Dancing (I am thinking of his unusually military version <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=SlIasHFUrVM\">of the Paso Doble</a>) have something in common. Each shows a streak of independence in the BBC's customer base, verging on anarchy and bloody-mindedness. Who were the 30,000 people who complained about Russell Brand? Could there be an overlap with the people who ring in to vote for John Sergeant every week? Is this the silent majority speaking, the stubborn mass of middle-aged middle-Englanders who like firing a torpedo at the BBC's metropolitan youth-worshippers? </p> <p>I wonder. The big difference is this: the anti-Brand vote, however justified it may have been in moral terms, was grimly and determinedly humourless. But the pro-Sergeant vote is the opposite. It is genuinely funny, without undermining the programme. As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/nov/05/strictlycomedancingisthen\">a dyed-in-the-wool SCD fan</a>, I think Sergeant's survival is brilliant because it is, in some profound showbiz sense, entirely deserved. However hopeless he is as a dancer, Sergeant never makes a fool of himself because he is always completely assured while trotting cheerfully around the floor. </p> <p>He is absolutely immune to SCD-fever, the phenomenon of celebrity contestants on the programme starting off all relaxed and then becoming fanatically steely and gimlet-eyed in their absolute dedication to winning. Remarkably, Sergeant appears quite calm about the whole thing, and when seated on the sofa in the green room, the big \"reaction\" facial expressions that he does, affecting outrage when someone alludes to his underdog status, are pure comedy gold. </p> <p>So let's keep John Sergeant on the show - for a few more weeks, anyway.</p>",
  "<h2>First blood to Obama</h2> <p>And so here we are. In accordance with tradition, voting opened at midnight eastern time, or 5am UK time, in Dixville Notch, New Hampshire today, and closed moments later, after the village's residents had gathered to cast their ballots in the ballroom of a local hotel. They voted overwhelmingly for Obama - by 15 votes to six. </p> <p>By the time the rest of America has voted, election officials expect <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/04/uselections2008-barackobama2\">the biggest turnout in the nation's history</a> -130-140 million voters, compared with 121 million in 2004, Ewen MacAskill writes in the Guardian today, bringing this gripping and unprecedented campaign to a close at last. Obama is well ahead in all the major polls, and there seems little doubt he will gain the 270 electoral college votes required to win. The question more frequently asked is whether he'll win by a landslide.</p> <p>The Democrats also seem on track to gain seven or eight more seats in the Senate, where they already hold 51 - a victory that could make governing effectively far easier for Obama than for some of his predecessors. Whatever happens tonight, the election campaign \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/04/us/politics/04memo.html\">has rewritten the rules</a> on how to reach voters, raise money, organize supporters, manage the news media, track and mould public opinion, and wage - and withstand - political attacks,\" writes Adam Nagourney in the New York Times The day brought sadness for Obama, though, in the midst of his rising confidence. His paternal grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, who raised him from the age of 10, died of cancer in Honolulu, a day before the nation voted on her grandson's candidacy. </p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>A light day of campaigning. Obama is due in Indiana and McCain in Colorado and New Mexico before the two candidates head back to their home states to vote and await the results. McCain will follow proceedings in Phoenix and Obama in Chicago before he addresses the enormous crowd in Grant Park.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/osamabinladen\">Osama bin Laden</a>'s media secretary has been sentenced to life in prison for terrorism offences in the second war crimes trial at the US detention centre in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/guantanamo\">Guant\u00e1namo Bay</a>.</p> <p>Ali Hamza al-Bahlul, 39, from Yemen, who made propaganda videos for Bin Laden before being captured in December 2001, was found guilty by a jury of nine military officers who deliberated for just under an hour.</p> <p>He was convicted of 35 counts of conspiracy, solicitation to commit murder and providing material support for terrorism.</p> <p>Al-Bahlul told jurors he proudly volunteered to be a plane hijacker on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/september11\">September 11</a> 2001 and called America \"the head of the infidels\".</p> <p>He acknowledged joining the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/alqaida\">al-Qaida</a> terrorist network, accused the US of oppressing Muslims for 50 years and said \"we will fight any government that governs America\".</p> <p>He told jurors before being sentenced that he volunteered to be the 20th hijacker in the September 11 terrorist attacks on the US, but Bin Laden told him his role was to head al-Qaida's propaganda machine.</p> <p>\"We are the only ones on Earth who stand against you,\" al-Bahlul said. \"You have started the war against us.\"</p> <p>His lawyer, Air Force Major David Frakt, said he was not surprised by the life sentence considering the defendant's comments.</p> <p>\"I think the 20th hijacker comment pretty much sealed the deal,\" Frakt said. \"But he might have gotten life anyway.\"</p> <p>Al-Bahlul had previously called the military tribunal a \"legal farce\" and refused to mount a defence by boycotting the trial silently at the defence table. At al-Bahlul's request, his military lawyer did not speak either, declining even to answer questions from the judge.</p> <p>The lead prosecutor, Army Major Daniel Cowhig, said al-Bahlul had shown no remorse or regret.</p> <p>\"When will it be safe for this man to leave confinement? Never,\" Cowhig said.</p> <p>Al-Bahlul was not accused of participating in the September 11 attacks, but prosecutors and witnesses said he was so close to Bin Laden that he hooked up a satellite receiver for the pair to hear live radio coverage of the attacks from their base in Afghanistan's Khost province.</p> <p>Prosecutors said he acknowledged to interrogators that he was al-Qaida's media chief, made propaganda videos that inspired terrorists to attack the US, and arranged for the lead September 11 hijacker, Mohamed Atta, to swear a loyalty oath to the al-Qaida chief.</p> <p>Witnesses at his sentencing included the father of a sailor killed in the 2000 attack on the USS Cole which featured in a video the military says al-Bahlul produced to train and inspire al-Qaida terrorists in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Gary Swenchonis Sr, whose son Gary was killed in the attack, said he was devastated al-Bahlul's video had been widely available on the internet.</p> <p>\"It's pervasive,\" said Swenchonis, of Rockport, Texas. \"That's what's so bad. That's what's so wrong.\"</p> <p>Al-Bahlul, who was brought to Guant\u00e1namo in 2002, is the second prisoner to go through a war crimes trial under the special military commissions system.</p> <p>The former Bin Laden driver Salim Hamdan was convicted in August and sentenced to five and a half years in prison. He is still at Guant\u00e1namo and will have completed his sentence by January 2009 with credit for time served.</p> <p>A third prisoner, the Australian David Hicks, reached a plea agreement that sent him home to serve a nine-month prison sentence.</p> <p>The military has not yet decided where al-Bahlul will serve his sentence but for now he will be kept from the general population at Guant\u00e1namo.</p> <p>US officials have said they plan to prosecute about 80 of the 255 prisoners still held at Guant\u00e1namo, but critics of the tribunals say they doubt there will be any more trials. </p> <p>Both the Republican presidential candidate, Senator John McCain, and his Democratic counterpart, Senator Barack Obama, have said they want to close Guant\u00e1namo.</p> <p>\"I suspect that's the last of the military commissions,\" said the former Air Force colonel Morris Davis, who resigned as chief prosecutor for the trials in October 2007 after clashing with his superiors.</p>",
  "<p>As the campaign season wraps up and November 4 inches closer, one cannot help but reflect on what an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._presidential_election,_2008_timeline\">extraordinary election season</a> this has been. </p> <p>Who could have known a year ago that Barack Obama would beat Hillary Clinton to become the Democratic nominee? That a hitherto unknown governor of Alaska \u2013 a state with a population smaller than Columbus, Ohio \u2013 would become the Republican vice presidential nominee and subsequently an international phenomenon? That Obama would raise over $600m, the majority of which has come from small donations made by regular Americans? Or that a global economic downturn would rear its head and the government would agree to a $700m bail-out plan? </p> <p>If <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1855843,00.html\">John McCain loses on Tuesday</a>, I'm sure he will kick himself as he looks back at the twists and turns that his campaign has taken. Members of his own party as well as Republican strategists and analysts have already concurred that McCain's campaign for the presidency has lacked an overarching theme or message. It started off well, but has lurched from pillar to post with its weaknesses and inconsistencies. </p> <p>Whereas McCain was once considered the more solid and experienced candidate, the shocking pick of Sarah Palin for vice-president and his response to the economic crisis \u2013 matters that a seasoned politician like McCain should have been able to handle with ease \u2013 have been his undoing, now revealing a man who appears to lack integrity and good judgment, which is in sharp contrast to how he was once perceived.</p> <p>It's fair to say that both Obama and his chances of succeeding were underestimated when he entered the race for the White House. A year ago Obama's talk of \"change\" and \"hope\" were criticised for being nothing more than lofty rhetoric with little practical significance. Writing in The New Republic in October 2007, political commentator Noam Scheiber <a href=\"http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_stump/archive/2007/10/29/more-advice-for-obama.aspx\">advised</a>: \"I think Obama's changing politics theme is too ambitious.\" He then went on to say: \"Where Obama goes wrong is his choice of general-election themes. I think the 2004 approach \u2013 making the case against Bush-style Republicanism \u2013 is much better suited to the current moment than the hopeful, new-politics theme.\" As we now know, Scheiber and others who thought that way were wrong. The messages of change and hope have galvanised and enthused millions of Americans in a way that has been entirely unprecedented. Very few can fail to be impressed by the highly effective, consistent, extremely organised and impressive campaign that Obama has run in this election. </p> <p>Obama has managed to turn issues \u2013 such as race \u2013 that others believed would be his downfall into his triumph. The Jeremiah Wright controversy, for example, threatened to derail his campaign, with a <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/people2/just_8_have_favorable_opinion_of_pastor_jeremiah_wright\">March Rasmussen poll</a> saying that 56% of voters were less likely to vote for Obama because of Wright's comments. However, Obama used Reverend Wright's comments to his advantage: they allowed him to give one of the most important speeches on race relations that America has heard for a long time, raising his popularity again. It has continued to grow since. </p> <p>Before the primaries, many African Americans believed that white Americans wouldn't vote for Obama. In December 2007, Eugene Robinson of the Washington Post <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/10/AR2007121001563.html\">wrote</a>: \"[Senior black politicians and figures] have griped privately to me that this whole Obama thing is madness, that he can't possibly win and that with a known quantity such as Hillary Clinton in the race, this is no time to go chasing rainbows.\" With Obama currently poised to become America's first African American president, those people must be eating their words today. </p> <p>A January 2007 Time magazine article entitled <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1581666,00.html\">Can Obama Count On The Black Vote?</a> highlighted a lack of support for Obama among black leaders and quoted Reverend Al Sharpton as saying: \"Right now, we're hearing a lot of media razzle-dazzle \u2026 I'm not hearing a lot of meat, or a lot of content.\" This past Saturday night, the same Al Sharpton appeared on CNN <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/bestoftv/2008/11/02/dl.al.sharpton.cnn\">singing Obama's praises</a>. </p> <p>Similarly, prominent black figures and politicians \u2013 and even regular African Americans \u2013 who were originally sceptical of Obama have since done a dramatic about-turn. African American turn out on Tuesday is set to break records and is expected to have a major influence on key states such as North Carolina and Virginia.</p> <p>There have been a number of surprising events during the campaign. The Democratic party did not implode when Hillary lost to Obama in the primary. The Hillary supporters who were supposed to have flocked to McCain in droves soon turned back to Obama, especially after the appearance of Sarah Palin \u2013 who has risen from a virtual nobody to being one of the most famous women in the world and who is expected to run for president in 2012. Last week Bill Clinton and Obama <a href=\"http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world/view/386489/1/.html\">went on the campaign trail together</a>, and the party appears more unified than before. </p> <p>Once considered naive and inexperienced, Obama has emerged \u2013 strengthened by his performance during the debates and his response to the economic crisis \u2013 as the most presidential and statesman-like candidate, and he certainly is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/us/politics/03caucus.html?hp\">not trailing</a> among white working-class voters as anticipated. </p> <p>Not even the most astute of political analysts could have foreseen the events that have taken place during this presidential campaign. No matter who wins on Tuesday, this has been a momentous period. </p> <p>I started following this campaign soap-opera in earnest on September 27, 2007 when I saw Obama speak at a rally in New York. It's been a riveting journey since then. No doubt there are many lessons for politicians and strategists to learn from this campaign. The most important? Never underestimate the audacity of hope.</p>",
  "<p>Cartoonists and photo librarians are already printing their farewell selections on George W Bush, and the Guardian's G2 has been giving him one last bashing or three \u2013 though the famous US presidential transition means Dubya still has three months to serve.</p> <p>But how bad a president has he been in the larger scheme of things? Who was the worst and indeed the best of the 43 elected since that remarkable constitution (unlike the EU's wordy jargon, it can be both read and understood in 20 minutes) was painstakingly constructed at Philadelphia in 1787? </p> <p>My views of the No 1 are pretty conventional, I'm afraid. I'm an Abraham Lincoln (1861-65) man, though George Washington (1789-97), wise and unflashy founding president of the republic, commands a good case. Eight years is enough for anyone, he realised, an enduring precedent, which even Vladimir Putin had to respect (sort of).</p> <p>Up there too is the man who breached it in exceptional circumstances: Franklin D Roosevelt (1933-45). He never gets enough credit, says me, for being the greatest political figure of the 20th century, the leader who mastered both the depression and global war against fearsome enemies without resort to tyranny or barbarism.</p> <p>But we can all play this game. As with sporting heroes, great movies and much else there are people who devote huge amounts of time to \"best of'' lists, as any Google search confirms. What I call <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_United_States_Presidents \">Wikipedia University</a> confirms that my trio usually takes the top three places, with Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt \u2013 he wouldn't have cut those Wall St bankers so much slack \u2013 just behind them. That's cool with me too.</p> <p><a href=\" http://www.karemar.com/blog/top-10-united-states-presidents-all-time \">Here's another</a> I found easily, one which includes useful summaries of achievement and stirring quotes. JFK (1961-63) doesn't make the top 10, nor should he, but the compiler includes him as a \"personal favourite\". That's nice, but it's also a warning that \u2013 as with movies where recent duds often outshine enduring classics \u2013 we can all be misled by our own perspective.</p> <p>The Times \u2013 London, not New York - <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article5055404.ece\">took a crack at this one the other day</a>. A panel of Times pundits ranked all 42 (not 43 because Grover Cleveland got elected for two separate terms) with what I thought were some perverse results, especially in the back half.</p> <p>As Times posters were quick to protest, you can't put Richard Nixon (1969-74) at No 37. Yes, he was a seriously flawed man, paranoid and vengeful (a US chum says McCain would be the same), and driven from office for shocking misconduct, the only such president.</p> <p>But he was also a brilliant man who drew isolated China back into the international sphere and ended the Vietnam war. That had been messed up by Lyndon Johnson (1963-69) who makes the cut at No 12 for his domestic achievements, anti-poverty programmes, but above all the civil rights legislation, which has allowed Barack Obama to be where he is today. </p> <p>In doing so Johnson, the supreme political manipulator, admitted that the Democrats would \"lose the south for a generation\". True, though they may be about to get them back. But Johnson too was a flawed political genius for whom Bill Shakespeare would have got out his Olivetti, as he would for Nixon but few others among the 41-plus-Grover-and Grover. Most were fairly unremarkable men upon whom varying degrees of greatness were thrust.</p> <p>That's why Harry Truman (1945-53) usually comes out well. No one expected much of FDR's deputy, but he rose to the challenges he inherited. Yes, I know he dropped the atom bomb of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Did it save many Japanese as well as American lives? I have always felt so, but others disagree.</p> <p>What about the bad guys? The Times puts James Buchanan (1857-61), the Democrat who dithered and drifted towards the bloody civil war that nearly destroyed the union, as No 42, a verdict echoed by other even weightier surveys. Franklin Pierce, his predecessor (1853-57), a drunk and incompetent, was placed second worst.</p> <p>Myself, I think Rutherford Hayes (1877-81), a Republican elected after a \"hanging chads\" kind of scandal in Florida, has a lot to answer for. As part of the deal which let him win the disputed election he pulled federal troops out of the occupied south and allowed racist Jim Crow laws to be re-established for the next 80 years.</p> <p>So does Warren Harding (1921-23) who presided over a post-war boom, marred by red-baiting attacks on civil liberties and spectacular corruption. </p> <p>Ulysses S Grant (1869-77) also tolerated the \"robber baron\" era and a depression. Being a great war-winning general was not enough, though another such, Dwight Eisenhower (1953-61), comes out better: a decent man who hated war and warned against the emergence of an over-powerful military-industrial complex. </p> <p>Under a weak president like Dubya it has become one of the greatest threats to American liberties \u2013 and by extension to our own. So how is George W Bush likely to fare at the hands of history?</p> <p>As with Ronald Reagan (No 8 in the Times list) and Bill Clinton (slapped down to No 23) it's all too soon to be clear. Reagan was very likeable, and his supporters claim he \"won\" the cold war against the USSR, which first crumbled on his watch. How significant was that? We don't yet know.</p> <p>Clinton, a man of great potential, was a disappointment. Yet he presided over a successful economy, unencumbered by the huge public debt, which both Bushes helped create. The Lewinsky affair was deplorable, but some of his tormentors in Congress were exposed for hypocrisy on a far bigger scale.</p> <p>George W Bush has particular problems. History's verdict on his Iraq war depends on how the Middle East evolves over the next 20 years and beyond. If more stable and successful states emerge, their citizens healthier, wealthier and happier, then the Bushites may claim some credit. </p> <p>And vice-versa. As for the post 9/11 \"war on terror\" it was misconceived and overblown. Domestic civil liberties suffered \u2013 most conspicuously at Guant\u00e1namo Bay \u2013 taking America's \"soft power\" reputation down around the world. The courts will one day declare the policy to have been unconstitutional.</p> <p>It's Bush's domestic economic record which may push him close to the bottom of the league \u2013 where many Americans already put him, albeit prematurely. He was dominated by highly ideological officials who slashed the wrong taxes for the wrong people (rich ones), allowed a budget surplus to become a huge deficit and spent like drunken sailors. </p> <p>Worse, an unsustainable boom turned into the past year's dramatic bust. Rightwing free market theorists have been forced to nationalise banks. If that all wasn't enough there was the shameful neglect of Hurricane Katrina: another avoidable bust which destroyed much of the great American city that was New Orleans.</p> <p>So President Obama or President McCain \u2013 my caution persists until the votes are all counted - will inherit a heavy burden, with expectations on the frontrunner recklessly high. George W has been hidden throughout much of the campaign. You could almost feel sorry for him.</p> <p>But hey's this is America. So let's end as Americans try to do, on an optimistic note. Lincoln was the country's greatest president because he was a leader who combined low political cunning, the ability to master men and events, with heady rhetoric and a moral vision expressed in simple, stirring English, the language of the King James Bible, Shakespeare and the founding fathers. He saved the union \u2013 what he called 'the last, best hope of mankind\".</p> <p>If you haven't read Lincoln's <a href=\"http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg.htm\">Gettysburg Address lately, here it is</a>, delivered in 1863 on the site of a bloody, recent battlefield where the confederacy's last attempt to split the union north of Washington. Just 272 words, mocked (by the London Times!) as inadequate at the time, it's what we'd now call a pretty good Victorian soundbite. </p> <p>I like to think that Honest Abe, up there on his cloud, will be watching the count tonight, along with the countless million ghosts of the Atlantic slave trade. Who'd have thought it, eh?</p>",
  "<p>Morgan Stanley strategist Teun Draaisma - who called the bear market correctly - has now turned into a full out bull.</p> <p>In a note this morning, he advises clients to consider buying equities despite what is looking like a prolonged recession. He said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Despite the bad fundamental outlook, prudent investors should not be short equities, and long-term investors should average in. We believe we are in the worst earnings recession of the last 40 years, expecting a 43% earnings recession ending at the end of 2009. But we do believe at 8 times trailing earnings, or 14 times our estimate of end of 2009 trough earnings, the bad news is in the price, and we do not wish to be short equities... </p> <p>\"Our idea [is] that the severe part of the bear market is over, that there is value, but probably no hurry, as there are many short-term risks related to emerging markets, foreign exchange and deleveraging. The more prudent investor may wish to stay in cash and not be overweight equities, but our advice is not to be short or underweight anymore. Our advice is also for long-term investors to keep on averaging in at these and lower levels.</p> <p>\"The latest elements that pushed us [to a buy signal] have been a capitulation among retail investors, purchasing managers and sell-side analysts, as measured by record mutual fund outflows, ISM new orders below 40 and analysts revisions collapsing. The idea is that when these three groups know about the bad news, equity prices are probably already reflecting it.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And lo and behold, the market is now edging higher after its earlier losses. The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is now up 34.15 points at 4477.43. With US voters finally due to deliver their verdict on Barack Obama and John McCain today, the Dow Jones futures are pointing to a 109 point opening rise on Wall Street.</p> <p>Perhaps a sixth day of FTSE 100 rises is on the cards after all.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> defeated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> by a landslide today \u2026 but, so far, only in two small hill villages in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/new-hampshire\">New Hampshire</a>.</p> <p>Dixville Notch and Hart's Location have just 115 residents between them and kept up their tradition of being the first to cast their votes on election day.</p> <p>The usually Republican strongholds went for the Democratic candidate by a big margin.</p> <p>In Dixville Notch, Obama notched up 15 votes to McCain's six. In Hart's Location they voted 17 to 10 in Obama's favour, with two voters going for the libertarian candidate, Ron Paul. The Independent candidate, Ralph Nader, got no votes in either village.</p> <p>The village also identified the very first voter in the election to be Tanner Nelson Tillotson, after his name was drawn out of a bowl. He said he voted for Obama and \"wasn't surprised\" by the candidate's win.</p> <p>Dixville Notch had only voted for a Democratic candidate once before. In 1968 it bucked the national trend by voting for Hubert Humphrey rather than the Republican Richard Nixon, who went on to win the election.</p> <p>The villages take pride in getting every voter to the polls at midnight on election day. Each voter gets an individual booth so there are no queues.</p> <p>While New Hampshire law requires polls to open at 11am at the latest, the state allows towns to open polls earlier and then close once all registered and eligible voters have cast their ballots.</p> <p>Dixville Notch has been the first to announce its votes since 1948.</p> <p>Hart's Location grew weary of the publicity of early voting and ended the tradition in 1964, but brought it back again in 1996.</p> <p>The tradition began so as to allow railway workers to vote before their early morning shifts.</p>",
  "<p>After almost two years, and having covered seven states in the final 24 hours, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> gave his last stump speech of the 2008 presidential campaign in the early hours of election day.</p> <p>A little over two hours previously, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/04/uselections2008-barackobama3\">first official results of the election</a> had been announced in the hamlet of Dixville Notch, New Hampshire. In something of a landslide, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> won 15 votes to John McCain's 6.</p> <p>Appearing on the steps of the Yavapai county courthouse in Prescott, in his home state of Arizona, McCain reiterated some of the most well-worn lines from his stump speech while urging his supporters to encourage people to vote.</p> <p>\"It's been a long journey and we've got one more day,\" he told the crowd of a few thousand gathered in the city's historic central plaza. \"We're closing in the polls. All we've got to do is get out the vote.\"</p> <p>His speech was brief, possibly because of the arduous final day of campaigning, possibly because of the late hour - he arrived on stage in Prescott at 12.34am (7.34am GMT).</p> <p>\"God bless America,\" he declared. \"It's wonderful to be home. I thank you.\"</p> <p>The choice of Prescott as the final resting place of the McCain-Palin campaign was laden with significance. McCain has made a point of ending all his campaigns in this city; he has never lost an electoral race in Arizona.</p> <p>Although McCain's principal Arizona home is 60 miles away in the crystals and beads mecca of Sedona, he alights on Prescott at election time to summon up the spirit of Arizona's most famous loser, Barry Goldwater.</p> <p>It was on the steps of Prescott's courthouse that Goldwater began and ended his ill-fated campaign for the presidency in 1964. That election led to one of the most sweeping landslides in US presidential history. Unfortunately for the Republicans, Goldwater was trounced, losing to the gangly Texan Democrat Lyndon Johnson.</p> <p>In last night's appearance, McCain invoked both Goldwater and Mo Udall, a Democrat from Arizona who ran for - and lost - a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. McCain took the opportunity to repeat one of his favourite campaign lines, that Arizona is \"the only state in America where mothers don't tell their children they can grow up to be president of the United States. Tomorrow, I'm going to reverse that and be president of the United States.\"</p> <p>His audience, surprisingly mixed for the conservative heartland of a home state senator, was not so convinced. Al Anderson, a financial adviser who was at McCain's April rally in Prescott, admitted the race was going against him.</p> <p>\"You've got to be crazy to run for this job,\" he said. \"You have to over-promise and neither of these guys can deliver half of what they say they can.\"</p> <p>As well as a few hundred noisy Obama supporters marching around the perimeter of the square, there were several inside the barricades listening to the speeches.</p> <p>\"I have friends in the armed services,\" said Shawn Henley, who plans to vote for Obama. \"The ones who are already overseas are for McCain, but a lot of them haven't gone yet.

Each state has a fixed number of votes based on its population size.</em></p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> The Democratic candidate's poll lead in several of the states George Bush won in 2004 gives him greater opportunities to reach this figure. A win in Virginia, where polls close at midnight GMT, would suggest Obama is on course for victory in some previously Republican states. A win in two of the big three swing states of past election cycles \u2013 Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania \u2013 would all but guarantee him the White House.</p> <p><strong>McCain:</strong> The Republican candidate's route to the Oval Office is much narrower. Among the states Bush won in 2004, at least six are leaning towards Obama and several others are toss-ups. In addition to the safe Republican states, McCain's most likely victory will come if he can hold Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia and Missouri, and take Pennsylvania or some combination of New Hampshire, Iowa, New Mexico and Colorado.</p> <p>Regardless of when one candidate reaches the magic 270 electoral votes needed to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/uselections2008\">win the presidency</a>, the night contains enough subplots and intrigues to keep insomniac politicos occupied late into the night.</p> <h2>11pm GMT</h2> <p>Polls close in <strong>Kentucky</strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/indiana\">Indiana</a></strong>. </p> <p>Kentucky is sure to hand McCain its eight electoral votes, but Obama has surged in the polls in Indiana (11 electoral votes) and threatens to be the first Democrat to win the state since Lyndon Johnson's landslide defeat of Barry Goldwater in 1964. If Obama can overcome Indiana's deep-seated conservatism, it indicates that economic concerns have outweighed cultural ones and Obama can expect a landslide victory.</p> <h2>Midnight GMT</h2> <p>Polls close in <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/florida\">Florida</a></strong>, <strong>Georgia</strong>, <strong>New Hampshire</strong>, <strong>South Carolina</strong>, <strong>Vermont</strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/virginia\">Virginia</a></strong>.</p> <p>Florida (27 electoral votes) was the site of the 2000 voting-counting fiasco in which the supreme court gave the state \u2013 and therefore the election \u2013 to Bush. It is a must-win for McCain but last-minute legal tussles and discrepancies in the voter rolls may delay results. </p> <p>McCain remains popular among Florida's military voters and the culturally conservative north of the state. Obama did not campaign here in the Democratic primary race, but nevertheless pulled ahead of McCain in mid-September when the US economy began tanking in earnest.</p> <p>Georgia (15 electoral votes) is a usually staunch Republican state but threatened by Obama in this election. Propelled by unprecedented enthusiasm among the state's black voters, Obama has pulled within striking distance. An Obama victory here would upend 40 years of conventional thinking about race in southern politics. Virginia (13 electoral votes), another state once part of the slave-owning confederacy, has not backed a Democrat since 1964, but demographic changes, especially in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, DC, have given Obama an advantage.</p> <p>South Carolina (eight electoral votes) is safe for McCain and Vermont (three electoral votes) will back Obama. New Hampshire voters have a long-held fondness for McCain \u2013 he won the state's Republican primary in 2000 and this year \u2013 but Obama made a surge in the polls mid-September and is likely to capture the state's four electoral votes.</p> <h2>12.30am GMT</h2> <p>Polls close in <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/northcarolina\">North Carolina</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ohio\">Ohio</a></strong> and <strong>West Virginia</strong>.</p> <p>If Obama wins Ohio (20 electoral votes) he has the election, but even if he takes only North Carolina (15 electoral votes), McCain's options are seriously limited. Both are toss-up states where Obama maintained a slight lead in polling going into election day. West Virginia (five electoral votes) will go to McCain. </p> <p>(One hurdle to a decisive result: Ohio has been the scene of bitter partisan legal wrangling over the voting process. If election officials, Democrats and Republicans can agree who is eligible to vote, where voting machines should be allocated, and which votes should be counted, expect a smooth night. <br>If the campaigns call out the lawyers, we may not see decisive results from Ohio tonight.)</p> <h2>1am GMT</h2> <p>Polls close in 18 states (plus Washington, DC) awarding a total of 205 electoral votes. </p> <p><strong>Connecticut</strong>, <strong>Delaware</strong>, <strong>Illinois</strong>, <strong>Maine</strong>, <strong>Maryland</strong>, <strong>Massachusetts</strong>, <strong>Michigan</strong>, <strong>New Jersey</strong>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a></strong> and <strong>Washington, DC</strong> will likely go to Obama, giving him 113 electoral votes. </p> <p><strong>Alabama</strong>, <strong>Kansas</strong>, <strong>Mississippi</strong>, <strong>Nebraska</strong>, <strong>Oklahoma</strong>, <strong>South Dakota</strong>, <strong>Tennessee</strong> and <strong>Texas</strong> should give McCain their combined 81 electoral votes.</p> <p><strong>Missouri</strong> could go either way. Bush won the state twice \u2013 but so did Bill Clinton. If Obama wins the state's 11 electoral votes, he can start popping champagne corks.</p> <h2>1.30am GMT</h2> <p><strong>Arkansas</strong> will send its six electoral votes to McCain. Clinton's home state voted for him twice but Democratic candidates since then - Al Gore, John Kerry and now Obama - have been a poor fit with the state's rural and socially conservative mould.</p> <h2>2am GMT</h2> <p>Polls close in <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/minnesota\">Minnesota</a></strong>, <strong>New York</strong>, <strong>Rhode Island</strong>, <strong>Wisconsin</strong>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/colorado\">Colorado</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newmexico\">New Mexico</a></strong>, <strong>Wyoming</strong>, <strong>Louisiana</strong> and <strong>Arizona</strong>.</p> <p>Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island and Wisconsin should go to Obama, handing him 55 electoral votes. Colorado and New Mexico are leaning towards Obama, and he could pick up these two from the Republicans, for an additional 14 votes. Wyoming and Louisiana should give McCain another 12, although Obama has made late polling gains in Louisiana (nine electoral votes), which has one of the largest African American populations in the country.</p> <p>Last week polls showed Obama gaining swiftly in Arizona, McCain's home state. If Obama takes Arizona's 10 electoral votes, McCain may want to leave politics for good. (The scenario occurred in 2000, when Gore lost Tennessee to Bush.)</p> <h2>3am GMT</h2> <p>Polls close in <strong>Idaho</strong>, <strong>Montana</strong>, <strong>Utah</strong>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iowa\">Iowa</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nevada\">Nevada</a></strong> and <strong>North Dakota</strong>.</p> <p>Idaho, Montana and Utah will send McCain 12 more electoral votes. Iowa should vote for Obama, giving him seven electoral votes. Obama could also take Nevada from the Republicans, for five more electoral votes. North Dakota (three electoral votes) has not voted for a Democrat since 1964, but if Obama is having a very good night he may take this too.</p> <h2>4am GMT</h2> <p>Polls close in <strong>California</strong>, <strong>Hawaii</strong>, <strong>Oregon</strong> and <strong>Washington</strong>.</p> <p>If you're still up at this hour, you may watch the states above send their combined 77 votes for Obama, possibly putting him over the 270 needed to win the election. </p> <h2>5am GMT</h2> <p>Polls close in <strong>Alaska</strong>.</p> <h2>How it works</h2> <p>Television stations and the Associated Press, America's leading news agency, are under tremendous pressure to call the results early. They base their predictions on incoming vote tallies, divining the results from precinct-by-precinct results, plus exit polling, and identifying trends where possible. The model works in states where one candidate wins by a sizeable margin, but in close races news organisations must wait until most of the precinct totals are in. Sometimes this can take a while.</p> <p>News junkies will be watching to see which news network calls the election first. The television networks face a dilemma \u2013 they want to declare a winner early but have memories of the disputed Florida vote of 2000 and are fearful of calling it wrong. No editor or news executive wants a replay of the 1948 election, which ended with Harry Truman holding a copy of the Chicago Tribune that bore the banner headline \"Dewey Defeats Truman\".</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339295746\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1898975213_FREEDLAND-FIX-FLV-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Arms flapping and bellowing wildly, Virginia's former Republican governor Jim Gilmore declared that the crowds for McCain this last weekend were growing bigger and bigger, thousands upon thousands of people stretching as far as the eye could see. He gestured out towards the edges of his audience, which consisted of 3,000 or so dispirited McCain cohorts gathered at an interstate van lines facility at Springfield, Virginia in the Washington suburbs, to wait for their beleaguered candidate. \"Keep Virginia red!\" someone shouted. The others briefly took up the chant. </p> <p>Gilmore, who once fancied himself as a presidential candidate, is now running a losing campaign for Senate against the popular former Democratic governor Mark Warner, who has a 2-1 lead in the polls. After he sputtered to a conclusion, the retiring Republican senator John Warner took up the theme of the rally: the heroic story of John McCain. After him, Lindsay Graham, the pitbull from South Carolina, introduced Cindy McCain, who he said was beautiful, kind-hearted, and owned a beer distributorship. Her dad, Graham said, had been shot down three times in world war two. And John McCain, he was a prisoner for five and a half years \"and never left his colleagues behind\". Next Cindy McCain took the microphone and promised her husband would bring \"our children home with honour\". \"Duty, honour. country. Country first,\" she said to cheers of \"USA, USA\".</p> <p>Finally McCain was there. \"I need your help,\" he shouted. \"We're going to fight to the end ... I've been fighting since I was 17 ... I am not afraid to fight ... The pundits have written me off ... Obama is measuring the drapes ... [We're] a few points down, but we're coming back ... I am an American. I choose to fight ... Don't give up. Stand up and fight. Nothing is inevitable. Never give up. Never quit.\" </p> <p>Despite the literal meaning of his words, McCain seemed to be telling his supporters not that he could still triumph, but that he planned to go down fighting. Perhaps he was seeking to grasp at the genuine courage and fortitude he once displayed during his grueling Vietnam experience, and transpose it on to his present circumstances. </p> <p>All of this might have been quite poignant if only John McCain hadn't run such a dreadful campaign, pandered to the worst interests in his party, and sold out whatever semblance of a maverick soul he may once have had. And if only he didn't sound so nuts.</p>",

October 11, 2008<br><strong>Joe the Plumber</strong><br>Barack Obama's original encounter with the Ohio man whose rise to prominence in the campaign marked its last, most exhausted, weirdest weeks</p>",
  "<p>If the United States today elects an African American man to the presidency, that event will mark a turning point in US history and culture. It will genuinely represent a triumph of hope over fear - all the more so because Barack Obama for the most part ran a dignified and inclusive campaign, in the face of the hateful and divisive rhetoric of John McCain. It's significance cannot be overstated, Yet, as Ken Silverstein of Harpers observes, an Obama victory is \"not about politics but about the man.\" Ironically, Obama may transform the face and spirit of a nation, without dramatically changing the substance of its policies.</p> <p>As everyone knows, Obama is a cautious politician. He doesn't look like a leader who is ready to launch anything as bold as FDR's New Deal. But then, Roosevelt didn't initially look like that kind of leader, either. Perhaps if Obama wins the White House he will be emboldened by the remarkable groundswell of support that put him there. Perhaps he will be one of those men who has greatness thrust upon him, and will become fully worthy of the faith and optimism that so many millions have invested in him.<br> But in the humdrum world of political reality, what happens in the coming years will depend a great deal upon the behind-the-scenes workings of Congress, without which significant change cannot take place. All the polls indicate the Democrats will increase their majorities in both the House and Senate, but whether the character and direction of Congress changes is hard to predict. Since they gained control of Congress in 2006, the Democrats have been careful and conservative. Although they ran against the war in 2006, congressional Democrats voted to continue the war. Despite perennial calls for healthcare reform, the only program that actually materialized came from Republicans, in the highly compromised form of Medicare drug subsidies for the elderly. The Democrats promised to root out corruption and malfeasance, and while much has been exposed under the leadership of Henry Waxman and a few others, the exposure so far has resulted in few real consequences and little change. Social welfare programs have been cut back and state government budgets have continued haemorrhaging. As for the roots of the current financial crisis, the Democrats, if the truth be told, largely stood by while the financial regulatory structure established during the New Deal was dismantled. Some, like those in Bill Clinton's treasury department, were in fact all too eager to lend a hand.</p> <p>Some of these facts can be blamed on the presence of a rightwing Republican in the White House and a Democratic congressional majority too slim to survive a Senate filibuster, much less a presidential veto. Others, mostly likely, have deeper causes. What obstacles to real change would remain with a Democratic president and a stronger majority in Congress?</p> <p>\u2022 In Iraq, it means mustering a sizeable coalition that can implement a policy to bring the troops home. But does that mean leaving Iraq altogether? Probably not. The key to Iraq has always been oil, and we still need the oil. One way or another, obtaining that oil will depend on divvying up what were under Saddam nationalized reserves and putting them into the hands of the international oil companies, returning essentially to the days at the beginning of the 20th century when those companies created a cartel. The US military already has set down a long-term policy of maintaining permanent bases in the region. That is unlikely to change any time soon, although meaningful changes in energy policy could begin to gradually have their effect. As for Afghanistan, the west has tried without success to dominate the place for centuries. A stalemate is likely to continue indefinitely.</p> <p>\u2022 The debate over universal healthcare has been carried on nonstop since before Medicare was enacted in the 1960s. Everyone in Washington knows the clear course here: improve and extend Medicare to everyone. To make that work, the government must reign in the drug prices and eliminate the participation of the insurance industry. But the unwritten deal on Capitol Hill is that token reforms - getting rid of the gap in Medicare Part D, for example, or negotiating better drug prices - can be discussed, but only if everyone agrees to the participation of the insurance and pharmaceutical companies. Only the most incremental changes, therefore, are even remotely possible.</p> <p>\u2022 The financial mess requires direct government participation in reorganising defaulting mortgages with public financing if need be. It requires reinstatement in one form or another of the New Deal Glass Steagall Act that separated investment banking from banking. And most of all it requires a drastic reform in the Federal Reserve System, the central bank that is run not by Congress but by the banking industry. Wall Street is unlikely to stand for any of these changes - and a Congress and a president with campaigns so lavishly financed by the finance industry is unlikely to force them through. The Democrats will undoubtedly pursue some modest regulatory improvements, but nothing like what $700bn ought to buy.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, creating a fairer and sounder tax system would mean taking on the formidable bloc of conservative Democrats in the House. These fiscal conservatives can be counted on to join with conservative Republicans to fight for fiscal conservative measures which in the past often end up as cuts to the social welfare programs.</p> <p>What might happen under an Obama presidency is certainly a preferable alternative to the warmongering free-market free-for-all promised by John McCain. But the promised change, when it boils down to policy, will be modest, slow, and hard-won - and no doubt disappointing to some who expected more of the new world they worked so hard to create.</p>",
  "<p>A police sign on the packed roads leading to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>'s rally last night read \"Expect delays: Major Event\". It was a major event: the final rally - after almost two years of campaigning - before today's election that could see him win the White House.</p> <p>The crowd, which Obama put at 100,000, knew the importance of the occasion. So, too, did the street sellers, out with their wares for the last time. Their goods reflected the optimism that Democrats are finding it harder by the hour to suppress: T-shirts declared \"Obama Victory\" while hatbands read \"President Obama\".</p> <p>It was an astonishing turnout, one of the biggest of the campaign, second only to the 120,000 he attracted in St Louis, Missouri, and remarkable because it was in the heart of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/virginia\">Virginia</a>, a state that had until only a few months ago been regarded as safely Republican.</p> <p>There was a festive atmosphere at the rally, partly because it was held in a fairground park but mainly because the Democratic crowd was in the mood to celebrate what they expect to be a victory today. \"There is a strong sense of anticipation. It feels like Christmas Eve,\" one emotional supporter said.</p> <p>Another, Chris Malcolm, 23, who works at a community college in Largo, Maryland, said: \"Tomorrow is going to change our lives one way or another.\" Malcolm, an African-American, said Obama getting this far had helped race relations in America and becoming president would help break down barriers even more.</p> <p>Small pockets of African-Americans in the diverse crowd prayed that he would be successful in the election and as president, and for his protection. Other African-Americans expressed concerns about his safety, wondering if there was safety glass separating him from the crowd.</p> <p>Obama spoke late at night, an hour before midnight and election day. \"This is the last rally of a campaign that began almost two years ago,\" he said. \"Whatever happens tomorrow, I have been deeply humbled by this journey.\"</p> <p>He mentioned briefly the death of his grandmother and thanked people who had sent condolences. He seemed tired, stumbling over words and figures.</p> <p>But he warmed up towards the end, perhaps feeling an obligation towards people he had kept waiting for hours, or just a need to mark the occasion. Seeming to realise the same old stump speech that many would have heard on television was not going down well, he switched to a long, wistful anecdote about the early days of the campaign when he had few supporters or endorsements, and how he had been lifted by an encounter with an elderly woman in South Carolina who had shouted at him, \"Fired up. Ready to go\", which subsequently became a chant among his supporters.</p> <p>After securing the Democratic nomination in the summer, he chose to begin his presidential election campaign in Bristol, Virginia. At the time, it seemed a quirky choice, with the state apparently solid Republican.</p> <p>But he is in with more than a chance of taking Virginia today and so made it his last campaign stop with the rally in Manassas, a quiet town now but the scene of one of the bloodiest battles of the civil war.</p> <p>To take Virginia would be rich in symbolism. Obama acknowledged as much last night when he referred to Richmond, Virginia, as \"the capital of the Old Confederacy\". He said he found it extraordinary that 100,000 people in the state had come out to see him on a Monday night.</p> <p>John McCain attracted only 8,000 when he held a rally on the other side of Manassas a fortnight ago. The Republican stood on his tiptoes to wave at the expected crowd at the back, only to find there wasn't any.</p> <p>Obama told supporters at his rally: \"I have just one word for you: tomorrow.\" He shouted, maybe for the last time, another campaign slogan: \"Yes, we can.\" And the crowd shouted back: \"Yes, we can.\"</p> <p>Then he headed off to his home and headquarters in Chicago, where he will stay, apart from a short trip to Indiana for election day campaigning, to await the result of the election.</p>",
  "<p>In an election campaign this long, and this filled with memorable moments, strange things begin to happen to memory and one's sense of time: it feels like years ago now that Barack Obama, somewhat stunned, approached the podium to celebrate victory in the Iowa caucuses, and more than three weeks since Joe the Plumber ambled into our lives.

  "<p>Canvassing for Obama in the Florida Keys: Conch Harbour, Pecan Lane, Rose Lane, Hurricane Alley \u2013 every street I canvass I get the same story. For instance: I ask for James \"Two Star\" Scott, a name on the list of registered voters given to me by the Obama campaign office. And I am told: \"He comes and goes.\" Finally out of exasperation I ask: \"Comes and goes! What do you mean he comes and goes?\"</p> <p>Turns out that all these guys are boat captains who come and go: to Bermuda, Bahama, Key Largo. I am in Key West and the references are all Caribbean. I am 80 miles from Havana and 124 miles from mainland America. To get here we drove over miles of ocean linked by Keys, the spectacular archipelago of islands off southern Florida: Sugarloaf Key, Duck Key, No Name Key, where anti-Cuban guerrillas trained in the 60s.</p> <p>The pace for volunteers here isn't as hectic as in the mainland offices but there is a sense of urgency. We are told that we need to deliver the Keys for Obama in order to balance the Republican vote in the northern I-4 corridor of Florida that stretches from Tampa to Orlando.</p> <p>Hence the days spent walking up and down the island to ensure every registered Democrat votes. Fifty per cent have already done so under the early voting scheme and the numbers so far are favouring Obama approximately 60-40 in the Upper Keys; in the Lower Keys it is reversed to McCain 60-40. The scales could tip either way. </p> <p>Part of the reason Florida is in play at all is because of the campaign's tremendous field-based effort to build voter lists through the \"Votebuilder\" data-bank, and because of the Democratic national committee's <a href=\"http://www.democrats.org/a/party/a_50_state_strategy/\">50-state strategy</a> under Howard Dean's leadership. In addition to the GOTV effort, the Obama campaign is taking no chances on election day: lawyers are being sent to every polling station to make sure there are no dirty tricks this time around.</p> <p>Though in Key West, the <a href=\"http://www.keysnet.com/news/story/29904.html\">hanky panky</a> seems to be of a different sort. The Sheriff has just been outed for doing \"nooners\" with his secretary; someone running for a district Mosquito Board turns out to have been <a href=\"http://www.kwtn-blue.com/2008/10/jailed-bug-board.html\">a porn star</a>; constitutional amendment No 2 takes away healthcare benefits and other protections for unmarried partners but has been misleadingly worded as the \"Florida Marriage Protection\" amendment.</p> <p>The reason any of this is relevant is because all these issues are on the ballot list, where in the Keys, in addition to picking the president, you also get to voice your opinion on eight constitutional amendments and on candidates running for everything from the Mosquito Board to sheriff, circuit judge to Congress.</p> <p>I am not having much luck with my list of voters. The next one I meet tells me that he can't vote because he has a felony for laying out crab traps. I think he must be pulling my leg, so I ring up the Obama office to check. Turns out that in Florida even once you have served your time you have to apply to the governor to have your rights reinstated. Without that permission you can't vote, among other things.</p> <p>There seem to be quite a few people just out of prison here. Along with a vibrant gay community, Cubans, Jews, a lot of retirees, an old Bahamanian community of blacks and whites who have been here for over 150 years, and other \"conchs\" (islanders who have been here here for generations).</p> <p>In the midst of my canvassing, I naughtily sneak in a 20-minute break to check out the 19th century house of one such conch, <a href=\"http://www.heritagehousemuseum.org/html/jessie.htm\">Miss Jessie Porter</a>, famous for her dinner parties with guests such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallulah_Bankhead\">Tallulah Bankhead</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imagi-nation.com/moonstruck/clsc9.htm\">Tennessee Williams</a>, <a href=\"http://www.timelesshemingway.com/faq/faq1.shtml#briefbio\">Ernest Hemingway</a> and Robert Frost. Key West is a great place to relax. The streets are lined with palms, banyans, bougainvilleas and hibiscus, the clapboard houses have southern-colonial style wrap-around lace porches, elaborate confections in pastel pinks, violets and pistachios. Laid back during the day and a carnivale atmosphere in the evenings, pina coladas and Key Lime pies.</p> <p>We are very spoilt volunteers. An Obama supporter who owns a hotel, appropriately named Eden House, is putting us up. In this Floridian Art Deco hotel from the 1920s, we have a hammock outside our room, a book on Buddhism on our bedside table, palm trees and an azure sky to admire. People see us with our Obama signs and beckon us into their shops to chat about politics. Mr Johnson of the Johnson Grocery Store, a Bahamanian in his 50s whose family has been here for generations, gives me a postcard on which he writes: \"Nur, god bless you.\" On Duval Street, a teenager who is too young to vote and is working at an ice cream parlour gives me a vanilla custard ice-cream in support of Obama.</p> <p>What will we do once the election is over? It has been a gift outright to see America in this way. These words are in my mind, as I have just read <a href=\"http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-gift-outright/\">The Gift Outright</a>, the poem that Robert Frost wrote at Miss Jessie's house and recited at John F Kennedy's inauguration.

  "<p>Pakistan delivered a blunt message yesterday to America's new military commander for the region, warning General David Petraeus on his first international trip since taking the job that US missile strikes inside Pakistan must stop.</p> <p>Petraeus, credited with pulling Iraq back from the brink, pointedly made Pakistan his first visit to the region, after last week assuming overall command of the Middle East and Central Asia, including Iraq and Afghanistan. Pakistan's co-operation is considered vital if the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan is to be quelled, but Islamabad has been incensed by US missile attacks inside its territory against suspected militants.</p> <p>\"Continuing drone attacks on our territory, which result in loss of precious lives and property, are counterproductive and difficult to explain by a democratically-elected government. It is creating a credibility gap,\" Pakistan's president Asif Zardari told Petraeus, according to a statement issued by the president's office.</p> <p>Petraeus also held meetings yesterday with Pakistani army chief Ashfaq Kayani and defence minister Ahmad Mukhtar, in which a similar message was reportedly conveyed. However, the strikes, which have intensified greatly over the past two months, killing dozens and causing uproar in Pakistan, are expected to go on.</p> <p>Before 9/11 Pakistan had backed the Taliban government in Kabul, and its all-powerful army is believed to still support elements within the Taliban, seeing the Karzai government as allied with arch-enemy India.</p> <p>\"Pakistan has been targeting different Taliban factions than the US,\" said Farrukh Saleem, executive director of the Centre for Research and Security Studies, a thinktank based in Islamabad. \"Pakistan is being encircled. There are Indian troops in the east, and Nato, the US and the Afghan national army to the west.\"</p> <p>Analysts believe that the missile attacks are damaging an already weak civilian government in Islamabad, following the restoration of democracy earlier this year after more than eight years of military rule, providing an opening that anti-American Islamist politicians can exploit.</p> <p>Last year Petraeus instigated a fresh approach in Iraq, with a \"surge\" of thousands of extra US troops and a successful ploy of separating the Sunni nationalist insurgents from al-Qaida, by turning the Iraqi Sunni Muslims against the global jihadists inspired by Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>In Afghanistan the two key tenets of this counter-insurgency strategy are expected to be replicated.</p> <p>\"Petraeus does understand that, while the basic template from Iraq is applicable in Afghanistan and Pakistan, there are many differences,\" said Kamran Bokhari, director of Middle East analysis at Stratfor, a private US geopolitical intelligence firm. \"The key difference is that Iraq was a sectarian conflict.\"</p> <p>Petraeus used the threat of Shia Muslim dominance in Iraq to entice the Sunnis into the mainstream, whereas there are already large Sunni majorities in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Washington and Kabul are starting to engage in tentative talks with figures associated with the Afghan Taliban, but past attempts at winning over \"moderate\" Taliban have failed.</p> <p>The US general will soon have a new boss following the US presidential election, with both candidates pledging to focus on Afghanistan and provide more troops, especially Barack Obama, who has repeatedly said that Afghanistan and Pakistan is where the fight against terrorism must be won.</p>",
  "<p>The US government is proving reluctant to broaden its bail-out of the banking sector by supporting the struggling motor industry through direct capital injections into Detroit's cash-strapped \"big three\" carmakers.</p> <p>After weeks of negotiation, the US treasury has reportedly said that it will not provide General Motors with the $10bn (\u00a36bn) the company needs to ease a merger with fellow struggler Chrysler, spurning pleas from GM's boss Rick Wagoner and from the governors of six industrial states.</p> <p>Instead, any relief is likely to come through an acceleration of $25bn in federal loans under an environmental initiative to help fund the development of fuel-efficient cars.</p> <p>The US government faces a delicate balancing act. GM's rival, Ford, has declared that it expects \"parity\" if any taxpayers' money benefits GM and Chrysler. Economists have warned that if either Ford or GM collapses, the number of job losses among the carmakers' suppliers could top two million.</p> <p>The accounting firm Grant Thornton last week calculated that a merger of the two car companies could cost 12,000 union jobs.</p> <p>The motor companies' struggles have become an issue in the final days of the presidential election trail as battleground states such as Ohio and Indiana are home to thousands of car workers.</p> <p>The Democratic candidate Barack Obama has pledged to meet urgently with union leaders and motor industry bosses if he is elected, saying he wants to keep \"every option\" on the table.</p> <p>His opponent, John McCain, has backed an acceleration of the department of energy's $25bn in environmental loans, telling ABC television: \"I would do whatever I think needs to be done to help out the auto industry. We need to keep this industry alive.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Healthcare</h2> <p>Barack Obama would require companies to cover all Americans regardless of their health. For those who do not receive coverage from their employers, he would create a registry of private health insurance plans and offer coverage through the government. Employers would be required either to provide health insurance or pay into a pool to support the national plan. He would subsidise coverage for low-income Americans.</p> <p>John McCain's plan would encourage Americans to purchase their own insurance coverage rather than get it from their employers. He would offer a tax credit to individuals who do so, but would tax the value of employee health benefits. He would allow people to purchase health insurance plans from any state in the country, pre-empting state-level coverage regulations.</p> <h2>Taxes</h2> <p>Obama would allow President Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy to expire but would cut taxes for low- and moderate-income Americans and senior citizens. He would also increase some payroll taxes for Americans who make more than $200,000 per year (or $250,000 for married couples), and increase the maximum tax rate on capital gains.</p> <p>McCain would make Bush's tax cuts permanent and increase the tax deduction for dependents. He would also trim the corporate income tax rate. On the whole, McCain's tax plan would reduce federal revenue by $4.2tn, compared to $2.9tn for Obama, according to the Tax Policy Centre.</p> <h2>Iraq</h2> <p>Obama has pledged to begin withdrawing US combat troops from Iraq immediately, and would have all troops out of the country within about 16 months.</p> <p>McCain was a staunch proponent of the war and the later troop \"surge\". McCain was criticised earlier this year for saying US troops could be in Iraq for \"100 years\", but in May he proposed a plan to heavily cut back the US presence by 2013.</p> <h2>Housing market and economic stimulus</h2> <p>Both candidates voted in the Senate for the government's $700bn rescue plan which intended to inject liquidity into the US credit market. </p> <p>Obama further proposes tax breaks for companies that create jobs, extending $25bn to fund road and school construction and maintenance. He would also allow Americans to withdraw from tax-free retirement accounts without penalty until 2010, and would institute a 90-day moratorium on home foreclosures.</p> <p>McCain would spend $300bn to purchase mortgages that have outstripped the value of the home they are attached to, replacing them with fixed-rate loans reflecting the reduced value of the property. He would reduce taxes on retirement account withdrawals until 2010 and would not require retirees to withdraw from retirement accounts if they would face a penalty.</p> <h2>Abortion</h2> <p>John McCain supports overturning Roe v Wade, the 1973 US supreme court decision which prohibited states from banning abortion. He believes that states should then pass laws outlawing the procedure.</p> <p>Barack Obama supports women's right to choose abortion and has proposed federal funding for comprehensive sex education and to improve awareness of emergency contraception.</p> <h2>Immigration</h2> <p>Both candidates support a comprehensive immigration reform plan that would establish some path to legal status for the roughly 12 million illegal immigrants living and working in the country. They would both increase the number of visas for low-skilled workers and bolster border security and enforcement.</p> <h2>Iran</h2> <p>Obama favours direct, high-level talks with Iran but says if Tehran refuses to give up its nuclear programme, he will step up economic pressure and seek to isolate the regime further.</p> <p>McCain has signalled he will not significantly depart from Bush's policy. He has called for broad sanctions against Iran and a South African-style divestment campaign to persuade Tehran to drop its nuclear programme.</p> <h2>Israel</h2> <p>Obama maintains he is firmly committed to maintaining strong US-Israel ties, including military and economic aid. He would continue US support for a two-state solution, although he caused a stir in June when he said Jerusalem should be the capital of Israel.</p> <p>McCain has pledged to increase military aid to Israel. He has said that the Palestinians are \"badly served\" by Hamas, but he appears willing to broker negotiations. </p> <h2>Energy</h2> <p>Both candidates favour expanding production of biofuels such as corn-based ethanol. Both back expanding nuclear energy usage, but Obama stresses that any new nuclear capacity must be accompanied by adequate environmental and security safeguards. </p> <p>McCain has enthusiastically called for an increase in oil drilling, especially off US coastal waters. Obama initially opposed increased drilling but now says he would consider it as part of a broader energy package that included environmental protections.</p> <p>McCain proposes a $300m prize for the successful development of a plug-in electric car. Obama would offer a tax-credit to purchasers of high-tech energy-efficient vehicles.</p> <h2>Guant\u00e1namo Bay</h2> <p>Both candidates would close the camp. Obama has criticised the system of military tribunals established by Bush, but has offered few specifics on how he would handle prisoners there. McCain supports the tribunals and has vowed to overturn a court ruling granting prisoners the right to contest their detention.</p>",
  "<p>It was already going to be an exciting week for black communities across the world, but when a team of West Indian cricketers won the Stanford cricket match, and then, 10 seconds before the finish line, Lewis Hamilton made his move on Timo Glock, Dotun Adebayo, presenting his BBC London radio show, couldn't help himself. Would this be, he asked, \"the beginning of the greatest week ever in black history\"?</p> <p>The issue of role models is, of course, a perennial debate within and outside the black community - who are they? And where are they, when they are so urgently needed? Will this week prove a kind of tipping point? Simon Woolley, director and co-founder of Operation Black Vote, who was a guest on Adebayo's show, sincerely hopes so - and believes he has reason to. For one thing, he is emotionally exhausted by the drama of Hamilton's win - because, \"it's like watching your child race, such an emotional rollercoaster - that's the emotional investment we've got\". For him, and everybody else who recognised themselves in the young mixed-race man from Stevenage, the win was particularly piquant because, \"it's about winning against adversity. Yes, because he's a young black man we're proud. But we've watched him face the most wretched racist abuse. Our journey to sucess is always peppered by obstacles of racism. So when we do succeed, particularly with great dignity ... \"</p> <p>For another, he has been seeing the effect of Obama's candidacy, from day to day, and is bowled over by it. A couple of weeks ago, he ran an event in Brixton, called Equanomics, a project that looks at political and economic empowerment for black communities. \"We would have been happy if 50 showed up - but we got 300, many under 25. Look, we've got a black man who could be the most powerful person in the world. He's speaking our language, he looks like us - our organisation is riding the crest of an Obama wave. It's the dawn of a new era.\" </p> <p>For nine months, Operation Black Vote has been running a political mentoring scheme they have been calling the Barack Obama Generation, in which established politicians, mostly in the Welsh Assembly, have agreed to mentor young political hopefuls from minorities. Nine people stepped up, and three - all political novices - are already in positions where they might be elected: Mari Rees has been selected as a Labour candidate for the winnable seat of Pembrokeshire (if she won, she would be the first black politician to be elected in Wales); Elizabeth Musa has been nominated to stand for election to the Welsh Assembly in four years' time; and Shazia Awan has been shortlisted for a Tory seat.</p> <p>But the effect need not be this direct. \"The thing about Lewis Hamilton, and to a big extent Barack Obama,\" says Diane Abbott, MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, \"is that they are running counter to stereotype. They're not sportsmen - obviously formula one motor racing is a sport, but it's not a physical sport. There's this idea that black men have physical prowess, which is not, in itself, unremarkable. Where it's about how fast you can run and how strong you are, you will get black champions. What is interesting about Hamilton, and to a lesser extent Tiger Woods, is that we're talking now about very cerebral sports.\" </p> <p>She has also been interested to see, in the US media, mentions of African-American men \"generally carrying themselves with more pride. Because you've got this black man who could become president, and in any event has been centre-stage in this campaign. I think it does have an effect - we're in a society, both in America and Britain, where black men are demonised and vilified. I mean most weeks you can pick up a newspaper and unless they're a sportsman it means they've killed someone or they're mad. So it's a very good thing to see a positive image of a black man. And more important, in a way, with Barack Obama, a black family. For Americans, the </p> <p>First family is a bit like the royal family for us. So with Barack we're going to have a black family that's a symbol of nationhood, and I think that's quite profound.\"</p> <p>Woolley agrees with this, too. \"On a very basic level, on a daily basis, we see ourselves portrayed in the media as villains. But we can look at this dynamic young black kid, and think, with a bit of luck my child could follow in his success.\" Woolley's partner is Spanish, so they have mixed-race children, and looking at Hamilton and Obama, \"we can say to our children - they look like you. Unless you've got a black child or a mixed-race child the profundity of having such role models would be difficult to grasp.\" </p> <p>Which is all true, but others caution that their achievements are so huge, and so specific and arcane, that the effect, while galvanising in a general sort of way, may not trickle down to, say, a teenager struggling with her GCSEs in Leeds. As Michael Eboda, who for years was editor of the New Nation newspaper, and is now CEO of Powerful Media, which has just published a list of Britain's 100 most influential black people, points out, \"You have to have a particular set of circumstances to do what Hamilton has done: you have to be quite small, be able to raise a lot of money, and be ultra-talented - most kids know that's not what they're going to be.\" </p> <p>He argues that if what Lewis and Obama have done inspires other people, that's brilliant, \"but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that there are lots of other people who are a lot more accessible.\" He often takes the list into schools, and shows it to young black men, in particular. </p> <p>Stereotypes come in all shapes and sizes, and so people assume, for example, the black \"youth\" would be particularly interested in footballers or rappers. But there are only two sportsmen on it. \"They're far, far, far more impressed by a guy like Michael Prest, one of our panellists, whose business turns over a billion a year. They find that far more impressive. It's what they really want to do - a lot of them are interested in music and stuff but a hell of lot of them say they want to be a CEO, or run a company. Or they say they want to be a lawyer, a doctor. You meet the odd one who wants to be a footballer. But they know that either you're good at it or you're not.\" They're interested in Tidjane Thiam, the group finance director for Prudential, who's being groomed to be CEO; they're interested in the most influential person on the list, Dr Mo Ibrahim, who started off working at BT, set up his own company, sold it for for $3.4bn, and now runs a foundation dedicated to promoting good governance in Africa - these they see as possible paths. As for Obama in particular, \"I think we kind of have to look at ourselves and say what are we doing over here? There are a lot of people in very powerful positions here, and they're the ones we in Britain have to look to. I'm not a great fan always looking at America.\" </p> <p>And in the end, the ideal, the hope, is that something more complex and much greater can be achieved; that what the British actor and playwright Kwame Kwei-Armah calls \"a new narrative\" can begin. \"In the past I have been reluctant to accept the mantle of role model but whether you accept it or not, you are,\" says Patricia Scotland, Baroness Scotland of Asthal and now attorney general for England and Wales. In 1991, she became the youngest person to take silk since William Pitt the Younger, and the first black woman to be made a QC. She says she was particularly moved during that year by a father who told her that his nine-year-old daughter had clipped a picture of her out of a newspaper and announced: \"I'm going to do that.\" She now has a degree in law and has been called to the bar. She doesn't tell me what colour this nine-year-old was because, for her, that is not the only point. </p> <p>Of course there is a long way to go, and the website that received a barrage of racist taunts about Hamilton is yet another example. \"But,\" says Baroness Scotland, \"I would say to all young people, not just black young people, 'You can achieve!' Irrespective of your background, your ethnicity, you faith, or your sexual orientation. I think it's a good time for people and not just black people. It's very important for all our children of whatever colour and whatever faith to try and see individuals as that - as individuals who have huge potential to achieve. And I would love us to finally get to the stage when each of our children will look at their own talents as being the final arbiter of what they will do, and not an outward manifestation, or a sexual or other orientation. So they won't say I can't do this, because I am white, or black, or Jewish or Christian or Muslim, or I'm gay or I am straight. That they are able just to say, I am a person of talent. We need to create an environment where that talent is released.\" And to that we can only say amen.</p> <h2>'If Obama gets in, I'm moving to America'</h2> <p><strong>Young black British men on the role models that give them hope</strong></p> <p><strong>Anthony Lawrence, 20, student</strong></p> <p>To know that there might be a black president and to see Hamilton winning makes me feel happy inside, man, because I'm black. There aren't enough role models for the younger generation. Me, I never had a father, and my mum died when I was young. I never had anyone except for my grandma. I wouldn't listen to her, I was always on the street doing what I wanted to do. As soon as Barack Obama came on the scene, I listened to everything he says. He speaks to me, he makes me think that there is another way out of this wartorn world. One of my friends died the other day. He got stabbed. He was 16. I cried, man. It made me feel like I'm the next one to go. </p> <p><strong>Peter Okeowo, 22, student</strong></p> <p>I was watching the race, and I thought Lewis was going to lose - when he won I was really relieved. I felt so proud. He did well despite criticism and I was really happy for him. Now </p> <p>I want Obama to win. I was discussing with my friends whether one day in this country will we have a black prime minister. Most people were saying never. But hopefully it will happen. </p> <p><strong>Moboshir Ali, 19, currently looking for work</strong></p> <p>Lewis Hamilton? Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant. Now he's in the history books. It was so good. I don't care about Obama, though. I give up on politics. I really don't think it will change my life. Politicians don't represent me. I can't do grand-prix racing because I'm no good at driving, but maybe I will get into IT.</p> <p><strong>Joshua Ellison, 17, student</strong></p> <p>Hackney is my hometown, it's easy to blend in - but if Obama gets in, I'm moving to America, bwoy! I'm excited about Lewis Hamilton, too, and really happy for him. If there are black people achieving, it's there in the history books and will live on and on.</p> <p>I want to move to America where there are more opportunities. We all talk about it in class. Some of the kids I know, all they talk about is guns, and if they have someone to look up to, it gives them another option. </p> <p><strong>Duane Mayers, 20, chef</strong></p> <p>It would be great to have a black president. He's grown up the way we've grown up. I've heard about his background and family. He's had that childhood and knows how we live so he will know how to change that. Lewis Hamilton is all right but not such a role model as Obama. </p> <p><strong>Kenny Julian, 18, student</strong></p> <p>I'm not a politics person but it's good to give black people a shot at being president. Give them a chance to prove themselves. </p> <p><strong>Sile Entee, 21, student</strong></p> <p>It's hopeful, but if he turns president, they're going to assassinate him. America's going to have a civil war.</p> <p><strong>Michael Morris, 24, student</strong></p> <p>I rate Barack Obama. He's stronger than the other people. Lewis Hamilton? I rate him too. I'm Jamaican and English, mixed-race. I'm proud to have those mixed-race role models.</p> <p><strong>Rennal Edwards, 15, school student</strong></p> <p>Lewis and Obama, although they're doing different jobs, they're linked. They must both have struggled to be where they are. They've shown it is possible - that dreams do come true.</p> <p>Obama's already shown how we've got a much more modern society, a multicultural society that allows everyone to have an opportunity to be in power, not just one race. And to rule America - that's pretty significant. It means a lot to the world, and to me. The States tends to be followed by the rest of the world. They've let people come into America from all backgrounds and show that they can do well, not just in politics but in all sorts of things, in everything.</p> <p>Lewis Hamilton, now - he's come from not such a high-status background, which makes him a really good role model for people such as myself. I'm going through the experiences he went though when he was a kid. Their success will cut down a lot on racism in the world. Obama, especially, has shown us the way to a better place.</p> <p><strong>Arron Thompson, 16, school student</strong></p> <p>Great to see Lewis Hamilton in the headlines. It'll be a shame if Obama doesn't get there - he's gone so far. His mum's white, maybe that helps. Maybe it helps stop white people getting jealous.</p> <p><strong>Julius Soares, 19, engineering student</strong></p> <p>A black man being president! It makes me feel that in the future I can be whatever I want to be. He's inspired me, definitely. Obama really will make a difference if he becomes president. The fact that his mum's white makes no difference. He's black and he says he's black and that's how it is. Lewis Hamilton too, he also shows that if you just believe, you can achieve whatever you want to achieve. He said that he believed, and that was what counts.<br><strong>Interviews by Anita Sethi and Martin Wainwright</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The inside track: Gemma Briggs speaks to the people behind Lewis Hamilton's success <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/sport\">theguardian.com/sport</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday November 6 2008.

It's so good to hear you. Thank you for calling us.</p> <p><strong>MAA:</strong> Oh, it's a pleasure.</p> <p><strong>SP:</strong> Thank you sir, we have such great respect for you, John McCain and I. We love you! And thank you for taking a few minutes to talk to me.</p> <p><strong>MAA:</strong> I follow your campaigns closely with my special American adviser Johnny Hallyday [a French singer], you know?</p> <p><strong>SP:</strong> Yes! Good ...</p> <p><strong>MAA:</strong> You know I see you as a president one day, you too.</p> <p><strong>SP:</strong> Maybe in eight years.</p> <p><strong>MAA:</strong> Well, I hope for you. You know, we have a lot in common because personally one of my favourite activities is to hunt, too.</p> <p><strong>SP:</strong> Oh, very good. We should go hunting together.</p> <p><strong>MAA:</strong> Exactly, we could go try hunting by helicopter like you did. I never did that. Like we say in French, on pourrait tuer des b\u00e9b\u00e9s phoques, aussi [we could kill baby seals, too].</p> <p><strong>SP:</strong> Well, I think we could have a lot of fun together as we're getting work done. We can kill two birds with one stone that way.</p> <p><strong>MAA:</strong> I just love killing those animals. Mmm, mmm, take away life, that is so fun.

  "<p>It would be wonderful to think that the intense interest with which Europeans are following today's US presidential election might be matched by Americans watching the European parliamentary elections in June 2009. Today the US takes part in the most exciting, and potentially the most important, presidential election in decades. In two months there will be a new administration and Congress in Washington DC. Across the Atlantic - the necessity to ratify the Lisbon treaty notwithstanding - there will by next summer be a new European parliament, and by next autumn in all likelihood a new European commission. </p> <p>This transition on both sides of the Atlantic presents a fresh challenge and a huge opportunity - to relaunch transatlantic relations on a new and more positive footing. We need to put differences and misunderstandings behind us. In Washington and Brussels we should seize the chance to engage in new thinking and commit ourselves to work together on a common agenda for prosperity and peace, not just in Europe and North America but across the globe.</p> <p>We need to prepare the ground immediately. That's why I intend to invite the winner of today's election to come and address the European parliament next year. I would like the new president to visit us in April, on perhaps his first European tour, immediately before the Nato summit. The last time - indeed the only time - that a US president addressed a plenary session of the European parliament was when Ronald Reagan did so in 1985 in Strasbourg, during the cold war years.</p> <p>We have already been strengthening links between the European parliament and Congress at all levels - between parliamentary delegations, between policy committees, between political groups, and between administrative staff. We will continue that important process, speaking frankly as colleagues and friends. At the same time, the symbolic value of a presidential visit to strengthening the bonds between our two great democratic systems cannot be underestimated.</p> <p>The emerging global agenda - of turmoil in the financial markets, climate change, energy security, the Middle East, terrorism and international crime, western responses to the rise of China and India, demographic change and ageing societies - requires legislators to work together on an international scale. If the EU and the US can do this successfully, we can be a major force for prosperity, peace and civilised values.</p> <p>We have a new political commitment to building a barrier-free transatlantic single market in goods and services. Both the US Congress and the European parliament will need to agree to many regulatory and other changes involved in this long-term project. </p> <p>Our work also needs to address public opinion directly, especially among the young.

There is a sense of hope by many in Europe that the new US president will seek to reverse this trend by demonstrating America's willingness to operate on the international stage in a spirit of partnership.</p> <p>We in the EU must aim to put transatlantic relations on a firmer, more positive and more successful foundation.

  "<p>Today's election is poised to end the Republican era in American politics - an era that began in reaction to Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, the Vietnam war and the civil rights revolution, was pioneered by Richard Nixon, consolidated by Ronald Reagan, and wrecked by George W Bush.</p> <p>Almost every aspect of the Republican ascendancy has been discredited and lies in tatters - its policies, politics, and even its version of patriotism - down to the rock-bottom notion that progressive taxation itself, initiated by a Republican president, Theodore Roosevelt, who John McCain hails as his personal icon, is unpatriotic.</p> <p>McCain's own chronic helplessness in establishing rapport, prompting him to latch on to mediums from Sarah Palin to Joe the Plumber, is aggravated by his party's decay. He is an ironic character to make the last stand on behalf of a party he has been at odds with for virtually his whole career. </p> <p>McCain is less a victim of age than of the age - the end of the age of Reagan. Realignments in American party politics are the consequence of catastrophe. The coming of the civil war produced the Republican party that more or less ruled until the Great Depression brought about the New Deal. The modern Republican era began with the fragmentation of the liberal Democratic consensus in 1968 over Vietnam, civil rights and urban mayhem. Southerners and the urban ethnic working and middle classes shifted allegiance, forging a coalition that delivered 49 states first to Nixon in 1972 and then to Reagan in 1984.</p> <p>The strange death of Republican America has been a long time in the making. As early as 1988, the Reagan coalition threatened to unravel. Only when the Republican candidate, George HW Bush, resorted to a vicious campaign - conjuring the pledge of allegiance to the flag and an African-American rapist named Willie Horton, against a worthy and weak Democratic candidate, Michael Dukakis - was the hold on power preserved.</p> <p>In 1992, Bill Clinton won back the white working class and parts of the South, but Republicans fiercely resisted his efforts to restore the authority of progressive government. They shut down the federal government twice and impeached him in the struggle for power. Then in 2000, when his vice-president, Al Gore, ran to succeed him, the conservative majority of the supreme court, by a five to four decision, ordered that votes in Florida not be counted and handed the presidency to George W Bush.</p> <p>Bush was surrounded by the aura of illegitimacy until September 11 granted him what the election had not. But even before this, he acted as if he had won office with a commanding mandate, radicalising the unfulfilled agendas of Nixon and Reagan. Two figures whose origins lay in the Nixon operation, his vice-president Dick Cheney and chief political strategist Karl Rove, provided the grand designs for an imperial presidency and a permanent Republican majority. Just as Reagan was a more radical version of Nixon, Bush was a radicalisation of Reagan. After nearly two terms, his experiment has resulted in worldwide disaster.</p> <p>McCain, Bush's bitter rival in 2000, won the Republican nomination only because conservatives were too fractured to unify behind a single candidate. Bush had shattered them and his influence in choosing a successor was nil. McCain's choice of Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate was a symptom of his simultaneous disdain for his party and his need to patch over its divisions. </p> <p>Despite Bush's unprecedented unpopularity and the general disgrace of the Republicans, two weeks after the Republican convention McCain led in the polls and the key swing states. He appeared to be defying political gravity. Obama, still an uncertainty, was sliding. His advisers held panicked emergency meetings.</p> <p>Then came the crushing blow of the economic crisis. The sub-prime mortgage problem and widespread housing foreclosures was already an issue in the early spring. But few predicted the collapse of great financial houses just eight weeks before voters were due to go to the polls. Never before in US history had such a sudden and profound shock to the system struck so close to an election.</p> <p>The crisis brought out the greatest vulnerabilities of the Republicans. Even former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan testified that he had been blinkered by ideology. With Reaganite conservatism dishonoured, McCain was cornered into half-denying his beliefs.</p> <p>During the congressional debate over the bail-out of the banks, Obama adopted a posture of dignified caution. McCain, however, threw himself into the maelstrom without any plan. The rightwing members of the House of Representatives, contemptuous of McCain and tired of making excuses for the Bush White House, voted it down - demolishing McCain's claim to experience, stability and effectiveness. The bail-out was eventually passed, but he did not recover.</p> <p>McCain desperately elevated Joe the Plumber as the voice of the people against Obama's \"socialism\". Joe was a ghost of Republican campaigns past, the stalwart member of Nixon's \"silent majority\", the \"Reagan Democrat\". But the symbol was an atavism; the reality was a guy on the make seeking to own a business and avoid taxes. Once the spotlight focused on him, he hired an agent to hustle commercial endorsements and a book deal. Just as McCain's campaign has been an extended seance trying to call forth Reagan, he found himself at a rally summoning Joe the Plumber, who wasn't there. \"You're all Joe the Plumber!\" yelled McCain in frustration.</p> <p>McCain long despised Bush, then embraced him and, by the campaign's end, condemned him. One thing he has not done is to reflect on his own incoherence and whether it represents more than the vicissitudes of ambition. Bush, too, envisioned himself as Reagan's true son. In his campaign McCain has acted as though he had only to repeat magical phrases and symbols that lifted Republicans into the White House to restore the natural order.</p> <p>Now, certain factors that have dominated US politics for 40 years seem destined to recede to the far corners. In economics, supply-side panaceas and deregulation created the worst crisis since the Great Depression, requiring a conservative Republican administration to part-nationalise banks, something unimaginable under any Democratic administration. In foreign policy, neoconservatism led to the morass in Iraq and Afghanistan while undermining the western alliance. In social policy, the evangelical right battered science, the separation of church and state, and the right to privacy. Finally, the conservative principle of limited government has become a watchword for incompetence, cronyism, corruption, hypocrisy, and contempt for the rule of law.</p> <p>Obama may still be a largely unknown quantity, but the judgment will be made about the known. The election will determine more than the identity of the president. It will decide whether one era is to end and another will begin.</p> <p>\u2022 Sidney Blumenthal is a former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Senator Hillary Clinton and author of The Strange Death of Republican America <br><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Is it compulsory for golf to enhance the CV of a US president? John McCain remembers to tell how he \"hit a mean ball\" at naval college, and only as the election campaign hotted up, we're told, did Barack Obama suspend his \"seriously committed\" golf lessons with his Springfield club pro. Another source announces that George W Bush has begun to beat his father, even as the 84-year-old 41st president is now playing off the ladies' tee. </p> <p>The old game has been, you might say, par for the course down the last century and beyond with as many as 15 of George W's 20 most recent predecessors boasting a devotion to a pastime which, I suppose, plays well with party strategists looking for an uncontroversial photo-call activity extolling good manners and trad values. Of the sacrilegious quintet, William Taft, in office between 1909 and 1913, would have struggled to swing a club round his 24-stone girth; Herbert Hoover (1929-33) was an angler (\"All men are equal before a fish\"); Harry Truman (1945-53) bravely berated golf's \"country-club tweedy snobs\"; Jimmy Carter (1977-81) thought the same and Calvin Coolidge (1923-29) asked: \"What remotely is the point in chasing a little white ball around a large green field for half a day?\"</p> <p>The two most fabled Democrat presidents, Franklin D Roosevelt (1933-45) and John F Kennedy (1961-63) both loved the game as young men, though each had to give up playing - the former, of course, being stricken with polio, the latter - said by Alistair Cooke to have had \"the most beautifully rhythmic and composed of swings\" - due to severe back problems. A trio over whom the game's more prissy guardians of etiquette continue to tut-tut are Democrats Lyndon Johnson (1963-69) and Bill Clinton (1993-2000), who would both, by all accounts, rely on charitable \"unseeing\" opponents as they littered their rounds with gimmes and free-shot \"mulligans\" as if they were an everyday part of the game and, similarly, the Republican Richard Nixon (1969-74), whose already suspect integrity was convincingly exposed in the autobiography of leading US pro Sam Snead when the player bitterly accused the president, during a pro-am tournament, of \"smugly throwing a new ball out of a thicket, over the trees on to the fairway\". Not only a cheat, said Sam, Nixon was, as well, \"a joyless player whose swing looked as if he was beating the dust out of a floor rug.\"</p> <p>The golf of Nixon's vice-president, Spiro Agnew, made him a more a lovable figure of fun for its zigzag wildness off the tee. As comic Bob Hope had it: \"At least Spiro can't cheat on his score, he just has to look back down the fairway and count the wounded - last time I played with him he hit a birdie, an eagle, a moose, an elk, and a mason.\"</p> <p>Nixon's Republican mentor, Dwight D Eisenhower (1953-61), was unquestionably the most obsessed presidential golf nut of all, happily confessing - again to this newspaper's Alistair Cooke - that during serious Oval Office briefing sessions on the deployment of Soviet troops, \"my mind would be full of the far more worrying problems of the hook which was upsetting my swing\". During his two terms someone estimated that Eisenhower played over 800 18-hole rounds, 53 of them at Georgia's Augusta National, where he set up an auxiliary \"red telephone\" cabinet room above the pro's shop. All of two decades later, from that same emergency cabinet room at Augusta, another keen Republican golfer, Ronald Reagan (1981-89) actually did issue the orders for the invasion of Grenada in 1983.</p> <p>I fancy, however, that fisherman Hoover was far more spot-on with his pronouncement: \"Next to religion, baseball has a greater impact on the hearts and minds of the American people than any other institution.\" With his populist nous, old ham Reagan would almost daily repeat to anyone listening that, to him, by far most fond and memorable of his Hollywood roles remained the Warner Bros biopic of the legendary \"one-time-lush-saved-to-win-the-1926-World-Series-through-the-love-and-devotion-of-all-American-blonde-Doris-Day\" - namely reformed Cardinals vet pitcher, Grover \"Ol' Pete\" Alexander, in 1952's The Winning Team.</p> <p>On his watch, Reagan never missed pitching the first ball on the baseball season's April opening day. Nor, come to that, did George W, once joint-owner, don't forget, of the Texas Rangers. In all, in 98 Aprils 15 presidents have winged down the opening April onion on 65 occasions. The inaugurator was roly-poly Taft, on an inspired whim at Washington's National Park in 1910 - \"a faultless delivery with his trusty right arm and the virgin sphere scudded across the diamond, true as a die to the pitcher's box,\" swooningly whooped the Post next morning. Hail to the Chief, to be sure.</p>",
  "<h2>Ed Pilkington in Brooklyn, New York</h2> <p>A collective fever, marked by flu-like symptoms ranging from clammy palms to night sweats and a permanent low-level nausea, seems to have settled over liberal America and it shows no sign of dissipating unless and until Barack Obama's victory is beyond the slightest doubt.</p> <p>The outbreak of shared agony is on vivid display outside the food co-op in Park Slope, Brooklyn. If New York city epitomises liberal America; and if Park Slope, a neighbourhood of Brooklyn heavily peopled by writers, artists and other creative souls, epitomises left-leaning New York; then the co-op epitomises left-leaning Park Slope.</p> <p>The supermarket is owned entirely by its customers: to shop there you have to belong to the management cooperative. Every customer pledges to work unpaid for three hours a month, running the tills, stocking the shelves, doing the inventory. In return they all have a stake in the company and are able to buy environmentally-sound, organic produce grown locally and for a fraction of the price charged by the big chains.</p> <p>With such a rationale, it is hardly surprising that Republicans and John McCain supporters are conspicuous by their absence. This is aisle-to-aisle Obama country.</p> <p>Alex Holt had just completed his shift on the checkout counter. \"I was wearing an Obama badge on my jacket, and I wondered to myself what would happen if I put on a McCain pin. I was tempted to do it as a social experiment,\" he said.</p> <p>Most shoppers/workers described their state as being somewhere between excitement that Obama might be about to win, and uncontrollable anxiety that the Democratic cause was about to be ravaged once again.</p> <p>\"Everyone's saying it's fine, but I'm still worried,\" said Tamara. \"I'm worried about all the ignorant people - I don't mean that pejoratively, I mean uninformed people - who are out there and who will swing it away from Obama.\"</p> <p>Lascelles Aboagye, who moved a few years ago from Park Slope out to Long Island and now travels 20 miles to shop at the co-op, sees possible trickery ahead. \"I don't take anything for granted - anything can happen. This is America: people can steal the election even if you win it fair and square.\"</p> <p>A similar combination of apprehension and bitter resignation has been reported in liberal population centres across the US, from the coastal bastions of New York and California to oases such as Ann Arbor in Michigan and Austin in Texas. The experience of winning the popular vote but losing the election in 2000, amid the surreal dispute over Florida's hanging chads and the casting vote of the conservative-dominated supreme court judges, left many liberals shellshocked.</p> <p>Then when John Kerry lost in 2004, amid a close result in Ohio which many left-leaning Americans are convinced was manipulated, the sense of disbelief hardened into cynicism. \"I remember painfully vividly what it was like sitting through election night in 2000,\" said Josh Rabinowitz, a music director in Park Slope. \"Going through that whole craziness was traumatic, then Kerry happened and that reinforced a sense of hopelessness.\"</p> <p>This year people tell Rabinowitz they feel optimistic about an Obama victory, but that doesn't make him feel less queasy. He soothes himself by obsessive monitoring of the left-inclined cable news channel, MSNBC, and by eating and drinking. \"Every time I get stressed out I eat my kids' Halloween candy.\"</p> <p>Exceptional times create exceptional coping mechanisms. One Park Slope food co-op member said a man in her block of apartments had stopped shaving until victory day; his beard was already long and bushy. Elsewhere across the liberal heartlands, a woman from Denver was reported to have put her love life on hold until the Colorado result came in, while a psychotherapist from Manhattan's Upper West Side said about 90% of her patients were raising electoral fears in their therapy sessions.</p> <p>Park Slope's backing for Obama was first evidenced in the primaries, when the neighbourhood bucked the local trend and voted 55% for the senator for Illinois to 45% for New York's Hillary Clinton. The area boasts an unnaturally high quotient of artists, which perhaps helps explain the tendency. The novelist couples Paul Auster and Siri Hustvedt and Jonathan Safran Foer and Nicole Krauss live here, as do actors Paul Bettany and Maggie Gyllenhaal.</p> <p>Republican supporters are so rare in the Slope that when one couple put McCain 08 placards in their garden, they attracted such attention that the New York Times were drawn to publish an article on them under the headline: \"An outpost in the blue sea of Brooklyn.\"</p> <p>Local clothes stores have placed Obama masks over all their mannequins. One Park Slope hair salon offers \"Updos for Obama\" - hair-styling in the fashion of Sarah Palin, but with all proceeds from the $75 groom going to the Democratic candidate's campaign.</p> <p>With nervous energy running so high, volunteering for the Obama cause is at record levels. Rabinowitz had never participated in or contributed towards a political campaign in his life. \"I've been pretty apathetic in terms of politics,\" he said. But last month he gathered a team of friends and organised a fundraiser that generated $153,000 for the Obama campaign. This weekend he and his family were in Pennsylvania knocking on doors to help get out the vote in that battleground state.</p> <p>Jason D'Angelo, walking home with his weekly shopping from the food co-op, is another Park Slope resident who has found himself becoming politically active for the first time. He was preparing to spend the afternoon phone banking from his living room. \"If you are doing something about it, you feel a lot better,\" he said. \"The worse thing would be to wake up on Wednesday morning and realise the horror has happened all over again.\"</p> <h2>Paul Harris in Orange, Texas</h2> <p>The man did not want to stop and chat or give his name. But he was willing to explain the one, simple reason why he was planning to cast his vote for John McCain. \"I am not for socialism. Let's just put it at that way,\" he snapped and then stalked angrily into the local Wal-Mart in the small town of Orange, deep in the heart of Red State America.</p> <p>Such sentiments are not uncommon on the streets of Texas's suburbs and small towns. As America - if polls are to be believed - stands on the edge of electing Barack Obama, the mood of the Republican heartland is not a good one. There is anger and some fear at the end of eight years of Republican control of the White House. </p> <p>Much of that is stoked by conservative talk radio. Yesterday morning the Texan airwaves were full of ultra-conservative pundits predicting a socialist takeover of America, the \"nationalisation\" of the healthcare industry and warning that American business would be legislated and unionised to death. \"It's going to be a different world,\" warned talkshow host Glenn Beck on one broadcast. </p> <p>Despite the prospect of America's first black president, the talk is far more about economics than race. For many Republicans, especially in diehard areas such as Texas, much of that debate has been framed around the old buzzwords of socialism and even Marxism. The traditional Republican attacks of portraying Democrats as too willing to spend and too eager to tax are dominating the discussion. </p> <p>That message certainly seems to have struck a chord in Orange. Tucked away in the far south-eastern corner of the state, Orange is solidly Republican when it comes to picking presidents. In 2004 it voted for President George Bush over Democratic challenger John Kerry by 64% to 36%. Even in the wildest dreams of Democratic strategists, Obama is not going to overcome that 28% gap.</p> <p>Standing next to his pick-up truck construction business worker Will Clarke, 52, said he feared Obama would raise his taxes. He saw Obama as an old fashioned liberal Democrat who wanted to take money out of wallets and put it to use in government projects. </p> <p>\"I am worried. Yes, I am. What he wants to do does sound a little like socialism to me,\" he said. \"Obama is one of those politicians who wants to increase government spending. Joe the plumber got it right.\"</p> <p>There is little doubt that \"Joe the plumber\" is a famous name here, fulfilling the McCain campaign's fervent hope. The Ohio plumber, Joe Wurzelbacher, has been adopted as a campaign totem by the Republicans after publicly confronting Obama, taking him to task over his tax policy on a campaign swing through his home state. </p> <p>Now Wurzelbacher campaigns on the stump with McCain. He is meant to symbolise the \"ordinary Joe\" of America's heartland. And in Orange, the Texas version of Joe in the shape of Clarke is solidly for McCain, even as he understands that Obama will likely be the next resident of the White House. \"I am voting for McCain. I have no doubt about that,\" he said.</p> <p>But much of the Republican anger was directed at President Bush not Obama. \"Bush is just about the sorriest president that we ever had. Bush has ruined this country,\" said RC Fletcher as he shopped for groceries. Fletcher, an elderly white veteran of the Korean war, said he hoped McCain beats Obama. \"I like McCain. I want him to edge it,\" he said. But he added that he had no real problems if that did not happen. \"I think Obama is a smart guy. How could he mess it up more than Bush?\"</p> <p>The other main line of attack in recent weeks from the McCain campaign has been to lambast Obama as lacking experience in foreign affairs. He has been shown as too willing to talk to America's enemies and sit down with potentially hostile governments such as Iran, Cuba and Venezuela. Among many Republicans those arguments have resonated. Texas is a place where a muscular sense of patriotism comes with the territory. It is the home of the cowboy, and even the Bush presidency has not entirely tarnished the idea of translating those ideals into the White House. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Obama, a Chicago liberal with an academic style of lofty rhetoric, is seen as someone who will make America weak. \"He's just a talker. He talks real well but that is not enough. I think he could make America a lot weaker with other countries,\" said Kenneth Brashears, 75.</p> <p>Brashears was always likely to vote for McCain. He served with a relative of McCain's in the navy during Vietnam, and both were under the command of McCain's father. \"McCain policy. He's got more experience. He's got the guts for it,\" he said. </p> <p>That sentiment was echoed by Clarke. He felt that Obama would reduce American power. That is a powerful image at a moment of national crisis. Though America remains the world's only superpower, the prospect of a rising China is on everyone's minds, even in far-flung rural Texas. \"America will be weaker in the world under Obama. He won't look after America's interests. Or at least not like McCain would,\" said Clarke.</p> <p>There is little doubt which way Orange will vote on election day. McCain will win big here. But, among some Republicans, there are signs that Obama might do better than Kerry did. Cradling her child as she shopped at Wal-Mart, Teresa Young, a 36-year-old housewife, said she was probably going to vote for Obama. </p> <p>\"I like him. That is very unusual for me and my family to like a Democrat,\" she said. </p> <p>Her main concern was the struggle to make ends meet. To her ears increasing government spending and universal healthcare sounded like a lifeline, not the spectre of a socialist takeover. \"We would usually vote for McCain, I guess. But right now Obama is more in tune with the issues I care about.\"</p>",
  "<p>The most senior Chinese negotiator to visit the breakaway island of Taiwan in 60 years arrived to a warm official welcome in the capital Taipei yesterday, but faces popular protests as he discusses closer ties with the mainland.</p> <p>The relationship between China and Taipei has thawed since the election of Ma Ying-jeou as Taiwan's president in the spring. China's Communist rulers, who claim the island as sovereign territory and have threatened war should Taiwan's leaders attempt to formalise its independence, have reciprocated this warm feeling in an attempt to reduce the chances of conflict.</p> <p>\"The step is not easy and is a crystallisation of the joint efforts of many compatriots across the strait,\" Chen said, according to Xinhua, mainland China's state-run news agency. </p> <p>But tensions remain and thousands of police guarded the airport for the arrival of Chen Yunlin, China's top negotiator on Taiwan. Nets and barbed wire were erected outside his hotel as a pro-independence group promised NT$1,000 (\u00a319) to anyone who could hit his body with eggs and NT$10,000 to those who hit his face.</p> <p>A convoy of about two dozen taxis cruised through the streets as Chen arrived, blaring their horns and using loudspeakers to broadcast anti-China slogans. Last month protesters in southern Taiwan pushed Chen's deputy, Zhang Mingqing, to the ground as he visited a temple on an informal visit.</p> <p>Despite the hostile reception, the working groups reached a tentative agreement yesterday to sign agreements on direct passenger flights, cargo flights and cargo shipping.</p> <p>Chen is the most senior Chinese official to set foot on Taiwan since the end of the civil war in 1949, when defeated Nationalists fled there. </p> <p>Ma was elected in part because of his pledge to improve relations and help the island benefit from the mainland's economic boom. </p> <p>Shortly after his inauguration negotiating teams for the two governments met in Beijing after a long break, when they signed a deal to begin regular weekend commercial flights between Chinese and Taiwanese cities. But Ma's poll ratings have since plunged as Taiwan's economy falters, and many voters remain nervous at the possibility of greater Chinese influence.</p> <p>Chen is due to meet Chiang Pin-kung, the chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, today when they are expected to sign agreements that increase the charter flight schedule to every other day and open maritime shipping lanes. They are also expected to discuss economic cooperation as a way to fight the global financial crisis.</p> <p>\"It is imperative that the two sides join to help each other to cope,\" Chen said yesterday, according to Xinhua.</p> <p>Raymond Wu, a political risk consultant in Taipei, said: \"People need to have indications that Taiwan is holding firm on its claim to sovereignty.\"</p> <p>The opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP) staged a rally of around 2,000 people outside parliament last night.</p> <p>\"If things keep on like this, Taiwan's economy will irreversibly rely fully on China,\" the DPP chairwoman, Tsai Ing-wen, warned in a letter to newspapers. \"In the not-too-distant future, would Taiwan still keep its sovereignty?\"</p> <p>Chen has also said that China will again offer to give two pandas to Taiwan, an offer that the Beijing government first made in 2005 but which was rejected by the former Taiwanese president. Ma has indicated he would accept the pandas.</p>",
  "<p>Just a few hours to go now, and there is nothing to do but watch and wait. So much symbolism crammed into just one seismic event. The hopes of many millions. That said, it's time to think of the practicalities, and one man who will be doing just that is Sir Nigel Sheinwald, British ambassador in the US - for the word from the Obama camp seems to be that a new Democratic administration would press to have him replaced once it has settled into the White House. Sir Nigel's not entirely flattering portrait of Obama - \"aloof, insensitive\", \"decidedly liberal\", a man finding his feet who then \"got diverted by his presidential ambitions\" - was \"leaked\" to the press. This enraged the Obama camp, who noted that no similar paper on McCain's possible limitations had found its way into the public domain. Obama talks a lot about the \"better angels\", but his people are already making it clear to Labour types here that they haven't forgotten the ambassador's unhelpful contribution to this long-running, titanic struggle.

Don't get comfy.</p> <p>\u2022 What will it all mean for the Middle East, wonders the world-famous, staggeringly well-paid envoy for the region.

However, on that occasion she was beaten by Maryline Blackburn, who has a darker complexion than Obama.\" London. 2008.</p> <p>\u2022 No more fearsome sight, perhaps, than MPs on the warpath; and thus will the authorities at Heathrow be somewhat concerned to see 41 have signed an early-day motion tabled by John Grogan MP, the honourable member for Selby. He has been busy: for while demanding the abandonment of a third runway, he has also found time to submit a letter demanding the retention of flights from Heathrow to Leeds Bradford airport. The flight is in danger because there is no room at Heathrow. They could use the M4.</p> <p>\u2022 The Conservatives are better because they are united, said Dave, and the spirit of unanimity is evident in Norfolk, where Daniel Cox, the county council leader and Wymondham county cou ncillor, has been deselected. \"Put a Tory on the spit to roast, and you will always find a dozen other Tories to turn the handle,\" says David Fletcher, himself a Tory councillor, writing in the Eastern Daily Press. It's only a dozen now.

  "<p>Chicago is bracing itself for a huge and possibly chaotic street party as more than a million people are expected to descend on the city centre tonight in anticipation of a victory for Democratic presidential hopeful, Barack Obama.</p> <p>Obama, who lives in the city, has planned a public party in Grant Park which is in the downtown area. The campaign issued more than 70,000 tickets for the event but they were sold out in a matter of hours. Nonetheless, huge numbers are expected to come into the city anyway, prompting a security clampdown, concern about public safety and some businesses to send employees home early.</p> <p>\"It's going to be surprising,\" mayor Richard Daley told the Chicago Tribune. \"There are going to be a lot of people who want to come down to celebrate. We hope it's a million or more - that's realistic. It's going to be wonderful. Only the private event is ticket[ed]. You can be in the park and around it ... You think I'm nuts? You think I'm not going to invite people down? The mayor's not going to tell anybody not to come to this celebration. It's a historic event.

Last Friday police superintendent Jody Weis warned: \"We can't have foolishness. We can't have mischief.\" </p> <p>Last week helicopters flew low over Hutchinson Field, the part of Grant Park where the rally will take place, while police scoured rooftops on downtown buildings. All Chicago police officers have had leave cancelled for the night and firefighters have been asked to have their personal equipment handy at home. </p> <p>\"We expect a good, supportive crowd, and we expect it to be a happy occasion,\" Obama's campaign manager, David Axelrod, said. \"Whatever the result, we don't expect trouble.\"</p> <p>Even the coastguard will patrol in Burnham Harbor and on Lake Michigan, which borders the park. With traffic expected to be snarled and parking banned in large areas of the city, the decision to stage an event of this scale has proved controversial. A Chicago Tribune website poll asking whether the rally is a good idea showed the city split, with 52% in favour and 48% opposed.</p> <p>McCain's operatives have ridiculed Obama's event as typically ostentatious and self-aggrandising. \"I don't know if he is planning another Berlin moment, but we're having what will be a great victory night celebration with a lot of supporters,\" said campaign spokesman Brian Rogers, referring to the throngs that turned up to greet Obama in when he visited Europe in July.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339274038\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1898265898_campaign-analysis-2-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Sometimes it felt as if this day would never come. But today, the 21 long months of the 2008 presidential campaign, a saga packed with higher drama than any contest in living memory, finally comes down to a straight choice. By tonight, perhaps as many as 140 million Americans will have stepped inside a polling both, pulled back the curtain and made a quiet, private decision that will determine the course of the United States - and so the world - for the next four years.</p> <p>The two candidates have tried to frame that choice in their own terms. For Barack Obama, it has been the same, perennial pitch that challengers have made since the dawn of democratic politics: the future versus the past, change versus more of the same.</p> <p>Those were the battle lines he drew first against Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries, and the lines he was drawing even in the final lap of campaigning yesterday, as he tried to absorb the news of his grandmother's death and go ahead with rallies in Florida, North Carolina and Virginia: that the US could choose a new path with him, or a continuation of the Bush era with John McCain.</p> <p>McCain's pitch has never been quite as clear. At first, he suggested that Americans would be deciding between an experienced warrior and an unseasoned novice. But experience became a hard message to sell once McCain had picked Sarah Palin, governor of Alaska for just 20 months, as his running mate. So he fell back on the traditional Republican arguments: weak vs strong abroad, big vs small government at home.</p> <p>But those lines have grown blurred, not least because McCain has been the standard bearer of the party that blurred them. It's not easy to preach the message of small government when a Republican president has just spent $700bn on a partial nationalisation of the US banking system.</p> <p>McCain fuzzed the lines himself, too, with a daily barrage of different messages cumulatively suggesting that the choice was between an all-American war hero and a strange, unrooted, quasi-celebrity socialist with dodgy friends and dubious loyalties.</p> <p>In the final push, hitting seven cities in seven states yesterday, McCain found a focus at last. As if taking a leaf from the Tory playbook of 1992, he warned of a tax bombshell about to land on hard-working Americans. At every stop he has been invoking his human prop, Joe the Plumber, the everyman who, he warns, would pay more tax under Obama.</p> <p>But the choice today is not only as the candidates have framed it, even in their final 30-second TV ads: one from Obama taunting McCain for winning the endorsement of Dick Cheney (\"Boy, did he earn it\") and a Republican ad featuring the Democratic candidate's former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, bellowing \"God Damn America\". The choice is also made up of elements the candidates don't always articulate explicitly. For these two men have fundamentally different attitudes to the rest of the world.</p> <p>Obama urges engagement and dialogue \"with our enemies as well as our friends\". He stresses the importance of restoring America's standing abroad. McCain does not say so directly, but he casts the rest of the world as an essentially hostile arena, a vast \"Out There\", full of menaces that America has to stare down. In a spirited stump speech - \"The Mac is back!\" - delivered in Springfield, Virginia at the weekend, the only references to the world beyond US shores were to dictators, and to Obama's refusal to use the word \"victory\" when discussing American involvement in Iraq.</p> <p>And so McCain inadvertently confirms Obama's presentation of him as the would-be bringer of a third Bush term. For McCain reveals no difference from the president in his view of the world. In his choice of advisers, in his disdain for diplomacy - always dismissed as glorified appeasement - he makes clear that, when it comes to foreign policy, today's choice really is between change and more of the same.</p> <p>Obama says that's true of economics too, that McCain represents a continuation of the same \"on-your-own\" philosophy that has prevailed these last eight years. McCain insists that is unfair, that he has criticised Bush for letting spending get too high. But he does not offer a substantial alternative. In a late night rally at a high-school sports ground in Glen Allen, Virginia, Palin won cheers when she promised a \"pro-growth plan\" - but she never explained what this plan might include.</p> <p>So, though they could not admit it during these tough times, the Republicans are indeed offering the same Bush formula of low taxes and unfettered free markets. On Saturday, Palin even repeated the old Reagan bromide, that \"government is the problem, not the solution\". Today Americans will have to decide whether that's true - or whether they are desperate for government to role up its sleeves and help them out.</p> <p>Of course, there are other choices on offer, including one between America's demographic future and its past. Obama is the product of a mixed background, like increasing numbers of Americans. The US future, says one analyst, is not black or white, but brown, and Obama embodies that. McCain and party, meanwhile, still look - Palin apart - like a country club: old guys in blazers at the top, and white faces all around.</p> <p>Finally, Americans can see in today's vote a choice between two different ways of doing politics - and not only between the sleek efficiency of the Obama machine and the often chaotic performance of the McCain team. For it is, in part, a referendum on a style of electioneering that has dominated ever since Richard Nixon ran for Congress in 1946 suggesting his opponent was not \"one of us\". McCain, who once disdained this brand of cultural warfare, in which any Democrat is cast as unpatriotic, elitist and less than a true American, has embraced it in 2008.</p> <p>Whether it's his allies stressing Obama's middle name of Hussein, or Palin praising \"pro-America\" parts of the country, or McCain himself closing his speeches by declaring \"I'm an American\", as if his opponent is not, this year's Republican effort has been every bit as dirty as those of the past.</p> <p>If voters reject McCain today they will also be rejecting that McCarthyite brand of politics, embracing Obama's insistence that, at a time when the problems facing America are so big, it makes no sense that its politics are so small.</p> <p>This is what stands before Americans today. They can decide to see the world in a new light, full of potential partners as well as enemies, or remain in the Bush crouch of permanent warfare. They can decide it's time to address the gravest questions, or run from them, retreating into the same cultural spats that have dominated for at least 40 years. After 21 months of candidates debating and pundits yammering, it's time for the American people to speak.</p>",
  "<p>Democrats are increasingly confident that the US congressional election today will see them extend their majority in the House of Representatives and reduce the Republicans in the Senate to an ineffective rump. Polls yesterday suggest that the Democrats stand to take not only the White House, but will win seven or eight more seats in the Senate, where they already hold 51 of the 100 seats.</p> <p>A Congressional victory on that scale would help Barack Obama to avoid the fate of some of his predecessors, whose legislative plans have often been blocked by hostile Republicans.</p> <p>The Democrats, fighting the congressional race with almost as much intensity as the White House battle, poured millions of dollars into the campaign at the weekend. Obama diverted some of his funds into key Senate and House races in places such as Georgia. Democrats in Senate races had spent more than $67m, against $33.7m by the Republican candidates, as of the end of last week.</p> <p>Despite Congress reaching levels of unpopularity that rival that of President George Bush, voters surveyed by pollsters blamed the economic crisis on Republicans, rather than Democrats, who seem likely to hang on to the gains they achieved in the 2006 mid-term elections. The Democrats may fall just short of the 60 Senate seats needed to prevent the Republicans mounting legislation-blocking tactics such as filibustering.</p> <p>Larry Sabato, director of the centre for politics at the University of Virginia, said the Democrats should not become hung up on the 60 figure, and that it would not matter if they failed to reach it. \"The Republicans who are left are going to be irrelevant for the first year of the Obama administration. The Republicans will not have a major role to play,\" he said.</p> <p>He said the concentration on reaching the 60 mark was overdone, because some moderate Republican senators would probably vote with the Democrats, or face trouble being re-elected.</p> <p>Another potential problem facing a Republican rump, according to the political scientists Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal, is that it could be more conservative than the existing Republican Senate group. According to their analysis, the Republicans most at risk of losing their seat are mainly those on the more moderate wing. A more rightwing Senate grouping might find it harder to attract voters from the centre ground in the congressional mid-term elections in 2010.</p> <p>The three Senate seats most likely to switch from the Republicans to the Democrats today are Virginia, New Mexico and Colorado. Others the Democrats hope to take include Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Oregon.</p> <p>One of the biggest victims of a Democratic rout in the Senate could be Elizabeth Dole, the conservative senator for North Carolina. Norm Coleman, the Republican incumbent in Minnesota who famously clashed with the British parliamentarian George Galloway at a Senate hearing on Iraq, is facing a close race against the Democratic candidate, the comedian Al Franken.</p> <p>To reach the filibuster-proof 60 seats in the Senate, the Democrats will need to take Georgia, Kentucky or Mississippi. That is mainly why Obama announced last Friday that he would begin advertising in Georgia. The state may prove beyond him, but the big turn-out of African-Americans in the state, attracted by his candidacy, offers an outside chance of a Senate upset.</p> <p>In the races for the House of Representatives, where the Democrats have held control since 2006, the party is expecting to extend its lead by a further 25-plus seats.</p>",
  "<p>Simon Schama's dismissal of departing president George Bush as a loser and his foreign policy as \"hubristic\" (Nowhere man: a farewell to Dubya, all-time loser in presidential history, November 3) is nothing more than a childish whoop of leftwing joy.

  "<p>Lipstick on pitbulls. Tears in New Hampshire. Moose-hunting hockey moms turned shop-till-you-drop $150,000 campaign wardrobe divas. Eighteen million cracks in the glass ceiling.</p> <p>What was billed as the year of the woman in American politics regularly slid into sexism and silliness. But feminists argued yesterday that Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin helped ease the way for a new generation of women.</p> <p>Except, of course, that for all the talk about shattering the proverbial glass ceiling Clinton lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama. Palin, for all the early excitement of her candidacy, morphed into the comedian Tina Fey, was backstabbed by her own campaign staff as a diva gone rogue and could be on her way back to Alaska tomorrow morning.</p> <p>Supporters of both women claim they were victims of sexism, ranging from overweening interest in their wardrobes to unfair suspicion of their policy platforms.</p> <p>Even so, Gloria Steinem sees the campaign as a net plus. \"Clinton's candidacy has made it possible for huge numbers of people to imagine a female head of state,\" she said. \"I always thought it was too early but now there is a change in the molecules in the air so that people can imagine a female head of state. She has also brought large numbers of women into political life.\"</p> <p>The two women followed very different trajectories. Clinton entered the race for the White House as one of the best-funded and well-connected candidates in history. She lost her lofty status as a former first lady and White House favourite to Obama but remade herself along the way into a gritty streetfighting populist.</p> <p>Palin, the maverick mother of five who was hailed as a breath of Arctic fresh air, became the first woman to join a presidential ticket in a generation after Geraldine Ferraro in 1984. She was also the first woman of the right on a national ticket, hailed by Camille Paglia as a new muscular breed of feminist.</p> <p>Michelle Obama, an increasingly popular fixture on the campaign trail, was also seen as inspirational as a deeply engaged spouse, and a new model of first lady.</p> <p>Both Clinton and Palin were lauded for showing their willingess for the fight: Clinton for her determination to fight to the end, Palin for her undented self-confidence in the face of multiple fiascos.</p> <p>Clinton did not fully embrace the historic nature of her candidacy until her concession speech in June, when she talked about cracks in the glass ceiling.</p> <p>However, gender was a constant on the landscape. In New Hampshire, a moment of weakness, when Clinton came close to tears, was endlessly dissected. Women's groups accused media commentators of unfair treatment.</p> <p>But Steinem argues that even the sexist heckling at Clinton rallies and the negative treatment from cable television hosts had had a positive effect in opening the eyes of a younger generation of women to sexism. \"Lots of women in their 20s and 30s were shocked and appalled,\" said Steinem. \"It awoke them to a problem that they thought had been solved.\"</p> <p>Palin, by campaigning with infant in tow, may have helped break down one of the most enduring prejudices against mothers in the workplace. \"Nobody after Palin is going to say a woman should be home with her children,\" said Barbara Ehrenreich. \"Here is a woman with a newborn special needs baby and a daughter in a terrible crisis and out on the campaign trail, but we are not going to get that line any more - probably because the people likely to say that are Republican.\"</p> <p>Republicans acknowledge that it is unlikely John McCain would have chosen Palin without Clinton having been a candidate in the first place. Palin herself suggested her candidacy would help make up for Clinton being passed over as a vice-presidential candidate for Joe Biden. \"It was rightly noted in Denver this week that Hillary left 18m cracks in the highest, hardest glass ceiling in America,\" Palin said. \"But it turns out the women of America aren't finished yet, and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all.\"</p> <p>But Palin also provoked a ferocious backlash from leftwing and liberal women. One hockey mom, swathed in a team jersey, went to the extent of making a video of herself singing an aria, to the tune of Evita: \"Don't speak for me, Sarah Palin.\"</p> <p>At the very least, Clinton and Palin forced Americans to get used to the idea of seeing and hearing women at national debates and at mass rallies.</p> <p>That has yet to pan out this election year. The Centre for American Women and Politics reports that fewer women are running for Congress and elected state office than in other years.</p> <p>But Marie Wilson, the director of the White House project which trains women for leadership, argues that Clinton's candidacy had already forced Democrats to be more responsive to the concerns of women voters. \"For the first time in at least a decade, women are talked about, women voters are sought after with a different kind of passion and purpose than just getting us to vote. Everyone realises that we are a force.\"</p>",
  "<p>As two years of campaigning draw to a close, the Grateful Dead's iconic lyric \"What a long, strange trip it's been\" comes to mind. Here are eight indelible moments that helped make the 2008 election the most memorable in modern US history:</p> <p>1<strong> McCain opens mouth, inserts foot</strong></p> <p>When McCain decided that the day of Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy filing was a good time to declare that \"the fundamentals of our economy are strong\". Obama pounced, depicting his rival as out of touch.</p> <p>2 <strong>The White House bail-out showdown</strong></p> <p>During a White House meeting the plan was to get both nominees backing the treasury department's plan to mend the markets. But McCain was shockingly silent, and he took the blame when the first bail-out failed in Congress.</p> <p>3 <strong>Viral video takes off</strong></p> <p>This was the year of YouTube politics, with every day bringing another clever satire or instant attack advert that ricocheted around the web before either campaign knew how to respond.</p> <p>4 <strong>Obama's blunder</strong></p> <p>Obama stumbled in April when he told fundraisers in wealthy San Francisco that smalltown Americans \"cling to guns and religion\" to cope with economic hardship. The remark caused incalculable damage with working-class voters.</p> <p>5 <strong>Clinton opens mouth, inserts foot</strong></p> <p>Bill Clinton blew the lid off the race issue in January by comparing Obama to Jesse Jackson, a former candidate. Pundits and some voters heard veiled racism in Clinton's words, and a national dialogue on race relations officially began.</p> <p>6 <strong>Matchmaking for a maverick</strong></p> <p>Conservatives sent McCain a message: pick a pro-abortion running mate and you are doomed. Joe Lieberman and Tom Ridge, his top two choices, were then passed over for Sarah Palin. As her lack of readiness dragged down poll numbers, some in his camp were regretting the matchmaking.</p> <p>7 <strong>Joe has a question</strong></p> <p>And it sounded innocent at first. \"Your new tax plan's going to tax me more, isn't it?\" an Ohio plumber asked Obama during a campaign stop. The answer was no, as it turned out, but Obama's reference to spreading wealth inspired McCain to label him a socialist, making Joe the Plumber a household name.</p> <p>8 <strong>A Palin shopping spree</strong></p> <p>Sarah Palin sold herself to voters as an unpretentious hockey mom. So imagine the country's surprise when Republican campaign finance reports revealed $150,000 in monthly wardrobe bills. Suddenly the small-town Palin looked like a big-time faker.</p>",

  "<p>Nothing creates such political passions as the question of who goes to university. For the right, attempts to increase the proportion from lower socioeconomic backgrounds suggest social engineering and dilution of academic standards. For the left, middle-class dominance of universities - or at least the elite ones, including Oxford, Cambridge and some other members of the 20-strong Russell Group - is an indefensible example of social injustice, passing privilege down the generations. State schools complain that posh universities turn their pupils down because they've got the wrong accents; fee-charging schools complain that their kids are rejected for applicants with inferior qualifications.</p> <p>It is class warfare in its rawest form. As the current term began, it was stirred by Lord (Chris) Patten, chancellor of Oxford and a former Tory minister, who said the university was \"not a social security office\"; John Denham, the universities secretary, replied that Patten was defending social elitism.</p> <p>It is the kind of thing that needs a UN peacekeeping force. That is roughly the role assigned to Professor Sir Martin Harris, head of the Office for Fair Access (Offa). I first met Harris nearly 30 years ago, when he was at Salford University, which had just been hit by severe funding cuts. He struck me then as lean, hungry and very, very angry. Now, at 64, after two university vice-chancellorships, he is thicker set, better fed and much calmer. Some wish he'd be less calm and, as the Americans say, kick a bit of ass. \"His heart is in the right place, but he's not the most incisive individual in the world,\" was the assessment of one recent (non-Russell Group) vice-chancellor. \"He hasn't disturbed the scorers.\"</p> <p>Offa was the price Labour backbenchers extracted for supporting the legislation introducing top-up fees, and was widely known as Oftoff - though, as Harris rather huffily points out, nobody calls it that now. His appointment didn't please either side in the class struggle. The left hoped for somebody more independent than an insider from the academic bureaucracy who was chairman of the committee of vice-chancellors and principals (now Universities UK). The right's view was summed up by Tory MP John Maples, who described Harris as \"a real, old, hoary left-winger\" whom the government had found in \"some intellectual Jurassic Park\".</p> <p>Harris, a Labour election agent in the 1960s, who left the party only when he became vice-chancellor of Essex in 1987 (because the local MPs were Tories, he says), had indeed quoted a senior civil servant who described him as \"resolutely old Labour\". In the same speech, he said \"class underlies almost all the inequalities and unfairnesses in our system\". The Labour party is in his blood, his maternal grandparents being Christian socialists, his father a Welsh socialist. He remains a vehement opponent of the 11-plus and sent his children to Manchester comprehensives. Nobody who knows him doubts his commitment to social justice. </p> <p>So why is there a feeling in some quarters that Offa hasn't been tough enough, that, as a current (again non-Russell Group) vice-chancellor put it, Harris \"has done what was required and nothing else\"? Why do working-class students still account for fewer than 30% of the total, and state school entry to Oxbridge for less than 60%? Why is Oxford likely to miss its target to take 62% from state schools by 2011? Why, although it can impose financial sanctions (or ask the Higher Education Funding Council to do so), has Offa not even issued a final warning to a single university, even though Harris says \"we are in dialogue from time to time\"?</p> <p>Charles Clarke, the education secretary who appointed Harris, says he \"didn't expect dramatic change, but material change over five to seven years\". He wanted somebody trusted within academia, but also committed to widening access to elite universities. \"I didn't look for a campaigner or an advocate,\" Clarke says. \"Rather, I wanted a systems person, somebody who would take a pragmatic rather than a declaratory approach. My impression is that Martin has dealt with the issues of process and procedure. My question - and I'm looking at this from the outside now - is whether this has led to a tick-box approach rather than changing the culture. I think many universities still don't get it. They regard the whole access thing as an imposition by a politically correct government.\"</p> <p>If Harris agrees, he's not letting on. When we meet, I start by quoting another passage from the speech that offended Maples. He had recalled how, from a humble background in Plymouth and a state grammar school, he got to Queen's College, Cambridge, the first member of his family to attend university. \"To be blunt,\" he had said, \"the chance ... would not necessarily be available to a boy or girl of comparable income and from a comparable neighbourhood today.\"<br><strong><br>Improving chances</strong></p> <p>What, at Offa, has he done about it? He doesn't immediately answer but goes back to what he says was his original brief, to ensure top-up fees didn't deter students from impecunious homes. \"The fear that finance alone might discourage the lower income groups has been disproved,\" he says. Government grants and loans, plus bursaries offered by universities from increased fee income, have worked. Harris talks about this at length, implying he saw his role as primarily a defensive one - which, Clarke made clear to me, was not at all how he saw it.</p> <p>Harris continues: \"Now we are left with the much more difficult issue: how do you increase aspiration among families with no experience of higher education? And the issue that has really come to the fore in the last two years is that getting them into university is not good enough. We've got to get them into certain universities, the highly selective ones.\"</p> <p>Harris argues there are many important factors \"not under universities' control\". For example: \"I know an Oxbridge college which spent time and effort trying to recruit in the far north-east. It made six offers, but, in the end, they all went to Durham or Newcastle. Roughly speaking, the further north you go, the more difficult it is to get a young person, no matter how talented, to apply to a university in the south. Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield can pull southerners north, but Exeter can't get applications from Sunderland.\"</p> <p>Another example: a minority of state school pupils in cities attend 11-18 schools. \"The highly selective universities concentrate on subjects such as sciences and modern languages. Look at an 11-16 school in a not particularly favoured area and ask yourself if three sciences or a range of languages are likely to be available.\"</p> <p>This, I suggest to Harris, won't do. Everything depends on what we mean by \"fair access\". Is it fair to compare an applicant who has three Bs at A-level from an inner-city comprehensive with one who has three As from a fee-charging school, having enjoyed home advantages plus intensive school coaching? If the northern working classes shy away from Oxford and Cambridge, is it because they've been told it's fantastically difficult to get in and think these universities are full of toffs? After all, Sutton Trust research showed a third of Oxbridge entrants come from just 100 schools. So perhaps the elite universities should change their definition of \"highly qualified\" and use some kind of quota system - for example, by creating the \"pool of applicants\" from the top 2% or 3% in each school, providing they have B grades at least.</p> <p>Harris listens to all this politely, without quite agreeing or disagreeing. He simply says: \"We are dealing with very complex social factors\", and adds: \"Would it be wise to encourage young people who want to go to a perfectly good local university to go somewhere where they may be less happy and, therefore, do less well? That takes us into talking about the whole nature of British society.\" A quota system, he says, would introduce unfairness in other ways. \"But if you said, should a fixed proportion from each school be motivated to aim for top university entry, then I'm with you.\"</p> <p>When we talk later about Salford, Harris shows he's well aware of what's at stake. He was pro vice-chancellor when, at the height of the early 1980s recession, the Tory government demanded 15% cuts across the university sector. The funding body, then the University Grants Committee (UGC), hardly touched the more established universities, while Salford, with more than 40% cuts, was the most extreme example of what happened to non-traditional, vocational, new universities.</p> <p>\"The cuts,\" says Harris, \"were made in those universities and departments which took people with the weakest A-levels. They were based on input rather than output measures, which was terribly unjust. Some of those who came with weak A-levels did very well. What students achieve at A-level doesn't necessarily tell you what they're going to achieve later.\"</p> <p><strong>Frustrated politician</strong></p> <p>The Salford cuts and the eloquence of Harris's protests were the making of him. He had originally aimed for a political career and, at Cambridge, became Labour club chairman with the intention of building the right base. But marriage and parenthood came early, and he decided politics was incompatible with family life. Having got a first in modern languages, he went instead into university teaching and research, starting with a doctorate in French linguistics and then writing books with titles such as The Evolution of French Syntax. \"So here,\" he says, \"was a frustrated politician and, if you were one of that small minority who actually wanted to go on the faculty board, people would say: yes, please do. There were elections, but I was always unopposed.\"</p> <p>Salford projected him into national academic politics. He was invited to join the UGC because, as Sir Peter Swinnerton-Dyer, then the chairman, recalls, \"we needed a representative of those universities that had been clobbered\". He went on to become vice-chancellor of Essex, then Manchester. His crowning achievement was to prepare the merger of Manchester with its neighbour Umist, creating a northern super-university fit, as some see it, to rival Imperial College in London. He remains in demand for running things and sitting on committees. He has just become president of Clare Hall, Cambridge (which he says doesn't compromise his Offa role because it doesn't have undergraduates), alongside other roles on, for example, the Northwest Development Agency. The Commons public accounts committee, questioning him last month, wondered if this was too many jobs. In fact, the Offa chairmanship is now only two days a week, which was Harris's decision because, he says, \"universities weren't being recalcitrant\".</p> <p>Well, that's his view and perhaps what his critics see as a laidback approach will work. It's too early to tell, but there are some encouraging signs: Cambridge's state school entry was up to 59% from 55% this autumn and total applications for next year are up 12%. Moreover, Denham has now told all universities to give Offa a full account of their admissions policies, though Harris is adamant this doesn't mean - contrary to what Patten thinks - that he, still less the government, will control admissions.</p> <p>\"I haven't worked in the sector for 40 years,\" Harris says, \"without learning that universities have to be persuaded to change their ways. Am I satisfied that those universities that are constantly talked about in the media are making pretty serious efforts with summer schools and so on? Yes, I am. Am I confident they will overcome that complex of social factors we talked about? That is uncertain.\"</p>",

The effect would be a delay in declaring results in key states.</p> <p>With all the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2008/oct/03/uselections.polltracker.obama.mccain\">main polls putting Obama well ahead</a>, political analysts from right and left said they expected him to easily reach the 270 of 538 electoral votes needed to win the presidency, and many predicted a landslide, with him taking 350 or more electoral seats.</p> <p>The Washington-based Pew organisation, one of the most respected pollsters which accurately predicted the vote in 2004, yesterday put Obama on 52% and McCain on 46%. RealClearPolitics, a website that averages out the main polls, put Obama on 51% to McCain's 44%. If the polls are borne out today, he would become the first Democrat since Jimmy Carter in 1976 to win 50% or more of the popular vote.</p> <p>The excitement generated by Obama's candidacy is expected to see between 130 million and 140 million Americans vote, easily eclipsing the 121 million who turned out in 2004.</p> <p>Obama and McCain both began multi-state tours yesterday in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/florida\">Florida</a>, before heading towards their home states today. There was a poignant start to Obama's tour when he learned of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/04/barack-obama-grandmother-madelyn-dunham\">death of his 86-year-old grandmother, Madelyn Payne Dunham</a>, while he was campaigning in Florida. She helped raise him and in a campaign advertisement this year he described her as having \"taught me values straight from the Kansas heartland\".</p> <p>Obama decided to continue with his appearances and later told a rally in Jacksonville, Florida: \"After decades of broken politics in Washington, eight years of failed policies from George Bush and 21 months of a campaign that has taken us from the rocky coast of Maine to the sunshine of California, we are one day away from change in America.\"</p> <p>Obama was unable to avoid providing occasional glimpses throughout the day that he expected to become the 44th president. In a courteous gesture he might not have made if the race was closer, Obama said he wanted to \"congratulate McCain on the great race that he has fought\".</p> <p>Exuding confidence, he told a rally the previous night: \"The last couple of days, I've been just feeling good.\"</p> <p>As polling day nears, he has become more reflective, telling CBS yesterday that he had found the toughest part of the two-year campaign was the rightwing attack on his wife, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/michelleobama\">Michelle</a>. He described this as \"just completely out of bounds\".</p> <p>McCain, at a rally in Tampa, Florida, insisted he could still pull off a surprise win. \"The pundits may not know it and the Democrats may not know it, but the Mac is back. We're going to win this election.\"</p> <p>The Democrats, as well as political analysts, were less sanguine than election officials about trouble-free voting, saying that with 300,000 precincts across the country, there would be problems.</p> <p>Democratic officials complain that in some states Republican election officers are not opening enough booths in areas that are predominantly African-American in the hope that some voters, put off by queues, will go home without voting.</p> <p>Professor Michael McDonald, an election expert at Virginia's George Mason University, said: \"I would not be surprised if we had long lines, potentially keeping polling places open longer on election day.\" He anticipated problems in states that had not allowed early voting in significant numbers, such as Virginia, Pennsylvania and Missouri.</p> <p>The Democrats are outspending the Republicans on final-day advertising by at least two to one. They are also likely to have more staff and volunteers out, with 770 offices nationwide to McCain's 370.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339302134\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Barack Obama lost the emotional anchor of his childhood yesterday, only hours before today's historic election, when the grandmother who raised him died of cancer.</p> <p>Madelyn Dunham, though she was too frail to travel, had tracked her grandson's campaign religiously through cable TV from her Honolulu apartment. She was 86. Obama learned of her death early yesterday morning at Jacksonville in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/florida\">Florida</a> where he had a rally scheduled. He announced the death in a statement issued jointly with his sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng, who had been by Dunham's side.</p> <p>\"It is with great sadness that we announce that our grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, has died peacefully after a battle with cancer,\" the statement said. \"She was the cornerstone of our family, and a woman of extraordinary accomplishment, strength, and humility. She was the person who encouraged and allowed us to take chances.\"</p> <p>Obama had been braced for the possibility the woman whom he credits with raising him might not live to see possibly his proudest moment as he headed into the election in which he is favoured over John McCain. With so much at stake in the final hours before the polls, Obama carried on campaigning last night, telling a crowd in Charlotte, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/northcarolina\">North Carolina</a>: \"She has gone home, and she died peacefully in her sleep with my sister at her side.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339301702\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/11/04/obamagran2.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama poses with his grandparents Stanley Armour and Madelyn Dunham in the 1980s.

They look after their families. They look after their children and their grandchildren.\"</p> <p>News of the death brought immediate expressions of sympathy. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/johnmccain\">McCain</a> offered his condolences to the Obama family in a statement, saying: \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to them as they remember and celebrate the life of someone who had such a profound impact in their lives.\"</p> <p>Obama spoke often on the campaign trail about his grandmother and of his great debt to her. Two weeks ago, the Democrat took a break from campaigning to visit her at her modest apartment block in central Honolulu, after she had fallen and broken her hip. Some had seen the hiatus at such a critical time as a political risk, but Obama said one of his greatest regrets was his failure to have been with his mother when she was dying of ovarian cancer.</p> <p>He also admitted then he was not sure his grandmother would live to see election day. In his memoir, Obama credited Dunham for giving him the stability he might otherwise have lacked, being raised without a father and by a mother who travelled between Hawaii and Indonesia.</p> <p>He returned from Indonesia to live with his grandparents when he was 10, and Dunham enrolled him in the exclusive Punahou school in Hawaii. Obama recalled the sacrifices she made to send him to that school, in his speech accepting the Democratic nomination: \"She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself, so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me.\"</p> <p>Friends had described Dunham, who was originally from Kansas, as an example of strength and determination. She worked her way up from a clerical job to a management position at the Bank of Hawaii. Obama often mentioned her to emphasise his connection to the white Kansas heartland. </p> <p>But he also admitted that his relationship with his white grandmother was complicated. In his landmark speech on race last April, he acknowledged that his grandmother, for all her strengths, had attitudes on race which at times made him cringe.</p> <p>Her death leaves Obama with one remaining link to his childhood: his younger sister, Maya, who lives in Hawaii.</p>"
