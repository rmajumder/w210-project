  "<p>Benny Sithole can be forgiven for thinking himself unlucky. Four years ago, he left his home in southern Mozambique with the clothes on his back and the cellphone number of a childhood friend in his pocket. He was heading for Johannesburg, South Africa, to find work and money. Within two years, he had created a stable business - a fruit and vegetable stall just a few hundred yards from the shack he had made his home. It was a modest enterprise, but he was earning enough to support a mother and two sisters back home. He had also married a South African woman, a Xhosa-speaker named Kate Ntsaluba, and had a wide circle of South African friends.</p> <p>On the afternoon of May 18 2008, some of Sithole's neighbours, among them young men he'd known quite well, drove from their homes him and his wife and every other foreign national in the settlement. After the couple had gone, the invaders looted their shack, distributing its furniture among themselves. Next, they tore down Sithole's fruit and vegetable stall to use for firewood.</p> <p>\"I received no warning,\" Sithole said. \"On the Saturday night, they were the same people they had been since the day I met them. By the time the sun set on Sunday, they had told me I must either leave or die.\" Neither Sithole nor his wife has returned, he for fear of being killed because he is foreign, she because she suspects she will be raped for sharing her bed with a Mozambican.</p> <p>Benny and Kate Sithole are among the tens of thousands of victims of a pogrom, the first to take place in Nelson Mandela's rainbow nation. Several million foreign nationals have poured across South Africa's borders since the end of apartheid, most of them illegally. They have received a mixed welcome from ordinary South Africans and state officials alike. This May, South Africans in shantytowns across the country decided to throw them out.</p> <p>Exactly a week before the Sitholes fled their home, trouble had begun 30 or so miles away in Alexandra, a densely populated township in northern Johannesburg. At the time, it seemed to have come from nowhere. On the afternoon of May 11, a crowd of South Africans gathered on the outskirts of the township and attacked the occupants of an abandoned factory said to be inhabited primarily by Zimbabweans. By the following morning, the crowd had grown and was moving through Alexandra's shack settlements, driving foreigners from their homes, looting some and burning others.</p> <p>During the next few days, the violence spread from Alexandra as if by contagion. The following week there was looting and killing in shantytowns as far away as Durban and Cape Town. Three weeks after it began, it was all but over, having been doused by the army and police, who made more than 1,000 arrests. More than 60 people were dead, and tens of thousands had had to flee their homes.</p> <p>Few South Africans would deny that what happened is both a catastrophe and turning point in their country's history. Mandela's South Africa was not long ago the world's most celebrated young democracy. Johannesburg's inner-city neighbourhoods were among the most cosmopolitan places on the continent. Many dreamed that it was on these streets that a new African identity might emerge. At the very least, the May riots herald the end of a young nation's innocence.</p> <p>For the violence takes its place in a long sequence of bad news. The ruling ANC, long considered the most sober and unflappable of Africa's liberation movements, seems in recent times to have drifted from its moorings. Over the past two years, it has been roiled by the bitterest and most unseemly of conflicts between rival factions. Now, little more than four months after the riots, the battle for power has reached a dramatic climax; South African President Thabo Mbeki has resigned after a palace coup in his own party. His probable successor, Jacob Zuma, is a wild card, a populist figure whose supporters have launched ominous and cynical attacks on the judiciary in an attempt to scupper an impending corruption trial against him. The party is turning into a new creature, one that is as yet unknowable.</p> <p>And so there is trouble among South Africa's elite and in its shantytowns. It is tempting to draw a comparison between the two. The chilling acquisitiveness with which mobs have looted and burned the homes of foreigners bears comparison with the thuggery and naked hunger for power recently displayed in the ranks of the ruling party. Some of Zuma's supporters have threatened to kill those who would obstruct their man's ascendancy. And the battle within the ANC has had other destructive results. South Africa has faced one crisis after another. Serial electricity blackouts hit much of the country this January. It emerged that poor government planning had left the country short of power for years to come, handicapping future investment in mining and manufacturing, a dire prospect for a country desperate to get the unemployed into work.</p> <p>This was the backdrop to the attacks that began in Alexandra on May 11. There hasn't been a nationwide outbreak of social unrest like it since the dying days of apartheid. South Africa's defeated former president has himself been prone to talk in apocalyptic terms of the cost of failing to deliver on the South African dream. Mbeki is fond of misquoting a poem by Langston Hughes: \"What happens to a dream deferred?\" he has asked. \"It explodes.\"</p> <p>In South Africa it is the season to denounce Mbeki, and many have blamed him for the xenophobic riots. He is gone now, but the makings of a conflict, more far-reaching than the one we saw in May, remain.</p> <p>The decisions Benny Sithole made during the first days of trouble could have cost him his life. He listens avidly to radio news, so he knew by the morning of May 13 that thousands of foreigners were fleeing Alexandra. Yet as the violence spread to within striking distance of his own home, he had no thoughts of moving. \"I just didn't believe it was possible,\" he said. \"Four years is a long time to live in one place. You are settled. You know many people by name. Maybe in other places, I thought. But not here.\"</p> <p>The Sitholes lived in Ramaphosa, a shantytown of some 30,000 people about 20 miles from Johannesburg - in an area called Dark City, the last part of the settlement to remain unelectrified. Like dozens of other settlements around Johannesburg, it emerged overnight, when recent immigrants erected shacks on municipal land. Over the years, the government has steadily provided it with one service after another, first water, then electricity, then several hundred brick-and-mortar houses. A cross-section of southern Africa lived there: South Africans from all over the country with their many languages, Zimbabweans, Mozambicans, Malawians, small minorities of Angolans and Congolese. All are first-generation Johannesburgers, and almost none regards the city as home.</p> <p>\"The trouble started far from Dark City,\" Sithole said, \"in the centre of Ramaphosa, where the non-South Africans have set up rows and rows of stalls. They sell everything from vegetables to live chickens. A group of young men came to steal the chickens, knock over the vegetables and kick the stalls down.\" The next day, the crowd worked its way through Ramaphosa, gathering numbers as it moved. By the Sunday morning, the crowd was close enough for Sithole to hear them. Those who had gathered to loot and kill were singing freedom songs composed during the struggle against apartheid. Only now, they no longer sang of white minority rule, but of foreigners, and of the jobs, houses and women the foreigners had stolen.</p> <p>\"With the singing in our ears,\" Sithole said, \"something happened. The young unemployed South African men of Dark City - people I know very well, people who sit and play dice all day long - started to take things from our stalls. They took handfuls of tomatoes and cabbages. Some of the older people came and called the younger ones to task, then went back to playing dice.</p> <p>\"There is this committee in Dark City. It is composed of the South Africans who live among us. It called an emergency meeting; the idea was to form a defence unit to keep the crowd away from our homes. But halfway through the meeting, the committee changed its mind. It decided, no, we are not going to stop them. Some South African neighbours came to me and said, 'You must go. If you stay, you will die.'</p> <p>\"I ran to the shack of a South African friend at the other side of Dark City,\" Sithole continued. \"He has been a customer of mine every day for four years. He let me in. I phoned my wife. She was out working. I told her not to come home. My friend sheltered me for four days and nights. I did not dare to come out in case I was recognised. I must have been the last Mozambican left in the whole of Ramaphosa.</p> <p>\"On the fifth night, my host came to me looking upset. He said, 'Listen, this place is not the same, it is run by thugs now, and there is talk that I am hiding foreigners. You must go.' \"</p> <p>Sithole stole out of Ramaphosa at 2am the following morning the same way he had arrived - with the clothes on his back. When we met, he was living in the back of a truck with several other refugees outside Reiger Park police station, less than a mile from Dark City. \"My South African customers have come out of Ramaphosa one by one to pay their respects to me,\" he said. \"They tell me they are so embarrassed by what has happened.\"</p> <p>Sithole is adamant he will stay in South Africa. \"My wife is here. I will not find work in Mozambique. There are plenty of places here in Johannesburg where the foreigners are still accepted. I have friends from home in Soweto. Things are peaceful there. It is not yet time for us to run.\"</p> <p>Sithole is right. South Africa's several million foreign nationals have not been expelled, and most of urban South Africa remained quiet during the two weeks of trouble. There were rumblings for a night or two in parts of Soweto, but the violence did not explode there. In the massive shack settlement of Diepsloot, west of Johannesburg, the trouble lasted one night. The next day, the local branch of the ANC began a campaign charmingly dubbed Shit On The Criminals. Looted property was confiscated and several dozen young men arrested. Ramaphosa is among the few places to which foreign nationals have been unable return to rebuild their lives.</p> <p>And yet, looking at the origins of the violence and how it spread, the question remains - when and in what form will it come back, and who will be the target next time?</p> <p>Alexandra township, where the violence began, occupies little more than a square mile of northern Johannesburg. Built to accommodate 60,000 people, it is now home to about 400,000. Those who flock there have laid claim to every conceivable space. What were once the playing fields of a local high school are now occupied by 1,200 shacks. The backyards of houses in the heart of the original township are lined with tin shacks: some tenants pay rent to the family in the main house; some don't.</p> <p>Were the troubles simply a case of a vastly overpopulated place finally snapping? It is not as simple as that. There was forewarning of the violence. It was advocated in public forums in the days before it began. \"It happened in the middle of our regular weekly forum at the police station on May 6,\" said Thomas Sithole (no relation to Benny), chairman of the Alexandra Community Policing Forum. South Africa's constitution mandates every police station commander to establish such a forum to consult with the civilians in his jurisdiction. \"Out of nowhere, the representative from the Beirut section of the township stood up and said that the people in his area were sick and tired of crime, and that the police were doing nothing about it. He said they were ready to gather arms and retaliate. Then, four days later, on the Saturday, a meeting of the residents' association in that area was held at a church on Third Avenue. It ended with a resolution to chase out the foreigners. The violence began, in that sector, the following day.\"</p> <p>The area has been dubbed \"Beirut\" because it is no stranger to urban warfare. In 1996, conflict in Alexandra erupted between the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the ANC in the run-up to municipal government elections. Zulu-speaking IFP supporters were chased from their homes and resettled in Beirut. Non-Zulu speakers fled Beirut. That the area is Zulu is largely a result of violence.</p> <p>The troubles of this May were concentrated in Beirut. When foreign nationals began returning to Alexandra after the violence subsided, those whose homes were outside Beirut went back to their original shacks. Those from Beirut did not. Non-Zulu-speaking South Africans in Beirut reportedly lost their homes, too. Joe Sikwale, a veteran civic leader in Alexandra, told us, \"The Venda speakers who were chased away were told their homeland is so close to Zimbabwe that they are not South Africans. Shangaans were told that, because they share the same language as Mozambicans, they must run away with their Mozambican brothers.\"</p> <p>Local party politics may be at the root of the violence. The IFP once controlled the municipal ward that incorporates Beirut. It lost it in 2006, when ward boundaries were redrawn to include a large bloc of ANC supporters. It is conceivable that local party activists, stung by the loss of influence that comes with control of a ward, wanted to change the composition of the electorate.</p> <p>Yet if the first days of unrest strongly echoed a fight that took place 12 years earlier, there were marked differences. In 1996, the violence remained party political, and it stayed in Alexandra. This time, the troubles spread quickly, and as they did so they lost much of their ethnic character. In Ramaphosa, where Benny and Kate Sithole fled their home, the IFP has little or no presence. \"The people marching and singing through Ramaphosa were Zulu, Xhosa, Pedi, South Sotho: they were all South Africans mixed,\" Sithole said. Of the scores of refugees we interviewed who had taken refuge at police stations and town halls, most said they had run from \"thugs\", \"young ruffians\" and \"drunks\", all speaking a mixture of languages.</p> <p>Victim after victim told us that the violence took them by surprise. And yet, clearly, the news from Alexandra that mobs had turned upon foreigners stirred a powerful current, inspiring people around the city and the country to do the same. The mobs sang of foreigners stealing houses, women and work. Behind their choice of words lies much of the explanation of the violence.</p> <p>\"People say there is a struggle for resources going on between South Africans and foreigners,\" a senior Johannesburg bureaucrat, who asked not to be named, told us. \"Actually, the struggle is long over. The foreigners have won hands down.\"</p> <p>He is exaggerating, but a study recently conducted by the authoritative Centre for Development and Enterprise found that the unemployment rate among foreign nationals in Johannesburg was 20%. The roughly equivalent figure for South Africans in Johannesburg is 33%. In that large difference lies an important story. Of the 80% of foreign nationals who work, more than half are self-employed. This is all the more remarkable when one considers that most arrived here illegally, without benefit of venture capital or even a bank account. Many are what development economists call survivalists, working long and difficult hours to earn the equivalent of an unskilled labourer's wage.</p> <p>Many, though, are much more than that. The study found that foreign nationals employ 100,000 South Africans across Johannesburg. This entrepreneurship is the face of immigration in the poor neighbourhoods. From sidewalk barbers to fresh produce traders, their work is conducted on the streets and in roadside stalls. As for wage labour, anecdotal evidence suggests that employers are recruiting foreigners over South Africans in construction, security and domestic work, according to Professor Lawrence Schlemmer, who managed the Centre for Development and Enterprise study.</p> <p>In housing, there is a parallel story. Since coming to power, the ANC government has built more than two million homes, known as RDP houses, for the poor. Walk into any shantytown, and people will show you the document proving that they have been on a waiting list for a house for five or 10 years. A common complaint among those waiting is that many RDP homes are occupied by foreigners who have acquired them by corrupting government officials. There are other explanations.</p> <p>\"What an unemployed person needs above all,\" said Julian Baskin, of the Alexandra Renewal Project, \"is income. Give an unemployed person a house and she will be tempted to sell it. The banks won't underwrite the sale. It must be cash. So it's cheap. Foreigners in South Africa working or running a business will have cash. It figures that they'll be well represented among secondary buyers of RDP homes.\"</p> <p>Of the 50 or so refugees we interviewed, almost all worked, either as wage labourers or as entrepreneurs. Most said that a great many of the South Africans they encountered every day were unemployed. When we asked why they appeared to find work more easily than South Africans did, many answered by disparaging their South African neighbours. \"To be selling fresh vegetables by seven in the morning,\" Benny Sithole told us, \"I must start making my way to the fresh produce market at 3am. I can say that there is not a single South African awake at that time. The people on the street preparing for work are foreigners, every last one of them. For the South African, 3am is too cold. He must sleep until eight.\"</p> <p>A Mozambican we met, who identified himself as Alberto, had run a construction business in South Africa for the past five years. He employed eight people, all recruited from his village in Mozambique. \"We arrived in this country without tools,\" he said. \"At first we accepted any job, even if it paid R40 ($5) a day. A South African will not work for that amount, especially not for a white man. As we worked, so we saved. We bought tools. When we started the business, we offered to build for very little money. Business picked up. We charged more. As we gained success, so we bought televisions and stereos and other nice things. The South Africans got angry and wanted to steal our nice things. From their point of view, what they saw was foreigners coming to do work they refused to do and then buying things they could not afford.\"</p> <p>Refugees we spoke to believed that South Africans were workshy because they looked to the state for their salvation. A Malawian named Napier Banda, who, until the troubles, lived in a small shack settlement on the outskirts of Boksburg, said, \"Many of my South African neighbours were unemployed. Most of them were Zulu. They complained that the reason they had no work was that Thabo Mbeki was a Xhosa. They said that when Jacob Zuma [who is Zulu] comes to power, he will deliver for them.\"</p> <p>As we toured one site of violence after another, it became apparent how overwhelmingly local politics are consumed by struggles over state patronage. In Alexandra, a building contractor constructing RDP homes on the eastern rim of the township complained he was forced to source his labour through a local ANC man, who skimmed off the top of everyone's wage. Those squatting in abandoned factories to the north of Alexandra were required to pay rent to an executive member of the South African National Civics Organisation, a body aligned to the ANC.</p> <p>In a shantytown called Jerusalem, a few minutes' drive from Ramaphosa, we met a South African woman named Grace Obose, who ran a police-sanctioned citizen's patrol group. We asked if anyone had ever threatened her. \"The only time they tried to kill me,\" she said, \"was before the 2006 municipal election. There was a fellow in the ANC who very much wanted to stand as a councillor in this ward. But someone else was already standing. So he and his backers joined the Pan African Congress. I have a big following in this community. They told me I must come with them to the PAC so they could win. I kept saying no. One night they threw petrol on my shack and lit a match. Thank God I was awake and escaped.\" In Jerusalem, who had access to the local government budget was clearly a matter of life and death.</p> <p>At a workers' hostel in south Johannesburg, inhabited primarily by networks of Zulu migrants from KwaZulu-Natal, we interviewed the local IFP leader, Boy Simelani. \"The ANC has sewn up the 2009 elections,\" he complained, \"because of the World Cup in 2010. All the construction for the World Cup is controlled by the ANC. They will be handing out the jobs. Our chance to win votes will come only after the World Cup is finished.\"</p> <p>Those who believe that income derives primarily from state patronage essentially view the national economy as one great barrel around which everyone gathers to feed. You jostle with your neighbours for access to it. You fight for your share. And if this is how you see things, the presence of several million foreigners becomes both a special provocation and a source of confusion. For with their stalls and businesses and incessant work, they seem to be taking something that ought to have been given to you, the patrimony owed to you as a person who survived apartheid and voted into power a democratic government.</p> <p>This is how those who admitted to us that they had taken part in the violence justified what they had done. Two weeks after an immigrant was burned to death in Ramaphosa, the ANC Women's League held a prayer meeting on the spot where the mob had set him alight. Outside the meeting a group of sullen young men gathered to express their discontent. One of them, who identified himself as David, told us he had joined the crowd and driven out foreign nationals because they were stealing chunks of South Africa's economy. \"This entire country is leaking into the pockets of Mozambicans,\" he said. One of his companions joined in: \"They have flooded this country like water, but they are leaving our land dry.\"</p> <p>And the hostility is not simply directed at foreigners. Grace Obose told us that while the mob that ran riot in Jerusalem targeted foreigners, \"it also attacked the two biggest shebeens [drinking dens]. Both are owned by South Africans.\" The mob had formed to loot and it no longer cared for the distinction between being foreign and being relatively wealthy. The two had become the same.</p> <p>Why have many South Africans come to see their democracy as a battle for state patronage? Moeletsi Mbeki, an outspoken critic of his brother Thabo's former government, and the only South African commentator whose opinions make headline news, tells a withering tale. When it was clear that apartheid was dying, he says, South Africa's captains of industry asked themselves what to do to prevent the country's liberation movement from nationalising the banks and mines, as promised. Their solution was to offer to buy off the new political elite: to offer it large chunks of equity across South Africa's economy. The new elite said yes, and the pact was sealed.</p> <p>The government has called the programme Black Economic Empowerment (BEE). The rationale of BEE is to \"transform the white-owned economy to be representative of the demographic make-up of the country as a whole\". Yet Mbeki is fond of pointing out that the major beneficiaries of large equity transfers are all individuals connected to the ANC. For that is precisely the point: what is being traded is political influence.</p> <p>The ANC, Mbeki argues, is behaving precisely the way the first generation of post-independent African elites did in the 60s, using the state power it has captured to enrich itself. Perhaps the struggles for state patronage witnessed at the sites of the recent violence were a case of a people doing just as their leaders have done.</p> <p>Worryingly, South Africans appear unable to talk much about any of the major ingredients of May's violence. Ethnic differences, clearly an important subtext during the troubles, are a taboo subject. Nor can South Africans talk with much freedom about the resentment they feel for having to share their country with several million foreign nationals. \"Our country belongs to all Africans,\" is a phrase government officials and ANC functionaries have repeated over and again since the troubles. Nor are political corruption and kickbacks subjects for polite conversation. South Africans find themselves in the midst of a very serious impasse about which they cannot speak.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonny Steinberg's new book, Three-Letter Plague, is published by Vintage in January</p>",
  "<p>John, son of Zebedee, was one of the first apostles to be called. Now centenarian, blinded by the searing light of his vision of the last days, he is in exile on the island of Patmos, waiting for the second coming, which he believes to be imminent. His small and devoted band of disciples wait with him, first on Patmos and then, when the exile is lifted, at Ephesus, where he goes to preach and to die. Through the long years of hardship not the slightest sign has come to him. As he waits, he goes over events distant in time but vividly present to his mind. He remembers the summons, the person of Jesus, the ministry, the passion. As time passes, some of the younger disciples grow restless and rebellious; one of them, Matthias, foments this feeling and heads a breakaway heretical faction. </p> <p>Niall Williams, whose previous novels include the acclaimed Four Letters of Love and Boy in the World, says that he began by wondering about the saint's life and then tried to imagine it. This is the usual route that fiction takes, but John cannot be imagined beyond a certain point because his life is authenticated in the biblical account of it, which is not in any way questioned in the novel. What is imagined - and rendered with great force and conviction - is the inner life of the apostle, his travails of soul as he waits for Jesus to return. He remembers how he dropped the nets and followed; he remembers the amazing impact of the messianic personality; the grief as he stood with the others below the crucified form. He also remembers, with the same clarity and authorial validation, the changing of the water into wine, the feeding of the 5,000, the raising of Lazarus. And with this we have changed terrain - we have crossed over from the dramatic to the miraculous. </p> <p>Among those who might read this book there will be a good number in the same situation as myself, heirs to Christian sensibility but without belief in the doctrine, impressed by the dramatic but more than sceptical of the miraculous. For the purposes of the novel, John is not required to recall the miracles; the story is wonderful enough without them. Obviously the author chose to make him do so. But in matters such as this, the reader too should have some choice, and here he is given none. There is an exact coincidence of viewpoint between the character who remembers and the person who provides him with the words. There is no element of sorely needed questioning, no space for the doubt that forms so large a part of human rationality. Might not the saint's memories be confused? After all, he is 100 years old. The rebel disciple, Matthias, might have provided a counter-voice. He does suggest at one point that this might not be the same John who was once in the presence of Jesus, but he is discounted from the start, portrayed as manipulative, cold-hearted, hungry for power; deeply wicked, in fact. It is difficult to believe that he could ever have had the fervour and devotion to follow John in the first place. He undergoes no course of disaffection or disappointment, there is no process of scrutiny.</p> <p>It is a pity about these stumbling blocks, because there is much to admire in the novel. Narrative tension is kept up, not so much by John, who is motionless and silent most of the time, but by the intrigues and misadventures of the disciples. Particularly prone to accident is Papias, the youngest, on whose strong arm John leans when he goes forth from his cave. There is a wonderfully well realised scene, grotesque and tragic, when the young man, fired by Christian zeal, goes to offer consolation to a woman who has recently lost her husband and children and is possessed by a wish for death; he finds himself, with appalling consequences, confused between his concern for her soul and the unacknowledged lure of her body. The depiction of Ephesus at the end of the first century AD is brilliantly done, with half-baked cults of every kind proliferating, and false prophets mingling with unscrupulous traders. Matthias reappears, now with his own message and his own following, and we are given a shrewd and subtle examination of the role of spectacle in the quest for power. </p> <p>The writing is unfailingly resourceful and strong, able to range from the physical realities of poverty and deprivation to the exaltation of religious faith and the poignancies of memory. And the novel as a whole constitutes an eloquent and moving statement of the power of love and the belief that it will triumph in the end. </p> <p>\u2022 Barry Unsworth's latest novel is The Ruby in Her Navel (Penguin).</p>",
  "<p>We are winning in Iraq, John McCain declared in the presidential debate last week, \"and we will come home with victory and with honour.\" This may sound like some perfunctory keep-the-pecker-up stuff from a former military man. But the Republican candidate, who believes that the \"surge\" has succeeded in Iraq, also possesses the fanatical conviction that heavier bombing and more ground troops could have saved the United States from disgrace in Vietnam. </p> <p>On the same occasion, Barack Obama, who seems more aware of the costs of American honour to the American economy, claimed he would divert troops from Iraq to Afghanistan and, if necessary, order them to assault \"safe havens\" for terrorists in Pakistan's wild west. Both candidates sought the imprimatur of Henry Kissinger, the co-alchemist, with Richard Nixon, of the \"peace with honour\" formula in Vietnam, which turned out to include the destruction of neighbouring Cambodia. </p> <p>An ominously similar escalation of the \"war on terror\" has ensured that the next American president will receive a septic chalice from George Bush in January 2009. In July, Bush sanctioned raids into Pakistan, pre-empting Obama's tough-sounding strategy of widening the war in Afghanistan, where resurgent Taliban this year account for Nato's highest death toll since 2001. Pakistan's army chief vowed to defend his country \"at all costs\", and his soldiers now clash with US troops almost daily. Obscured by the American economy's slow-motion train wreck, the war on terror has already stumbled into its most treacherous phase with the invasion of fiercely nationalistic and nuclear-armed Pakistan. </p> <p>Most of the recent disasters of geopolitical machismo could have been foretold. In late 2003, when the occupation of Iraq was beginning to go badly wrong, the American journalist Dexter Filkins came across a village called Abu Hishma in the Sunni triangle. Rubble-strewn and \"encased in razor wire\", Abu Hishma resembled, Filkins writes in The Forever War: Dispatches from the War on Terror (Bodley Head), \"a town in the West Bank\". Its terrified residents told him about the local American commander Nathan Sassaman, who bulldozed homes and called in air strikes, and who was fond of proclaiming that \"there is no God - I am god here\". </p> <p>Sassaman sounds like something out of Conrad, the white man in the tropics driven to lunacy by absolute power and extreme isolation. But, according to Filkins, he is a bright man, even the \"embodiment of the best that America could offer\" in his desire to bring democracy to Iraqis. A serious reader of history and anthropology, Sassaman, along with fellow officers, is very impressed by a book entitled The Arab Mind, by Raphael Patai, a Hungarian-Israeli-American academic. Apparently, it makes clear that the \"only thing\" the denizens of the Middle East \"understand is force - force, pride and saving face\", and Sassaman believes that, \"with a heavy dose of fear and violence, and a lot of money for projects ... we can convince these people that we are here to help them\".</p> <p>Filkins doesn't mention that The Arab Mind, originally published in 1973, was the bible of neocon commentators in Washington and New York cheerleading the Bush administration's audacious venture: what Condoleezza Rice in the new book by Bob Woodward, The War Within: A Secret White House History 2006-2008 (Simon &amp; Schuster), describes as shifting the \"epicentre of American power\" from Europe, where it had rested since the second world war, to the Middle East. Widely read in the US military, The Arab Mind later inspired the modus operandi of the jailers of Abu Ghraib. </p> <p>More surprisingly, respectable intellectuals, journalists and academics echoed its generalisations. Among these people was the historian Bernard Lewis, who assured Dick Cheney, one of his most devoted readers, that \"in that part of the world, nothing matters more than resolute will and force\". The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman (who is on Sassaman's reading list) exhorted the US to act \"just a little bit crazy\", since \"the more frightened our enemies are today, the fewer we will have to fight tomorrow\". Accordingly, Richard Armitage, assistant secretary of state and a relative moderate among the Bush administration's hawks, told Pakistani diplomats that the US would bomb their country \"back to the stone age\" if it did not withdraw its support for the Taliban. </p> <p>The idea that the natives would recognise superior firepower when they saw it seemed to be validated by Pakistani acquiescence, followed by the Taliban's swift capitulation. Iraq was logically the next setting for shock-and-awe tactics - Donald Rumsfeld was complaining even before the aerial bombing of the Taliban had finished that Afghanistan had run out of targets. The Bush administration claimed that Saddam Hussein had to be disarmed to make the Middle East safe for democracy. But invading Iraq was also an image-making exercise - what Hannah Arendt, commenting on the absence of clear military goals in America's previous war of choice in Vietnam, described as the attempt by \"a superpower to create for itself an image which would convince the world that it was indeed 'the mightiest power on earth'\".</p> <p>Busy unleashing his awesome firepower on Iraq, Rumsfeld had no idea what to do after his streamlined army reached Baghdad, apart from letting stuff happen. Wiser in Battle, the memoir of the US lieutenant general Ricardo Sanchez (HarperCollins), reveals that, as the Iraqi resistance unexpectedly intensified, the defeat in Vietnam began to prey on Bush's mind, unravelling his syntax as he harangued his commanders in Iraq:</p> <p>Kick ass! ... We must be tougher than hell! This Vietnam stuff, this is not even close. It is a mind-set. We can't send that message. It's an excuse to prepare us for withdrawal ... There is a series of moments and this is one of them. Our will is being tested, but we are resolute. We have a better way. Stay strong! Stay the course! Kill them! Be confident! Prevail! We are going to wipe them out! We are not blinking!</p> <p>Thomas Ricks, the Washington Post's Pentagon correspondent, describes in his book Fiasco (Penguin) how, after a mob ambushed and killed four American military contractors in Falluja, the commanders were ordered to \"go in and clobber\". Citing strategic and logistical reasons, the military chiefs pleaded for restraint, but they were overruled by the White House: the destruction of Falluja was as essential to the image-making exercise as the carpet-bombing of Vietnam and Cambodia. </p> <p>The geopolitical consequences as well as the \"collateral\" damage of the exhibition of US might are succinctly outlined by the titles of recent books - The Forever War, Fiasco and Ahmed Rashid's Descent into Chaos (Allen Lane). Rashid is clearly the most despairing among the journalists accompanying the march of folly, even though, as a Pakistani long accustomed to the pretensions and limits of US power in south Asia, he didn't start off with many illusions. His previous book described how a combination of selfish motives and reckless actions by the US facilitated the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Pakistan and Afghanistan. \"Outsiders like me,\" he writes in Descent into Chaos, \"found it remarkable that a US president could live in such an unreal world, where the entire military and intelligence establishments were so gullible, the media so complacent, Congress so unquestioning - all of them involved in feeding half-truths to the American public.\"</p> <p>The habitual deceivers are often, in the end, the most deceived. According to Rashid, Pervez Musharraf's regime in Pakistan may have pulled off one of the biggest swindles in recent history by persuading the Bush administration to part with $10bn in exchange for mostly empty promises of support for its \"war on terror\". Most Pakistanis feel a mix of contempt and distrust for the US, which abandoned their country after enlisting it in a proxy war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Confronted with a choice between regressing to the stone age and meeting crazy Uncle Sam's demands, Musharraf's regime adopted a policy of dissembling that the then foreign minister outlined as \"First say yes, and later say but\". Since 9/11, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Pakistan's rogue spy agency, which has long considered Afghanistan as its backyard, has continued to provide sanctuary and military support for the Taliban while occasionally arresting some al-Qaida militants to appease Washington. Mullah Omar and the original Afghan Taliban Shura, Rashid claims, are serenely resident in Pakistan's borderlands, along with \"a plethora of Asian and Arab terrorist groups who are now expanding their reach into Europe and the United States\". </p> <p>\"I'm not,\" Bush said soon after 9/11, \"going to fire a $2m missile at a $10 empty tent and hit a camel in the butt.\" Hitting camels in the butt may have been more useful than disbursing $70m in bribes to warlords such as Abdul Rashid Dostum, whom Rashid revealed in his previous book to be fond of driving tanks over his opponents. The US coaxed many of Afghanistan's old villains out of retirement to defeat the Taliban with minimum use of US troops, and then lost interest in the country.</p> <p>Rashid believes that the US could have done more to help \"nation-building\" in Afghanistan or at least prop up Hamid Karzai, who last week was reduced to plaintively asking Mullah Omar to return to Afghanistan for the sake of \"peace\". But as Tariq Ali bluntly clarifies in his new book The Duel: Pakistan on the Flight Path of American Power (Simon &amp; Schuster), the post-9/11 project of \"nation-building\" in Afghanistan, which prioritised western interests over all others, was always doomed. It was \"a top-down process\", trying to create \"an army constituted not to defend the nation but to impose order on its own people, on behalf of outside powers; a civil administration that will have no control over planning, health, education etc, all of which will be run by NGOs, whose employees will be far better paid than the locals, and answerable not to the population but to their overseas sponsors; and a government whose foreign policy is identical to Washington's.\"</p> <p>American bombing raids, which have killed hundreds of civilians in Afghanistan, further unite fractious Afghans against foreign usurpers. Tariq Ali correctly prescribes scepticism against strategists and journalists who blame Pakistan for increasing attacks on western forces in Afghanistan while disregarding the fact that \"many Afghans who detest the Taliban are so angered by the failures of Nato and the behaviour of its troops that they will support any opposition.\"</p> <p>In Pakistan, too, public anger against the US is fuelled largely by the \"knowledge that Washington has backed every military dictator who has squatted on top of the country\". Contemptuously dismissing the alarmist clich\u00e9 that jihadis are very close to getting their grubby fingers on the country's nuclear button, Ali points to the deep and persistent unpopularity of religious parties in Pakistan. The jihadis would only get that far, he asserts, if \"the army wanted them to\", which is virtually impossible unless, as may be beginning to happen now, American assaults on the country's hard-won sovereignty causes deep ideological ruptures within the country's strongest institution.</p> <p>Filkins doesn't set out any future trajectory for the venture in Iraq. He reported from the country for the New York Times, but the first-person narrator of The Forever War is less a journalist than an existential hero, eloquent with the pathos of Sisyphean striving, impotence and failure. Composed in short, often lyrical, sections, Filkins's book often seems aimed at literary posterity, where it would join such modern classics of war literature as Ernst Junger's Storm of Steel, Andr\u00e9 Malraux's La Condition Humaine and Michael Herr's Dispatches</p> <p>Unlike the war in Vietnam, which exercised some of the keenest literary sensibilities in America (Norman Mailer, Mary McCarthy, Susan Sontag), the entanglement in Iraq and Afghanistan has produced, so far at least, a meagre crop of quality journalism. The Forever War, which generally eschews historical overviews and extended analysis, succeeds more than most recent books in making cinematically vivid and imaginatively coherent the many places of horror and bewilderment that Americans have stumbled into during the \"war on terror\". This is what it is like - its brief confessions of doubt, confusion, panic and weariness seem to say - for an American young man witnessing the terrible violence of places such as Iraq and Afghanistan. </p> <p>Filkins has the exasperation of the well-travelled and atrocity-hardened journalist with his sheltered compatriots back home. The attack on the twin towers in New York makes him think that \"I was back in the third world ... My countrymen are going to think this is the end of the world, the worst thing that ever happened. In the third world this sort of thing happens every day.\" After the cyclone in Orissa, Filkins writes, \"the dead were piled so high and for so long that the dogs couldn't eat any more\". But as he strives to share with us the cruelty and tragedy of the world outside the west, he inadvertently reveals his historical innocence as well as hinting at a wider incomprehension of the postcolonial world and the decolonised mind. </p> <p>\"Do Americans imagine,\" Jonathan Schell once wrote, \"that the people of the world, having overthrown the territorial empires, are ready to bend the knee to an American overlord in the 21st?\" Even at his most tormented, Filkins doesn't really ask this crucial question, though he cannot help but be aware of the Iraqi people's eagerness to see the back of their \"liberators\" - to \"tell the Americans what they want to hear and they will go away, and we can carry on the way we want\". In a brilliantly paced account of Falluja, Filkins describes Iraqi children recoiling from American candy as if it were \"radioactive\" and remarks that the city \"was like that from the start, even before the big battle in November 2004. Anything the Americans tried there turned to dust.\" This may convey well to an American audience the frustration of their do-gooding representatives in Iraq who alternate bombs with candy. But Filkins would have advanced a greater appreciation of national or tribal feeling in Iraq if he had explained that residents of Falluja were equally intransigent in 1920, when the British imperial army had to destroy the city in order to save it. </p> <p>As perplexed as the British once were about Iraq (\"so complex, its ways so labyrinthine\"), Filkins writes with obvious fascination about Ahmed Chalabi, the Iraqi expatriate who managed to deceive some of the shrewdest politicians and journalists in America. In many ways, Chalabi, a chronic conspirator with mysterious allies in Iran, vindicates John Quincy Adams's warning to his young nation in 1821 against European-style imperialist adventures: by going \"abroad\", Adams wrote, \"in search of monsters to destroy\", America would \"involve herself beyond the power of extraction in all the wars of interest and intrigue, of individual avarice, envy and ambition\". But Chalabi, for Filkins, embodies Iraq's vexations rather than American blundering. \"When I looked,\" he writes, \"into Chalabi's eyes and saw the mirrors and doors closing, I knew that I was seeing not just the essence of the man but of the country to which he'd returned. L'etat c'est lui. Chalabi was Iraq.\" </p> <p>Whatever may be said about this amiable fraud, he was certainly not Iraq - the country he had barely set foot in for more than 40 years before the US invasion. Though easily the most original and intense American book yet on the war in Iraq, The Forever War is far from matching the stupendous achievement of Neil Sheehan's A Bright Shining Lie, which expresses more resonantly the American reporter's angst while ruthlessly investigating specific national flaws - racism, cold war paranoia, belief in technology - that entrapped the US in Vietnam. By abandoning the tasks of analysis and introspection, Filkins's book makes us suspect that the \"forever war\" might make a new generation of can-do Americans weary, but not wiser. </p> <p>\"I'd gotten caught up,\" he writes at one point, \"in the trappings and the pronouncements of officialdom, Iraqi and American.\" It is an admirably honest confession, but not one that the best US journalists covering their country's last big war would have made. Arriving in Vietnam in the early 1960s to report what was then a covert US operation, Homer Bigart, David Halberstam, Charley Mohr and Sheehan spent only a few weeks in the fog of official bluster. Their boldness was especially remarkable because the US media in the 1950s had largely shared a consensus about the dangers of communism with the White House and State Department, which regarded even newspapers such as the New York Times as extensions of foreign policy. </p> <p>Ignoring the adversarial standard set by Halberstam and Sheehan, many US journalists and commentators in the post-cold-war era have been too eager to uphold their government's claims. It is not clear if Filkins was one of the liberal interventionists with a naive faith in the Bush administration's promise to promote democracy through war. Certainly his frequent laments about the inept handling of the invasion and occupation of Iraq do not lead him to conclude that an intrinsically bad idea could have been handled much differently. He can also permit himself the belief that \"perhaps in the hideous present some larger good was being born\".</p> <p>This has the unfortunate echo of Condoleezza Rice's assertion, as Israel devastated Lebanon in 2006, that we were witnessing the \"birth pangs of a new Middle East\": that is, the Lebanese, bombed into a revolt against Hizbullah, would make their country safe for pro-Israeli and pro-American democracy. Totalitarian regimes and terrorist groups commonly use violence as a means to large-scale political engineering; it is more remarkable when democratic countries such as Israel and America do so, usually in flagrant disregard of the lessons of contemporary history. In A Choice of Enemies: America Confronts the Middle East (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson), Lawrence Freedman describes in detail the awful results - the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees, the rise of Hizbullah - of Israel's previous attempt in 1982 to redraw the map of the Middle East by assaulting Lebanon. </p> <p>It is one thing for a small country with a perennial existential crisis to believe that, as the Israeli general Moshe Dayan once put it, \"it was in our power to set a high price on our blood, a price too high for the Arab community, the Arab army or the Arab governments to think it worth paying\". But how did the US let its foreign policy become hostage to a strategy of pre-emptive war and brutal retaliation? \"How,\" Freedman asks, \"had the United States gotten itself in this position, entangled in the confusing and often violent geopolitics of the Middle East and beset by enemies on all sides.\"</p> <p>This is a bigger story than anyone can tell in one book, and the 600 pages of A Choice of Enemies cover only US foreign policy decisions from 1979, with the Islamic revolution in Iran and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Freedman is forced to skim some important details of the relationship between the US and Israel, whose continuing expansion into the occupied West Bank is probably the greatest source of the so-called Arab rage. The State Department in 1948 argued passionately against supporting a Jewish state in Palestine. The Eisenhower administration, which saw Israel as an irritant, undermining the US alliance with anti-Soviet regimes in the Middle East, ensured that the joint Anglo-French-Israeli attack on Egypt would fail. John F Kennedy sent feelers to Egypt's fiercely anti-Zionist president Gamal Abdel Nasser. Lyndon B Johnson was the first US president to manipulate foreign policy in order to bolster Jewish-American support for the Democratic party; but even he was not able to build his \"special relationship\" with Israel without encountering strong opposition from American diplomats. </p> <p>\"I could not believe what I was hearing,\" Jimmy Carter wrote in his diary after Menachem Begin confided in him his desire to reduce Palestinians on the West Bank to a minority. Even Ronald Reagan, who believed that God fixed the Middle East as the site of Armageddon, stuck to a cold war policy of close relations with reliably anti-Soviet and oil-rich Arab regimes. Friendly to Saudi Arabia, Bush Sr was actively hostile to Israeli expansionism. His secretary of state, James Baker, had only blunt wisdom (\"Forswear annexation. Stop settlement activity. Reach out to Palestinians as neighbours who deserve political rights\") to impart to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the powerful lobbying outfit for Israel, to which even Obama must now genuflect.</p> <p>Israel played a very small role in the blunders US administrations made in the late 1970s: to support the Shah of Iran long after his rule became widely despised and unsustainable, and, more fatefully, to mobilise a global Islamic jihad against Soviet communism. Trying to turn Afghanistan, as Carter's national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, exulted, into the \"Soviet Union's own Vietnam\", the CIA chose Pakistan as a logistical base for its anti-communist jihad. It funnelled money and arms to the ISI, which in turn passed on some of them to its own Islamist prot\u00e9g\u00e9s (some of whom are now fighting US and Nato troops in Afghanistan). Radicals from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Algeria and other Arab countries flocked to Pakistan to contribute to the holy war against atheistic communism. Freedman's statistics are a grim reminder of how the blowback from this first global jihad wrecked Pakistan long before it crashed into the west on September 11 2001. Pakistan, which had 900 religious schools in 1971, had \"about 8,000 official and as many as 25,000 unregistered madrassas\" by 1988. </p> <p>But if US officials noticed their indirect sponsorship of radical Islam, they did not care. As Freedman writes, \"the Reagan administration associated terrorism with leftist, secular groups linked to nationalist movements, whether the Irish, Basques or Palestinians ... Arab militants coming to support the jihad were seen at most as the equivalent of the idealists of the 1930s who joined the International Brigades during the Spanish civil war.\" </p> <p>Freedman recalls, too, some of the other political machinations that have come to haunt present generations: US support for Iraq in the latter's long war against Iran, which emboldened Saddam Hussein all through the 1980s, and the deliberate indifference to the victims of Iraq's chemical warfare. At least in these and other cynical moves, the US could claim the sanction of realpolitik. Great powers often have to make unpleasant choices to protect their interests; they have also been known occasionally to thrash (Reagan in Grenada, Putin in Georgia) a pesky neighbour or two. What is startlingly new is the Bush administration's experiment of intimidating entire peoples as well as governments in the Middle East into accepting America's worldwide hegemony. </p> <p>Seven years on, hundreds of thousands are dead, and millions of refugees on the move, while the US seems only to have boosted its old enemies in Afghanistan, Iran and Lebanon, and created formidable new ones in Iraq and Pakistan. In The War Within, Woodward shows the US president slipping deeper into his own world. \"We're killin' 'em! We're killin' 'em all!\" But not even the Bush administration, which has proved ready to do unspeakable things to its perceived enemies, can kill them all. It can continue to stage elaborate shock-and-awe spectacles, but if, as is increasingly evident, the target audience refuses to be impressed by them, they are rendered utterly futile - even dangerously counterproductive. \"Force,\" as James Baldwin pointed out in the early 1970s during the US bombing of Indochina, \"does not work the way its advocates seem to think it does. It does not, for instance, reveal to the victim the strength of his adversary. On the contrary, it reveals the weakness, even the panic of his adversary and this revelation invests the victim with patience.\"</p> <p>Apparently routed by heavy B-52 bombing in 2001, the Taliban are resurgent, straining the military resources of the US and Nato in Afghanistan to the limit. In Iraq the strategy based on overwhelming force has proved to be a catastrophic failure, and had to be replaced by General David Petraeus's new counter-insurgency doctrine that emphasises political over military tactics. Nevertheless, McCain pledges \"victory\" in Iraq, whatever that takes, including a 100-year-long military presence in the country; threatening Russia, he also seems ready to bomb Iran. Obama, though keen to withdraw troops from Iraq, upholds the complacently bipartisan consensus about Afghanistan. But more US troops in the Pashtun heartland may merely underscore the lesson learned at a terrible cost by the British army in 1839-42 and 1878-80, and the Soviet army in 1979-89. \"A troop increase,\" Rory Stewart recently reiterated in Time magazine, \"is likely to inflame Afghan nationalism because Afghans are more anti-foreign than we acknowledge, and the support for our presence in the insurgency areas is declining.\" The violation of Pakistan's sovereignty threatens to be the most calamitous of recent US misadventures. </p> <p>A gracious acceptance of the limits of US firepower may not be forthcoming from the next administration, which will face the hard choice to get out or fight on. Indeed, failure may make it even more determined to maintain the pride of US arms and the image of the mightiest power on earth. The prospect of humiliation in Vietnam was what prompted Nixon's devastation of Cambodia, setting the stage for the genocidal Pol Pot. As Hannah Arendt wrote, \"when all signs pointed to defeat\", the goal was \"no longer one of avoiding humiliating defeat but of finding ways and means to avoid admitting it and 'save face'.\" </p> <p>Could smashing up Iran or invading Pakistan become the face-saving formula for the exponents of \"shock and awe\"? Certainly, they see US force impressing the Persian and the Pakistani mind as it apparently has the Arab mind. And such is the crazy logic of a wounded militarism that, notwithstanding its battered economy, the US may soon be embattled on many more fronts in what is already its most damaging war.</p>",

  "<p>His recent, troubled films have tarnished his reputation but Carpenter still has a body of work behind him that places him as one of the all-time directing greats. This seven-movie collection, spanning the years 1976-88, presents a run of genre classics.

His nihilistic classic The Thing was released in the summer of Spielberg's ET, for example. Still, he made slick movies that looked far more expensive than they were.

I wonder why that is.</p> <p>The election is going to take place at the beginning of November.</p> <p>Barack Obama is the first African American to be a presidential nominee [NOM-EE-KNEE] for a major party. </p> <p>The first president of the USA was George Washington. Ask your teacher if they remember George Washington.</p> <h2>The last state to join the Union</h2> <p>America is made up of 50 states. That's why it's called the United States of America. States have their own governments.</p> <p>Here is an alphabetical list of the first 10 states of America: Alabama; Alaska; Arizona; Arkansas; California; Colorado; Connecticut; Delaware; Florida; Georgia.</p> <p>Can you find out the names of the other 40 states of the USA?</p> <p>The last state to join the Union was Hawaii, in 1959. Hawaii is an archipelago (an ARK-E-PEL-AGO). An archipelago is a group of islands.</p> <p>Hawaii is not even in North America. It's in the Pacific Ocean. So, as they say in America - go figure.</p> <h2>The biggest state in America</h2> <p>The biggest state in America is absolutely huge. And freezing cold.

But not many people: only 700,000.</p> <p>Alaska exports mostly oil, gas, salmon, cod and crab. And politicians.</p> <p>John McCain - remember him up in \"the first\"? - is running for the presidential election with someone called Sarah Palin (she's his \"running mate\"). Sarah Palin is the first woman to be chosen as a presidential running mate. She's from Alaska.</p> <h2>The smallest state in America</h2> <p>The smallest state in America is Rhode Island. It's not an island, but it does contains islands. Rhode Island is tiny. It covers just 1,545 square miles.</p> <p>Even though it's small it has the longest name of all the states of the USA. Its official name is The State of Rhode Island and the Providence Plantations. It's sometimes called the Ocean State (it's by the ocean). Or Little Rhody.</p> <p>Rhode Island is famous for its gangsters and also for its special hot dogs, called \"Hot Wieners\" or \"New York System Wieners\", which are basically mini-hot dogs covered with a meat sauce and onions.

  "<p>John McCain's campaign team was hoping yesterday for a desperately needed revival in its fortunes on the back of running mate Sarah Palin's folksy and punchy performance in the vice-presidential debate.</p> <p>Palin lifted the spirits of Republicans, providing McCain with a platform to build on in his remaining two debates with Barack Obama, the first of them in Nashville, Tennessee, on Tuesday.</p> <p>McCain, who was relatively passive in the first presidential debate, is under pressure from Republicans to engage Obama more aggressively. Asked when he would take the gloves off, McCain said: \"How 'bout Tuesday night.\"</p> <p>McCain's team is looking for a strong performance to reverse what has been its worst week so far of the campaign, in which polls shifted to Obama in response to the Wall Street meltdown.</p> <p>The shift mainly explains why McCain announced on Thursday that he was effectively conceding Michigan, a swing state, by pulling out campaign staff and ending ad spending. The decision signals a radical change in strategy, effectively giving up on winning Democratic states in favour of holding the states Bush won in 2004.</p> <p>An Obama organiser said that until a fortnight ago the mood among white Democrats in Michigan had been sullen, with little enthusiasm for Obama. The financial crisis had changed that. \"If the election was held today, Obama would have a narrow win\" in Michigan, he said. </p> <p>In an otherwise bad week, Palin's performance in the vice-presidential debate, in St Louis, Missouri, on Thursday stood out as a plus. Palin, portraying herself as a feisty representative of small-town America standing up to the Washington elite, matched - and at times edged ahead of - her Democratic rival, Joe Biden. </p> <p>Although she frequently betrayed nerves early in the debate, hurrying out words and ideas, she made no gaffes, other than referring to the US commander in Afghanistan, David McKiernan, as General McClellan.</p> <p>She said she thought it had gone well and that she had been \"energised\" by it. In an interview with Fox news to be broadcast last night, she acknowledged she had been bruised by the jibes about her lack of knowledge and admitted she had made mistakes but felt she had been unfairly \"clobbered\" by the media.</p> <p>Two instant polls suggested that her folksy appeal failed to resonate. A CBS News poll found that 46% of uncommitted voters thought Biden had won, with 21% saying Palin had. A CNN poll found voters declaring Biden the winner by 51% to 39%. However, politicians - some Democrats as well as Republicans - and pundits awarded Palin at least a draw or even a narrow win.</p> <p>Palin began the debate with confidence, striding across the carpet, blowing a kiss to the audience and asking Biden, \"Hey, can I call you Joe?\" She sprinkled her comments with folksy phrases such as \"doggone\", \"betcha\" and \"darn right\".</p> <p>Foreign policy provided the biggest flashpoint. After Biden made a case for early withdrawal from Iraq, Palin hesitated, but then said: \"Your plan is a white flag of surrender in Iraq. It is not what our troops need to hear.\"</p> <p>Biden betrayed emotion only once, when his eyes became moist while describing life as a single father.</p>",

The vote overturned Monday's shock result in which lawmakers opposed it 228 to 205. </p> <p>The bill, which allows the US treasury to clean up banks' balance sheets by purchasing distressed mortgage-backed securities, was signed by George Bush within hours of congressional approval. But the vote failed to prevent the worst week on Wall Street for seven years which ended with a slide in stocks as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 157 points to 10,325 amid dire economic news.</p> <p>Bush said it had been a tough week. \"There were moments this week when some thought the federal government could not rise to the challenge,\" he said.</p> <p>Thanking leaders of both parties for rallying support, he said: \"By coming together on this legislation, we have acted boldly to prevent the crisis on Wall Street from becoming a crisis in communities across our country.\" Business leaders hope the rescue package will thaw frozen credit markets and restore confidence in struggling banks. It includes measures to limit pay for senior banking executives and to increase the insured limit of US bank balances from $100,000 to $250,000. The treasury is likely to begin buying banks' assets this week.</p> <p>Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve's chairman, welcomed the plan's approval. \"The legislation is a critical step toward stabilizing our financial markets and ensuring an uninterrupted flow of credit to households and businesses,\" he said.</p> <p>The US Chamber of Commerce, which represents business leaders, said: \"With the American economy on life support, Congress took the necessary step to stop the bleeding.\"</p> <p>About 40 members of the House of Representatives changed their vote to support the plan, alarmed by jittery markets and by deteriorating economic conditions.

What more can you say?\" he said.</p> <p>Wall Street's eye on Congress has caused difficulties in recent days. The leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reid, caused a sell-off in insurance shares by suggesting that an unnamed \"major insurance company\" was \"on the verge of going bankrupt\" because of delays to the bail-out, which is designed to aid the financial sector by mopping up toxic securities from struggling banks.</p> <p>Critics of the bail-out still have reservations. Some have pounced on an apparent admission by the treasury that the figure of $700bn to buy up securities was arbitrary. Forbes magazine quoted a treasury spokeswoman saying that it was not based on any particular data point: \"We just wanted to choose a really large number.\"</p> <p>Such is the freeze on funding that the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, said his state may need a loan of up to $7bn from the federal government to plug a gap caused by the credit crunch. \"California and other states may be unable to obtain the necessary level of financing to maintain government operations and may be forced to turn to the federal treasury ...\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown yesterday created a new 19-strong national economic council as he effectively put the government on an economic war footing. </p> <p>He has added muscle to his team with the appointment of Paul Myners, chairman of the Guardian Media Group and a former chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer, as City spokesman. </p> <p>Stephen Carter, Brown's former strategy adviser at No 10 and now communications minister, will also sit on the council.</p> <p>Myners and Carter will be made peers, alongside Peter Mandelson, the new business secretary. </p> <p>The economic sub-committee is expected to meet twice a week and act as the focus of the government's effort to stave off recession, the global crisis in the financial markets and volatile prices.</p> <p>The move may clip the wings of the Treasury, which will have to share much of the key economic analysis with the Cabinet Office. </p> <p>But Brown said he was seeking \"to reconstruct the way we govern to meet the new challenges coming from financial instability, oil price rises, food shortages and by making the right investments in science and technology. We need to have a sharper focus on all these areas.\" </p> <p>He predicted that every government would reconstruct their ways of working in a similar fashion over the next few months.</p> <p>\"The new problems have completely changed, so it is not just what the Treasury does, but also energy, food and housing,\" the prime minister said.</p> <p>The new committee has already been dubbed an economic version of the exisiting Cobra emergency committee.</p> <p>Lady Vadera, the minister for economic competitiveness and small business, and a close ally of Brown's, will also attend. </p> <p>Margaret Beckett, the former foreign secretary, who has been appointed housing minister, will also be there. </p> <p>Brown knows that the state of the mortgage market will be one of the key determinants of the next election. </p> <p>He will chair the committee that will be attended by all the main economic departments, including the Treasury, business, the Foreign Office, energy and climate change, innovation and skills, communities and local government. </p> <p>In a further sign of the committee's importance, Ed Balls, the children, schools and families secretary, and a former chief economic adviser to the Treasury, will also attend. </p> <p>Downing Street also announced that a working group of senior officials, to be chaired by the cabinet secretary, Sir Gus O'Donnell, and the permanent secretary at the Treasury, Nicholas Macpherson, will meet regularly with the permanent secretaries of all departments whose ministers serve on the national economic council.</p> <p>The council will meet for the first time on Monday ahead of a statement in the Commons by the chancellor, Alistair Darling . </p> <p>A network of business ambassadors will also be established to support the government overseas. </p> <p>Among the appointments are Sir John Bond, chairman of Vodafone, Lord Browne, president of the Royal Academy of Engineering and former BP boss, Marcus Agius, chairman of Barclays, and Sir Victor Blank, chairman of Lloyds TSB.</p> <h2>Profile: Paul Myners</h2> <p>Paul Myners has risen from inner city schoolteacher to become one of the City grandees called upon by the government when economic disaster strikes. He worked for the Inner London Education Authority in the late 1960s before becoming a financial journalist with the Daily Telegraph. He then joined the blue chip investment bank Rothschild, and then fund manager group Gartmore. Under his stewardship its funds ballooned from \u00a31.2bn in 1985 to \u00a375bn in 2001. After leaving Gartmore he took up several chairmanships including Marks &amp; Spencer. He is giving up all his directorships, including the Guardian Media Group chairmanship, but will not be paid in his new role.

  "<p>\"Richard Hannay,\" I kept telling myself. \"Here you are with plenty of money to amuse yourself and you're yawning your head off.\" That afternoon I had made up my mind that if nothing had happened by the end of the next paragraph I would return to the Cape.</p> <p>As I was turning the key to my Langham Place flat, I noticed my next-door neighbour at my elbow. \"I've been observing you a while,\" he said, \"and you seem like a cool customer who's not afraid of playing a bold hand.\" I listened while he told me about a plot engineered by the Jew to bring Russia and Germany to war.</p> <p>\"To thwart this fiendish scheme I have to stay alive until June 15th when the Greek Premier, Karolides, comes to London,\" he continued, \"but the enemy are close on my tail. So I've bought a corpse from Harrods that the Boche will think is me and left it in my flat to cover my tracks. Now I just need somewhere to hide.\"</p> <p>\"Wouldn't it have just been easier to go straight to the British government?\" I asked.</p> <p>\"That would have rather ruined the book.\"</p> <p>I liked the cut of his jib.</p> <p>\"Thank you for playing the white man,\" he said. \"Scudder at your service.\"</p> <p>Several days later I found him dead on my living room floor. I had seen bodies before in Matabeleland, but this was different. Scudder was white. I was in the soup. I would be suspected of Scudder's murder and the Boche would know I knew their plans. I had no choice but to lie low in Scotland for 20 days. I found his notebook, persuaded the cockney milkman to lend me his cap by saying, \"Gaw blimey, guv'nor\", and escaped to St Pancras.</p> <p>I jumped off the train near Galloway, easily escaping the attentions of the police with my veldkraft. Alone that evening in the heather, I opened Scudder's notebook and saw it was written in cipher. With my hallmark cool logic, I had it cracked in 10 minutes. </p> <p>What I read shocked me to the core. The Jew plot was eyewash. This was bigger than just killing a dago, it was the Boche Black Stone planning to infiltrate the British establishment, kill a Frenchie, steal our plans and sneak out at high tide by the 39 steps at 10.27pm. I stole a car and drove like the wind, escaping the police a second time by driving over a cliff and hanging on to a thorn for dear life. </p> <p>I set off on foot, encountering Sir Harry, the Liberal candidate, on the road. Something about his aristocratic demeanour made me trust him.</p> <p>\"You are in a pickle, Mr Hannay,\" he said. \"You should talk to my godfather, Sir Walter Bullivant, the PS at the FO who lives in Wiltshire.\"</p> <p>I bade him farewell and continued until I came to a remote farmhouse. \"Ich have been expecting you,\" the Black Stone sneered, locking me into a store room. I had unwittingly stumbled on the enemy's lair. I quickly found some explosives, blew a hole in the wall and hid in a dovecote, before running 20 miles to the derelict cottage of a roadman I had befriended earlier.</p> <p>\"Ach, I have no time for the polis,\" he said, \"and I can see you're a gentleman. You can hide out here.\" I could sense my exploits had already stretched the credulity of a nine-year-old and that I needed a break, so I conveniently succumbed to a recurrence of my malaria for a week.</p> <p>Eventually my strength returned and I ran through the night from Scotland until I came across a fisherman by a Wiltshire riverbank. It had to be my contact.</p> <p>\"I'm an innocent man, Sir Walter,\" I gasped.</p> <p>\"Don't worry old boy,\" he replied. \"Scudder told me all about you before he was killed.\"</p> <p>Unaware of what a bizarre coincidence it was that I had been directed to Sir Walter or what a complete waste of time my Scotch adventures now were, I fell into a dreamless sleep. I awoke to a sense of anticlimax and a strangely familiar face leaving a private meeting with Sir Walter and four British and French generals.</p> <p>\"That wasn't Lord Alloa,\" I said, bursting into their room. \"That was the Black Stone.\"</p> <p>\"Good God!\" Sir Walter cried. \"The Boche are privy to our secrets.\"</p> <p>\"Not quite yet,\" I replied. \"The Black Stone will want to tell the Boche in person. If we can find him before he gets home to Germany, Britain will be saved.\"</p> <p>I pushed Allied high command to one side and studied the maps until I found a pier in Kent with 39 steps where high tide would be at 10.27pm. \"There, unless I'm very much mistaken,\" I said, \"we shall find the Black Stone.\"</p> <p>\"Arrest him quickly,\" Sir Walter insisted.</p> <p>\"Not so fast. We Brits play by the rules and we can't arrest him until we know he really is the Boche.\"</p> <p>I settled down to a long game of bridge with the Black Stone. Damn him, he was good. Just as I was beginning to wonder if he might be British after all, he made a fatal error.</p> <p>\"Only a German would have bid no trumps.\"</p> <p>\"Gott in Himmel, Hannay. Ze game is hoch!\"</p>",

  "<p>Almost nobody has yet seen Oliver Stone's forthcoming movie about George W Bush, but already it's hugely controversial. A White House spokeswoman has predicted that it will be full of inaccuracies, and says the president plans to ignore it. Rightwing columnists and bloggers have condemned it as a vicious smear. Leaked pages from an early script have been picked apart by the media. Before interviewing Stone, I rewatched several of his darkly brilliant conspiracy films, and once you've marinated for a while in their pervasive sense that unseen forces are at work in the world, it's hard not to look at the pre-release controversy and wonder: to whose advantage, ultimately, does it accrue? Who's pulling the strings here? Follow the money. Cui bono? Who benefits?</p> <p>But maybe that's unfair: Stone insists he can't bear the label \"controversial\" and says he doesn't benefit from it at all. \"To be 'Oliver Stone', whoever that is, is to provoke feelings in people before they've met me,\" he says with some exasperation, hunched forward in an armchair in his tidy Santa Monica office. \"[People say] 'I don't want to work with him - he's controversial!' But I'm not controversial. I make people think, sometimes.\" Stone sighs. \"Maybe making people think is controversial.\"</p> <p>Far from being commercially helpful, Stone's reputation for controversy made the film almost impossible to produce: no big American studio would touch it, and funding had to be cobbled together from several European sources. The actor Josh Brolin, who plays Bush, nearly declined for fear of the potential professional repercussions; other cast members took a lot of persuading, too. \"Maybe I'm going to get nauseated and never do another movie,\" Stone says. \"Because they're so hard to do! This was so tough, in terms of getting it together, rushing, getting all these people to work for so little in the hope there'd be a profit. I won't say I'm box office poison, because I'm not, but...\" He seems tired. The movie industry, he explains, \"is fucked. Really fucked.\"</p> <p>Given all this, the surprise is that the film, entitled W, doesn't seem to be an anti-Bush tirade. (I saw brief clips and read detailed production notes.) It's strikingly light in tone, bouncing back and forth between the president's privileged, alcohol-fuelled youth and his first term in the White House, up to the invasion of Iraq, which is presented in oedipal terms. Naturally, it's not a flattering portrait: Bush emerges as an angry loafer, oppressed by his father's achievements and his family's sense of honour, at one point drunk-driving his car on to his parents' lawn and challenging his father - \"Mr Perfect, Mr War Hero, Mr Fucking God Almighty!\" - to a fist-fight. But Brolin's Bush isn't a mocking parody. He's fundamentally human, even likable, as are some of his inner circle, including Condoleezza Rice and Karl Rove, played by the British actors Thandie Newton and Toby Jones. At least in part, W - co-written with Stone's collaborator on Wall Street, Stanley Weiser - is a good-faith attempt to answer the core question about the president, which Stone frames thus: \"How did Bush go from an alcoholic bum to the most powerful figure in the world?\" (Hint: Jesus was involved.) It also delivers a frisson, reminiscent of Stephen Frears's film The Queen - which Stone cites as an influence - of being a fly on the wall during recent major affairs of state. The cast of W were chosen to be \"feelalikes\", not lookalikes, Stone says, but either way the similarities are sometimes close enough to startle.</p> <p>Stone admires Bush's sincerity and self-discipline. \"He had tremendous personal problems, and I have to give him enormous credit - he did overcome them, through willpower. Whether he solved them is another issue, but he overcame certain states of mind.\" The movie isn't angry: Stone says he has no anti-Bush anger left. \"I went through this hatred that so many of the American people are going through now, but fortunately I got over it. I had all this anger for this loss for our country, a serious eight-year loss, and now I just want to say you've got to laugh, a little bit, about this whole thing. It gets so painful that humour is the only antidote. If you didn't, you'd go bonkers. You'd become a raging lunatic on a blogosphere, writing anti-Bush screeds.\" Nor is it a conspiracy film, not least because the Bush administration's conspiracies are too well-known. Who needs to go to the cinema to be told that the march to war in Iraq involved lies, cover-up and misdirection?</p> <p>W will be released in the US on October 17, right before the election. The timing is useful from a marketing point of view, but Stone insists he had other reasons for rushing it out as its protagonist neared the end of his time in office. \"We were here for eight years,\" he says. \"And before we say goodbye in January 2009, we have to exorcise the ghost. We voted for this guy - not everyone, true, but we had him as president: he represents more than just Bush Jr. He represents a mindset of American history.\"</p> <p>The early lives of Oliver Stone and George Bush overlapped in several curious ways. They were born within three months of each other, to privileged families; both spent part of their childhood in wealthy Connecticut towns. (Stone's parents divorced as a result of the serial infidelities of his father, a stockbroker.) They both arrived at Yale University in 1964. But then their paths diverged: Bush completed his degree, then spent five years avoiding the Vietnam war with his famously lackadaisical service in the Texas and Alabama Air National Guard. Stone dropped out of Yale twice, and ended up volunteering for Vietnam, where he specifically requested combat duty and was twice wounded in action. His wartime experiences earned him a Purple Heart, and led directly to his unflinching Vietnam films - Platoon and Born On The Fourth Of July, both Oscar winners, and Heaven &amp; Earth.</p> <p>\"Bush is the [kind of] Yale boy that's completely different from me,\" says Stone. \"I had a thirst for the world. I wanted to go to Vietnam, I wanted to see the world. Africa. This guy went the other way. He stayed inside the entitlement, he operated very provincially, he stays at home. The National Guard was really about staying at home, too - not just not going to Vietnam, but staying at home.\"</p> <p>They never met at Yale, and didn't cross paths until 1999, when the two-term Texas governor was plotting his bid for the presidency. Bush was speaking at a fundraiser in Beverly Hills when Stone staggered in late. \"It was 8.30 in the morning - Republicans always have these breakfasts! - and here I am, completely dressed in black, and I think I'd been up having a couple the night before, so I looked like some version of Dylan Thomas, I think. I walked into the room and you could hear the silverware stop for a moment.\" After Bush had delivered a speech about \"tough love\" in the Texas penal system (\"It was all about the people he'd executed, and why\"), the two were introduced. \"He surprised me,\" Stone recalls. \"He said, 'We were at Yale together!' I never knew that. And then he told me a bunch of stuff about his buddies in Vietnam... He had power, man. He had charisma that day. You could tell he was going to be president.\"</p> <p>One wonders what Bush made of Stone. Back then, the director was at the height of his notoriety, midway through a five-year legal battle in which his film Natural Born Killers was blamed for a spate of copycat crimes. His personal reputation for bad behaviour was at its height, too. He and his production team reportedly scouted locations for the movie while high on psilocybin mushrooms; the year he met Bush, he pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of drugs. That kind of thing seems to belong to the past now. </p> <p>\"It's a function of age,\" Stone says. \"Once you've done certain things, you get them out of your system. Blake was right: better to kill an infant in its cradle than to repress an unacted desire. I've done a lot of things, no questions. I'm sure I've been an asshole at times. I'm sure I've been stupid, ignorant, dumb, fucked myself up, shot myself in the foot, everything. But I had a lot of learning to do in my life.\" He lives somewhat more quietly now in Los Angeles with his third wife and their teenage daughter, Stone's third child.</p> <p>He also claims, these days, to be tired of defending his movies. When Alexander received a critical drubbing in 2004, he didn't fight back; in a sequence of newspaper interviews, he gave elaborate mea culpas, saying he felt he'd failed Alexander the Great. But he remains full of contempt for the \"complete morons\" who took Natural Born Killers to be glorifying violence, and the \"literalists\" who objected to the liberties JFK took with the truth. (Its details are indeed shaky. But as a speculative exploration of the theory that Kennedy was killed by an alliance of military men, CIA agents and anti-Castro nationalists, upset at the president's growing independence of mind on Vietnam and Cuba, it remains enormously powerful; many of the attacks on Stone accused him of making allegations that aren't contained in it at all.)</p> <p>And don't get him started on the label \"conspiracy theorist\", which is an \"ugly and ominous\" term used, he says, to tarnish the reputations of anyone who thinks conspiracies ever occur, as clearly they do: his movie Nixon is all about one conspiracy that nobody now disputes. Contrastingly, Stone says, he examined the conspiracy claims surrounding 9/11 and found them unconvincing; accordingly, his 2006 film World Trade Center was a human drama about two police officers trapped under the rubble. Rightwing critics, taken aback, praised it as one of the most patriotic films they'd ever seen. Unsurprisingly, they've been less impressed by his documentaries on Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez, and a project - now apparently abandoned - involving Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, president of Iran.</p> <p>Stone showed W to \"a very senior American journalist\", he says, who warned him to expect a new deluge of hostility. \"There are lines in the movie from Bush that are out of context, but I think you used them in the correct spirit,\" the journalist told him. \"You didn't cross the line. But there are those simpletons who will go after it - they'll say, 'Well, he didn't actually say that in his pyjamas at that time.' \" Good historians, Stone says, \"understand that dramatists who deal with history have a licence they don't have. It's so ridiculous for me, in the 21st century, to be defending a position taken by Shakespeare. By Aeschylus. Sophocles. And yet here you are, years later, and you get USA Today or someone asking, 'Are you a historian or a dramatist?' What's wrong with our education system that we can't get past that?\" </p> <p>Being Oliver Stone seems like an exhausting undertaking, necessitating constant combat. But Stone appears not to feel as if he has any choice in the matter. \"I am destined to do what I do, and ultimately I'll do it at any price, if it needs doing,\" he says, with a \"what-can-you-do-about-it?\" shrug.</p> <p>And then there are the internal battles. I meet Stone the day after his 62nd birthday, and can't resist mentioning that my own is the following day. \"You're an Oliver Virgo? You're very lucky, you know that? Unfortunately, though, we're cursed with too much insecurity and doubt. Well, at least I am. My biggest harm I do to myself is I put all this pressure on myself.\" He describes himself as a Buddhist, and says daily meditation has helped calm him down: \"But even at my age, I feel the need to accomplish a certain thing every day, or things, and I go through that process of torturing myself, and then often put it off till the end of the day, or not at all, which is worse. So, of course, I suffer the consequences of procrastination: delay, doubt. General worthlessness.\" He laughs, tiredly. \"But apart from that...\" \u00b7</p> <p>\u2022 W premieres at the London Film Festival on October 23 and 24, and is released nationwide on November 7.</p>",

She is not acting like someone who could be president of the United States and John McCain is one heart attack away,\" said Priscilla Glascock, a 26-year-old nurse who is supporting Barack Obama. \"The men are going to love it,\" she sneered.</p> <p>Not just the men. \"I think it's hysterical,\" said Amanda Day, 36, a business consultant who is voting Republican. \"I think women can relate with being in a situation where it's very serious, you kind of have to step back and add that humour, whether it's a wink or it's a shrug.\"</p> <p>But for the host Kit Pepper, 52, a member of the non-partisan League of Women Voters, Palin's winking was an affront to the years she spent trying to build up her own political consultancy firm in a male-dominated world.</p> <p>\"She winked at us,\" Pepper said in disbelief. \"All the claims that the media is sexist and the Democrats are being sexist are out the window. The fact that this woman as a vice-presidential candidate stood on national TV and winked at me completely insults me.\"</p> <p>Pepper's home in Winter Park, just outside Orlando, is in the politically volatile swath of central Florida - the main battlefield in a battleground state.</p> <p>Half of her neighbours have McCain lawn signs, the rest are with Obama. When the guests started arriving with bottles of red wine labelled \"Bitch\" and \"Red Truck\" and McCain dancing dolls, they too evenly divided along party lines, choosing colour-coded name tags: red for Republicans, blue for Democrats, and gold for Undecided.</p> <p>But while the partisan loyalties were established well in advance, the Palin-Biden show soon moved into unfamiliar terrain as the first vice-presidential debate between a male and a female candidate in a generation. For the two dozen women guests, ranging in age from late teens to their 60s, it was impossible to overlook Palin's use of her femininity and Biden's efforts to avoid making gender-related gaffes.</p> <p>The guests whooped when the CNN reaction meter consistently showed Palin getting a more enthusiastic response from male viewers than women. Biden, in contrast, was a bigger hit with women.</p> <p>But their own reactions also mixed up the dividing lines of politics and gender. Some of the staunchest Democrats had a sneaking admiration for Palin's audacity - even while handing the debate to Biden on substance. \"She is owning it now. Look at her,\" said Margaret Nolan, a management consultant. \"You go girl.\"</p> <p>Some of the Republicans could not help disassociating themselves from Palin - even while praising her skill at using winks and a folksy turn of phrase to connect with middle America.</p> <p>\"I can't imagine myself doing that wink,\" said Lydia Gardner, a Republican local government official first elected in 1987. \"I lived in Boston. I lived in Washington and I went to a very cosmopolitan and very sophisticated university where that wink maybe would not have been done. But for her, and for where she is from and for her background it's perfectly appropriate.\"</p> <p>Pepper had organised her party half-expecting Palin to self-destruct. Day, on the opposite end of the political spectrum, admitted she had switched off the television set this week during Palin's now notorious interview with CBS. \"It was just too embarrassing,\" she said.</p> <p>By the end of the night, most of the party agreed Palin had made no significant stumbles. But even as Palin's little flourishes became an Alaskan blizzard of doggone its, bless their hearts, darn rights, hecks, and you betchas, she did not inspire confidence either.</p> <p>From the depths of the overstuffed sofa, Day gave Biden much higher marks on substance. \"He walked all over her on foreign policy,\" she said, but then argued that Americans don't vote on international issues anyway.</p> <p>Palin also failed to dispel the impression that she had been fed her lines by Republican handlers and was dutifully spitting them out again. \"If I hear her say the word 'maverick' one more time I am going to shoot somebody - and I am a Republican,\" said Lisa Romine.</p> <p>If Biden felt a similar frustration, he hid it fairly well from the women in the room, but Barbara Nelen, 52, a massage therapist who wore an \"undecided\" name tag, thought she picked up some condescension. \"At certain times, he just let out a big sigh,\" she said. \"It was pretty clear he looked down on her.\"</p> <p>Her daughter, Alexa, a student voting for the first time, did not feel for Palin. \"I think she is trying to be more of a motivational speaker than telling us what she would do in the government.\"</p> <p>When it was over, Day clenched both fists in the air like a prize fighter and screamed. \"She survived, she survived.\"</p> <p>Even the Democrats had to agree. Palin had survived - doggone it.</p>",
  "<p>While the talking heads were nattering on about Sarah Palin's debate, I can promise you that the real political professionals were obsessing about something else entirely on Thursday evening.</p> <p>The news that John McCain was pulling out of Michigan - closing offices and dispersing his staff to other states - was in reality the biggest US political news of the week now ending. Let's look closely at why.</p> <p>An American presidential election is won on a state-by-state basis. Each state has a certain number of electoral votes, based on the number of seats the state has in the lower federal house, the House of Representatives, plus two (because each state has two senators). Representation in the lower house is decided by population.</p> <p>For example, Ohio, with a population of 11.5 million, has 20 electoral votes - 18 congressional districts plus two seats in the Senate. Wyoming, population 520,000, has three - one congressional district plus two Senate seats. Add them all up and the total comes to 538 electoral votes. A majority of 538 - half plus one - is 270, and that's what a candidate needs to win.</p> <p>A good way to think of a presidential contest is to picture the two candidates as a political version of Karpov and Kasparov, and the United States as their giant chessboard, around which they must strategically move their pieces to win the combination of states that will get them to 270. </p> <p>Remember that competing in the various states costs money. The campaigns have to calculate everything from the cost of driving voters to the polls on election day to the price of 30 seconds of television advertising time in Orlando, Florida versus Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p> <p>So there's your background. Now, what's the current situation, and what are the ramifications of McCain running up the white flag in Michigan?</p> <p>Michigan is a \"blue\" state, having voted for Al Gore and John Kerry. But it didn't do so by wide margins, and it's one that McCain's people had very much been hoping to pick off and turn red. It has 17 electoral votes. Only seven states have more. McCain winning Michigan would have been a very big deal. But that's seemingly off the table now, barring some shocking development.</p> <p>Meanwhile, let's look at the other battleground states. The list is roughly as follows: Florida (27 electoral votes), Ohio (20), North Carolina (15), Virginia (13), Indiana (11), Colorado (nine), Iowa (seven), New Mexico (five) and New Hampshire (four). That's nine states worth a total of 111 electoral votes.</p> <p>Here's the interesting thing about those nine states: eight of them voted for George Bush in 2004. Only the smallest one - New Hampshire - went for Kerry. This means that the battle is taking place on what used to be almost entirely red territory but is now up for grabs.</p> <p>By contrast, aside from New Hampshire, there isn't a single Kerry state where McCain currently has more-or-less even footing in the polls. A few are close-ish - a margin for Barack Obama of five points or fewer - notably Pennsylvania (21) and Minnesota (10). But in none would you say today that McCain is poised to capture it.</p> <p>In other words, Obama's pawns and knights are advancing across the board. That he will no longer have to fight over Michigan means he can redeploy the troops to, say, Indiana. If he can pick off that state, which hasn't voted Democratic since 1964: checkmate.</p> <p>Here's the matter as straightforwardly as I can put it. Kerry won 251 electoral votes. Assume that Obama can hold those - by no means a given, but something he seems positioned today to do. Add Iowa, which Kerry lost but where Obama is comfortably ahead. That's 258. </p> <p>Taking Iowa off the board means that eight battleground states remain, totalling 104 electoral votes. Obama needs to win only 12 of those 104 - one or at most two states. And today, he is currently leading or tied in six of them.</p> <p>McCain will push extra-hard into Pennsylvania. Two more debates will arrive. And who knows what new national or international crisis looms that might completely change the dynamic of the race. But with a month to go, the chessboard is assuming shape. White's king is exposed.</p>",
  "<p>I still cringe at the thought of autumn, 2004. That fall, two contests took place that would decide the fate of America for the near future. One was an <a href=\"http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20041027&amp;content_id=906996&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=bos\">epic disaster</a>, a result that set the US on a terrible path. In the other, George Bush was re-elected as president.</p> <p>Yes, as a New York native, I place the <a href=\"http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=bos\">Boston Red Sox</a> winning the World Series for the first time since 1918 as a worse happenstance than the worst president of all time gaining a second term. And as the <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/index.jsp\">Major League Baseball</a> playoffs get underway again this week, let's hope we avoid a similar fate.</p> <p>That autumn four years ago was supposed to be different. John Kerry was the Massachusetts icon who was to be victorious, and <a href=\"http://americanhistory.about.com/od/elections/a/baseballpres.htm\">history suggested</a> that this did not bode well for the American League Red Sox. There was a long stretch, from 1952 to 1976, when the World Series accurately predicted the presidential election, with an AL victory in the Fall Classic presaging a Republican in the Oval Office. But that fell away until 2000, when the <a href=\"http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=nyy\">Yankees</a> swept the <a href=\"http://mrudolf.tripod.com/subway/\">crosstown</a> <a href=\"http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=nym\">Mets</a> and George Bush stole the election from Al Gore. 2004 made it two in a row. At least the team Bush used to own, the Texas Rangers, has never sniffed a championship, which likely <a href=\"http://austin.about.com/cs/bushbiographies/a/bush_background.htm\">hurts</a> Bush more than any failure as president.</p> <p>So as a Barack Obama supporter, it behoves me to root for the National League, which has been inferior, it should be said, in the last few years (the AL has won eight of the last 12 series). That could mean the <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=chc\">Chicago Cubs</a>, who had the best record in the league this season. And check it out - Barack is from the Windy City. Trouble is, he is a stated <a href=\"http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=cws\">White Sox</a> fan and celebrated in 2005 when they won their first World Series since 1917.</p> <p>If he's superstitious, he might look at the history books and ease away from the Sox, which are in the AL. And he is a politician, after all, so if the Cubs manage to climb out of the current two-games-to-none hole they are in and advance, don't be surprised if he starts making speeches wearing a blue Cubs hat. Perhaps it's best if someone else wins, just to prevent any taunting from the same media that made \"lipstick on a pig\" a breaking news event. Anyone but Boston, that is.</p> <p>As for John McCain, his home state <a href=\"http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=ari\">Arizona Diamondbacks</a>, in which his wife Cindy <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93567413\">owns a stake</a>, held a secure lead in the NL West division for much of the season, until those coastal elites from Hollywood brought in Palinesque innocent Manny Ramirez, who led the <a href=\"http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=la\">Dodgers</a> on a surge past the Snakes. It can be argued persuasively that McCain's true home team is the Washington Nationals, as he has been a creature of the capital for decades. That doesn't bode well for the aged senator, either - the Nats finished 59-102, 32.5 games behind the winners from the battleground state of Pennsylvania, the <a href=\"http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=phi\">Philadelphia Phillies</a>.</p> <p>It is, of course, asinine to tie together the World Series and the election, as I found out to my horror last cycle. Still, with the breakdown in the economy, the rhythms of the national pastime are comforting. It's why FDR kept the leagues going during the second world war and play resumed rapidly after 9/11. But if Obama loses and the Red Sox win again, I may just move to a cricket-playing country.</p>",
  "<p>Every morning I click on <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/TheNote/story?id=156238\">ABC's The Note</a> for a near-killer dose of right-leaning conventional political wisdom written with enough cutesy faux-clever asides to choke a horny corndog, or something. In any case, here's what I learned <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=3105288\">this morning</a> about last night's vice-presidential debate:</p> <blockquote> <p>Take that, Tina Fey: You betcha Gov Sarah Palin is back - darn right (wink) - and it might matter yet. She may not have been a clear winner Thursday night, but the McCain ticket has got a different story to shout out on Friday - even if all Palin did was square-dance over the bar she had lowered herself. She did more than that, actually, and that gives Sen John McCain the narrowest of openings.</p> </blockquote> <p>I don't mean to pick on The Note in particular. It's just that every so often I imagine trying to explain our country to a proverbial Martian or some genius with a time machine from another century, and I say: \"Yes, believe it or not, these are the criteria our gatekeepers employ to give people the knowledge to pick the people who will plan our wars, manage our economy, protect our ecosystem and if they deem it necessary, begin a nuclear war.\"</p> <p>I'll admit it: That Palin woman is awfully cute. I don't think I'm going too far out on a limb by arguing she's just about the cutest governor any state in America has ever had. Perky too. And while it could be annoying, the overall effect is actually quite enjoyable. She kind of reminds me of a grown-up <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Temple\">Shirley Temple</a>, who, we note, ran unsuccessfully for Congress against retired Korean war veteran Pete McCloskey in 1967. She ran on a platform supporting America's involvement in the Vietnam war and went on to hold several diplomatic posts, serving as the US delegate to many international conferences and summits and, eventually, US ambassador to Czechoslovakia.</p> <p>And if Czechoslovakia were still and existence and did not require much in the way of diplomatic expertise from its ambassador, I'd recommend Palin for that post in a minute. I was in a room of liberal fellow-travellers last night, and everybody kind of liked her. One person suggested she'd make a great press secretary for President Obama. I might be willing to go as far as UN representative, provided that she were joined by some Richard Holbrooke-type who would do the actual work.</p> <p>But vice-president to a 72-year-old man with a history of cancer who refuses to release his medical records? Are we insane? </p> <p>In a word, yes. Here's how The Note evaluates her qualifications:</p> <blockquote> <p>Maybe she doesn't want to talk more about global warming, or about what vice-presidents do, or about who's commanding US troops in Afghanistan. Perhaps she isn't entirely clear on where her running mate is on everything (it's only been, like, five weeks). Maybe (definitely) she really, really wants us to think she and McCain are \"mavericks.\" But Palin returned to the source of her popularity Thursday night at Washington University in St Louis - the folksy, aw-shucks, look-who's-running-for-vice-president appeal that reminds us that shortly before she was a drag on the ticket she was a phenom in her own right. </p> </blockquote> <p>Feel better now? Again, it's not The Note's fault. Everywhere you turn, the people paid to keep track of our political system devote themselves to exactly the same irrelevant, indeed, nonsensical criteria: </p> <p>\u2022 Palin was \"poised and confident, speaking colloquially in a way that could appeal to independents,\" <a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/politics/story/D798D030168942E5862574D700134895?OpenDocument\">Bill Lambrecht writes in the St Louis Post-Dispatch</a>. \"She was fluent, if not brilliant, on foreign policy. And even if she didn't actually answer some of moderator Gwen Ifill's questions, many voters may not have noticed and others probably won't hold it against her.\"</p> <p>\u2022 On style, <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/10/stephanopoulo-2.html\">ABC's George Stephanopoulos</a> gives Palin an A and Biden an A-. Both get Bs on accuracy. \"She beat expectations and she stopped the slide,\" Stephanopoulos said Friday on Good Morning America. \"I think the race probably solidified where it was. If you came in liking Biden, you voted for him [in post-debate polls] and if you liked McCain-Palin you probably voted for them. But that's the problem for the McCain campaign.\" </p> <p>\u2022 \"The pit bull is back, and she can still bite,\" write <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/10/02/2008-10-02_sarah_palin_didnt_lose_debate_debut_but_.html\">Michael Saul and David Saltonstall of the New York Daily News</a>. \"Palin spoke in mostly complete sentences, unlike her performance in a string of recent TV appearances.\" </p> <p>\u2022 \"The politics of spunk\", reads <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-assess3-2008oct03,0,2949181.story\">the Los Angeles Times headline</a>. Per Peter Wallsten: \"She winked. She wrinkled her nose. She gave a 'shout-out' to a third-grade class.\" </p> <p>\u2022 \"Sarah Six-Pack all but popped open a cold one. Wearing a glittery flag pin on her jacket, she blew a kiss toward the audience. She gave a wave that Tina Fey would probably describe as adorable,\" the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/02/AR2008100204250.html\">Washington Post's Dana Milbank writes</a>. \"She had talking points adequate to fill the 90 seconds on the various topics Ifill tossed her way, and often forced Biden to defend Barack Obama.\" </p> <p>Believe it or not, real people are a great deal smarter than this, thanks be to God. In polling by both CNN and CBS after the debate, all that ignorance mixed with spunkiness failed to impress. CBS had it 51-36 for Biden while CBS's undecided voters gave it to the Delware senator by a margin of 46-21. </p> <p>Having a debate - even a good one - I might add is a silly way to pick a president in the first place. You can make wise, prudent, well-informed, even bold decisions in the White House without having the qualities necessary to win one of these silly contests. But when the judges are giving you points for not spontaneously speaking in tongues - it is, again, hard to believe we are even serious about this election.</p> <p>Face it: Joe Biden is eminently qualified for the office he is seeking, and his views are deeply within the mainstream of American political discourse. Sarah Palin is not only nowhere near qualified, but she has to play all these games in order to hide her views, which, like those of George Bush, are those of the repudiated Republican right-wing. Perky or pesty, why do we need to discuss anything else?</p>",
  "<p>Brazil's minister for human rights, Paulo Vannuchi, has <a href=\"http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u451751.shtml\">rejected claims</a> by its armed forces that they do not have any information about the fate of up to 170 people who disappeared during the military dictatorship but whose bodies have never been found.</p> <p>Last week President Lula formally apologised, on behalf of the Brazilian state, to 13 victims of the dictatorship that governed the country between 1964 and 1985 in a public ceremony that was also attended by Brazil's leading Roman Catholic bishops. This was the first high-profile apology to the hundreds who were murdered and thousands who were tortured by the Brazilian military and follows growing calls within his government to bring some of those involved in perpetrating these crimes to justice.</p> <p>Unlike Argentina and Chile, Brazil has never put anyone on trial for the murder and widespread torture of political dissidents during its dictatorship, despite the fact many members of the present government suffered under it. Lula was, himself, imprisoned for leading strikes, and his chief of staff and potential successor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/12/liesandvalues1\">Dilma Rouseff</a>, was viciously tortured after being arrested as a suspected guerrilla. </p> <p>In 1979 the army pushed an amnesty law through Brazil's Congress, which they controlled, to shield themselves from future prosecutions, but Brazil's minister for justice, Tarso Genro, has argued that this does not apply to crimes of torture. The Brazilian military have responded furiously to this argument, saying that it is necessary to draw a line under the past. </p> <p>Lula last week emphasized the need for reconciliation and forgiveness. However, Vannuchi responded: \"Judges must decide whether the amnesty law can cover up torture, sexual violence, decapitation and dismemberment. The law is not all encompassing and it does not cover violent crimes, assaults or terrorism.\"</p> <p>Last May a prosecutor in S\u00e3o Paulo charged former members of the military with crimes of torture. The Organisation of American States is also due to debate the compatibility of Brazil's amnesty law with international human rights norms. Similar laws have been <a href=\"3. http://www.conectas.org/en/index.php\">struck down</a> in Argentina and Chile. </p> <p>Brazil's government has also begun opening secret files, revealing some of the human rights violations carried out during the dictatorship, and may investigate officers suspected of destroying archives to hide evidence. Last month the existence of photographs showing officers posing beside the corpses of two former Communist party members was revealed in the newspaper <a href=\"4. http://www.folha.uol.com.br/\">Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo</a>. A number of Brazil's courts have also ordered the army to provide information about the whereabouts of former guerrillas, who are believed to have been buried in secret. </p> <p>Vannuchi this week again appealed to the army to come clean about the killings. He said: \"I never tire of praising the professionalism of the army that we have today. Brazil is a solid democracy, but we must have the maturity to come to terms with our past, without stigma or prejudice. Crimes that have been committed should be investigated and the individuals responsible should be brought to justice, otherwise it shames the honour of the whole force.\"</p> <p>Glenda Mezarobba, a Brazilian human rights activist who has recently completed her doctoral research on the issue, said that the establishment of the truth about what happened in the past is not just important for the victims but for the whole of Brazilian society. \"There needs to be a decisive break between the culture of impunity that existed under the dictatorship in which violence against prisoners was permitted in the name of national security and a culture based on respect for democracy and human rights.\"</p> <p>Although Brazil's dictatorship is now becoming a distant memory, the issue remains sensitive because of the continued violence within Brazilian society. Torture is widespread and systematic in Brazil, according to the UN, and its police are regularly accused of carrying out summary and arbitrary executions. Reopening the debate about what happened under the dictatorship will be controversial, particularly if Rouseff is a candidate in Brazil's next presidential election, but it is a vital part of helping the country to come to terms with its past.</p>",
  "<p>Never before perhaps has such an infinitesimally small gesture assumed such outsize importance in a presidential election as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin's</a> wink.</p> <p>Because while as the cliche would have it the eyes are the window of the soul, Palin's use of her eyes was a window to the views of women voters in one of the most hotly contested bits of real estate in this election.<br>Palin's battery of eyelash batting got underway from the opening moments of Thursday night's contest against the Democrats' <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> -- and so did the parsing of its significance at a debate watching party in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/florida\">Florida</a>. </p> <p>\"She is trying to act like a southern belle. She is not acting like someone who could be president of the United States and John McCain is one heart attack away,\" said Priscilla Glascock, 26, and a nurse who is supporting Barack Obama. \"The men are going to love it,\" she sneered.</p> <p>Not just the men. \"I think it's hysterical,\" said Amanda Day, 36, and a business consultant who is voting Republican. \"I think women can relate with being in a situation where it's very serious you kind of have to step back and add that humour whether it's a wink, or it's a shrug.\"</p> <p>But For Kit Pepper, 52, the host and a committed Democrat, Palin's winking was an affront to the years she spent trying to build up her own political consultancy firm in a male dominated world. \"She winked at us,\" Pepper said in a state of near disbelief. \"All the claims that the media is sexist and the Democrats are being sexist are out the window. The fact that this woman as a vice-presidential candidate stood on national TV and winked at me completely insults me.\"</p> <p>Pepper's home in Winter Park, just outside Orlando, is in the politically volatile swathe of central Florida -- the main battlefield in a battleground state. Half of her neighbours have McCain lawn signs, the rest are with Obama. When the guests started arriving with bottles of red wine labelled \"Bitch\" and \"Red Truck\" and McCain dancing dolls, they too evenly divided along party lines, choosing colour-coded name tags: red for Republicans, blue for Democrats, and gold for Undecided.</p> <p>But while the partisan loyalties were established well in advance, the Palin-Biden show soon moved into unfamiliar terrain as the first vice-presidential debate between a male and a female candidate in a generation.</p> <p>For the two dozen women guests, ranging in age from late teens to their sixties, it was impossible to overlook Palin's use of her feminity, and Biden's efforts to avoid making gender-related gaffes.<br>The guests whooped when the CNN reaction meter consistently showed Palin getting a more enthusiastic response from male viewers than women. Biden, in contrast, was a bigger hit with women.</p> <p>But their own reactions also mixed up the dividing lines of politics and gender. Some of the staunchest Democrats had a sneaking admiration for Palin's audacity -- even while handing the debate to Biden on substance. \"She is owning it now. Look at her,\" said Margaret Nolan, a management consultant. \"You go girl.\"</p> <p>Some of the Republicans could not help disassociating themselves from Palin -- even while praising her skill at using winks and a folksy turn of phrase to connect with middle America. \"I can't imagine myself doing that wink,\" said Lydia Gardner, a Republican local government official who was first elected in 1987. \"I lived in Boston. I lived in Washington and I went to a very cosmopolitan and very sophisticated university where that wink maybe would not have been done. But for her, and for where she is from and for her background it's perfectly appropriate.\"</p> <p>Pepper had organised her party half-expecting Palin to self-destruct. Day, on the opposite end of the political spectrum, admitted she had switched off the television set this week during Palin's now notorious interview with CBS. \"It was just too embarrassing,\" she said.</p> <p>By the end of the night, most of the party agreed Palin had made no significant stumbles. But even as Palin's folksy little flourishes became an Alaska blizzard of doggone its, bless their hearts, darn rights, hecks, and you betchas, she did not inspire confidence either.</p> <p>From the depths of the overstuffed sofa, Day gave Biden much higher marks on substance. \"He walked all over her on foreign policy,\" she said but then argued that Americans don't vote on international issues anyway.</p> <p>Palin also failed to dispel the impression that she had been fed her lines by Republican handlers and was dutifully spitting them out again. \"If I hear her say the word 'maverick' one more time I am going to shoot somebody -- and I am a Republican,\" said Lisa Romine.</p> <p>If Biden felt a similar frustration, he hid it fairly well from the women in the room, but Barbara Nelen, 52, a massage therapist who wore a gold, or neutral, name tag thought she picked up some condescension. \"At certain times, he just let out a big sigh like a bull in the field,\" she said. \"From anyone who was really watching, it was pretty clear he looked down on her.\"</p> <p>Her daughter, Alexa, a first year university student voting for the first time, did not feel for Palin. \"Personally I think she is trying to be more of a motivational speaker than telling us what she would do in the government.\"</p> <p>When it was over, Day clenched both fists in the air like a triumphant prize-fighter and screamed. \"She survived, she survived.\" Even the Democrats in the room had to agree. Palin had survived -- doggone it.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338274269\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>The Bush administration's $700bn emergency bail-out for the banking industry finally became law today after a week of persuasion, negotiation and horse-trading prompted Congress to reverse its opposition to the plan.</p> <p>In a vote watched anxiously by traders on Wall Street, the House of Representatives backed the financial rescue plan by a comfortable margin of 263 to 171. The vote overturned Monday's shock result in which lawmakers opposed it 228 to 205. </p> <p>The bill, which allows the US treasury to clean up banks' balance sheets by purchasing distressed mortgage-backed securities, was signed by President Bush within hours of congressional approval. </p> <p>But it came too late to prevent the worst week on Wall Street for seven years which ended with a fresh slide in stocks as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 157 points to 10,325.</p> <p>President Bush acknowledged that it had been a tough week: \"There were moments this week when some thought the federal government could not rise to the challenge.\"</p> <p>Thanking leaders of both parties for rallying support, Bush said: \"By coming together on this legislation, we have acted boldly to prevent the crisis on Wall Street from becoming a crisis in communities across our country.\"</p> <p>Business leaders hope that the rescue package will thaw out the frozen credit markets and restore confidence in struggling banks. It includes measures to limit pay for senior banking executives and to increaser the insured limit of US bank balances from $100,000 to $250,000. The treasury is likely to begin buying banks' assets this week.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve's chairman, Ben Bernanke, welcomed the plan's approval: \"The legislation is a critical step toward stabilizing our financial markets and ensuring an uninterrupted flow of credit to households and businesses.\"</p> <p>The US Chamber of Commerce, which represents business leaders, said: \"With the American economy on life support, Congress took the necessary step to stop the bleeding.\"</p> <p>About 40 members of the House of Representatives changed their vote to support the plan, alarmed by jittery markets and by deteriorating economic conditions. Official figures released today showed the worst drop in US employment for five years as 159,000 people disappeared from payrolls during September.</p> <p>John Lewis, a Democrat who switched sides, said: \"I have decided that the cost of doing nothing is greater than the cost of doing something.\"</p> <p>Both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain - expressed support for the package in spite of an estimated $100bn of controversial tax credits added to win support from waverers. These included aid for special interests including Hollywood film studios and for the manufacturers of children's wooden arrows.</p> <p>The Democratic leader in the House, Steny Hoyer, said: \"The American people expected us to act, to respond to the best extent we could, to stop the downward flow in the markets and to restore the flow of credit in the economy.\"</p> <p>There has been a dismal flow of negative financial news throughout the week including a slump in factory orders and a steady decline in house prices. John Silvia, chief US economist at the banking group Wachovia, said all the indicators pointed to a likely shrinking in the US economy in the final quarter of the year: \"You put the whole package together and basically, we're in a recession. What more can you say?\"</p> <p>Wall Street's close eye on Congress has caused difficulties in recent days. The leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reid, caused a sell-off in insurance shares by suggesting that an unnamed \"major insurance company\" was \"on the verge of going bankrupt\" because of delays to the bail-out, which is designed to aid the financial sector by mopping up toxic securities from struggling banks.</p> <p>Critics of the bail-out still have strong reservations - some have pounced on an apparent admission by the Treasury that the figure of $700bn to buy up securities was arbitrary. Forbes magazine quoted a treasury spokeswoman saying that it was not based on any particular data point: \"We just wanted to choose a really large number.\"</p> <p>Such is the freeze on funding that the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, said his state may need a loan of up to $7bn from the federal government to plug a short-term financial gap caused by the credit crunch.</p> <p>\"California and other states may be unable to obtain the necessary level of financing to maintain government operations and may be forced to turn to the federal treasury for short-term financing,\" said Schwarzenegger in a letter to the treasury secretary, Henry Paulson.</p>",
  "<p>At least <a href=\"http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODQ0NWQzODAyMWFlYTkzMDRiYmYzNDU4OWE3M2YzZDY=\">three times</a> last night, Sarah Palin, the adorable, preposterous vice-presidential candidate, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/02/sarah-palin-winks-at-amer_n_131457.html\">winked at the audience</a>. Had a male candidate with a similar reputation for attractive vapidity made such a brazen attempt to flirt his way into the good graces of the voting public, it would have universally noted, discussed and mocked. Palin, however, has single-handedly so lowered the standards both for female candidates and American political discourse that, with her newfound ability to speak in more-or-less full sentences, she is now deemed to have performed acceptably last night.<br> By any normal standard, including the ones applied to male presidential candidates of either party, she did not. Early on, she made the astonishing announcement that she had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/03/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">no intentions of actually answering the queries</a> put to her. \"I may not answer the questions that either the moderator or you want to hear, but I'm going to talk straight to the American people and let them know my track record also,\" she said.</p> <p>And so she preceded, with an almost surreal disregard for the subjects she was supposed to be discussing, to unleash fusillades of scripted attack lines, platitudes, lies, gibberish and grating references to her own pseudo-folksy authenticity. <br> It was an appalling display. The only reason it was not widely described as such is that too many American pundits don't even try to judge the truth, wisdom or reasonableness of the political rhetoric they are paid to pronounce upon. Instead, they imagine themselves as interpreters of a mythical mass of \"average Americans\" who they both venerate and despise.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/03/palin.biden.debate.media\">pronouncing upon a debate</a>, they don't try and determine whether a candidate's responses correspond to existing reality, or whether he or she is capable of talking about subjects such as the deregulation of the financial markets or the devolution of the war in Afghanistan. The criteria are far more vaporous. In this case, it was whether Palin could avoid utterly humiliating herself for 90 minutes, and whether urbane commentators would believe that she had connected to a public that they see as ignorant and sentimental. For the Alaska governor, mission accomplished. <br> There is indeed something mesmerising about Palin, with her manic beaming and fulsome confidence in her own charm. The force of her personality managed to slightly obscure the insulting emptiness of her answers last night. It's worth reading <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/02/debate.transcript/\">the transcript</a> of the encounter, where it becomes clearer how bizarre much of what she said was. Here, for example, is how she responded to Biden's comments about how the middle class has been short-changed during the Bush administration, and how McCain will continue Bush's policies:</p> <blockquote> <p>Say it ain't so, Joe, there you go again pointing backwards again. You preferenced [sic] your whole comment with the Bush administration. Now doggone it, let's look ahead and tell Americans what we have to plan to do for them in the future. You mentioned education, and I'm glad you did. I know education you are passionate about with your wife being a teacher for 30 years, and god bless her. Her reward is in heaven, right? ... My brother, who I think is the best schoolteacher in the year, and here's a shout-out to all those third graders at Gladys Wood Elementary School, you get extra credit for watching the debate.</p> </blockquote> <p>Evidently, Palin's pre-debate handlers judged her incapable of speaking on a fairly wide range of subjects, and so instructed to her to simply disregard questions that did not invite memorised talking points or cutesy filibustering. They probably told her to play up her spunky average-ness, which she did to the point of shtick - and dishonesty. Asked what her achilles heel is - a question she either didn't understand or chose to ignore - she started in on how McCain chose her because of her \"connection to the heartland of America. Being a mom, one very concerned about a son in the war, about a special needs child, about kids heading off to college, how are we going to pay those tuition bills?\"<br> None of Palin's children, it should be noted, is heading off to college. Her son is on the way to Iraq, and her pregnant 17-year-old daughter is engaged to be married to <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5044198/field-guide-levi-johnston\">a high-school dropout and self-described \"fuckin' redneck\"</a>. Palin is a woman who can't even tell the truth about the most quotidian and public details of her own life, never mind about matters of major public import. In her only vice-presidential debate, she was shallow, mendacious and phoney. What kind of maverick, after all, keeps harping on what a maverick she is? That her performance was considered anything but a farce doesn't show how high Palin has risen, but how low we all have sunk.</p>",

  "<p>Joe Biden<a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/politics/wb/179106\"> is coming to town</a>. Locally that is pretty big news. No one that I've spoken to really expected a Democrat to bother with these parts given the size of the town and the immensity of the Republican support dominates the media market around it. Nationally it marks a paradigm shift. It suggests a confidence among Democrats that is pushing them deep into enemy territory.</p> <p>It also signals how central Virginia could be to the outcome of the election. <a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/2008/10/obama-hold-rally-newport-news-Saturday\">Obama is coming to Virginia's eastern shores </a>again tomorrow.</p> <p>Given McCain's now almost certain defeat in Iowa and New Mexico and the tight nature of the race in Colorado, it is difficult to see how he could possibly win the presidency if he doesn't win Virginia, particularly now he has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/03/uselections2008.johnmccain\">pulled his staff out of Michigan</a>. </p> <p>Unless the couple of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2008/oct/03/uselections.polltracker.obama.mccain\">tight polls</a> in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/minnesota\">Minnesota</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/colorado\">Colorado</a> yesterday illustrate a comeback - which is possible but unlikely - then McCain is playing defence everywhere apart from New Hampshire with Obama challenging throughout including North Carolina, Indiana, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ohio\">Ohio</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nevada\">Nevada</a> and finally <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/florida\">Florida</a>.</p> <p>Obama needs 18 more electoral votes than John Kerry had; Virginia has 13. Despite a poll yesterday putting McCain ahead here - the first such result in almost two weeks - the truth is the Republicans have been late to recognize just <a href=\"http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2008-10-02-0123.html\">how vital the state will be</a>. </p> <p>Having thought they wouldn't have to compete here they are opening 12 more offices statewide, making a total of 20. Obama on the other hand could win without Virginia. Yet his campaign already has 45 offices here. </p> <p>In gubernatorial and Senate elections the Democratic strategy has been to rack up huge victories in the northern Virginia, hold your own in Hampton Roads, where Obama will be tomorrow and limit the margins of defeat here in the southwest.</p> <p>Hence Obama and Biden's one-two visit. The Republicans are sure to follow. Virginia is the new Ohio.

  "<p>Sarah Palin's folsky, punchy performance in the vice-presidential debate helped revive her own political reputation today but is unlikely to halt an alarming slide this week in John McCain's White House campaign.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Palin</a>, portraying herself as a feisty representative of small-town America standing up to the Washington elite, matched - and at times even edged ahead of - her Democratic rival, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a>.</p> <p>Although she lifted Republican spirits, the problems fast piling up for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">McCain</a> may prove too many and too big for her to reverse.</p> <p>McCain's decision yesterday to abandon campaigning in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/michigan\">Michigan</a> exposed a narrowing in ambition, signalling he is no longer trying to compete for states the Democrats narrowly took in 2004 but hoping simply to consolidate those Bush won that year.</p> <p>With the Wall Street meltdown dragging him down in the polls and new figures out today showing a ninth straight rise in the monthly jobless figures, this may prove to have been the week the campaign turned decisively in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama's</a> favour.</p> <p>McCain is under pressure to deliver stunning performances in the remaining two debates with Obama, in Nashville, Tennessee on Tuesday and Hempstead, New York the following week.</p> <p>At last night's debate in St Louis, Missouri, the only one between the two vice-presidential candidates, Palin defied critics and comics who had been mocking her all week. Although she frequently betrayed nerves early in the debate, hurrying out words and ideas, she made no gaffes - other than referring to the US commander in Afghanistan, David McKiernan, as \"General McClellan\".</p> <p>Palin stuck to well-rehearsed lines on the economy, climate change, Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan but delivered them with a perkiness that contrasted with a more studied, fact-filled and subdued performance by Biden.</p> <p>Two instant polls suggested that her folksy appeal failed to resonate. A CBS News poll found that 46% of uncommitted voters thought Biden had won, with only 21% saying she had. A CNN one found voters declaring Biden the winner by 51% to 39%.</p> <p>But politicians - some Democrats as well as Republicans - and pundits awarded her at least a draw or even a narrow win.</p> <p>Mike McCurry, who was Bill Clinton's White House press spokesman, summed up the verdict heard most often today when he said: \"Biden won more points, but Palin probably won more hearts.\"</p> <p>Senator Claire McCaskill, part of Obama's retinue, described her as \"very likeable\" but \"there's much more at stake here than who's likeable\".</p> <p>Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, was more sceptical about whether her populist appeal will resonate with voters. \"This was a folksy rendition of the same Bush policies,\" Axelrod told reporters in the so-called Spin Alley outside the debating hall.</p> <p>Palin began the debate with confidence, striding across the carpet, blowing a kiss to the audience and asking Biden, \"Hey, can I call you Joe?\" She sprinkled her comments with folksy phrases like \"doggone\", \"betcha\" and \"darn right\".</p> <p>Foreign policy provided the biggest flashpoint of the debate. After Biden made a case for early withdrawal from Iraq, Palin hesitated, as if caught off guard, but then made an inflammatory statement: \"Your plan is a white flag of surrender in Iraq. It is not what our troops need to hear.\"</p> <p>Biden remained polite throughout the debate, smiling at her, occasionally bemused, even as she goaded him. He betrayed emotion only once, in a moment that may have been rehearsed, when his eyes became moist while describing life as a single father.</p> <p>Although she has softened some of her previously conservative positions, she refused to concede that climate change is man-made. \"I'm not one to attribute every activity of man to the changes in the climate,\" she said.</p> <p>She flew today to Texas for a more restful day fundraising while McCain campaigned in Colorado, a swing state that increases in importance after his abandonment of Michigan.</p> <p>Obama, after a day on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania, was scheduled to have a romantic dinner with Michelle in Chicago to celebrate their 16th wedding anniversary.</p>",

  "<p>The first round of media commentary on the <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/vice_presidential_debate;_ylt=AgPMWUTlBrqn6BDWMHat8bas0NUE\">vice-presidential debate</a> is in. And it looks like the Obama-Biden ticket has survived what was potentially the most treacherous moment of the campaign.</p> <p>Following Sarah Palin's disastrous interviews with <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/Story?id=5782924&amp;page=1\">Charles Gibson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/24/eveningnews/main4476173.shtml\">Katie Couric</a>, there was a real danger she'd be declared the winner of last night's encounter with Joe Biden if she could somehow manage to stand upright and keep talking. All of a sudden it would be Palinmania, round two.</p> <p>That didn't happen. Though Palin is receiving deservedly high marks for her folksy, feisty performance, the substance-free nature of her answers has not gone unnoticed by either the press or the public.</p> <p>Perhaps the most remarkable piece of opinionating today comes from the right. In her Wall Street Journal column, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122300786229301597.html\">Peggy Noonan</a>, former speechwriter for Ronald Reagan and for George Bush's father, weighs in with admiration for Palin's performance skills and contempt for the emptiness behind them.</p> <p>Last month, as you may recall, an open microphone caught Noonan referring to the Palin pick as <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/03/peggy-noonan-mike-murphy_n_123647.html\">\"political bullshit\"</a>. Noonan attempted then to <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122044753790594947.html?mod=todays_columnists\">deny the obvious meaning</a> of those words, but today she makes it clear that she meant what she said.</p> <p>\"There were moments when she seemed to be doing an infomercial pitch for charm in politics. But it was an effective infomercial,\" writes Noonan, adding: \"A question is at what point shiny, happy populism becomes cheerful manipulation.\" Noonan also lambastes the McCain campaign's \"obnoxious political game\" of pretending that criticism of Palin amounts to \"knocking the real America\".</p> <p>Other conservative commentators are more kind to Palin, but they want us to know they can see and hear, too. For instance, <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/642oflyc.asp\">Stephen Hayes of the Weekly Standard pronounces Palin the winner</a>, but then goes on to observe that she was \"utterly incoherent\" at times and \"seemed to settle back on material that she seemed to have memorised.\"</p> <p>So how did she win? \"She won,\" Hayes says, \"because to a vast majority of those who watched the debate tonight she likely came off as a plausible vice-president. And that was all that mattered.\" In other words, Hayes thinks she lost, but condescendingly assumes the rubes will come to a different conclusion.</p> <p>Paul Mirengoff, writing for the conservative <a href=\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives2/2008/10/021672.php\">Power Line blog</a>, tells us: \"Palin, forced by circumstances to prove her merit to an increasingly sceptical electorate, accomplished that mission and then some.\" But he can't leave well enough alone, adding: \"From a technical standpoint, it was Biden who had the more detailed command of the facts (and the greater ability to fudge them). He was able not just to hammer McCain, but to do so at a level of specificity that Palin could not address.\"</p> <p>Perhaps bolstered by snap <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/03/politics/2008debates/main4497138.shtml\">CBS</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/03/debate.poll/index.html\">CNN</a> polls that show viewers thought Biden won by a wide margin, many mainstream and liberal commentators are coming out of their defensive crouch today. If Republicans want to accuse them of liberal bias, they seem to be saying, so be it.</p> <p>Washington Post columnist <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/02/AR2008100204250.html?hpid=topnews\">Dana Milbank is especially brutal</a>, writing that Palin made it through the debate \"with an unnerving mixture of platitudes and cute, folksy phrases that poured from her lips even when they bore no relation to the questions asked.\"</p> <p>At the Politico, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14235.html\">John Harris and Mike Allen's verdict</a> is that \"she got out alive, though there were white-knuckle moments along the way: questions that were answered with painfully obvious talking points that betrayed scant knowledge of the issue at hand.\" Just in case you missed the point, they add: \"It is hard to count any objective measures by which Biden did not clearly win the encounter.\"</p> <p>At the New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/us/politics/03assess.html?partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink\">Adam Nagourney begins more mildly</a>, telling us that Palin managed to meet the ridiculously low expectations that had been set for her performance: \"Sarah Palin made it through the vice-presidential debate on Thursday without doing any obvious damage to the Republican presidential ticket.\"</p> <p>That may be the best outcome the McCain campaign could have hoped for. Palin was good enough that her presence on the ticket, as <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2201336/\">John Dickerson of Slate argues</a>, should become less of a burning issue than it was in the immediate aftermath of her inability to identify any newspapers she reads, any supreme court decisions disagrees with (other than <a href=\"http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=410&amp;invol=113\">Roe v Wade</a>) or any measures her running mate has undertaken over the years to reform the imploding financial system.<br> So it's back to Barack Obama versus John McCain, with their running mates fading into their traditional supporting roles. That hasn't been working so well for McCain in recent weeks, but at least it's a dynamic over which he has some control.</p> <p>Palin's erratic but energetic performance may end the recent run of bad news for the Republican ticket. But it's not going to accomplish anything more than that.</p>",
  "<p>Margaret Beckett's remarkable return to government as housing minister shows Gordon Brown means business in imposing discipline in the cabinet. At the age of 65, when many people would be happy to don carpet slippers and flop out, she will be thrilled to rejoin the political fray.</p> <p>Beckett, who will attend cabinet, replaces Caroline Flint, who becomes Europe minister.</p> <p>Gordon Brown asked her to rejoin the government alongside Peter Mandelson as part of a twin-track approach to strengthen the government's economic team.</p> <p>The prime minister wants an experienced politician to handle the present crisis in housing as prices plummet and repossessions soar.

Apart from four years between her defeat in 1979 and her re-election as MP for Derby South in 1983, she has been in parliament ever since. </p> <p>She supported Tony Benn in his failed deputy leadership bid and famously accused Neil Kinnock of being a \"Judas\" for not supporting him. But she backed Kinnock for the Labour leadership in 1983 and has been conspicuously loyal ever since.</p> <p>She was elected deputy leader of the Labour party in 1992 under John Smith. When Smith died in 1994 she became, temporarily, the leader of the party and gave a moving Commons tribute to Smith. She stood for both leader and deputy leader of Labour. Brown backed her for deputy leader but she lost out to John Prescott. </p> <p>Since 1997 she has been president of the Board of Trade, leader of the Commons, environment secretary and foreign secretary. She was devastated to be sacked by Brown last year as he sought to freshen up his team. But her \"big beast\" presence was missed. </p> <p>Brown appointed her to the prestigious backbench role of chair of the intelligence and security committee, one of the most sensitive and secretive committees in parliament. </p> <p>Under Blair she was regarded as one of the safest pair of hands and popped up regularly to defend the government during media firestorms. </p> <p>Her office had a rare panic in 1997 when she was president of the Board of Trade and the US companies were trying to get into the British gas market. </p> <p>The Guardian obtained documents from the US under the Freedom of Information Act about her meetings in the US. It was not the official words that worried her, but the fact that some of the documents could have contained her doodles of the US characters she was meeting, plus her acerbic comments about them.</p> <p>Luckily for her the US kept them to themselves, avoiding a major diplomatic incident. According to her loyal husband of 29 years, Leo, who acts as her office manager, her doodling is quite extensive, including at cabinet meetings. </p> <p>Perhaps when she finally retires a retrospective exhibition at the Cartoonists' Gallery might be appropriate.

  "<p>Zimbabwe once again attracted remarkable international attention in 2008, this time over highly controversial elections and protracted negotiations between Zimbabwe's main political actors aimed at finding a resolution to the country's political crisis. A Thabo Mbeki brokered power-sharing deal between Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF and the two MDC factions, led by Morgan Tsvangirai and Arthur Mutambara respectively, was finally reached on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2008/sep/15/zimbabwe\">September 15 2008</a>. Southern African Development Community (SADC) leaders celebrated. The international community's response was lukewarm. The likes of Mbeki felt vindicated after years of bearing criticism for his \"quiet diplomacy\". Others, such as hardliners in Zanu-PF and Zimbabwe's security establishment, were disgruntled.</p> <p>For many Zimbabweans inside the country, the deal was a ray of hope because life had become a punishing drudgery. A life of enduring the merciless African sun while queuing for food and a worthless national currency. The wretchedness is compounded by the breakdown of service delivery, skyrocketing inflation, the breakdown of the rule of law, the politicisation of the police, military, civil service and judiciary, and the violence meted out by the state on citizens it ought to protect.</p> <p>In the midst of evident collapse and misery one would have thought that the power-sharing deal will be implemented with alacrity by the three political parties. But Zimbabwe is a difficult country politically. It has a penchant for throwing up the unexpected and many of its current problems have robust historical roots that will not be easily uprooted. It is little surprise that a deadlock has developed between the political parties over the formation of a cabinet to run the country. Zanu-PF is bent on retaining powerful ministerial posts such as state security, defence, home affairs and finance. In spite of the MDC's majority in parliament and Tsvangirai amassing the most votes in the first presidential election round, Zanu-PF still views the MDC as a subordinate party.</p> <p>The Tsvangirai MDC has called on former South African President, Thabo Mbeki, to <a href=\"http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=6&amp;art_id=vn20080922055702968C646034\">continue with his mediation efforts</a> in order to break the deadlock. On the other hand Zanu-PF insists that Mbeki's mediation is not required because there is no deadlock. The contestation over Mbeki's renewed involvement in Zimbabwe is odd. Mbeki is still recovering from the fallout of his humiliating <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i6s82xb7yzOZij2i5fT_xwptVzhg\">resignation</a> as South African president. Whether he still has the verve and authority to continue as mediator is unclear. The new South African president Kgalema Motlanthe has been quick to throw his weight behind Mbeki's proposed continued mediation. Whether this is a reflection of his faith in Mbeki's negotiation skills or is an attempt to duck having to deal with a difficult situation that may haunt his presidency in the manner it did Mbeki's is also unclear.</p> <p>However, the issue is less about whether Mbeki should continue in his role and the various motives at play. Mbeki's efforts reached their peak when the power-sharing deal was signed. There is little he or any other mediator can add to the actual power-sharing process. The onus is on Zimbabwean politicians, particularly those in Zanu-PF, to show political maturity and commitment to the deal for the sake of national interest, and to foster trust and unity between each other and the nation. These qualities are rare in Zimbabwean political culture because in the place of civil dialogue there is uncivil dialogue. In the place of meritocracy there is seniority. In the place of a culture of conflict resolution there are \"degrees in violence\" guaranteeing particular political interests. In the place of issue-based politics there is labelling based on the extent of one's liberation war credentials. Being the dominant nationalist party for approximately 40 years, Zanu-PF is guilty of having generated this political culture.</p> <p>The result is that Zimbabwean politics has been rendered exclusive and impenetrable to those who seek to challenge the views of Zanu-PF. The party is the be all and end all and those outside of it are illegitimate. As former vice-president Simon Muzenda once noted, \"If Zanu-PF puts up a baboon as a candidate, you vote for the baboon.\" Other leading Zanu-PF politicians such as Nathan Shamuyarira boast unselfconsciously that \"the area of violence is an area where Zanu-PF has a very strong, long and successful history\". And while individuals associated with the MDC have attempted to develop reasoned and democratic politics, both MDCs are susceptible to a politics akin to Zanu-PF's. Opposition politics is also a habitat for violence and undemocratic practices. It too is characterised by personalised and immature politics, and contemptible invective such as the Tsvangirai MDC secretary general Tendai Biti's public branding of rival MDC member Gift Chimanikire as a \"smelly fat man who does not bath\" and Chimanikire's retort that Biti \"suffered from diarrhoea\".</p> <p>A melancholy truth about Zimbabwean politics is its lack of gravitas. It is rudimentary, trifling, divisive, intolerant and blind to the national interest \u2013 this is the crux of the matter, not whether Mbeki should stay on as mediator and be called in.</p>",
  "<p>As I wrote in my <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/03/joebiden.sarahpalin\">\"reax\" piece</a> last night, there was one debate moment when Gwen Ifill asked a question for which Palin hadn't been prepped, and it showed. It concerned Dick Cheney's novel constitutional argument about the vice-presidency being a part of two branches of government. </p> <p>I've looked at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/02/debate.transcript/\">the transcript</a> now and here's the exchange:</p> <blockquote> <p>IFILL: Governor, you mentioned a moment ago the constitution might give the vice president more power than it has in the past. Do you believe as Vice President Cheney does, that the Executive Branch does not hold complete sway over the office of the vice presidency, that it it is also a member of the Legislative Branch?</p> <p>PALIN: Well, our founding fathers were very wise there in allowing through the Constitution much flexibility there in the office of the vice president. And we will do what is best for the American people in tapping into that position and ushering in an agenda that is supportive and cooperative with the president's agenda in that position. Yeah, so I do agree with him that we have a lot of flexibility in there, and we'll do what we have to do to administer very appropriately the plans that are needed for this nation. And it is my executive experience that is partly to be attributed to my pick as V.P. with McCain, not only as a governor, but earlier on as a mayor, as an oil and gas regulator, as a business owner. It is those years of experience on an executive level that will be put to good use in the White House also.</p> </blockquote> <p>She seems to be saying here yes indeed, the office of the vice-president well ought to be part of both branches (\"flexibility\") -- what the heck, maybe the judicial branch too! But I don't think she really means that because she simply didn't know what she was talking about. And the transcript doesn't convey the panic that was creeping into her eyes.</p> <p>I'm not suggesting this as a major talking point. It simply struck me, and I feel it's been a bit under-noticed.<br></p>",
  "<p>Watching the vice-presidential debate last night with Roanoke Republicans reminded me of the 1980s Specials song What I like Most About You is Your Girlfriend. </p> <p>Most that I spoke to had not voted for McCain in the primaries. Indeed for some, he was not even the second choice.</p> <p>It was a low-key, sober affair in the back room of a decent restaurant just outside the city centre. It was also fairly small, with barely a dozen people there - but you got the impression that had he not picked Palin, the event wouldn't have taken place at all.</p> <p>James Mixon, who was there with his daughter Katie, wore a badge that said \"Sarah!\" that on closer inspection bore the words \"McCain and Palin\" in far smaller type underneath. He supported Fred Thompson for president and when he dropped out he backed Mitt Romney.</p> <p>\"Republicans were okay with McCain, but not excited,\" he explained. \"He's come on strong since then and by nominating Palin he's indicated to conservatives that he's serious.\"</p> <p>Chris Walters also backed Fred Thompson during the primaries: \"I didn't dislike John McCain. But he is an independent thinker and I'm a conservative,\" he explained.</p> <p>At the outset, it looked as though the central target of their ire was not going to be Joe Biden but the moderator Gwen Ifill, who had been accused of bias because she's writing a book about Obama. </p> <p>\"She's terrible,\" shouted one after a minor stumble at the outset. \"Great question Gwen,\" came another sarcastic jibe within the first five minutes.</p> <p>But within 10 minutes, they were focused on the woman of their dreams. An occasional clap and cheer peppered with affirmations of \"absolutely\".</p> <p>It's not a great surprise that they thought Palin won. When asked why, the issues never really came up. But Biden apparently looked \"shifty eyed\"; Katie Mixon liked that \"she's a strong woman\" and the way both candidates were polite to each other; Gina Wright Hawkins liked her conservatism.</p> <p>If these debates were ever about actual arguments, then I think Biden would have run away with it. From the get-go, Palin insisted that she had no intention of answering Ifill's questions and she kept to her word. But it's not about arguments but performance, and despite the annoying winking and rote-recitation of talking points, I thought Palin edged it too. </p> <p>With expectations set so low and her disastrous previous Couric interviews as trails to some humiliating public meltdown, she kept it together which is all she had to do.</p> <p>Still, you couldn't help feel that some of the Republicans in the room felt they had dodged a bullet. Not necessarily because they thought she would fail, but because the \"liberal media\" would decide she had failed, and the thing they like most about McCain would once again start to look like a liability.</p> <p>From what I've been told, the mood at the \"Drinking Liberally\" event in the centre of town could not have been more different. About 40-50 gathered before two giant screens, drank a lot of beer and played Palin bingo (Don't ask because I don't know). </p> <p>Boy, am I glad I found some Republicans to watch it with. That Democrat one sounded really lame.</p>",
  "<p>The clash of the running mates was, in the end, a rather cordial affair: Sarah Palin turned on the smiling folksiness, Joe Biden went out of his way to be respectful, and neither candidate left the stage in St Louis, Missouri staggering under the burden of a terrible gaffe. In a debate squarely targeting middle-class voters, Palin stuck relentlessly to her prepared points, often all but ignoring moderator Gwen Ifill's questions, but her performance held together, and she easily met the absurdly low expectations that awaited her. Although she frequently betrayed nerves, rattling through words and ideas at speed, the Republican vice-presidential candidate dealt with the Wall Street meltdown, climate change, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, Israel and Darfur with more conviction that she demonstrated in recent, disastrous television interviews, Ewen MacAskill writes in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/03/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">today's Guardian</a>. Palin grew more inflammatory when talk turned from the economy to foreign policy, repeatedly asserting that Biden had supported John McCain's approach to the Iraq war until joining Obama's ticket in order to back a plan that she said would be \"a white flag of surrender in Iraq\". </p> <p>\"She had talking points adequate to fill the 90 seconds on the various topics Ifill tossed her way, and often forced Biden to defend Barack Obama,\" Dana Milbank <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/02/AR2008100204250.html?hpid=topnews\">writes in the Washington Post</a>. \"On the other hand, it wasn't exactly a confidence-builder. Palin, in her 90 minutes on the stage Thursday night, left the firm impression that she is indeed ready to lead the nation - with an unnerving mixture of platitudes and cute, folksy phrases that poured from her lips even when they bore no relation to the questions asked.\"</p> <p>Biden, for his part, just about kept his loquaciousness in check, called Palin \"governor\", and focused his attacks on McCain, whose claims to \"maverick\" status Biden repeatedly sought to undermine. He remained cool almost all the way through but became emotional when he spoke of being a single father, and the death of his daughter and first wife in a car accident.</p> <p>Snap polls by CBS and CNN awarded the debate by some margin to Biden, but it also seems likely that the McCain campaign, and the Republicans' conservative base, will have been reassured by Palin's non-disastrous performance. </p> <p>Earlier yesterday, the McCain campaign announced that they would be winding down their operations in Michigan, apparently giving up on turning the increasingly blue state red. But the Republican National Committee did announce a record fundraising figure of $66m for the month of September - resources that can be used to help garner support for McCain across the country, even though his decision to accept public financing limits the amounts his campaign can raise and spend directly.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Expect the post-debate spin to continue, while Obama campaigns in Pennsylvania, McCain in Colorado, and Palin in Texas. Meanwhile, of course, the historic financial crisis continues: the latest rumours from Capitol Hill last night were that there still weren't enough votes guaranteed for the revised bailout plan to be passed by the House of Representatives. So the cajoling will continue. The vote was due to be held today, but House leaders said they'd postpone it if necessary.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>The latest tracking polls are essentially unchanged: Obama leads in Gallup's poll, 48% to 43%, and in Rasmussen's by 51% to 44%; in both cases, McCain lost one point on the previous day. Meanwhile, a (pre-debate) Washington Post/ABC poll found that Sarah Palin might be becoming far less of a positive force for the McCain campaign: six in 10 voters think she lacks the experience to be an effective president, and a third are now less likely to vote for McCain because of her.</p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"Go to a kids' soccer game on Saturday and turn to any parent there on the sideline and ask them, 'How are you feeling about the economy?' And I'll betcha you're going to hear some fear in that parent's voice, fear regarding the few investments that some of us have in the stock market. 'Did we just take a major hit with those investments?'\" - early in last night's debate, Sarah Palin makes clear her intention to argue from the perspective of Joe Sixpack.</p> <p>\"The issue is how different is John McCain's policy going to be than George Bush's? I haven't heard how his policy is going to be different on Iran than George Bush's. I haven't heard how his policy is going to be different with Israel than George Bush's. I haven't heard how his policy in Afghanistan is going to be different than George Bush's. I haven't heard how his policy in Pakistan is going to be different than George Bush's\" - Biden seizes the opportunity after Palin scolds him for dwelling too much on the past, and on the Bush administration's errors.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/03/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">Palin defies critics and delivers punchy performance in debate against Biden</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/03/sarahpalin.joebiden\">Video: Sarah Palin and Joe Biden clash in vice-presidential debate</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/oct/02/uselections2008.sarahpalin2\">Campaign Diary: How the debate unfolded</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/03/uselections2008.barackobama1\">Fake pollsters try to discredit Obama</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/03/uselections2008.barackobama2\">Aloof but a star: British envoy on Obama</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/us/politics/03assess.html?hp\">NYT: In Debate, Republican Ticket Survives One Test</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1846977,00.html\">Time: The Vice-Presidential Debate Report Cards</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/02/biden-dominates-debate-ac_n_131455.html\">The Huffington Post: Who Won The VP Debate?

  "<p>John Hutton's move to defence secretary is an unlikely switch for the person who - until Peter Mandelson's shock return - was regarded as the most Blairite minister in the cabinet. </p> <p>As a former flatmate of Alan Milburn's and a former colleague of Stephen Byers's, Hutton was known to have some reservations about Gordon Brown taking over the Labour leadership. </p> <p>But Brown is said to have been impressed by the former business secretary's ability to keep his head down and get the job done. </p> <p>Born in London and brought up in Essex, Hutton started his professional life as a law lecturer in Newcastle after securing a degree at Oxford. </p> <p>He unsuccessfully fought seats in the 1987 general election and 1989 European elections for Labour, before being selected for the safe Labour seat of Barrow and Furness - where Britain's nuclear submarines are built. </p> <p>Hutton has repeatedly argued not just for Trident not to be scrapped, but for more nuclear submarines to be built. </p> <p>An MP since 1992, he didn't get a spokesman role in opposition but, having voted for Tony Blair as leader and Margaret Beckett as his deputy in 1994, he became parliamentary private secretary to Beckett when Labour returned to government. </p> <p>Two years later, he became a junior health minister, where he stayed until the 2005 general election. He joined the cabinet after Labour's third victory as chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. </p> <p>However, that was not to last for long. Following the second David Blunkett resignation in December that year, Hutton stepped up to the plate as work and pensions secretary. </p> <p>With the plain-speaking Yorkshireman gone, Blair saw Hutton as a calm, competent pair of hands capably of carrying out a number of unpopular measures.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>10am:</strong> With Alistair Darling and David Miliband and other senior cabinet ministers retaining their jobs, I came into work this morning expecting to write a piece about how this was going to be one of the most boring reshuffles on record. And now Sky is reporting that Peter Mandelson is going to join the government as business secretary! Downing Street sources say they're \"not knocking it down\", which is usually code for it being true.</p> <p>I'll be updating this blog throughout the day as we learn more about the reshuffle. It should be riveting (the reshuffle, I mean, not the blog \u2013 though I hope the blog will be okay too).</p> <p><strong>10.05am:</strong> Derek Draper is on Sky saying \"the whole Labour party is really, really please to have Peter back\". I'm not sure whether that's true. We'll find out in due course. But he's making the point that Mandelson is a \"pretty formidable\" politician, which is undoubtedly true, and that the government needs some PR expertise, which is also undeniable. Draper, of course, used to work for Mandelson but then fell out with him.</p> <p>John Hutton now seems likely to be going to defence. Not sure what's happening to Des Browne yet.</p> <p>A colleague says that John Denham has gone to ground. So he could be on the move.</p> <p><strong>10.15am:</strong> Adam Boulton on Sky says Geoff Hoon, the chief whip, is going to replace Ruth Kelly at transport. He also says that Damian McBride, Brown's political spin doctor, will be moving into a different role.</p> <p>The BBC says Margaret Beckett is tipped for a return. Boulton doesn't know about that, but wonders whether she might replace Mandelson as the UK's European commissioner. As a former foreign secretary she would be well qualified for the role. But there would have to be a byelection. What's her majority? Only 5,657. So maybe not.</p> <p><strong>10.20am:</strong> Des Browne is leaving the government, says Sky. Apparently he was offered another job but refused. So, with Kelly going, too, that's two prominent Catholics leaving the government. At least Browne won't have to take responsibility for the Glenrothes byelection.</p> <p><strong>10.30am:</strong> Nick Brown, the deputy chief whip, is moving up to replace Hoon, according to <a href=\"http://broganblog.dailymail.co.uk/2008/10/mandelson-in-mc.html\">Ben Brogan</a>. That could cause trouble. The Blairites were warning last week that a promotion for Brown could <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/26/labourleadership.gordonbrown\">cause a backlash</a>. But he's been running a parallel whips operation for some time, so I'm not sure how much difference this will make.</p> <p><strong>10.40am: </strong>A colleague points out that it will be Lord Mandelson rejoining the cabinet, because he will have to take a peerage. I'm sure that'll go down well with Labour MPs. I've got to update our story now.</p> <p><strong>11am:</strong> Benjamin Wegg-Prosser, the former Downing Street strategy chief and also a former Mandelson aide, has posted a perceptive analysis of his old boss's return to cabinet <a href=\"http://wpbenjamin.livejournal.com/\">on his blog</a>. Here's the key passage:</p> <blockquote> <p>Last summer Gordon Brown cited the appointments of a collection of minor figures as a evidence that his was a \"government of all the talents\". Like so much over the past 12 months this turned out to be nothing but words. </p> <p>Today Gordon Brown might actually mean it. In returning Peter Mandelson to his rightful place at the heart of government he has drawn to an end a saga which started with a passport application and ended with one of New Labour's creators being jettisoned from office for no obvious reason. </p> <p>Peter Mandelson is one of the few class acts in British politics. His loyalty to the Labour party is without question (though returning to Whitehall was not a straightforward decision for him) and his leadership qualities have never been in doubt. He also now has a wealth of experience at the highest level in global politics have represented Europe in trade talks with heads of government and the WTO. </p> <p>In recent months Gordon Brown sought to re-establish his links with Peter through a series of strategy meetings and many phone calls. It was a reflection on the prime minister's perilous position that he sought advice from someone who he pursued a vendetta against for more than a decade following his failure to replace John Smith as leader of the Labour party in 1994. In that time Gordon Brown's acolytes have held no one in greater contempt than Peter; their reaction to this news, as with most things that they say to the press, is probably unprintable.</p> </blockquote> <p>Wegg-Prosser says he's not sure whether Mandelson can turn things around for Brown, but he says anyone who supports Labour should welcome the appointment.</p> <p><strong>11.15am:</strong> Some new info just in:</p> <p>Hilary Benn's department, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, is being split up. Benn will stay in charge of a slimmed-down department for food. </p> <p>There will be a new department for climate change and energy, headed by Ed Miliband. </p> <p>And Miliband's job as Cabinet Office minister is going to Liam Byrne.</p> <p>The left are already complaining about Mandelson. John McDonnell has said:</p> <blockquote> <p>This is an extraordinary step backwards into the worst elements of the Blair era, to reinstate possibly the most divisive figure in Labour's recent history.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Blair used to operate on the basis that the more unpopular a move was with the left, the better. On that basis, Brown has secured a triumph.</p> <p><strong>11.25am:</strong> Brown is in Luton unveiling a police memorial. We've just seen in on Sky. So is the reshuffle over? Or on hold? Or is someone else running it? </p> <p>McBride is definitely moving into a backroom role, we're told. The FT says he's going to be replaced by Justin Forsyth, an international development special adviser in Downing Street and, <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2008/10/gordons-new-spin-doctor/\">as the FT says</a>, \"a very nice fellow\".</p> <p><strong>11.50am:</strong> Here's some reaction from the blogosphere to the Mandelson appointment. Martin Bright at the <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/martin-bright/2008/10/peter-mandelson-gordon-news\">New Statesman</a> says it's \"great news for British journalism\". Sunder Katwala from the <a href=\"http://nextleft2.blogspot.com/2008/10/mandelsons-return.html\">Fabian Society</a> says this could increase the importance of Europe as an issue, and as a dividing line between the parties. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.order-order.com/2008/10/whatever-happened-to-end-to-spin.html\">Guido Fawkes</a> says it's Brown's attempt to ensure that he's no longer the most unpopular member of the cabinet. Daniel Finkelstein at <a href=\"http://timesonline.typepad.com/comment/2008/10/help-wanted-are.html\">Comment Central</a> wants to know if there's any precedent for someone making a second cabinet comeback. And Philip Johnston at the <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/philip_johnston/blog/2008/10/03/peter_mandelson_return_is_a_sign_of_weakness\">Telegraph</a> says the appointment is a sign of Brown's weakness.</p> <p><strong>12.15pm:</strong> The BBC have been tipping Margaret Beckett for the Cabinet Office \"enforcer\" role. I'm told that's wrong. She is joining the government, but not at the Cabinet Office, where Byrne is heading.</p> <p>So where is she going. Housing? (Not, technically, a cabinet post - Caroline Flint only attends the cabinet. She doesn't belong to it.)</p> <p><strong>12.20pm:</strong> There are two names being mentioned as in the frame for Mandelson's job: Patricia Scotland, the attorney general, and Cathy Ashton. They are both in the Lords (Ashton is the leader of the Lords), so there would not have to be a byelection.</p> <p>Alternatively, will Brown appoint a Tory? That would reinforce his credentials as a pluralist. But I expect Ken Clarke would rather hold on for a cabinet job in a David Cameron government. There's been speculation that he could become leader of the Commons.</p> <p>Will the new UK commissioner get to keep the powerful trade portfolio? I'm told that when a commissioner steps down mid-term, the national replacement normally inherits the job. But the commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, has the final say and he can reshuffle jobs if he wants to. It has happened before.</p> <p><strong>12.35pm:</strong> The Lib Dems have issued a press notice saying: \"Resurrecting ex-ministers from the political graveyard is not going to breathe new life into Gordon Brown's zombie government.\" William Hague is about to issue his own statement on behalf of the Conservatives describing the appointment as \"an act of desperation\". Apparently they've also been compiling a list of all the things Brown and Mandelson have said about each other in the past, which should be fun.</p> <p>But should the Tories really be so confident that this appointment will backfire? I've just spoken to one of Cameron's lieutenants who says he's \"genuinely bemused\" by what Brown's done and who can't work out how Brown can benefit from the appointment of someone unpopular with the public. But Mandelson was getting a bad press even in 1997, and his relationship with Brown in those days was truly dire. That did not stop the two men masterminding an election campaign that kneecapped the Conservative party. I suspect that, in private, some Tories won't quite be so confident.</p> <p>Latest rumour: Margaret Beckett for leader of the Lords.</p> <p><strong>1.10pm:</strong> Adam Boulton says the former Sun editor, David Yelland, is going to Downing Street to revamp Brown's communications operation. I'm off to refresh our news stories, but I'll be back here soon.</p> <p><strong>2.10pm: </strong>I was away from the desk for a moment, but I gather that Sky are now saying that Yelland won't be going to Downing Street.</p> <p>Boulton's now tipping Beckett for housing. So where's Flint going?</p> <p>Mandelson, apparently, will be doing an interview outside No 10 at about 2.45pm.</p> <p><strong>2.25pm: </strong>This is from <a href=\"http://blogs.independent.co.uk/openhouse/2008/10/return-of-the-j.html\">John Rentoul's blog:</a> \"Peter Mandelson, back in the cabinet? Even Jesus had only two comings.\" It's a neat joke, but \"two comings\" is a bit indelicate for my taste. How about: \"Even Jesus only had one resurrection.\"</p> <p>Nick Robinson, as usual, has a good summary of what's going on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/\">on his blog</a>. His conclusion:</p> <blockquote> <p>So, what's behind Gordon Brown's moves? The economic challenge, the strategic challenge and the threat to his position.</p> <p>Downing Street are presenting this as a strengthening of the cabinet to face the economic crisis - drawing on Peter Mandelson's global experience and contacts whilst creating a new department to handle energy.</p> <p>It's also clear that the PM wants political ballast - Mandelson brings huge strategic and presentational experience whilst Margaret Beckett has long experience of government and the stature to knock ministerial heads together.</p> <p>Finally, and crucially, Brown is trying to shore up his position in the Labour party. The message to the plotters is, in effect, if Mandelson is on my side, isn't it time you were? The people that founded New Labour - Brown, Blair (who's in regular contact with him), Mandelson and Alastair Campbell - are said to have put aside their differences to work together again.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3pm:</strong> He's back. Mandelson's just walked into Downing Street, having done a brief doorstep with the TV crews, wearing on his face the most enormous grin you've ever seen. \"Like the cat that's got the cream,\" according to the BBC's James Landale. </p> <p>Mandelson said he had had his \"ups and downs\" with Brown, that he had not expected to be appointed, but that he was glad to serve. \"It's all hands to the deck.\"</p> <p>Sky are saying that Jan Royall will be the new leader of the Lords. She had been chief whip in the Lords, but now she's heading for the cabinet. She was a longstanding Kinnock aide. Mandelson first made his name in that era too. The return of the Kinnockites?</p> <p><strong>3.50pm:</strong> I've just come out of the Downing Street briefing and we've got the full list of the cabinet. It's as we've been reporting. Here are the points that are new, or that we could not confirm as fact earlier:</p> <p>Jan Royall becomes leader of the Lords.</p> <p>Jim Murphy becomes Scottish secretary.</p> <p>Nick Brown is chief whip, but not in cabinet. He will attend instead without full membership.</p> <p>Margaret Beckett replaces Caroline Flint as housing minister. She will attend cabinet, but not as a full member.</p> <p>Caroline Flint replaces Murphy as Europe minister, attending cabinet when Europe is discussed.</p> <p>Tony McNulty becomes employment minister, attending cabinet but not as a full member.</p> <p>Stephen Carter, Brown's chief of staff, is becoming a minister for communications, technology and broadcasting in the Lords.</p> <p>Paul Myners, chairman of the Guardian Media Group, is becoming a City minister.</p> <p>And Lord Drayson is rejoining the government as science minister.</p> <p>Brown is doing a press conference with Alistair Darling in Downing Street shortly.</p> <p><strong>4.50pm:</strong> The press conference is over. Asked why he was appointing Mandelson, Brown said: \"Serious people are needed for serious times.\" When Brown told the Labour conference that it was \"no time for a novice\" I thought that was a cheap conference slogan. But I now realise it's a strategy.</p> <p>Barry Gardiner, one of the Labour MPs calling for a leadership election before the conference, has just been on News 24 and his reaction was very significant. He said:</p> <blockquote> <p>This is the Gordon Brown that many of us have wanted to see for about a year. It shows decisiveness, it shows leadership and being able to put aside personal animosity in the way that he has been able to do with Peter Mandelson is immensely good.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>5.20pm:</strong> There's an interesting summary of views from the Times' commentariat on <a href=\"http://timesonline.typepad.com/comment/2008/10/phil-collins-if.html\">Daniel Finkelstein's blog</a>, which is worth a read if you're still trying to make sense of this all. The general consensus seems to be that it's a brilliant short-term move, but that in the long-run it will fail.</p> <p>If there are points in politics for originality, then Brown has triumphed. I started working in the lobby in 1994 and I can't remember a government appointment that came as such a surprise, with such game-changing potential. Patrick Wintour wrote about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/02/davidcameron.toryconference\">\"Hail Mary\" pass</a> the other day. If you're looking for a good example of one, this is it.</p> <p>Nick Robinson suggested Brown was in effect forming an economic war cabinet. Another colleague mentioned the Ramsay MacDonald coalition government. But will the voters be impressed? And will Brown and Mandelson (and their allies) manage to stop feuding? Who knows? I really have no idea.</p> <p>Still, you never get bored in this job.</p> <p>I've got to wind up now. Thanks for reading and for the comments.</p>",
  "<p>Heading into last night's debate between the vice-presidential candidates, Joe Biden and Sarah Palin, there was as much speculation about the nominees' bearing, body language and tone as about the substance.</p> <p>Voters and political professionals alike wondered if Biden, a veteran senator, would appear condescending and smug facing off against a much less experienced woman. Would Palin, the Alaska governor since 2006, demonstrate a command of national and international affairs, or would she reprise embarassing flubs that marked her initial few television appearances?</p> <p>Guardian America watched the debate with Julia Piscitelli, the assistant director of American University's Women and Politics Institute and a Democratic debate coach and media trainer.

Palin being the more interesting and novel candidate, Piscitelli focused more on her.</p> <p>Piscitelli said Biden largely avoided the traps set for him by the media and the Republicans. Elected senator in 1972, he nevertheless did not inappropriately flaunt his greater experience, nor did he come across as overbearing or bored as he did in some of the Democratic primary debates. Palin performed well, easily surpassing the low expectations set for her by Democrats, Republicans and the news media. Palin was \"very self-possessed\" and her populist tone on economic issues worked smoothly, Piscitelli said. She was unable to match Biden on foreign policy, but who in the US could, Piscitelli asked.</p> <p>Piscitelli noted that when she was forced into uncomfortable territory, for instance on financial services deregulation and certain foreign policy topics, Palin reverted to a \"cutesy, folksy\" tone that Piscitelli found unseemly.</p> <h2>On the candidates' attire</h2> <p>Palin \"needs to combat cute\", and the \"serious suit\" flattered her while adding gravitas. \"She can walk in those size heels, and not every woman can. I'm impressed.\"</p> <p>Biden's dark suit was \"classic, presidential\". \"The blue tie, the pale blue, is always a good choice. But his knot's a little tight.\"</p> <h2>On the opening</h2> <p>\"She walked right into his space, which actually was good. She strode right in, and he was a little slower.\" Palin asked if she could address Biden by his first name, and said she was pleased to meet him. \"It underscores what their camp is trying to do, which is to say 'She's new, she's fresh'\".</p> <h2>On the debate</h2> <p>Biden launched an attack on McCain's healthcare proposal, saying the Arizona senator would treat employer-sponsored health insurance as taxable income. He threw around several different dollar figures, and even Piscitelli and Guardian America got lost. \"He started off doing a good job at explaining things in simple language,\" Piscitelli said, \"but it's going a bit off the rails. He could have simplified it\".</p> <p>The moderator, Gwen Ifill, asked if there was any way Palin as vice-president would curtail her campaign proposals in light of the growing economic troubles. Palin responded: \"There is not. And how long have I been at this, like five weeks? So there hasn't been a whole lot that I've promised, except to do what is right for the American people.\"</p> <p>Piscitelli groaned at that statement. \"The biggest knock against her is she's not qualified, and now she's saying, let me remind everyone that I've only been at this \u2013 whatever this is \u2013 for five weeks. She's using it when she wants to, like don't hold me to the higher standard. That was an 'I don't want to answer the question' type of answer that I think is a big turnoff.\"</p> <p>Piscitelli praised Biden for not calling attention to Palin's non-answer. \"He would just sound like a tattle-tale.\"</p> <p>When the debate turned to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Palin defended McCain's rejection of a timetable for withdrawal of US troops from Iraq and touted his support for the \"surge\" in US forces in Iraq. Piscitelli noted the war's deeply unpopularity across the electorate as a whole, but especially among women. \"Women will not stick with her if she's for the war.\"</p> <p>Palin said: \"You guys opposed the surge. The surge worked. Barack Obama still can't admit the surge works.\" Piscitelli said Palin was \"talking cute about the surge\" which would not play well with voters.</p> <p>Palin pronounces \"nuclear\" as \"nuke-you-ler\", like George Bush. \"It grates on my nerves,\" said Piscitelli. She said Palin and her supporters may see that as a humble colloquialism, but it makes her sound uneducated and uninterested in speaking the language correctly. \"Kids are listening to that,\" Piscitelli said with a sigh.</p> <p>Palin discussed her meeting with the former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, saying \"he shared with me his passion for diplomacy\". Piscitelli said it made Palin sound like a naif, because Kissinger is known worldwide as a diplomat. When asked to discuss Darfur, Biden called for a \"no-fly zone\" and for mobilising African Union forces. Asked to respond, Palin opened with: \"Oh, yeah, it's so obvious I'm a Washington outsider. And someone just not used to the way you guys operate.\"</p> <p>Piscitelli said Palin could not hope to compete with Biden on the issue directly, so she deflected it. \"She's gonna have to answer it that way because she really doesn't have any choice.\"</p> <p>Piscitelli noted that during the discussion of same-sex marriage Palin never used the terms gay, homosexual or same-sex.</p> <p>Ifill asked the candidates to speculate on how they would govern if they assumed the presidency. Biden said: \"The people in my neighbourhood \u2026 know they've been getting the short end of the stick\" during the Bush tenure and expected the same from a McCain presidency. Palin responded: \"Say it ain't so, Joe, there you go again pointing backwards again \u2026 Now doggone it, let's look ahead and tell Americans what we have to plan to do for them in the future.\" She offered a \"shout-out to all those third graders at Gladys Wood elementary school\".</p> <p>Piscitelli said: \"We're an hour-plus into this debate. They're really having a good debate about issues, and people are responding to it, so you don't need to cute it up. She didn't need it. She's actually doing a decent job. She doesn't need to fall back on that.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/johnlewis\">John Lewis</a> today reported an 8.3% drop in weekly sales at its department stores, blaming the turmoil in financial markets and the recent good weather.</p> <p>The employee-owned group, seen as a barometer of Britain's retail sector, said sales at its upmarket Waitrose supermarkets were down 0.7% in the week to September 27. </p> <p>John Lewis has been losing ground to discount chains such as Aldi and Lidl - currently the fastest-growing grocers in the country - as consumers look to save on their weekly shopping.</p> <p>\"A combination of unseasonably sunny, warm weather and a huge amount of coverage of the global economic situation added together to give a very tough trading week,\" Dan Knowles, the director of selling operations, said. </p> <p>\"The market is tougher than it's been for a long while.\"</p> <p>Sales fell at all but one of the John Lewis department stores that have been open for more than a year. </p> <p>They only grew on Monday and the worst day of the week was Saturday, when the sun shone across the country. </p> <p>Sales of home-related products slumped 13.3%, while electricals and home technology sales were down 7.2% and fashion fell 6%. </p> <p>Despite the weak performance, John Lewis said it was continuing to take market share. </p> <p>The only areas to see any growth were fitted kitchens, large electrical items and flooring, which performed strongly as Britons improve their homes instead of moving.</p> <p>\"A second week of poor sales from the department stores,\" the retail analyst Freddie George, at Seymour Pierce, said. </p> <p>\"It was also a very poor week for Waitrose despite easier weather comparatives, indicating that consumers are continuing to trade down from the high end food retailers.\"</p> <p>While Waitrose refuses to take its food offering downmarket, it has reintroduced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/22/foodanddrink.supermarkets\">cheaper meat cuts</a> such as Bath chaps -the lower half of a pig's cheeks - pig trotters and ox cheeks. </p> <p>Some out of town John Lewis stores suffered big falls in sales - Cribbs Causeway was down 25%, Southampton 24% and High Wycombe 22%. Online sales also continued to slow to 15% from a previous run rate of more than 30%.</p> <p>\"Given that John Lewis' department store sales are generally seen as a good bellwether for the health of consumer spending, the marked deterioration in sales over the past two weeks suggests that that the heightened turmoil in the financial sector ... is significantly hitting consumer confidence and spending,\" the analyst Howard Archer, of Global Insight, said.</p> <p>Conditions on the high street have worsened, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/02/marksspencer.retail1\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a>, the UK's largest clothing retailer, suffering its worst sales performance in years yesterday. </p> <p>Several smaller firms have collapsed into administration, including the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/01/retail.creditcrunch\">young fashion label Miss Sixty</a>. </p> <p>The outdoor retailer Blacks Leisure today warned of a wider than expected first-half loss, blaming poor sales in August. </p> <p>Its boardwear business, which includes the Freespirit, Mambo, Animal and O'Neill brands, suffered a 16% fall in like-for-like sales in the first half.</p>",
  "<p>When the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/03/AR2008100300074.html\">vice-presidential debate</a> starts, Sarah Palin looks so terrified that it actually makes me physically uncomfortable to watch. But within two winks and a \"Joe Sixpack,\" my discomfort has given way to contempt and equilibrium is restored.</p> <p>Pretty quickly, it's evident that anyone tuning in to the debate hoping to see a trainwreck will be disappointed \u2013 and, by its end, the only thing wrecked are my associates who took a shot every time Palin <a href=\"http://www.palinbingo.com/\">uttered the words</a> \"Alaska\" and \"maverick\" and \"taxes.\"</p> <p>What I <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/02/debate.transcript/index.html\">notice most pointedly</a> is that Joe Biden's answers have been internalised and Palin's have been memorised. He speaks about the minutiae of foreign policy with the ease and surety and fond familiarity that I might speak about the details of circa-1987 Britpop b-sides - it's part of his soul. She sounds like a jukebox whose every slot is filled with a different Republican talking point. J17: Lower taxes. H21: Drill, baby, drill. His responses are the result of years of immersion in these issues; hers the result of days of cramming. And it shows.</p> <p>Considering that Biden was expected to call her \"Tootsie\" and Palin was expected to fall off the stage, I'm vaguely surprised to be bored to hell after the first hour. I may have fallen asleep if Palin's mispronunciation of nuclear didn't keep compelling me to jam pencils into my ears.</p> <p>My friend Devo calls me to rant about the unrelenting tackiness of Palin's glittering flag lapel pin and how she reminds him of the Republican lady at his childhood church who didn't want black people to join the congregation, happily chirping: \"I just think they'd be happier somewhere else!\"</p> <p>I tell him if she says \"maverick\" one more time, I'm going on a five-state killing spree.</p> <p>There are a few gaffes \u2013 Palin conflates Obama and Biden as \"O'Biden\" at one point, refers to the top US military commander in Afghanistan, General David McKiernan, as <a href=\"http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/10/the_mcclellan_factor.php\">General McClellan</a>, and refers to the economic crisis as a \"toxic mess on Main Street affecting Wall Street,\" which, one assumes, is precisely backwards from what she intended. And there were some stupid moments, as when moderator Gwen Ifill asks the question to which her colleague Jim Lehrer couldn't get an answer to during the first presidential debate, regarding what each administration might have to sacrifice to pay for promised tax cuts, and Palin replies that she's \"been at this five weeks\" and hasn't had time to make any promises.</p> <p>And there is one clearly newsworthy moment, when Palin notes she would like to <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/opinion/walsh/election_2008/2008/10/03/palin_flubs/\">expand the authority of the vice-presidency</a> \u2013 a fairly shocking comment, following on the heels of the significantly empowered vice-presidency of Dick Cheney. It is almost a throwaway remark, but probably the most controversial of the night and the most deserving of further scrutiny - and, as is so often the case, the least likely to receive it.</p> <p>But it is largely a pretty tame affair. Blah, blah, blah, taxes. Blah, blah, blah, foreign policy. Biden is substantive, Palin is rhetorical. Palin aims for <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/02/AR2008100204250.html\">folksy</a>; achieves shticky. Biden, usually a master of the debate one-liner (\"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DteDRD6cbbM&amp;feature=related\">a noun, a verb, and 9/11</a>\"), gets off nothing better than calling McCain's healthcare proposal a \"bridge to nowhere.\" There are breaks in the contentiousness while the two aspiring veeps find agreement on discriminating against gays and loving Israel. (But what about gay Israelis? I am left to wonder.)</p> <p>When it's over, the Republicans in the spin room are ecstatic with Palin's performance, and the talking point seems to be that Joe Biden was \"looking backwards\" because he kept referencing the Bush administration. Apparently, the McCain campaign's desperation to distance themselves from the still-current Republican president has ripped a hole in the space-time continuum and they exist somewhere in a future America where the idiot king has taken his leave back to Crawford or whatever other hamlet will have the misfortune of bearing his long overdue retirement.</p> <p>The rest of us will have to wait for November 4.</p>",
  "<p>This week has not been a good one for the Republicans, and certainly not for Sarah Palin. She has seen her popularity plummet, in light of her <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/10/palin-couric.html\">interviews with CBS's Katie Couric</a>, the subsequent excellent parody courtesy of <a href=\"http://politicalhumor.about.com/od/sarahpalin/ig/Sarah-Palin-Pictures/I-Can-See-Russia.htm\">Saturday Night Live's Tina Fey</a>, and public criticism of her by <a href=\"http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDZiMDhjYTU1NmI5Y2MwZjg2MWNiMWMyYTUxZDkwNTE=\">Republican commentator Kathleen Parker</a>. There was, therefore, a lot at stake for the Republican ticket in <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/02/debate.transcript/index.html\">last night's vice presidential debate</a>. </p> <p>Expectations of Palin's performance were low, with some predicting that she'd have to do little more than regurgitate her talking points in order to come across well during the debate. The truth is, however, that a lightweight like Palin was never going to win a debate against Joe Biden, who is known for his debating prowess as well as his knowledge of the issues.</p> <p>Biden, nevertheless, also came to the table with his own set of challenges. Commentators had been calling on him to be restrained and strike the right balance in his reaction to Palin so as to not be charged with either being too heavy handed or overly soft on her. Known for his gaffes, he was also under pressure to not <a href=\"http://features.csmonitor.com/politics/2008/10/02/bidens-supreme-challenge-no-gaffes/\">say anything stupid</a>, as he sometimes does. </p> <p>Judging by some of the post-debate coverage, Republican commentators are happy with Palin's performance \u2013 which is to be expected. She didn't do terribly, although Saturday Night Live will no doubt have sourced some great material tonight including her inability to pronounce \"nuclear\" and her cringe-worthy shout outs to third graders at Gladys Wood Elementary School. </p> <p>There is no doubt that this debate was <a href=\"http://us.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/03/debate.poll/index.html\">an all-out win for Joe Biden</a>, who came across as a political heavyweight, affirming \u2013 to me, at least \u2013 that Sarah Palin, who is in no way, shape or form ready to be vice-president. </p> <p>First of all, I am not sure that what I saw tonight can accurately be called a debate. At the least, it was a very uneven one, with the impressive Joe Biden doing the majority of the serious debate and discussion. He comprehensively, confidently and substantively discussed issues like healthcare, foreign policy and the economy while Sarah Palin, on the other hand, insisted on not answering the questions fully, declaring at one point: \"I may not answer the questions the way you or the moderator want to hear, but I'm going to talk to the American people.\" This she did by sticking hard to the only issues that she seems to know about: tax, energy, John McCain's \"maverick\" nature and her role as governor of Alaska. </p> <p>The strategies of both sides were clear from the beginning. Biden's was to focus on the issues, set out Obama's policies and directly criticise McCain. He did this well, giving powerful and compelling arguments why McCain is far from being a maverick, as well as dealing a strong punch when he said: \"I haven't heard how [McCain's] policy is going to be different on Iran than George Bush's. I haven't heard how [McCain's] policy is going to be different with Israel than George Bush's\u2026 It may be. But so far, it is the same as George Bush's. And you know where that policy has taken us.\"</p> <p>Palin's strategy was to talk directly to the average American voter, even if it meant veering wildly off topic or ignoring the questions altogether. Although she looked directly into the camera most of the time and spoke with zeal and passion, at some points, I had to ask myself exactly what she was talking about. </p> <p>The over-use of buzz word such as \"hockey moms\" and \"Joe Sixpack\" did give the impression that Palin is an ordinary person. But when you're in the running to be vice-president of the most powerful nation in the world, that is not necessarily a good thing. Biden, on the other hand, came across as commanding, highly knowledgeable and statesman-like - someone you could trust in a crisis. </p> <p>At times I had to ask myself if Palin belonged to a ground-breaking new independent party, and not the Republican party, as she continued to refer to the problems of \"the federal government\" as if they are in opposition to her and McCain. In traditional Republican style, Palin also misrepresented Obama on a number of issues including how his tax breaks would affect American families. Each time, however, Biden clearly pointed out the <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/10/02/vice-presidential-debate-live-blogging/\">inaccuracies</a>. </p> <p>Although Biden had been warned not to make any condescending gestures, he was unable to contain the large grin that crossed his face many times during the debate, as Palin rambled, fudged and at times simply said some nonsensical things. Despite the smile, he was admirably restrained. When Palin talked about increased vice-presidential powers, Biden did not \u2013 as he could have done \u2013 directly contradict her. He simply set out the facts, and then pointed out that \"Everyone should understand that.\"</p> <p>Biden was clever last night, showing that two can play Palin's \"ordinary American\" game. When she talked about families and what people talk about across the dining table, he talked about his family, actually seeming at one point to <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/politics/2008/10/02/sot.debate.biden.emotional.cnn\">choke on his words</a> as if about to cry. </p> <p>As I've said before, most Republicans will be content with Palin's performance, while most Democrats will be happy with Biden's. But what about those all-important undecided voters? If they have any sense, in watching this debate, they will see that a McCain-Palin ticket is not the way forward.</p>",
  "<p>Fashion-forward points first - just in case you missed it and everyone else is talking about the politics stuff - Sarah Palin wore a hairdo that was neither up, nor down, but both up AND down, perhaps demonstrating some kind of openness to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/us/politics/03debate.html\">bipartisan nature</a>. Or maybe she's just mixing it up a bit. The biggest flag-pin I've ever seen sits on the lapel of a sober black suit. </p> <p>Joe Biden, meanwhile, went with a nice light blue tie that initially looks like it might have a balloon painted on it (but which turns out to be the shadow of the microphone, disappointingly) and a slightly bouffant comb-over. </p> <p>Palin went with frameless glasses, and Biden with a lipless smile. Or at least toplipless. His top lip seems to have given generously to his lower lip fund, but been left rather short-changed on it's own behalf.</p> <p>It took under five minutes to hear the first \"You betcha!\" from the right-hand side of the stage. Following hard on its heels is a wink and a mention of every parent standing by the side of their kids soccer match. Anyone who had \"folksyisms\", \"winking\" or \"youth sports\" as the three-finger sip in their VP debate drinking game would, then, have been quite happily pissed by ten minutes in.</p> <p>But for the people who picked \"Maverick\" as their liquor-buzzword of choice, it was debatable whether they'd run out of booze or consciousness first. It must have been said three dozen times \u2026 starting slowly, with Governor Palin bringing up the fact that Senator McCain apparently is one (who knew?!) at least once every five minutes, before Biden finally lost his temper and took the word to task. \"Maverick! McCain is not a maverick! Maverick?\" he repeated, over and over again, making both his point and a lot of people drunk all at once.</p> <p>The reactions were telling - both VPs seemed to talk to each other more than the presidential ones did in the first debate, and listen to each other too. But, behind the principal speaker, in soft bokeh you could hear and see the reactions of the non-speaker when the other was talking. </p> <p>For Palin, it was a grin. A wide grin sometimes, and sometimes a little grin. And sometimes a worried grin. And sometimes an amused grin, but always the familiar Palin grin. \"Prisidential pallitiks? I've only bin attit five wiks!\" she said, with a little shrug of the shoulders. So it's strange that she should be so familiar by now. Of course, the fact that she's a perfectly manicured and much-publicised cross between <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/09/30/obama_notes_remarkable_resembl.html\">Tina Fey</a> and <a href=\"http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Laura_Roslin\">President Roslin of Battlestar Gallactica</a> is now so familiar as to go without mentioning (not quite without mentioning, obviously. I just have. Again.) but frankly, like most world citizens, I probably couldn't have picked Biden out of out of a line up of old men before tonight. Not so now. Now I'd recognise him anywhere: he's the one with the lack of lip and the big sighs.</p> <p>Yes, on the other side of the stage, Biden's common reaction was to sigh, loudly. And repeatedly. At some point I expected to see the camera pull back and find him being squeezed by a giant octopus to the point of almost complete deflation, so great is the rush of air coming out of him. Commendably, he makes it to the end of the debate without running out of breath entirely, though you worry it was a pretty close call. </p> <p>It was the moment when Palin brought everything back to knowing what real life was like around the kitchen table - how real people feel as parents, as families, as regular members of the workforce. And with that, Biden came back as a human being - breaking his very stately senator's mask with a moment of emotion - \"Just because I've been in politics this long, don't think that I don't know what it's like to sit at that table, to bring up a family, to not know if one of your children [pause, break] is going to make it' was the gist, though not the transcript. A quick look around internet reactions and people were touched by this it seemed - not McCain-Palin supporters so much, who saw it as a tacit playing of a gender card against the woman onstage - but Democrats seemed to like it, and on CNN's \"undecideds\" graph, the line went snaking up to toward the top.</p> <p>Generally, though, the undecideds of Ohio seem to stay, well, undecided (not that I'm suggesting we try to help them out with that). The line pootled up toward the top around the at the mention of several buzzwords, and hovered around the middle for pretty much everything else. When people made good, clear points, not filled with high-falutin' senator speak or with stupid folksy phrases like \"high-falutin' senator speak\", they did well, and hopefully the next presidental debate will be more exciting having learned from that.</p> <p>But many people were watching for Palin. Having sucked in all the sketches and the jokes and the YouTube mashups, it seemed that many people were watching hoping for a <a href=\"http://failblog.org/2008/10/02/clarity-fail/\">FAIL</a> of epic proportions. Perhaps she would say that her idea of a perfect president was Donny Osmond. Perhaps she would misunderstand a simple question, with hilarious consequences. And did she? No, of course she didn't. She couldn't pronounce nuclear, driving pedants mad with a constant reference to \"nukular\" things. But many many people do that, and most don't have such a cute little grin while doing it, right?</p> <p>The pundits afterward agreed that she'd patched up quite a lot of the damage done by media mocking over the last week, and through careful retelling of points and buzzwords close to the heart of the campaign, appeared far more vice-presidential than a lot of detractors (and comedy-show writers, most likely) were hoping for. But she did very often come across as an impressive governor of a small-populationed state. And: \"As long as we all work together for the greater good, everything will be ok,\" she said, of her hopes for her time in Washington. It's a lovely thought. And if possible, that would be great. It would be lovely to think that a cheery smile and a wink would be enough to move Washington, and, in fact, that would be great. But it probably isn't. </p> <p>Did Biden win? He didn't counter her attacks on him, he didn't attack her (lack of) record. He didn't have a top lip. But that doesn't make him a bad person (look at Kenneth Brannagh). Yes, Biden may have lost his decorum and his rag at one point but whether that is too much has yet to be seen. And at least he can pronounce nuclear - although his use of the word \"Bosniacs\" is possibly something to look into.</p>",
  "<p>Well, after all that build-up, the great debate wasn't all that great. And it probably won't end up changing very much.</p> <p>Let's cut to the chase: Sarah Palin passed the what-is-she-doing-here test. The frantic-paced format, with few real follow-up questions, was good for her. Moderator Gwen Ifill refrained from asking any probing questions about, say, Troopergate or her abortion position, that would have put her on the spot and forced her to defend her record. </p> <p>Also, Palin was able to sort of plow ahead rhetorically and eat up clock. She made no really humiliating mistakes, although she teetered on the edge once \u2013 the debate's most fascinating moment, which we'll get to. </p> <p>There were many occasions when she didn't actually answer the question that was asked. There was even one occasion when she said she wasn't going to answer the question, about John McCain's healthcare policy. How much that bothers people I don't know, but it began to show as the debate wore on, I think, particularly during the foreign policy section. But she did lift herself into a post-Couric phase. For now, she's not an embarrassment any more. </p> <p>The fascinating moment. It came at 10:15pm. The one really interesting question Ifill asked was about Dick Cheney's theory of the vice-presidency. At one point in 2007, as Cheney was trying not to comply with an executive order on classified information, he actually <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/06/22/cheney_asserts_hes_part_of_the_legislative_branch/\">asserted that the vice-president wasn't part of the executive branch</a> (he argued this on the grounds that under the Constitution, the vice-president also presides over the Senate). Ifill asked both if they agreed with Cheney.</p> <p>Biden casually delivered an excellent answer about Cheney's serial assaults on the Constitution, one of his best of the night. As for Palin \u2013 here, finally, with just 15 minutes to go, came the first question for which she clearly hadn't been prepped. On everything else \u2013 the economy, Wall Street, healthcare, Iraq, Iran \u2013 she'd been given her talking points and she'd (mostly) hit them. But this question wasn't on the list. Her answer was utter gibberish. For 90 seconds, the Couric Palin returned. I'm pretty sure I even heard her say in there somewhere that the powers of the vice-presidency should be expanded. That's just what we need. </p> <p>During that question, she looked like an automaton whose batteries were running out on her, causing brain-wire shorts. But the next question was expected. Education or something. Boy, was she ready for that one.</p> <p>Let's talk base v swing voters. I think the conservative base certainly leaves the debate relieved. Some portions of it will be highly excited. There will surely be spin Friday and over the weekend about how Palin has reignited the McCain campaign. Liberals shouldn't dismiss this. Such talk can create a reality, under the right circumstances. </p> <p>But I don't think she connected well enough with swing voters. The CBS News flash poll of uncommitted voters said: Biden 46%, Palin 21%, draw 33%. CNN's similar poll had Biden winning 51-36%. </p> <p>So how did Biden do? Quite well. A little too facts-and-figuresy, as any longtime senator is wont to be. But he was quite good on the kitchen-table stuff. He was clearly superior on foreign policy. He had a couple of good moments of tying Bush around McCain's throat, although he should have done it more often. He displayed very good self-control; he knows \"General McClelland\" in Afghanistan is actually General McKiernan, but he never corrected her. And he actually showed genuine human emotion there for a second, while talking about his family. I mean authentic genuine emotion. I thought that was outlawed in politics.</p> <p>As always with debates, let's see what happens over the next two or three days. If nothing else, the drip, drip, drip of clips of Palin making an idiot of herself to Katie Couric is over, replaced by clips of her performing passably well as a debater. She made herself less of a liability. No greater claim can be made for her than that. </p> <p>Given the way things have been going for John McCain these last few days, I'm sure he'll take that. But make no mistake that this debate was only the second biggest campaign story of the day. The biggest was <a href=\"http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081002/POLITICS01/810020462/1361\">this one</a>. Not even close.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338229953\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Sarah Palin defied the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/02/sarah.palin.election.language\">critics</a> who have been mocking her all week to deliver a punchy, down-to-earth performance in her clash with Joe Biden in the first and only vice-presidential debate of the White House campaign.</p> <p>Although she frequently betrayed nerves, rattling through words and ideas at speed, the Republican vice-presidential candidate dealt with the Wall Street meltdown, climate change, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, Israel and Darfur with more conviction than she demonstrated in recent, disastrous television interviews.</p> <p>She grew in confidence during the 90-minute debate at Washington University, in St Louis, Missouri, and held her own with <a href\"http: www.guardian.co.uk world joebiden\">Biden</a>, who is one of the most knowledgeable politicians in Washington on foreign policy as chairman of the senate foreign affairs committee.</p> <p>In spite of his experience, her folksy, populist tone may have given her the edge with viewers.</p> <p>She began the debate with confidence, striding across the carpet, blowing a kiss to the audience and asking Biden, \"Hey, can I call you Joe?\" She portrayed herself as a White House outsider, an ordinary American mother, and sprinkled her comments with folksy phrases like \"doggone\", \"betcha\" and \"it is about heck of a lot more than that\".</p> <p>Asked who was to blame for the Wall Street crisis, she stuck with the folksy tone: \"Darn right it was the predator lenders.\" She said they had talked Americans into buying houses they could not afford.</p> <p>The debate was more spirited than the one last week between the Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama, and his Republican rival, John McCain. </p> <p>Throughout last night's debate, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/sarahpalin\">Palin</a> tried to connect with viewers, looking directly into the camera when she spoke and talking about their own experiences, in particular over the economic crisis. \"You know, I think a good barometer here, as we try to figure out has this been a good time or a bad time in America's economy is go to a kids' soccer game on Saturday and turn to any parent there on the sideline and ask them, 'How are you feeling about the economy?',\" she said. \"And I'll bet you you're going to hear some fear in that parent's voice.\"</p> <p>Foreign policy provided the biggest flashpoint of the debate. After Biden made a case for early withdrawal from Iraq, Palin hesitated, as if caught off guard, but then made an inflammatory statement: \"Your plan is a white flag of surrender in Iraq.\"</p> <p>She went on to tell Biden that she respected him and his family because, like her, he had a son in Iraq. \"But Barack Obama \u2026 that is another matter,\" she said.</p> <p>Biden remained polite throughout the debate, smiling at her, occasionally bemused, even as she goaded him. \"We're tired of the old politics as usual,\" Palin said. \"And that's why, with all due respect, I do respect your years in the US Senate, but I think Americans are craving something new and different and that new energy and that new commitment that's going to come with reform.\"</p> <p>He remained cool almost all the way through but showed emotion when talking about being a single father, tears coming to his eyes.</p> <p>Although there was a lack of conviction in the way she threw about the names of foreign leaders she only met for the first time last month, she got through the 90 minutes without any serious gaffes. </p> <p>She acknowledged the ridicule and criticism she had suffered over the last week for her stumbling answers in television interviews. At the end of the debate, she implied she had been the victim of a media conspiracy: \"I like being able to answer the tough questions without the filter of the media.\"</p> <p>While the debate was relatively good for Palin, the more important question is whether she can help reverse the downward turn in McCain's campaign that yesterday saw him abandon Michigan, a swing state. But that may be asking too much of her given the continuing uncertainty in Congress and on Wall Street.</p> <p>During the debate, she was happier on energy policy than foreign affairs, even though her views are at odds with McCain. She continued to refuse to concede that climate change is man-made. \"I'm not one to attribute every activity of man to the changes in the climate,\" she said. \"There is something to be said, also, for man's activities, but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet. But there are real changes going on in our climate, and I don't want to argue about the causes.\" </p> <p>Biden shot back: \"I think it's clearly man-made. If you don't understand what the cause is,\" he said, \"it's virtually impossible to come up with a solution.\" </p> <p>Both Palin and Biden devoted most of the debate to talking up their respective presidential candidates. Palin portrayed McCain as a maverick who would shake up Washington while Biden claimed the Republican lacked a grasp of economics, pointing out that a fortnight ago McCain was saying the economy was strong, but two hours later it was in crisis.</p> <p>\"That doesn't make John McCain a bad guy, but it does point out he's out of touch,\" Biden said.</p>",

Only this time something's different. Can you feel it in the atmosphere -- that tingling sensation that absolutely anything could happen tonight, and that what does happen might be quite excruciating and/or of high comedic value? Sarah Palin and Joe Biden have arrived in St Louis, Missouri, for what may well turn out to be the most consequential vice-presidential debate since vice-presidential debates began in 1976, and I'll be liveblogging it here from around <strong>8.45pm eastern time</strong> (<strong>1.45am UK time</strong> \u2014 you can watch the debate live on BBC News Channel, Freeview 080). The debate itself begins at <strong>9pm/2am</strong> and lasts 90 minutes. We'll try to find you some interesting things to say about it all, and we'll bring 'em to ya!</p> <p>Following a week of embarrassing interview clips, and polls that look bad for McCain and <a href=\"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10535499http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10535499\">for Palin specifically,</a> expectations for the Republican running-mate seem so low that she has a serious chance of pulling off a victory of sorts tonight. On the other hand, various Alaskan politicians and others have been busy pointing our that, in the past, Palin has tended to do much better in debates than in other public-speaking contexts. Obama's campaign manager David Plouffe pushed this notion as far as it would go today, <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/plouffe_palin_is_one_of_the_be.php\">drawing gales of laughter from the press corps</a> when he claimed Palin was \"one of the best debaters in American politics.\" But this isn't all one giant Machiavellian game of expectations management. The McCain campaign's nervousness has been too acute and voluminous not to be real, and there's no denying that the stakes tonight for Palin <a href=\"http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/02/whats-at-stake-in-tonights-debate/?ref=opinion\">are enormously high</a>. </p> <p>In recent hours, the McCain campaign has been sounding increasingly optimistic: their hopes seem high that Palin will come into her own, hammering Obama and Biden hard in almost every response she gives, including on the topic of <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14220.html\">Biden's \"foreign policy blunders\"</a> -- which is certainly what you might call audacious, in the circumstances. Biden faces serious challenges of his own: he must avoid his tendency to ramble and to exaggerate; he'll focus his attacks on McCain, and must avoid the merest hint of condescension. Things that Biden should avoid saying tonight include \"why don't you let me answer this one, sweetheart?\" and \"don't you worry your pretty little head about that.\"</p> <p>The <strong>moderator</strong> of tonight's debate is the PBS news broadcaster Gwen Ifill, who'll arrive on a wheelchair after breaking her ankle earlier this week. Ifill has been the <a href=\"http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/zontv/2008/10/debate_moderator_gwen_ifill_at.html\">target of conservative rage</a> this week because of a book she'll be releasing on Inauguration Day about the \"age of Obama.\" (As an even-handed member of the Liberal Media Elite, I'll concede that this doesn't look great, since she'll presumably sell more copies if Obama wins. But of course this hardly means she'll be biased against Palin in her questioning: it's surely more likely that she'll be so acutely aware of that risk that she'll go too far in the other direction.) The <strong>format</strong> is less freeform than last week's presidential debate: Ifill will ask a question, each candidate will have 90 seconds to answer, and then there'll be a follow-up period of just two minutes. This tighter structure came at the request of the Republicans \u2014 in return, they agreed to a Democratic demand to have the candidates debate at lecterns, not seated at a table. </p> <p>Tonight's <strong>drinking game</strong>, which for me will involve <a href=\"http://beerbloggyblog.blogspot.com/2007/02/east-india-pale-ale-by-brooklyn-brewery.html\">Brooklyn Brewery India Pale Ale</a>, is simple. One drink (shot/gulp/whatever) every time Biden refers to his fondness for travelling on Amtrak trains, or to being downed in a helicopter in the mountains of Afghanistan, and one drink when Palin refers to herself as a \"Joe Sixpack American\" or \"regular maverick outsider reformer maverick\". One drink whenever you happen to remember the phrase \"a heartbeat away from the presidency.\" And in the interests of balance: a drink, too, whenever Palin makes a well-argued, semantically intact, logical and lucid argument -- or WASILLA for short. Join me shortly! (Meanwhile, don't forget <a href=\"http://interviewpalin.com/\">Interview Sarah Palin</a>, where you can generate your own random Palin quotes to pass the time...) </p> <p><strong>8.52pm</strong>: (all times eastern): I'm reminded by <a href=\"http://majikthise.typepad.com/majikthise_/2008/10/the-expectation.html\">Majikthise</a> of an expectations-management maneouevre even more comical than Plouffe's \u2014 the 2004 attempt by a Bush campaign strategist to claim that John Kerry was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A34246-2004Sep19.html\">a better debater than Cicero</a>. </p> <p><strong>8.55pm</strong>: OK, Gwen Ifill's on stage now. So far, she hasn't done a twinkly, homespun little introduction like Jim Lehrer did last Friday, asking everybody to turn their mobile phones off.</p> <p><strong>9.00pm</strong>: Here we go. Ifill sets out the format, telling us the questions are all hers, not cleared with either campaign or the debates commission etc. The candidates shake hands, a little awkwardly. \"Nice to meet you!\" Palin says, audibly. \"Can I call you Joe?\" I think he said yes.</p> <p><strong>9.02pm</strong>: A question, first to Biden, on the last few days of the financial crisis. He gallops through a list of Obama policy proposals. Palin's answer: go to \"a kids' soccer game on a Saturday\" and ask them how the soccer moms feel, and \"you betcha\" they'll be afraid. She's looking directly at the camera, which Biden didn't, and answering perfectly coherently, though she probably shouldn't have reminded everyone about John McCain's \"campaign-suspension\" antics of last week, since, well, he didn't really suspend his campaigning. Biden brings it back around to McCain's \"fundamentals are strong\", to which Palin's response seems much less good. She's part of \"team of mavericks\", she explains: time for a drink! \"I do respect your years in the US Senate, but I think Americans are craving something different.\"</p> <p><strong>9.12pm</strong>: A spectacular explosion of populist folksiness from Palin in response a question about who should be blamed for the subprime mortgage crisis. We're less than 10 minutes in and we have soccer moms and now \"Joe Sixpack\": DRINK! Oh dear, I'm going to be intoxicated very soon indeed. Biden repeats his \"John McCain is a good man, but wrong\" line, and brings up McCain's recent article that seemed to call for deregulation of the health industry, following the example of the banking industry. \"I was recently at my local gas station,\" he begins. Biden can play the folksiness game, too.</p> <p><strong>9.15pm</strong>: Palin is sticking <em>hard</em> to her talking points, including a now-notorious (and false) charge about Obama having voted to raise taxes on families -- as opposed to individuals -- earning more than $42,000. Biden comes back strongly, and with his emerging basic attack on Palin, which is that she isn't answering any of the questions. \"I'm still on the tax thing,\" Palin responds -- \"I may not answer the questions the way you or the moderator want to hear, but I'm going to talk to the American people.\" Wow! Biden, who has the best cosmetic dentistry in America, despite having no money, can only grin broadly (condescendingly?) in response. </p> <p><strong>9.20pm</strong>: This tactic of not even really pretending to answer the question might prove to be very clever indeed. Palin's back onto Biden's statement about paying taxes being patriotic. No, Palin says \u2014 \"Patriotic is saying: 'Government, you know, you're not always the solution, sometimes you're the problem.'\" Biden can only grin as she now says (did she really just say this?) that tax breaks don't cost the government money. \"Gwen, I don't know where to start,\" Biden says, and goes on to hammer McCain's healthcare funding proposals, under which, Biden says, 20m people would lose their coverage. \"I call that the ultimate Bridge to Nowhere,\" he says, and looks across at Palin. The audience \u2014 instructed to keep quiet \u2014 laughs loudly.</p> <p><strong>9.24pm</strong>: \"What promises will your campaign not be able to keep because of the bailout?\" Palin spins off into how she broke the power of oil companies in Alaska while Obama supported tax breaks for them, which has nothing to do with the question. She talks about companies and governments like they are little children. \"The oil companies, bless their hearts, are doing what they need to do...\" Ifill picks her up on -- did I mention this? -- totally failing to answer the question.</p> <p><strong>9.28pm</strong>: Now we're arguing about who predicted the subprime mortgage first. Oh no, we're not! \"I just want to talk about energy,\" says Palin, midway through a segment on bankruptcy. Energy independence! Now she's on solid ground. \"Energy independence is the key to this nation's future.\" Ifill picks up the energy theme and moves to climate change: what is true and what is false about the cause of climate change? \"I'm not one to attribute every activity of man to changes in the climate,\" Palin says. And who could argue with that? I made spaghetti bolognese for dinner last night, and I can confirm that it wasn't because of changes in the climate. Biden: \"If you don't understand what the cause is, it's virtually impossible to come up with a solution.\"</p> <p><strong>9.35pm</strong>: \"Drill, baby, drill!\" says Palin -- a drink, I think, even though I didn't specify this one earlier. Palin hits Biden on his opposition to offshore drilling and his earlier remarks about clean coal. Biden is carefully refering to Palin as \"the governor\" and McCain as \"John\", treating Palin with respect and McCain as if he were a dear friend who'd tragically gone off the rails. Which is, perhaps, exactly how Biden sees it.</p> <p><strong>9.37pm</strong>: \"Do you support granting same-sex benefits to couples?\" Biden is unequivocal, and vigorously so: yes. \"Not if it goes closer and closer to redefining the traditional definition of marriage,\" Palin says. But she would be \"tolerant of adults in American choosing their partners.\" So that's all right! But she does want to stress her \"non-support for anything but a traditional definition of marriage.\" </p> <p><strong>9.40pm</strong>: Foreign policy. Here we go. Palin praises the surge in Iraq and repeats what sounds like a well-memorised line about how Biden was right to criticise Obama's position on the surge. \"We cannot afford to lose,\" Palin says, though she offers no plan whatsoever, as Biden points out. CNN's strange live monitoring opinion-o-meter, measuring responses to the debate among uncommitted voters in Ohio, shoots up to its highest level so far when Biden sets out the Obama withdrawal plan, though I suspect the CNN device is a bit meaningless, really. \"Your plan is a white flag of surrender in Iraq,\" Palin says in reply.</p> <p><strong>9.45pm</strong>: Which is more dangerous \u2014 a nuclear Iran or an unstable Pakistan? Neither candidate is going to pick one over the other. Palin hammers away at how Obama might meet with Ahmedinejad. \"That is beyond bad judgment \u2014 that is dangerous.\" Last week at the UN, \"Henry Kissinger shared with me his passion for diplomacy,\" she says, which for some reason I can't quite put my finger on sounds very odd. Perhaps because of Henry Kissinger's passion for carpet-bombing. </p> <p>Biden reminds everyone of John McCain's bizarre Spain gaffe. Bizarre Spain Gaffe might be quite a good name for a short-lived, overintellectual indie band, now I come to think of it.</p> <p><strong>9.52pm</strong>: Israel. Everyone loves Israel! \"I'm so encouraged to know that we both love Israel,\" Palin says, then randomly swerves into accusing Biden of \"too much fingerpointing\" in looking backwards at the Bush administration. Biden looks amused. \"John McCain has been the maverick,\" Palin says. Drink! \"I know, senator Biden, that you respect that, and I respect you for that.\" </p> <p>Palin's decision to criticise Biden for dwelling too much on Bush's mistakes is an open door for Biden, who replies with his strongest passage yet, listing all the ways in which he doesn't see how McCain/Palin would be different to the Bush administration. You know one way in which Palin is <em>exactly</em> like Bush? She says \"nucular\". Also, she smiles strangely. This in itself is not a disqualification from the vice-presidency, I suppose.</p> <p><strong>10.00pm</strong>: When Biden is listing facts, Palin smiles indulgently, as if he were being naughty. \"It's so obvious that I'm a Washington outsider, and I'm not used to how you guys operate,\" she says, in ultra-aw-shucks mode, responding to Biden's comments on why he voted to authorise military action in Iraq. </p> <p><strong>10.07pm</strong>: It's the heartbeat-away-from-a-presidency question. Pretty tough to ask the candidates to speculate on the possibility of their running-mates' deaths; Biden handles it in the most obvious fashion by saying he'd implement Obama's policies -- which enables him to reel off a long list of Obama's policies. The CNN dial-twiddlers love this speech. Palin: \"As for disagreeing with John McCain... what do you expect? A team of mavericks! We're not going to agree on everything.\" She winks at the camera: seriously. If McCain died, Palin would bring \"wisdom from Wasilla Main Street to Washington.\" Sorry, but there's really no distinction at this point between Palin and Tina Fey's impersonation of Palin.</p> <p><strong>10.12pm</strong>: If you want to know what the middle classes are feeling about getting the short end of the economic stick, Biden says, \"come to Home Depot, where I spend a lot of time.\" Doing what? Looking at drill bits, maybe. </p> <p><strong>10.13pm</strong>: Let the record show that Sarah Palin just said \"doggone it\", as part of an excruciating schoolteacherly telling-off of Biden for mentioning the failings of the Bush administration. Then a shoutout to the school where one of her family members teaches. The debate-as-local-radio-phone-in.</p> <p><strong>10.15pm</strong>: In answering a question on the role of the vice-presidency, Palin appears to call for an increase in the power of the vice-presidency. Er \u2014 how about no? She also backs Dick Cheney's radical and controversial view that the vice-presidency is neither part of the executive nor the legislature. She says \"also\" a lot, also.</p> <p><strong>10.18pm</strong>: What is your Achilles heel, Ifill asks the candidates \u2014 first, Sarah Palin, whose perceived weakness is her lack of experience. Palin's answer lands many hundreds of miles from Ifill's question \u2014 she's talking about her strengths, without even paying lip-service to the question. Brilliant, in a mad and appalling way. Biden at least answers the question, though he too turns it into self-aggrandisement. Fair enough \u2014 they're politicians.</p> <p><strong>10.22pm</strong>: Talking of his children and the car accident that killed his wife and daughter, Biden chokes up. (This is extremely popular with CNN's Ohio voters.)</p> <p><strong>10.24pm</strong>: Palin just said \"maverick\" three times, I think, in the space of a few seconds. This is, in itself, maverick. \"Let's talk about the maverick John McCain,\" Biden intervenes, hilariously. \"He's not been a maverick in providing healthcare for people... He's not been a maverick on the war... He's not been a maverick on virtually any of the things people talk about around their kitchen table... Maverick he is not.\"</p> <p><strong>10.26pm</strong>: Final question: \"Can you think of a single policy issue where you were forced to change a long-held view in order to accommodate changed circumstances?\" Biden gives a mildly obscure answer about changing his view about the importance of taking into account the judicial philosophies of court appointees. Palin says she might have \"quasi-caved-in\" by not vetoing budgets in Alaska. \"But on the major principle things, no... we've always seemed to find a way to work together up there in Alaska.\" And now a discussion on how completely excellent bipartisanship is.</p> <p><strong>10.29pm</strong>: Closing statements. \"I like being able to answer these tough questions without the filter of the mainstream media telling people what they've just heard,\" Palin says. Now she's talking about how important it is to keep fighting for freedom. \"There's only one man who has ever fought for you, and that's John McCain.\" Biden: We won't measure change by how much we deregulate and give perks to \"the Exxon Mobils of the world.\" \"My dad used to have an expression, he'd say, champ, when you get knocked down, get up. Well, it's time for America to get up together.\"</p> <p>That's it. The families flood the stage, including Sarah Palin's monumentally large number of children. </p> <p>Well \u2014 no major gaffes on either side. This debate, I suspect, won't be much of a \"game-changer\" in either direction, though of course all polls will prove me decisively wrong over the next 24 hours, as they did last time. Biden gave the far superior debate performance by any objective standard, of course; far superior to pretty much any recent debate I can call to mind. (He largely kept his critical focus on McCain, not Palin, and came off as amply respectful, too -- perhaps even a little admiring of Palin's spiritedness.) But of course all that may not be the relevant point: Palin didn't fall apart, and until discussion moved to foreign policy, at any rate, her relentless strategy of talking only about tax cuts and energy policy, peppering her lines with plenty of folksiness, seemed to serve her well. From the Iraq section onwards, she sometimes seemed to be clinging on by her fingertips. But she did cling on. </p> <p><strong>11pm</strong>: A few final thoughts, having consumed more punditry: might Palin's reference to having been in the job for only about five weeks have been a bad miscalculation? CNN's voter focus group seemed to think so. Palin meant it as a boast, of course -- but there's outsiderhood, and then there's outsiderhood. Also (to use Palin's favourite word), also: how wise was it to attack Biden for focusing on the Bush administration's errors, rather than putting distance between McCain/Palin and Bush? ...And how much will it matter who looked the more \"presidential\", given that this isn't a presidential debate? If it does matter, again, Biden will win without question. But I can't help thinking there's a conservative Republican base that's feeling fairly happy tonight, if only due to relief.
