  "<blockquote> <p>Basta Ya! Unidos Por El Cambio!<br>(Enough! Unite For Change!) </p> </blockquote> <p>I am sitting under this sign and a massive American flag in the Obama campaign office in Coral Gables, Miami. I have just flown in from New York to volunteer for Obama in Florida till election day.</p> <p>At this stage all activity is concentrated on GOTV: Getting Out The Vote. This translates into hours spent driving from house to house making sure that those who say they will vote for Obama actually do. Early voting is <a href=\"http://www.miami4obama.com/2008/10/28/early-voting-hours-extended/\">already underway</a> in Miami with long waiting times.</p> <p>Early voting counts from ballots already cast at the polls and through the mail are favouring Obama with a 166,311-vote lead. But there is still a lot of work to be done. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/01/battleground.polls/\">Some polls</a> are giving Obama a four-point lead while others are predicting that it is <a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x2882.xml?ReleaseID=1224\">too close to call</a>. Both Florida and Miami Dade county, in which this office is located, are up for grabs. As the election nears, anti-Obama groups are getting more vocal.</p> <p>This morning I arrived at the campaign office to catch a noisy protest by anti-abortion Cuban Catholics. Ten women holding graphic pictures of fetuses with the words \"Voting for Obama is Voting for Dead Babies\". And one man looking rather dapper in a grey suit thumbing a rosary with one hand and holding up a sign with the other: \"Ch\u00e1vez. Lula. Ortega. Castro. The Community party USA: All Are Backing Obama. Want To Join Them?\" The sign and the rosary make good TV. And sure enough, a TV camera crew has shown up.</p> <p>But is this what the majority of the Cuban community thinks? It is hard to tell. I head down to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Havana\">Little Havana</a> to take a stroll down Calle Ocho, its main drag. It's a gateway to a very different Miami to that of the much-photographed South Beach glitz and glamour: lots of 99 cents shops and old men strolling or playing dominoes, the smell of cigars drifting around corners, salsa and merengue blaring out of rundown cafes.</p> <p>McCain-Palin signs are stapled onto palm trees and being held up by a women standing at an intersection. I go into a cigar place to try and guage the atmosphere. There are rows and rows of cigars from Nicaragua, Honduras, Dominica, plus the ones hand-rolled in the factory around the block. The conversation with the shop owner doesn't get very far. She supports Obama but as I don't speak enough Spanish to ask why, and she doesn't speak English, it has to end there.</p> <p>Next stop, a Cuban Creole restaurant: same story there. I do notice that everything on the menu is Cuban with the exception of one item which is decidedly American \u2013 <em>racion de papas fritas</em>: freedom fries. Perhaps that says enough.</p> <p>Back at the campaign office, a staffer tells me that this year has seen a significant jump in Cuban Democrats in Miami. This in addition to the high black turnout that is expected might balance out the people worried about Communism and abortion. That in addition to the few Creole speakers I met sporting Obama signs saying \"Chanjman: Nou Bezwen\" (Change We Can Believe In).</p> <p>It is now 10.30pm and someone is playing salsa on their laptop and another guy is singing along as he ploughs through his data entry tasks for the evening. \"I have faith in Americans, I really do. The majority of them anyway,\" I hear a volunteer say, to no one in particular. Fingers crossed her faith will be rewarded.</p>",

  "<p>Republican recriminations have begun in earnest. Looking forward to senator John McCain's <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/30/campaign.wrap/index.html\">near certain defeat</a> in the US presidential elections, opposing factions of the GOP are busy crafting narratives to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/struggle-for-soul-of-republican-party-degenerates-into-civil-war-975446.html\">explain the loss</a> that pin the blame squarely on those other ne'er-do-wells in the party.</p> <p>\"If you believe in miracles, you still believe in McCain,\" <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hW-_0dHk_7_Wfu1KXwcoDeviWGYQD9443C180\">said</a> Republican consultant Joe Gaylord. The AP correctly characterised him as only one member of a \"mounting chorus of Republicans predicting their nominee's demise\". That chorus is mounting because, less than a week out, McCain trails in polls in several must-win states.</p> <p>Quite a few explanations for this impending electoral Armageddon are at least plausible. President George Bush is currently <a href=\"http://pollster.com/polls/us/jobapproval-bush.php\">less popular</a> than a bad hangover, which makes him a truly tough act for any Republican to follow. Nobody wins them all and the economy has gone sour at a particularly bad time for the party in the White House.</p> <p>But all of the explanations for an Obama administration without a villain or a goat in them rather miss the point. Republicans are looking for <a href=\"http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5hg8V3MjnVJnmXtQoqtt4voh3e9Jw\">someone to blame</a> for their unpopularity. And it would be much easier if that person's mistakes and shortcomings reaffirmed their preconceived notions of how the world works.</p> <p>Smart operators are getting an early start because they know competing narratives about the loss will help determine the future of the party. Those narratives are 1) \"Sarah Palin lost it for us\" or b) \"McCain's bailout theatrics lost it for us\". The contest now is to make one of those stories stick.</p> <p>The Blame Palin faction has a head start. She is <a href=\"http://newsminer.com/news/2008/oct/30/palin-sees-dip-popularity-alaska-rest-nation/\">roundly hated</a> by the more moderate-liberal wing of the party. They are less numerous but well connected and overrepresented among journalists and pundits.</p> <p>Pro-war left libertarian author <a href=\"http://www.ryansager.com/blog/\">Ryan Sager</a> wrote that the pick \"complete[d] the transformation of the GOP into a southern-centered party based on social division and cultural resentment\". In a widely publicised interview, New York Times columnist David Brooks said that Palin represented a \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvxQwNqZSOQ\">fatal cancer</a> to the Republican Party\" because she comes from a \"populist tradition\" of conservatism that not only \"scorn[s] liberal ideas but \u2026 scorn[s] ideas entirely\".</p> <p>The story that anti-Palinites tell is one of honor and decency wasted. With his record of military service, bipartisanship and thinking outside the box, McCain could have appealed to most voters of intelligence and goodwill. Then he picked the untested Alaska governor in a naked grab for votes, and it backfired. It caused many undecided voters to think of McCain not as a stand-up guy but as an crass opportunist given to the worst sort of pandering, and thus rejected him.</p> <p>The only problem with this story is what it leaves out. On the eve of the Palin nomination, McCain was dead in the political water. Conservatives didn't like him. He was too old and too rigid. Barack Obama had just delivered a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ato7BtisXzE\">convention speech</a> in a sports arena that shattered previous records of television viewership for convention speeches.</p> <p>Then McCain picked the little-known northernmost governor to be his running mate and bought himself a fighting chance. There was a real possibility that many grassroots conservatives would bolt and vote for Libertarian candidate <a href=\"http://www.bobbarr2008.com/splash/?s0820\">Bob Barr</a>. Palin brought them back into the fold while generating intense media interest. A week after Obama delivered his record breaking speech, McCain topped it.</p> <p>It looked for a brief moment like Palin had given McCain the edge. So it is not at all surprising that many conservatives are reacting badly to criticism of the Alaska governor. Former White House aide Jim Nuzzo told the Sunday Telegraph that following the election \"A lot of people are going to be <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/29/palin.gop/index.html\">excommunicated</a>. David Brooks and [fellow anti-Palinites] David Frum and Peggy Noonan are dead people in the Republican Party\".</p> <p>Then there's the bizarre bail-out behaviour explanation. The Arizona senator announced that he was suspending his campaign to return to DC to deal with the serious problem of crafting a government bail-out, and thus would be skipping the first presidential debate. Instead, he put in a few more media appearances, returned to DC and almost derailed bail-out talks, then took part in the first debate anyway. He insisted that the fundamentals of the American economy were \"sound,\" railed against Wall Street and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13573.html\">called for the replacement</a> of the current head of the SEC with New York Democratic Attorney General <a href=\"http://www.oag.state.ny.us/\">Andrew Cuomo</a>.</p> <p>Conservative House Republicans worked to vote down the first bail-out bill. McCain never showed any interest in opposing it. He <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/02/john-mccain-gets-incohere_n_131241.html\">went along</a> with the Senate bill, which was loaded down with the sort of ridiculous pork projects that he regularly rails against, and he even <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/dividends-income/2008/10/13/dissecting-mccains-bailout-plan.aspx\">proposed to enlarge the scope of the bail-out</a> by using the government to restructure mortgages for homeowners who felt they'd got a bad deal. Most voters likely found this weird. Conservatives found it depressing. It reaffirmed every doubt they'd ever had about McCain's vision of the economy and, according to their favoured story, only hastened his defeat.</p> <p>They're right that McCain had made gains running as a born again conservative and faltered during the bail-out, but there's an awful lot of static in the polling. The stock market tanked and the nation was treated to dour economic forecasts. McCain might have opposed the bail-out but taken a beating anyway. We'll never know for sure, though it would have been nice for Americans to have had a clear cut choice on this important issue.</p> <p>In the Republican recriminations, shots at Palin traded with shots at the man who chose to put her on the ticket, we are seeing the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0612.dougherty.html\">Dougherty Doctrine</a> in all its ugly glory. As the wag wrote, \"If it were more like me, the Republican Party would be better off. It's failing because it's like you\".</p>",
  "<p>In the waning days of the election, the McCain campaign has realised that its attempts to tie Barack Obama to \"unrepentant domestic terrorist\" Bill Ayers aren't having much effect. So it's trying a new tactic, blasting the candidate for consorting with unrepentant domestic Palestinian <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/nyregion/31khalil.html?bl&amp;ex=1225598400&amp;en=e57c35561d503060&amp;ei=5087%0A\">Rashid Khalidi</a>. Now an <a href=\"http://www.sipa.columbia.edu/mei/khalidi.shtml\">eminent professor</a> of Arab studies at Columbia, Khalidi, like Obama, formerly taught at the University of Chicago, where the two men were friends. Hoping to instill shadowy associations between Obama and Arabs in the minds of low-information voters, the McCain team has taken to slandering a thoughtful and respectable man.<br> The McCain team is now <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/middleeast/la-na-video30-2008oct30,0,7519467.story\">demanding</a> that the Los Angeles Times release a tape of Obama's appearance at a 2003 going-away party for Khalidi. The Times is refusing to do so because, when it was given the video, it agreed not to share it. Playing the aggrieved victim, McCain <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i2cTbnZTDVHPcifBpEzmkfqOOtlg\">said in a radio interview</a>: \"If there was a tape of John McCain in a neo-Nazi outfit, I think the treatment of the issue would be slightly different.\" Appearing on CNN yesterday, McCain flack Michael Goldfarb claimed: \"Barack Obama has a long track record of being around anti-Semitic, anti-Israel and anti-American rhetoric.\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCaOCWYpPk4\">Attempting to challenge Goldfarb</a>, CNN host Rick Sanchez said: \"Can you name one other person besides Khalidi who he hangs around with who is anti-Semitic?\" Goldfarb couldn't, but the damage had been done \u2013 not to Obama, but to Khalidi, whose anti-Semitism had been presented as a matter of accepted fact. <br> I don't know Khalidi personally, though I've interviewed him on a number of occasions and have read his recent book, <a href=\"http://www.logosjournal.com/golub.htm\">Resurrecting Empire</a>. I know, however, that there is nothing in his record to justify smearing him as a bigot. While the McCain campaign has presented him as a \"PLO spokesman\" \u2013 and it wouldn't be a crime if he were \u2013 in fact, Khalidi was simply an outside adviser to the Palestinian delegation at negotiations convened by the Republican secretary of state James Baker during the first Bush administration. Apparently, McCain is now so hostile to diplomacy that participating in American-sponsored talks is deemed anti-American. <br> To be sure, Khalidi is a supporter of Palestinian rights and a serious critic of Israel and of American policy in the Middle East, one who is well to the left of Obama. But he condemns violence, criticised Yasser Arafat's corruption and cronyism and has consistently acknowledged Jewish suffering. Fair-minded friends of Israel have praised his writing. New York Times columnist <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/thomaslfriedman/index.html\">Thomas Friedman</a>, certainly not a notorious Jew-hater, described Under Siege, Khalidi's book about PLO decision-making during the 1982 Lebanon war, as \"extremely valuable\" and \"generally objective, lucid and incisive\". Professor Khalidi is on the board of sponsors of the <a href=\"http://www.pij.org/index.php\">Palestine-Israel Journal</a>, a publication founded by prominent Palestinian and Israeli journalists to encourage dialogue between the two sides. The board also includes famed Israeli writer <a href=\"http://kirjasto.sci.fi/dgross.htm\">David Grossman</a>. By the degraded standards of the McCain-Palin campaign, Grossman could also be defamed as an enemy of the Jews. Indeed, so could McCain himself. As has now been widely reported, under McCain's leadership, the International Republican Institute <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2008/10/john_mccains_trick_or_treat.html?hpid=topnews\">gave nearly half a million dollars</a> to a Palestinian research centre Khalidi co-founded. <br> The McCain campaign's attacks on Khalidi are categorically different than its attacks on Ayers. Those were unfair to Obama, who was not, by all accounts, particularly close to the man, and who never gave a hint of condoning his youthful violence. Ayers, however, has indeed done shameful things, so his public excoriation was not entirely undeserved. That's not true of Khalidi. He is guilty of nothing. The dangerous implications of McCain's assaults on him stretch beyond this election, suggesting that friendship with prominent Arabs is grounds for suspicion, and thus dangerous for ambitious politicians. (That is, unless the Arabs in question belong to the Saudi royal family).  Given that our leaders' failure to even try and understand Arab grievances has contributed to catastrophic foreign policy blunders, Obama's engagement with a prominent, moderate Palestinian intellectual should, in any rational society, be seen as a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-obamamideast10apr10,0,3627849.story\">point in his favour</a>. By trying to turn their acquaintance into evidence of subversion, McCain does more than further disgrace himself. His reckless rhetoric threatens to push legitimate criticism of Israeli and American policy even further outside the bounds of acceptable political discussion, making straight talk on the Middle East ever more elusive.</p>",
  "<p>Politics in the morning paper is nothing new in America - but days before the election, ideologically charged content being packaged with newspapers is sparking a heated debate over advertising standards. <br> Subscribers to the Cincinnati Enquirer, in the swing state of Ohio, today joined readers in Cleveland and Las Vegas as the latest to get a free add-on with their newspaper: a DVD of an anti-Barack Obama film. The Democrat's supporters, predictably, were displeased.</p> <p>One newspaper subscriber in Cleveland accused John McCain of funding the DVD advert. \"I think it's very sleazy,\" Marilyn Garfunkel told the local Fox TV network. \"I think it does not bode well for them in terms of how they've approached the campaign up to this point.\"</p> <p>But the free film, titled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/05/uselections2008.barackobama2\">Hype: The Obama Effect</a>, was unconnected to the McCain camp. A conservative activist group, Citizens United, is spending more than $1m to distribute 1.25m copies of the Hype DVDs in three election-year battleground states.</p> <p>The 95-minute film features several attacks on Obama that have been discredited by independent fact-checkers, including a claim that he would raise taxes on most US small businesses. Jerome Corsi, the author of a controversial book criticising Obama, also appears in the film.</p> <p>Another free advertising DVD, however, has elicited a bigger backlash in this highly contentious election year. A non-profit group called the Clarion Fund has paid for 28m newspaper readers in swing states to receive free copies of Obsession, a film that has drawn criticism from religion scholars for its comparison of radical Islam to Nazism. </p> <p>Obsession uses stark imagery to create a frightening picture of violence-seeking Muslim extremists. Although the film includes no overtly election-related content, the Clarion's website contained language praising John McCain before later being removed.</p> <p>As Obsession DVDs appeared on the front steps of news subscribers across the US, a wave of protest developed in response. About 75 readers marched in front of the Oregonian newspaper's offices in Portland, where the mayor had advised against promoting the film.</p> <p>The News &amp; Observer in Raleigh, North Carolina, drew attention to the DVD advert with an accompanying article and was met with a torrent of response that leaned towards angry criticism of the film. About 50 readers cancelled their subscriptions to the newspaper, according to the Associated Press.</p> <p>\"I do not appreciate this right-wing propaganda being put in this battleground state's newspaper. I find that appalling,\" one commenter on the News &amp; Observer website wrote.</p> <p>Another offered sarcastic hope that the newspaper \"made a small fortune in distributing this abomination to your subscribers because, in all other ways, your newspaper is totally and irreversibly bankrupt\".</p> <p>Kelly McBride, leader of the ethics faculty at the Poynter Institute of Journalism in Florida, said that the anticipated reader frustration was not reason enough for newspapers to decline the Obsession advert.</p> <p>\"As long as it's clearly labelled as advertising, then I don't think you have grounds to reject it,\" McBride said. \"I don't think you can create a different standard for political adverts than other adverts \u2026 The standard is, if you can pay, and it's legal and not grossly offensive to the community, then we'll take it.\"</p> <p>The timing of the Obsession mailings, during a hotly contested election as Republicans criticise Obama for pursuing talks with Iran, has raised questions about whether the DVDs were intended to help McCain. The Republican Jewish Coalition, which has endorsed McCain, also has distributed free copies of the film to its members.</p> <p>Newspapers in Cleveland, Detroit, St Louis, and Greensboro, North Carolina, were among the few that declined to run the Obsession DVD.</p> <p>\"Clarion was thinking of more creative ways to use newspapers than newspapers were,\" Seth Hettena, a reporter who investigated the film for the Columbia Journalism Review, said. </p> <p>Hettena described the free DVDs as \"fall[ing] into a grey area, at the very least\". He cited the timing of the newspaper adverts, their distribution to 14 US states where voters are split on the presidential race, and Clarion's ability to keep its donors secret under the tax laws.</p> <p>The two films have generated fresh scrutiny of media advertising standards, but DVD inserts are not the only paid content being questioned by readers and journalists alike. Two newspapers in Virginia this week rejected a bid by the National Rifle Association to package their daily editions in plastic bags with the potent message, \"Vote for Freedom \u2026 Defeat Obama\".</p>",
  "<p>We're in the last few days before the election, and we're already getting a sense of what is working and not working for the candidates. The big question at this late hour is whether John McCain can find a message that will persuade undecided voters to break his way in large enough numbers to win. </p> <p>Part of this post is motived by a question from <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/group.php?gid=27070229703\">our election Facebook group</a>. Many people are asking if the Obama half-hour infomercial worked. Mike Mullane asked:</p> <blockquote> <p>How many people watched the whole half hour? Did any of the papers run instant polls? What was your gut feeling about the Obama ad - was it a mistake? What are the bloggers saying?</p> </blockquote> <p>Nielsen Media Research which provides the ratings doesn't say whether people watched the entire half hour, but we do know that the Obama-mercial was <a href=\"http://features.csmonitor.com/politics/2008/10/30/obamas-prime-time-address-335-million-people-like-commercials/\">more popular than some of the regular programming on broadcast networks</a> at the same time. On NBC, that might be down to the new Knight Rider being such a complete waste of time. But 33.5m people, <a href=\"http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/media_entertainment/217-of-households-in-top-local-tv-markets-watched-obama-infomercial/\">more than 20% in most major TV markets</a>, watched all or part of the infomerical, which is about half the number who watched the debates.</p> <p>By and large, the <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/usnews/politics/bulletin/bulletin_081030.htm\">media gushed about it</a>. <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2008/10/obama-infomerci.html\">ABC's George Stephanopoulos said it was \"worth every penny\"</a>, which was about the most negative thing he said about it.</p> <p>I've yet to find a newspaper that ran a snap poll on it. It would be expensive, an expense that most US newspapers can't afford right now, to run a snap poll just looking at an ad, even one at that length. And half-hour ads are not unprecedented in American politics. Billionaire Ross Perot ran 15 infomercials in 1992.</p> <p>That leaves us to ask whether we're seeing any polls nationally or on the state level show a shift one way or another that might indicate an impact. Some 36 hours later, nationally, apart from a <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/todays-polls-1030.html\">few outliers that show the race tightening quite dramatically</a>, there hasn't been much <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE49J0LF20081031\">movement in the polls for weeks</a>. On the state level, there is a little movement, and <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/mccains-mountain-of-problem.html\">most of it is not in the direction that benefits John McCain</a>. I'll take a closer look at some of the polls later in the day. They are coming so quickly right now that it takes some effort to find the signal in the noise. I tend to discount national polls at this point and focus on the state polls.</p> <p>Also one thing to watch in these polls is whether they rely on a voter turnout model from four years ago or are based on \"intention to vote\". Larry Sabato thinks we're going to <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/article.php?id=LJS2008102301\">break the 1960 \"modern high water mark for voter turnout</a>\" with more than 60% of potential voters going to the polls.</p> <p>My gut feeling is that as long as it didn't knock off the air the favourite show of a lot of undecided voters, the impact will be negligible. I doubt it persuaded many people who hadn't already made up their minds. The two potential returns on Obama's $4m investement are making sure that his supporters <a href=\"http://blackpoliticsontheweb.com/2008/10/31/wary-of-voter-overconfidence-obama-not-letting-up/\">don't get complacent and fail to vote</a> and that it displaced coverage of McCain for another 24-hour news cycle.</p> <p>What are bloggers saying? From the great state of Alaska, the <a href=\"http://www.ownthesidewalk.com/2008/10/vote-early-often.html\">blogger behind Own the Sidewalk reports:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>After I voted, I stopped by my bank and mentioned to the teller that I'd just voted. So had she. She told me she's been a Republican all her life but just couldn't bring herself to vote for McCain and Palin. After watching the \"infomercial,\" she and her husband had decided to vote for Obama.</p> </blockquote> <p>One voter does not a wave make, but the number of Republicans who I've met who are voting for Obama this year, sometimes voting for a Democrat for the first time in their lives, shows that this isn't an isolated case.</p> <p>Conservative blogger Ed Morrissey dismissed the <a href=\"http://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/31/obamamercial-a-flop-with-critics-ratings/\">half-hour infomercial as a flop</a>. He does make a good point. The 21.7% figure is combined across five networks, but seeing as it was beating the regular programming on the broadcast networks adds counter-balancing context to that figure.</p> <p>As I said, the infomercial won't have changed minds, especially in the US political blogosphere where people tend not to sit on the fence. The infomercial should be seen in the context of Obama'a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powell_Doctrine\">Powell doctrine campaign</a> of totally overwhelming McCain on every level. Obama is drowning out McCain on the air. Obama and his army of paid and volunteer staff dwarf even the vaunted 72-hour GOTV (get out the vote) effort that George Bush orchestrated in 2000 and 2004. Obama is forcing McCain to make tough choices, including <a href=\"http://themoderatevoice.com/politics/republican-party/23920/mccains-financial-resources-choice-tv-campaign-ads-over-ground-game/\">pulling money out of GOTV efforts to counter Obama's advantage in advertising</a>.</p> <p><strong>Joe the Plumber argument not working</strong></p> <p>While the informercial was an expensive (albeit affordable for Team Obama) wash, McCain's \"Joe the Plumber\" tax argument doesn't seem to be winning over undecided voters. <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/blogs/why_the_joe_the_plumber_tax_de.php\">Brian Schaffner at Pollster.com looks at the numbers</a> and explains why. John McCain is treading on 'dangerous ground when he criticises Obama for wanting to raise taxes on wealthier Americans, and Brian says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Another problem with using \"Joe the Plumber\" to criticize the redistribution of wealth is that this argument doesn't seem to have any particular appeal for the demographic \"Joe the Plumber\" is supposed to represent--working class whites.</p> </blockquote> <p>John McCain is facing a tough fight to the close. He's having to make difficult decisions with limited resources. Barack Obama's decision not to accept public campaign financing, which would have put his campaign on par financially with John McCain, might have been a broken promise, but it's allowed the Obama to completely overwhelm McCain on almost every level. Public financing of presidential campaigns will have to be overhauled to remain relevant after this election. </p> <p>Thanks for the question Mike. Keep them coming. If you've got a question, leave them in the comments. I'll try to answer as many as possible in the closing days of this election.</p>",
  "<p>There is a lot of talk about talk with the Taliban in the air. From Washington, London, Peshawar, Kabul, Islamabad and Mecca over the past three weeks we have had news <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601082&amp;sid=aUhZCf2aqF6w&amp;refer=canada\">reports</a> on \"contacts\" between Taliban, Afghan, Pakistani and US representatives about a negotiated solution for the fighting in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Most sources agree that these amount to little more than \"putting out feelers\", \"testing the water\", and \"making contacts\". In diplomatic-speak this activity appears have the urgency for which the Spanish concept of ma\u00f1ana would be an exaggeration.</p> <p>For what are the talks aimed at, what kind of Afghanistan do they hope to achieve and in what time-frame? And where's the plan, the strategy, to get this?</p> <p>This appears to have been the message at a forum convened at the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/washington/31policy.html?ref=us\">Army and Navy Club</a> close to the White House two weeks ago \u2013 details of which have just emerged this morning in the New York Times. Delegates included Kai Eide, the UN Special representative in Kabul, and the former US commander in Afghanistan, General Karl Eikenberry. For two days they briefed security advisers to Barak Obama and John McCain.</p> <p>Their message was blunt: whoever is sworn in as the next president on January 20 next must have a clear plan for Afghanistan will be too late as security through key parts of the country continues to \"spiral down\".</p> <p>The new American Central Command chief, <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jIqM8xB-dQ00_EEBzbY5b56fVapg\">General David Petraeus</a>, has proposed a surge of a further 20,000 American troops, hoping that will fix security in Afghanistan as he says his surge of 35,000 extra forces did in Iraq last year.</p> <p>But Afghanistan is a whole different tactical ball game from Iraq, from terrain to enemy strengths and tactics and the abilities of the host government forces. The famous Petraeus surge trick may not work twice. </p> <p>On Tuesday this week the Foreign Secretary David Miliband and the new Defence Secretary John Hutton, flanked by advisers, discussed Iraq and Afghanistan before the combined defence and foreign affairs committees of the House of Commons for some two and a half hours. </p> <p>The testimony was precise and detailed, but in the end amounted to little more than wondering out loud.</p> <p>They speculated about the outcomes of the three elections next year in both countries. They wondered what the shape of future governance in Kabul might be. They pondered how to tackle the narco-crime-terrorist economy. There were dark mutterings about Pakistan. This included a wonderful bit of wishful thinking about \"getting the Pakistan army to concentrate on the battle for Afghanistan, and not their preoccupation with India\". One wonders what particular planet the policy advisers at the FCO and MoD were on when they came up with that line.</p> <p>The day after, Wednesday, the MoD announced an emergency \u00a3700m package to buy a range of 700 new vehicles designed to resist the new generation of mines and remotely triggered bombs being used by the Taliban. These include mine removers, armoured diggers, recce vehicles, personnel and ammunition carriers. The Americans are placing a similar order with Oshkosh and Force Protection for mine-resistant vehicles.</p> <p>The sense of strategy for both Iraq and Afghanistan is in danger of being lost in an ocean of tactical ideas and initiatives. To say we are going to stick it out, and hope to grind down the Taliban over the next 10 years is not a realistic strategic goal. After all, look at what has been achieved by the internationals in Afghanistan in the seven years since November 2001. (While there have been some gains socially, in health and education, security and the narco-economy must be put in the loss columns of the ledger).</p> <p>This week Henry Kissinger offered some pithy thoughts about the Vietnam saga, which should provide food for thought for the new US president. Critiquing the reflections of McGeorge Bundy, Kennedy's National Security Adviser, prepared by his researcher, and now critic, Gordon M Goldstein, Kissinger gave these thoughts: \"The purpose of war is victory. Stalemate is ... not a desirable strategic objective. Victory needs to be defined as an outcome achievable in a timeframe sustainable by American public opinion.\"</p> <p>All very well to have such 20-20 hindsight now, you may argue. However, Kissinger's warning about time in such conflicts is \u2013 pardon the pun \u2013 timely for what is now happening in Iraq and Afghanistan. Time is running out for the US and its allies in both countries \u2013 as the status of forces wrangle is proving in Iraq. You cannot talk about \"generational wars\" and \"open-ended commitments\" to seeing it through. You cannot say your forces can be squatters in these lands, when international law and diplomacy, and lore of the insurgents, does not recognise international squatters' rights.</p>",
  "<p>Few people have been more persona non grata than George Bush during this election season. Republican candidates have gone out of their way to avoid being seen with the president. In fact, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14799.html\">Bush has raised $40m less</a> for the Republican party and its candidates in the 2008 election than he did last cycle. However, John McCain is becoming equally as toxic. He is, in fact, becoming the next George Bush.</p> <p>In recent months, McCain has made a particular effort to separate himself from the president and shrug off the liberal talking point that his policies would represent Bush's third term. In September, McCain campaign chief Rick Davis gave Bloomberg News an <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=amLe498jVevw&amp;refer=worldwide\">\"emphatic no\"</a> when asked whether the two men would be campaigning together this fall, saying that they had \"turned that page\". (This attitude is a far cry from <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/02/18/mccain-bush-term/\">what McCain said about Bush</a> last February: \"I'd be honoured to be anywhere with him under any circumstances.\")</p> <p>Nevertheless, even solid Republicans are now equating McCain with Bush. Norm Coleman, facing a tough Senate re-election race in Minnesota, <a href=\"http://www.madison.com/tct/news/stories/311273\">never mentioned McCain</a> at multiple campaign stops. Last month, an aide to Coleman <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/10/06/coleman-mccain-health-care/\">refused to back McCain's healthcare plan</a>, curiously saying only that Coleman was <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/10/06/coleman-mccain-health-care/\">\"aligned with senator Coleman's plan\"</a>. He also called for the McCain campaign to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/22/another-gop-senator-decri_n_136949.html\">stop its negative robocalls</a>. </p> <p>At least two other Republicans, Gordon Smith of Oregon and Susan Collins of Maine, also broke rank and joined the anti-robocall chorus. Smith has gone even further, grabbing hold of Barack Obama's coattails and going out of his way to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/15/us/politics/15oregon.html\">praise the Democratic candidate</a>. </p> <p>Republican senatorial committee chairman John Ensign of Nevada recently told MSNBC that there was \"no question the top of the ticket is affecting our Senate races, and it's making it a lot more difficult.\" Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, in a tight re-election race in Kentucky, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/15071_Page2.html\">hasn't done any events with McCain</a> since a fundraiser last spring. </p> <p>Few Republicans have come out excited by the direction McCain is taking the party. In fact, the Republican National Committee's website currently has no mentions of McCain on its front page. Obama's name, however, appears five times. The top landing graphic links to a speech by former senator Fred Thompson. (The graphic does eventually change to a McCain promotion, but you have to wait around more than 10 seconds.)</p> <p>Many conservatives already view their presidential candidate as a lame duck. According to Politico's Jonathan Martin, a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/1008/Conservatives_plan_secret_postelection_strategy_session.html?showall\">\"who's who of conservative leaders\"</a> is planning a major strategy session for November 6 to chart out the movement's future. Republicans are publicly criticising McCain and his campaign with increasing frequency. While some have decried his Karl Rove-like tactics, those voices have mostly come from the old guard, such as representative <a href=\"http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/connecticut/ny-bc-ct--mccain-shays1029oct29,0,7578166.story\">Chris Shays</a> of Connecticut and Colin Powell. More are urging McCain to be more aggressive in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/01/uselections2008.johnmccain\">fighting for conservative causes</a>. </p> <p>The one person on the McCain campaign who has generated excitement is Sarah Palin, who seems to already be gearing up for a 2012 run. She has been more than willing to hit Obama for \"palling around with terrorists\" and attack his \"socialist\" policy proposals. In her energy policy speech this week, Palin repeatedly veered away from her prepared remarks by substituting <a href=\"http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/10/29/palin-big-oil-love/\">\"our administration\"</a> for every reference to the \"McCain administration\". </p> <p>Former House speaker and conservative revolution leader Newt Gingrich retired from Congress in 1999, but he certainly hasn't gone away quietly. In fact, he's shaping up to be a mover in the next conservative shake-up. A constant presence on Fox News, Gingrich has been a thorn in McCain's side. Gingrich has also been moulding the next generation of Republican foot soldiers in Congress, allegedly whipping up last-minute <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/09/30/gingrich-against-bailout/\">opposition to the financial bail-out package</a> last month. (Gingrich has denied this involvement.) Additionally, Gingrich has invested considerable resources into an energy campaign urging: <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/08/06/gingrich-aswf/\">\"Drill Here. Drill Now. Pay Less.\"</a> He even appeared as a <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/news/stories/2008/08/05/gingrich_oil_protest.html\">\"guest star\"</a> in the GOP energy protest over the summer, which conservatives considered <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/08/04/gop-tea-party-energy/\">\"America's greatest hour\"</a>.</p> <p>Congressmen such as Jeb Hensarling of Texas, Mike Pence of Indiana and Thaddeus McCotter of Michigan are typical of Gingrich's foot soldiers. They are intent on moving away from Bush, who decimated the Republican party, and McCain, who isn't ideological enough on issues such as immigration. The New Republic's <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/03/AR2008100302401.html\">Eve Fairbanks</a> described this new guard as \"fiercely stubborn, gutsily insubordinate, drama-loving and \u2026 unadulteratedly ideological.\"</p> <p>A new direction doesn't necessarily mean success. Just as both Gingrich's Contract with America and Tom DeLay's infamous 1994 Republican revolution eventually failed, this new conservative direction may also find itself unable to live up to its own standards. One thing seems certain, however: Neither McCain nor Bush will be leading the way.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's team demonstrated its confidence of victory by today announcing it is to extend its campaign in the final days deep into the Republican heartland, adding to its target list even John McCain's home state Arizona.</p> <p>While publicly warning against complacency, Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, told reporters today he was \"thrilled\" by the level of support for the Democratic candidate among the millions of ballots already cast in early voting.</p> <p>\"The die is being cast as we speak,\" said Plouffe. \"We think we have built up an advantage in all the states so that Senator McCain on election day is not just going to have to carry the day, but carry it convincingly.\"</p> <p>But McCain's camp, in defiance of Obama's poll leads and a US media that has all but written him off, claimed he was on the verge of springing a surprise result.</p> <p>\"We're pretty jazzed up about what were seeing, and the movement in this election,\" his campaign manager, Rick Davis, told a reporters' conference call. \"We are witnessing, I believe, one of the greatest comebacks since John McCain won the primary.\"</p> <p>With strong Democratic turnout in early voting, Obama's team now expects to hold all the states that John Kerry won in 2004 and add Republican states from Colorado to Virginia.</p> <p>It is to advertise for the first time in Arizona and put fresh resources into Georgia and North Dakota - states that were once seen as longshots.</p> <p>The decision to target Arizona may be designed to try to spook McCain who has not campaigned in his home state, assuming it was solid.</p> <p>In spite of Obama's show of strength, polls indicate that Florida, one of the big states that has decided past elections, remains too close to call.</p> <p>Plouffe described the campaign as building to a crescendo this weekend, with a \"ferocious\" effort by both sides to get their voters to the polls.</p> <p>Campaign officials said later they had 1.4m volunteers operating<br>from 770 offices.</p> <p>Hopes of taking a southern state like Georgia which for so long has been a no-go area for Democrats, have been raised by early voting figures and the strength of the campaign team in the state. Plouffe said the Obama camp had had 4,800 district organisers in place since the summer aimed at getting the vote out.</p> <p>Obama was set to take a break from campaigning last night to take his daughters out for Halloween, but he is scheduled to visit eight states in a final burst of campaigning before election day.</p> <p>The Democrats brought Al Gore into the mix for the last lap before election day. Gore today made an emotional return to Florida, the state where his hopes for the White House evaporated in the 2000 elections.</p> <p>The McCain camp, meanwhile, is diverting resources from organisation to a last-minute advertising blitz to persuade the remaining undecided voters.</p> <p>Mike DuHaime, a McCain adviser, told reporters canvassers had contacted 5.3m potential voters over the last week, either by phone or in person, compared with 1.9m at the same stage in 2004.</p> <p>McCain, after his two-day bus tour of Ohio, will continue to try and hang on to other battleground states Bush took in the last elections. He is to spend the weekend in Virginia and New Hampshire.</p> <p>DuHaime disputed poll figures in the New York Times that suggested McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, was a drag on his campaign, saying nothing could be further from the truth. He said she had attracted 20,000 to a rally yesterday in contrast with only 800 people who turned out for Obama's running mate, Joe Biden.</p> <p>Some 59% of voters surveyed in the Times poll said Palin was not ready to be president.</p> <p>Palin suffered a further blow when the longtime McCain ally and former Republican cabinet member, Lawrence Eagleburger, was categorical in saying she was not up for the job.</p> <p>Asked by National Public Radio yesterday if Palin was equipped to take over in a crisis, Eagleburger said: \"Of course not.\"</p>",
  "<p>I guess in the final analysis I think that Obama probably won't do a quckie Arizona stop. This kind of thing just isn't his style. He's a stick-to-the-game-plan type if I've ever seen one.</p> <p>I did like the thought of it, though. Now that I've said this watch him do it after all...</p> <p>Late-breaking note: A <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/10/31/11279/222/947/647893 \">new poll for Daily Kos </a>shows Arizona 48-47 McCain. Before you say \"yeah, Daily Kos,\" bear in mind that Kos' daily tracking of the national numbers has shown McCain gaining a little ground lately, from 10 or 11 to today's six. So there's absolutely no reason to think the numbers are cooked.<br></p>",

He's accusing Obama of having \"a long track record of being around anti-Semitic and anti-Israel and anti-American rhetoric,\" so Sanchez presses him to name \"one other person\" he's acquainted with who's anti-Semitic except the Columbia professor Rashid Khalidi. (That Sanchez unquestioningly <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/30/AR2008103003244.html\">buys the McCain campaign line</a> that Khalidi's an anti-Semite himself is a separate problem.) Clearly, Goldfarb wants to mention Reverend Jeremiah Wright. But McCain has ruled Wright off the table. Then again, there's apparently no other answer that would be remotely convincing. Goldfarb can't say \"Jeremiah Wright\", but he can't not say \"Jeremiah Wright\" either. And so... he doesn't say anything. Problem solved!</p> <p>UPDATE: At Hit &amp; Run, Matt Welch <a href=\"http://www.reason.com/blog/show/129793.html\">makes the point</a> that putting Goldfarb up for this interview in the first place is just the latest in a long line of examples of the McCain campaign's stunning lack of discipline.<br></p>",

  "<p>Rima and Tareef Nashashibi must be the most intriguing siblings in politics. Migrants to the United States from Palestine, they both love America, civil liberties and apple pie. They are both highly significant political figures in their home state of California, and devote all of their free time to campaigning. The difference however, is that whilst Rima is a Democrat, her brother is a staunch Republican.</p> <p>\"It's just our make-up and the paths we've taken,\" said Tareef. \"I started out a small businessman, she was always an activist with causes, so the Democrats were the best fit for her. The older I got, the more conservative I became. I think having children changes you.\"</p> <p>When you ask Rima why her views are so different to her brother's she takes a deep breath. \"Seriously\", she says in a sombre tone, \"He was dropped on his head as a baby.\"</p> <p>In next month's presidential election, the majority of America's 2.4 million Muslims are likely to vote with Rima rather than Tareef. </p> <p>A survey carried out by the Pew Research Centre last year found that 63% of American Muslims identify with the Democrats as compared with 11% for Republicans.</p> <p>The votes of Arab Muslims however, are less difficult to predict. </p> <p>This group, which makes up one quarter of America's total Muslim population, tends to be more conservative than their black and Asian counterparts. In Rima and Tareef's home of Orange county, the Arab Muslim population has helped sustain Republican rule. </p> <p>\"Arabs are often socially conservative and successful in business, so they tend to assume they are Republican,\" said Rima. \"But they never look up the fine print of what that means.\" </p> <p>Tareef might not look like a traditional Republican, but his values are totally in tune with the party. As a highly paid manager in a construction firm, Tareef says he finds the small government, low tax and anti-union policies of the right attractive because they suit his business. He also says he is \"automatically drawn in\" by the social values of the party - family, order, patriotism - on account of his ethnicity. </p> <p>Rima also has a high-flying career. In between her duties as the vice chair of the Democratic Party for Orange County, she holds down a day job at American International Group (AIG). </p> <p>So why is Rima - given that she is an Arab-Muslim property owner who helps manage an investment bank - not also voting for the right? \"If I were to follow the herd I'd be a Republican, but you have to be socially responsible,\" she said. \"In truth it's got nothing to do with my background - the Democrats are simply a party for people who believe in good jobs, good education and a balanced budget.\"</p> <p>Although both Rima and Tareef admit that their political beliefs are often a source of conflict, they insist that politics has never got in the way of their close personal relationship. Rima \u2013 who doesn't have children of her own - moved from Seal Beach to Laguna Hills to be closer to her brother and his family. </p> <p>She can regularly be found at Tareef's house indulging in some of his Arabic cooking, \"I know where my bread is buttered, know what I'm saying?\" she says with a chuckle, \"Of course we have heated arguments over dinner - I rub his nose in the last hardcore Republican that's converted to the Democrats - but it's friendly competition and sibling rivalry at its best. We never let politics get in the way. Family comes first.\"</p> <p>In fact at times, the ideological split between Rima and Tareef doesn't so much feel like a hostile dividing line, but an affectionate bond that brings them closer together \u2013 they are like two peas in a politically confused pod.</p> <p>Perhaps their most amusing collaborative endeavour is their joint stand-up comedy routine You the Republican, Me the Democrat, which raised $120,000 for the Middle East Student Initiative earlier this year. In these entirely improvised shows, Tareef stands at the podium whilst Rima wonders about the audience heckling him from a cordless mike. </p> <p>\"It just comes out spontaneously,\" said Rima. \"He'll say something like 'You might be a Democrat Sis but we're still in Orange county!' and I'll say 'Yeah right \u2013 but have you looked at the electoral register recently?'\"</p> <p>Rima's jibe hits home. In Orange county and elsewhere, the Republican's traditional base of Arab-Muslim support has been slowly slipping away under the policies pursued by President Bush since 9/11. </p> <p>According to Pew's research, 71% of Muslims who describe themselves as conservative say they now disapprove of Bush's performance. The terrorism-driven clamp down on civil liberties at home and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan abroad have tested the loyalty of some of the party's most devout Arab supporters. </p> <p>\"The fine print of what it means to be a Republican is coming to the surface and the community is starting to change,\" said Rima. \"Obama's victory shows that people are sick of the status quo \u2013 we can win this election.\" </p> <p>For once Tareef agrees with his sister, admitting that it has become harder to hold his head up as a Republican in the Muslim community. \"People ask me how I can still be a member and I say I chose the party because of its ideals, not because of its presidency,\" he said.</p> <p>\"In the past the Republican party was the leader of ethnic outreach. But then the neo-cons came and the Republicans have fallen behind. Of course it can be changed if the right people come along, but I don't think McCain will make any difference. He has deep-seated issues with the Arab world.\"</p> <p>Rima notes with a smile, \"My brother is more of a Democrat than he thinks.\"</p> <p>Since 9/11 Rima and Tareef have found their political beliefs steadily moving closer together. It started in 2002 when the Bush administration brought in \"special registration\". Introduced in reaction to the terrorist attacks, this legislation required every Arab male over 16 to register with the government. Failing to register or produce legal documentation was grounds for deportation. No other migrant communities were subject to these procedures. </p> <p>\"It was a flashback to the regressive regimes many people left to pursue the American dream,\" said Rima. \"Stereotyping, discrimination \u2013 it was the worst kind of racial profiling.\" </p> <p>Both siblings opposed the proposals, \"Rima would lobby the Democrats and I would lobby the Republicans,\" said Tareef. \"When we speak on record together, people know we are speaking on behalf of the whole community because both parties are represented.\" </p> <p>The siblings continued to work in coalition when the Iraq war started in 2003, sharing political contacts and organising joint community meetings. </p> <p>\"Most Republicans were so gung-ho about supporting the war I felt like a traitor for opposing it,\" said Tareef, \"but the whole public basis for the war was lies and misconceptions.\"</p> <p>\"I've lived in the Middle East so I saw things through a different filter. I knew that Iraq and Afghanistan would never let a foreign power control them, and everything we warned about came true.\"</p> <p>It was shortly after the Iraq war started that Tareef significantly scaled down his role in the Republican party, ending his presidency of the Arab American Club for Orange County in 2004 and stepping down from the state's central committee in 2006. </p> <p>Although he cites health reasons and other priorities, he admits that Iraq, \"along with the whole neo-con agenda\" played some part in his decision to reduce his Republican commitments. Yet he refuses to hand in his membership. \"If I leave then no one will listen to me,\" he said, \"If you join a party and you disagree with a particular policy you have a democratic way of changing that. You have to be part of the system if you want it to change.\"</p> <p>Children of a Palestinian family, Rima and Tareef were born and raised in Jerusalem. The Nashashibis have always been a political clan; their father was a co-founder of the Palestinian National Liberation League, and met the brother of his future wife whilst defending the city of Jerusalem in 1948. </p> <p>\"My father always encouraged my political activism as much as he did my brothers,\" said Rima, \"Politics is in our blood as Palestinians and as Nashashibis.\" </p> <p>The family moved to Orange county in 1980, but Rima regularly returns to her homeland, and in 2005 was sent by the state department to help run campaigning workshops for Palestinian women in the run up to the national elections. \"I felt kinship with the people I was working with\" she said, \"We are one people, whether we are in the diaspora or the occupied territories. A lot of them want me to move back, but I know that staying in the States is the best way to help them. The real decisions are made here.\"</p> <p>Although Rima is convinced that Obama would offer more hope for Palestinians than McCain, she is not unrealistic about the Democrats' potential for achieving peace in the Middle East, \"If we're working on the same principles of Oslo and Madrid then anything we produce is going to be a band aid and not address the real cause of the problem,\" she said. </p> <p>\"I love the party but I don't love it blindly. The obligation is on us to educate party decisions.\"</p> <p>Tareef, who also remains highly conscious of his roots, is equally sceptical of both parties' commitments to help his homeland. </p> <p>\"Foreign policy on this issue doesn't really change regardless of whether the government is Republican or Democrat. It depends who you are talking to \u2013 there are different personal, not party, platforms.\"</p> <p>Irrespective of their political differences, Rima and Tareef both want change. At the moment, only Obama seems to be offering it. </p> <p>The country will have to wait and see whether the Democrats' platform is enough to attract the disaffected Arab vote from its traditional Republican base. </p> <p>Tareef's two children, Mufeed and Rasha, diplomatically keep their emerging political opinions to themselves. Whether they'll grow up to support Daddy's Republicans or Aunty's Democrats is not yet known.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.crim.ox.ac.uk/people/researchassociates/roger.htm\">Roger Hood</a> and <a href=\"http://www.crim.ox.ac.uk/people/academic/carolyn.htm\">Carolyn Hoyle</a>'s extraordinary and painstaking new edition of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Death-Penalty-Worldwide-Perspective/dp/0199228477/ref=sr_1_1/279-4601856-7526052?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1225393896&amp;sr=8-1\">The Death Penalty: A Worldwide Perspective</a> has just landed on my desk. Now in its fourth edition, it has been some six years since the last edition appeared and since then 16 countries have completely abolished capital punishment and the number that have executed anyone within the past 10 years has fallen by a quarter \u2013 from 71 to 51 by the end of 2007.</p> <p>One of those countries which continues to use <a href=\"http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/pages/deathpenalty-facts-eng\">capital punishment</a> is the United States, and Hood and Hoyle's book had gone to print before the presidential campaign got into full swing, and before the supreme court ruled in Kennedy v Louisiana in June 2008 \u2013 a decision which outlawed the use of the death penalty in cases where offenders had raped children. That made me start to wonder where Obama <a href=\"http://pewforum.org/religion08/compare.php?Issue=Death_Penalty\">stood on the death penalty</a> \u2013 given that McCain has said repeatedly in the past that he is in favour, and what an incoming Obama administration might do in relation to the United States being the last western democracy to use capital punishment.</p> <p>A quick look at Obama's previous public statements on capital punishment shows a certain amount of what can only be described as \"trimming\". In other words, his position seems to have been trimmed to better suit the reality that he has moved from community activist to presidential candidate. So, while he was at one stage against the death penalty \u2013 he argued that it did little to deter crime, in a country that is 65% behind maintaining capital punishment he has now positioned himself to support capital punishment in cases which \"the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage\". In short, he wants it in those situations which Professor <a href=\"http://old.nyls.edu/pages/347.asp\">Robert Blecker</a> of New York University would describe as \"the worst of the worse\". </p> <p>Some indication of what this means in practice \u2013 both in terms of what is meant by the \"worst of the worse\", and in relation to what Obama might actually do in office \u2013 can be measured in his response to the Supreme Court's ruling on <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-343.ZO.html\">Kennedy v Louisiana</a>. By all stretches of the imagination Patrick Kennedy's aggravated rape of his eight year old stepdaughter in March 1998 was horrific and repulsive. So great was his stepdaughter's injuries that a laceration to the left wall of her vagina had separated her cervix from the back of her vagina, which caused her rectum to protrude into the vaginal structure. Kennedy was sentenced to death given the age of his stepdaughter when he was found guilty of aggravated rape.</p> <p>The supreme court ruled that this sentence was unconstitutional four months ago \u2013 in effect ruling that the death penalty could only be used when another's life had been taken - and thereby forcing Obama to reveal his hand. In <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/06/25/politics/p145123D44.DTL\">response</a> he stated that he opposed what the supreme court had done and argued that \"I think that the rape of a small child, six or eight years old, is a heinous crime and if a state makes a decision that under narrow, limited, well-defined circumstances the death penalty is at least potentially applicable, that does not violate our constitution.\" In other words there was no way that Obama was going to be \"soft on crime\", and in the American context that means he is going to support capital punishment.</p> <p>Of course as a skilled, liberal lawyer, Obama gave himself room to manoeuvre here and the phrase \"at least potentially applicable\" is open enough to interpretation to allow death penalty abolitionists to continue to give their support to Obama. And after all, unlike governor Bill Clinton, he hasn't left the campaign trail to <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEED91F3EF936A15752C0A964958260\">return to Little Rock</a> so as to sign the death warrant of a mentally retarded man on death row in Arkansas. However, the big test for Obama should he be elected \u2013 which looks likely \u2013 will be how he deals with the supreme court. Specifically how he replaces two supreme court judges who for one reason or another are likely to step down during his first term in office \u2013 88-year old <a href=\"http://www.supremecourthistory.org/myweb/justice/stevens.htm\">John Paul Stevens</a> (a liberal on death penalty cases despite being a Republican nominee) and <a href=\"http://www.supremecourthistory.org/myweb/justice/ginsburg.htm\">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> who is in her seventies and has been ill with cancer. Finding replacements for Stevens and Ginsberg will tilt and colour the dynamics of the supreme court as President Obama sees fit, and if he really does want the United States to \"lead the world\" he should be mindful that every western democratic legal jurisdiction has its own appalling crimes to deal with and that we have all managed to cope without resorting to capital punishment.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's campaign has dropped three US newspapers from its travelling plane in the final days of the election, drawing fire from conservatives who see a pattern: all three have endorsed John McCain.</p> <p>Reporters from the Washington Times, the Rupert Murdoch-owned New York Post, and the Dallas Morning News were told last night that space had run out on Obama's plane for his final campaign swing.</p> <p>The conservative-leaning Drudge Report website fuelled the story today by suggesting that the newspapers were frozen out because their editorial pages have endorsed McCain. The Washington Times added to the controversy by publishing a story criticising its exclusion.</p> <p>\"This feels like the journalistic equivalent of redistributing the wealth,\" Times executive editor John Solomon said - echoing the McCain camp's recent attacks on Obama for suggesting that tax policy should help \"share the wealth\".</p> <p>\"[W]e spent hundreds of thousands of dollars covering Senator Obama's campaign, travelling on his plane, and taking our turn in the reporter's pool,\" Solomon added, \"only to have our seat given away to someone else in the last days of the campaign.\"</p> <p>Although the Times and Post are considered conservative media outlets, the US press traditionally maintains strict separation between editorials and news coverage. In an email quoted by the Times, the Obama camp said the exclusion of the three newspapers was prompted by dwindling space, not ideology.</p> <p>\"Unfortunately, demand for seats on the plane during this final weekend has far exceeded supply,\" Anita Dunn, a senior Obama adviser, wrote. </p> <p>\"This means we've had to make hard, and unpleasant for all concerned, decisions about limiting some news organizations and in some cases not being in a position to offer space to news organisations altogether.\"</p> <p>The McCain campaign has had its own share of controversial ejections from its travelling media corps this year. Joe Klein of Time magazine and Maureen Dowd of the New York Times, both liberal-leaning columnists, have been barred from the McCain press circuit after publishing articles critical of the Republican nominee.</p>",

The Democratic nominee begins his day in Iowa \u2013 the site of his first primary triumph 10 months ago \u2013 before moving on to Indiana and Nevada. </p> <p>McCain, meanwhile, is completing a bus tour through Ohio, the state he is increasingly pinning his hopes on as polls show Obama holding on to a lead in most of the key battlegrounds. </p> <p>\"I'm confident we'll win [in Ohio],\" the Republican candidate told ABC News this morning. The Californian governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, will be by McCain's side today in that crucial state.</p> <p>In America's other perennial swing state, Florida, there is no lack of political players.

Bill Clinton will campaign in West Virginia and New Hampshire.</p> <p>The goal of this furious pace is not only to court still-vulnerable voters but also to attract national attention at a time when the media has largely ceased covering policy in order to focus on the election map. </p> <p>Obama is well positioned to project an aura of confidence as he traipses through states George Bush won easily in 2000 and 2004, while McCain cannot even take his home state of Arizona for granted \u2013 he has started running automated phone calls there attacking Obama as unprepared.</p> <p>Despite the recent wave of bad news for McCain, two bright spots emerged for him this morning: Missouri and North Carolina. A poll released today by Politico.com found the race neck and neck in both states, a tightening from earlier surveys that had found Obama slightly ahead.</p>",
  "<p>It's hard to believe, I know, but the McCain campaign seems intent on delving further and further into the gutter in its desperate attempt to tar Barack Obama with something - anything - that will undermine the trust he's earned from voters for the past two years. The most recent episode involves a full-court press in speeches and interviews by both candidates and their surrogates to inspire yet another McCarthyite panic, this one among Jews (especially those in Florida, no doubt).</p> <p>To review, five years ago Barack Obama spoke at the same dinner as Rashid Khalidi, a noted scholar and current professor at Columbia University. There were some harsh things said by others at the dinner, but not by Khalidi or Obama. Obama \"called for finding common ground\" in his remarks and said that his commitment to Israel's security is \"nonnegotiable\", according to the Los Angeles Times, which wrote <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-obamamideast10apr10,0,5826085.story\">an extensive account of the dinner</a> six months ago. The reporter, Peter Wallsten, based that story on a videotape of the dinner, which was provided to him by a source on the condition that it not be released.</p> <p>Now right-wingers are demanding that the tape be released. \"A major news organisation is intentionally suppressing information that could provide a clearer link between Barack Obama and Rashid Khalidi,\" said McCain campaign spokesman <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-video29-2008oct29,0,5458024.story\">Michael Goldfarb</a>. \"The election is one week away, and it's unfortunate that the press so obviously favours Barack Obama that this campaign must publicly request that the Los Angeles Times do its job - make information public.\" Sarah Palin, on the stump in Ohio on Wednesday, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27439939/\">said</a>: \"Among other things, Israel was described there as the perpetrator of terrorism rather than the victim. What we don't know is how Barack Obama responded to these slurs on a country that he professes to support.\" (Note: professes to support).</p> <p>McCain, sans any evidence whatsoever, claims that, hey, maybe William Ayers was there too. He told Larry King on Wednesday: \"I still think, you know, we're watching now, a major newspaper has a tape that apparently has Mr William Ayers in it. I don't know if it does or not. That's the allegation. But that newspaper and their parent, the Tribune Company, and the Obama campaign refuse to release that. Shouldn't the American people know about that? At least they should have full information.\" There's even <a href=\"http://michellemalkin.com/2008/10/30/protest-at-the-la-times/\">a protest outside the LA Times</a>.</p> <p>This pathetic effort should, in a normal world, be laughed off the airwaves and news pages. First and most importantly, Khalidi is not someone that anyone should be ashamed to know. He is a noted and well-respected Palestinian scholar. Michael Hudson, director of the Centre for Contemporary Arab Studies at Georgetown, <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/10/29/rudy-khalidi-mccain/\">describes Khalidi as pre-eminent in his field</a>, a courageous scholar and public figure. John McCain apparently thought so too at one point, since the International Republican Institute, with McCain at the helm, gave Khalidi's Centre for Palestine Research and Studies a $448,000 grant in the late 1990s.</p> <p>No concrete offence of Khalidi's has actually been alleged, so far as I'm aware, except that he once served as spokesman for the PLO, which <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2008/articles/2008/10/30/mccain_pressures_la_times_on_release_of_obama_videotape/\">Khalidi denies</a>. Still, McCain made this <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27439939/\">stunning comparison</a> on Wednesday: \"If there was a tape of John McCain in a neo-Nazi outfit, I think the treatment of the issue would be slightly different,\" he said in an interview with Hispanic radio stations.</p> <p>This modern-day McCarthyism seems to rely much more on the fact that Rashid Khalidi's name is Rashid Khalidi than any concrete allegations of wrongdoing. And the haphazard insinuation that maybe Ayers was there too is a transparent attempt to bait the Times into releasing the tape. The McCain people must know that a journalist cannot and will not burn a source. \"The Los Angeles Times did not publish the videotape because it was provided to us by a confidential source who did so on the condition that we not release it,\" said the newspaper's editor, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-video29-2008oct29,0,5458024.story\">Russ Stanton</a>. \"The Times keeps its promises to sources.\"</p> <p>Perhaps Sarah Palin is actually ignorant enough about journalism to believe the foolish charge she utters when <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27439939/\">complaining</a>: \"It must be nice for a candidate to have major news organisations looking out for their best interests like that. Politicians would love to have a pet newspaper of their very own.\" But surely Goldfarb, who left the Weekly Standard to join McCain's campaign, knows better, and is playing the dim bulb for purely political purposes. (All this will no doubt keep him in good standing with his colleagues at the Standard, alas.) </p> <p>Sadly, the media has been more than happy to provide that noise. \"Sen John McCain \u2026 continued to criticize the radical professors with whom Sen Barack Obama \u2026 has associations,\" explained ABC's <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/10/mccain-again-bo.html \">Jake Tapper</a>, simply assuming that Khalidi fit this description without any apparent familiarity with his work. \"McCain attacked Obama for associating with both William Ayers and Rashid Khalidi on CNN's Larry King Live tonight.\"</p> <p>In King's conversation with McCain, he too, bought into the crazy notion that the LA Times was somehow suppressing the news that the newspaper, alone, had reported. Last night on CNN, Anderson Cooper summed up the MSM attitude perfectly: \"McCain and Palin are making a big deal about this Palestinian-American professor. We don't take sides on this programme. We just want the facts, so we asked Tom Foreman to look into this guy and allegations of a relationship with Obama and McCain.\"</p> <p>A long package ensued. The only sensible perspective provided by CNN last night was this, from Dana Bash: \"When I asked the McCain aide why they are just now bringing up a six-month-old article about a dinner five years ago, the aide was strikingly candid. He said - quote - 'Because Obama may be one week away from being elected president.'\"</p> <p>Really, one shudders for the fate of the free world when one considers the combination of stupidity, tastelessness, bigotry and outright idiocy that lies at the centre of this appeal.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/johnlewis\">John Lewis</a> suffered a 9.8% fall in sales at its department stores last week compared with a year ago, and warned of a \"testing Christmas\" as the economic downturn gathers pace.</p> <p>The earlier timing of last year's school half-term may have affected the figure to last Saturday, but John Lewis said it was clear that customers were being \"far more judicious\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/retail\">in their spending in the face of recession</a>.</p> <p>Singer analyst Matthew McEachran said the figures implied sales declines in the \"high teens\" on a same-store basis. Sales at the group's upmarket food chain, Waitrose, edged up 0.6% in the week to October 25, a figure which he said implied a like-for-like decline.</p> <p>All categories were down at John Lewis department stores, in particular sales of items for the home, which fell 17.3%, and electrical goods, down 9.6%. Fashion sales dropped by 1.3%.</p> <p>Northern stores outperformed the south, where Milton Keynes, Cribbs Causeway near Bristol, Southampton and Watford suffered sales falls of more than 20%. Growth at the John Lewis website slowed to 7.8% from 24%.</p> <p>\"The third quarter of the year ended on a subdued note, coinciding as it did with confirmation that the UK economy shrank during this period,\" said Andy Street, John Lewis's managing director. \"The effect can clearly be seen in our trade \u2013 with a distinct softening since the summer.\"</p> <p>With 55 days to go until Christmas, Street said: \"For sure, it is going to be a testing Christmas, but our readiness is second to none.\" </p> <p>Retail analyst Freddie George at Seymour Pierce said John Lewis would have been affected by the timing of half term and discounting at a number of competitors, including Debenhams, House of Fraser and Bhs. \"We understand that sales have strongly recovered in the current week,\" he said.</p> <p>However, George has slashed his profit estimates for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/31/marksspencer-retail\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a> and today, Ted Baker, \"predominantly because we are concerned about the medium-term outlook, the impact of the downturn on high spending urban shoppers and an increase in the level of discount activity\". He warned that next year would be even bleaker for retailers.</p> <p>Given that John Lewis department store sales are seen as a bellwether for the health of consumer spending, Howard Archer at Global Insight described the plunge in last week's sales as \"extremely worrying\". \"This heightens fears that the economy will suffer from an extended period of serious consumer retrenchment. This is particularly bad news for retailers as the vital Christmas period gets under way,\" he said. </p> <p>Blacks Leisure, the struggling outdoor retailer, today reported half-year losses widened by 55% to \u00a36.7m, but insisted it was making good progress on its turnaround plan. The company, which has 428 stores selling camping equipment and outdoor clothing, said sales dropped by 9.4% over the six months to the end of August.</p>",
  "<p>I'm trying to understand <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/30/russell-brand-ross-sachs-bbc\">the tremendous furore</a> in Britain over Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross' lewd performance on the BBC. Really, I am. </p> <p>But for those of us on the other side of the Atlantic, can someone please explain why this uproar has commenced over offending an actor who became famous by offensively caricaturing Hispanics as uneducated (<a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=jSfyWbg0JV4&amp;feature=related\">and worthy of beatings</a>)? Seriously, the difference between the BBC's envelope-pushing humour of the 1970s and its envelope-pushing humour of today comes down to John Cleese being funnier than Russell Brand. </p> <p>If the true source of outrage over the Brand-Ross phone calls comes from concern over the BBC's use of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/licencefee/\">its license fees from the public</a>, then the brouhaha makes more sense. </p> <p>Requiring households to support a sprawling broadcast empire is hardly a mainstream notion in America, as <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/09/AR2005060902283.html\">the frequent battles over</a> our (profanity-free) public television demonstrate. But I can certainly share in the scepticism over treating questionable public investments as sacred ground. After all, how can John McCain <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/29/lkl.mccain.excerpts/\">continue to hammer at</a> Barack Obama for not <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/pubfund.shtml\">taking taxpayer money</a> for his campaign? Since when is it a bad thing to spare the public a dubious bill for <a href=\"http://video.aol.com/video-detail/mccain-compared-obama-to-britneynow-moses/3711906836\">lame jokes about Britney and Moses</a>? </p> <p>But it seems the row cuts deeper than even the BBC, as Britons ask themselves whether the character of their culture has been irreversibly debased. The answer, indisputably, is no. Monty Python's best routines are more indecorous than Brand and Ross' silly cracks about a grandfather despairing that his little grandaughter enjoys sex \u2013 think <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=BlK62rjQWLk\">Mr Creosote</a> or Brian <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=jHPOzQzk9Qo&amp;feature=related\">breaking into song</a> during his crucifixion. But, again, the only crime the BBC hosts committed was attempting far inferior offensive comedy.</p> <p>In a world where 82-year-old Cloris Leachman <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26844408/\">becomes the shock hit</a> of a reality TV dancing show, where an <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25640691/\">80-year-old exotic dancer</a> can still strut her stuff, and where Sean Connery remains a sex symbol at the same age as Sachs, why is it unconscionable for a couple of comedians to rib an older man about the dirty deed? Given that Brand has been confirmed as an ex-lover of the granddaughter whose virtue was impugned in this case, is it any more beyond the pale than the 2006 film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/10/1\">that imagined the assassination</a> of George Bush?</p> <p>Please, let's move on to a more meaningful debate about media - the death knell of print journalism heralded this week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/29/pressandpublishing-digitalmedia\">by the Christian Science Monitor</a>, perhaps? Bollocks. If we're looking for a good ruckus over humour and offence, let's talk about whether the <a href=\"http://showhype.com/video/mccain_advisor_carly_fiorina_tina_fey_as_sarah_palin/\">\"sexism\" charge</a>thrown at Tina Fey's Sarah Palin imitation is, in itself, insulting.</p> <p>Oh no.

  "<p>There's a frenzied and frazzled, yet curiously static, feel to the campaign at this point, as John McCain throws everything he can at Barack Obama, and Obama fights to keep his supporters energised all the way to the finish line. (Everyone, you sense, just wants it to be over - <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=64442a77-1d23-487b-af08-68d26b6da713\">reporters especially</a>.) Yesterday played out mainly to Obama's advantage, with a continued wide lead in a New York Times poll, and the news that about one in five US households had tuned in to his 30-minute infomercial on Wednesday night. But there were one or two glimmers of light for McCain and signs of peril for Obama. Some polls do show a shrinkage in the Democrat's lead - \"there's no question there's a closing in this campaign,\" McCain's campaign manager said - while a poll in Florida showed that only 15% of those under 35 had so far voted, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/31/barack-obama-john-mccain-election-polls\">Ewen Macaskill writes</a>. That's a crucial demographic for Obama, but the worst-performing group in the survey; repeated nationwide, it could seriously dent his lead. And it remained to be seen whether the race would be imapcted by a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE49T76620081030?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true\">video message</a> that surfaced late yesterday from an al-Qaida leader, Abu Yahya al-Libi, who called on God to \"humiliate Bush and his party ... degrade and defy him,\" though he didn't mention either candidate. </p> <p>Meanwhile, attention turns to the mechanics of Tuesday's vote, and the possibility of legal challenges. A team of 5,000 volunteer lawyers representing the Democrats will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/31/elections-democrats-fair-polling-obama\">descend on Florida</a>, headed by the attorney who became known, in 2000, as \"the Hanging Chad Guy\"; similar efforts will be put in place nationwide. The biggest concern, writes <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/us/politics/31ohio.html?hp\">Ian Urbina in the New York Times</a> is over provisional ballots, which voters are required to use when their identity or registration status can't be immediately verified. The problem is especially acute in the crucial swing state of Ohio, where the election could be very close. \"Provisional ballots are really the Achilles' heel of our electoral process, because in a close race that is the pressure point lawyers use to try to undo the results,\" says Edward Foley, a voter litigation expert at Ohio State University. \"The larger the number of provisional ballots cast in a state, the more vulnerable the Achilles' heel, and Ohio has for a couple of elections used more of these ballots than most any other state.\"</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>The big guns are out: Arnold Schwarzenegger campaigns with John McCain in Ohio today, while Al and Tipper Gore campaign on Obama's behalf in Florida, the ground zero of Gore's 2000 defeat. Obama visits Iowa and Indiana before returning to Chicago to be \"Trick-or-Treater-in-Chief\" for his daughters' Halloween celebrations, his senior advisor Robert Gibbs said, though it was \"unclear about whether he would actually go trick or treating with his daughters\". And might Obama really make a last-minute appearance on Saturday Night Live this weekend? It's being rumoured ...</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Despite a narrowing in one or two tracking polls, Obama maintains his decisive national lead in a new CBS/New York Times poll, which puts him at 52% to McCain's 41%. Fifty-nine per cent of voters in the survey said they felt Sarah Palin wasn't prepared to be vice-president - an increase of nine points since early October.</p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"Joe's with us today. Joe, where are you? Where is Joe? Is Joe here with us today? Joe, I thought you were here today. All right. Well, you're all Joe the Plumber. So all of you stand up.\" If you read that with the correct rhythm, it sounds positively poetic. In real life, though, it was a pretty awkward moment for John McCain at a rally yesterday in Defiance, Ohio - watch it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/oct/30/uselections2008-johnmccain\">here</a>.</p> <h2>Voicemail message of the day</h2> <p>A call apparently made by an Obama volunteer to a prospective voter suggests the pressure of campaigning may be driving <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5070495/obamas-volunteers-just-drunk-at-this-point?autoplay=true\">some to drink</a>.</p> <h2>Ingenious web tool of the day</h2> <p>Chart the progress of recent (mostly political) <a href=\"http://www.shiftingthedebate.com/shifting/videobarometer.html\">viral videos</a> through the liberal and conservative blogosphere.</p> <h2>Coming up</h2> <p>This email returns on Monday for the final days of the race, and the morning after.

  "<p>Rahm Emanuel, a Democratic congressman from Illinois, has emerged as a possible candidate for the key job of White House chief of staff if <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> wins the US presidency.</p> <p>Unnamed Democrats have told the Associated Press that Obama's campaign has approached Emanuel about taking on the role. Tom Daschle, the highly respected former Senate Democratic leader, has also been connected with the position.</p> <p>Emanuel worked in Bill Clinton's White House and is now a member of the House Democratic leadership. </p> <p>Obama, who holds a comfortable lead in the polls, played down talk of potential top-level appointments to deflect accusations that he was overconfident.

  "<p>Representing the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_and_East\">City and East</a> constituency, <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/assembly/members/biggsj.jsp\">John Biggs</a> has a particular responsibility towards some of London's least affluent citizens. His various Assembly duties include chairing the Budget and Performance Committee and needling Mayor Johnson at question time. </p> <blockquote> <p>The economic situation is creating great uncertainty for us in London. While there has rightly been much written about financial services job cuts, I suspect the bigger impact will be on those that support the financial sector, wider business support and the leisure and tourism industries. Another very visible casualty will undoubtedly be the construction sector, with house builders closing down building sites across the city as the market for buyers seizes up and prices slip.<br> It would be easy to view the downturn as primarily affecting the middle classes. But this is by no means the whole picture. As an elected representative for some of London's poorest citizens, I am acutely aware that those at the bottom will be squeezed the hardest - whether it is those in low paid service economy jobs, or construction, or those who are looking for a decent home but are unable to compete in the market place. So what should we do? It is early days yet but not too early to think about the future. Although London has been written-off by many as a manufacturing location, the reality is that the sector has been so battered for decades that what remains, provided there is demand for its products, is quite strong and battle-hardened. If financial services are struggling, sectors like manufacturing may take some of the strain. As regards construction I would argue that this is just the right time for public investment to meet needs and to stimulate activity in the construction industry and the market place - so a major programme of house building and infrastructure projects would be a very good idea. </p> <p>We need also, and we should never tire of this, to emphasise that in an open economy like London/the UK, investment in skills and infrastructure are vital if we are to hold our own against growing competition. So I would renew the emphasis on skills training, and lobby hard for investment in projects like Crossrail and the Olympic legacy, and housing. These are uncertain and difficult times but we should not be deterred from investing in London's future. <br> So what does this mean for our Mayor, Boris Johnson? In tough times politicians like to bury their differences but, conversely, their differences become all the more important. Boris has made some of the right noises, especially on the need deliver Crossrail. But on housing, for example, he seems to be stuck in an ideological cul de sac. The next few months will be a big test for the Mayor. We will soon see just how much of London he understands and just how committed he is to its needs.</p> </blockquote> <p>The previous contributors to this series are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/davehillblog/2008/oct/16/london-london\">Jo Valentine</a> of London First, Lib Dem <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/davehillblog/2008/oct/21/london-london\">Mike Tuffrey</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/davehillblog/2008/oct/26/kenlivingstone-borisjohnson\">Ken Livingstone</a> and the Greens' <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/davehillblog/2008/oct/28/borisjohnson-jennyjones\">Jenny Jones</a>.</p>",

Race, they insisted, was still a central issue in the election, and in US politics and society. </p> <p>They could hardly believe they were on the verge of seeing an African American elected president - and they knew that an Obama victory would not mean that the struggle for equality was over. They were realistic, even sceptical, of what lay ahead.</p> <p>The women's scepticism is borne out by the election itself: even with a black man on the ballot, African American voters continue to face barriers at the polls, as they have to one degree or another throughout US history. </p> <p>Black men may have obtained the constitutional right to vote following the civil war, followed by black and white women in 1920. But especially in the south, African Americans, along with other minorities and poor people of all races, were kept from voting <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~lawrace/disenfranchise1.htm\">through other means</a>, including poll taxes, literacy tests, and restrictive registration procedures. </p> <p>While formal poll taxes were declared illegal in 1965 with the passage of the Voting Rights Act, versions of it remain in place - for instance, in the cost of taking time off work, travelling to the polls, or obtaining identification. </p> <p>African American votes are now discounted by many other means, as well. In Florida in 2000, the suppression of black votes changed the final outcome of the presidential election. The <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/transcripts/ccrdraft060401.htm\">US Commission on Civil Rights</a> found \"widespread disenfranchisement and denial of voting rights\" in Florida, which was ten times more likely to affect African Americans. </p> <p>More than 57,000 voters were \"purged\" from the voting rolls as supposed felons; over half were black, and more than 90% were innocent. In addition, <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/doc/20040517/palast\">the report found</a>, thousands of eligible African Americans were turned away because their registration forms had never been processed, and thousands more had their votes tossed out on account of \"spoilage\" rendered by the \"antiquated and error-prone equipment\" more likely to be found in poor and minority areas. In 2000, the spoilage rate for black votes in Florida was 14.4%, or one in seven; for white votes it was 1.6%. </p> <p>In 2004, some of <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A64737-2004Dec14?language=\" printer\" \">the worst cases of vote suppression</a> took place here in Ohio, where voters who were non-white, poor, young, or newly registered were far more likely to find their names expunged from the voting rolls, or to face four and five-hour waits at polling stations. </p> <p>This year, in <a href=\"http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2008/10/16/brunnerappeal.html?sid=101\">a case that went all the way to the US supreme court</a>, Ohio's Democratic secretary of state, Jennifer Brunner, refused to turn over to the state Republican party a list of 200,000 newly registered voters whose information did not precisely match information on other government databases. </p> <p>Since these first-time voters clearly favour Obama, Republicans are seeking to purge as many as possible from the voting rolls by turning what are clearly innocent discrepancies into trumped-up evidence of voter fraud. </p> <p>The Ohio GOP is now running statewide ads asking, \"Could Ohio's election be stolen?\". Brunner has said that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/29/AR2008102904545_pf.html\">the Republicans are preparing the ground for challenges if Obama wins the state</a>, hoping to \"segregate and pick off ballots if it's a close race\". </p> <p>Like other states, Ohio has instituted early voting, hoping to cut down the long lines and chaos on election day, and increase access for people who can't get off work or have difficulty travelling to the polls. </p> <p>Still, in Cuyahoga County, where Cleveland is located, problems are already beginning. Volunteers and employees of the Greater Ohio Voter Coalition have been comparing lists of the people they had registered over the last year with the database of the Board of Elections. When we spoke with them, they had already found problems with about 300 of the 3700 registrations - about 8%. </p> <p>Many of these were simply missing from the system entirely. The group sends a card to the individuals with errors urging them to re-register, but fears that many of them won't make it onto the rolls by election day. </p> <p>Even the seemingly most innocent aspects of the voting process cause problems. Victoria Lovegren, a computer scientist and voting rights activist in Cleveland, argues that something as simple as the pens used to fill in the ovals on the ballots - ball points, rather than the easier and quicker felt tips - may well end up causing longer lines in areas where there are already far too few polling stations to serve the population. </p> <p>The overall impact of these seemingly insignificant obstacles comes down disproportionately on minorities, just as the poll taxes did a century ago. </p> <p>\"That's the whole shame of it,\" Lovegren said. \"They know those are the people who are going to be affected by these decisions. It was simply heartbreaking in 2004 to see the lines of people who couldn't vote.\"</p>",
  "<p>The latest tally of US newspaper endorsements in the presidential race shows <strong>Barack Obama</strong> way out in the lead. The Democratic contender leads by 234 to 105 over Republican <strong>John McCain</strong>, a better than 2-1 margin. In circulation terms, Obama is even further ahead. Papers backing him have sales of more than 21m compared to 7m for McCain. It's all very different from four years ago when <strong>John Kerry</strong> barely edged <strong>George Bush</strong> in endorsements.

  "<p>It was during the height of the era of fast-buck capitalism, at a 1988 televised concert celebrating Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday, that Tracy Chapman came out of nowhere and enthralled the world with her songs about social injustice. Just her, an acoustic guitar and a hushed Wembley Stadium. So meeting the protest singer in the exclusive surroundings of a five-star west London hotel suite feels more than a little incongruous. </p> <p>She shuffles into the room, coddling her stinking cold with a chunky red scarf, and blinks out at the magnificent view of Hyde Park. She looks reassuringly unchanged - all long dreadlocks and slouchy clothes. There is still a mighty roll to her cheekbones, and the lurgy has done nothing to cloud her gentle, wise eyes. </p> <p>Back in 1988, her eponymous first album, which included the singles Talkin' 'bout a Revolution, Fast Car and Baby Can I Hold You, went on to be a No 1 hit on both sides of the Atlantic. Her follow-up, Crossroads, was also a UK No 1. Since then, Chapman has continued to record and tour. Next month, aged 44, she will release her eighth studio album, Our Bright Future. </p> <p>Despite the optimistic-sounding title, Chapman has not come over all saccharine. According to the song from which the album takes its name, we've been \"Led on led on/ to take the path/ where our bright future/ is in the past\". </p> <p>\"What does the future look like if the heads of society ask our young people to risk their lives for questionable causes?\" she asks, matter-of-factly in her familiar woodwind voice. \"I think it looks rather bleak.\" After 20 years of being called upon to comment on global humanitarian issues, Chapman talks with cautious measure and studied compassion. </p> <p>When she was 16 and living with her sister and single mother on welfare in Cleveland, Ohio, Chapman won a scholarship to a private boarding school in Connecticut. This, she says, was the pivotal moment in her life, and one of the reasons she is so highly politicised. \"I have always felt immensely grateful for that opportunity. Then I received an academic scholarship to go to college [where she studied anthropology and African studies]. That wouldn't have happened if there weren't people who had given something to make that possible for me.\"</p> <p>Chapman had endured a terrible childhood. \"The city had been forced to integrate the schools so they were bussing black children into white neighbourhoods, and white children into black neighbourhoods, and people were upset about it so there were race riots. A lot of kids spent more time out of school than in, but I always loved school and thought it was my way out of Cleveland, and out of poverty.\" She has said that her bookishness led to her being bullied. As, indeed, did her race. She grew accustomed to racial abuse and assaults on her way home from school. </p> <p>She started playing guitar aged 11 and was writing protest songs by her early teens. Her first album came out when she was 24. Although, she recalls, \"My first record was almost not my first record.\" After she signed the deal to make the album, the proposed producer was killed in a car accident and the record company called in someone far less experienced to take over. Chapman, four session musicians and the new producer were recording near Woodstock in New York state. \"He put me in the middle of the room. They were all around me, everybody was playing wildly because he gave them very little direction ... And the music was horrible. Bombastic.</p> <p>\"So I called the production company after a few days saying, 'This doesn't sound good.' And they were like, 'We think it's all right, just stick it out.'\" After a few more days, it still wasn't working. \"They insisted again that I continue so I just said, 'I'm leaving.'\"</p> <p>Was she the only woman in this situation? \"Yeah. It was like, you're young, you're inexperienced, you're a woman even, what do you know about any of this?'\" </p> <p>The record company eventually relented, however and her early success meant that she has been treated with respect since then. But she says she has still occasionally faced \"sexist attitudes\" when taking an active role in the production of her records. \"Say I would notice a problem with the tonality, people would say, 'Oh, that'll be fine,' or 'You're not hearing what you think you're hearing.'\"</p> <p>Is it harder for women in the industry in general? \"Definitely,\" she says. \"I was trying to make a case for Madonna the other day, saying that she's to be admired for her longevity in a genre that has mostly been for younger acts. Men are able to sustain a career into their 50s and 60s and still present themselves as sex symbols. With women on the other hand, people say, 'Why doesn't she retire?' It's just so unfair. So I have to give props to Madonna.\"</p> <p>Chapman is regularly associated with Amnesty International, the American Foundation for Aids Research, Free Tibet and the anti-war lobby, but one cause she doesn't speak about much is feminism. Is she even a feminist? \"Yeah, course. I think it just doesn't come up because ... people think we're beyond it. There have been some gains made in terms of more equality for women in the workplace and in the way the legal system deals with issues of violence against women.\" However, she says, \"taking the recent campaign for the [Democratic presidential] nomination, if you look at the way Hillary Clinton was treated compared with Barack Obama, there seemed to be a double standard. People would make comments on what she was wearing all the time, saying that she was too emotional, even hysterical, and therefore unfit to be commander in chief. Yes, we still need to have a discussion and there needs to be improvement.\"</p> <p>Though an Obama supporter, she would have been happy with Clinton. \"It's strange how things come to pass,\" she muses. \"Hillary Clinton's candidacy would not have been possible without Bill [Clinton]. And Sarah Palin's spot on the Republican ticket would not be possible without Hillary Clinton. McCain saw how popular Hillary was.\" How about Condoleezza Rice - a black woman who did it on her own? Chapman grimaces. \"I don't even want to mention her because her values are so contrary to mine. She's definitely ... It's not fair to not consider her,\" she concedes.</p> <p>\"The one good thing about Palin being on the ticket is that it continues to bring up discussion about women in politics. There's a very curious thing I saw the other day which is that she belongs to some kind of evangelical Christian religious group that doesn't allow female pastors, but her church is supporting her in her effort to be vice-president. And that same church also publicly states that women shouldn't take a leadership role in their homes. And that they should be in willing submission to their husbands. How does she deal with this?\"</p> <p>The new record isn't all politics. Rather it is a set of tenderly honed folk and country songs addressing themes of family and love, as well as war and religion. Then there's I Did It All, in which the protagonist is a washed-up soak. Chapman channels the song's lead character with vicarious glee. \"I imagine her in a smoky club, and she's stumbling around, trying to tell anyone who'll listen about what she thinks of as her glorious past,\" she giggles. \"She walks around most of the day in some kind of negligee, with tattered hems. Her hair is done but it's a little loose. Makeup, but slightly smudged lipstick.\" Chapman clearly loves this game. Is she trying to show us a little-known side of herself? \"No!\" she exclaims, before adding: \"Someone asked what I was arrested for, because they picked up on the 'They read me the rights' line [in the song], but I was not in jail!\" Then she remembers to add, \"There are good reasons for being in jail - for protesting\".</p> <p>\u2022 Tracy Chapman's new album <strong>Our Bright Future</strong> is released on November 10 by Elektra Records.

  "<h2>Paul Auster<br>Author</h2> <p>I'm hard-pressed to think of a single thing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgebush\">Bush</a> administration has done to promote the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture\">arts</a>. Things have gone on as before: novelists are writing books, people read them or don't read them, movies are being made and people go or don't go, artists are painting pictures, people are making music. I don't see that the Bush people have affected the cultural landscape that much.</p> <p>These past eight years have been about the worst that I can imagine. For the first time as a writer I've addressed, here and there, the situation that we're living through. I'd never done that before and I guess because I've been so alarmed, so distraught, the pressure of this unhappiness has spilled over into my work at times.</p> <p>If <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">McCain</a> wins, I feel like going into a cellar for the next four years or going out in the streets every day and screaming. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Obama</a>, if he does win, is going to have so many problems to deal with that the most one could hope for would be to undo some of the damage. Most artists seem to be for Obama. In fact, I haven't met a single one who is for McCain, so our spirits would be lifted. The problems in the country will remain as serious as ever.</p> <p>Art isn't journalism. Some of the greatest historical novels were written long after the events discussed in the book. You think of War and Peace, written in 1870 about things that happened in 1812. I think there's this confusion in the minds of the public that artists are supposed to respond immediately to things that are going on. We've been living through a new era. Everyone knows the world has changed, but exactly where the story is taking us is unclear right now and until it plays out further I don't know if anyone has a clear vision of what's happening. </p> <h2>Joyce Carol Oates<br>Writer</h2> <p>The \"cultural legacy of George W Bush\" would seem to be the punchline of a cruel joke, if there could be anything remotely funny about the Bush administration. (There isn't: nothing funny, and nothing of a legacy.) But the National book festival, hosted each September by former librarian Laura Bush on the Mall in Washington is a truly valuable cultural event, which we can hope that the wife of George W's successor will wish to continue.</p> <p>The cultural life of America is a thing quite apart from the federal government. It can flourish, as in the Johnson-Nixon eras, as counter-culture; in times of political debasement, art can be idealistic and ahistorical. Most artists live through a sequence of administrations, and their art evolves in ways too individual to be related to larger, generic forces.</p> <p>The cultural life of America would be relatively unchanged if McCain wins, since he is a variant of Bush. If Obama wins, very likely there would be an efflorescence of a kind, perhaps most evident in the more public artforms - dance, music, theatre. </p> <p>We can hope!</p> <h2>Gore Vidal<br>Writer</h2> <p>Although all politicians tell lies, Bush has gone right round the bend as a liar and he'll be remembered for a great many of the lies, starting with weapons of mass destruction and going on and on. That's the only legacy. Oliver Stone, I gather, is doing father-and-son stories. I'm very fond of Oliver, but you don't need Freud when you're dealing with Caligula.</p> <p>One of the problems is that journalists think this is just a familiar phenomenon, this administration. It isn't - there isn't anything like it. It doesn't bode well for anything at all - it's just there. Culture goes on. People go on writing novels even though the general public doesn't want to read them. I think the plucky few will continue and to predict what the next wrinkle will be is not very useful.</p> <p>We have a president who cannot read. He's dyslexic, as was his father before him. It must have an effect. I watch a good deal of television because of the elections. The professional television people, all of them graduates of our finest universities, can't use proper English. We are losing the language, I suppose.</p> <p>Art is always needed in a country that doesn't much like it. Performance is all anybody cares about.</p> <h2>Paul Miller<br>AKA DJ Spooky</h2> <p>Under Reagan and Thatcher you had the rise of an internationalist view of music, especially with punk, reggae, and dub. The Bush administration has left a legacy of numbness - what do you rebel against when, essentially, the establishment just doesn't care what you think?</p> <p>Usually when you have a rightwing lunatic such as Nixon, or more cynical regimes such as Reagan or Bush I's administration, there's a counterpoint. What ended up happening with Bush II is that the counter-culture response became incoherent.</p> <p>The \"culture-entertainment\" industry is different now. They realise that the idea of rebellion can be made into an echo-chamber and sold back to you. We have rebellion on the radio, songs that are anti-establishment, \"mavericks\" for president, but on the other hand you have the Dixie Chicks and the reaction when they said stuff against the war. You can see that there's still a tremendous reactionary culture in the US.</p> <p>The meta-narrative is that anything goes: Britney Spears giving herself a haircut or the \"hyper-realism\" of the execution of Saddam Hussein spreading like video wildfire on people's cellphones. It's incoherence - montaged and edited a la Oliver Stone. Is the president a mirror that speaks to you? I don't think so.</p> <h2>Elizabeth LeCompte<br>Theatre director</h2> <p>He has fostered the rise of political satire as an art form again. It hasn't been very strong for the last 30 years or so and I think television programmes such as The Daily Show, The Colbert Report and South Park are all political works of art. Without the Bush administration I don't think satire would have been as strong. It revived irony. </p> <p>Theatre in America is in decline, however. A lot of the people who would have been writing for the theatre 100 years ago are now writing in television. In America, all art is denigrated, basically, with the possible exception of music. Written and spoken arts aren't taken seriously here, and I don't think they've ever been. </p> <p>People are starting to view politics as entertainment much more. That's why the number of people voting is up. YouTube has made politicians entertainers. With satire there's an incredibly powerful challenging of the powers that are, which I think is very healthy. There's also a trivialising effect at the same time. But it is a change, because young people are going to be involved in politics in a way that they haven't been before.</p> <p>When Obama had trouble, before he beat Hillary, they began to make fun of him as a pompous teacher, so let's see. I think it'll be interesting. I just know that for me, under the Bush administration, things like The Daily Show and South Park will be remembered as real satire, not just parody and caricature. </p> <h2>Edward Albee<br>Playwright</h2> <p>What cultural legacy? There is no cultural legacy. We have an administration of criminality, complicity and incompetence but no cultural legacy whatever from those eight years. It doesn't seem to have produced the kind of rage that I would have expected it to. It shows me that we have a far more passive and ignorant society than I thought we had.</p> <p>The only value the arts have is commercial. I have found over the past eight years that commerce has taken over the arts in the United States.</p> <p>I don't think that the Republican administration could have gotten away with everything that it did had it not had a complacent and compliant society. That troubles me a lot. It tells me sad things about the United States now. The only art that is allowed any great exposure is commercial art that is not going to rock the boat.</p> <p>I always have hope. Somebody asked Beckett once why he writes if he's such a pessimist. He said, \"If I were a pessimist I wouldn't write.\" I'm something of an optimist. I hope that we're capable of getting back on the right track and continuing our peaceful social revolution.</p> <h2>Alex Gibney<br>Film director</h2> <p>I think the Bush administration did its best to create a vast wasteland. At the same time, because of the perfidy and corruption and utter lawlessness it created a very interesting backlash of politically oriented materials that were inspiring. Unintentionally, the administration provoked a lot of political art that I think was very valuable.</p> <p>It contributed to an extraordinary flowering of political documentaries - and not necessarily pure anti-Bush ones. The administration provoked a thoughtfulness, both in aesthetic terms and in terms of political thinking, that expressed itself in documentaries in a very exciting way. Iraq in Fragments, for instance, was a beautiful film - not overtly political but political in a deeper sense.</p> <p>I was associated with a global series called Why Democracy? in which film-makers from all over the world looked at democracy at a time when Bush was trying to \"make the world safe for democracy\" - or to pulverise the world to accept his version of it. They were very interesting, perceptive and valuable. So the rise of new documentary in the age of Bush has been a great contribution, if unintended.</p> <p>I think under a McCain administration you'd see a renewed sense of opposition. The cultural world may get even wilder. Under an Obama administration it'll be interesting to see what happens. My fear about Obama is that he's motivated to sweep a lot of stuff under the rug, about his own administration and its ties to very high-powered financial interests. I'm getting ready to start looking at stuff and holding people to account.</p> <p>But I was joking with a friend of mine, Eugene Jarecki, who made Why We Fight, about how we'd better be honing our skills as the directors of romantic comedies, because without the Bush administration, what are political film-makers gonna do? We'll all be out of work. So please, McCain, win!</p> <h2>Lionel Shriver<br>Author</h2> <p>As Oliver Stone's film illustrates, W has been a great inspiration, a beacon on the hill, if you will, for artists in every field. Although perhaps not the kind of inspiration that the president would have wished. </p> <p>Among many other works, Michael Moore's mocking Fahrenheit 9/11, Ian McEwan's Saturday, Brian Haw's Iraq-protest-turned-Turner-prize-winner-turned-West-End-play (The State We're In), and David Hare's Stuff Happens all have a notoriously incompetent American president to thank for their success. Bush's inability to put a sentence together without repeating the same word five times and chronic mispronunciation \"nucular\" have provided a feast for comics all over the world. </p> <p>So the Bush years have been great for the arts, restoring a collusive, adversarial climate last seen circa 1968. Hate figures are far more motivating than heroes, and W has graciously provided the collectively leftwing artistic community an embarrassment of riches. In fact, the biggest problem with the Bush era's artistic legacy is that this widely despised president has tended to inspire polemics and agitprop. Many novels, films, plays, and artworks from the last eight years have been spitting with indignation, painfully obvious in their political intent, sledgehammer subtle in their execution, and clubby - since most of these works are preaching to the converted. Thus W may have bequeathed a whack of subject matter, but whether any of this stuff will be of enduring value is open to question. You have to ask yourself whether the diatribes denouncing Bush in a novel, such as JM Coetzee's Diary of a Bad Year (a book trying enough when it was published in 2007), will hold the faintest interest after January 2009.</p> <p>And here's the really bad news: Obama could be terrible for the arts. Why, when there's barely an artist in the States who doesn't support him? Art thrives on resistance. There's nothing more arid, more enervating, more stultifying, or more utterly uninspiring than getting your way. </p> <h2>Trisha Brown<br>Choreographer</h2> <p>I was given a list of people in Congress who might be open to talking about the arts. One senator asked me, \"Is this like that woman who does dance?\" turned to an assistant and said, \"Who was that person?\" He meant Martha Graham. The discussion was not bitter whatsoever, but it was frightening because I learned that these people are not thinking at all about arts.</p> <p>One Congressman said to me, \"Well, is Joe Six-Pack gonna really be interested in this?\" I said, well, we certainly have a country brim-full of great artists and maybe Joe Six-Pack has a couple of kids in the house and they might be interested in music, or painting, or dance. That was the most I could move him without getting into combat.</p> <p>I was lobbying, trying to bring them information. The other person who's memorable from that excursion said, \"Do you know who I think is the greatest artist?\" so I said, \"No, I don't know\" and he said, \"God\". I went home like a whipped puppy. I saw that there was no thought about it. My heart was broken.</p> <p>I thought young artists would go to bat sooner. There are some people who are dedicated to responding to political issues and many who are not. If you're a painter or a sculptor there's money. If you're in dance, there's very little for independent artists. It's very discouraging. I was so in love with art-making - but I'm tired of the suppression of arts and I've shifted into other disciplines to find vitality and exchange.</p> <h2>David Simon<br>TV writer/producer</h2> <p>Enron, Afghanistan, Iraq, New Orleans, Wall Street. An untenable drug war. A non-existent energy policy. An obliviousness to climate change. An unwillingness to recognise our problems, much less begin the hard work of solving them. Incompetence - rank incompetence - has become the American standard. We are no longer a competent, responsible nation-state. America. The can't-do superpower. Quite a legacy. Mr Bush is a remarkable man.</p> <h2>Naomi Wolf<br>Author</h2> <p>Bush's cultural legacy? It's disturbing that my initial response is to draw a blank. But it's a sign of the fact that the past eight years have simply pushed the arts to an underground place. It's not just that [Bush] didn't fund the arts or invite artists to the White House; it's not just that he doesn't read poetry, doesn't read books: there's something about the brute force of this administration, and the fetishisation of brute force by this administration, which literally stands in opposition to civilisation and the arts. </p> <p>I've done a lot of work on Germany from the Weimar period to the late 30s. There was a similar hostility then to the cosmopolitan, the urbanite, the avant garde, to any originality in art. Some of the most interesting visual artists we've seen in recent times, for example, were working behind the iron curtain, and of course, they had to work allegorically.</p> <p>Much of the protest work I've seen [in America] has been very bad, pedantic, heavy-handed. I've seen so many bad monologues about the Iraq war, so many dreadful photo-montages. I think it's because Americans don't quite understand repression yet. They're not yet understanding the nature of the force that has come down on them, by drawing on their subconscious, by expressing themselves in an allegorical way. And I think artists in America are scared. Respected journalists are being arrested. Film documenting the Republican national congress has been destroyed. And artists are next on the list after journalists. So if, God forbid, there's a McCain/Palin presidency we'll see a crackdown of the police state, there's no doubt. </p> <p>I'm really quite ashamed of the American people - and of course I include myself in this. We have seen what was happening, and we kept right on internet shopping. All these writers and artists, good people, have just looked around and quietly aligned themselves. Novelists have been really silent. Usually writers are at the forefront of denouncing a regime: look at V\u00e1clav Havel. Here, people have complained a lot, but in terms of organising a vanguard of resistance, of people getting out there and saying this is not the American way ... Where is the Arthur Miller of this generation? Who is out front, somewhere visible and tricky and scary? </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The End of America</strong>, a documentary based on Naomi Wolf's book of the same name, has its UK premiere on November 7 at the Sheffield Doc/Fest </p> <h2>Daniel Libeskind<br>Architect </h2> <p>How can you even begin to speak of a cultural legacy? It's been wholly negative. Culture's a dirty word to these people, like \"liberal\" or \"literate\". We've experienced a complete bankruptcy of the culture of ideas over the past eight years. The intellect has been denigrated. Deep cuts have been made in education and in investment in cultural institutions.</p> <p>At Ground Zero, we're not sure if the performing arts centre planned will ever happen. This was a key part of the masterplan, but all that's mattered in the World of Bush is the workings, and failures, of the market economy. So, Ground Zero could yet end up, unless we get a sympathetic new president, as a purely commercial venture, with a memorial, rather than as a springboard for American culture.</p> <p>It's hard to believe Bush, a man who's proud not to read books and who makes fun of words longer than one syllable, has been the inheritor of the mantle of the Founding Fathers, or of Woodrow Wilson, FDR or even Bill Clinton. These people believed in the value of American culture being seen as an inspiring and civilising force around the world. Jefferson was a fine architect. All Bush has offered the world is military force. This is still a great country, but Bush and Cheney have ensured that only the negative side of US culture has spread around the world.</p> <p>\u2022 Interviews by <strong>Andrew Purcell</strong>, <strong>Jon Henley</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Glancey</strong></p>",
  "<p>A leader item said that the firestorm in the German city of Dresden in the second world war killed up to 150,000 people.

  "<p>Defiance, a picture postcard town in north-west <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ohio\">Ohio</a>, takes its name from a fort built here in 1794 by a General \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne. The general was so proud of his deep moat and the fort's 2.5-metre-thick walls that he declared, according to local lore: \"I defy the English, the Indians and all the devils in hell to take it.\"</p> <p>So it was easy to see why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>, the Republican presidential candidate, found Defiance an irresistible place to launch his final <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselections2008\">battle for the White House</a> yesterday with a two-day bus tour of Ohio.</p> <p>Outgunned in the polls and on TV by his Democratic opponent, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>, and deserted by some of his fellow Republicans, McCain had little reassurance to offer his supporters yesterday except his defiance - and a little lesson in his own history.</p> <p>McCain cannot hope to match Obama in advertising spending, especially his half-hour broadcast on Wednesday night that the Democrat reportedly paid three television networks more than $1m (\u00a3600,000) each to air. </p> <p><strong>Battle bus</strong></p> <p>The bus tour for McCain was heavy with its own symbolism. Nearly a year ago now, the senator for Arizona made an improbable comeback to win the Republican nomination by driving around New Hampshire aboard his \"Straight Talk Express\" bus.</p> <p>He struck a similar can-do pose in Defiance town. \"We're a few points down, but we are coming back,\" he said. \"We are never giving up. We are never going to quit.\"</p> <p>But for all the fighting talk and carefully chosen symbols of defiance, it was a visibly wilting McCain who rode into town on a brilliant autumn morning to address a crowd of several thousand in front of the local middle school.</p> <p>In recent days, his campaign has had a number of embarrassing leaks about feuding and recrimination between his staff and his running mate, Sarah Palin - the sure-fire sign of a losing team.</p> <p>McCain has had to watch as associates from his decades in Washington turn their back on him to endorse Obama, most notably Colin Powell, the former secretary of state.</p> <p>McCain has also had to confront the idea that many Republican candidates for Congress find him politically toxic and do not want him campaigning in their area.</p> <p>Unlike in Florida last Thursday, where he was flanked by the state's governor, Charlie Crist, and the former governor Jeb Bush, McCain had no comparable state notables with him in Defiance.</p> <p>Ohio's Republican senator, George Voinovich, has yet to appear with McCain or his running mate, Sarah Palin, at a single event in the state - even though with its 20 electoral college votes, it is one of the richest prizes in this campaign.</p> <p>No candidate has taken the White House without winning Ohio since John Kennedy in 1960, and McCain is a few points behind Obama in the polls.</p> <p>He trails Obama even further in organisation, especially the early voting which campaigns see as a safety blanket against bad weather that could stop their supporters getting to the polls on election day.</p> <p>According to Ohio election officials, 62% of early voters in the state have been Democrats, and 37% Republicans.</p> <p>McCain faced another apparent desertion yesterday, this time from Joe the Plumber, the Ohio man who became a Republican celebrity after confronting Obama about taxes at a campaign stop three weeks ago.</p> <p>Since then, Joe the Plumber, whose real name is Samuel Wurzelbacher, has emerged as an increasingly important prop in McCain's stump speeches. McCain has even started billing his events as Joe the Plumber rallies in Wurzelbacher's honour.</p> <p>Only, as it turned out yesterday, McCain could not count on him either.</p> <p>\"Joe is with us today,\" McCain told the crowd. \"Joe, where are you? Where is Joe? Is Joe here with us today?\"</p> <p>Wurzelbacher has campaigned for McCain this week. His moment of celebrity has also led to a recording contract offer, local television reported yesterday. But if Wurzelbacher was in Defiance he gave no sign of it.</p> <p>\"Joe, I thought you were with us today,\" McCain continued, somewhat plaintively. \"All right. So you are all Joe the Plumbers,\" he told the crowd, before making one last attempt. </p> <p>He told Wurzelbacher he had seen him on television that morning: \"Wherever you are Joe, I thought you did a good job,\" said McCain.</p> <p>Such confusion has been the running thread through the campaign in these final days. Some is no doubt due to fatigue. At one point yesterday, McCain lost his place on the teleprompter, asking aloud: \"Where am I?\"</p> <p>But he has also been lurching from theme to theme with rising desperation. In Ohio yesterday, he warned that Obama would raise taxes, which would cost people their jobs. In Florida, he warned that Obama would bring socialism and negotiate with dictators.</p> <p><strong>Tarnished image</strong></p> <p>Meanwhile, campaign officials have been trying to stoke a new controversy about Obama's associations in Chicago by harping on about a dinner he had with a noted Palestinian academic, Rashid Khalidi.</p> <p>Such abrupt changes of direction and the negative tone of the campaign have had commentators - including conservatives - accusing McCain of tarnishing his own brand of an independent politician.</p> <p>Yesterday David Broder, the veteran political commentator at the Washington Post, wrote that though McCain had been burdened with George Bush's unpopularity he had failed to create a coherent vision for his campaign.</p> <p>For the hardcore of McCain's supporters, like the people at yesterday's rally, it is too soon to try to dissect the reasons he has been losing ground to Obama - or even for some to acknowledge it.</p> <p>At the last, McCain is making his underdog status part of his appeal to voters. The crowds he addresses are booing Obama louder, which they do regularly, than cheering McCain. His rallies play the theme song from Rocky - conveniently overlooking the fact that the scrappy fighter played by Sylvester Stallone lost to Apollo Creed.</p> <p>To his supporters it matters little. It will all come down to the wire, they say.</p> <p>\"It's going to be a tight race. All the polls seem to indicate that Obama has got the lead, and it's all wrapped up, but I don't believe it,\" said Mike Saxton, a retired science teacher. \"Obama's still having a tough time sealing the deal.\"</p> <p>Beside him, Bob Morton, a school principal, agreed. \"Every presidential election closes up at the end,\" he said. \"This one could too.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Saturday November 1 2008. A quote was slightly garbled and attributed to the wrong person. Senator Lindsey Graham, rather than John McCain, said: \"Anybody see the infomercial last night? Thank God for cable! If we had played that at a prison camp it would have violated the Geneva convention.\" This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Despite running one of the worst presidential campaigns I've ever seen, John McCain would, I'm convinced, make an excellent president. Among America's friends and allies there is an almost unshakable conviction that only an Obama presidency can undo the damage done by President Bush's supposed foreign policy blunders. And I can understand that - Obama's personal story is inspiring; he is an unusually thoughtful person with a cool temperament and a commanding presence. But, hard though this may be to believe, this is precisely the right moment for President McCain. </p> <p>The past seven years have been a time of extraordinary tumult in international affairs, and the world badly needs a period of consolidation and sweeping reform. Our diplomatic and economic institutions are ill suited to tackling the diffuse threats posed by climate change, financial contagion, mass epidemics and catastrophic terrorism. Only Nixon could go to China, and only McCain can reconcile conservatives to some of the hard steps the US will have to take.</p> <p>When John McCain first ran for president in 2000, he promised to remake the Republican party in his own idiosyncratic image. Just as Ronald Reagan expanded the party to embrace southern evangelicals and western libertarians, McCain appealed to suburban independents who rejected ideological cliches in favour of pragmatic problem-solving. Republican governors and mayors had worked for years with Clinton's White House to reform and revamp failing public institutions. </p> <p>There was a new centre in US politics, and McCain captured its reformist spirit. He rejected the strident moralism of the sectarian right in favour of a more inclusive conservatism built on the idea of shared sacrifice and public service. Having worked with John Kerry to repair America's relations with Vietnam, he aimed to end the country's culture war, in his view the most tragic legacy of the war in which he had served. Indeed, McCain's reluctance to play the culture war card may have cost him the Republican nomination that year.</p> <p>Yet now, McCain has become a captive of that same culture war. His running mate, Sarah Palin, has proved an enthusiastic culture warrior, going so far as to call big US cities something other than the \"real America\". Those cities are the engines of America's creativity and prosperity, and home to millions of suburban independents who once looked to McCain as their champion.</p> <p>We haven't seen the real McCain in this campaign. During Bush's first term in office, McCain served as a kind of leader of the opposition. Because the Democrats were so weak and divided, McCain became a rallying point for conservatives and liberals who opposed Bush on issues ranging from taxes and spending to the conduct of the war on terrorism. Some leading liberal thinkers called on him to switch parties and run against Bush as a Democrat. John Kerry wanted McCain as his running mate. But in 2004 McCain made the fateful, and in retrospect perhaps foolish, decision to back Bush, all in the hopes of bearing the Republicans' tarnished standard.</p> <p>Now, in the last days of the campaign, he must find his voice, and make it clear that he's not in the race out of personal ambition - indeed, he would be well advised to make a one-term pledge. Rather than win the election for a party or faction, he must promise to work with all parties and all talents to build a safer, more prosperous world. It's hard to imagine such an appeal overcoming Obama's overwhelming financial advantage or the many mistakes the McCain campaign has made in the past months - but it would be an appeal McCain, and all Americans, could be proud of.</p> <p>\u2022 Reihan Salam is an editor at the Atlantic and a fellow at the New America Foundation</p>",
  "<p>Mike Soper, the man Giles Clarke beat to become chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board last year, says he has been \"shocked\" and \"saddened\" by the Stanford Series in Antigua and may make a fresh challenge for the top job at Lord's.</p> <p>\"What has happened in the past few days has not only debased the game, it could kill it too. I'm frightened,\" said the former chairman of Surrey, who will become their president next year. \"It was obscene enough what went on in India. This is doing nothing whatsoever for the game as a whole, and even billionaires like Stanford can get into trouble in the current financial climate.</p> <p>\"When Kerry Packer came along 30 years ago the integrity of cricket was retained, but there will be no spirit of the game in Antigua on Saturday night. It will be a winners-take-all freak show.</p> <p>\"What is going on is demeaning and undermining the game. Kevin Pietersen and the players are obviously embarrassed to be out there. They just want to get the week out of the way. But I would take more notice of them if they all said they were going to give half their money to, say, the Chance to Shine project or youth cricket.\"</p> <p>Turning his fire on Clarke, he added: \"I was very disappointed to see the gentleman from the ECB running across Lord's to embrace Stanford and his millions last summer. I was appalled. It looked bizarre. I don't know Giles Clarke particularly well but I have not been impressed by what I have seen. We don't want some loose cannon flying round the world shooting from the hip. It's a titular role, about flesh-pressing. The tail shouldn't be wagging the dog.</p> <p>\"He is a businessman, and obviously a good one, but cricket is a great sport which can be almost spiritual in my view. It's certainly not something that can be measured only in pounds, shillings and pence.\"</p> <p>Clarke comes up for re-election in March and Soper added: \"It's unlikely I would stand next year. I'm looking forward to the presidency of Surrey. But if he stays in power I may put up against him again. One county chairman - and there are others who feel the same way - phoned me and said he hoped Clarke gets back in in March because then he can come a complete cropper instead of half a cropper.\"</p> <p>Clarke was on a plane to Antigua last night and could not be contacted.</p> <p>It is not only the Stanford Series but Twenty20 cricket in general which concerns Soper. \"It was always my view that Twenty20 cricket should never have gone international,\" he added. \"It should always have been a domestic, feeder competition to get people interested in the 40- and 50-over game and ultimately Test cricket. But now the search for instant money is not only debasing the game, it could destroy it as well. It can't last and I just hope the new game doesn't take Test cricket with it. It's ridiculous.</p> <p>\"What will happen next year if there is no sponsorship for the Twenty20 game? Who will fill the gaping hole? There should have been only one domestic Twenty20 tournament, yet in 2010 there will be two. Who's going to watch the game six times in four weeks? This year was the first without [spectator] growth and that could get worse. If people think the game will feed on its own success they are wrong.\"</p> <p>Soper, 62, was favourite to beat Clarke last year. They tied 9-9 in the first vote of the 18 counties and the MCC but Clarke won on the second ballot 12-6.</p> <h2>What the ECB agreed</h2> <p><strong>Stanford 20/20 for 20</strong></p> <p>The ECB and Stanford agreed a five-year \u00a350m deal whereby England will play an annual winners-take-all Twenty20 match in the Caribbean against the Stanford All-Stars. The winning players will each pocket $1m, the four other squad members a share of $1m and the ECB $3.5m.</p> <p><strong>Stanford Quadrangular</strong></p> <p>To be held in England every year until 2012. The inaugural event will be held at Lord's before the World Twenty20 Championship in June. The format is two semi-finals and a final.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and John McCain are embarking on a frenzied, multi-state blitz over the final days of the election campaign as the Republican candidate claimed the polls are tightening in his favour.</p> <p>His campaign manager, Rick Davis, told reporters during a conference call yesterday: \"We're still fighting; we're still behind; we still think we've got plenty of time to close the gap enough to make this election competitive and win it.\"</p> <p>The McCain team drew comfort from some polls showing Obama's lead over the last month had started to shrink, albeit marginally. \"There's no question there's a closing in this campaign,\" Davis said.</p> <p>RealClearPolitics, a poll-monitoring website, showed Obama averaging 50% nationwide to McCain's 43%. But the race is tight in battleground states such as Florida, where Obama has just a 3% lead.</p> <p>Davis claimed McCain was \"coming back\" among suburban males and Hispanics, a view conceded by Democratic workers on the ground, who contrast the huge turnout for Obama among African-Americans with a more ambivalent response among Hispanics.</p> <p>In spite of Davis's optimism, the momentum still appears to be with Obama. Viewing figures for his 30-minute political broadcast on Wednesday, for which he paid three networks an estimated $1m (\u00a3600,000) each, show about one in five US households tuned in. That is high for a political broadcast, but fewer than for the presidential debates, all three of which attracted more than 30% of viewers.</p> <p>At a rally in Sarasota, Florida, yesterday Obama warned supporters: \"Don't believe for a second this election is over. Don't think for a minute that power concedes. We have to work like our future depends on it in this last week, because it does.\" </p> <p>A poll released yesterday by the University of Texas showed that 23% of Texans identified the Democrat, whose Christian faith has been widely publicised, as a Muslim. Given that Texas is solidly Republican, that will not cause Obama any concern. </p> <p>Potentially more alarming for Obama is a detailed analysis in the Orlando Sentinel of early voting in Florida. While it shows a huge turnout among African-Americans, young voters on whom Obama is placing high hopes have yet to vote. Although the young have registered to vote in high numbers, only 15% of those under 35 have voted so far, the worst-performing demographic group in the analysis. </p> <p>If this trend were to be repeated on election day throughout the US, Obama's vote would be seriously dented.</p>",
  "<p>America's 2008 election has at last come down to a national conversation about Barack Obama. When it began, 20 months ago, this was an election about George Bush, Iraq and Katrina. More recently it has become a contest about economic decline and insecurity, which explains more than anything why both Obama and his party have drawn steadily ahead over the past eight weeks. Now, having essentially decided which political offer to accept, Americans must go to the polls on Tuesday and sign off on the man himself.</p> <p>That is why the argument this week, and now over the final weekend, has morphed near the end into a contest over Obama himself. Bill Clinton, as ever, posed the key question when he appeared with Obama in Florida this week. \"Are you ready,\" he asked, \"for a new president?\" The Obama campaign understands this, too, just as it has understood most other things along the 2008 trail. Wednesday's unprecedented 30-minute TV election advertisement boiled down to a simple message, aimed unerringly at independents and middle-ground voters. It's OK to elect this man, it told them. It's the right thing to do.</p> <p>The Republicans understand this. The final days are about Obama for them, too. It is why the McCain campaign has again turned so negative as election day nears, trying to make the Chicago-based Palestinian Rashid Khalidi into the new Jeremiah Wright or the new Bill Ayers. It is why McCain's stump speech accuses Obama of being \"redistributionist-in-chief\" and why supporters waved placards this week saying \"Stop socialism. Vote McCain\". It is why Sarah Palin, running hard with a ball that Hillary Clinton passed to the Republicans months ago, has spent the last week pitching to what she none too subtly calls \"real Americans\", \"patriotic Americans\" or \"pro-Americans\".</p> <p>But what does it mean to say that, between now and election day, it is all at last about Obama? Travel through the US this week (as I have been doing in a series of nightly discussions on the west coast for Guardian America and the New York Review of Books), and it is impossible not to be profoundly aware that this country stands on the threshold of something that once seemed impossible. And yet when, a week from now, we reflect on the immense fact that America has elected a black president, or even if we are reflecting on the scarcely less immense fact that it has not, it will be important to remember what it feels like now - that this campaign has not fundamentally been about race at all.</p> <p>Don't get this wrong. The Republicans are engaged in an \"othering\" of Obama into which race is inextricably woven. But the othering of 2008 is not something new and unique but something old and familiar. In 2004 they othered John Kerry as a rich liberal. In 2000 they othered Al Gore as a beltway geek. In the 1990s they othered Bill Clinton as a draft-dodging child of the 60s. Before that they othered Michael Dukakis, Jimmy Carter and George McGovern, each in his turn, right back to the othering of John Kennedy as a Catholic in 1960. Othering, in other words, is what Republicans - and sometimes even Democrats - do.</p> <p>But this othering is more diabolically potent this time because it's about race, right? No, actually, that's wrong. The assumption that an inner racist demon lurks latent and uncontrollable in the souls of all white Americans, waiting to jump to the Republican dog whistle, is simply untrue. Europeans, so easily prone to condescension when talking about Americans, should not throw stones from inside their glass houses. Nor should journalists, who too often use the lazy cliche that, in the privacy of the polling booth, white Americans will do the opposite of what they say they will do.</p> <p>Barack Obama is not the black candidate. He is the Democratic candidate. He is not just the representative of an ethnic group that has never even been close to winning the presidency. He is also the nominee of a party that has become something of an expert at losing it. That is the reason why, next Tuesday, American voters face a double choice - electing a president of a race they have not previously voted for; and, at least as important on the day, electing a president from a party that, in modern times, they rarely vote in.</p> <p>Look at it this way. Obama may or may not have a problem getting white Americans to vote for him. But he is doing much better than most of his recent Democratic predecessors ever managed among such voters. In 2004, white Americans split 58% for Bush and 41% for Kerry. Four years before that, they went 54% to Bush and 42% to Gore. In 1992 Bill Clinton had a two-point lead among white people. Four years before that, George Bush Sr beat Dukakis by 20 points. Against that historical backcloth, Obama's one-point lead over McCain among white voters in the most recent New York Times-CBS poll looks pretty significant, while his bigger leads among white women, white men under 45 and, especially, white independent voters look potentially like a set of decisive turnabouts from recent Democratic experience.</p> <p>In fact, if you are looking for one theme from late 20th-century elections that marked American contests out from western European ones, it was not the politics of race but the politics of gender. For much of the past century in most European industrial nations including Britain, men tended to vote to the left of women, though that has begun to change recently. In the US, by contrast, women have in recent decades tended consistently to vote to the left of men. That certainly makes white men - who are around one in three of all adults - a key group of voters next week. But the fact that Obama is polling more or less even with McCain among them looks like a strength, not a weakness.</p> <p>Yes, there is a lot of evidence from things like implicit association tests that racist assumptions still lurk in millions of white American minds (and European minds too, of course). But that doesn't mean that racism is the only thing you need to know about such people, or that it dominates their minds, or that they are incapable of overcoming it. In particular, it doesn't mean that, when asked to vote for this black man at this time, they will not do so. Americans have spent a long time getting to know Barack Obama. The evidence is that they like what they see, and that they are about to do something both right and great.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday November 7 2008 to correct information about how white people voted in the previous five US presidential elections.

In addition, Rashid Khalidi's name was misspelled as Khalili. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>I'm barely in my seat before Josh Brolin is reeling off the reasons why he almost said no to playing George Bush. First off, he is no fan of the sitting president. Second, he was wary of working with director Oliver Stone, who has a reputation as a loose cannon, \"a leftist hammer\". And if that weren't enough, he had to listen to Stone's constant, clamouring insistence that Brolin actually had more in common with Bush than he cared to admit. \"Oliver kept talking about the similarities between Bush and I, which really pissed me off. I don't see them,\" says Brolin. \"I don't understand it.\"</p> <p>But let's look at the evidence. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126059/w\">W</a> tells the tale of a reckless, feckless playboy who follows his dad into the family business, makes an ass of himself for a decade or two and then abruptly turns his life around on his 40th birthday. He is played by the eldest son of Hollywood main-stay James Brolin. Junior spent 20 years spinning his wheels in largely unremarkable movies before ascending to the A-list. By a happy chance, Josh Brolin turned 40 just weeks after signing on the dotted line.</p> <p>There's no denying he's earned his spurs. In person, Brolin looks every inch the movie star; a toned, rangy alpha male who parries questions with an easy drawl that is one part good ole boy, one part stoner. And yet on screen there can be something low-key - even anonymous - about him. You might have caught him in his film debut as a teenage jock in The Goonies, or as the gay cop who licks Patricia Arquette's armpit in Flirting With Disaster. More likely you first clocked him in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/118400/no.country.for.old.men\">No Country for Old Men</a>, although even here his character was so deeply embedded in the warp and woof of the film that it was easy to overlook in favour of Javier Bardem or Tommy Lee Jones. \"Yeah,\" he says when I mention this. \"But that's a compliment in a roundabout way.\"</p> <p>W is different. Brolin's performance is a showstopper, a firework display. It catches Bush's hesitant vocal rhythms and fidgety physical tics with an accuracy that is rather eerie. Judged as a film, Stone's movie is a bit of a Horlicks. Viewed as an acting masterclass, it's endlessly entertaining. Brolin's co-stars include Richard Dreyfuss as an implacable Dick Cheney, Scott Glenn as Donald Rumsfeld and Thandie Newton as the Uriah Heep-ish Condoleezza Rice. At one stage our merry band get hopelessly lost on the dirt tracks of Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, while plotting the war on Iraq. </p> <p>I suggest that Bush is something of a construct himself - an east coast aristocrat playing the part of the Texas cowboy. But Brolin is having none of it. \"No,\" he says. \"He really is that guy. He didn't grow up in the east, he grew up in Texas. That's where his roots are, and I do think his intentions are pure. I think he's surrounded by, you know, very, very ... I don't want to say evil.\"</p> <p>Oh go on - say evil.</p> <p>\"I don't want to say evil, even though I just said it. Let's just say that they are people with massive agendas. But I don't think this was the impact that he initially wanted to have on the world. I think he wanted to have a positive effect.\"</p> <p>Against the odds, he found himself admiring certain aspects of Bush's personality: the way he battled his demons, the way he treats his family. Maybe that's a hazard of the job. Maybe the longer you spend in someone's skin, the more you come to identify with him. Or perhaps Stone is right when he says that there has always been a bit of Bush in Brolin and that the actor \"no doubt shared many of the crises George W Bush found himself up against\".</p> <p>Brolin pulls a face. \"Well, it sounds good, doesn't it? I don't know, maybe I'm completely denying it. Maybe Oliver knows me better than I know myself. My dad is an actor and I'm an actor. So yes, I guess there's a cosmetic parallel. My dad's more placid than I am - there's another. My mother's very strong, or was very strong [she died in 1995] - another similarity. What else? I grew up on a ranch, he grew up in Midland, Texas. He grew up around oil; I didn't.\" He throws up his hands. \"I don't know man, I'm running dry here.\"</p> <p>W filmed for two months in Shreveport, Louisiana, a conservative bulwark that did not take kindly to an influx of wealthy, liberal movie stars. On the last day of filming, Brolin and fellow actor Jeffrey Wright (aka Colin Powell) were arrested following an altercation at the local Stray Cat Bar. Wright was reportedly Tasered in the street, while Brolin found himself doused with pepper spray.</p> <p>The actor explains that all this was the result of a verbal altercation, not a physical one. \"But when you're in a place like that, it's about them wanting to teach a lesson to the Hollywood 'poof squad', and it snowballed like nothing I've ever seen. There was incredible violence in reaction to zero violence. When I was in jail I could only think about what the average person has to go through - the person who has no power to go to the press or no money to hire a lawyer.\"</p> <p>Was he scared? \"Well, it's a scary prospect. When it started escalating I thought, 'Is this the night when I get tasered and have a heart attack?' But I was more confused than scared. Confused and befuddled. I was looking around in total shock. Or I was trying to - I had Mace in my eyes at the time.\"</p> <p>When the story was reported, it initially seemed to support the perception of Brolin as a hellraising Hollywood brat. And while I have no idea whether this impression has ever had any basis, it's hard not to return to those fictional parallels. Stone's film implies that Bush squandered his youth on wild living and then fell arse-backwards into politics because it provided the easiest option. Did Brolin - the son of the man who starred in Westworld and The Amityville Horror - do the same thing with acting?</p> <p>He shoots me a withering look. \"How do you fall into acting? It doesn't happen. I was pursuing it in a major way.\" He shrugs. \"People assume it's some nepotistic thing. If my father owned a studio then maybe he could get me work. But my father's just like me, looking for the next job. The difference is that he got it right off the bat. </p> <p>He got very famous, very young, but I was knocking around for 25 years before anyone gave two shits about me.\"</p> <p>So what changed? Brolin freely admits he has made some bad movies in his time. But he was happy to wait. He rustled up rewarding roles in theatre and eased his incipient financial pressures by trading on the stock market. These days he even runs a website called <a href=\"http://www.marketprobability.com\">marketprobability.com</a> that offers five- to 10-day \"stock baskets\" based on historical trends and the current state of the market. </p> <p>He's not trading at the moment, he says. Times are tough. Even so, he estimates that he still makes more money from stocks than he does from acting.</p> <p>\"I like to do it,\" he explains. \"It enables me to offset movies that I might other-wise have had to do for the money. Plus it stopped me gambling. I used to go to Vegas and play the horses, and then I realised how ridiculous that was. There is no winning in gambling, but there is on the stock market. Maybe it's not trillions of dollars. Maybe it's just five bucks for lunch. Who cares, it's all good.\" </p> <p>In the wake of the 2000 election fiasco, George Bush hurried to claim victory, taking to the stage to boast that they (the great, anonymous They) had always \"misunderestimated\" him. They might have misunderestimated Josh Brolin, too. Certainly he has always been a better actor than he was given credit for - yet only now is he getting the chance to prove it. </p> <p>\"You know, that's the funny thing about Josh,\" says British actor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/31/toby-jones\">Toby Jones</a>, who plays Karl Rove in the film. \"It was such a difficult and demanding role, playing Bush, and yet I was impressed by how lightly it sat on him. When you get to a certain age you are able to get a sense of perspective on the whole business of making a film. I think this came at the right time for him.\" </p> <p>Brolin would go along with that. If success had struck any earlier, he says, he wouldn't have been able to handle it. Now it's different. His three kids are almost grown up, and he is happily settled with the actor Diane Lane. He has known triumph and flirted with disaster and he has learned to treat them just the same. \"I hope I can respect the moment,\" he says. \"I've been given an amazing opportunity and I could not be more grateful. But I also know that all this will eventually die off. It's not real. It will go away and then you'll go away and then, I don't know, I'll be left sitting in some English hotel room.\"</p> <p>In the meantime, here we are. \"Yeah, I know why you're here, man,\" he says, laughing. \"This is a fun story for you guys in the media, because it's like a discovery. The old man.\" He rolls his eyes. \"All of a sudden they care about the old man.\"</p> <p>\u2022 W is released next Fri 7</p>"
