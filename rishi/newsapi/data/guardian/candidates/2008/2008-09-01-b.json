  "<p>Barack Obama failed to achieve the poll bounce he had hoped for from last week's Democratic convention, including his prime-time speech, which was viewed by millions of Americans. A CNN poll published yesterday put him on 49% of the vote while his Republican rival, John McCain, had 48%. </p> <p>The poll, and others in recent days, show that the Democratic party's presidential nominee is where he was at the start of last week; he is up only one point from a CNN poll of seven days earlier.</p> <p>In the past candidates have achieved significant poll jumps following media exposure in convention week. Bill Clinton came out of his convention in 1992 with a 16% bounce, and Jimmy Carter was boosted by 8% in 1976.</p> <p>The surprise announcement on Friday by McCain of Sarah Palin as his presidential running mate could have reduced the impact of Obama's speech. But the lack of bounce could also reflect resistance towards him among voters. He failed to achieve any boost from his tour of the Middle East and Europe before the summer.</p> <p>Obama cancelled campaigning yesterday and today because he did not want to be seen politicking in the wake of Hurricane Gustav, and he dropped plans to stay in Milwaukee last night to return to his Chicago headquarters.</p> <p>Plans by Democratic party staff in St Paul, Minnesota, to mount an aggressive campaign to grab media attention from the Republicans were also put on hold.</p> <p>David Axelrod, Obama's chief strategist, said before the convention that he did not anticipate any bounce, while McCain's team predicted a 15% poll rise for Obama. Axelrod may have been deliberately lowering expectations while McCain's team inflated them.</p> <p>A post-election bounce is not crucial in determining elections. Some candidates who achieved big poll rises subsequently went on to lose the election. More important than the conventions will be the three presidential debates held in the run-up to the November 4 election.</p>",
  "<p>Sarah Palin yesterday came face-to-face with the hard reality of the media examination she will undergo as John McCain's running mate when she was forced to confirm that her unmarried school-age daughter was pregnant.</p> <p>The revelation immediately renewed questions about the extent to which Palin, Alaska's governor, and relatively unknown before McCain announced her as his vice-presidential choice on Friday, had been vetted.</p> <p>Palin, the vice-presidential candidate and new star of the Republican party, was in St Paul, Minnesota, yesterday to rally Republican convention delegates after being dispatched by McCain the previous night. The Republicans are trying to salvage their convention, which has been disrupted by media attention switching to Hurricane Gustav. All convention activities had been cancelled for Monday except for essential business.</p> <p>Palin, soon after her arrival, was caught up in questions about her private life. In response, the McCain campaign team issued a statement on her behalf stating that her 17-year-old unmarried daughter, Bristol, was five months pregnant. Palin, who campaigns on a Christian, anti-abortion ticket, said Bristol and her partner planned to marry: \"We're proud of Bristol's decision to have her baby and even prouder to become grandparents.\"</p> <p>The fact that her daughter is to marry and have the baby may blunt any negative reaction among the party's social conservatives worried about sex before marriage. The news could even help consolidate the image of Palin and her family as typical of the average American home.</p> <p>The emergence of details about Palin's life, partly after reporters landed at her home town, Wasilla, in Alaska, raised concerns about whether the usual vetting had been dispensed with due to McCain's impulsive choice. </p> <p>McCain's team insisted yesterday he had known about the pregnancy before offering Palin the job. A spokesman, Steve Schmidt, said the senator's view was that this was \"a private family matter\".</p> <p>Mark Salter, a McCain adviser, said the pregnancy had been announced to rebut rumours from internet bloggers that Palin's son, Trig, born in April with Down's syndrome, was a child of Bristol's.</p> <p>The appointment of Palin is intended to mark a change in strategy by McCain. Having concluded it was not enough to challenge Barack Obama over his lack of foreign experience and to push his own narrative as a Vietnam war hero, he has been hoping to appeal to the working class and lower middle class, and believes Palin has the right credentials for attracting blue-collar workers.</p> <p>With the absence from the convention of McCain and the US president, George Bush - who had been scheduled to make a prime-time speech last night at the convention but went instead to Texas to be on hand for the Hurricane Gustav emergency centre - Palin, Laura Bush and McCain's wife, Cindy, led the push to raise delegates' spirits.</p> <p>The president's wife, who was scheduled to appeal from the podium for help for hurricane victims rather than make a politically-tinged speech, acknowledged delegates' frustration over the cancelled first day of the four-day convention. \"I know they're disappointed they're not going to get to have the programme tonight, but everyone understands it, everyone is thinking about everybody all across the Gulf coast,\" she told CBS television.</p> <p>All but two hours of the conference were cancelled yesterday. A cocktail party planned for last night, named Spirits of Minneapolis, was renamed Spirits of the Gulf Coast and turned into a fundraiser event for the American Red Cross Hurricane Relief Fund.</p> <p>The Republicans are hoping to resume normal business today or at least tomorrow. As long as they can manage to have two full days of prime-time viewing, finishing as planned on Thursday night, they believe they can secure enough media attention to judge the convention a success.</p> <p>While Hurricane Gustav reminded the public of the failure of Bush to deal with the devastation of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, McCain's campaign team sought to turn the storm to their advantage. The cancellation of the first day of the convention sent out a message that McCain cared, contrasting with Bush's seeming indifference straight after Hurricane Katrina.</p> <p>McCain said on ABC News that he was frustrated at the loss of part of the convention but added: \"This is just one of those moments in history where you have to put America first.\"</p> <p>The hurricane diverted media attention from the Republican convention, with almost all of the anchor journalists from the main networks having flown out to New Orleans.McCain is hoping he can get back media attention for Palin's speech tomorrow and his own on Thursday. Rick Davis, a McCain adviser, said decisions would be taken on a day-to day-basis.</p>",
  "<p>Iraqi security forces took control of Sunni Anbar province from the US military yesterday, a milestone in moves to wind down the American presence in a key area that was an insurgent stronghold.</p> <p>Iraqi troops paraded with flags flying at a formal handover ceremony in the provincial capital Ramadi, once a byword for vicious fighting, though underlying political tensions are yet to be resolved.</p> <p>\"This war is not quite over, but it's being won and primarily by the people of Anbar,\" declared the US commander, Marine Major General John Kelly. \"Al-Qaida has not been entirely defeated in Anbar, but their end is near and they know it. What Anbar needs now, what will end this conflict and prevent al-Qaida from ever coming back, is economic development, reconstruction and funds for compensation.\"</p> <p>In Washington President George Bush praised the achievement, saying that the province had been \"transformed and reclaimed by the Iraqi people\".</p> <p>Anbar, which is mostly desert, extends from the western outskirts of Baghdad to the borders of Syria, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. It saw some of the bloodiest fighting after the 2003 invasion, including two assaults by US forces on Falluja.</p> <p>About one third of US fatalities in Iraq, 1,305 troops, have been in Anbar, more than 40% of them by improvised explosive devices.</p> <p>It is the 11th of Iraq's 18 provinces but the first majority Sunni one to be handed over to the Shia-led Baghdad government.</p> <p>US forces are to remain but in a limited \"overwatch\" role in which they will cut back on security patrols and focus on training Iraq's army and police. The US has 28,000 soldiers in Anbar, down from 37,000 in February, while the number of Iraqi soldiers and police has grown to 37,000 from 5,000 three years ago.</p> <p>The handover is expected to help the US cut troop levels in Iraq at a time when there is pressure to boost forces in Afghanistan, where violence is now worse.</p> <p>\"We would not have even imagined this in our wildest dreams three or four years ago,\" said the Iraqi national security adviser, Mowaffaq al-Rubaie. </p> <p>\"If we had said we were going to hand over security responsibility from foreign troops to civilian authority people would laugh at us.\"</p> <p>The handover had been scheduled for June but was delayed by a row between local leaders and a bomb attack in Ramadi. Anbar was the bastion of al-Qaida in Iraq and its renegade Jordanian leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who used the area as a staging-ground for attacks in Baghdad until he was killed in a 2006 US airstrike. Two years ago a US intelligence report concluded that al-Qaida had made such inroads that the war was lost in Anbar. </p> <p>The tide began to turn in late 2006, when Sunni tribal leaders alienated by al-Qaida atrocities changed sides, forming US-funded \"awakening councils\" that became a model for grassroots guard units across the country.</p> <p>Security progress after the US troop surge has not been matched by internal political reconciliation. The Iraqi parliament has yet to pass a controversial election law that has been delayed by a dispute over the oil-rich northern province of Kirkuk. </p> <p>Provincial elections - seen by both Washington and Baghdad as a key development - can be held this year only if agreement can be reached in the next two weeks.</p>",
  "<p>\"It's time to take off our Republican hats and put on our American hats,\" John McCain told his party at the weekend, which must have come as a shock to many, as ridiculous hats are the main point of US political conventions. Despite McCain's admonition, several pieces of red-white-and-blue headgear were spotted in St Paul yesterday, including two that bore the single, rousing word that inspires Republicans everywhere: not \"hope\", or \"change\", but \"drill!\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Nonetheless, the change of tone is detectable. The convention party originally called Political Chicks A Go-Go! has been turned into a sombre fundraiser. \"Tonight we will bring together our peers who are in Minnesota and make plans to respond as a community and a movement accordingly,\" the organisers announced, which doesn't sound very A Go-Go! \"The Democratic party is about making sure everybody has a good time, has drinks, has cocktail parties,\" a Republican operative at a typically low-key party explained to one journalist. \"The Republican party is about making sure everybody has a place to live. A place to be safe.\" The operative reportedly \"swayed slightly\" as he spoke. But that was presumably just because he was overcome with empathy.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The worst omen for the McCainiacs is surely that the news anchors are fleeing St Paul, bound for the hurricane zone - or, in the case of MSBNC's Keith Olbermann, returning to New York to coordinate coverage, which sounds rather like an excuse for going home early. At the Mall of America in nearby Minneapolis - America's second-biggest shopping centre, which features an integrated amusement park - there was nobody at all in the \"reporters' retreat\", a media centre set up to lure the cameras into using the mall as a backdrop for their reports. Not that the mall's shopkeepers were helping add to the convention buzz either: one store selling Republican convention merchandise felt compelled to display a sign explaining that this didn't mean the owners backed McCain. The official convention hotels, meanwhile, are greeting guests with enormous red signs reading: \"Welcome!\" - and in letters so small you have to peer closely to make them out: \"Republican National Convention\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Most people know little about McCain's running-mate, Sarah Palin: a recent USA Today poll suggested that 51% of American voters had never heard of her. Troublingly, even Palin's mother-in-law seems in the dark about her qualities. \"I'm not sure what she brings to the ticket other than she's a woman and a conservative,\" Faye Palin said. \"Well, she's a better speaker than McCain.\" Clearly, Faye missed Cindy McCain's weekend interview with ABC, in which she explained that Alaska is \"the closest part of our continent to Russia\", and that Palin \"was a member of the PTA\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Another compelling reason to rally behind John McCain in this time of crisis, rather than, say, Barack Obama: Obama will steal the food from your plate. At a restaurant in the minuscule town of Hamilton, amid the soybean fields of Indiana, local woman Luanna Gearhart stepped away from her seat for a few minutes; when she returned she was taken aback to find the Democratic candidate for president sitting in it, eating her food. \"He's eating our appetizers,\" she observed. \"But God's made it this way.\" Every time someone says something like this, a member of John McCain's campaign team dies.</p>",
  "<p>A document known as \"the al-Qaida training manual\" does not appear on the reading list for Nottingham University's politics department, as we said in a Comment piece (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/18/terrorism.civilliberties\">Britain's terror laws have left me and my family shattered</a>, page 26, August 18). </p> <p>The proportion of pupils gaining five good GCSEs, including English and maths, at Paddington Academy rose by 17 percentage points this year.

  "<p>The last of the paper cups had scarcely been swept up after the Democratic convention when American liberals got the bad news. While they had been celebrating Barack Obama's steamroller ride to the Democratic nomination their candidate's lead over his Republican rival had evaporated, leaving John McCain five points ahead in Reuters/Zogby polls. </p> <p>Meanwhile McCain's popularity in the red-state heartland took another jump with his selection of the moose-shooting ex-beauty queen, Alaskan governor Sarah Palin, as his vice-presidential running mate. The war hero and gun advocate \"hockey mom\" are obviously reaching American heartlanders: at some point the left is going to have to learn to reach the same people, especially in the swing states. And to do that they are going to have to learn to speak redneck. </p> <p>A third of Americans live in the geographic \"redneck\" south and more than 50% in the cultural south - in places with white southern Scots-Irish values such as western Pennsylvania, central Missouri and southern Illinois, eastern Connecticut, northern New Hampshire, and others never seen as southern. When you look at people in what has come to be called the red-state heartland, most of their values are traditional white Scots-Irish values.</p> <p>They hold the key to any national election, yet the liberal and alternative media never speak to, or for, them. Progressives dominate the internet, politically speaking, but use it to talk to one another in a closed, politically correct conversation that by definition excludes others, particularly rednecks. I had an editor once, an old-school shot-and-a-beer newsman, who told me: \"Joe, don't become a stenographer for the powerful, regardless of their politics or party.\" I still believe that. It's humanity and a nation we're obligated to, not political junkyism or political correctness.</p> <p>Especially political correctness that excludes millions who do not see the world in terms of social politics. For instance, if I say on National Public Radio that \"rednecks don't vote in their own interests because they are misled by the gun lobby\", liberal middle-class America agrees with me. Proof is in the sales of my book. It's been normal practice so long that we rednecks are immune to it, and have come to take a certain defiant pride in the label. </p> <p>I am an Appalachian native who grew up dirt-eating poor. Yet I have managed to live a couple of decades in the middle class as a news reporter, magazine editor and publishing executive. I know the liberal middle class is condescending to working-class redneck culture - which is insulting, but not a crime. The real crime is the way corporate conservatives lie to my people, screw us blind, kill us in wars and keep us in economic serfdom.</p> <p>The good news is that many lower working-class people are starting to figure that out. If we bothered to cover redneck culture we'd be surprised to find how many progressive rednecks, what I call leftnecks, are out there. America's media caste, however, is put off by the way these folks look and sound, and by their unpredictable opinions. It's happy to deal with the rural red-state working class as long as it remains out there somewhere in \"the heartland\", a place to be polled and surveyed by Gallup to fuel self-absorbed political punditry. </p> <p>Those in the media are granted entitlement to be the one voice, defining America to the many. And they keep that entitlement as long as they maintain false objectivity and keep working-class people politically in the dark. That is not difficult. Every daily newspaper has a business section, but none has a labour section. My European friends, this is no accident. No accident at all. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Joe Bageant is the author of Deer Hunting with Jesus.

  "<h2>The religious right</h2> <p>John McCain has taken a lot of heat for naming Sarah Palin as his running mate - having met her only once - but with one core Republican constituency, previously tepid if not outright hostile to McCain, the move has proved to be inspired. America's Christian conservatives instantly fell in love with her. </p> <p>Until last week, they were holding back their volunteer hours - and their money - from the McCain campaign. Many on the Christian right had never forgiven the candidate for a speech during his 2000 presidential run, in which he denounced some evangelical leaders as \"agents of intolerance\".</p> <p>After that, no matter how solid his anti-abortion position, McCain was never regarded as \"one of us\".</p> <p>That has all changed with his pick of Palin, who is a mission statement of Christian conservativism in human form. She's not just pro-gun, she shoots grizzly bears. She's not just anti-abortion, she has had five children, giving birth to her fifth, who has Down's syndrome, earlier this year. She supports teaching creationism alongside evolution in science classes at state schools.</p> <p>As of Sunday, $7m in donations had flowed into the McCain coffers in the 48 hours since Palin had been named, most of that cash assumed to have come from evangelicals thrilled - and amazed - to find one of their own on the Republican ticket. Some said their prayers had been answered.</p> <p>Rush Limbaugh, the enormously influential conservative talk show host, told <a href=\"http://www.Politico.com\">Politico.com</a> that Palin had electrified the religious right, who were greeting the pick as a \"home f***ing run\". He added in an email, \"Palin = Guns, Babies, Jesus,\" the holy trinity of Republican rightist politics. Limbaugh contrasted Palin's life story with Barack Obama's statement earlier in the year that some poor white voters were \"bitter\" - \"clinging\" to their faith or their guns out of fear. \"Obama just lost blue-collar, white Democratic voters in Pennsylvania and other states,\" predicted Limbaugh.</p> <p>It's worth remembering that the key to George W Bush's victory in 2004, despite a surge in Democratic support, was the mobilisation of the evangelical right. If Palin succeeds in exciting that crucial bloc - getting them to organise and to turn out on November 4 - picking Palin could prove to have been a smarter move by McCain than most have given him credit for. <br><strong>Jonathan Freedland </strong></p> <h2>The hockey moms</h2> <p>She's a mother of five. She's married to a native Yup'ik Inuit. She claims she can balance \"the BlackBerries and the breast pump\". It's fair to say there's never before been a vice-presidential candidate like Sarah Palin, and John McCain must have knelt down and thanked his lucky stars when he found her, along with her recipes for moose stew. </p> <p>But this image of a wholesome, apple pie \"hockey mom\", as she describes herself, crossed with a hearty pioneer, becomes a little cracked on closer inspection. </p> <p>Her husband, Todd, was her high school boyfriend, a four-times champion snow mobiler and a judge in this year's Miss Alaska pageant. He left his job at BP Oil earlier this year after his wife was elected governor of the state last year to avoid accusations of conflict of loyalties, but quickly returned, saying his family \"needed the money\". </p> <p>Family loyalty has caused Palin other troubles, too: she is currently facing an investigation for putting improper pressure on a safety commissioner to fire a certain state trooper who just happened to be going through a divorce with Palin's sister. After the Bushes and the Clintons, most Americans are wary of politicians who are accused of using family connections for personal or political gain.</p> <p>Her children have also attracted attention, having already inspired a Facebook group: \"What's your favourite Palin child name?\" appeared on the website mere moments after McCain announced her as his vice-presidential candidate. Trig Paxon Van Palin is currently the front runner, although the others - Track (named in honour of her mother's love of track and field events), Bristol, Willow and Piper - give it a good run for its money. In truth, American voters will probably give more attention to the fact that her oldest, Track, is in the army and about to be sent to Iraq, meaning that both Obama and McCain have chosen running mates who will have a child in the armed forces in Iraq (Joe Biden's son, Beau, is going in October).</p> <p>Her most recent pregnancy certainly got the conspiracy theorists going. When Palin told her colleagues she was soon to give birth, some months ago, they were astonished and claimed her bump was \"barely perceptible\". The internet was soon awash with rumours about Trig, now four months old, with many bloggers claiming he is actually her grandson. Yet, to scupper this rumour, Palin yesterday announced that, actually, Bristol, her 17-year-old and unmarried daughter who some suggested was Trig's mother, is five months pregnant. This means that, yes, she can't be Trig's real mother, but this will hardly be a preferable state of affairs to rightwing Republican voters. The timing is even worse as Bristol will be about to give birth when voters go to the polling station, come November.</p> <p>Ultimately, Palin comes across like a composite of various American TV characters: Bree, the uptight woman in Desperate Housewives who adopts her daughter's baby, crossed with a rootin' shootin' type from Northern Exposure - which might not be quite the everywoman image the Republican party is hoping for. <br><strong>Hadley Freeman </strong></p> <h2>Feminists</h2> <p>Take a partial view of Sarah Palin - one that omits the trifling detail of her policies and beliefs - and there is much that might appeal to feminists. Her physical strength, for instance. Speaking to Time earlier this year she said that she grew up in \"a family where gender wasn't going to be an issue ... You're out there hunting and fishing ... I knew that as a woman I could do whatever the men were doing\"; in high school she won the nickname \"Sarah Barracuda\" for her tenacity on the basketball court; more recently she has run a marathon.</p> <p>And she isn't just physically tough. Palin's rise to become the first female governor of Alaska - a feminist milestone in itself - involved taking on the state party and unseating the Republican incumbent. Then there's the way that she juggles her family life and career. While many staunchly Republican mothers of five might be expected to stay at home while their kids are growing up - and to preach this as the only acceptable option - Palin offers up a very different model. Her husband took time off to be a stay-at-home father, while she returned to work three days after having her fifth child. Not everyone will envy or even admire this, but plenty of women will empathise with someone who has a tonne on her plate and is tackling it head-on. As one of only two women who has ever run on the Republican or Democrat ticket for the US presidency, Palin should be an incredibly potent feminist symbol.</p> <p>She even calls herself a feminist - why wouldn't feminists support her? The problem is that Palin's version of feminism isn't one that many people would recognise. Most notably, she is a member of the anti-abortion organisation Feminists for Life and is so fervently against a woman's right to choose that, as Kim Gandy, president of the National Organisation for Women (the biggest feminist group in the US) has pointed out \"in a gubernatorial debate, Palin stated emphatically ... that even if her teenage daughter was impregnated by a rapist, she would 'choose life' - meaning apparently that she would not permit her daughter to have an abortion.\" Such views, says feminist writer Jessica Valenti, make Palin \"a terrible choice for women. I don't really know what argument one could make that she's good for women - unless you think that having any woman candidate is good for us.\"</p> <p>\"The sad fact,\" Valenti continues, \"is that when it comes to the Republicans, the women who tend to get access to power are explicitly anti-feminist, and anti-women, because it's the only way that they're able to rise through the ranks. The party is strategically coughing up women who won't rock the boat, who won't rock male structures of power.\"</p> <p>Many feminists agree that Palin's appointment seems cynical - an attempt to win both the women's vote and the extreme rightwing vote by opting for a vice-presidential candidate who offers up the most ugly, antiquated Republican views in a glossy, young, female package. Thankfully, women don't seem to be falling for it - the first polls after McCain announced his pick showed that Palin was being received much more enthusiastically by men than by women - with more than half of all those women surveyed saying that she was unqualified to be president.</p> <p>As Margaret Thatcher taught British feminists, for all the positive symbolism that accompanies a woman crashing through the glass ceiling, it's all for nought if said woman isn't actually on our side. <br><strong>Kira Cochrane </strong></p> <h2>Republican women</h2> <p>Kay Bailey Hutchinson, the most senior Republican woman in the Senate, an authority on foreign policy, and an ordinarily serene and composed television prescence, was actually flustered. Asked what she thought of McCain's pick of Palin as his running mate, Hutchinston stuttered a bit. \"Well, it certainly ... it is bold,\" she settled on after a lengthy pause. \"It is a breath of fresh air. It is going to take everyone by surprise,\" she told MSNBC. </p> <p>Was Palin ready to step in as commander-in-chief, Hutchinson was asked. Hutchinson dodged: \"I think the fact that she was outside the Beltway [America's political centre] had to have been a decisive factor for John McCain.\" Hutchinson's obvious discomfort was in part a product of the fact that she, like so many Republicans, does not know Palin - and the Alaskan politician had not widely been considered in the running as a potential vice-president. </p> <p>That list of women McCain could have chosen was well established. It was headed by Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state - although she was earlier rumoured to have been considering a run for the White House herself. But Rice took herself out of the running last April. Then there were McCain's main economic advisers: the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, Carly Fiorna, who has been a constant presence on television during his campaign and the founder of eBay, Meg Whitman. Among Republican women in the Senate, Hutchinson and Olympia Snowe were seen as the most likely contenders. The White House Project, which supports women in politics, put both senators on its shortlist of potential presidential candidates.</p> <p>Hutchinson, 65 and a Texan, is the most senior Republican woman in the Senate. She is a solid conservative, but she supports abortion rights - which would have disqualified her among the evangelicals McCain is trying to win over. Hutchinson is also one of Hillary Clinton's best friends in the Senate. Clinton hosted a baby shower for Hutchinson when she adopted twins. Snowe, 61, who is from Maine, campaigned for McCain in neighbouring New Hampshire. She is one of the most popular figures in the Senate. She is ordinarily hawkish, but not conservative enough for the Republican right. She is a member of Republicans for Choice, which supports abortion rights, and supports stem cell research and gay rights. If there is a backlash among Republican women for choosing Palin over more experienced candidates, it is likely to be offset by the enthusiasm for her candidacy among evangelical voters. <br><strong>Suzanne Goldenberg </strong></p> <h2>Non-Alaskans</h2> <p>To most Americans the strangest thing about Palin is the state she calls home: Alaska. There is a much-viewed YouTube video of Palin handling an automatic rifle during a trip to Kuwait. As Palin looses off a few rounds, a US Army instructor can be heard telling her approvingly: \"You're pretty much hitting it dead centre.\" But her handiness with a gun shouldn't be a surprise - Palin and her father would regularly rise at 3am to go hunting: \"I grew up hunting and fishing in Alaska, and I am proud to raise my children with this same uniquely Alaskan heritage.\"</p> <p>In Alaska, where Palin grew up after her family moved from Idaho, that isn't seen as unusual. And neither is Palin's lifetime membership of the National Rifle Association, the powerful lobby group dedicated to fighting any restrictions on gun ownership.</p> <p>With its population of just 680,000 people living on the fringes of a vast wilderness, Alaska has only a little more than one person for each of its 572,000 square miles. Being separated from the US mainland, it is a place few other Americans ever visit, since it's quicker for those on America's east coast to fly to Europe.</p> <p>As a result, Alaska remains a mysterious place to Palin's compatriots. Most know that the state was bought off Russia in 1867 for $7.2m, regarded at the time as an astounding act of folly. But that was before a barrel of oil cost $100.</p> <p>Now Alaska's livelihood is sustained by oil and natural gas production - and each man, woman and child in Alaska receives an annual cheque from the state's oil royalty dividend. This year, thanks to rising oil prices, each Alaskan will receive close to $3,000 apiece.</p> <p>Naturally, Palin is a vocal supporter of drilling for oil in the protected Alaska National Wildlife Reserve, a cause of controversy inside and outside the state. Many remember that Alaska suffered the huge Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, when the tanker ran aground and released 42m litres of oil that affected 1,300 miles of Alaska's coastline.</p> <p>Palin's nomination is not the only time Alaska has figured in a US presidential election. In 1960 a candidate pledged to visit all 50 states - but his travel to Alaska took up three vital days in a nail-biting campaign. His name was Richard Nixon, and he was beaten by John F Kennedy. Sarah Palin will hope she's a better omen. <br><strong>Richard Adams</strong></p> <h2>The media</h2> <p>There are many things you can say about John McCain but one thing's for sure: the man likes to be around beauty queens. His second wife, Cindy, was the Junior Rodeo Queen of Arizona and now his chosen running mate came second in a Miss Alaska pageant and, allegedly thanks to her flute playing, won Miss Congeniality, a title heretofore associated more with an anodyne Sandra Bullock film than a highly conservative vice-presidential candidate. </p> <p>There is something strikingly familiar about Palin's appearance, but that might just be because, as American political satirist Jon Stewart was quick to point out, she looks oddly, and simultaneously, like American comedian Tina Fey, Will &amp; Grace actor Megan Mullally and a fantasy sexy librarian. </p> <p>She also evokes another comparison that American voters may well find even more comforting. When she stands next to the elder statesman McCain, the two of them look like the conventional newscasting team: the white-haired man and the pretty but sensible (never underestimate the power of a pair of glasses) younger woman. You expect them to start shuffling papers and bantering about the local baseball team any minute. </p> <p>In fact, Palin was a newscaster back in the 80s, with the big hair and earrings to match. And while there is much to snigger over in the YouTube footage of the young Palin reading out basketball scores, it does show that she has spent nearly a lifetime in front of the camera, so although she has not had an enormous amount of political experience, she certainly has media experience and, in today's climate, that might well be just as important. </p> <p>Perhaps even more problematic to the Democrats is Palin herself - the Republicans have managed to find someone with an even more extraordinary story than Obama's. As US comedian Bill Maher put it, \"How can you not love her?\" Well, some might not, but for an election-weary media and, more importantly, public, it's impossible not to be fascinated by her. <br><strong>Hadley Freeman</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 In pictures:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/sep/01/republicans2008.palin?picture=337165827\">Sarah Palin: the gun-toting governor</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday September 11 2008.

  "<p>Imagine the stink that would erupt were David Cameron to stand up in front of a dinner of rich Conservative backers and make a \u201cjoke\u201d that implied that Sarah Brown had had a lesbian affair with Jacqui Smith and produced a love child (and an ugly one to boot). Can you imagine British papers deciding to downplay the story because it was in such bad taste, allowing Cameron to carry on with his assault on Downing Street?</p> <p>Cross the pond and that is exactly what happened to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> at a fundraising dinner in Arizona a decade ago. \u201cDo you know why Chelsea Clinton is so ugly?\u201d he told a handful of big Republican funders. \u201cBecause Janet Reno is her father.\u201d</p> <p>The remark packed into its 15 words several layers of misogyny. It disparaged the looks of Chelsea, then 18 and barely out of high school; it portrayed Reno as a man at a time when she was serving as the first female US attorney general; and it implied that Hillary Clinton was engaged in a lesbian affair while the Monica Lewinsky scandal was blazing. Not bad going, Senator McCain.</p> <p>Any one of those elements would seem potentially terminal for a public figure. Yet here he is 10 years later presenting himself as a champion of feminism by appointing Sarah Palin as his running mate.</p> <p>The puzzle is explained partly by the US press, which barely reported the story. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1998/06/16/the-reliable-source/e9d2da9b-1674-4c5c-82a9-c5d167ee6ecf/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.da590cd2e92c\">The Washington Post broke</a> it in June 1998 but declined to relate the joke on the grounds it was \u201ctoo vile to repeat\u201d. Such coyness has long been ingrained in the US media, which has an annoying tendency to regard its readers as wayward children in need of moral protection. That\u2019s one important reason, incidentally, that blogs are doing so well in the US - they have no such scruples and behave in ways more akin to the British than the mainstream American media.</p> <p>Think of presidential candidate John Edwards\u2019 affair and alleged love child. The refusal of most newspapers to touch the story was ridiculed in the blogosphere for weeks before Edwards himself \u201clegitimised\u201d it by confessing.</p> <p>After his misogynist joke, McCain said sorry to Bill Clinton (though he made no direct apology to the three women involved) and the incident was all but forgotten. Should he win on November 4, his friends in the press might have some answering to do.</p>",
  "<p>Wayne Mosley, a member of the Georgia delegation to the Republican convention, surveyed the quiet main hall of the Xcel Energy Centre, in downtown St Paul, a few hours before yesterday's much-curtailed order of business began. \"I think we're probably naturally just more subdued people,\" he said. \"That doesn't mean we're any less passionate about our candidate.\"</p> <p>It was hard not to feel that he was putting a brave face on things. By most standards - not just by comparison with the Democratic convention - the auditorium seemed desolate, although it became busier as the day progressed. On the podium from which George Bush and Dick Cheney were no longer to address the audience, a handful of party operatives milled around aimlessly, now and then poking the stage with the toes of their shoes, as if to check its solidity. Behind them, on a huge plasma screen, the stars and stripes flapped silently.</p> <p>Anti-war demonstrations went ahead. But many of the roads en route to the convention centre were completely empty of people. A garish van, bearing a complicated message about abortion and the slogan \"Republicans Repent\", was parked on a back street; outside the venue, a solitary seller of red-white-and-blue hats sat on a collapsible chair with her arms folded, staring grumpily at the space where her customers ought to have been lining up.</p> <p>The Republicans' decision to scale back the opening day of their convention is not without potential advantages for the McCain campaign. The absence of Bush and Cheney spares them the awkwardness of accommodating a president who is loved and distrusted in equal measure by different wings of the party, and disdained in the US at large. It also enables McCain to portray himself as a compassionate and bipartisan candidate, rising above politics. </p> <p>Several scheduled parties in St Paul have already been changed into Hurricane Gustav fundraisers, and at a rock concert in the city on Sunday night the former Van Halen guitarist Sammy Hagar, a Republican, sought to rouse the crowd to donate, with little success.</p> <p>The few delegates inside the Xcel Centre, though, had no time for the argument that the disruption might benefit their party. \"I just don't think there's that much strategy involved in it,\" Mosley said - a sentiment shared by Randy Pullen, head of the delegation from McCain's home state of Arizona. \"Everything's just more sombre. It's clear that every delegate is concerned about what's happening in the gulf,\" he said. \"That's number one on our minds.\" Republicans simply wanted to do what was right, he said. \"If Obama can talk about Katrina, McCain can start talking about Gustav.\"</p> <p>The hall itself, though, had been almost entirely stripped of any sign of partisanship. The convention's theme, \"Country First\", appears on every part of the hall that can be seen by television cameras - though areas visible to delegates, but not the main cameras, had the enormous words \"McCain 08\", to which a maintenance team was busy adding the word \"Palin\".</p> <p>\"It's not a problem,\" said a large man who identified himself only as a friend of the rightwing talkshow host Rush Limbaugh, referring to the change of schedule. \"None of this is a problem. McCain will win, and it won't even be close. Obama's just an empty suit. The more he talks, the less people like him.\"</p> <p>Christopher Harvey, from Texas, dressed like the rest of his delegation in denim shirt and cowboy hat, seemed similarly confident. \"It's early in the convention yet,\" he said. \"Just wait.\"</p>",
  "<p>New Orleans appeared yesterday to have been narrowly spared a repeat of the devastation of Katrina three years ago when Hurricane Gustav weakened and veered to the west of the city as it made landfall. </p> <p>The hurricane was categorised down from force three to two just before it hit land near Cocodrie, a thinly populated town west of New Orleans, known for its fishing and oil industries. Dramatic television footage showed waves being forced by winds of up to 110mph over the tops of the flood defences on the west side of the city, in a worrying echo of 2005.</p> <p>Power supplies were cut to large parts of New Orleans as fallen trees struck electricity lines and flattened several homes. But sea level surges were mercifully limited to less than three metres (9ft) in some places, markedly less than the eight metres of Katrina.</p> <p>As New Orleans heaved a sigh of relief, towns to the west, such as Lafayette and Baton Rouge, remained under threat. Bobby Jindal, Louisiana's governor, warned cataclysmic flooding could still be brought by the tail end of the hurricane, which by last night had weakened to force one.</p> <p>While Gustav failed to live up to the terrifying standards set by Katrina, it still left communal and political chaos in its wake. Almost 2 million people fled the Gulf of Mexico, the largest evacuation of its kind, turning New Orleans and other coastal communities into virtual ghost towns.</p> <p>The first day of the Republican party convention in St Paul, Minnesota, was also disrupted as John McCain and his advisers struggled to find the appropriate tone. George Bush, whose handling of Katrina was criticised for being negligent and insensitive, cancelled his planned speech to the convention and travelled instead to Texas.</p> <p>At an emergency centre in Austin, Texas, he acknowledged that planning for Gustav was an improvement over the events of 2005. \"The coordination on this storm is a lot better than on - than during Katrina,\" he said. </p> <p>About 1,600 people died in Katrina . The lack of advance planning in 2005 and the sluggish federal response by the Bush administration has gone down as one of America's most shameful moments.</p> <p>By contrast federal and local governments were quick this year to put emergency plans in place. Fema, the federal emergency management agency criticised for its handling of Katrina, this time put into action a five-day plan that saw almost 90% of the region evacuated. </p> <p>New Orleans enacted a dawn-to-dusk curfew designed to prevent the looting which broke out in 2005. In further echoes of Katrina, the streets of the city were lined by heavily armed police officers.</p> <p>As the storm passes over the area, and the threat recedes, questions are likely to follow over the nature of the preparations. Ray Nagin, the mayor of New Orleans, appeared to go beyond the measured weather forecasts in encouraging the city's residents to evacuate. On Sunday night, he called Gustav the \"mother of all storms\" and warned anyone who ignored the exhortations to flee that they would be \"on their own\". \"It was absolutely the right message to send,\" he told ABC News. </p> <p>Katrina strengthened into a category 4 hurricane as it came ashore and did so towards the north and east, pushing the waves directly towards New Orleans and breaching the levees on the east of the city. Gustav swung to the north-west, putting New Orleans on the \"dirty\" side of the hurricane where rainfall is heavy but the storm surge milder. Though the waves were seen to be sloshing over the flood walls, the defences were expected to hold. \"The system is not inundated, it is not a breach. We are confident in the stability of that wall,\" said a spokeswoman of the US army corps of engineers.</p> <p>Though the levees looked likely to retain their integrity on this occasion, there are also likely to be questions once the initial crisis has passed about the pace of repairs to New Orleans' defences.</p> <p>The eastern wall, breached in 2005, has been repaired by the army corps in a rebuilding programme scheduled to last until 2012, but the western wall has yet to be reinforced because of under-funding.</p> <p>With the frequency and force of hurricanes in the region also appearing to be on the rise there is bound to be renewed soul-searching over the long-term viability of a sub-sea level city such as New Orleans.</p>",
  "<p>Anyone slightly above driving age will have realised the title of this column is a tug of the forelock to Alex Cox's <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/kurtodrome/drome.html\">Moviedrome</a> TV series - a selection of cult movies that ran on BBC2 in the late 80s and early 90s. (If you've ever watched Cox's movies, you'll know why it featured titles like A Bullet for the General, Kiss Me Deadly and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia.) Cox has just published his film-making memoirs <a href=\"http://www.ibtauris.com/display.asp?ISB=9781845115661\">X Films: True Confessions of a Radical Film-Maker</a>, and as well as offering much detailed insight into the apparently-thankless task of being an independent film director, it also motivated me to have another look at what now emerges as his rather impressive central American trilogy.</p> <p>As a film-maker, of course, Cox is rather hamstrung by the fact that his first two films - Repo Man and Sid &amp; Nancy - remain his most successful and most enduring. They are also official \"punk\" films, and like his pals the Clash, Cox found the lure of mid-80s revolutionary movements in Nicaragua, Guatemala et al impossible to resist. The 1987 film <a href=\"http://www.alexcox.com/dir_walker.htm\">Walker</a> was his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandinista!\">Sandanista!</a>, a real triple-album of a movie, starring Ed Harris as US freebooter William Walker, who invaded Nicaragua in the 1850s and set himself up as president - before being executed by firing squad in Honduras in 1860. </p> <p>It's amazingly ambitious for a Hollywood film (for Hollywood it was), and also something of a career suicide note for Cox - but he's still fantastically proud of it, describing it in his book as \"my best, my most expensive, and my least-seen film\". </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337136721\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/30/pulverwalker460.jpg\" alt=\"The Walker\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Looking at it now, it's extraordinary that a film on this subject could get off the ground on such a large scale, and since its revolutionary sentiments ran so counter to the current of the times it's hardly a surprise it was such a commercial failure. Cox's fondness for agit-prop magic realism probably didn't help, with lots of spaghetti-western-style gore and self-consciously anachronistic interpolations. But I'd urge you to dig it out again and have a look.</p> <p>For his second central American film, Cox went to the source, actually shooting in Spanish with a Mexican cast for his 1991 film <a href=\"http://www.alexcox.com/dir_highwaypatrolman.htm\">El Patrullero </a>(Highway Patrolman). I remember going to see it when it came out, and basically being a bit baffled as to what the Repo Man guy was up to - but now El Patrullero looks great, filmed with masterly long takes (a method called \"plano secuencia\" that Cox learned from Arturo Ripstein). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337136722\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/30/pulver2460.jpg\" alt=\"Highway Patrolman\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Highway Patrolman is a beautifully observed, morally intelligent film about what Cox calls \"the impossibility of imposing good on people\", and Cox found a great lead actor in Roberto Sosa - though he <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/media/rm372019200/nm0554929\">looks a bit different now</a>.</p> <p>Following that, Cox went back to Mexico in 1992 to make an adaptation of a Jorge Luis Borges story, <a href=\"http://www.alexcox.com/dir_deathandcompass.htm\">Death &amp; the Compass</a>. Originally a BBC commission, Death &amp; the Compass was a much less happy affair. Cox's book goes into detail as to exactly how it devastated him financially (as well as telling a very funny story about Alan Yentob sleeping through a personal screening); suffice to say, Cox was forced to take a despised job-for-hire to see himself through. (That film, The Winner, barely gets a sniff in X Films.) </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337136723\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/30/pulverdeathcompas460.jpg\" alt=\"Death & the Compass\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Being a paid-up entrepreneur, Cox has held on to the rights for as many of his films as possible, so the feature version of Death &amp; the Compass <a href=\"http://filmstore.bfi.org.uk/acatalog/info_144.html\">hasn't disappeared from view</a>. The most obvious thing about it is that Cox was making the most of much-reduced budgets; like all his films since, the expansive horizons of Highway Patrolman and Walker are nowhere to be found. But Cox makes up for it with creatively imagined cinematography, luridly coloured and weirdly shot - no doubt intended to complement Borges' intricate prose. Whether Borges is in fact remotely suitable for cinematic adaptation is another question entirely \u2014 lots of reviewers hated the film (Variety called it a \"wretched... bleary-eyed fever dream\"; the LA Times \"a frustrating ... exercise in tedium and pretentiousness). But if you stick with it, and perhaps gen up on the story beforehand, it's strong, impressive stuff, and is very much a forerunner, stylistically speaking, to the rather more sedate Revengers Tragedy. </p> <p>Since Death &amp; the Compass, Cox's output has become somewhat erratic, as the chill winds of film finance dictate. He used to live in Liverpool, and has since relocated to Oregon (which presumably motivated him to make the not-too-far-away Searchers 2.0). But his Latin American product has always been special; let's hope he gets back there soon.</p>",

(It's six times bigger than Britain, for God's sake!) As an experiment, after reading this, go mention this point in the comments section of a popular McCain-supporting blog, and let's see if we can't make it crop up in an anonymous quote from the campaign within the next week or two.<br></p>",
  "<p>The McCain campaign is just full of surprises!</p> <p>Today, McCain's unexpected veep pick, Alaskan governor Sarah Palin, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/02/us/politics/02PALINDAY.html\">confirmed</a> that her 17-year-old daughter Bristol is five months pregnant. In a statement, Palin and her husband said that Bristol would not terminate the pregnancy and would be marrying the father: \"Bristol and the young man she will marry are going to realise very quickly the difficulties of raising a child, which is why they will have the love and support of our entire family.\"</p> <p>The announcement was made in no small part to quell rumors that Palin's youngest son, 4-month-old Trig, was actually Bristol's and that Palin faked the pregnancy. If Bristol is five months pregnant, that's not a possibility, no matter how long and hard pictures of Sarah and Bristol Palin's midsections are scrutinised for evidence of what their wombs were up to six months ago.</p> <p>Already there is enough political hay to feed a stampede of unity ponies being made about the fact that an anti-choice (<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/01/palin-on-abortion-id-oppo_n_122924.html\">even in cases of rape</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/Palin_opposed_sexed.html\">pro-abstinence-only sex ed</a> candidate has an unmarried, pregnant, teenage daughter. Bristol's pregnancy is fair game, so goes the argument, because it shows the failure of conservative policies.</p> <p>But does it? We have no idea what the circumstances of the conception were. Maybe Bristol and her partner knew how to use contraception, had secured contraception, were using contraception \u2013 and it failed. Wouldn't be the first time. Such a scenario would hardly make Bristol's pregnancy an indictment of Sarah Palin's politics; it would merely suggest that Bristol doesn't share her mother's politics. Wouldn't be the first time for that, either. Just ask <a href=\"http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/04/14/ron_reagan/\">Ron Regan Junior</a>. There's the possibility that Bristol wanted to get pregnant and planned this pregnancy \u2013 which is a choice lots of young women make, including Barack Obama's 18-year-old mother, as he <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/obama-transcript-from-jay-newton-small/\">reminded us </a> today. The term \"pro-choice\" is robbed of all meaning if it means only defending the choices with which we agree.</p> <p>Or can't conveniently be used as a political football against a candidate we don't like.</p> <p>Using a parent's politics against a child, or a child's against a parent, has always struck me as unfair and obnoxious \u2013 and, in this case, the suggestion that Bristol Palin's decisions should be used against her mother not only ignores that we don't know the circumstances of the conception but also robs Bristol of her agency and independence, rendering this political gamesmanship both anti-choice and anti-feminist.</p> <p>Frankly, even from a strategic angle, this isn't a good issue. Everyone who disagrees with Sarah Palin's extreme abortion and sex education positions already knows that increased teen pregnancy (if not this specific teen pregnancy itself) is the inevitable result of those policies. Everyone who agrees with her positions will celebrate her daughter's decision to \"choose life\" and the family's decision to support her. And everyone who doesn't have a strong position either way will likely view this as a private family matter and regard anyone trying to politicize it as an asshole. Going after Palin on this just isn't a winner, even irrespective of the principle.</p> <p>If there's any political point to be made here at all, it is about the very real possibility that the McCain campaign did not know about this pregnancy, despite <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/seven/09012008/news/nationalnews/palin_admits_her_17_year_old_daughter_is_127025.htm\">reports to the contrary</a>. There is <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200808u/mccain-palin\">a whole lot</a> McCain evidently didn't know about Palin \u2013 and there have been <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/08/how-palin-came.html\">reports</a> that McCain chose her for the ticket after a half-assed vetting, about which even Republicans outside of DC have been grumbling. But even that is predicated on the idea that an out-of-wedlock pregnancy is so scandalous as to warrant preclusion of a related politician on a national ticket.</p> <p>And I'm pretty sure that, despite the fact it's a card the GOP would play if the shoe was on the other foot, it's the precise opposite direction from that in which we need to be heading. The low road is well-tread ground already.</p>",
  "<p>More fun with logic from the McCain campaign. Bristol Palin has decided to keep her baby; Sarah and Todd Palin point out that it was <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/PressReleases/ab547fc8-d96d-4f87-aa8a-2e52be2b66fc.htm\">\"Bristol's decision\"</a> to do so, and McCain aides are at pains to stress that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/us/international-usa-politics-palin.html?ei=5070&amp;emc=\" eta1\" \">\"Bristol Palin made the decision on her own to keep the baby,\"</a> so nobody need fear that political pressure was involved. Only, hang on a second! Neither <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/issues/95b18512-d5b6-456e-90a2-12028d71df58.htm\">John McCain</a> nor <a href=\"http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/101906/sta_20061019031.shtml\">Sarah Palin</a> believe that the law should allow Bristol Palin that choice at all. Social conservatism can be <em>so</em> confusing sometimes...<br></p>",
  "<p>Thousands of anti-war protesters marched on the site of the Republican convention in St Paul today, in an effort to force John McCain and the Republican party to confront lingering popular opposition to the US engagement in Iraq.</p> <p>The protesters were a diverse coalition of veterans of wars in Iraq and Vietnam, pink-clad feminists, shaggy-headed anarchists, a group of \"grandmothers against the war,\" and more than 130 other liberal groups. </p> <p>Although united in their opposition to the continued presence of the war in Iraq, they marched for causes as diverse as better pay for firefighters and less restrictive immigration policies.</p> <p>The Republican party staunchly supports the US presence in Iraq. John McCain, an early backer of the war and a proponent of the recent surge in US troops there, has said he will withdraw US troops only as conditions on the ground permit. Democratic nominee Barack Obama has pledged to withdraw US combat forces within 16 months.</p> <p>Under a bright clear sky, the largely peaceful protesters walked a roughly mile-and-a-half route from the state capital building to the Xcel Energy Centre, were convention proceedings are being held. The overwhelming demand, heard from speakers at the rally preceding the march and in chants along the parade route, was that the US invest the roughly $12bn per month it spends in Iraq on pressing domestic priorities like healthcare and education.</p> <p>\"There are so many things going wrong in this country, certainly the war in Iraq, but on the domestic front, healthcare is in shambles,\" said Katherine Fuchs, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. \"I really don't see how we can allow political parties to have essentially a party without raining on their parade a little bit and reminding them that all is not hunky-dory.\"</p> <p>Stefan Haire of Los Angeles said, \"We're tired of fighting a war while we are tripping over homeless people.\" He and three friends wore pastel-coloured sailor hats adorned with anti-war messages.</p> <p>The protesters beat drums, danced, and carried giant puppets and effigies of McCain, Bush, secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and former defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, one of the architects of the war in Iraq. </p> <p>The Republican party cancelled much of today's activity in order to allow its members to focus on dealing with hurricane Gustav on the Gulf of Mexico. But as the march neared the convention site, they were met by a small group of counter-protesters demanding \"let our troops win\" in Iraq.</p> <p>\"The war goes on Iraq everyday, and thousands and thousands of people made plans to be here,\" said Jess Sundin, a march organiser. \"We will bring our message to the delegates that are here today and those that are coming along later I'm sure will hear all about it. Our united goal is to stop the war in Iraq, but we're linking that with our understanding of the need to spend money on human needs instead of war, to demand peace, justice and equality, and say no to the Republican agenda.\"</p> <p>Stickers and shirts emblazoned with Barack Obama's image, name and campaign slogans were aplenty among the marchers, although the Democratic party was not among the official organisers. </p> <p>March leaders had obtained a permit for 50,000 protesters. Police estimated the crowd at between 8,000 and 10,000.</p> <p>Compared to the Democratic convention last week in Denver, where protesters were largely confined to pens known as \"freedom cages\", St Paul was more welcoming. Demonstrators converged and mingled freely on the grounds of the state capital building, and police cleared streets along the parade route to accommodate them. Fearsome looking officers in full black riot gear guarded intersections to ensure the crowd stayed along the permitted route, but save of isolated clashes with young rioters who broke a few shop windows and caused minor mayhem, officers and demonstrators stayed clear of one another. Police arrested at least five people, including some who lit a dumpster on fire and pushed it into a police car.</p> <p>Among the protesters Monday was Melida Arredondo, who pulled a mock coffin draped with an American flag behind her. Her stepson Alexander, a Marine, was killed in 2004 in Najaf, Iraq.</p> <p>\"I am very much angered, as a gold star mom, that John McCain is saying that he will continue the occupation of Iraq to vindicate the fact that my son was killed there,\" she said. \"My son loved the Iraqi people, believed in the Iraqi people, was fed by the Iraqi people and he would not want the occupation to continue.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sarah Palin came face-to-face with the hard reality of the media examination she will undergo as John McCain's surprise choice of running mate Monday when she was forced to confirm her unmarried school age daughter was pregnant.</p> <p>The revelation immediately renewed questions about the extent to which Palin, who had been relatively unknown before McCain announced her as his vice-presidential choice on Friday, had been thoroughly vetted.</p> <p>Palin, the vice-presidential candidate and new star of the Republican party, was in St Paul, Minnesota, Monday to rally Republican convention delegates after being dispatched by McCain the previous night. The Republicans are trying to salvage their convention, which has been disrupted by media attention having switched to Hurricane Gustav.</p> <p>Palln, soon after her arrival, was caught up in questions about her private life. In response, the McCain campaign team issued a statement on her behalf stating her 17-year-old unmarried daughter is five months pregnant.</p> <p>Palin, who campaigns on a Christian, anti-abortion ticket, said the couple planned to marry: \"We're proud of Bristol's decision to have her baby and even prouder to become grandparents.\"</p> <p>The fact that her daughter is to marry and have the baby may blunt any negative reaction among any of the party's social conservatives concerned about sex before marriage. The news could even help consolidate the image of Palin and her family as typical of the average American home.</p> <p>The slow emergence of details about Palin's life, partly as a result of reporters who landed en masse in her tiny home town of Wasilla in Alaska, raised concerns about whether she had been properly vetted by McCain's campaign team or whether the usual procedures had been dispensed with because of McCain's impulsive choice.</p> <p>McCain's team insisted Monday that he had known about the pregnancy before offering her the job.</p> <p>A McCain spokesman, Steve Schmidt, said: \"Senator McCain's view is this is a private family matter.\"</p> <p>Since McCain's announcement of his vice-presidential pick on Friday, journalists examining Palin's life have begun to flesh out her biography, in particular her lack of political experience, in particular in foreign affairs.</p> <p>Mark Salter, a McCain adviser, said the campaign announced the pregnancy to rebut rumours from internet bloggers that Sarah Palin's son Trig, born in April with Downs syndrome, was actually born to Bristol and that Sarah had claimed to be the mother.</p> <p>The appointment of Palin is intended to mark a change in strategy by McCain. Having concluded it is not enough to challenge Obama over his lack of foreign experience and to push his own narrative as a Vietnam war hero, he is hoping to appeal to the working-class and the lower middle class, and believes that Palin has the right credentials for attracting these blue-collar workers.</p> <p>With the absence from the convention of McCain and President George Bush, who had been scheduled to make a prime-time speech last night at the convention but diverted instead to Texas to be seen to be on hand at the Hurricane Gustav emergency centre, Palin, the First Lady Laura Bush and McCain's wife, Cindy, led a push to raise delegates' spirits.</p> <p>Laura Bush, who was scheduled to appeal from the podium for help for hurricane victims rather than make a politically tinged speech as planned, acknowledged the frustration of delegates over the cancellation of the first day of the four-day convention.</p> <p>\"I know they're disappointed they're not going to get to have the programme tonight, but everyone understands it, everyone is thinking about everybody all across the Gulf Coast,\" she told CBS television.</p> <p>All but two hours of the conference were cancelled Monday and delegates were asked to avoid partying. A cocktail party planned for last night 'Spirits of Minneapolis' was re-titled 'Spirits of the Gulf Coast' and turned into a fundraiser for the American Red Cross Hurricane Relief Fund.</p> <p>The Republicans are hoping to resume normal business Tuesday or at least Wednesday. As long as they can have two full days of prime-time viewing, finishing as planned on Thursday night, they believe the can secure enough media attention to judge the convention a success.</p> <p>While Gustav reminded the public of the failure of Bush to deal with the devastation of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, McCain's campaign team sought to turn it to their advantage. The cancellation of the first day of the convention sent out a message that McCain cared, contrasting with the Bush's seeming indifference in the days immediately after Hurricane Katrina.</p> <p>McCain admitted on ABC News hat he was frustrated at the loss of part of the convention but added: \"This is just one of those moments in history where you have to put America first.\"<br>The hurricane diverted media attention from the Republican convention, with almost all the anchormen and women from the main networks having flown to New Orleans.</p> <p>McCain is hoping he can get them back for Palin's speech Wednesday and his own on Thursday.</p> <p>Rick Davis, one of McCain's campaign advisers, said Monday would be \"business only and will refrain from political rhetoric\", and after that decisions would be taken on a day-to-day basis.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama failed to achieve the poll bounce he hoped for from last week's Democratic convention, including Thursday's prime-time speech viewed by millions of Americans.</p> <p>A CNN poll published yesterday put him on 49% and McCain on 48%. The poll and others in recent days show Obama remains basically where he was at the start of the week. He was up only one point from a CNN poll taken seven days before.</p> <p>In the past, candidates expected to achieve significant poll jumps as a result of the overwhelming media exposure of convention week. Bill Clinton came out of his convention in 1992 with a 16% bounce and Jimmy Carter had an 8% one in 1976.</p> <p>The surprise announcement by Republican rival John McCain of Sarah Palin as his running mate on Friday could have reduced the impact of Obama's speech.</p> <p>But the lack of any bounce could also reflect resistance towards him among voters. He failed to achieve any bounce after his tour before the summer of the Middle East and Europe, including a high-profile speech in Berlin.</p> <p>Obama cancelled campaigning yesterday and today because he did not want to be seen politicking in the wake of Hurricane Gustav. He dropped plans to stay in Milwaukee last night to return to his Chicago headquarters.</p> <p>Democratic plans by staffers in St Paul to mount for an aggressive campaign to grab media attention from the Republicans have also been put on hold.</p> <p>Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, said before the convention he did not anticipate any bounce while McCain's team predicted a 15% poll rise for Obama. Axelrod may have been deliberately lowering expectations while McCain's team inflated them.</p> <p>A post-convention bounce is not crucial in deciding elections. Some candidates who achieved big rises in polls subsequently went on to lose the election.</p> <p>More important than the conventions will be the three presidential debates held in the run-up to the November 4 election.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337189321\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>New Orleans appeared today to have been narrowly spared a repeat of the devastation of Katrina three years ago when Hurricane Gustav weakened in power and veered away to the west of the city in a last-minute reprieve.</p> <p>The hurricane was categorised downwards from force three to two just before it hit land near Cocodrie, a thinly populated town west of New Orleans known for its fishing and oil industries. Dramatic television footage showed waves being forced by winds of up to 110 mph over the tops of the flood defences on the west side of the city, in a worrying echo of what happened in 2005.</p> <p>Power supplies were cut to large parts of New Orleans as falling trees downed electricity lines and flattened several homes.</p> <p>Crucially, though, sea level surges were this time mercifully limited to up to 9ft in some places, markedly less than the 27ft surges that were seen with Katrina.</p> <p>As New Orleans heaved a huge sigh of relief, towns to the west, such as Lafayette and Baton Rouge, remained imperilled. Bobby Jindal, Louisiana's governor, warned that cataclysmic flooding could still be brought by the tail end of the hurricane.</p> <p>While Gustav failed to live up to the terrifying standards set by<br>Katrina, it still succeeded in leaving both communal and political<br>chaos in its wake. Almost two million people fled the Gulf of Mexico, the largest evacuation of its kind, turning New Orleans and other communities along the coast into virtual ghost towns.</p> <p>The first day of the Republican Convention in St Paul, Minnesota, was also disrupted as John McCain and his advisers struggled to find the appropriate tone. They were acutely aware of the need to avoid any association with President Bush's handling of Katrina, which was criticised for being negligent and insensitive, yet with the threat of Gustav diminishing they were also under pressure to salvage the wreckage of their own convention.</p> <p>McCain switched his planned appearances to focus on disaster relief in Ohio and a visit to Mississippi. Bush cancelled his speech to the convention and travelled instead to Texas, from where he might still address delegates by satellite link.</p> <p>At an emergency centre in Austin Texas, he acknowledged that planning for Gustav marked an improvement over the events of 2005. \"The coordination on this storm is a lot better than on - than during Katrina,\" he said.</p> <p>McCain and Bush's absences left their spouses, Cindy and Laura respectively, as well as the newly appointed vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, to hold centre stage at the convention.</p> <p>About 1,600 died in Katrina when 90,000 square miles were flooded, including 80 per cent of New Orleans. The lack of advance planning in 2005, and the sluggish federal response by the Bush administration, has gone down in history as one of America's most shameful moments.</p> <p>By contrast, both federal and local governments were quick this year to put emergency plans in place. Fema, the federal emergency management agency that was heavily criticised over its handling of Katrina, this time effected a five-day plan under its current chief, the homeland security secretary Michael Chertoff, that saw almost 90% of the region evacuated.</p> <p>Locally, New Orleans enacted a dawn-to-dusk curfew designed to prevent the epidemic of looting that broke out in 2005. In further echoes of Katrina, the streets of the city were lined with heavily armed police officers - though this time they were spared scenes of lawlessness.</p> <p>As the storm passes over the area, and the threat recedes, questions are likely to follow over the extreme nature of the preparations. The mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, appeared to go beyond the measured reports of the hurricane forecasters in encouraging the city's residents to evacuate.</p> <p>On Sunday night, he called Gustav the \"mother of all storms\" and warned anyone who ignored the exhortations to flee that they would be \"on their own\".</p> <p>\"It was absolutely the right message to send,\" Nagin told ABC News on today in defence of his earlier remarks.</p> <p>Katrina strengthened as it came ashore into a category 4 hurricane, and did so towards the north and east, pushing the waves directly towards New Orleans and breaching the levees on the east of the city. </p> <p>Gustav swung to the northwest, putting New Orleans on the \"dirty\" side of the hurricane where rainfall is heavy but the storm surge is milder.</p> <p>It hit the levees on the west of the city, coming at an angle with lesser force. Though the waves were seen to be sloshing over the flood walls, the defences were expected to hold.</p> <p>\"The system is not inundated, it is not a breach. We are confident in<br>the stability of that wall,\" said a spokeswoman of the US Army Corps of Engineers.</p> <p>Though the levees looked likely to retain their integrity on this<br>occasion, there are also likely to be questions once the initial crisis<br>has passed about the pace of repairs to New Orleans' defences. The<br>eastern wall, breached in 2005, has been repaired by the army corps in a rebuilding programme scheduled to last until 2012, but the threatened western wall has yet to be reinforced as a result of on-going under-funding.</p> <p>With the frequency and force of hurricanes in the region of the Gulf of Mexico also appearing to be on the rise, some say as a result of global warming, there is bound to be renewed soul-searching over the long-term viability of a sub-sea level city such as New Orleans.</p>",
  "<p>There were many things that might have put a person in a bad mood yesterday morning. The fact that it was raining, of course \u2013 that was a bit annoying, and on a weekend, too. And it was the last day of August, which is always a bit sad.</p> <p>But actually, it was watching Sky News that ruined my day. On the Sunday morning programme, an American female commentator claimed that McCain's choice of vice-presidential candidate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/palin\">Sarah Palin</a> \u2013 the anti-abortion, anti-gay rights, pro-oil drilling and advocate of teaching of creationism in schools \u2013 was hugely exciting \"because she's a woman\".</p> <p>Is gender really more important than policies? Maybe I'm just a silly girl who doesn't understand anything but I always thought the reason we wanted to see a woman in power was to promote female-friendly policies, not because we just wanted someone \u2013 anyone who, you know, also wears a bra like us because, like, that would be just awesome. OK, so she wants to overturn Roe v Wade: she also has ovaries and that's the main thing.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/\">Jon Stewart</a>, the American political satirist, has already been to town on this issue. In a recent episode of his popular TV programme The Daily Show, his female reporter, Samantha Bee, po-facedly with tongue firmly in cheek, told a seemingly befuddled Stewart that, no matter what, she would vote for Palin because she has \"a vagina \u2026 and boobies.\"</p> <p>To see her nomination as a the smart alternative for disaffected Hillary supporters, is utterly ridiculous. Everything she stands for is against what women, and in particular the women who were such staunch supporters of Clinton, have fought for in the past few decades. As the American website <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/5043669/sarah-palin-when-choosing-a-woman-might-not-be-choosing-for-women\">Jezebel</a> pointed out on Friday, sometimes a vote for a woman is not a vote for women.</p> <p>Personally speaking, as an American woman with a vote, I find Palin's nomination so insulting that, frankly, I'd like McCain more if he told me not to tax my little lady brain with trying to figure out how to fill in the ballot form. It assumes that women voters are so silly and so desperate that all the Republicans need to do is throw a woman \u2013 any woman \u2013 onto the podium and we'll all squeal excitedly and tick his box. After all, we don't bother with looking at her political record: just look at her long pretty hair! I bet she uses Pantene, too, just like me.</p> <p>One of the Republicans' main criticisms of Obama has been his relative inexperience, and it's a criticism that has stuck. But they are so certain that what the party needs to do is to pull a woman \u2013 any woman \u2013 out of the hat that they have plumped for Palin, whose experience amounts to two years as governor of Alaska and mayor of a town with a population of 7,000, thereby disabling one of their biggest arguments against the Democrats. Fox News, bending itself into a pretzel this weekend trying to big up Palin, claimed that it was nonsense to say she had no international experience: after all, \"Alaska is right next to Russia.\" But of course \u2013 she probably had nice little chats with Putin across the North Pacific Ocean every afternoon. </p> <p>Palin is also currently facing an investigation for \"abuse of power\" because she is accused of trying to get her sister's ex-husband fired from his job as a state trooper. That is how desperate the Republicans were to drag some women out onto the podium: they've chosen one who is already in trouble and she hasn't even got to the White House yet.</p> <p>Of course, I speak from a privileged position. I was lucky enough to be born after the era of bra-burning. Others have already fought causes and cleared my path so effectively that I have never, as far as I know, suffered from the effects of sexism. None the less, I honestly do understand the desire to see a woman on Pennsylvania Avenue and I appreciate how much this would mean to a lot of other women in America. </p> <p>Yet to decide to vote for Palin just because she's a woman is as simplistic and narrow-minded as to not vote for her for the same reason. It is also patronising to women: is that really the only way a woman can gain power, by riding on the ticket of her gender? Yes, it would be marvellous to have a female vice-president. But that warm and fuzzy glow might burn out when this same woman begins banning abortion and legislating the teaching of creationism in schools. It's all very well to see her nomination as a triumphant symbol \u2013 but symbols are theoretical and politicians are very, very real. One need only think of Cheney to appreciate how much a vice-president's beliefs can affect people's lives. Moreover, were McCain-Palin to be elected, it is a very real possibility that she would have to takeover as president from the 72-year-old McCain.</p> <p>Of course it would be nice to see a woman in power and therefore proving that girls can play as well as boys. But Palin is not the gender representative that we have waited for all this time. To vote for Palin would do women no favours, generally or personally.</p>",
  "<p>So now Palin says h<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/us/international-usa-politics-palin.html?ei=5070&amp;emc=eta1\">er daughter is pregnant </a>\u2013 right now, five months. Click through and read the NYT story for the background on this if you're unfamiliar.<br> I doubt this is the end of this story. The McCain team has now opened up this can of worms. Very atypical, and bad message discipline. But it tells you they're frightened of something. And seeing as how this is the kind of story that's of interest to the supermarket tabloids as well as the blogs, whatever facts exist are sure to be unearthed.  Obviously many of the wingers who love Palin will rally around her in the face of this despicable assault by the Godless liberal media. But some number will surely be bothered that she raised a daughter who did this. Remember how Rove said Bush's DUI, revealed the Friday before the election, cost him three or four points with evangelicals in 2000? There's bound to be a similar effect here.</p>",
  "<p>Sarah Palin, the Republican vice presidential candidate, has revealed that her unmarried 17-year-old daughter is five months pregnant.</p> <p>A statement released by John McCain's campaign team said Bristol Palin would keep her baby, which is due in late December, and marry the child's father.</p> <p>\"Our beautiful daughter Bristol came to us with news that as parents we knew would make her grow up faster than we had ever planned. We're proud of Bristol's decision to have her baby and even prouder to become grandparents,\" Sarah and Todd Palin said in the brief statement.</p> <p>\"Bristol and the young man she will marry are going to realise very quickly the difficulties of raising a child, which is why they will have the love and support of our entire family,\" they added.</p> <p>The 44-year-old Alaska governor has four other children, the youngest of whom is six months old.</p> <p>Palin's selection as McCain's running mate was believed to be partly down to her fierce opposition to abortion, in order to placate the Republicans' Christian base, which believes McCain is too liberal on the issue.</p> <p>Sarah Palin's youngest son, Trig, was born in April with Down's syndrome. Internet bloggers had suggested Trig was actually born to Bristol Palin but that the Alaska governor claimed to be the mother to avoid the controversy. The McCain adviser Mark Salter said today's pregnancy announcement was made to rebut these rumours.</p> <p>McCain's choice of Palin, the first female governor of Alsaska and the first woman on a Republican presidential ticket, has already drawn controversy, with critics attacking her lack of experience, especially in foreign policy.</p> <p>McCain's advisers said the Arizona senator had known about Bristol's pregnancy before Palin was asked to become his running mate.</p>",
  "<p>Further thoughts on the GOP and Gustav. There was a lot of hand-wringing on the blogs yesterday about how the GOP was going to turn this calamity to its great advantage. That is still possible, but as I wrote yesterday, I don't buy it. When I wrote it yesterday I was writing mostly on gut instinct, but now I have given the matter a little actual thought.</p> <p>Gustav is an external event of the sort that happens during campaigns all the time, large and small. One party or the other usually takes advantage of them or benefits from them. But which one, and how is that decided?</p> <p>Now: in America, the images of the two parties are deeply hard-wired into people's brains, even the brains of people who don't pay much attention to politics. Walk down the street in any town in America and ask average people what the two parties stand for. Unless you get highly opinionated partisans \u2013 \"Republicans are crypto-fascists,\" \"Democrats hate America,\" etc. \u2013 I would bet you'll hear remarkably consistent answers from people. </p> <p>Democrats care more about the poor, they're more for minorities, they back unions, they're not big on throwing America's weight around and they're softer on criminals would probably be about the main five identifiers. Republicans are for the rich, they're for business over unions, they're tougher on crime, they do like throwing the US's weight around and they talk a lot more about Jesus would be the about the main five GOP identifiers.</p> <p>These traits have existed for at least 30 years (Jesus), maybe 40 years (the soft power-hard power foreign policy divide, which dates to Vietnam) and up to 70 years (the economic traits, which date to the New Deal). They are so deep in the American psyche that practically nothing can dislodge them. Hypothetically, President Obama could get into office and start a war with Russia, and I bet even that wouldn't suddenly make average Americans believe the Democrats were now the hard-power party.</p> <p>Major externalities, when they occur, feed into the deeply held preconceptions of what each party is about. The Russia-Georgia crisis played well for McCain because Americans are just conditioned to think that the GOP is more likely to take care of business when it comes to Russia. </p> <p>In reality, McCain's views and those of his advisors are extreme and dangerous. But alas that isn't what matters here. What matters is the information the American people bring to the situation: the Republicans have always been tougher on Russia, a Republican president defeated the USSR (yes, extremely simplistic and US-centric; I'm not endorsing, just explaining), McCain is a tough guy and the Repubican, ergo QED.</p> <p>Now consider a flood, especially in the aftermath of Katrina, and especially a flood hitting an urban area, a situation that finds many African American people being interviewed on television, as is the case today. Your average American is not going to bring information to this picture that will make her conclude that the Republicans are the party to handle this. She will think, without even really knowing that she's thinking it, that this is a matter for the Democrats to take care of \u2013 that the Democrats will handle this situation with more empathy and, post-Katrina, more competence.</p> <p>I'm trying to think back over major external events in recent presidential campaigns. There actually haven't been many (and I don't think this will end up being a major one). The bin Laden video that surfaced in October 2004 surely helped Bush as it reminded people that he was still out there and probably made most of them think that we still needed the tough-guy party (the tough-guy party had failed to track him down, but remembering that requires taking an extra logical step that requires intellect instead of feeling, and most people don't take that step). </p> <p>The biggest fairly recent event I can remember was the Rodney King rioting of 1992. Those riots helped Clinton, I think. Now you might suppose at first blush that images of rioting black people would help the law-and-order party. But the incidents that sparked the rioting \u2013 the beating of King by LA cops and the subsequent acquittals of three of the four officers \u2013 were so overwhelmingly unjust to average people (even average white people) that the rioting was, in some sense, understandable to many people. The black residents of Los Angeles needed empathy and the country needed reconciliation. Those are things Democrats do.</p> <p>So \u2013 who trusts Republicans to make sure that poor people harmed by an act of God are going to get a fair shake? That's a tough one for them. They'll spin it that way, and many cable hosts will play along. But cable hosts have less power over the process that goes on in people's minds than these historical identifiers. So unless they come up with some blindingly brilliant manipulation that's beyond my imagining, I can't see the GOP winning the Gustav spin war. </p>",

  "<p>This is a time to put politics aside, and concentrate instead on getting John McCain elected, so I hope it's not too insensitive of me to draw attention to the latest ingenious talking point from the Republican campaign, which is that Sarah Palin's time in office as mayor of the bustling metropolis of Wasilla, and as governor of Alaska, means she \"has more executive experience than Barack Obama and Joe Biden put together\", as Michael Goldfarb <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/mccainreport/Read.aspx?guid=5408661e-ce6b-4d02-b9c0-85e0156b0d9d\">puts it on his blog</a> at JohnMcCain.com.

  "<p>One has to be careful when making jokes about the Republican presidential campaign. They may turn out to be true. </p> <p>A month ago I wrote a column saying that <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/op-eds-&amp;-columns/op-eds-&amp;-columns/john-mccain-wants-to-drill-in-your-toilet/\">John McCain wants to drill in your toilet</a>. This comment was intended as a joke at the time, but it turns out to pretty much reflect the Republican position. The Republicans' most effective slogan for the fall election is \"drill here, drill now.\" It all depends on your definition of \"here\".</p> <p>The basic issue is straightforward. There is very little oil potentially available in the areas in which the Republicans are anxious to drill here and now. The <a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/\">Energy Information Agency</a> (these are people who work for President Bush) estimates that the oil in the offshore protected areas will eventually add about 0.2% to world's daily oil output. This would be sufficient to lower the price of gas by 3-4 cents a gallon.</p> <p>Furthermore, even with the best efforts to drill here and now, it will <a href=\"http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2008/7/10/142042/915\">still take many years</a> to get any oil whatsoever from these protected areas. Regardless of how anxious McCain and the Republicans might be to damage the environment, oil companies will not just spend tens of millions of dollars blindly drilling deepwater wells. They first have to survey the terrain carefully and then dig test wells. The EIA projects that it will take 10 years before we get the first drops of oil from drilling in currently protected areas and close to 20 years before we get our full 3-4 cent a gallon savings. That won't do a lot of good for people trying to make ends meet this year.</p> <p>The remarkable story here is that the people who follow energy policy know these basic facts. Yet, the Republicans are pushing the drill here, drill now line because they are betting the public can be kept in the dark. Just as tens of millions of people supported the war in Iraq because they thought that Saddam Hussein was tied to the attack on the World Trade Center, the Republicans are betting that they gain votes in November because tens of millions of people will believe that they are offering a credible plan to substantially reduce gas prices in the new future.</p> <p>In this respect, they are counting on their allies in major national media outlets like CBS, NBC, NPR, the New York Times and Washington Post. The job of the media is to inform the public. If the media effectively informed the public on this issue, they would be telling people that the Republicans are proposing an energy policy that can at best have a very modest impact on oil prices in the distant future, and no impact whatsoever for the near-term future. The Republicans are betting that the media doesn't bust them and tell the public the truth on this one.</p> <p>So far, the Republican's faith has been rewarded. Few news stories have given the public the facts on the oil available in the offshore protected areas. As a result, polls show that the majority of voters believe that drilling in these areas can have a substantial impact on oil prices in the very near future. </p> <p>Perhaps we should introduce a system of merit pay for reporters and news producers in which their pay depends on their success in educating the public on key issues, just as many school districts make the pay of school teachers dependent on how well their students perform. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/25/AR2008082502215.html\">School teachers </a>whose students perform badly don't get raises and could even get fired. Imagine that we applied the same standards to CBS, NBC, NPR and the Washington Post. If their audience couldn't answer basic questions about important public policy issues then the reporters responsible get their pay cut. If the audiences are especially poorly informed, then the reporters get fired.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this sort of accountability in the media doesn't exist. Most political reporters sound like high school drama coaches as they spend their time talking about candidates' appearance and speaking mannerisms. They almost never bother to discuss the positions advocated by the candidates \u2013 that might require a few minutes of real work. </p> <p>Of course the candidates know that the reporters won't ever bother to verify the claims they make, which gives them incentive to make whatever outlandish claims are most convenient. This is why we have McCain promising to drill for oil in our toilets and most voters actually believing that this will lower the price of gas.</p>",
  "<p>George Bush was today heading for Texas instead of the Republican party convention to inspect emergency efforts as hurricane Gustav raced towards the US Gulf coast.</p> <p>The president, who was pilloried for his tardy response to hurricane Katrina three years ago, was to visit Austin and San Antonio as the last residents in New Orleans prepared for Gustav to make landfall.</p> <p>He had been scheduled to appear before the Republican party in Minneapolis-St Paul to give his official blessing to Senator John McCain, the party's presidential candidate who faces Barack Obama, his Democratic rival, in the November election. </p> <p>But Gustav has thrown America's political agenda into chaos with the biggest casualty being the Republican convention, which was due to open today.</p> <p>McCain and his strategists announced yesterday they were cancelling almost all of today's programme. It is the first time in living memory that a Republican or Democratic convention has been disrupted by a natural disaster.</p> <p>In an interview broadcast yesterday, McCain said it would be inappropriate to have a \"festive occasion\" against the backdrop of a potential disaster.</p> <p>The Republicans are especially sensitive because of Bush's slow response to hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans almost three years ago.</p> <p>\"It just wouldn't be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster,\" McCain said in an interview recorded on Saturday with Fox News Sunday.</p> <p>If Gustav creates widespread devastation in the Gulf states, the Republicans will have to consider scaling back on the remaining three days of the convention. All the speeches could be ditched. But for legal reasons the convention has to find time to formally adopt McCain as the party nominee for the November 4 election.</p> <p>The disruption may work in his favour. He is not a good speaker and could be struggling to match Obama's speech in front of 80,000 supporters in Denver on Thursday. Gustav offers him a get-out: he could accept the nomination by video or another alternative to a speech from a podium.</p> <p>A truncated convention helps him in other ways too. His convention always threatened to be more fractious than the Democrats, with many Republicans prepared to voice unhappiness with him for not being conservative enough.</p> <p>Crucially, hurricane Gustav offers the Republicans a chance to make amends for Bush's failure three years ago. Charlie Crist, the Republican governor of Florida, told CNN that the level of preparation had been \"tremendous\", showing lessons had been learned from Katrina. The speedy evacuation ordered yesterday contrasted with the lack of urgency in 2005.</p> <p>It was Bush's slow response to Katrina rather than the Iraq war that led to the public change in attitude to him and the resulting steady drop in polling ratings. Bush then stuck to a schedule that took him from his ranch in Texas and to California, happily strumming a guitar at one event. He only went to the New Orleans region five days after the hurricane struck.</p> <p>Obama is almost certain to modify his campaign plans for the week because, like McCain, partisan speeches would be regarded as insensitive.</p> <p>Obama, who won one of the biggest cheers of the night on Thursday when he told supporters that Bush had allowed a major US city, New Orleans, to drown, was more restrained yesterday: \"Hopefully, we've learned from [hurricane Katrina's] tragedy,\" he said. </p> <p>He has to balance a willingness to help without being seen as opportunistic. He offered to call on his huge supporter base, built up over 20 months of campaigning, to provide funds for disaster relief and to act as volunteers in the coastal region.</p>",

Some <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en_GB\">rights reserved</a>.</p> <p>Someone using the handle <strong>YoungTrigg</strong> - perhaps not coincidentally the name of the youngest of her five children - made 30 mostly edits to the page, including that she \"would sometimes wake at 3 a.m. to hunt moose before school\" and that, as Alaskan governor, she had \"kept her campaign promises, reducing her own salary, as well as reducing property taxes 60%.\"<br></p> <p>Most of the information was taken from a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sarah-Hockey-Alaskas-Political-Establishment/dp/0979047080/ref=/ref=cm_cd_f_pb_i\">recent biography</a>, but the sceptical among you might wonder how this supporter managed such a timely and flattering update of Palin's profile before the world knew she was <strong>John McCain</strong>'s running mate. Is YoungTrigg a Republican campaigner?</p> <p>On the night before the announcement, another editor changed Palin's profile to say she was McCain's candidate. YoungTrigg posted a note saying: \"Where did you hear that Palin was the VP nominee? I can't find anything online.\" The conspiracy theorists think that was a red herring.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/01/technology/01link.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;adxnnlx=1220259707-EF5e165pZYyZb8u877rEuA\">New York Times</a> spoke to an anonymous lawyer and regular Wikipedia editor who had gone over YoungTrigg's entries and toning down partial material.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A lot of stuff was useful -- like citing a biography of her,\" he said in a telephone interview, speaking under condition of anonymity to avoid tipping off his clients that he spends time on Wikipedia. \"Some was questionable stuff.\" In general, he said, the editing \"indicates a very close familiarity with Governor Palin.\"</p> <p>\"The lawyer said that when YoungTrigg linked to government documents on a government Web site related to the trooper case, it seemed like this editor was not exactly a political na\u00eff.</p> <p>\"But, he says, this person may be Wikipedically na\u00efve. \"They didn't quite know what they were getting into -- they got a lot of conflict-of-interest notes,\" he said. And much of that original, flattering material has been overwritten.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As of today, YoungTrigg is on Wikipedia's list of users to be checked. The Wikipedia <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser#youngtrigg\">log</a> says:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"This is a new user since August 28, 2008 who has edited only the Sarah Palin page. Sarah Palin was selected by McCain as his VP the next day after the entry was gone over and sanitized. The edits have a partisan POV and are extensive. The edits evidence some familiarity with wikipedia, more than might be expected for a new user. The discussion of the edits is currently a recommended diary on the Daily KOS. If this user turns out to be someone connected to Sarah Palin it violates Wikipedia's conflict of interest rules.\"<br></p> </blockquote> <p>But we may never know; YoungTrigg's user information has now disappeared from Wikipedia, following a short spell with the label 'retired' next to his or her profile.

  "<p>Perhaps by now, in this long election season, we should have learned to expect the unexpected. After all, an \"inevitable\" Democratic nominee has already lost out to a young African-American senator from Illinois. But when John McCain picked the virtually unknown Alaska governor Sarah Palin - literally unknown to 51% of Americans, according to a new poll - astonishment was still the dominant reaction. The astonishment had barely begun to subside when a second shock followed. In response to the imminent arrival of Hurricane Gustav on the gulf coast, the Republican convention was drastically scaled back: all today's political speeches have been cancelled. </p> <p>Whatever the motive, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that the debacle could have some upsides for the Republicans. Since George Bush and Dick Cheney will be staying away, the party has avoided the biggest potential headache of the convention. And the weekend visit of McCain and Palin to assess Mississippi's disaster preparedness - an outing of questionable utility, surely, to Mississippi - could boost their image as non-partisan, responsive leaders. McCain, besides, is not a good speaker, and could be struggling to match Barack Obama's speech in front of 80,000 supporters in Denver on Thursday, Ewen MacAskill writes in today's Guardian. Gustav offers him a get-out: he could accept the nomination by video, or some other alternative to a speech from a podium.</p> <h2>Today at the convention</h2> <p>With all \"political\" speeches cancelled, the curtailed convention will centre around a brief afternoon session, during which delegates will conduct some of the procedures required to award the Republican nomination officially to John McCain. Anti-war groups plan to go ahead with plans for a major demonstration outside the convention venue.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/global/michaeltomasky/video/2008/sep/01/storm.talk\">Video: Michael Tomasky - in the eye of the storm</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/01/usa.republicans2008\">Gustav throws Republican convention into chaos</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/31/uselections2008.johnmccain1\">Campaign diary: what if nobody came</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/video/2008/sep/01/hurricane.gustav.evacuation\">Video: the evacuation of New Orleans</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/01/uselections2008.usa\">Gary Younge: the real problem with the Bush years</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/30/johnmccain.palin2\">Sarah Palin profile: Meet the Barracuda</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/01/us/politics/01memo.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin\">New York Times: Storm politics present risks and rewards</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2198984/\">Slate: McCain-Gustav '08</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/31/AR2008083101618.html?hpid=opinionsbox1\">Washington Post: Clouds over McCain</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/rogersimon/\">Politico: Is there a McCain enthusiasm gap?</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/09/democrat-joe-bi.html\">LA Times: Biden finds Palin 'good looking'</a></p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>The Obama/Biden ticket leads McCain/Palin by six points, 48% to 42%, according to Gallup's tracking poll, conducted over three days - two of them following Obama's speech and McCain's vice-presidential announcement.

A USA Today/Gallup poll found voters deeply uncertain about Palin: 39% said she was ready to serve as president if needed, but 33% said she was not, and 29% had no opinion. Forty-six per cent rated the choice as \"excellent\" or \"pretty good\". In the past two decades, only Dan Quayle has received a lower rating upon being chosen as a running-mate.</p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"It wouldn't be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster\" - John McCain, in an interview with Fox News, prompting the observation from critics that on the day Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, he was photographed celebrating his 69th birthday with George Bush, complete with birthday cake</p> <h2>Site of the day</h2> <p>In the absence of many hard facts about Sarah Palin - except that she's socially conservative, was a beauty queen, and eats mooseburgers - the website PalinFacts.com is doing a sterling job of collating hundreds of other \"facts\", much in the style of the celebrated <a href=\"http://www.ChuckNorrisFacts.com\">ChuckNorrisFacts.com</a> (which remains funnier).

  "<p>The architects of the Republican National Convention in St Paul have done the best thing they can do to repair their party's tattered image: <a href=\"http://news.google.co.uk/news/url?sa=t&amp;ct=us/2-0-0&amp;fp=48bbdf14fddc962a&amp;ei=y3i7SKfDNpWKQ9C3yNMC&amp;url=http%3A//www.nytimes.com/2008/09/01/us/politics/01repubs.html%3Fref%3Dpolitics&amp;cid=1241260544&amp;npp=POP&amp;usg=AFQjCNEurYscmR1bAas7NrH8ayx0VaWxXQ\">they have cancelled</a>.</p> <p>Alright, that's a bit of an exaggeration.

And Republican delegates are still convening to formally nominate McCain and his running mate Alaska governor Sarah Palin, after which they may receive a bounce.</p> <p>But the fact that the Republicans have to <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080831/ap_on_el_pr/cvn_convention_rdp\">scale back</a> their national convention speaks to the party's broad image problems.

Liberals have long accused the GOP of lacking compassion - but whatever Republicans were thought to lack in soft-heartedness they more than made up for in hard-headedness. Iraq, Jack Abramoff, overspending, and Katrina have undermined the public's confidence in the GOP's prudence and basic competence.</p> <p>Just last week, Alaska Republicans re-nominated Senator Ted Stevens to run for re-election in November, despite his indictment on federal corruption charges. His House colleague, Congressman Don Young, is also being investigated by the Justice Department but he appears to have survived a primary challenge as well.</p> <p>Where Republicans once were the party of fiscal rectitude, foreign-policy prudence, and sound government, they are now associated with deficits, recklessness, maladministration, and scandal. Is there anything they can do to recover?</p> <p>Despite his numerous flaws, McCain has been aggressively taking steps to right his party. First, ever since embracing campaign finance reform in the 1990s, he has challenged the corruption and ethical missteps that have plagued his colleagues on Capitol Hill. His record of standing up to the excesses and errors his of his own party is far stronger than that of his opponent, who flourished among the Richard Daley machine politicians of Chicago without a peep of protest.</p> <p>McCain has championed reforms of the earmarking process to help root out wasteful government spending and sided with reformers in his party on other key questions: the symbolic Bridge to Nowhere, offsetting Katrina relief spending with budget cuts elsewhere, and preventing entitlements from continuing to grow on auto pilot while young taxpayers get a raw deal.</p> <p>Most political observers have recognized that McCain's choice of Sarah Palin sends a message to women, especially disgruntled Hillary Clinton voters, that the GOP welcomes their support. But it also doubles down on this message of reform. <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-08-31-palin-bridge_N.htm\">Palin</a> stood up to corrupt members of her own party in Alaska in virtually every office she held and has defied the likes of Ted Stevens. She defeated a sitting Republican governor in a primary after the incumbent proposed an unpopular petroleum profits tax at a rate favored by a company that illegally funded money to his re-election campaign.</p> <p>Palin may be a conservative, but on ethics, spending, and government reform she has been more willing to challenge her own party - and take political risks - than Barack Obama.</p> <p>Even on Iraq, McCain has been trying to turn the party's image around. While most Republicans, including President Bush, took a \"stay the course\" approach as the Iraq war took an increasingly disastrous turn in 2005 and 2006, McCain advocated a new strategy. While I think the benefits of that strategy - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/28/iraq.uselections2008\">the surge</a> - have been wildly overstated, it has reduced violence enough to make more politicians contemplate US withdrawal from Iraq and at the same time increased public confidence that the war is winnable. Both developments have put the war debate on far more favorable terms for Republicans than was the case before the nigh-catastrophic 2006 elections.</p> <p>Ramesh Ponnuru of National Review has gone so far as to argue, \"If the public still wants today what it wanted in 2006 \u2014 an end to a failed foreign policy, a renewal of clean government, and a start at domestic reform, but not a sharp turn to the left \u2014 then there is one logical candidate for it to back this November: John McCain.\"</p> <p>Freed from appearances by the unpopular President Bush and vice president Dick Cheney, McCain and the Republicans can use their convention to make that very argument and rebuild their brand identity. It won't be easy, and McCain is still too close to Bush's compassionate conservatism at home and neo-conservatism abroad to make a clean break. But it is the Republicans' best option in this election cycle - assuming they can put together enough of a convention to make their case.</p>",

On his <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/neat\">myspace page</a>, where he adopts the pseudonym Haywire, he estimates those remaining in New Orleans as 50% police/military, 40% media and 10% non-evacuees. He has posted a video from yesterday illustrating his point as <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/1642569\">he rides around the city on his bike \"documenting the documentors\"</a>.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>2.05 PM:</strong> Nobody died when Gustav hit Cuba at the weekend, but huge trees were uprooted in the capital Havana and 240,000 people were evacuated from Pinar del Rio province, <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-cuba_5saug31,0,1730588.story\">the Chicago Tribune's man in Havana reported</a>.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>2.15 PM:</strong> <br>Just in from Reuters citing the NHC: Gustav has been downgraded to category 2.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>2.30 PM:</strong> The updated NHC advisory also says that there no significant strengthening of the storm expected before landfall and it is likely to weaken as it moves inland. The hurricane is moving at 16mph and is about 80 miles south/south-east of New Orleans. Maximum sustained wind speeds have fallen to 110mph, which puts it at the upper end of category 2 of the <a href=\"http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=38905\">Saffir-Simpson scale</a>.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>2.35 PM:</strong> The downgrading of the storm is good news from residents in threatened areas, both humans and beasts. A website has actually been set up specially for <a href=\"http://gustavpets.com/2008/09/01/sept-1-news-on-pet-rescue-efforts/\">pets endangered by the hurricane</a> with the catch line \"Helping Hurricane Gustav Pets\". Apparently Florida Association Kennel Club volunteers arrived in New Orleans to commemorate Katrina but have instead turned their attentions to Gustav.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>2.50 PM:</strong> Earlier, I linked to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marc-cooper/gustav-postpones-rncand-e_b_122814.html\">Marc Cooper's blog</a> on the Huffington Post suggesting Gustav would be another nail in the coffin of the Republican administration by presenting a reminder of the failures following Katrina. But another perspective, presented by <a href=\"http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=news-000002942870&amp;parm1=145&amp;cpage=2\">David Nather on CQ politics</a> is that there are opportunities for John McCain \"to demonstrate how he would change the party and distance it from the Bush years\". It has also saved the presumptive Republican candidate the embarrassment of an appearance by the hugely unpopular Bush at the Republican convention.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>3.00 PM:</strong> Dragon X has posted some interesting photos of Louisiana as it awaits the storm, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/28599124@N03/\">on Flickr</a>. One shows a man enjoying a beer on a wet street outside a bar in the French quarter of New Orleans. Surely it's a bit early in the day for a beer?</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3.15 PM:</strong> anneinlondon, in response to your comment, apparently prisoners were moved out on Thursday and Friday and are being moved to various facilities, not just Angola prison, further inland. According to <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/hurricane/index.ssf/2008/08/prisoners_being_evacuated.html\">nola.com</a> 300 of the 2,500 inmates were being released and the remaining 2,200 were evacuated.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3.30 PM:</strong> The Lafayette Advertiser warns that, despite the downgrade to a category 2 storm, <a href=\"http://www.theadvertiser.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080901/NEWS01/80901012&amp;referrer=FRONTPAGECAROUSEL\">flooding is a real risk</a>. It says that a slowing of Gustav's speed could lead to major flooding tomorrow and on Wednesday across inland Louisiana, north-eastern and parts of eastern Texas and southern Arkansas. It adds there could be 10-20 inches of rain over parts of Louisiana and southern Mississippi and East Texas.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>3.45 PM:</strong> There have been concerns that despite the levees being reinforced since Katrina, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-levees1-2008sep01,0,5294796.story\">they might not hold</a>. But a reporter from Louisiana station <a href=\"http://www.wwltv.com/video/?nvid=57429&amp;live=yes\">WWLTV.com</a> was on the west bank of New Orleans where she said a potentially vulnerable levee was holding.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>3.55 PM:</strong> In an interview with WWLTV New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin said a major fire had been contained. More worryingly he said water had been \"overtopping\" flood walls on the industrial canal but had not breached them and two small ships and a barge had broken loose and could bang against the flood walls. Despite the downgrading of the hurricane, he said: </p> <blockquote> <p>We are nowhere near out of danger yet.</p> </blockquote> <p>Nagin said there were also power outages, particularly on the east bank. WWLTV expects between six and 12 inches between now and tomorrow evening, although 20 inches is a possibility in some areas. </p> <p>He raised the possibility of major returns of people to the city on Thursday and people moving back as early as Wednesday. Nagin said the two points of concern were the west bank and the industrial canal.</p> <blockquote> <p>We are not out of the woods, that's the main message I want everyone to understand.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>4.20 PM:</strong> Electricity provider Entergy says <a href=\"http://entergy-louisiana.com/your_home/storm_center/\">a quarter of a million customers are without supplies</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the latest advisory from the NHC has the centre of Gustav making landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana. It is 70 miles south-west of New Orleans, travelling at about 15mph, and is expected to track along the south central Louisiana coast this afternoon, then move into western Louisiana tonight and eastern Texas on Tuesday. Maximum sustained winds are near 110mph but it is forecast to weaken.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>4.25 PM:</strong> The Associated Press has army corps saying levees are holding in New Orleans and elsewhere.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>4.30 PM:</strong> On gustavbloggers.com some <a href=\"http://gustavbloggers.com/?p=318\">recent photos</a> have been posted. </p> <p>It notes elsewhere on the site that, unlike when Katrina hit, mobile phones are working. It explains that the reason is that so many people have left town so the network is not overwhelmed.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>4.40 PM:</strong> On New Orleans metblogs there is a complaint about CNN running the headline: \"Floodwaters overtop industrial canal levee in New Orleans. <a href=\"http://neworleans.metblogs.com/\">Richard writes</a> that it is \"hysteria-inducing\". </p> <p>Sky has been showing <a href=\"ttp://news.sky.com/skynews/Sky-Live-TV\">film of the water going over the wall</a> for the past 15 minutes or so but there is still no report of a breach. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.wwltv.com/video/?nvid=57429&amp;live=yes\">On WWLTV</a> a councillor said that the boats in the industrial canal are not a threat and remarkably, given the conditions, that a diver is in the canal trying to see what can be done to resolve the situation.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>4.50 PM:</strong> The \"first video of Gustav\" on the LA coast can be seen on <a href=\"http://www.weather.com/multimedia/videoplayer.html?clip=11915&amp;from=hp_main_tab3\">the weather channel</a>, which is also an invaluable resource of maps charting <a href=\"http://www.weather.com/weather/map/interactive/?zoom=6&amp;lat=29.6&amp;long=-90.71&amp;interactiveMapL\">the actual</a> and potential path of Gustav.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>5.10 PM:</strong> <br>The prize for intrepid reporter must go <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/hurricane/index.ssf/2008/09/chat_with_tp_reporter_chris_ki.html\">to Chris Kirkham from the Times-Picayune paper</a> who is blogging from a large shrimp boat called the Mister Jug. He is even taking questions.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>5.20 PM:</strong> <br>We don't know whether this is in dubious taste or not, but Kauz.com, a TV station serving Wichita Falls, Texas, has a poll with the question: <a href=\"http://www.kauz.com/news/local/27734324.html\">Would you rather watch Hurricane Gustav or the Republican National Convention?</a> It rather sums up John McCain's problems. Talk about raining on the Republican parade.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>5.35 PM:</strong> <br>George Bush, who made such a hash of Katrina three years ago, has attended a briefing by emergency officials in Texas. Seeking to make amends for Katrina - and to show that his party can learn from its mistakes - the president warned: \"This storm has yet to pass. It's a serious event.\" He insisted that coordination of the emergency response to Gustav \"is a lot better than during Katrina.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>5.40 PM:</strong> <br>As Sky News gives us wall-to-wall coverage of Gustav making landfall in the US, media commentator Roy Greenslade wonders whether <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/greenslade/2008/09/gustav_a_storm_in_a_teacup.html\">it's all hype and hot air</a>. Why didn't the media rush to the Caribbean or Cuba, Greenslade wonders. Well Newsblog tried to rectify matters in its own way by including a reference to the damage in Cuba. But surely Greenslade knows why this is so. The US is where the TV stations are. And it's cheaper to cover a natural disaster - if it turns out that way - on your own doorstep.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>6.00 PM:</strong> <br>This from the Ministry of Defence. The Royal Navy has sent one of its ships to help. HMS Iron Duke - on which Prince William recently spent some time - is nomnally involved in drugs interdiction. <a href=\"http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/IronDukeOnCaribbeanHurricaneAlert.htm\">But it will provide help if needed</a>.</p> <p>\"What we bring is a range of skills coupled with professional and motivated sailors, who if faced with difficult circumstances, are able to assist,\" said the ship's captain, Commander Mark Newland.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>6.15 PM:</strong> <br>Michael Moore, the documentary film-maker, has written <a href=\"http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php?id=229\">\"an open letter to God\"</a> as a mock act of repentance for telling MSNBC that Gustav's timing, coinciding with the Republican convention, was divine intervention.</p> <p>\"Please God, let the storm die out at sea. It's done enough damage already. If you do this one favour for me, I promise not to invoke your name again.\"</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>6.35 PM:</strong> <br>It looks like New Orleans has been spared a full frontal assault by Gustav, which made landfall near Cocodrie, southwest of the city.</p> <p>Water sloshed over the top of a canal floodwall, but city officials and the Army Corps of Engineers said they expected the levees, still only partially rebuilt after Katrina, would hold. </p> <p>\"We are seeing some overtopping waves,\" Colonel Jeff Bedey, commander of the Corps' hurricane protection office, told the Associated Press. \"We are cautiously optimistic and confident that we won't see catastrophic wall failure.\"</p> <p>The extent of the damage in Cajun country was not immediately clear, and only one storm-related death, involving a woman killed in a car wreck, was reported in Louisiana. Still, the storm could prove devastating to the region of fishing villages and oil-and-gas towns, AP reports.</p> <p>That's it for live coverage of Gustav today. Thanks for your comments.

  "<p>As the red carpet is readied for the 17th anniversary of Uzbekistan's independence from the Soviet Union on September 1, for the majority of the population the euphoria of the freedom celebrations is countered by the ruthless suppression of citizen and civil society freedoms.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.umid.uz/Main/Uzbekistan/Constitution/constitution.html\">constitution of Uzbekistan</a> emphatically guarantees citizens the right to engage in public life by holding rallies, meetings and demonstrations. In practice, however, any attempts by citizens to peacefully gather to express opinions on public affairs are consistently met with stiff official resistance and hurriedly dispersed by government troops. Democratic dissent is countered by official intimidation and harassment including arbitrary detention. Activist Mutabar Tojiboyeva, who was awarded this year's Martin Ennals award for human rights, was forced to spend nearly <a href=\"http://us.oneworld.net/article/release-ailing-uzbek-rights-activist-demanded\">three years in prison</a> because she dared to question the tragic <a href=\"http://www.iansa.org/regions/scasia/andijan.htm\">2005 massacre</a> of over 500 protestors by security forces in Andijan. To date, no officials have been held responsible for the widespread loss of life. Mutabar was providing support to the victims and their family members at the time of her arrest. She was ill-treated and subject to constant torture in prison. As a result, her health deteriorated significantly. Mutabar was finally released in March this year after considerable international pressure. Although she continues to serve a suspended sentence, she remains firm in her resolve to continue to speak out against official excesses. </p> <p>At the time of writing, another civil society voice, poet and thinker Yusuf Juma, who had the courage to protest peacefully against the controversial re-election of President Karimov in December 2007, is currently serving a four-year prison term. Juma's family alleges that he has been <a href=\"http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/node/1381\">tortured severely</a>. His 22-year-old son, who was also arrested by the authorities, is missing. The official version is that he escaped. The family fears much worse.<br> The extent of suppression of civil liberties in Uzbekistan can be gauged by the restrictive Rules of Holding Mass Events brought into force in 2003 to regulate the freedom of assembly. The rules avoid any mention of the constitutional freedom to organise street marches, pickets and demonstrations. Instead, the definition of mass events is limited to \"theatrical entertainment, concert, sport, advertising and other entertaining programmes, along with the celebration of national, religious and professional events\". As a result, the legislation fails to recognise legitimate forms of public protest that are both regionally and internationally accepted. In addition, organisers are required to obtain permission from the authorities to hold any event at least one month in advance. The application is then passed through various government departments in a complicated and time-consuming approval process. Even if an event is allowed, representatives from the secret service and the Ministry of the Interior then maintain constant surveillance during the proceedings for possible threats to \"social order and safety\". They are allowed to summarily call off an event at any time. Additionally, to keep public assemblies under constant surveillance, organisers of mass events are required to allocate a minimum of 10 seats in each section and a seat in each row for members of the territorial organs of the internal security services and the national security service. </p> <p>Moreover, there are severe restrictions on the freedom to associate and carry out civil society activities. NGOs must compulsorily register before being allowed to function. Permission to register is often subjectively denied, particularly to those organisations that are likely to offer independent views and legitimate criticism of official policies. For instance, pickets and demonstrations organised by the unregistered Human Rights Defenders Alliance of Uzbekistan in the last three years have been constantly disbanded by the police and national security service troops, followed by arrests and physical assaults on participants. After each weekly protest, these <a href=\"http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR620132005?open&amp;of=ENG-UZB\">human rights defenders</a> are detained for periods ranging from hours to several days. Their homes are under constant surveillance. Random searches and administrative penalties are routine occurrences. Aside from NGOs, faith-based groups and professional associations also undergo extensive scrutiny and harassment. Between 2003 to 2007, there were 300 confirmed <a href=\"http://www.groundreport.com/Arts_and_Culture/NGO-Numbers-Wane-in-Uzbekistan\">closures of civil society organisations</a>. </p> <p>Given the prevailing environment, independence day celebrations ring hollow. If freedom is to be truly realised, constitutional rights must be a living reality for the people and civil society of Uzbekistan, rather than mere promises on paper. </p> <p><em>Tanzilya Salimdjanova &amp; Mandeep Tiwana both work with Civicus: World Alliance for Citizen Participation.

  "<p>Some of my liberal pals are nervous and think that the GOP's reasonably sensitive handling of the Gustav situation is a godsend for them. McCain and co. get to look compassionate, even like they care about black people (!), and normal Americans will just wilt at the sight of McCain's restrained stateliness.</p> <p>I don't buy it for a second. As a general rule, when politicians act stately in public, they're terrified of something in private. Republicans are terrified in general of the memory of Katrina. And specifically, they're terrified of <a href=\"http://blogs.cqpolitics.com/davidcorn/McCain-Bush%20photo.jpg\">this</a>. Click on it and take a look. It was snapped just as Katrina was closing in on the Gulf Coast shore. If the GOP went ahead with its convention as normal, I presume that photo would be in an Obama ad in no time. That's point number one.</p> <p>Point number two: The real reason for this convention is not to push the GOP's positive agenda. That's a nice side story. But the real reason to have a four-day Muslim-unpatriot-a-pollooza. This is what Dick Cheney and, in a more restrained and presidential way, George Bush were supposed to do Monday night. It is surely what Rudy Giuliani and Joe Liberman are supposed to do Tuesday night, if Tuesday evening's session still comes off.</p> <p>The Republicans' best shot at winning this November is to raise questions about Obama in the minds of enough voters. They can win, in other words, only be going negative. Therefore, every minute of Obama-hating on national TV the GOP loses is a minute that helps the Democratic candidate. Ideally from Obama's perspective, and assuming of course a minimum loss of property and life, the optimal result is no convention Monday and Tuesday nights. Let Palin and McCain speak. She'll come across as the lightweight she is, and he'll be seen as conducting a salvaging operation.</p> <p>The one danger for Democrats is that somehow the Republicans manage to turn their convention into a virtual telethon for hurricane victims, which actually might fool some people and produce a silver lining for them. But they're not canceling their sessions because they think it's the noble thing to do. They're canceling them because politically, they have no choice. There is no way they could be putting on a convention while the Gulf coast flooded. Go look at that photograph again.</p>"
