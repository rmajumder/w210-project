  "<p>Thousands of supporters of Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, gathered in Tbilisi yesterday to cheer his vow to punish Russia for the devastating attacks of the past few days and sing the country's national anthem.</p> <p>Waving flags as they streamed to Freedom Square outside the parliament building, the crowd was mix of pensioners, businessmen, students and young reservists who had earlier been called up to fight the separatists and their Russian allies. </p> <p>One placard showed a picture of Putin with the slogan: \"Wanted: crimes against humanity and the world.\"</p> <p>Flanked by bodyguards, Saakashvili arrived about an hour after the start of the rally to applause and cheers. \"I promise you today that I'll remind them of everything they have done and one day we will win,\" he said. </p> <p>Some people said they had never been to a political rally before. \"We are a united nation, everybody is supporting Saakashvili. He has defended our country,\" 28-year-old Arteym Oganeyzov said. </p> <p>But some were sceptical. \"Why did [Saakashvili] take on Russia with 10,000 soldiers? Maybe he was thinking somebody would help us. But nobody did help us,\" Bacho Janashia, a 24-year-old student said. He added: \"We hope Saakashvili disappears from Georgia.\" Why? \"Because he's a bastard.\" </p> <p>Georgia, which declared independence in April 1991 when the Soviet Union crumbled, is a nation of about 4 million people with a small US-trained army. Russia, with a population of about 142 million, has a huge, well-equipped military. </p> <p>Over the last few days Georgia's main TV station has shown movies depicting small armies relying on courage and heroism to fight bigger forces - including the film 300, which shows a band of Spartans fighting a huge Persian invading army. </p> <p>Georgian troops were yesterday forced out of its second breakaway region, Abkhazia, according to Abkhaz officials and Moscow. Abkhaz forces took down a Georgian flag flying over administrative headquarters in the town of Chkhalta, they said. The claim appeared to be confirmed by the Georgian Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili. \"We removed everything we had there, police and civilians,\" he told Reuters, adding that the upper Kodori gorge was entirely in Russian and Abkhaz hands. </p> <p>Georgia has accused Russia of aiding the Abkhaz forces, after Moscow poured 9,000 troops into the west Georgian region as fighting raged between Russian and Georgian forces in breakaway South Ossetia further east. </p> <p>Utiashvili said about 600 police officers had been stationed in the gorge. It is the only part of Abkhazia controlled by Tbilisi. The Abkhaz separatists said they had pushed the Georgians from the area. \"Units from the Abkhaz military have completed an operation to push out the Georgian army ... from the upper part of the Kodori gorge,\" a spokesman for Abkhazia's self-styled president, Sergei Bagapsh, was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying.</p>",
  "<p>Talks to resolve Zimbabwe's political crisis were on the brink of collapse last night as Robert Mugabe refused to surrender control of the government, despite losing the country's last credible election.</p> <p>South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, who has been mediating the negotiations, was making a final push to reach agreement before heading back to Pretoria. </p> <p>But the two sides remained far apart as the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, continued to insist that democracy be respected.</p> <p>Mbeki arrived on Sunday with his aides predicting an agreement within the day in the hope that a new government and parliament would be installed this week, permitting Mbeki to claim a success at a regional heads of government summit in Johannesburg this weekend. </p> <p>But although Tsvangirai had endorsed a plan for Mugabe to remain president with a largely ceremonial function, the opposition said it became apparent Zimbabwe's ruler for the 28 years since independence did not intend to give up power. </p> <p>Zanu-PF is trying to reach a deal with the leader of a small breakaway Movement for Democratic Change faction, Arthur Mutambara, whose 10 seats in parliament hold the balance of power.

The group said 32 people have been murdered in political violence since the election.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron sets himself a high bar whenever he discusses geopolitics at his monthly press conference. On a wall a few feet from the Conservative leader's regular podium hangs Karsh's glowering portrait of the wartime Churchill.</p> <p>Yesterday Cameron was happy to invoke Churchill's rejection of appeasement in the 1930s to underpin his own call for a tough Nato/EU response to Russia's invasion of the Georgian heartland - a sovereign democracy and UN member. \"History has shown time and time again that if you leave aggression to go unchecked, you only store up graver problems for the future,\" the Tory leader warned.</p> <p>He was less keen to recall that at a meeting in the Kremlin in 1944 prime minister Churchill took \"half a sheet of paper\" on which to divide Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria and Greece into British and Soviet spheres of influence (\"Romania, Russia 90%\") - and Georgian-born Stalin ticked it with his blue pencil. Yet by 1944 Britain was playing the weak hand which would become permanent as America's junior partner in the cold war. Russia's grip on three of the four \"blue pencil\" states lasted until 1989. Now all are EU/Nato members.</p> <p>Should that be Georgia's destiny too, even if geographers have long disputed whether it is in Europe or Asia? Unlike Germany, France, even Italy and some smaller Nato/EU members, Britain agrees with the US that it should; Ukraine too if it fulfils the economic and political criteria. </p> <p>But Nato's divided April summit in Bucharest meant that it didn't say Yes, only \"Eventually\". The result is this weekend's bloodshed in the Caucasus, analysts in London agree. \"For Moscow the message from the Bucharest compromise was that pressure works,\" says Tomas Valasek of the CER thinktank, though a Yes might have goaded Putin's oil-rich, reassertive Russia even more.</p> <p>As a ceasefire took hold last night, Gordon Brown resurfaced to insist \"there must be talks\". Cameron exercised an opposition leader's privilege in talking tougher: possible suspension of Russia's G8 membership and its EU partnership talks, a squeeze on visas. What about threatening the 2014 Winter Olympics in nearby Sochi, ask others?</p> <p>The dynamics of a US election goad John McCain and Barack Obama into hawkish rhetoric. In Europe, which has overdosed on war as an instrument of policy and needs Russian oil and gas, the pressure is usually the other way: hence the Sarkozy peace plan. </p> <p>Not even the Americans plan to act, as Georgia's impetuous, nationalist president, Mikhail Saakashvili, must have hoped: his fateful miscalculation in attacking South Ossetia.</p> <p>Britain does not always take the US side, it backed negotiation with Tehran where Russian help is another reason for avoiding even worse relations with Moscow. Putin's brutal reassertion of Stalin's authoritarian tactics, at home and abroad, makes it ever harder for the west to pretend that post-Soviet Russia is evolving into a liberal democracy.</p> <p>But what to do to discourage the destabilisation of Ukraine too? Even if the status quo is restored, unlikely, the Georgian dispute has further undermined Nato and EU solidarity, as it was meant to. At the Chatham House thinktank, James Nixey admits it has been a good week for those who have argued Georgia is too strategically important to Russia ever to be allowed to join Nato.</p>",

  "<p>The Kremlin's decision today to call a halt to its five-day assault on Georgia leaves Russia calling the shots in the energy-rich Black Sea littoral and Caspian basin.</p> <p>The quick and easy victory exposes the west's lack of leverage over a resurgent Russia despite years of heavy American political investment in Georgia.</p> <p>In the tussle for supremacy in a vital strategic region, the balance has tilted. Russia has successfully deployed its firepower in another country with impunity for the first time since communism's collapse.</p> <p>\"This is not the Russia of 93 or 94, a terribly weakened Russia,\" said a European official. \"The Russians are now negotiating from a position of strength.\"</p> <p>The impact of Mikheil Saakashvili's rash gamble storming South Ossetia last week and of Vladimir Putin's comprehensive rout of the Georgians will ripple in many directions.</p> <p>In less than a week, Putin has redrawn the geopolitical map of the contested region between Russia, Turkey, and Iran.</p> <p>\"We don't look very good,\" said a former Pentagon official long involved in Georgia. \"We've been working on [Georgia] for four years and we've failed. Everyone's guilty. But Putin is playing his cards brilliantly. He knows exactly what he's doing and the consequences are all negative.\"</p> <p>While Russia walks tall, Saakashvili will struggle to survive as one of the world's youngest presidents. The Europeans are already divided and vulnerable to charges of indecision and impotence. Nato splits over Georgia and Ukraine will widen. American policies in the region have been severely set back. Western energy policy is looking flaky.</p> <p>\"This was a proxy war, not about South Ossetia, but about Moscow drawing a red line for the west,\" said Alexander Rahr, Russia expert at Germany's Council on Foreign Relations and a biographer of Putin. \"They marched into Georgia to challenge the west. And the west was powerless. We're dealing with a new Russia.\"</p> <p><strong>Ceasefire</strong></p> <p>Following President Dmitri Medvedev's call for a halt today, the first priority is a proper ceasefire. That has to be agreed, then implemented, then monitored, all very tricky with ample scope for further confusion, breakdown and bloodshed.</p> <p>Moscow is dictating the terms. According to European officials briefed on today's talks in Moscow with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, the Russians are insisting on an end to 15 years of Georgian troops being part of the peacekeeping contingent in breakaway South Ossetia and are demanding that Saakashvili sign a legally binding pledge abjuring the use of all armed force in relation to the two pro-Russian provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.</p> <p>In recent months, Saakashvili has repeatedly refused to sign such a commitment. \"Russia seems to have all the cards,\" said another European official. \"Russian soldiers have been in South Ossetia and Abkhazia for 15 years. The outcome of the negotiations will probably be the entrenchment of the Russian presence in both of the enclaves.\"</p> <p><strong>Saakashvili</strong></p> <p>Such an outcome leaves the 40-year-old Georgian president wounded, perhaps fatally. Moscow has already launched a concerted propaganda offensive painting the Georgian leader as a war criminal and using analogies from the Balkan wars to accuse him of \"genocide\". The Russians will control South Ossetia and send in military prosecutors to find evidence of atrocities. Moscow wants rid of him. Character assassination and secret service shenanigans will increase doubts about Saakashvili at home and abroad in the Russian hope that Saakashvili's own electorate will turn against him, although there is no obvious successor.</p> <p>Saakashvili has enjoyed strong American support. \"He has to be protected at all costs,\" said the former Pentagon official. But many European governments are lukewarm about him, regarding Saakashvili as \"his own worst enemy\" and are hoping that Barack Obama will distance himself from the Georgian president.</p> <p><strong>The price of victory</strong></p> <p>If the Kremlin is celebrating an apparent win-win situation, much of the world has been appalled at Russia's invasion of a small defenceless neighbour. How will the west respond?</p> <p>Obama has talked of blocking Russia's ambition to join the World Trade Organisation. There have been calls to throw Russia out of the G8. Some of the former Soviet satellites in eastern Europe now in the EU are calling on Brussels to freeze negotiations with Moscow on a new long-term partnership pact.</p> <p>But with a surfeit of petro-dollars in the bank and its fingers on the energy valves that keep Europe warm, the Kremlin appears blithely contemptuous of any potential western retribution. Relations between Russia and the west are already poor and will worsen further, but there are unlikely to be any concrete penalties.</p> <p>\"What can have an impact on the Russians without damaging us more than them,\" asked one of the European officials.</p> <p><strong>Nato and the EU</strong></p> <p>The Russians see the Caucasus test as a zero-sum game and have won. That means lose-lose for the west. A key objective for Putin was to destabilise Georgia to invalidate its aim of joining Nato. He may have succeeded.</p> <p>The Americans suffered a rare defeat in April at a Nato summit when George Bush argued strongly for starting Georgia towards alliance membership and was defeated by Angela Merkel of Germany and Sarkozy of France.</p> <p>\"This is the first time ever that an American president's request was rejected because France and Germany stuck together,\" said a senior source at the Elysee Palace in Paris.</p> <p>In a tough statement yesterday, John McCain said the Nato rebuff to Georgia \"might have been viewed as a green light by Russia for its attacks on Georgia. I urge the Nato allies to revisit the decision.\"</p> <p>But the French and the Germans feel vindicated in rejecting Georgia and are unlikely to bend.</p> <p>\"A country that has such problems and is led by a hot-headed militant does not belong in Nato,\" said Rahr in Berlin. \"It could take the whole alliance hostage and start the third world war.\"</p> <p>EU foreign ministers meet tomorrow in Brussels on Georgia, but are riven over how to respond. </p> <p>\"The spectrum of views in the EU is very wide. It ranges from cold warriors to appeasers,\" said one of the European officials. \"It will be hard to get a consensus.\"</p> <p>Four EU leaders from the Baltic states and Poland went to Tbilisi today to show solidarity with Georgia and denounce the Russian \"imperialism\" they have all been victims of in the past.</p> <p>The Italian government, by contrast, said it was \"close to Putin's position. This war has pushed Georgia further away from Europe.\"</p>",
  "<p>My buddy Barack Obama is planning to announce his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/12/barackobama.uselections2008\">vice-presidential selection via text message</a> and email. He told me so on Twitter. See, I follow him on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/BarackObama\">Twitter</a>, meaning I get little updates of 140 letters or less when he travels to another country for a speech or when he decides what the medium for his VP announcement will be. He follows me and 58,260 other Twitterers in return, which means he's privy to my happy-birthday note to my brother, garage sale advice to my pal Steph, and my exclamations of delight on tasting an $18 glass of wine. We're like old friends.</p> <p>In his Tweet \u2013 that's what the in-crowd calls messages on Twitter \u2013 Obama <a href=\"http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/firsttoknow\">instructed his virtual pals</a> to \"Text VP to 62262\" in order to be among the first to know the big news. I thought about it. I pictured myself receiving the text message and squealing with glee as though my best friend told me she was pregnant. I figured it would happen in the grocery store where I could make a big scene of it. But I didn't sign on. Why? Well, it's just not that urgent. I can find out who his running mate will be via text message, email or regular old Google News, and I'll still be among the first to know. Heck, I could probably wait for the next day's newspapers to come out and still know before a lot of folks.</p> <p>But that's probably not the point, is it? The point is a sense of connection. Many <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1700525,00.html\">young Americans</a> already feel more connected to Obama than to John McCain because, while McCain is old enough to be our grandfather, Obama's only old enough to be perhaps a big brother or an uncle. And while that may not be the reason we cite when deciding who will have our support in November, a sense of connection might be just what it takes to sway some undecided voters.</p> <p>Meanwhile, everyone I know is trying to create the same sense of connection with everyone from professional contacts to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/internet.familyandrelationships\">potential dates</a>. As I complained loudly about a general shortage of professional opportunities, one person urged me to contact a friend of a friend whom he \"knows\" through <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/\">LinkedIn</a>, a sort of Facebook for job hunting. But what am I supposed to say? \"Hi, we've never met, but I know someone who has a vague idea of who you are, and he thinks you should give me a job.\" That just doesn't sound promising.</p> <p>And really, are we any more connected to Barack Obama than to this supposed professional contact we've never even met?</p> <p>Look at John Edwards, whose all-American boy image has just been tarnished with the news of his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/johnedwards.uselections2008\">extramarital affair</a>. I thought I had an idea of who Edwards was, but cheating on his ailing wife is a rather scummy thing to do \u2013 not what I expected of him. Obama could just as easily have skeletons in his own closet. I don't particularly want to know about them, but I also don't want to develop a false sense of closeness to this person who is, essentially, still a stranger to me.</p> <p>I appreciate that Obama's team reaches out to younger voters by embracing our favourite forms of communication. But at the end of the campaign, we have to remember to vote for the candidate who will make the best president, and as far as I know, prolific texting isn't part of the job description.</p>",

  "<p>Abortion rights supporters today launched a campaign to defeat a proposed ban on the procedure in the state of South Dakota, citing potentially sweeping ramifications for US healthcare policy.</p> <p>A coalition of advocacy groups - led by Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) - denounced this year's South Dakota abortion ballot initiative as the first step towards undoing Roe v Wade, the 1973 US supreme court ruling that preserved abortion rights.</p> <p>\"The measure in South Dakota would allow politicians to interfere with personal decisions best made by women and their families,\" ACLU executive director Anthony Romero said in a statement.</p> <p>The South Dakota ban is similar to a 2006 ballot measure that voters rejected, 56% to 44%, prompting speculation that the era of dominant social conservatism was on the wane in America.</p> <p>But public coolness to that ban appeared to rest with its lack of exceptions for women impregnated by incest or rape as well as women whose pregnancies endanger their health. Even George Bush, a fervent abortion opponent, signalled he disagreed with the ban's restrictive nature.</p> <p>The new South Dakota proposal includes the three key exceptions, and its authors believe the changes can ensure its passage. </p> <p>Critics of this year's ban, such as Planned Parenthood action fund president Cecile Richards, believe the exceptions are drawn up so as to ensure their ineffectiveness. Richards said the ban's authors have falsely depicted it as an improvement on the 2006 measure.</p> <p>\"They are being deceptive by characterising this proposed law as more reasonable and less restrictive,\" Richards said in a statement. \"[T]he truth is that this ban would be the most rigid and inflexible ban on abortion in the United States.\"</p> <p>The measure is unlikely to sway South Dakota's presidential vote, but its ramifications will be felt in the contest between Barack Obama and John McCain. </p> <p>McCain has twice called for the Republican party platform - which opposes abortion - to carve out the rape, incest and health-based exceptions for women seeking the procedure. </p> <p>Yet ABC news reported in May that social conservatives were pressuring McCain against trying to change the platform before Republicans nominate him next month in St Paul, Minnesota. McCain has yet to publicly embrace the South Dakota ban, which could be seen as a defence of his previous stance on the platform.</p> <p>The McCain camp did not return a request for his stance on the South Dakota ballot measure.</p> <p>If the ban is approved in November, the South Dakota state government has warned that it \"will likely be challenged in court\" as unconstitutional. </p> <p>Another state-level referendum is facing the same fate in Colorado, where voters are being asked whether human \"personhood\" begins at conception. If passed, that measure would make Colorado the first state to outlaw abortion outright since the Roe court ruling.</p> <p>The Colorado ban has secured endorsements from \"over 70\" anti-abortion physicians, according to its backers. But in the state's closely fought Senate race, both Democratic candidate Mark Udall and self-described \"pro-life\" Republican Bob Schaffer are opposing the ban.</p> <p>\"I think there are other strategies and tactics that get us far closer to advancing the cause of human life,\" Schaffer told a local Colorado radio station this month.</p>",
  "<p>Nature, one of the world's leading science magazines, normally carries obituaries only of Nobel prizewinners and scientists of similar stature, but it made an exception for <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v454/n7202/full/454290a.html\">Sir John Templeton [subs nec]</a>, the financier and philanthropist who gave hundreds of millions of dollars to promote the scientific <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/10/usa\">study of religious beliefs</a>. He thought they were true, or at least referred to real facts about the world, and thus could be studied with profit by real scientists. Naturally, this infuriates the Dawkinsian atheists, who, for all their talk of applying reason to religion, want in fact to abolish it and extinguish its memory except as something with which to frighten children. So I was aware that writing the obituary was a controversial undertaking.</p> <p>I only had one letter back, though, which surprised me, and it was a reasoned and interesting one from which I learned a great deal. A reader in Dallas, Texas, write in to protest because I had said that people who believed the universe was amoral must think of themselves as being on the losing side.</p> <blockquote> <p> To many nonbelievers, like myself, we are perfectly content with believing that the universe is amoral and without purpose. Believing this way takes nothing away from our fascination with this place or its mysteries, nor does it make us less emotionally 'positive' than others. To me, believing this way feels neither false to the facts nor to be on a losing side. I assume that those who do believe in a purpose-driven, moral universe also don't feel that they are on a losing side.</p> </blockquote> <p>Obviously you can be moral and still believe that the universe is not on your side: in some sense, morality wouldn't be morality at all if it consisted only in signing up with the big winner. But it seems to me obvious that if you believe that in the long run all good deeds are worthless, this will clearly influence your attitude, and your tendency to defect in moments of crisis.</p> <p>This is not quite the same thing as saying that the universe is an amoral thing. I don't see that it is possible to make any reliable judgment about the character of the universe as a whole, or whether it is the sort of thing that could be said to be moral or amoral. At a minimum, though, one has to suppose that the universe has room for goodness as a fact. It's not just a delusion, which we are free to shuck when it is convenient.</p> <p>So I wrote back to say this, and got a response saying that he did not disagree with this, necessarily. What he minded was the constant use of religious language in American political discourse, and the way that this seemed to exclude all atheists from full citizenship. I can't argue with that. It's a commonplace that to call yourself an atheist in the US is to render yourself unelectable. Richard Dawkins' agent, John Brockman, told me once that he would never identify as an atheist, even though he is one. The last 29 years have been terrible for American believers in reason and progress. They have been pushed further and further to the margins of a society where once they could believe themselves the vanguard. The process started with the election of Ronald Reagan, but it was Jimmy Carter before him who made it clear that evangelical Christianity was something that could elect presidents. Carter, a devout, old-fashioned Baptist, believes in the separation of church and state. But his successors as Christians in public life have not been so scrupulous.</p> <p>What's worse for American atheists on the left is that the only way for the Democrats to fight back against the religious right has been to adopt religious language and codes themselves. Barack Obama is absolutely on the side of God. \"I just want all of you to pray that I can be an instrument of God... I am confident that we can create a Kingdom right here on earth,\" he said in this campaign, according to my correspondent in Dallas. It's not far from here to the position that no atheist should be president of the US. One can see how this would upset atheists, especially the sort convinced that religion is an affliction of the stupid, which clever people must grow out of.</p> <p>The question is whether anything can be done about this kind of exclusionism, which would not replace the exclusion of atheists by the exclusion of religious believers. Is it really possible entirely to exclude religion from politics? Obviously, we can exclude theology from politics. But religion is not theology. It is far more about belonging and behaviour than believing; and the awful thing is that belonging matters more to us than behaviour. We want our opponents to be unprincipled fools. Morality, in this sense, is not absolute, but always relative to the moralists: it is a question of sharing our values, and our priorities. It's logically possible that someone working for my destruction and that of my family is good and right, but I will never come round to understanding that emotionally unless I feel, as in wartime, that we are both in the service of some greater good against some greater enemy. Nor should I.</p> <p>Now, it does not in fact matter whether the atheist is immoral. What drives this kind of exclusion is the perception that in times of crisis only moral people should vote: and \"moral\" means here those who share the values and interests of our tribe. That is very hard to argue with. If you think that liberal democracy is the highest value, one form of the dilemma is to ask whether we should tolerate parties which are dedicated to its overthrow: the traditional answer has been something like \"Yes, providing they don't get too powerful\". That is why Germany has laws against various neo-Nazi parties, and why we have <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6162690.stm\">considered</a> <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/banning-hizb-uttahrir-would-not-help/2007/07/09/1183833426764.html\">banning Hizb-ut-Tahrir</a>. In the end, because religion is about belonging, religious allegiance provides a shorthand answer to the desperately important question of whom you can trust. This is a question that the market makes chronic and painful, since everyone in it is always on the lookout for a better deal. In Europe we tend to think, still, that we can trust the state, though this is wearing out (how many people now trust the NHS?). In the US, they don't seem to trust the federal government for anything. That's partly the result of a sustained propaganda campaign from Reagan onwards. So the need for some other way to distinguish the trustworthy from the untrustworthy becomes more urgent, and religion is one of the most effective ways yet discovered to produce a social identity.</p> <p>It used to be the case that party allegiance, in a democracy, told you who you could trust. But that doesn't seem to work any more. When party politics go post-ideological, we need huge ideologies to tell us who are really friends or foes. And anyone who thinks it peculiarly disgusting or illiberal that these ideologies should be religious in the US might ask how a commitment to \"Enlightenment values\" feels to a religious believer in Europe.</p>",

  "<p>The former US national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, has called on the world community to isolate Russia in protest over its campaign in the Caucasus, likening its tactics to those of \"Hitler or Stalin\".</p> <p>Brzezinski, who was the national security adviser under President Jimmy Carter from 1977 to 1981, and is now an occasional adviser to the Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, said the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, was \"following a course that is horrifyingly similar to that taken by Stalin and Hitler in the 1930s\".</p> <p>He said that Putin's \"justification\" for splitting up Georgia - because of the Russian citizens living in South Ossetia - could be compared to when Hitler used the alleged suffering of ethnic Germans in the Sudetenland as a pretext for annexing Czechoslovakia in 1938.</p> <p>In an interview with the conservative German daily Die Welt, he said even more striking were the parallels between Putin's strategy against Georgia and Stalin's invasion of Finland in 1939, describing both as \"the undermining of the sovereignty of a small, democratic neighbouring state through the use of violence\". He added: \"Georgia is to an extent the Finland of today, both morally and strategically.\"</p> <p>Polish-born Brezinski, 80, who earned a reputation as a hardliner due to his anti-Soviet politics, said the world was now being confronted with the question as to how it should react to Russia and what he saw as its efforts to \"reincorporate old Soviet areas into the Kremlin's sphere of control\". He said at the heart of the issue was access to oil and specifically who controlled the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline which runs through Georgia.</p> <p>\"If Georgia no longer has its sovereignty it means not only that the west is cut off from the Caspian Sea and Central Asia, but we can also assume that Putin will exercise a similar strategy against Ukraine if he faces resistance. He's already publicly voiced threats against Ukraine.\"</p> <p>\"If Russia continues on this path it has to be isolated by the international community,\" he said, including economic sanctions on which all alliances from the European Union to Nato would have to take a joint stand.</p> <p>He added that Russia's invasion of Georgia was proof of the failure of the White House during George Bush's eight year tenure, to recognise the \"Putin regime\" for what it really was.</p> <p>\"Two episodes illustrate this better than any others,\" he said. \"First, when Bush met Putin for the first time and said he had looked into his soul and could trust him. Secondly, when Condi Rice, not so long ago, said that the American-Russian relations had never been better than they are today.\" He said the White House had deceived itself.</p> <p>Asked why it was that he only spoke of Putin and not of the Russian president, Dmitri Medvedev, Brzezinski said: \"He [Medvedev] has about as much influence over the current situation as the official head of state in the Soviet Union of the 1950s had over the Soviet Union. Nobody can even remember his name.\"</p>",
  "<p>Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, may have been hitting the phones in the crisis over Georgia, yet it is Nicolas Sarkozy who has emerged as the west's point man in efforts to reach a diplomatic solution.</p> <p>The hyperactive French president will meet his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, before holding a news conference and then going on to Georgia to meet Mikhail Saakashvili, the Georgian leader, who has accused Moscow of trying to \"murder a small country\".</p> <p>With the US too close to Georgia, France has emerged as the honest broker in the conflict. The Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin - the man really calling the shots in this crisis - yesterday let fly at President Bush's administration. He was furious at the US airlift of Georgian troops to Tbilisi from Iraq, where they have been helping the Americans.</p> <p>France's moment in the diplomatic limelight stems partly from circumstance. As the current holder of the rotating EU presidency, France can naturally be expected to take the lead in trying to defuse the crisis, which began with Georgia's attempt to retake its breakaway province of South Ossetia. </p> <p>But Sarkozy also fancies his chances of pulling off a diplomatic coup because of his good relations with Moscow. France, along with Germany, opposed Bush's move to put Georgia on a fast track to Nato membership at the Nato summit in Bucharest in April.</p> <p>The French president was also one of the few European leaders to congratulate Putin on his party's parliamentary election victory in a ballot that was widely criticised as unfair. (Though of course, Bush thought Putin trustworthy after looking him in the eye when they first met, in 2001.)</p> <p>Sarkozy, who relishes being at the centre of attention, also has an eye on his poor poll ratings at home. Last month, he managed to get Arab and Israeli leaders to sit at the same table for the launch of his Mediterranean Union project, so more diplomatic success could revive his fortunes on the home front.</p> <p>Yet this is no mere vanity project for Sarkozy, and France has been putting in the diplomatic legwork. </p> <p>The French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, has preceded his boss to the region. France last night circulated a draft resolution at the UN security council calling for an \"immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities and the complete withdrawal or Russian and Georgian forces\" before August 7. </p> <p>Other elements of the plan call for a humanitarian corridor and for a European peacekeeping force to replace the Russian \"peacekeepers\", which have been deployed in South Ossetia since 1992. Eager for a lifeline out of the mess it has unwittingly created, Georgia has accepted the proposal. </p> <p>But the Russians are not biting. They are unhappy that the resolution, in the words of their ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, is \"too soft\" on Georgia, and contains \"no reference to Georgian aggression or Georgian atrocities\".</p> <p>The Russians are probably still working out how far they can push in pursuit of their goal of \"regime change\" in Georgia. Putin, as has become all too evident, loathes the polished, US-educated Mikhail Saaskashvili and wants a leader in Tbilisi more willing to kowtow to the Kremlin. The Russians hold all the cards and are in no hurry to end the crisis, although they say they have now stopped all military operations in Georgia.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Sarkozy has all the familiar problems involved in trying to keep the EU's 27 members marching in step. Unsurprisingly, members formerly in the Soviet orbit - Poland and the three Baltic countries - want a complete review of relations with Russia; with Ukraine, they want the strongest possible backing for Georgia.</p> <p>\"Old Europe\", on the other hand, which relies on Russia for 30% of its gas supplies, does not want to antagonise Moscow. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who is due to meet Medvedev in Sotchi, on the Black Sea, has thrown her support behind the French peace effort. </p> <p>Germany is particularly dependent on Russia for its energy needs, and so is not going to condemn Moscow strongly. And Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian leader and a man with his own authoritarian tendencies, has warned against an \"anti-Russian\" coalition in Europe. </p> <p>Be that as it may, at some point there will be a diplomatic agreement in a form that may not be a million miles away from the French plan. In which case, Sarkozy will not be shy in claiming credit for shuttle diplomacy. The US, meanwhile, will have played only a bit part, and that fact will be seen as further evidence of its diminished status - in the waning days of the Bush administration, at least.</p>",

  "<p>Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan stands virtually alone today while facing the most serious challenge to his presidency: possible <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/08/11/pakistan.musharraf/?iref=mpstoryview\">impeachment</a> by the new democratically-elected government. </p> <p>The potential charges are serious: conspiring to destabilise the government that was elected last February, unlawfully removing the country's top judges in November 2007, and failing to provide adequate security to Benazir Bhutto before her assassination last December. Allying himself with the Bush administration has increased his unpopularity, especially following <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/UKNews1/idUKISL22167020080728\">missile attacks</a> by the US in Pakistan's tribal areas.</p> <p>Despite earlier differences over how to deal with Musharraf, Pakistan's leading political parties are now united against him. Feuding between the Pakistan People's party, led by Bhutto's widower, Asif Ali Zardari, and the Pakistan Muslim League (N), led by Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister, had given Musharraf a chance to regain some standing after his allies were defeated in the February elections. American reluctance to abandon Musharraf \u2013 together with prolonged electricity shortages, which made the new government appear incompetent \u2013 also raised his hopes.</p> <p>Musharraf may be counting on the army, his primary constituency, to bail him out of this crisis. Though such support remains a possibility, it is unlikely that the army leadership will extend itself on his behalf.</p> <p>Though a protege of Musharraf, the army's chief of staff, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7024719.stm\">General Ashfaq Kayani</a>, is a professional soldier for whom the army's institutional interests are more important than the political interests of his former army boss. Kayani has repeatedly declared that the army will not interfere in political affairs, and that the parliament and constitution are supreme.</p> <p>Even if the army is tempted to step in on Musharraf's behalf, it has been chastened by political developments during the past year. The entire <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/06/09/pakistan.lawyers/index.html\">legal community</a> arose to demand restoration of the country's judges and reinforcement of the rule of law. The public's demand for free elections and the resulting creation of a democratic government have forced the military to accept the public will.</p> <p>The army has also paid a heavy price for Musharraf's approach to the war on terror. Suicide bombers have struck repeatedly at military installations and personnel around the army's headquarters in Rawalpindi. An increase in deadly attacks on army convoys in the Pakistan-Afghanistan tribal areas has also pushed the army away from Musharraf.</p> <p>Though the army has reaped a financial windfall from US military aid, and has targeted many foreign militants allied with al-Qaida in the region, its performance against Pakistani militants has been mixed at best. Consequently, the prestige of the Taliban and other militant groups operating in the area has grown. In this context, the army, seeking to avoid sole responsibility for reverses, wants a popular government to take charge of policy. No such government can emerge if the elected parties are unseated. </p> <p>Nevertheless, there are signs of disagreement on important matters between the government and the army. The military recently blocked a government move to place Pakistan's infamous intelligence service, the ISI, under the control of the interior minister rather than the prime minister. Musharraf backed the military's opposition to this reform, gaining some gratitude from military commanders.</p> <p>During PM Yousaf Raza Gilani's recent visit to the US, President Bush repeatedly said that his administration supports Pakistan's democracy, a policy since reiterated by US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice. This indicates that the US will not back Musharraf in any confrontation between him and Pakistan's democratic forces. Most Pakistanis hope so.</p> <p>Musharraf must assess what will be his legacy. Rather than trying to face down impeachment and prolonging the crisis, he should recognise that Pakistan cannot afford more instability, and that giving up honourably will bring him some respect. </p> <p>For the sake of argument, even if Musharraf faces impeachment and by some stroke of luck is saved from being thrown out of office, his future will be bleak. In March 2009, the current ruling coalition will gain more seats in the Senate, and the government would almost certainly try to impeach him again. </p> <p>Moreover, any attempt by Musharraf to dislodge the government by using his constitutional authority would trigger another election, the results of which would not be much different from the vote in February. It is time for Musharraf's friends in the west to press him to serve his country one last time, by avoiding confrontation with his country's democratic forces and calling it quits. </p> <p>In cooperation with <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</p>",
