  "<p>Israel's police force has recommended that the prime minister, Ehud Olmert, be indicted for bribery, money laundering, fraud and breach of trust, following an 18-month investigation.</p> <p>Olmert is accused of receiving $150,000 (\u00a384,000) in cash for political campaigns over a 10-year period, accepting tens of thousands of dollars in upgraded air tickets and expensive hotel rooms and of double-billing Jewish philanthropic organisations, including Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust museum and the Soldiers' Welfare Fund, to the tune of $110,000.</p> <p>Police are also considering whether to recommend that Olmert be indicted for a third scandal, dubbed the investment centre affair, in which he, while serving as industry minister, allegedly granted state funds to a company represented by his close associate and former law partner, Uri Messer. </p> <p>Dogged by a string of corruption investigations, of which there have been five since he replaced Ariel Sharon as prime minister in 2006, Olmert announced in July that he would resign when his ruling party, Kadima, holds its primaries.</p> <p>The foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, is expected to replace Olmert as prime minister when the leadership ballot is held on September 17.</p> <p>However, polling suggests that Livni and her party will struggle to win at the next general election, which the Likud leader and former prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu is predicted to win.</p> <p>Olmert has repeatedly denied the allegations ever since they were made public on the eve of the country's 60th birthday celebrations earlier this year. </p> <p>Last night his lawyers issued a statement saying that the police recommendations were of \"no value\" because the attorney general, Menachem Mazuz, was required to assess the evidence and decide whether to lay charges.</p> <p>\"We will wait patiently for the decision of the attorney general. Unlike the police, he is aware of the heavy responsibility he holds,\" the statement said.</p> <p>But Mazuz is under growing public pressure to claim a political scalp, after he recently abandoned pursuing fraud and money laundering charges against the leader of the rightwing Yisrael Beiteinu party, Avigdor Lieberman, and jettisoned rape charges against Israel's former president, Moshe Katsav, to accept a plea bargain for a host of lesser sexual offences, which the accused subsequently rejected.</p> <p>On being appointed as attorney general, Mazuz initially took a tough stance against political corruption, but his credibility with the Israeli public withered after he dropped corruption charges against Olmert's predecessor, Sharon, who was also dogged by allegations of corruption.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Sharon's son, Omri began serving a seven month sentence for violating campaign finance laws, falsifying corporate documents and perjury in relation to the 1999 Likud elections.</p>",
  "<p>The Bush administration will brace itself this morning for a fresh round of adverse publicity with the appearance of the latest expos\u00e9 from the investigative reporter Bob Woodward that portrays the US government as being riddled with dissension over the Iraq war.</p> <p>Woodward's book, which goes on sale today, has already caused international ructions with its claims that the Bush administration had for years been spying on its Iraqi allies - the government of the prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, and his staff. The spying is alleged to have been much more than routine, including access to Iraqi government plans, manoeuvres and the secret actions of the prime minister. In the book, Woodward quotes one unnamed official who says: \"We know everything [Maliki] says.\"</p> <p>Such serious claims from one of America's best known and most respected journalists cannot easily be brushed aside, and have prompted outrage in Baghdad. Yesterday the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, responded indirectly to the allegations, telling reporters during a tour of North Africa: \"I can say that we have an open and political diplomatic relationship with the Iraqis that is cooperative.\"</p> <p>The War Within: a Secret White House History, 2006-2008, is the fourth volume in Woodward's detailed account of the Bush administration at war. In early volumes the author, who leaped to worldwide fame as one of the two reporters credited with breaking the 1970s Watergate scandal, was criticised for being soft on the president, but his stance has toughened with each new volume.</p> <p>Also likely to cause the administration considerable discomfort are passages in the book, printed in the Washington Post today, that suggest the government's strategy on the Iraq war at the height of the Sunni insurgency in 2006 was \"crippled by dissension among the president's advisers, delayed by political calculations and undermined by a widening and bitter rift in civilian-military relations\".</p> <p>With suicide bombings running at record levels, Woodward claims that Bush held the then commander of US forces in Iraq, George Casey, in such distrust that he circumvented the established chain of command and went behind his back to his eventual replacement, General David Petraeus. The suspicions were mutual, Woodward says. Casey regarded the president as one of the biggest problems in the conduct of the war. Casey confided to a colleague that he saw Bush as being from the \"radical wing of the Republican party that kept saying, 'Kill the bastards! Kill the bastards! And you'll succeed'\".</p> <p>The Woodward book comes as the latest in a long line of expos\u00e9s that have consistently caught the administration off balance. Earlier this year the former White House press secretary, Scott McClellan, published What Happened, in which he accused the president of self-deception.</p> <p>The criticisms of Bush present the president with a problem. On the one hand, he will want to secure his legacy as he leaves the White House. On the other hand, any comment made from the administration is certain to be injected into the intensifying presidential campaign, in which the Democrats are portraying the Republican candidate, John McCain, as another Bush.</p>",
  "<h2>I know it's wrong, but I find Sarah Palin's glasses utterly hypnotic. Am I mad?</h2> <p><strong>Michael Blake</strong>, London</p> <p>Absolutely not. My God, there is just soooooooo much to say about Sarah's glasses. As has already been mentioned in this paper by, um, me (this page's motto: if it's worth saying once, it's worth saying 10 times), they make her resemble Tina Fey, Will &amp; Grace's Megan Mullally and the stereotype of a sexy librarian. Mullally most of all, I feel. How I longed for her to make some really bitchy remark on the podium last week and start jumping up and clapping her hands, shrieking in delight with a camp man named Jack. </p> <p>So all of these resemblances give Palin a smack of familiarity when tales of moose stew and belief in creationism might make her seem unelectably exotic. </p> <p>But the most surprising celebrity lookalike connection with Palin reveals itself only when she takes off the specs. Look on YouTube at the footage of her taken when she worked as a (glasses-less) sportscaster in the 80s: the woman is the damn near spit of Britney Spears! Which gives our Sarah a bit of superhero potential, don't you think? In the day, she is a glasses-wearing hockey mom - but at night, she whips off those glasses and writhes around a pole in a ripped babydoll dress and sings about feeling a bit toxic. </p> <p>Hell, maybe she is Britney! </p> <p>After all, like Britney, she eloped in her youth, she is closely related to someone who went through a teenage pregnancy and there is a fondness for rednecks in her family. Perhaps this is going to be Palin's next revelation, after the pregnant daughter, the state investigation and being a fan of Alaskan separation: she is actually a former teenage pop star who once snogged Madonna. I can already hear the Republican party's defence: \"This is actually a great thing because Britney has been through a lot and come out the other side and, OK, yeah, her loser husband who goes by the laughable name of K-Fed was deemed to be a better parent than her, but she really knows the value of family. And she's not black.\"</p> <h2>What was Cindy McCain thinking at the convention? That outfit on the first day was completely inappropriate for her age.</h2> <p><strong>Ed Aston</strong>, by email</p> <p>I think the outfit's shocking ugliness is a more pressing factor, Ed, as opposed to so-called \"age appropriateness\", but we'll return to that in a tick. Seriously, folks - what was Cindy wearing? Was it a dress? Was it a coat? No! It was some weird mustard monstrosity that looked like a reject from some half-arsed period drama. </p> <p>On the one hand, I applaud Cindy's decision not even to try to compete with Michelle in the stylish-potential-first-lady stakes. (Incidentally, isn't it exciting how this election has coined so many new fashion terms? \"Michelle purple\", \"Hillary yellow\", \"Sarah Palin glasses\"? Forget about Vogue, just watch CNN.) On the other hand, I am utterly befuddled. Cindy is a stylish lady, if by stylish one means \"someone who usually matches her shoes to her skirt to her handbag to her coat\". In other words, she tends to give quite a lot of thought to her look. The stiffened bun, the face with so much makeup it appears to be immobile, the fawning looks to her freaky husband, the past drugs scandal - who needs Mad Men when we have Cindy? Such is her devotion to this \"Bree van de Kamp after rehab\" image that not even her husband allegedly telling her that she \"plaster[s] on makeup like a trollop, you [insert very bad word here]\" could dissuade her from the look. Yay Cindy! </p> <p>Which makes me wonder if there was method behind the mustard madness. As has been discussed in previous columns, Hillary Clinton had an unfortunate penchant for yellow. She lost (in case you needed a catch-up) and I don't think the two facts are disconnected. Is Cindy trying to sabotage her husband's campaign by resurrecting this cursed colour? Could she be plotting the greatest marital revenge since The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover? The woman was a Miss Junior Rodeo Queen - don't underestimate her.</p> <p>As to age appropriateness, well. The skirt is hardly short - her knees are barely visible. Are you, perchance, one of the handful who complained when Kirsty Wark dared to wear a knee-length skirt on Newsnight Review? Give me a break. She looks fine - not as fine as Kirsty (that's the mustard's fault, not the knees), but fine. There is an unfortunate schoolgirl element due to the A-line and pleats, but it's nothing too dodgy. I hold no truck with the idea of age-appropriateness. As long as the lady is comfortable and not just trying to wear youthful clothes in the misguided attempt to look younger, then it's fine. And Cindy looks as comfortable, as far as one can judge from that fixed smile. Of course, she is wrong to do so because that colour is totally bad-ass, but otherwise, I'm unbothered. And so, Ed, should you be.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Post questions to <strong>Ask Hadley</strong>, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER. email: <a href=\"mailto:ask.hadley@theguardian.com\">ask.hadley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Asif Ali Zardari will be sworn in tomorrow as Pakistan's president, following his election victory at the weekend, amid warnings from opposition voices that the country is in danger of a \"civilian dictatorship\" after the military rule of General Pervez Musharraf.</p> <p>Zardari inherits a country facing a deep economic and security crisis, where the hold of democracy is still fragile. The widower of the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto will have to reconcile the domestic unpopularity of the country's alliance with the west in the \"war against terror\" with international demands that Islamabad must do more to rein in extremists based in Pakistan's tribal territory, who threaten Nato's mission in Afghanistan.</p> <p>US attacks in the tribal area, especially an unprecedented ground assault last week, have raised angry demands that the country abandon \"America's war\".</p> <p>Few question the right of Zardari, 53, to be president, following his overwhelming election by an electoral college consisting of the parliament and regional assemblies, unlike Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 coup. But Zardari's ruthless reputation and the concentration of power in his hands have raised concern. As president and leader of the ruling Pakistan People's party, he will control government and parliament. As party boss, he chose the prime minister and can similarly dismiss him. The PPP controls three of the four provincial governments.</p> <p>Although Pakisan is supposed to have a parliamentary system, where the prime minister is chief executive, Musharraf ran the country under powers that Zardari will inherit. He also inherits a judiciary tamed by Musharraf. As president, Zardari will be immune from criminal charges.</p> <p>\"This is the real test,\" said Ahsan Iqbal, a leading member of Nawaz Sharif's party, which recently left the ruling coalition to become the biggest opposition group. \"The parliamentary system assumes the prime minister is the chief executive. But if the president is the fountainhead of power, that creates a logjam.\"</p> <p>After his election on Saturday, Zardari vowed to \"correct the imbalance\" between the presidency and the parliament, but did not say whether he would give up the leadership of the PPP. The president is by convention a non-party figure. \"Democracy talks, and everyone hears,\" Zardari said in a speech. \"To those who would say the PPP, or the presidency, would be controversial under our guardianship, I say, listen to democracy. Ninety-nine per cent of the people have spoken.\"</p> <p>Nisar Memon, a senator from the pro-Musharraf opposition party, said: \"They [the government] have been consolidating power, not addressing the real issues of the people. My fear is we are moving from military rule to a civilian dictatorship.\" The accusation Zardari seeks unchecked power is fuelled by his continued refusal to reinstate the chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, removed by Musharraf.</p>",
  "<p>The United States government last night announced the biggest financial bailout in the country's history, as it took the troubled American mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae into temporary public ownership to save them from collapse.</p> <p>In one of the most dramatic turns in the year-old credit crunch, the treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, said that the Federal Housing Finance Agency, formerly the regulator of the two companies, would run both businesses. Their current management has been replaced and further funds would be made available, he said.</p> <p>Fannie and Freddie account for half of all mortgages in the US. During the last year they have struggled to remain solvent, after bearing the brunt of the sub-prime crisis. The wider housing market was hit and hundreds of thousands of homeowners were forced to hand back the keys to their homes.</p> <p>Paulson, who had previously battled to prevent the Northern Rock-style government takeover of the lenders, said the world faced a severe setback in its attempts to deal with the credit crunch if the two institutions were allowed to fail. </p> <p>He said: \"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are so large and so interwoven in our financial system that a failure of either of them would cause great turmoil in our financial markets here at home and around the globe. This turmoil would directly and negatively impact household wealth.\"</p> <p>Paulson had briefed the US presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain at the weekend about the plan. McCain gave it his backing, but Obama said he would reserve judgment. \"We have to protect taxpayers and not bail out shareholders and management,\" he said. </p> <p>The plan received the full support of the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke. Freddie and Fannie have lent or underwritten about \u00a32.7 trn of the total \u00a36 trn of outstanding mortgage debt in the US. But the collapse in the housing market and surge in mortgage defaults meant the two groups racked up a combined $14bn of losses during the past year.</p>",

  "<p>The two main candidates for the US presidency locked horns yesterday over the credentials and qualities of Sarah Palin, the little-known governor of Alaska who has been propelled into the centre of the electoral battle with her appointment as John McCain's Republican running mate.</p> <p>As the race now fans out across America at the end of the two parties' national conventions, attention continues to focus on Palin, who has delighted the Christian right base of the Republican party but provoked criticism of her lack of experience, particularly in foreign affairs.</p> <p>Interviewed on politics programmes of the US networks yesterday, McCain and his Democratic opponent, Barack Obama, presented conflicting perspectives on Palin's politics and role in the election.</p> <p>Obama praised her as a skilled politician but rolled out his camp's new weapon - to depict her as a sort of McCain-Bush with brass knobs on. Obama said she was \"even more aligned with George Bush or Dick Cheney and the politics we've seen over the last eight years than John McCain himself\".</p> <p>Obama derided McCain's claim over the weekend that Palin had more foreign affairs experience than he had, by dint of the fact that her state lies next to Russia. \"I actually knew Alaska is next to Russia - I saw it on the map,\" Obama quipped.</p> <p>McCain, who came under heavy fire after he announced Palin as his vice-presidential candidate for picking a lightweight and failing to vet her properly, has been buoyed by her combative speech to his party's convention in Minnesota last week. \"She has a clear record of what Americans want uppermost - reform. She took on the people in her own party,\" said McCain. He characterised Palin's strength as \"taking them on and winning. I've taken them and won less than she has\".</p> <p>Despite the rapturous reception Palin received from the party faithful last week, Republican election strategists remain cautious about exposing her to the full force of the national media. Apart from a soft-soap window on her family life given to People magazine on the day she was selected, she has given no interviews. She will give her first TV interview to ABC later this week. </p> <p>McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, said: \"Why would we want to throw Sarah Palin into a cycle of piranhas called the news media that have nothing better to ask questions about than her personal life and her children? [Until] we feel like the news media is going to treat her with some level of respect and deference, I think it would be foolhardy to put her out into that kind of environment.\" </p> <p>The protective cordon has already caused tension. After a CNN presenter last week questioned a Palin aide over her national security experience, McCain pulled out of an interview with CNN's Larry King, saying the channel had gone \"over the line\". Yesterday Palin's Democratic counterpart, Senator Joe Biden, said: \"Eventually she's going to have to answer questions about her record.\"</p>",
  "<p>Last Friday, John McCain and Sarah Palin hit the campaign trail together for the first time as an official ticket, as Palin pledged her loyalty to \"small-town America\" in the Republican stronghold of Cedarburg, Wisconsin, population 11,000.</p> <p>That same day, the federal government released its monthly jobs report. The unemployment rate stood at 6.1%, the highest it's been in nearly five years. The American economy has lost 605,000 jobs this year. It's an economy, it bears remembering, that needs to add about 150,000 jobs each month just to keep pace with the growing workforce.</p> <p>McCain's addition of Palin to the Grand Old Party ticket has stoked up the conservative base, and her rhetoric will ensure that the campaign returns to familiar attack themes about Democrats being elitists and sneering at small-town values. Meanwhile, many actual small towns are losing jobs, and the party in power has done little about it.</p> <p>The party in power, of course, usually pays the price for a lousy economy. But we know also that Republicans have used the above themes successfully in recent elections. Will they work again? They just might. After all, they pack quite an emotional punch. But there are reasons to think that this time they might not. To understand why, step with me into the wayback machine.</p> <p>The American cultural divide has always existed, but in its present form it dates from the 1960s, when some conservative politicians figured out how to exploit liberalism's support for minorities and other contentious causes. George Wallace, the segregationist Alabama governor, did it superbly. But no one was better at it than Richard Nixon. </p> <p>As author Rick Perlstein argues in his book Nixonland, Nixon took all this personally. At his college, there was a society that dubbed itself the Franklins - well-heeled, urbane and mostly liberal. He started his own society called the Orthogonians (a Latin portmanteau meaning, basically, \"straight shooters\"). These were the unfashionable students, whose chief rallying tenet was resentment of the Franklins. When he attained power, Nixon did his best to divide the country into Franklins and Orthogonians. Our \"blue\" and \"red\" Americas are, in essence, these two groups.</p> <p>But here's the crucial point. Not everyone is a Franklin or an Orthogonian. Indeed, most Americans aren't particularly political. They're more interested in Brangelina or the new NFL season. They vote on two bases: their instinct about the candidates and their immediate condition in life. Orthogonian rhetoric usually works well with these folks. They don't spend their lives hating liberals because they don't care enough to hate, but most of them can be persuaded that Democrats are going to raise their taxes and banish God from the public sphere, because, after all, Democrats have contempt for them and their values.</p> <p>It worked for Ronald Reagan, who was running against a weak incumbent Democrat against whom a clear and comprehensive case could be made. It worked in 1988 for George HW Bush, who faced an opponent who didn't know how to stand up and fight for himself. It worked in 2000 and 2004 for George W Bush, whose opponents were easily tagged as elitist and who did nothing to fight the charge. The two times it didn't work? For Bush Sr in 1992, when he was the incumbent and the economy was bad. And for Bob Dole in 1996, when Bill Clinton was the incumbent and overseeing a strong economy.</p> <p>What about this year? Something is true that has not been true in any election going all the way back to 1980. This year, 80% of Americans think the country is seriously on the wrong track. Four out of five adults. Excepting the most hardcore Bush supporters, that's pretty much every adult in the country. Sure, a smattering of that 80% thinks the country's on the wrong track because it isn't conservative enough. But the majority is concerned about the usual things: the economy, the lack of good healthcare, America's terrible standing in the world, and a host of other maladies.</p> <p>The Democratic wager, then, is this: that most of the people in the vast uncommitted middle will not renew their Orthogonian membership cards. So far, the theory appears to hold water. McCain and Palin found a safely Republican town to visit in Wisconsin. But, as of today, Obama and Biden are eight points ahead in that state - a state John Kerry won by just 10,000 votes.</p> <p>How will Palin, an uber-Orthogonian, play in such an atmosphere? Early polling returns are not encouraging for the GOP. In two focus groups, independents came away decidedly underwhelmed. One typical comment: \"She is a cool, poised speaker, but her speech contained few statements about policy or the party platform ... I am not convinced that Palin's experience as a mayor or governor in Alaska meet the qualifications to be vice-president.\"</p> <p>In normal times, Republicans win culture-war arguments. But these aren't normal times. The Democrats have to run a smart campaign: they must answer every attack and lodge several of their own, firmly tying McCain-Palin to the Bush-Cheney economic policy. If they do it well, a majority of independents should join the Franklin club this time.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Michael Tomasky is editor of Guardian America <a href=\"mailto:michael.tomasky@theguardian.com\">michael.tomasky@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Forget labels. In reality, two giant parties struggle perennially for power in Pakistan. One is the politicians' party, whose candidate, Asif Ali Zardari, has just been elected president. The other is the army party, which prefers bazookas to ballot boxes. Democracy in this pivotal country is a frail blossom. And Zardari is as frail as they come.</p> <p>The crude apology for a party system in Pakistan is 60 years old and shows scant sign of changing. First, the politicians have an election and govern for a while. When they falter, the generals take over. Ayub Khan, Yahya Khan, Zia ul-Haq, Pervez Musharraf - they come and go, punctuated briefly by elected prime ministers (mostly called Bhutto). It's a malign sort of game, growing perilously close to an endgame now. Indeed, President Zardari's inevitably brief tenure may well be the end of it all as a third party - young, idealistic, fervent and brave - begins to tip the board over. You may not have heard the Taliban so described before, but that doesn't mean that brute force isn't with them.</p> <p>In the wake of Benazir Bhutto's murder by hands unknown last December, the Pakistan People's party had a triumphant election. It possessed just enough numbers in the national and provincial parliaments to deliver the presidency, but you'd be hard pressed to invent a more hopeless, doomed prospectus.</p> <p>This president isn't a politician. He's a businessmen who's been haplessly entangled in too much monkey business over the years. Nine years in prison for corruption on trumped-up charges? Perhaps they have never been fully, fairly investigated, but to too many Pakistanis he is Mr Ten Per Cent. He vows to fight against the Taliban and defend US interests, even when they include US special forces staging bloody raids inside Pakistan's borders. He promises to put right a broken, increasingly beleaguered economy, and to spend another $15bn of American aid wisely and well. But what comes next will be failure, unpopularity and a new tide of sleaze allegations. </p> <p>A year or two down the line, the men in braid will sense a familiar opportunity and mount another coup. Washington, glad to have the military back at the top, will find another $15bn. The army will buy more guns, and feed more of its private bank accounts. The looting of Pakistan's hope and Pakistan's future will proceed on schedule.</p> <p>The twin supposed champions of democracy - Zardari and Nawaz Sharif - couldn't have made a lousier fist of the past eight months: any sense of national interest was lost immediately in an orgy of squabbling. The governing party couldn't have chosen a worse candidate for commander in chief (retaining most of Musharraf's powers). And Nato's American leadership, insisting increasingly shrilly that feebleness in Islamabad will give Waziristan's cross-border invaders free rein in Afghanistan, couldn't be hastening the demise of democracy more idiotically. </p> <p>Zardari announced his arrival - to the Washington Post - as a warrior from Sind bent on destroying the \"Lahore-Islamabad oligarchy\". The oligarchs scheduled for destruction are Sharif and a military top brass trapped between a new leadership they despise and a religious insurrection that is beginning to dismember the nation. </p> <p>Yet the Taliban, whom the generals must defeat to get America's billions, are much more than a gang of terrorist thugs. They are also a madcap reform movement of young men disgusted by corruption and the godless wheeler-dealers they think have drained the purity out of Jinnah's \"pure state\", and the success they're experiencing in the borderlands and beyond shows that many ordinary Pakistanis agree with them. It's a battle for hearts and minds and, on his record, Asif Ali Zardari is the predestined loser of last resort.<br><a href=\"mailto:p.preston@theguardian.com\"><br>p.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",

If you find someone who worked briefly as a teacher, in the media or the law, you can now count yourself lucky.</p> <p>For most of those who inhabit the Westminster village, politics was an early career choice, and that in itself may have been a bad decision.

They went to drink warm white wine at political lectures, seminars and conferences, wrote speeches for older politicians, then dug up facts for them, then dug up policies, found a seat and rose without bubbles or much kicking.</p> <p>Hemmed in by the limits defined for them in opinion polls and focus groups, their language is a relentless rehashing of phrases and metaphors.

There are all the 80s and 90s phrases about community, third way, \"ordinary decent people\", firmness and vision. Sometimes I close my eyes and it swirls around in a blur, like faded towels in the washing machine. They talk about voters and constituents, but they never, ever sound like them.</p> <p>Nor do the mavericks. Boris has the talent to deliver bad news, to make mistakes and gaffes - and still to be forgiven, even loved, for it. He hasn't hidden his posh accent or pretended to be in any way normal. He's climbed higher and faster than better-behaved, blander, more conventional Tories. Ken Livingstone thrived for eight years as London mayor for similar reasons. You never quite knew what he was going to say. Nor did his advisers.</p> <p>Goldsmith, another posh Tory, supports environmental protesters and is clearly not going to toe the Cameron line if his leader backs away from green issues. He, too, has a scent of the unfamiliar. Lucas, the newly crowned Green party leader, can say what she thinks because she is outside the mainstream party system.</p> <p>So the Palin phenomenon is not new and it's not surprising. You don't have to approve of anything about the woman to find her interesting. My guess, and hope, is that over the next few weeks, as floating voters in the US realise that they are supposed to be electing a president, her loopy Alaska-first and creationist views and her extreme social conservatism will start to scare them off. What she has done, though, is to look and speak differently. The \"hockey mom\" stuff is a distraction. She is not mainstream or normal. But she does seem unpredictable, a new actor on the stage still be to properly understood, and that is addictive. No wonder John McCain is trying to cash in on her success by styling himself as a \"maverick\" too.</p> <p>Obama was the outsider during the earlier stages of presidential campaigning - not fully understood, with a casual style, surprising personal story and way with words unlike ordinary candidates. Now, with the ultimate prize near, he seems to have stiffened and disciplined himself so effectively that Palin can paint him as somehow an insider. </p> <p>All politicians face the Obama dilemma. Voters want to be interested, surprised, challenged and amused - this is an entertainment culture. But we don't want loopy-loo policies as a result. We will cut people slack if they amuse us or engage us emotionally, as Boris Johnson has proved. But we want the sums to add up, the streets to be clean and the advisers to be decent.</p> <p>Boris aside, this is one area where the Tories are in just as much of a pickle as Labour or the Lib Dems. They are popular because the government is so hated. But look at their front bench - all those dark suits, rich lifestyles, timid talking, follow-my-leader clones - and ask how long we'll still like them in power.</p> <p>What is needed is the arrival in the Commons of people who have not learned professional politics, have never served as advisers and have no idea what Populus means. Local parties need to start taking risks - I'm not talking about quotas but about sparky individuals, with the odd skeleton, the occasional surprising view. The media has to celebrate different voices and faces where they appear, and not pick on every unexpected remark as a \"gaffe\". For all that the mainstream media seized on Alastair Darling's pessimistic assessment of the economy as a stupendous own goal, the general public seem to like the fact he \"told the truth\".</p> <p>The government is in a deep hole, but politics is in a worse one. A democracy is meant to be about the voices of the people - who may be raucous or rude but are preferable to a closed, monkish order of nodding heads. When a party picks its next candidate, or a leader looks for someone to promote, they should remember a new rule: the safe option has become the dangerous one.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jackie.ashely@theguardian.com\">jackie.ashely@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The US government today announced the biggest financial bailout in the country's history as it took troubled mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae into temporary public ownership to save them from collapse.</p> <p>The US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, said the Federal Housing Finance Agency, hitherto the two companies' regulator, would henceforth run the companies in a state of \"conservatorship\" and the two chief executives would be replaced by new men.</p> <p>Paulson had briefed presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain over the weekend about the plan. McCain gave it his immediate backing but Obama said he would reserve judgment until he saw further details, adding that determining the future of the companies would be a top priority if he won the White House.</p> <p>\"We have to protect taxpayers and not bail out the shareholders and management,\" he said.</p> <p>The plan received the full backing of the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, and financial markets appeared likely to be cheered by the news. The move helped put a prop under one part of the financial system that had been looking particularly shaky for several months.</p> <p>Rumours of the move on Friday were sufficient to push shares up on Wall Street after the London stock markets had ended a bad week by shedding another 2.25% to close at 5,240.7.</p> <p>The US government was forced to announce a plan to prop up the finances of the troubled mortgage giants in July. Paulson said then that Washington would buy up shares in the two companies and underwrite their ballooning debt, which has risen to around $800bn (\u00a3452bn) each. Congress at the time approved lending unlimited amounts to the two companies or taking a stake in them if they ran into real trouble.</p> <p>The two companies have lent or underwritten about $5.3 trillion of the total $12tn of outstanding mortgage debt in the United States. Freddie and Fannie have long been considered as being too big to be allowed to fail.</p> <p>The collapse in the housing market and surge in mortgage defaults meant the two groups racked up a combined $14bn of losses over the past year.</p> <p>Although there are increasing signs from the US that house prices are stabilising after falling for two to three years, many analysts say the housing market's problems are far from over.</p> <p>\"Mortgage delinquencies continue to set new records, promising more losses and future write-offs for banks and other mortgage lenders,\" said economists at investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort.</p> <p>\"The problems are spreading from the subprime sector to prime loans, particularly to mortgages with adjustable rates and optional payment features. With unemployment rising faster, cyclical problems will now compound the damage caused by falling house prices.\"</p>",
  "<p>Once again, Britain trade unions can help save \u2013 or help destroy \u2013 Labour as a party fit for government. In the 1930s, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Bevin\">Ernest Bevin</a> saved the Labour party from wandering off into the irrelevance of non-intervention in Spain and thinking that a peace pledge petition would stop Hitler from annexing German-speaking parts of Czechoslovakia.</p> <p>Bevin, after 1945, dragged Labour away from a fatal embrace with Stalinism and, instead, created Nato, the Marshall plan, and despite being howled down by the left at the Labour party conference because union demands for inflationary pay rises could not be met, he kept Labour as a mainstream party fit for power.</p> <p>In contrast, the roaring TUC denunciations of Jim Callaghan's government in the 1970s, and the unleashing of the winter of discontent in 1978-79, helped bring back the Tories. The TUC's language in the early 1980s \u2013 anti-Europe, anti-America, anti-economic reform, anti-everything \u2013 helped hand Thatcher her victories in 1983 and 1987.</p> <p>Fast forward to the late 1980s and early 1990s and brave union leaders like Bill Morris, Bill Jordan and John Monks took Labour out of the clutches of Scargillism, or of those who claimed that bringing Japanese car factories to the north east meant importing \"alien practices\" (called jobs) to the UK. Former Communist leaders of genius like the AEU's Jimmy Airlie understood it was time to park the militant rhetoric of denunciation of Labour and, instead, forge a new alliance with reformist, modernising Blair-Brown politics.</p> <p>Again, its was the trade union leaders who saved Labour, broke the back of Stalinist control and Trotskyist infiltration of trade unions and local Labour party organisation.</p> <p>Today, the Tories are coming back, the BNP is growing, but some TUC leaders <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/07/labourleadership.ordonbrown&quot;\">reserve their fire</a> for Labour. This is forward to the past. Not to the past of an Ernie Bevin, or the Morris-Monks-Jordan alliance, which helped defeat the Tories, but to the past of the 1970s and early 1980s, in which Labour was denounced by trade unions. Trade union leaders <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/07/tradeunions.labour\">are queuing up</a> to dig the grave of a Labour government.</p> <p>This is possibly the last TUC congress before a general election, and certainly the last but one before an election in 2010. This might be the moment to celebrate the massive reallocation of resources under Labour in favour of working people, which has seen not only 900,000 more workers join the public sector, but also British industry take a bigger share of GDP than industry in France. Plus a raft of social justice measures from the minimum wage to five weeks' paid holiday and every ministry with open doors to trade union delegations.</p> <p>But no. The language is full of hate and anger. Derek Simpson, the Unite joint leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/07/tradeunions.labour\">even tells</a> the Observer, \"We might as well elect Cameron.\" Did I read that right? It was in the midst of a stream of abuse against David Miliband. In Moscow, Miliband is denounced as a \"Jew\". For Simpson, he is \"smug\" and \"arrogant\".</p> <p>As far as I know, poor Mr Miliband has not said a word about unions in recent times, though \u2013 unlike Tory foreign secretaries \u2013 he has invited TUC leaders to dinner and gone to see them at Congress House.</p> <p>It is not clear what provoked Simpson's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Vyshinsky \">Vyshinsky</a>-style abuse against our foreign secretary. But for a senior labour movement leader, this use of language about one of our top ministers is worrying and serious. David Miliband <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jFj5byJOCsrma8hRzhkSa-RrY6VA \">is engaged</a> in serious international business at the moment over Russia's invasion and part-annexation of Georgia as well as difficulties in Pakistan and the anger of Kashmiris in the Indian-occupied part of Kashmir. There is a tricky UN general assembly to deal with.</p> <p>When Ernest Bevin was seeking to promote a post 1945 settlement based on Labour values, he told conference delegates not \"to stab me in the back\".</p> <p>Miliband would be foolish to rise to Simpson's abuse; the quickest way Labour can lose the next election is to indulge in this kind of name-calling at the highest level. It makes Labour look quarrelsome, riven by personality conflicts, and obsessed with itself. It is a one-way ticket to defeat and oblivion \u2013 and TUC leaders should not be punching it.</p> <p>Every Labour MP and union branch official knows the difficulties our people are going through. I spent time with union branch officials at my local hospital last week, and three of them said the problem was there were too many foreigners or immigrants in Rotherham. Not true, but a shudder of fear and cold went through my heart that union representatives could use this BNP language. We had a friendly talk and I hope I persuaded them that Britain has been made by different people from different regions with different religions and different tongues coming to live here.</p> <p>But then I switched on the BBC R4 news on Saturday night and a woman union leader was ranting with hate against energy companies. As it happens, there is a good case for a windfall tax and it got Gordon Brown's chancellorship off to a cracking start in 1997. The Tories imposed windfall taxes and President Sarkozy has just imposed a tax on unearned income for France's middle classes in order to pay for his version of the working families tax credit.</p> <p>But the case will be made not with roaring student union rhetoric and abuse of companies, but by the kind of rational expose advanced by the Tory-controlled Local Government Association. Every MP, every union official and every citizen has his or her ideas of what the government should do. The call is for change \u2013 as if there were off-the-shelf policies that could stop the global economic crisis of rising costs of fuel, food and credit, which is hitting every democratic nation hard. But an honest union leadership would have to explain, as did an earlier generation of union leaders who helped Labour defeat the Tories that, with the state taking 45% of the GDP in revenue and with massive commitment to pay for extra teachers, nurses, public service delivery and still keep taxes at a level that does not produce voter revolt, the room for Labour's manoeuvre is limited. But where are the calm voices of reason to be heard at the TUC?</p> <p>Unions in Britain, in Europe, in North America, everywhere, are losing members as they continue structures, organisation and leadership based on 20th-century industrial society models. They are more than ever needed, as capitalism explodes across the planet at a speed far ahead of that which society and politics can keep up with.</p> <p>But unions need a government that at least is prepared to listen to them. Right now, too much of the rhetoric at the TUC puts Labour up as the main enemy to be defeated. Abuse of the foreign secretary \u2013 or any minister and the prime minister \u2013 is Christmas squared to the Tories (as they cheerfully admit). In the past, trade unions helped save Labour. Today, they appear to want to bury the party they founded.</p>",
  "<p>So, this is it then. This could be our very last weekend. For all of us. Next Wednesday, we will all disappear down a black hole. Humanity will cease. The Earth will cease. The solar system will cease. Well, not in its current form or dimension, anyway.</p> <p>Even though the atom-smashing physicists at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/cern\">Cern mega-laboratory</a> in Switzerland who are preparing to crank up the most audacious and expensive experiment in history insist that the chances of anything going wrong are \"infinitesimally small\", there is still a small band of doubters out there who <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2008/09/05/scilhc105.xml\">fear the worst </a>. But despite their best efforts \u2013 which include two failed legal challenges \u2013 to avert what they believe will be a galactic catastrophe triggered by the experiment, the big lever will nonetheless be pulled on Wednesday and the atom smashing will commence.</p> <p>For people such as me, who struggled to understand the back cover of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/sep/27/scienceandnature.highereducationprofile\">A Brief History of Time</a> and therefore don't know my <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson\">Higgs bosons</a> from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon\">my gluons</a>, it's time to take a giant leap of faith. We have to accept that this expert band of physicists gathered from around the world know exactly what they are doing. I'm extremely confident they do \u2013 they've double, triple checked their calculations, right? \u2013 but there's still a teeny part of me that wonders, what if?</p> <p>If the thought of the <a href=\"http://lhc.web.cern.ch/lhc/\">Large Hadron Collider</a> being fired up on Wednesday for the first time leaves you, albeit irrationally, a tad unsettled, too, then wonder what it will be like for those real doubters over the next few days. What do you do when you have a firm appointment in your diary that simply says \"End of World\"?</p> <p>Personally, I think I would have a to-do list prepared. <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-freeman26-2008aug26,0,639371.story\">Dave Freeman</a>, the co-author of the best-selling \"100 Things to Do Before You Die\", recently died aged 47 following a fall at his home in California. But, despite his early death, he had already completed half of the things on his list, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/07/spain.animalwelfare\">running with the bulls in Pamplona</a>. He was the definitive \"man with a plan\". I like that attitude.</p> <p>But there would be little point in putting too many fanciful things on your list, such as \"skydiving from 15,000ft\" or \"swimming with dolphins\". Let's just run through some of the things that would happen if a date was announced for the end of the world, say, because an asteroid was heading our way and couldn't be stopped, even by a select group of Hollywood action heroes. All systems and services would surely fail within a matter of hours. After all, who's going to bother going to work upon being told such dramatic news, especially if it's imminent?</p> <p>I'm torn between thinking that we would all run around screaming and looting, or simply be becalmed by the news and enter into a collective group hug. If history has taught us anything, it would suggest that the former is far more likely, but then again what's the point of smashing the windows of an electronics store and stealing a 42\" plasma screen television, if you have just a few days left? Is watching reruns of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/onlyfools/\">Only Fools and Horses</a>, or playing <a href=\"http://www.mariokart.com/wii/launch/\">Mario Kart Wii</a> (10), really the best use of your time? Most of us, once realising the game was up, would probably retreat to our homes and do things such as flick through our photo albums, listen to favourite albums, and comfort eat our way through whatever food was available. After all, who's going to be worrying about calories?</p> <p>In fact, just think of those other fleeting benefits \u2013 no worrying about a recession, no worrying about climate change, and no worrying about coming up with a witty Facebook status update every few hours. And think, too, of all those things we'd never know the answer to: would Obama have defeated McCain? Which cabinet member started the revolt against Gordon Brown? Where was Bin Laden hiding? Would Liverpool have ever won the Premiership? Who would have won Big Brother? (Actually, I'm prepared to be vaporised without knowing the answer to this one, but it does raise an intriguing issue: should we tell the people in the Big Brother house about the bad news, or leave them in blissful ignorance?)</p> <p>And then there's the ultimate unanswered question: does God exist? How would religion fit into this end-of-the-world scenario? (Presumably, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture\">the Rapturists</a> would be thrilled?) Would people flock to their nearest church, mosque, synagogue or temple seeking salvation? Or would people feel abandoned by their god(s)?</p> <p>But I feel there's a more compelling question: what do you do when you wake up bleary eyed on Thursday and everything is still there? The world has survived, after all. What have all those people in the past done when their end-of-the-world predictions haven't, in fact, proved to be true? Are they pleased, depressed, or do they just feel a little bit silly? I've been asked on a number of occasions how I would feel if climate change, for example, was proved somehow to be false. Bloody relieved is the honest answer. But, as with what's about to take place at Cern, I trust that the thousands of scientists involved have reached a sensible conclusion about the likely threat to humanity.</p>",
  "<p>The death toll in a massive suicide blast in Pakistan's north-west reached 35, officials said today, as the country prepared for the widower of the former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, to take over as president.</p> <p>The attack yesterday demonstrated the severe militant threat facing the Muslim nation and president-elect Asif Ali Zardari, who overwhelmingly won MPs' votes the same day as the blast and was expected to be sworn in by Tuesday.</p> <p>Zardari has vowed to be tough on militancy, a stance that plays well in Washington which has pushed Pakistan to clamp down on extremist havens along its borders.</p> <p>Zardari has a fine line to walk. Coming down too hard on insurgent activity risks inflaming Pakistani public opinion and even a tribal uprising. But he also faces pressure from opponents to reduce the powers of the presidency, which he and his party have vowed to do.</p> <p> Ahsan Iqbal, a spokesman for the chief opposition party, told Dawn News Television that Zardari's election was simply a stop along the way to restoring full democracy in Pakistan, and that the transition required giving up some of the president's powers.</p> <p>The president has the power to dissolve parliament and appoint army chiefs, and chairs the joint civilian-military committee that controls Pakistan's nuclear weapons.</p> <p>\"Parliament is sovereign,\" Zardari told a group of well-wishers on Saturday. \"This president shall be subservient to the parliament.\"</p> <p>Dozens were wounded in Saturday's attack, in which an explosives-packed pick-up truck blew up at a police checkpoint on the outskirts of Peshawar in the north-west. Police said a huge amount of explosives was used in the blast, signalling that the attacker might have been aiming for a more important target.</p> <p>Television footage showed a blast crater 3 feet (1 metre) deep, destroyed vehicles and pieces of debris scattered across a large area. Some buildings in a nearby market collapsed, leading civilians to dig frantically with their hands to find survivors.</p> <p>A teacher and school guard were among the five dead newly recovered from the rubble, police official Rashid Khan said.</p> <p>The Election Commission said today that Zardari's win had been certified. His aides said he could be sworn in within a couple of days.</p> <p>Newspaper editorials marking Zardari's ascent noted that a recent US-led ground assault in a tribal region along the Afghan border signalled American impatience with Pakistan's progress in battling insurgents.</p> <p>Far from being confident, however, the opinion pieces warned that Zardari is yet unproven and still tainted by a history of corruption allegations.</p> <p>\"What Mr Zardari needs to do is to dispel the impression that he is a political wheeler-dealer who is adept at making back-room deals but unable to rise to the requirements of statesmanship,\" said an editorial in Dawn, a leading English-language newspaper.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/05/pakistan.zardari\">Asif Ali Zardari</a> \u2013 singled out by fate to become Benazir Bhutto's husband and who, subsequently, did everything he could to prevent himself from being returned to obscurity \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/07/pakistan.zardari.election\">is about to become</a> the new President of Pakistan. Oily-mouthed hangers-on, never in short supply in Pakistan, will orchestrate a few celebratory shows and the ready tongues of old cronies (some now appointed ambassadors to western capitals) will speak of how democracy has been enhanced. Zardari's close circle of friends, with whom he shared the spoils of power the last time around and who have remained loyal, refusing all inducements to turn state's evidence in the corrruption cases against him, will also be delighted. Small wonder then that definitions of democracy in Pakistan differ from person to person.<br>There will be no expressions of joy on the streets to mark <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/17/pakistan\">the transference of power</a> from a moth-eaten general to a worm-eaten politician. The affection felt in some quarters for the Bhutto family is non-transferable. If Benazir were still alive, Zardari would not have been given any official post. She had been considering two other senior politicians for the presidency. Had she been more democratically inclined she would never have treated her political party so scornfully, reducing it to the status of a family heirloom, bequeathed to her son, with her husband as the regent till the boy came of age. </p> <p>This, and this alone, has aided Zardari's rise to the top. He was disliked by many of his wife's closest supporters in the People's Party (or the Bhutto Family Party, as it is referred to by disaffected members) even when she was alive. They blamed his greed and godfatherish behaviour to explain her fall from power on two previous occasions, which I always thought was slightly unfair. She knew. It was a joint enterprise. She was never one to regard politics alone as the consuming passion of her life and always envied the lifestyle and social behaviour of the very rich. And he was shameless in his endeavours to achieve that status. </p> <p>Today, he is the second richest person in the country, with estates and bank accounts littered on many continents, including a mansion in Surrey worth several million. Many of Benazir's inner circle, sidelined by the new boss (Zardari did rub their noses in excrement by having his apolitical sister elected from Larkana, hitherto a pocket borough of the Bhutto family) actively hate him. Benazir's uncle, Mumtaz Bhutto (head of the clan) has sharply denounced him. Some even encourage the grotesque view that he was in some way responsible for her death. This is foolish. He is only trying to fulfill her legacy. He was certainly charged with ordering the murder of his brother-in-law, Murtaza Bhutto, when Benazir was prime minister, but the case was never tried. Characteristically, one of Zardari's first acts after his party's victory in the February polls was to appoint <a href=\"http://www.pakspectator.com/who-is-dr-shoaib-suddle-and-tariq-lodhi/\">Shoaib Suddle</a>, the senior police officer connected to the Murtaza Bhutto ambush and killing, as the boss of the Federal Intelligence Agency. Loyalty is always repaid in full. </p> <p>In the country at large, his standing, always low, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/06/pakistan1\">has sunk still further</a>. The majority of Pakistan's 190 million citizens may be poor, illiterate or semi-literate, but their instincts are usually sound. An opinion poll carried out by the <a href=\"http://www.newamerica.net/issues/keywords/pakistan\">New America Foundation</a> some months ago revealed Zardari's approval ratings at a low ebb \u2013 less than 14%. These figures confirm the view that he is the worst possible slice of Pakistan's crumbly nationhood. The people has had no say in his election. parliamentary cabals have already determined the result. I do not take too seriously the recent revelation that a psychiatrist had pronounced him suffering from acute dementia, incapable of recognising his children due to a chronic loss of memory. This was, as is known, designed for the courtroom had he been prosecuted in London or Geneva for large-scale money-laundering and corruption. All that is in abeyance now, since he has been elevated into a crucial figure in the \"war on terror\". </p> <p>A small mystery remained. Why did the US suddenly withdraw support from General Musharraf? An answer <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/26/washington/26diplo.html?_r=1&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=Helene%20Cooper%20and%20Mark%20Mazzetti&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin\">was provided</a> on August 26 by Helene Cooper and Mark Mazzetti in the New York Times. The State Department, according to this report, was not in favour of an undignified and hasty departure, but unknown to them a hardcore neocon faction led by Zalmay Khalilzad, the US ambassador to the Security Council, was busy advising Asif Zardari in secret and helping him plan the campaign to oust the general:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Mr Khalilzad had spoken by telephone with Mr Zardari, the leader of the Pakistan Peoples party, several times a week for the past month until he was confronted about the unauthorised contacts, a senior United States official said, \"Can I ask what sort of 'advice and help' you are providing?\" \u2026 Mr. Boucher wrote in an angry email message to Mr Khalilzad. \"What sort of channel is this? Governmental, private, personal?\" Copies of the message were sent to others at the highest levels of the State Department; the message was provided to the New York Times by an administration official who had received a copy.\" </p> </blockquote> <p><br> Khalilzad is an inveterate factionalist and a master of intrigue. Having implanted Hamid Karzai in Kabul (with dire results as many in Washington now admit), he had been livid with Musharraf for refusing to give 100% support to his Afghan protege. Khalilzad now saw an opportunity to punish Musharraf and simultaneously try and create a Pakistani equivalent of Karzai. </p> <p>Zardari fitted the bill. He is perfectly suited to being a total creature of Washington. The Swiss government helpfully decided to release millions of dollars from Zardari's bank accounts that had, till now, been frozen due to the pending corruption cases. Like his late wife, Zardari, too, is now being laundered, just like the money he made when last in office as minister for investment. This weakness will make him a pliant president of Pakistan. </p> <p>The majority of the population is deeply hostile to the US/Nato presence in Afghanistan. Almost 80% favour a negotiated settlement and withdrawal of all foreign troops. Three days ago, a team of US commandos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/05/pakistan.usa\">entered Pakistan</a> \"in search of terrorists\" and 20 innocents were killed. Zardari was being tested. But if he permits US troops to enter the frontier province on \"search-and-destroy\" missions his career will be short-lived and the military will return in some shape or form. The High Command cannot afford to ignore the growing anger within its junior ranks at being forced to kill their own people.</p> <p>The president of Pakistan was designed in the 1972 constitution as an ornamental figure. Military dictators subverted and altered the constitution to their advantage. Will Zardari revert to his late father-in-law's constitution or preserve its existing powers? </p> <p>The country desperately needs a president capable of exercizing some moral authority and serving as the conscience of the country. The banished chief justice, Iftikhar Chaudhry, automatically comes to mind, as do the figures of Imran Khan and IA Rehman (the chairman of the Human Rights Commission), but the governing elite and its self-serving backers in Washington have always been blind to the real needs of this country. They should be careful. The sparks flying across the Afghan border might ignite a fire that is difficult to control.</p> <p><em>Tariq Ali's latest book, The Duel: Pakistan on the Flightpath of American Power, will be published by Simon and Schuster on September 15</em></p>"
