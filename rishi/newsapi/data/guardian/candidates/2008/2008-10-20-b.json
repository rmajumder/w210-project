These are perilous times, he says, but he urges them not to despair.</p> <p>\"There are still two weeks before the election,\" he says, before announcing a week of fasting and prayer in the run-up to polling day.</p> <p>For conservative Christians, such as Holt and his congregation, the prospect of a Democratic victory represents sheer calamity. Yet Evangelicals have not been natural supporters of John McCain, doubting the Republican's commitment to banning abortion and gay marriage.</p> <p>But conservative Christians believe a Barack Obama presidency would roll back a generation of political gains which culminated with their privileged position in George Bush's White House. </p> <p>\"I don't think we are going to have any influence with Barack Obama in the White House,\" Holt told the Guardian. </p> <p>The election represented a paradigm shift for the US as well as for evangelicals. \"I think there is a backlash against Bush because of the economy and I think frankly because of a lack of leadership,\" Holt said. \"There is a sense we are in a position of weakness right now.\"</p> <p>A political forum at the church saw bewilderment and frustration among members of Holt's flock as they tried to come to terms with Obama's widening lead over McCain - and the potential loss of their power in Washington.</p> <p>\"Has Obama through mass hypnosis figured out a way to bypass the critical faculties of all Americans?\" asked Brian Sherman, a church volunteer.</p> <p>Mark Andre, a commodities trader, said he had not started out a supporter of McCain - though the senator was well liked by his Democratic friends before the campaign. \"It's almost like Democrats became hateful of McCain. Has it been Sarah Palin and her stance, or is it just Obama and his ideology? What happened to all the Democrats who loved McCain?\"</p> <p>Political soul-searching is under way at conservative churches across the US - but nowhere more so than Colorado Springs, a town known locally as the \"evangelical mecca\". </p> <p>Local government officials lured conservative Christian groups here with tax breaks in the 1980s. Colorado Springs is now headquarters for the most powerful Christian organisations in the US.</p> <p>The town and surrounding areas remain defiantly conservative in a state that has been leaning Democratic in state elections for the last four years since voting Bush in 2000 and 2004. John Morris, the chairman of the county Democratic party, called the town \"a black hole of Republican extremism\".</p> <p>Colorado is now emerging as a key battleground state, and Republicans are counting on the evangelicals to help McCain hang on. The party has sent emissaries to 400 churches over the past few days to recruit volunteers for \"evangelical-to-evangelical\" phone banks. It has also used the churches to generate excitement about Palin's rally schedule yesterday, handing out tickets after morning services on Sunday.</p> <p>In an ordinary election that grassroots organisation would make a difference. Evangelicals consider it a \"Christian duty\" to vote. Past elections have seen high turnouts among conservative voters - especially if there were ballots on gay marriage or abortion.</p> <p>In an attempt to bring out the faithful this year conservatives in Colorado drafted a ballot measure that confers human rights on a fertilised egg from the moment of conception. </p> <p>Church leaders have also tried to impress on their followers that - even if they are still cool towards McCain - conservatives cannot afford to have Obama in the White House.</p> <p>But with election officials predicting unprecedented turnout across Colorado - up to 90% in heavily Democratic Denver and Boulder -the tested Republican strategy of winning elections by getting out the evangelical vote is unlikely to work. That vote would be simply swamped by a very high turnout.</p> <p>There are also signs that evangelical power over the ballot box could be waning - even in Colorado Springs.</p> <p>Recent years have seen more Democrats in the area. There have also been signs of an internal revolt against local conservative Republican politicians.</p> <p>Over the years, the influx of evangelicals to Colorado Springs shifted the local party establishment to the right. Party politics increasingly revolved around the emotive issues such as abortion. That alienated more traditional Republicans who wanted their officials to focus on the economy and infrastructure.</p> <p>Last month, Jan Martin, a lifelong Republican and an elected city council official, announced she was supporting Obama because she believed the party had moved too far to the right.</p> <p>\"I think Bush has been too extreme, and he has catered to this black-and-white extreme view of conservative Christian thinking. The leadership of the local party is still very conservative and still very much us against them.\"</p> <p>A number of evangelical leaders have also begun asking whether their movement has drifted too far to the right. Some church leaders in Colorado Springs have called for the evangelical focus to be broadened beyond abortion and gay marriage and address issues such as climate change and poverty.</p> <p>Few are willing to publicly write off McCain and the current brand of Republicanism. But in the political forum at Mountain Springs, local Republican elected officials were already discussing how they would operate under an Obama administration.</p> <p>\"God forbid, but if it comes about we are going to have to be speaking out like never before,\" said Doug Lamborn, the local Republican member of Congress.</p> <p>Republicans needed to update their methods of communications by launching more conservative blogs, added Amy Stephens, a local state representative.</p> <p>Holt was also now moving to reconcile himself to defeat. \"This could be the best thing that ever happened to the evangelical cause,\" he said. \"We're used to being against the tide.\"</p>",
  "<p>The funding mismatch between <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> and his opponent for the US presidency, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>, was starkly highlighted yesterday when the Republican candidate disclosed he had less than $47m (\u00a327m) available for the final stretch of the campaign to the November 4 election, compared with his rival's hundreds of millions.</p> <p>McCain, filing his accounts to the government-run electoral spending watchdog, revealed that in September he used $37m of the $84m in public funds he had available for his campaign.</p> <p>McCain accepted public financing of $84m, which puts a ceiling on any further spending under electoral law. Obama opted against public financing, leaving him free to raise and spend as much as he wants in private donations.</p> <p>The news came a day after Obama disclosed that he had raised a staggering $150m in September. </p> <p>Republican strategists admitted that the mismatch will mean that McCain's options are much narrower than Obama's and he will have to target the money more carefully on key states.</p> <p>Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, in a conference call with reporters, said: \"I think we can still win on that basis.\" But he admitted that Obama would go down as \"the greatest fundraiser in political history\".</p> <p>Davis expressed hope that the Republican party, which has separate funds amounting to $80m, would pitch in with ads supporting McCain's campaign. But some state party organisations, notably in Florida and Virginia, are reluctant to commit funds and are holding back for future contests.</p> <p>Massie Ritsch, who works for the independent Centre for Responsive Politics, a funding watchdog, acknowledged \"it is not a level playing field\". But he said the question was whether McCain could have matched Obama.</p> <p>\"I do not think he could have raised as much as Obama from private sources, or even near it. McCain must be hoping his party will close that gap,\" said Ritsch.</p> <p>Obama has raised more than $600m since the start of his presidential bid in February last year.</p> <p>Obama, who is already outspending McCain on advertising by four to one - and in some states by eight to one - is now well placed for a blitz on an unprecedented scale in the run-up to the election.</p> <p>In an NBC interview broadcast yesterday, Obama warned that, despite his spending advantage and poll leads both nationally and in battlefield states, the election would be close.</p> <p>\"There's no doubt. We think the race will tighten, because that's just what happens,\" he said. \"Even when there are substantial leads - and in each of these battleground states you've got a lot of close races - one of the messages that I've had to my team is that we don't let up.\"</p> <p>To underline the point, a CNN poll yesterday put Obama on 51% nationwide, to McCain's 46%, a marginal improvement for the Republican. The same pollsters earlier this month had Obama on 53% and McCain on 45%. But a Suffolk University poll in Ohio, one of the three big pivotal states, showed Obama extending his lead to 51%, compared to McCain's 42%.</p> <p>The polls were taken before George Bush's former secretary of state, Colin Powell, announced on Sunday that he was endorsing Obama. While that was widely interpreted as a plus for Obama's campaign, the influential rightwing radio celebrity, Rush Limbaugh, who attracts an audience of 15 million, claimed Powell made his decision based on racial solidarity. \"This was all about Powell and race, nothing about the nation and its welfare,\" Limbaugh said.</p> <p>With the election two weeks from today, the candidates are now close to the sprint stage, when the campaign day becomes longer and longer, with multi-state visits.</p> <p>Obama yesterday predicted that there would be more negative campaigning by McCain in the final fortnight. Referring to the weekend denunciation by McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, of \"robocalls\" - automatic phone calls linking Obama to Bill Ayers, a founding member of the US radical group the Weathermen - and of incendiary remarks at Republican rallies, Obama said: \"It's getting so bad that even Senator McCain's running mate denounced his tactics last night. As you know, you really have to work hard to violate Governor Palin's standards on negative campaigning.</p> <p>\"But we're not going to be distracted. We're not going to be diverted. Not this time. Not this year. Our challenges are too great for a politics that's so small.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is one of the joys of modern media that great events can be savoured in so many ways. Take the moment last weekend when the Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin came face to face with her impersonator and nemesis Tina Fey on the set of Saturday Night Live - a sublime moment that is sure to go down in both television and political history. You could have watched it live on TV if you happened to be in the States. You could have Tivoed it or downloaded it from the NBC website to enjoy when the fancy took you. Or - and this is how I recommend you do it, if you haven't already - you can pause the footage just as Palin is entering the stage and then forward it frame by frame until the precise second when the two women cross paths.</p> <p>Stop the film, and prepare to be astonished. Yes, we all knew that Palin and Fey looked alike. But as alike as this? Height: identical. Shade of hair: identical. Size and shape of ears: identical. You can quibble if you must - Palin's face is a little fleshier, and her jaw more square and chiselled, as behoves a caribou hunter from the wildnerness, but as the freezed frame proves beyond all reasonable doubt, Sarah Fey and Tina Palin are one.</p> <p>It has been a long time coming, this fusion of politics and make-believe in the American psyche. Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger are two obvious examples of those who have taken the silver screen and dragged it into the political arena. But the Saturday Night Live series of sketches has taken the transposition one stage further, into wholly new and surreal territory. With this, the boundary between political reality and comic fantasy has become so blurred it is almost impossible to remember where the one ends and the other begins. </p> <p>The fantasy: in the first Saturday Night Live sketch, in which Fey played Palin, her partner Amy Poehler (in the role of Hillary Clinton) turned to her and said: \"You're wearing Tina Fey glasses!\"</p> <p>The reality: Palin has told Fox News that a few years ago - long before she was campaigning to become but a heartbeat away from the US presidency - she dressed up as Fey on Halloween. Yes, you read that right: Palin impersonated Fey.</p> <p>The fantasy: Fey-as-Palin, a huge grin on her face, turns to the Saturday Night Live camera and delivers her killer line: \"I can see Russia from my house!\"</p> <p>The reality: Palin-as-Palin really did invoke the fact that Alaska, the state of which she is governor, is across the water from Russia as evidence of her foreign policy credentials, though she never delivered the line about seeing it from her house. Yet, if you Google the phrase, \"I can see Russia from my house,\" you will come up with plenty of bloggers who have ascribed the phrase directly to Palin, unaware or perhaps unbothered that it was pure fiction.</p> <p>So what has been the impact of what Lorne Michaels, Saturday Night Live's legendary producer, called \"a heightened reality\"? One clear winner has been the show itself, the 33-year-old institution that is perennially in need of resuscitation. More than 10 million people watched the first appearance of Feylin. The last time the show had that big an audience was in 2001, when the show was broadcast just three weeks after 9/11 as a classic example of humour triumphing over terrorism. By this Saturday, the number had risen to about 17 million viewers, with millions more sure to follow on the internet. </p> <p>The other obvious beneficiary has been Tina Fey, or, since we are in the business of trying to tease fact apart from fiction, let's give her her full name: Elizabeth Stamatina Fey. She was certainly presented with an impersonator's dream when John McCain nominated Palin as his running mate. But the physical likeness is just the start of it. Last week she told the US talkshow host David Letterman how she pulled off the Palin accent. \"[Palin] has a really crazy voice,\" Fey said. \"It's a little bit Fargo, a little bit Reese Witherspoon in Election. I also try and base it on my friend Paula's grandma - a sweet little ol' lady from Joliet, Illinois.\"</p> <p>Fey asked the Saturday Night Live writer assigned to the Palin sketches to script in lots of words with Rs in them. \"She loves those Rs,\" Fey said. \"William Ayerrrrrrrrrs [the former Weatherman bomber invoked by Palin as a \"pall\" of Obama] and terrrrrorrrrists - I think she thinks there's oil in those Rs, she's digging deep.\"</p> <p>Part of the power of the sketches has been that they stick so closely to Palin's real words. Take Palin's now infamous response to a TV interviewer's question about the Bush doctrine on the right to pre-emptive strikes. The Alaskan governor had clearly never heard of the concept, and gave the evasive reply: \"In what respect?\" It would have been easy to satirise that comment out of existence, in the comedic equivalent of a frenzied knife attack. Instead, Fey quietly and fatally delivers a single blow, twisting Palin's response ever so slightly into: \"I don't know what that is.\"</p> <p>Fey is not just one of America's upcoming comic actors but also an experienced writer of comedy. Born in 1970 in a comfortable middle-class suburb of Pennsylvania to a strongly Republican family, she first felt the benefits of making people laugh at school and pursued that by studying drama at college. She cut her teeth in the comedy world at Second City, a well-respected improvisational theatre in Chicago, where she met her composer husband Jeff Richmond. Saturday Night Live scouts spotted her there and she joined the show in 1997.</p> <p>Within two years she had been promoted by Michaels to head writer on the show - the first woman to occupy the role. So, like Palin, she was breaking glass ceilings; like Palin, battling within highly male and testosterone-fuelled environments. Tom Shales, the TV critic of the Washington Post and co-author of a history of Saturday Night Live, Live From New York, says that though the show had had several powerful women actors, including Gilda Radner, women had struggled to find a footing within the writers' room. \"The show had a very bad reputation for being a male and almost misogynistic club with men in leading positions and women in the wings. Tina was in the vanguard of changing that - you could call her the Joan of Arc of the moment.\"</p> <p>Along with other tough women actors and writers, including Poehler, Molly Shannon, Ana Gasteyer and Rachel Dratch, she succeeded in shaking the programme up, first as senior writer and then, from 2000, as co-anchor of the news segment of the show, Weekend Update, a stint that earned her the ultimate accolade of being compared by one critic to Saturday Night Live's first head writer and figurehead, John Belushi. In the inevitable trajectory of these things, Fey has gone on to greater things - quitting Saturday Night Live in 2006 to pursue her acting career. Her TV series 30 Rock, a spoof on the behind-the-scenes life of a neurotic television writer that draws, evidently, on her own experiences, has become a favourite of the media-savvy crowd. It won three Emmys this year, including an award for Fey for best actress in a comedy show. But despite its success, 30 Rock has remained something of an acquired taste, not quite shifting her into the top bracket of performers who can draw box-office profits across America. Ironically it has taken Sarah Palin to project her into the stratosphere, making her a household name.</p> <p>Tina Fey, winner. Saturday Night Live, winner. But the big question, of course, is how does Palin come out of all this? Will political analysts look back on the Feylin phenomenon and say it was the thing that saved the governor of Alaska from herself, or that drove the final nail into her coffin?</p> <p>Pollsters give a few clues. First, we know that the Fey-as-Palin sketches have had huge penetration among voters. The non-partisan Pew Research Centre found that awareness of the sketches was running at about 42% - one point greater than Palin's \"real\" TV interviews. Another firm of analysts, HCD Research, studied the reaction among voters to the sketches and found that Palin's favourability rating fell by four points among independents and seven points among Democrats.</p> <p>That instant adverse reaction to the ridicule heaped on Palin by her doppelganger may be amplified by what analysts have defined as the \"priming\" effect of political humour. Lauren Feldman, a communications professor at the American University, described the process by which satire can work on viewers' subconscious. \"The more you see Tina Fey sending up Sarah Palin's style of speech, her folksy mannerisms and her lack of knowledge, the more those characteristics rise to the top of your mind when you come to listen to the real Sarah Palin, and that influences your assessment of her.\"</p> <p>A similar pattern can be seen with past political jokes, with Gerald Ford often held up as the textbook victim. Some go as far as to suggest that the parody of Ford by Saturday Night Live's Chevy Chase as a bumbler-in-chief actually cost him the 1976 election.</p> <p>On the other hand, HCD Research also found a pronounced jolt in the other direction among Republican voters. After watching the Fey sketches, they emerged angry and fired up, determined to work even harder on behalf of their party to defeat what they see as the east-coast liberals who control the media and seek to brainwash the electorate. </p> <p>There is another way that the sketches by Fey, 38, could actually benefit Palin, 44. It has been suggested by several liberal bloggers that by focusing on the cutesy, bumbling side of Palin's nature, Fey could be distracting attention away from some of her uglier behaviour. As Time magazine pointed out recently, while Fey's Palin was asking to phone a friend because she couldn't answer a simple question from a TV interviewer, in reality, Palin's Palin was out on the campaign stump, telling the whipped-up crowd that Obama was \"not a man who sees America like you and I see America\".</p> <p>Whichever of these dynamics - the pro- or anti-Palin - proves to be more prominent, we do know one thing: Tina Fey is praying for her lookalike to lose. \"She's enjoyed the run, and it's greatly increased her visibility,\" says Shales. \"But she knows it has to end and she doesn't want to get stuck in the part and typecast. She'll be happy when it goes away.\"</p> <p>Michaels has confirmed that even in the now somewhat unlikely case that the Republicans win and Palin enters the White House as vice president, Saturday Night Live will be looking for a new impersonator of her. As for Fey, she has said: \"I want to be done playing this lady by 5 November. So if anybody can help me be done playing this lady, that would be good for me.\"</p> <p>There's no need to worry about what happens to Fey thereafter. Life for her after Palin is already looking bountiful. Next year she is due to appear in This Side of Truth, directed by Ricky Gervais, and she is in discussions over further Hollywood films after last year's debut Baby Mama, which received mixed reviews. 30 Rock has started its third series, and publishers Little, Brown has just commissioned a book from her reputed to be worth $5m.</p> <p>And what about Palin? We'll know better what fate holds for her in 15 days' time. But even if she doesn't make it to the White House, don't feel too sorry for her. There's bound to be big money out there for her to repeat her Halloween impersonation of Tina Fey.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Thursday October 23 2008.

  "<p>Of all the dramatic changes history has witnessed since 1945 - the economic miracle in postwar western Europe, the collapse of Communism and now the latest boom and bust - none was more unforeseen than the resurgence of religion. A new \"revolt of Islam\" was quite unexpected 50 years ago, when secular Arab nationalism seemed the rising force, and when, for that matter, secular Israelis didn't guess that \"religious Zionists\" would one day make the running in their country.</p> <p>And yet what may be the most striking and important development is the renewed role of religion in the US, and its political implications. John McCain has tried to negatively associate Barack Obama with Jeremiah Wright, his fire-eating radical pastor (or former pastor), but much less attention has been paid to Sarah Palin's membership of the Assembly Church of God in Wasilla and to her own pastor, Ed Kalnins. When Colin Powell endorsed Obama on Sunday, he said Palin was not yet ready to be president. He might have added that her religious opinions also raised questions about her fitness for high office.</p> <p>Religion may now be the largest gulf between Europe and the US. Mitt Romney, the Mormon who ran for the Republican nomination, spoke of the empty cathedrals of Europe, and Tony Blair was the oddity among European politicians in his public protestations of faith. </p> <p>Maybe Blair would be more at home in the US, if not quite at Saddleback, the \"evangelical megachurch\" in California, where McCain and Obama bared their sinful souls. Obama blamed his early \"experiments\" with alcohol and drugs on \"a certain selfishness\", and McCain confessed to his \"greatest moral failing\" with the end of his first marriage.</p> <p>And yet, weird and embarrassing as this sounded to Europeans, it would have done so to Americans also not long ago. For Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt to have taken part in any such event during the 1932 presidential campaign would have seemed quite absurd, or Harry Truman and Thomas Dewey in 1948. Four years later, Dwight Eisenhower had so little religious upbringing that he needed to be discreetly baptised before he reached the White House.</p> <p>In 1960 religion did become a factor, and earlier this year Romney invoked the memory of John F Kennedy to suggest his own eccentric faith shouldn't be held against him. But that was not comparing like with like. Kennedy was the first Roman Catholic to be elected president, and in a famous speech to protestant pastors in Texas he upheld the principle of the first amendment - the separation of church and state.</p> <p>But he was only insisting that a man of Catholic affiliation could be as good an American as anyone (something the Bible belt was far from conceding when Al Smith, another Irish Catholic, was running for president only 32 years earlier). What Kennedy did not say was that his career had been inspired by a devotion to Our Lady and the Sacred Heart. If he had, apart from the fact that anyone who knew him would have found it hard to keep a straight face, he would have lost the election.</p> <p>Nearly half a century later there has been a complete change. Palin's convention speech was held for a time to be the height of feisty wit; but much more revealing is what she and her pastor have said about \"the end of days\", an idea in which millions of American evangelical Christians sincerely believe. According to Kalnins, the Jewish people must be gathered into the Land of Israel as a preliminary to Armageddon. When that vast conflict comes the Jews will be converted, or possibly annihilated, and it will be followed by the Rapture.</p> <p>Already Kalnins sees \"the storm clouds are gathering\" through conflict in the Middle East: \"Scripture specifically mentions oil instability as a sign of the Rapture. We're seeing more and more oil wars. The contractions of the fulfilment of prophecies are getting tighter and tighter.\" And he hopes to witness the Rapture soon. \"I'm just looking at the turmoil of the world, Iraq, other places - everywhere people are fighting against Christ,\" he says. Since Palin is one of his flock, she presumably believes this too. She certainly believes that Jesus told us to invade Iraq: she said so from the pulpit.</p> <p>Not long ago John McCain was obliged to disown John Hagee, a Texan preacher with a huge following who is not only militantly hostile to Catholicism and Islam but believes that \"Hitler was a hunter\" who had been sent by God to drive the Jews to Israel. Even assuming that McCain does not become the next president, sceptical Europe might stop and think about where the fulfilment of prophecies could yet lead us all.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:wheaty@compuserve.com\">wheaty@compuserve.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton was scheduled to join Barack Obama on the campaign trail last night for the first time since the two held a rally in New Hampshire in June.</p> <p>The joint appearance in Orlando, Florida, is a fulfilment of her promise to campaign aggressively for him.</p> <p>The rally was part of a two-day blitz in Florida, where the polls opened yesterday for early voting in an effort to avoid congestion and confusion on November 4.</p> <p>Clinton had a campaign stop earlier yesterday in Fort Lauderdale that saw many supporters flee when it began to rain heavily. At his rally in Tampa yesterday, Obama attacked negative campaigning by the Republicans. </p> <p>\"That's what you do when you're out of ideas, out of touch and running out of time,\" said Obama, who is expected at a campaign event in Miami today.</p> <p>Clinton, who turns 61 on Sunday, still harbours hopes of a presidential run, even if Obama was to be a two-term president.</p> <p>According to those close to her, she does not anticipate Obama, if he becomes president, will offer her a job that would appeal. He already has figures in mind for senior cabinet posts such as secretary of state and sensitive posts such as health reform.</p> <p>Having ruled out in a television interview an appointment to the supreme court, Clinton is planning to focus on fighting for health reform from the senate.</p> <p>Her supporters have been slow to warm to Obama and demonstrated their unhappiness at the Democratic convention in August. But she used her convention speech to urge them to rally behind him.</p> <p>According to internal Democratic polls, before the convention only about 30% of her supporters had been planning to back Obama but that has now shifted to 80%.</p> <p>Victory in Florida would almost guarantee Obama the presidency. Although George Bush took the state in 2000 and 2004, Obama has a three-point lead over John McCain, according to RealClearPolitics, which takes the overall average of recent opinion poll figures.</p> <p>The Democratic party reported over the weekend that it had registered 400,000 more Democrats than in 2004, while the Republican party has registered 150,000 more Republicans in comparison.</p> <p>Though Clinton remains bitter about her bruising defeat at the hands of Obama in the primaries, she has been out on the campaign trail for him over the last month. This, however, has gone largely uncovered by the US media.</p> <p>She has been campaigning in states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, where she beat him in primaries, mainly because she won over white, working-class voters who have proved resistant to Obama. Her constant refrain on the campaign trail is that he will look out for the working class.</p> <p>Last week she said Obama had closed the deal with the US public and predicted \"a great victory\" for him on November 4.</p> <p>Clinton, who wants to avoid accusations that she did not do enough to secure a Democratic victory, has also put in appearances in recent weeks in swing states such as Michigan, West Virginia New Hampshire, Nevada, New Mexico and Colorado.</p>",
  "<p>The US presidential election will not be free and fair, because millions of electors will either not be allowed to vote or will not have their votes properly counted. It could cost Barack Obama the White House, even if he wins most of the votes on November 4. This sensational claim is based on research by the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/us/politics/09voting.html\">New York Times</a> (NYT) and BBC Newsnight. The NYT found that in some states for every new voter registered in the last couple of months, two voters have been removed \u2013 negating Obama's massive voter registration drive. This voter purging could mean fewer people voting next month than voted in 2004. </p> <p>In Colorado, for example, which has seen a significant population increase since the last presidential election, the state has recorded a net loss of nearly 100,000 voters from its rolls since 2004. Louisiana, Michigan and Colorado are deleting registered voters from the rolls within 90 days of a federal election, which is illegal except when voters die, notify the authorities that they have moved out of state, or have been declared unfit to vote.</p> <p>This widespread electoral malpractice is independently corroborated by a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7617204.stm\">Newsnight</a> investigation by <a href=\"http://www.gregpalast.com\">Greg Palast</a>. He reminds us that in the 2004 presidential election, between 1.6 and three million votes were cast but <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/23638322/block_the_vote/2\">never counted</a>, according to the US Election Assistance Commission. This is easily enough votes to have changed the outcome of the poll and put John Kerry in the White House. </p> <p>Palast says that almost three million voters have already been purged from the voter rolls \u2013 mostly poor and black voters who are more likely to vote Democrat. During elections in New Mexico earlier this year, one in nine voters found that their names had disappeared from the voter rolls. In Colorado, the disenfranchisement is even greater, with 20% of voters being purged.</p> <p>It has happened before. During the 2004 presidential election one in four registered Ohio voters turned up at the polling booth only to discover that their names were not on the voter roll, an exclusion rate of 25%. </p> <p>Democrat leaders are too high on their \"Yes we can\" hype to kick up a fuss about this massive disenfranchisement of their voters. They naively assume that Obama's poll lead will give him victory, regardless of the election bias. It might. But then, again, it might not. </p> <p>Another form of voter exclusion is happening in Michigan, where 62,000 lower income families, mostly Democrat supporters, face losing their homes to foreclosure. Loss of residence means losing their voting address and their right to vote. Many of the evictions are being orchestrated by a foreclosure company that supports the Republican party.</p> <p>Michigan isn't alone. In several crucial swing states, including Nevada and Florida, foreclosures and the consequent loss of voting rights could affect the outcome and decide the presidency. </p> <p>Election bias doesn't stop there. The Republican strategist <br><a href=\"http://www.rove.com/election\">Karl Rove</a> has <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2006/10/31/will_a_shocking_new_gop_court\">backed</a> a new law requiring voters to show photo ID at the polling booth. One in ten US citizens don't have photo ID. Among African Americans it is one in five. This requirement will disenfranchise millions of poor, elderly and black Americans, who tend to vote Democrat. In one swing state, Indiana, an estimated 100,000 African-Americans may lose their right to vote. A combination of voter roll purging and photo ID requirement could be enough to swing the presidential election in favour of John McCain \u2013 even if Barack Obama has a substantial opinion poll lead on election day. </p> <p>Writing in Rolling Stone magazine in 2006, the civil rights lawyer Robert Kennedy Jr, JFK's nephew, <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10432334/was_the_2004_election_stolen\">revealed</a> how voting irregularities in 2004 were enough to steal the presidency for the Republicans. He has also <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/11717105/robert_f_kennedy_jr__will_the_next_election_be_hacked/1\">demonstrated</a> that the electronic voting machines that will be used in the November 4 election are not reliable and accurate, and that they are vulnerable to hacking. Moreover, he shows that three of the four companies that supply voting machines and count the votes have close links with the Republican party.</p> <p>Writing in the same magazine this month, Kennedy and Palast document large-scale election irregularities by the<br>Republicans that they believe could be enough to swing the election. Their meticulously researched <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/23638322/block_the_vote\">expose</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/videos/player/23654789\">documentary</a> catalogue evidence that the Republicans may have already stolen the 2008 presidential vote.</p> <p>\"If Democrats are to win the 2008 election,\" Kennedy and Palast conclude, \"they must not simply beat John McCain at the polls \u2013 they must beat him by a margin that exceeds the level of GOP [Republican] vote tampering.\"</p>",
  "<p>Commenter dcmcgrain asks:</p> <blockquote> <p>Yesterday Colin Powell endorsed Barack Obama. And today (or sometime last night), Mr. Obama promised the American people that General Powell would have a position in Obama's administration.</p> <p>It was about a month ago that John McCain answered a question about who he would put at the head of the SEC. He said Andrew Cuomo. You accused Mr. McCain of possibly breaking the law with his statements in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/22/johnmccain.wallstreet\">this post</a>.</p> <p>First of all, Mr McCain was answering a question and named a name. He made no promise and there was no indication that he had been in contact with Mr Cuomo or his office. The law you are referring to is intended to end the good ol' Spoils System of Andrew Jackson and has done just that. Mr McCain made no promise and has received no aid from Mr Cuomo, so your accusation was absurd</p> <p>But secondly, how do you feel about Obama-Powell? Shouldn't this bit of politics be getting some attention on your blog?</p> </blockquote> <p>I have to say I think that's a fair point. We're all wrong sometimes, and I don't mind admitting that I was wrong then. And I think it was mildly inappropriate of Obama to say what he said this morning. There's no reason to suspect that there was any kind of specific deal in the works, but he should have been more circumspect about any potential Powell role.<br></p>",
  "<p>Elements of Iran's ruling clerical and political elites are enjoying the west's financial implosion. It has deflected attention from the country's internal troubles and its increased international isolation. And as the campaign for next June's presidential election gathers pace, capitalism's travails handily illustrate the supposed superiority of Iran's unique system of collectivist Islamic republicanism.</p> <p>Leading prayers in Tehran last Friday, <a href=\"http://www.metimes.com/Security/2008/10/17/ayatollah_blames_us_for_economic_woes/99e7/\">Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami</a> declared that US-promoted liberal democracy was collapsing under the weight of its moral contradictions. \"It started with an ethical downfall and has now reached an economic failure \u2026 See how sad the funeral is! Even the undertaker is crying! They tried to create a crisis for us [through UN sanctions] but God created a crisis for them.\"</p> <p>Such triumphalism is unlikely to last long or be widely shared among a population enduring 30% inflation, high unemployment, and the continuing failure of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to share Iran's oil wealth and boost family incomes as he promised. Ahmadinejad, elected in 2005, is expected to run again. But unease over his confrontational nuclear policies, his Holocaust denial, and threats against Israel are all additional reasons why he may be denied a second term.</p> <p>Recent developments have driven home the weakness of the current regime. One was the UN general assembly's vote, by a humiliating 158 to 32, to deny Iran a two-year rotational membership of the security council. John Sawers, Britain's UN ambassador, undiplomatically called the vote a \"thrashing\". Tehran blamed Zionist lobbying for what it called an \"<a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKTRE49J35520081020\">obvious injustice</a>\". But the bottom line was plain: more than three-quarters of the world's countries do not trust Iran to do the right thing under its present leadership.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad's government has had to back off at home after a 3% sales tax provoked widespread protests. More significantly in terms of the coming election, the sudden halving of the global oil price has damaging implications for Iran's foreign earnings, for badly needed oil and gas investment, and for an impoverished domestic economy as a whole.</p> <p>The president's unpopularity does not automatically mean defeat. He retains the support of the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, the Revolutionary Guards and ubiquitous Basij militia. He has a strong following among the less educated, rural poor. And as usual, the broadly-defined \"reformist\" opposition, consisting of numerous rivalrous individuals and factions, is badly divided, lacking a common standard-bearer.</p> <p>Mohammad Khatami, the former two-term president who disappointed many supporters with his cautious approach in office, is nevertheless most frequently mentioned as the reformists' likely candidate. The Mehr news agency reported this week that Khatami had decided not to run and had proposed a former prime minister, Mir-Hossein Mousavi, in his place. But his intentions remain unclear.</p> <p>The only declared major contender for Ahmadinejad's job so far is <a href=\"http://www.iranfocus.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2392\">Mahdi Karroubi</a>, a former Majlis (parliament) speaker with a reputation as a moderate. He announced his candidacy last week. Karroubi indicated a more flexible approach to nuclear negotiations and said Iran had \"paid dearly\" for Ahmadinejad's Holocaust stance. He also hinted he might step aside if the reformists could agree to unite behind Khatami.</p> <p>All the same, opposition disunity and factionalism remain a bigger enemy than the \"principle-ists\" (fundamentalists) of the clerical right. Jahanbakhsh Khanjani of the Executives of Construction party warned recently that the reformists could win but only if they stuck together in a coalition. \"Undoubtedly convergence, solidarity and consensus will have positive effects among reformists and will set the ground for their victory,\" he told the Mardom-Salari newspaper.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad may yet face a more potent challenge from moderate conservatives such as Ali Larijani, the former nuclear negotiator who he forced out of the national security council, or Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, a former Tehran mayor known a moderniser. Larijani is now Majlis speaker and is said to have the ear of the Supreme Leader. Lurking in the background, as ever, is Hashemi Rafsanjani, another former president and veteran consevative power-broker who was runner-up in 2005.</p> <p>Yet as Iranians look for voluntary regime change next June, all the likely candidates share one major drawback: over-familiarity. The biggest obstacle to change is apathy among an electorate where a majority is under 35. Many younger voters may think Iran, for once, should take a leaf out of the Great Satan's book and seek a \"transformational figure\" \u2013 not another regime re-tread.</p> <p>No need for Israeli or American military action: Ahmadinejad is politically vulnerable and could well be removed peacefully by his own people if the west will only wait. But first, perhaps, Iranians should find their own version of Barack Obama.</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton was scheduled to join Barack Obama on the campaign trail tonight for the first time since the two held a rally in New Hampshire in June.</p> <p>The joint appearance in Orlando, Florida, is a fulfilment of her promise to campaign aggressively for him. The rally was part of a two-day blitz in Florida, where the polls opened today for early voting in an effort to avoid congestion and confusion on November 4.</p> <p>Clinton had a campaign stop earlier today in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, that saw many supporters flee when it began to rain heavily. And Obama held a rally today in Tampa and is expected at a campaign event in Miami tomorrow.</p> <p>Clinton, who turns 61 later this week, is still harbouring hopes of a presidential run, even if Obama was to be a two-term president. According to those close to her, she does not anticipate Obama, if he becomes president, will offer her a job that would appeal to her. He already has figures in mind for senior cabinet posts such as secretary of state and sensitive posts such as health reform.</p> <p>Having ruled out in a television interview an appointment to the supreme court, she is planning to focus on fighting for health reform from the Senate.</p> <p>Clinton's supporters have been slow to warm to Obama and demonstrated their unhappiness at the Democratic convention in August. </p> <p>But she used her convention speech to urge them to rally behind him. According to internal Democratic polls, before the convention only about 30% of her supporters had been planning to back Obama but that has now shifted to 80%.</p> <p>Victory in Florida would almost guarantee Obama the presidency. </p> <p>Although President George Bush took the state in 2000 and 2004, Obama has a three-point lead over John McCain, according to Real Clear Politics which averages out recent poll figures.</p> <p>The Democratic party reported over the weekend that it had registered 400,000 more Democrats than in 2004, while the Republicans had registered only 150,000 more.</p> <p>Clinton remains bitter about her bruising defeat at the hands of Obama in the Democratic primary but, largely uncovered by the US media, she has been out on the campaign trail for him over the last month.</p> <p>She has been campaigning in states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, where she beat him in primaries, mainly because she won over white, working-class voters who have been resistant to Obama. Her constant refrain on the campaign trail is that he will look out for the working-class.</p> <p>She said last week that Obama had closed the deal with the American public and predicted \"a great victory\" for him on November 4. </p> <p>Clinton, who wants to avoid accusations that she did not do enough to secure a Democratic victory, has also put in appearances in recent weeks in swing states such as Michigan, West Virginia, New Hampshire, Nevada, New Mexico and Colorado.</p>",

  "<p>Not surprising to see Judy Miller joining Fox News.

  "<p>Some national polls in the last two days have shown the race tightening a little bit, going from six or seven points to five or six points. It bears watching.</p> <p>Four possible explanations:<br>1. The \"he's a socialist\" line is gaining traction. This is the most worrisome explanation, because Obama isn't really answering it. He will have one more chance to do so on a big scale, that 30 minutes of prime-time television he bought on October 29. But two-plus weeks of being called a \"socialist\" isn't a good thing in this country.<br>2. As a result of the third debate, McCain has managed to get some distance from Bush, i.e., with that line about how if Obama wanted to run against Bush he should have run four years ago. CNN's Bill Schneider cites this as the reason.<br>3. Nate Silver, <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/todays-polls-1018.html\">writing on Saturday</a>, said that maybe McCain has gotten more GOP base voters to come back to the fold with more enthusiasm in recent days:<br></p> <blockquote> <p><br>Between \"Joe the Plumber\", \"spread the wealth\", \"I'm not George Bush\", etc., however, McCain at least now seems to have a few somewhat more constructive talking points (in that sense, the fact that the Ayers attacks went over like a lead balloon at the debate might have done him a favor). So some of those crestfallen conservatives might have moved back into the likely voter universe.</p> <p>What I don't know that McCain is doing, on the other hand, is actually persuading very many voters, and particularly not independents or registered Democrats. If that is the case, than McCain is likely to run into something of a wall very soon here, brought about the Republicans' substantial disadvantage in partisan identification. </p> </blockquote> <p>Obviously, this is a comparatively non-worrisome explanation. <br>4. Races just tighten toward the end for reasons we don't know. They almost always do.</p> <p>One thing to remember here I suppose is that we elect presidents by state, so at this point it's really state polls that matter. It's possible that national poll numbers are skewed by more enthusiasm among Republicans in deep-red states. That'll help McCain's national numbers, but if it's actually reflective of increased enthusiasm in Idaho and Oklahoma and Texas and so on, it doesn't matter electorally.</p> <p>I'd say watch the polling especially closely in Virginia, Colorado and a few other states over the next few days. Those are two states Obama needs. If he holds the Kerry states and wins those two, plus Iowa and New Mexico, where he seems to be comfortably ahead, he's won. Actually he wins numerically with either Virginia or Colorado in that scenario, but a little cushion doesn't hurt.<br></p>",

  "<p>Like many Americans these days, I spend lots of time checking <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/\">pollster.com</a>'s polls of polls and their Electoral College map. The poll of polls, like the analogous product over at realclearpolitics.com and others, offers an aggregate of the most recent public polls.</p> <p>The site's editors <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/faq/map_faq.php\">explained</a> that the polling aggregate they offer is not merely an average of the most recent polls. Rather, they use a more complicated statistics analysis to determine the trend.</p> <p>The pollster.com aggregate is of no use if isn't accurate, so I unscientifically analysed the site's performance in 2006. They were spot on, correctly calling 50 out of the 51 races I examined. While it is impossible to gauge how accurate today's polling is, two weeks out from election day, the results give weight to pollster.com's read of the trend.<br><br>I looked <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/2006governor.php\">29 gubernatorial races</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/2006senate.php\">22 senate races</a> with at least five polls for the site's algorithm to work with. Of those, Pollster.com's final aggregate was correct 50 times. They were only wrong in Minnesota's gubernatorial race, where Republican Tim Pawlenty won by one percentage point after Pollster.com had Democrat Mike Hatch winning by 2.6 percentage points. The 2006 results are <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006/\">available on CNN.com.</a></p> <p>Also noteworthy, the pollster.com aggregates tended to under poll for the Democratic candidates. For example, just before Maryland's 2006 senatorial race, pollster.com gave Democrat Ben Cardin 48.4% and Republican Michael Steele 45.2%. The actual result was 54%-44% for Cardin. </p> <p>My unscientific analysis demands several caveats. For one, it is impossible to tell how accurate the polling was two weeks before the election, where we are now. We can only compare the aggregates as the candidates crossed the finish line with the actual result. Also, pollster.com may have tinkered with their algorithm since 2006. </p> <p>The unprecedented enthusiasm for Obama's candidacy among young and African-American voters, compounded with the expected surge in turnout, complicate sampling for the companies conducting the polls. The pollsters say they account for the changing electoral.</p> <p>Lastly, it remains to be seen whether Obama will suffer from the \"Bradley effect\", under which African-American candidates under-perform late polling. It is a matter of debate whether the Bradley effect, named for a 1982 candidate for governor of California who lost the election after leading polls by more than 10 points, ever existed, or if it did once, whether it would affect the race this year. It was not universally apparent during the Democrats' long primary season.</p> <p>The most important figures on pollster.com's page are those tracking the polls in the battleground states, not the national number, because the winner of the electoral college takes the White House, not the winner of the national popular vote. The national polls, which show McCain tightening Obama's lead in recent days, may no longer be a useful compass tracking the nation's leanings, since McCain may be pulling head in bright red states he is already certain to win. For example, McCain's leads in Nebraska, Texas and Arizona appear to be growing. Increased support there for McCain would show up on a national poll but would have no bearing on his ability to win in Ohio and Virginia.</p>",
  "<p>Mercedes Leon tries to stay away from politics at family gatherings, but inevitably, the subject comes up when she and her 26-year-old son, Enrique, get together.</p> <p>She is a conservative Republican and Cuban exile who is running for Florida state attorney this year. Her son is a liberal Democrat, born in Orlando, who defines himself as \"very anti-Republican\".</p> <p>She believes in small government and tax breaks. He thinks there should be universal health care.</p> <p>He tells her the Republican party only cares about the rich. And she - who survived a shipwreck while fleeing the Communist island to come to Florida in 1980 - hurls at him the worst political insult a Cuban-American can bestow on another: \"I end up calling him a communist, and I tell him, 'You sound like [Fidel] Castro.'\"</p> <p>That's usually when Enrique Leon storms out.</p> <p>Their arguments may not always be so dramatic, but they illustrate what appears to be a growing generational split among Cuban-Americans. Despite their traditional support of Republicans, their political views are more diverse than meets the eye.</p> <p>\"We get in huge fights about these issues. I mean huge - even at birthday dinners,\" said Mercedes Leon, a 45-year-old attorney from Kissimmee. \"The younger generation is too idealistic.\"</p> <p>Older Cubans, who have been a reliable source of votes for Republicans, are still driven by their harrowing experiences as exiles from a Communist regime.</p> <p>But second-generation Cubans, and even recent \u00e9migr\u00e9s who arrived after the Mariel boatlift in 1980, are beginning to shatter the stereotype of the one-party voting bloc. \"I'm much more concerned about what happens in domestic policy,\" said Enrique Leon, a Kissimmee accountant. \"In regards to Cuba, I don't believe we should interfere with their form of government. That's more of their domestic problem.\"</p> <p>Florida is ground zero for these voters, particularly in the southern region where the bulk of Florida's 1.1 million Cubans reside. </p> <p>Although an estimated 25,400 Cubans live in Orlando's metropolitan area, they are an influential group that includes business and community leaders. Most Cubans in the state are US citizens.</p> <p>Their broadening political orientation, however, is a gradual process that has yet to yield a substantial number of Democrats.</p> <p>A recent study of voting behaviour among Cuban-Americans in Miami-Dade county found that they voted mostly Republican in the last presidential election - with nearly 70% support for the GOP. However, other survey questions showed their views straying from conservative values on gay marriage, gun control and even abortion.</p> <p>\"There's potential for political change, but there is no reason to think it's going to happen quickly or soon,\" said Benjamin Bishin, the study's chief author and a political science professor at the University of California, Riverside. \"People with the more hard-line views who describe themselves as conservatives on the [Cuban] embargo and the travel ban are disproportionately eligible to be registered voters and to participate in the election.\"</p> <p>Those voters are also more visible.</p> <p>While some young voters of Cuban heritage preferred not to be quoted on their political views, regulars at Sociedad Cubana de Orlando, a social club in south Orlando, were not shy about saying what was on their minds.</p> <p>On a recent Friday evening at the club, where several cars parked outside sported bumper stickers in support of Senator John McCain that read Estamos Unidos (we are united), four men were deeply engaged in a dominoes match. They were quick to draw a comparison between Senator Barack Obama and their community's historical nemesis.</p> <p>\"Once upon a time there was a mister who rose up in Cuba saying, 'We want change,' and his name was Fidel Castro Ruz,\" said Ted Turvelo, 71. \"And now, 'change' is Obama's slogan.\"</p> <p>Another common thread among exiles is their suspicion of big government because in Cuba, the one-party bureaucracy controls everything. They prefer a pro-business society that is consistent with McCain's vision.</p> <p>\"I don't like wealth redistribution. I work very hard and, if I choose to divide my wealth, that is my business, but redistribution is what socialism is all about,\" said Vicky Llevada, an exile who directs a local non-profit.</p> <p>On the campaign trail, the presidential candidates have split on issues related to Cuba, appealing to different sides of the political divide. McCain favours the embargo and toughened travel restrictions. Obama would lift the travel ban and would even meet with Cuban leaders.</p> <p>Obama's openness to a new Cuba policy doesn't bother Lili Milanes, an 18-year-old freshman at the University of Central Florida. Her father, Jorge, is a Cuban exile. Her mother, Cecilia, is a second-generation Cuban from New Jersey.<br>\"The country's policy on Cuba [is really bad]. Just because Cuba is Communist doesn't mean that it is contagious and we can't go and visit and see how everyone lives,\" Milanes said. \"I would like to go to Cuba.\"</p> <p>Showcasing Cubans' emerging diversity of views, her exiled father co-wrote a Spanish-language song set to Cuban folk music that has been posted on YouTube. The lyrics encourage people to vote for Obama: \"We don't want war and bombs,\" the song goes, \"we want music and roast pork.\"</p>",
  "<p>If the Republicans lose on November 4 they will no doubt spend a good portion of the next four years soul searching and whining, as Democrats have for the past eight. For much of this they will blame Barack Obama. But I also hope they blame Hank Paulson, author and midwife of the federal government's plan to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/14/us-banks-bailout-bush\">buy $250bn of preferred stock in the nation's largest banks</a>.</p> <p>The Republican party is supposed to be the party of the free market. So how did we get from there to here? In 2000 George Bush ran for president as something called a <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03EED8173EF931A25755C0A9669C8B63\">compassionate conservative</a>, which Bush described obscurely as \"first and foremost springing from the heart\". But the heart, Bush was quick to insist, must be set free. The word \"regulations\" or its variants crops up 28 times in the 2000 platform, and Bush wasn't asking for more of them. Instead, he was fond of mocking Al Gore for presiding over a regulatory bureaucracy that had (in his telling) one agency to <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E1D71E3FF933A25755C0A9669C8B63\">uphold safety standards for pepperoni pizza</a> and one for plain.</p> <p>But in practice, freedom plus compassion meant an incoherent mix-tape of lower taxes and higher discretionary spending, coupled with a couple hundred billon dollars in new entitlement spending, like the Medicare prescription drug bill. The have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too theory on government extended to a new emphasis on \"voluntary regulations\", which are a lot like ordinary regulations except no one actually follows them. These included a critical 2004 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/business/27sec.html\">decision by the SEC</a> that freed up the amount of debt the brokerage units of investment banks could take on.</p> <p>Then in 2004 Bush ran for re-election by promising to hail in something called the <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/09/19/bush-ownership-society/\">ownership society</a>. This had two big themes. The first was privatising social security. That didn't take. The second was promoting home ownership, and that \u2013 annoyingly \u2013 did. Bush's 2004 stump speech trumpeted the \"fantastic news\" that home ownership was at an all-time high: \"Isn't it wonderful to have somebody for the first time be able to say: 'Welcome to my home; I'm glad you're here at my piece of property'?\"</p> <p>This was also ostensibly about expanding the virtues of the free market. Bush <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/02/24/mgrind.day.tue/index.html\">said</a> that in the 2004 election \"the American people will decide between two visions of government: a government that encourages ownership and opportunity and responsibility, or a government that takes your money and makes your choices\". Actually, it turned out that Americans didn't have to decide between the two visions of government at all. We were more than happy to own things we couldn't afford, and only slightly less happy to let the government make the choices about how to clean this up. Not much of a governing philosophy, in words.</p> <p>Which brings us to Paulson. Here, too, there is much irony. The big criticism of Paulson's predecessor, the chronically lethargic John Snow, was that he did an insufficient job of talking up the economy's strengths. When Paulson was nominated for the job two years ago the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/31/business/31treasury.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;adxnnlx=1224086503-FNkrAxD7XVZXmquv7xb6fg\">reported</a> that he \"initially rebuffed overtures\" because the job was \"widely viewed as having declined in influence and prestige during Mr Bush's presidency\". Only after wining and dining Paulson in the White House residence was the Bush team able to \"hammer home its argument that reports of the Treasury Department's diminution were exaggerated\". Exaggerated indeed.</p> <p>And so the man brought in to be a bigger booster for the unsung successes of American capitalism is now responsible for organising a partial nationalisation of American banks. For conservatives, this is a problem. A good portion of them are trying, as they say, to put lipstick on the pig. </p> <p>National Review editor Rich Lowry, after <a href=\"http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTVlMzBiZmE3ZWY1MWY3NjUwZTAzNmM1NGQ1Nzg0Yzk=\">noting</a> obligatorily in his most recent column that \"Euro-bureaucrats have always hated\" American capitalism's \"out-of-control dynamism,\" goes on to make the sporting argument that buying ownership stakes in the country's largest banks \"isn't socialism, but emergency measures to preserve credit, the lifeblood of capitalism\". This is a valiant effort, but if Republicans are going to argue that partial collective ownership of the banking system \u2013 the \"lifeblood of capitalism\", remember! \u2013 isn't socialistic, then they should probably revisit their history of the cold war.</p> <p>Mostly, Republicans are just angry \u2013 especially the up-and-comers. Eve Fairbanks <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/10/05/ST2008100502658.html\">reported</a> in the Washington Post last week that not one of the GOP's freshmen congressmen voted for the bail-out bill when it came up for the original vote last Friday, despite the best efforts of House minority leader John Boehner to control them. Boehner himself referred to the bill as a \"crap sandwich\". Unfortunately for the Republicans, anger isn't a governing philosophy. But it is a recipe for wandering aimlessly in the philosophical desert for the next four years.</p> <p>I'm looking forward to it. And if you think the Republicans have had a coherent governing philosophy for the past eight years then I know somebody with a $700bn reward.</p>",

  "<p>Democrats are playing up a potential Republican rift today after Sarah Palin criticised automated phone calls her party is running across the country that depict Barack Obama as a terrorist sympathiser.</p> <p>In a candid interview with the reporters travelling on her plane, Palin said voters \"get a bit irritated with just being inundated\" by her campaign's \"robocalls\" linking Obama to the 1960s radical William Ayers.</p> <p>\"If I called all the shots, and if I could wave a magic wand,\" Palin told CNN, \"I would be sitting at a kitchen table with more and more Americans, talking to them about our plan to get the economy back on track and winning the war, and not having to rely on the old conventional ways of campaigning that includes those robocalls\".</p> <p>Palin questioned both parties' spending on TV advertisements, saying they were \"kind of draining out there in terms of Americans' attention span\".</p> <p>Both Obama aides and the Democratic party are circulating Palin's comments today, seeking to exacerbate the Republicans' internal tensions over the calls.</p> <p>Three pre-recorded phone calls are making the rounds in swing states such as Missouri and Ohio. One chides Obama for holding a Hollywood fundraiser during the economic crisis, another attacks his abortion record, and a third says ominously that Obama has \"worked closely\" with Ayers \u2013 a claim debunked widely in the press.</p> <p>Palin is not the first in her party to publicly criticise the McCain robocall strategy. Two Republican senators who face tough re-election battles this year, Susan Collins of Maine and Norm Coleman of Minnesota, have urged McCain to stop the calls.</p> <p>McCain has come under fire for running anti-Obama robocalls created by the same firm that devised a brutal smear campaign against him eight years ago during his Republican primary race against George W Bush.</p> <p>The calls broadcast to South Carolina voters in 2000 suggested wrongly that McCain's adopted Bangladeshi daughter was an illegitimate black child. After the phoned-in rumours were credited with pushing Bush to victory that year, McCain vowed not to use robocalls as a political tactic.</p>",
  "<p>Generally I try to avoid regurgitating wild, unsubstantiated rumours floating around in the blogosphere. But I'm willing to make an exception for the Financial Times, and if \"Oprah for London\" is good enough for the FT's <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/rachmanblog/2008/10/ambassador-oprah/\">international affairs guru Gideon Rachman</a>, then I think it's worth flagging up here.<br></p> <blockquote> <p>In London, the local interest centres around the question of who will be the next US ambassador to Britain. If Obama wins, the guessing-game centres around Caroline Kennedy, a prominent Obama supporter, who spoke at the Democratic convention in Denver \u2026 </p> <p>But there is also a far more interesting name doing the rounds than Caroline Kennedy - Oprah Winfrey. This is a bona fide rumour, put about by \"well-placed sources\". The argument is that Oprah is also a prominent supporter of Obama and that she might be looking for a \"change of direction\" - having got bored with her megastar status.</p> <p>It sounds ridiculous. It probably is ridiculous. But she would certainly cause a stir.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>I was headed into my local grocer in Durham, <a href=\"http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/nchome\">North Carolina</a> last weekend when I saw a startling sight. A pickup truck of early 1990s era was in the carpark, and scrawled across the side of it in big, carefully-lettered permanent marker were the words \"Southern White Hard-Working Beer-Drinking Gun-Owning White Man In His 50s FOR OBAMA!\", with the last two words <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/16/race-wedge-issues-fall-fl_n_135245.html\">drawn about eighteen inches high</a>.</p> <p>Now, it isn't uncommon for a man to deface his beloved pickup truck in the South, especially when he is passionate about a cause. This isn't to say that we don't revere the iconic pick-up truck much the way that some nomads revere horses or camels. It's as much an economic issue as anything \u2013 a man with a pick-up truck won't starve, ever. But as such, most truck-owning Southerners treat their vehicles like prized thoroughbreds \u2013 it takes a lot to bring a man to voluntarily deface it. When it does happen, it is a bold and powerful statement to the community.</p> <p>Usually a Nascar racing team is involved, or a local government agency who he feels has targeted him unfairly. Ex-wives frequently crop up on the sides of trucks \u2013 as do their lawyers \u2013 and especially after September 11, global Islamic terrorists and our war-weary troops have been the favourite subjects. And religious verse and iconography are not infrequent, either. Pickup trucks in the South are a kind of rolling marginalia, an eight-cylinder object d'art, a practical exercise of free speech on big tires.</p> <p>So when a Southern white man defaces his white truck in the name of an African American candidate for office \u2013 favourably \u2013 that is indeed worthy of note by us casual \"pickup truck spotters\".</p> <p>Admittedly, we are in a solidly-Democratic city with a large African-American population, with one of the <a href=\"http://www.duke.edu/\">most liberal private universities in the nation</a> and the South's second highest lesbian population. If you travel 50 miles in any direction from Durham, you emerge into the \"real\" rural South, famed in song, story and film for its quaint cultural attitudes, casual violence, extreme politeness and devout religious piety. And, of course, its racial insecurity.</p> <p>Race intrudes in just about every aspect of life in the American south that it becomes part of the atmosphere, like the water in a fishtank. I didn't really understand that myself until I traveled beyond the South and realized the difference. Once upon a time it would have been nigh unthinkable for a white man, no matter how liberal, to voice support for an African-American political candidate - period. After 30 years of consistent jabbing at the old Southern social order, such things are more common today. The \"Age of Obama\" has helped shake up the last vestiges of the old regime, however, and as we approach Election Day it's easy to see how the casual racism that used to be so overt in Dixie can be so easily exhumed.</p> <p>The danger to the Obama campaign in the South has always been racial in nature \u2013 and his campaign has done its best to distance itself from the traditional southern African American political machines (which are just as corrupt and effective as the white Republican political machines) while still energizing the base they represent. It's been a delicate dance, and one made harder by his middle name and African heritage. Militant \"Black Muslims\" have always been a boogey-man to ignorant white voters in the South, and damning Obama by implication is second nature to his opponents here. They nearly salivated over the inflammatory Jeremiah Wright video, figuring it was an open-and-shut condemnation that would keep the region safely red this year.</p> <p>Not so fast.</p> <p>The race card has been continuously played here for 200 years, now, and used to effect political change, usually by wealthy white people. It has led to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington_Insurrection_of_1898\">only successful coup d'etat in American history</a>, the deaths of thousands by lynching, the disenfranchisement of a good 20% of the population, and a racially-based caste system that took decades to overthrow. Today it leaves behind a residue that is all-too-apparent in this presidential race.</p> <p>Sometimes it's blatant. \"You're just supporting Obama because of white guilt,\" one woman of my parents' generation accuses me. \"They are trying to make you feel bad because of slavery!\" she whines. She's voted Democratic in every election I've voted in, but she's suddenly become a conservative Republican, now that McCain is facing a black man. My protests about the race-neutral issue of a trillion dollars spent on our foreign wars meaning more to me than four centuries of racial injustice fall on deaf ears. To her, the only reason a sane white Southerner would ever support an African American for president is because of racial guilt.</p> <p>Sometimes it's slightly more subtle. Another lady from my church, one I privately called \"the Right Arm Of God\" - not because of her observed piety, I should probably point out, but for her excessive zeal in protecting her daughter's virtue - is upset that I've been vocal in support of Obama in public where people can see. \"I hope you'll use that intellect to get the right man elected,\" she cautions me. I don't need to be a genius to figure out what she means.</p> <p>But sometimes you find relief from the ignorance in unexpected places. Like when my brother-in-law, a deputy sheriff, epitome of Southern conservative power, pulled into my driveway and nodded to my Obama sticker. \"I'm gonna vote for that sumb*tch,\" he expressed, colourfully. \"Looks like McCain's gonna be another term for George Bush, and I'd rather vote for a damn Muslim negro than that.\" And no, he didn't use the word \"negro\". It was the same day I saw that pick-up truck with the proud pro-Obama message.</p> <p>Baby steps.</p>",
  "<p>Much ago has been made about Christopher Buckley's mutually agreed-upon departure from the National Review, the important conservative magazine his father, William F. Jr., founded back in the 1950s. In case you've been on Neptune -- Buckley endorsed Obama; he offered NR his resignation (he's not on payroll per se, but was a a regular contrib), and NR accepted it.</p> <p>Mind you I think NR has become a redoubt of paranoid insanity in many cases. Some of the stuff they publish on The Corner is stuff I wouldn't say to my shrink or my priest (if I had either, which I don't). I've been reading it for the better part of 20 years, but I actually let my subscription lapse a year or two ago because I thought it was too often crossing the line from stating philosophical principle to advancing party propaganda, which is the line all ideological magazines, left and right, must navigate with care and integrity.</p> <p>That said, the editors had every right to let Buckley go. It's an opinion journal. An opinion journal makes no promise to represent points of view it strongly disagrees with. In fact it largely makes its readers the <em>opposite </em>promise. If a writer veers too far away from the magazine's house line, letting that writer go is within the rules. And supporting a liberal Democrat for president is a pretty big veer for a conservative magazine. </p> <p>It is the job of opinion journals to publish robust intra-family debate -- for example, if the election turns out the way it seems it's going to, NR and the Weekly Standard will have a duty to publish lots of different views, featuring internal disagreements, on how the GOP and conservatism pick themselves up off the floor. But it seems to me totally fine to have accepted Buckley's graciously offered resignation.<br></p>",

  "<p>With fuel prices sky-high and stock prices rock-bottom, energy and economics have inevitably dominated this year's US presidential race. The phrases \"climate change\" and \"environment\" have cropped up here and there, but usually just as a footnote to statements that are really about energy security. (See the candidates' voting records <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/environment/2008/oct/20/network-uselections2008\">here</a>.)</p> <p>There was one question about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/09/environment.climatechange.uselection\">global warming </a> in the second televised debate, but for the most part there's been little to go on when trying to determine whether Barack Obama or John McCain is greener.</p> <p>Of course, either of the two candidates would be an environmental improvement over George Bush. But given that the US could make or break a meaningful deal to tackle climate change at next year's Copenhagen summit, an improvement isn't really enough.</p> <p>To help better understand the two candidates' eco-credentials, we've enlisted the help of our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/network\">Guardian Environment Network</a> partners at Grist, who have been tracking the green aspects of the campaign trail.</p> <p>Below is Grist's summary of where the wannabe presidents stand on the main environmental issues.

  "<p>A weekend of good news for the Obama campaign reached its high point yesterday in the endorsement of Colin Powell, George Bush's former secretary of state, who used a Sunday morning talkshow to heap praise on a man he called a \"transformational figure\", saying America needed a \"generational change\". Courteously phrased though it was, Powell's endorsement represented a harsh repudiation of the McCain campaign, Dan Glaister writes in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/19/colin-powell-endorses-barack-obama\">Guardian</a>: the four-star general specifically criticised his fellow Republican's focus on Bill Ayers, and the spate of fiercely negative anti-Obama \"robocalls\" reported around the country. (\"Mr McCain says that he's a washed-out terrorist,\" Powell said. \"Well, then, why do we keep talking about him?\") The McCain campaign, wisely, responded by attacking Obama rather than Powell. \"Only an unproven and inexperienced politician like Barack Obama would have to rely so heavily on an another man's resume in making the case for his own candidacy,\" said spokesman Tucker Bounds, \"and it shows that he's just not ready.\"</p> <p>Powell's backing means much because of his military and foreign-policy credentials, of course, and his prior service in a Republican administration. Perhaps even more importantly, though, it gave the Obama campaign an adrenaline shot - and a set of fresh positive headlines - at a time when the greatest danger it faces may be a loss of energy amid sustained poll leads. That was also true of yesterday's news that the Obama campaign had raised a record-breaking $150m in September, far exceeding his previous record of $65m in August. Meanwhile, on Saturday, Obama attracted the largest crowd of the campaign, when an estimated 100,000 people attended a rally in Missouri. As we enter the last two full weeks before the election, Obama's momentum is apparently unflagging. How will McCain - who likes stunts and surprises, as you may have noticed - choose to respond?</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama is in Florida and Colorado; McCain is in Missouri; Sarah Palin is in Colorado. (Joe Biden has no events scheduled.) Along with more reaction to the Powell endorsement, expect further vociferous debate over the Republican \"robocalls\"; they're now drawing criticism from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/20/obama-mccain-election-ohio-carolina\">across the political spectrum</a>, with many noting they were exactly the tactics used by George Bush to help sink McCain's presidential campaign in 2000.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>In the first tracking polls based solely on data collected after the final debate, Obama's lead remains essentially steady. The latest results of the Gallup daily tracking poll are Obama 51%, McCain 44% among likely voters (though among \"traditional likely voters\", a measure that factors in participation in past elections, the margin is only 49%-46%). Rasmussen's poll of likely voters is at 51%-45%. An ABC News/Washington Post poll over the weekend found that 36% of likely voters had a better opinion of Obama after the debates, compared to 12% who had a worse one; McCain left 26% thinking less of him and 20% thinking more highly.</p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>In an interesting moment on Fox News Sunday, McCain is asked whether he could live with losing the election, and chooses not to dodge the question: \"Oh, sure ... I've got a wonderful life. I have to go back and live in Arizona and be in the United States Senate representing them, and with a wonderful family, and daughters and sons that I'm so proud of, and a life that's been blessed.\"</p> <h2>On theguardian.com</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/20/uselections2008-barackobama\">Video: 'Obama is a liar' - gun owners sound off</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/19/colin-powell-endorses-barack-obama\">Michael Tomasky: A friendly nod from a familiar face</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/20/us-elections-get-out-the-vote-rally\">Video: 'Our generation will have to pay for the war and the bail-out'</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/poll/2008/oct/19/colin-powell-obama-poll\">Poll: Does Colin Powell's endorsement help Barack Obama?</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/20/uselections2008-barackobama\">Charlie Brooker: CNN's voter approval graph turned the presidential debate into a computer game.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/colin-powell\">Colin Powell's</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/20/barack-obama-colin-powell\">endorsement</a> of Barack Obama was not \u2013 as some Republicans will no doubt claim and as right-wing broadcaster <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=a4CaggJflak\">Pat Buchanan suggested</a> in an interview on MSNBC today - a tribal effort, based on a sense of racial solidarity to another African-American. Nor was it an attempt by Powell to jump on-board the Obama bandwagon. </p> <p>To be frank, if Powell felt a sense of racial obligation he probably would not have joined the Republican party in the first place \u2013 there is little love lost between most African-Americans and the party. Secondly, as one of the most senior political figures in the country, Powell has absolutely no need for extra attention or to bask in Obama's reflected glory. </p> <p>His endorsement was instead - as demonstrated by the poignant and well-thought-out analysis Powell gave on Sunday's Meet The Press - the decision of a man who is deeply troubled by the direction of his party, worried that it has \"moved further to the right\" and become \"narrower and narrower\" to the point where it is not adequately addressing the concerns of the American people. </p> <p>As Powell lucidly articulated his thoughts on the current state of the Republican party, John McCain's reaction to the economic crisis, the negative way in which McCain's campaign has been run, and his feelings about Sarah Palin - \"a distinguished woman\" who he doesn't believe is \"ready to be president of the United States, which is the job of the vice-president\" - it was obvious this was by no means a rash pronouncement. </p> <p>Powell echoed what many of us have been thinking. But while we all have our own opinions, hearing such statements from Powell is simply more profound. having served as secretary of state for four years and having been a central cog in the Republican wheel, if anyone should know what is required of a president and who is best for the job he should. </p> <p>While high profile endorsements, of which Obama has many, generally make little difference to voters, a <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_20082/2008_presidential_election/colin_powell_most_valuable_endorsement\">Rasmussen report published back in February</a> found that an endorsement by Colin Powell was the \"most valuable\" and the <em>only</em> one that would have a significant net positive impact on voters. Some 28% of the electorate said they would be more likely to vote for a candidate that Powell had endorsed. It is likely that Powell's endorsement will have an effect on those all-important undecided voters as well as other, more moderate, Republicans who are also concerned about some of the issues that Powell mentioned. </p> <p>The Republicans would do well to pay attention to Powell's criticisms. It should not only be troubling to them that a significant member of the party should not have enough faith in them to lead the country for another term, it also raises questions about the Republican brand and what it means to be a conservative these days \u2013 particularly in light of some of the <a href=\"http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2008/10/rep_michele_bachmann_tells_chr.html\">negative campaigning coming from Republicans</a> \u2013 as well as the party's future direction. </p> <p>Powell said things that only a Republican could say in order to be taken seriously. Finally, he properly addressed the issue about Obama's faith, setting out the real question: that even if Obama were to be a Muslim, \"Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country?\" It did not go unnoticed that when a woman told John McCain at a recent rally that she wouldn't vote for Obama because he was an \"Arab\", McCain's response was \"No, ma'am. He's a decent family man\" \u2013 as if being Arab and decent are mutually exclusive. Until now, very few people have questioned the assumption that there is something intrinsically wrong with being a Muslim or an Arab. Powell must be commended for publicly challenging the ugly nature of that assumption. </p> <p>Powell's words were also important because they highlighted his belief in the need for gravitas in politics \u2013 something which the Republicans appear to have had a disdain for during this campaign. Throughout the campaign Obama has been continuously attacked for being an elitist with lofty rhetoric, with the implication being that having a presidential candidate who is educated and intelligent is a bad thing. </p> <p>The Republicans have attempted to sell a notion that a presidential or vice presidential candidate should be of average intelligence or ability, seemingly forgetting that the capacity to reason well, deal with abstract concepts, show excellent discernment and engage in complex debate and discussions on a level well beyond that which the average person is used to is part of a president's job. It's incredible, for example, that Sarah Palin is unable or unwilling to do interviews with the media, yet is <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hw7ywJw6xkvlPRxSINVIWAMIq9NAD93TUMRG0\">happy to appear on the comedy show Saturday Night Live</a>. </p> <p>It was, therefore, encouraging to hear Powell praise Obama's \"steadiness \u2026 intellectual curiosity \u2026 depth of knowledge\" and \"intellectual vigor.\" He, unlike other members of his party, seems determined that dubious associations, identity politics and irrelevant issues should not overshadow the fact that being the US president is a serious job which requires a serious candidate, particularly at this moment. </p> <p>Colin Powell's endorsement also underscored the point \u2013 often forgotten due to the <a href=\"http://www.thepoliticalbrain.com/videos.php\">emotional nature of voting</a> \u2013 that the decision regarding who to vote for should be based on who is best for the job \"right now\", and that the thought process that goes into making that decision should consider \"which is the individual that serves the needs of the nation for the next period of time?\". </p> <p>Powell has not defected from his party. He remains a Republican although he is no doubt aware that this endorsement will make him unpopular within Republican circles. His endorsement was, therefore, courageous. He cares about America, and it is by voting for Obama that he feels he is properly putting \"country first\". Palin and McCain should be proud of him.</p>",
  "<p>The presidential election is having an immediate impact on American classrooms and lecture halls. </p> <p>The battle between Barack Obama and John McCain has led two states to ban teachers and lecturers from showing their political allegiance in class.</p> <p>In Illinois, Obama's home state, the state university ethics office barred faculty members from wearing campaign badges, putting bumper stickers on their cars and attending political rallies on campus. </p> <p>The New York department of education sent a memo two weeks ago saying it would enforce a regulation on neutrality that has been on the books for more that 20 years. </p> <p>The United Federation of Teachers union filed a lawsuit alleging that teachers' constitutional right to free speech had been violated. A judge disagreed and upheld a ban on badges in the classroom, but allowed teachers to distribute materials among themselves and put posters up in areas off limits to students. </p> <p>The curb came, say sources close to the case, after several school principals complained about an email from the UFT - which overtly supports Obama - to union leaders in schools advising them how to distribute campaign materials. </p> <p>\"Keeping politics out of the classroom was our primary concern here, and our position has been fully vindicated,\" said schools chancellor Joel I Klein after the ruling in the department's favour.</p> <p>\"We don't want students feeling intimidated because they might hold a different belief or support a different candidate than their teachers,\" a statement from the department said.</p> <p>The curb on badge-wearing highlights how emotive this year's election is - the regulation wasn't enforced in the 2004 election because there simply weren't any complaints. </p> <p>\"I don't see the problem,\" said one teacher who asked not to be named. \"It's not like we're putting propaganda out there - these kids are smart enough not to be swayed by a button or a poster. And if it makes one senior go out and vote any way at all it's worth it.\"</p> <p>Cary Nelson, President of the American Association of University Professors, and an emeritus professor at the University of Illinois argued that honesty from lecturers could aid learning in universities.</p> <p>\"The fear is that it would be coercive to reveal our views to students,\" he said. \"But our students now arrive much more sophisticated, with political ideas that they're pretty resilient in. This century-old notion that they're malleable or blank slates isn't true any more.\"</p> <p>\"The people who made that decision have no more knowledge of what goes on in classroom or on campus than a pig has of Sunday,\" he said. \"There is not a single PhD or faculty member on the committee.\"</p> <p>He deliberately wore a campaign badge (supporting Obama) to a lecture after the ban was handed down in order to spark argument about the regulation. </p> <p>\"If you can do a good job of disagreeing with me,\" he says of his classes, \"you get extra credit. They understand where I'm coming from, but I also encourage open debate.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong>Barack Obama</strong> is winning the US newspaper endorsement battle over <strong>John McCain</strong> by a margin of more than three to one. According to <a href=\"http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003875230\">the latest <strong>Editor &amp; Publisher</strong> count</a>, Obama has the backing of 105 papers compared to 33 for McCain.</p> <p>Many of the titles supporting Obama are the dominant papers in major cities - such as Boston, Chicago, Pittsburgh and San Francisco - and he has picked up several papers that gave Bush their backing in the last election. </p> <p>A <strong>HuffingtonPost</strong> analysis <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-mitchell/why-obamas-shocking-lands_b_136010.html\">by <strong>Greg Mitchell</strong> </a> says the switches to Obama include Republican party stalwarts like the <strong>Chicago Tribune</strong> (which has never previously endorsed a Democrat), the <strong>Houston Chronicle</strong>, the <strong>Denver Post</strong> and the <strong>New York Daily News</strong>. </p> <p>Mitchell notes that \"one paper after another cites <strong>Sarah Palin</strong> as clearly unqualified to be president.\" Does that mean that McCain's running mate is <em><strong>the</strong></em> defining issue in the election?

  "<p>It's a crisp, sunny morning in Colorado Springs. We've decided to spend another day in this mile-high Rocky Mountain city, soaking up some of its renowned conservative Christian spirit while we await the arrival of Sarah Palin tomorrow morning. It being Sunday, some of us have decided to go to church - and not just any church. At 10:00 we head out toward the expansive \"campus\" of <a href=\"http://www.newlifechurch.org/\">New Life Church</a>, located on the outskirts of town a stone's throw away from the US Air Force Academy and beneath the looming presence of Pike's Peak. </p> <p>As huge as it is, this isn't the largest evangelical mega-church in America, but it is probably the most famous and it certainly has been the most influential: Its founder and former pastor, Ted Haggard, headed the National Association of Evangelicals and reportedly had a <a href=\"http://www.therevealer.org/archives/timely_001945.php\">direct line </a>to the Bush White House\u2014right up to the moment when he <a href=\"http://coloradoindependent.com/904/pastor-who\">was caught </a>buying meth and having sex with a male prostitute in 2006. <br> When we arrive at the enormous \"Worship Center,\" the lobbies are bedlam, as busy as Grand Central Station during any rush hour. Parents are lining up at check-in counters to drop off their kids for Sunday school sessions before rushing into a space that looks more like a high-tech concert hall than a church, with elaborate sound systems, TV cameras, screens scrolling Biblical texts, and a backdrop that changes from light blue to crimson to a simulacrum of a traditional church, stained glass and all. Two armed city cops stand guard at the door: Last December, a young man who had been bounced out of a missionary training program in Denver <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7140409.stm\">opened fire </a>at the end of a service here, killing two and wounding two others. </p> <p>By 11:00 sharp the hall, which has a <a href=\"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_/ai_n10043749\">capacity of 7,500</a>, looks packed. The New Life congregation alone numbers over 12,000. And this weekend Colorado Springs's other famous fundamentalist institution, James Dobson's <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2109621/\">Focus on the Family</a>, is hosting a <a href=\"http://www.ndptf.org/summit/\">National Day of Prayer Summit</a>, timed to take place \"just days before our national and local elections\" because, its organizers say, \"As we look over our country, we see a land in need of the Savior, Jesus Christ,\" and they want the faithful to \"pray and intercede with fellow believers for this critical hour in which we live.\" </p> <p>People like myself, brought up to expect the solemnn silence that settles over mainline protestant churches as the parishioners file in and the service begins, were ill prepared for what we would experience here. The parade of people flowing in looks more like they are attending a football game: Young women with low-cut blouses, men in shorts, their bellies bursting out of tee shirts, a Vietnam vet in a motorcycle jacket with the word \"Sniper\" boldly etched on it. There are very few suits. There are even fewer non-white faces: I spot one black person, a couple of Asian Americans and Latinos. The crowd is loud and ebullient, filling the aisles with chatter. I hear one woman giving another advice about helping an injured rabbit. A third companion chimes in that the Parables can be a big help when dealing with animals.</p> <p>Suddenly, all hell - so to speak - breaks loose. The lights dim, and the nine-piece Desperation Band lays down the Christian beat, singing, \"You are greater, greater than the fight that rages for my life.\" Standing on risers behind the rock band, a choir of some 70 people sways in unison. Most in the audience are on their feet, hands stretched upwards in the Pentecostal reach towards God. Many ecstatic parishioners begin to dance in place. They remain standing for a good half hour while the band bangs out one tune after another. Finally it stops, and they gratefully collapse into their chairs. A preacher appears and asks everyone to take their minds off their financial problems and apply a magnifying glass to God - and fork over some money to the church. Men with white plastic buckets make their way through the aisles. Some people put in change or bills, but a surprising number give nothing.</p> <p>Another preacher appears and begins to talk about all the great things the church is doing, and how he himself has it on for the people of the Ukraine, a post-Communist country that, as he describes it, badly needs their help. He prays for the Ukranians for a while, then moves on to the natives of the Amazon rainforest, whom some of the congregants will soon be visiting on what sounds like a combination of missionary work and exotic vacation. We leave before the end of the service, and as we head off of the New Life grounds, we pass a group of men standing at the roadside, waving big Sarah Palin signs. They give us a fistful of tickets for Monday morning's rally. </p> <p>Palin is sure to feel the love when she speaks to the crowd here in the city that has been described as the \"Evangelical Vatican.\" But she will be, literally, preaching to the converted. And it turns out even the conservative evangelicals aren't united behind the Republican Party the way they used to be: In a <a href=\"http://egan.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/my-own-private-focus-group/?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=\" rss\"\">recent interview </a>the current New Life pastor, Brady Boyd, cited the financial crisis as \"point number one,\" and said: \"The only advice I give is pray, fast and vote, and that can be for any political party...What's happening to us is less allegiance to the Republican party, and more to our core principles.\" </p> <p>Others on the Christian right <a href=\"http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/Sep/02/palin-no-stranger-focus-family/\">remain steadfast </a>to the GOP. But the fact that the ticket is losing despite the addition of Sarah Palin clearly proves something: While conservative Christians may be a formidable force in American politics, they can't elect a president by themselves. The right-wing evangelicals joined a Republican coalition that also included libertarians, hawkish neocons, working-class \"Reagan Democrats,\" and old-fashioned fiscal conservatives. And some of these are now leaving the flock in favor of what Christopher Buckley, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/2008/10/10/buckley_bails/index.html?source=\" rss\"\">endorsing Obama</a>, called a \"first-class temperament and a first-class intellect.\" It's quite something to be judged too erratic or too stupid by people who once supported George W. Bush - but in some minds, McCain and Palin seem to have achieved that dubious distinction.</p>"
