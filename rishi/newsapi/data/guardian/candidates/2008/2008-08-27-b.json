  "<p>I spent part of Wednesday afternoon at a meeting arranged by Time magazine with Obama campaign manager David Plouffe. He and deputy Dan Pfeiffer answer questions for about an hour. About 50 journalists attended.</p> <p>Bottom line? I was mildly reassured. But only mildly. Plouffe exudes a serene confidence about the get-out-the-vote operation that he is in charge of building \u2013 and an unsettling lack of either awareness or concern about the campaign's two major problems in recent weeks: its absence of a central and compelling economic message, and the beating Obama has been taking from the McCain camp's attacks. Either he knows a lot of stuff I don't, or he's fooling himself a little.</p> <p>Plouffe spent about the first 15 minutes talking about his field operation, and returned to the subject several times over the remaining 45 or so minutes. He said the campaign is focused on 18 states. They're especially concentrating on people he called \"true undecideds\" \u2013 people who aren't leaning one way or the other. The demographics of the true undecideds are favourable, he says: \"We like where they are and who they are.\"</p> <p>He argued that turnout in November will be high, and therefore, McCain \"has to improve on the Bush 2004 numbers.\" He said, two or three different times, that he thinks it will be almost impossible for McCain to do that, because Karl Rove built a formidable turnout machine and spent a lot of time on turnout, while he sees no evidence that the McCain campaign is doing that, while the Obama team has already been working on this for months. \"One thing we never run into out there is a John McCain field organization,\" he said. This was the single most striking sentence of the event \u2013 you could hear people scrambling to write it down and remarking on it to the people sitting next to them. </p> <p>He turned many questions back to the field operation. For example, Jay Carney of Time asked whether there were any second thoughts about moving Obama's speech to the football stadium, given some of the criticisms. Pfeiffer said \"no second thoughts.\" Plouffe kept talking about the Invesco Field move as an organizing tool, noting that all the regular Coloradans who will be able to attend have committed to going back into their towns and working hard through Nov. 4. In Colorado and everywhere, he said, \"We're going to turn out a lot more votes than John Kerry.\"</p> <p>He framed the contest as being about field operation vs. news cycle. \"Their campaign,\" he said, referring to McCain's, \"is all about winning the news cycle.\" He said his campaign's constant research shows that voters listen more to people in their communities they know and trust than they listen to attack ads or blowhards on television.</p> <p>Well, it's all well and good. I don't doubt for a minute that the Obama ground game will be more formidable than any we've recently seen. On the other hand, the news cycle does matter, and Obama has lost about 23 out of the last 30 of them. Plouffe was not directly asked about this (I tried but time ran out), and it's true that \"message\" is really David Axelrod's department, not his.</p> <p>But let me put it this way. The last 30 days have been very rough ones for this campaign. After running a tight and smart and brilliant primary campaign, they have seemed badly off their game ever since Obama returned from Europe \u2013 when the heavy McCain attacks started. The McCain campaign has effectively undercut some of the basic presumptions of Obama's candidacy. The Obama team has not seemed aware at times of how badly they appear to have been hurt. Plouffe didn't discuss this at all and even said the McCain's personality attacks \"harm him with swing voters.\" He also didn't really have an answer when Joe Klein asked a question about the positive message the team is crafting on the economy.</p> <p>Plouffe said this is all about \"who's got the most credible path to 270\" electoral votes. That's undoubtedly true. But traditionally, a superior turnout operation is worth 2%. Even if Obama's is worth 5%, that still means he needs to be within five points in Virginia and Ohio and Colorado and so on for the field operation to lift him over the top. And that means he has to craft a strong message and win more news-cycle knife fights than he's been winning. We'll get more answers to these questions Wednesday and Thursday nights. For whatever it's worth, Plouffe came off as a man who wasn't overly concerned.</p>",
  "<p>Backed by hundreds of demonstrators, an anti-war veterans group began marching toward the Democratic convention hall today to press Barack Obama into supporting a quicker US withdrawal from Iraq.</p> <p>The protest, organised by Iraq Veterans Against the War (IVAW), was not approved by the city of Denver. Trucks of armed police in riot gear were dispatched to watch closely for any eruptions of violence.</p> <p>Garett Reppenhagen, a US army sniper who served in Kosovo and Iraq, said the march aimed to prod Obama and the Democrats into making good on their campaign-trail promises to end the war.</p> <p>\"He goes to Iraq to do PR stunts to build his credibility on the war, but he's afraid to come home and face anti-war veterans,\" Reppenhagen said. \"I'm not voting for hope. I want practical solutions.\"</p> <p>The IVAW march is slated to culminate at the Pepsi centre, the heavily guarded convention arena, but law enforcement is likely to halt the trek before it reaches downtown Denver. Reppenhagen said the police were \"working with us\" but could not say how far protesters would get.</p> <p>In a further complication for the marchers, many in the boisterous, sign-waving crowd came out more for Rage Against the Machine than rage against Obama's war policy. </p> <p>The popular rock band played a free concert that was timed to end just as the anti-war protest began, encouraging music fans to join in and confront the Democrats. Asked what inspired him to march, one 26-year-old demonstrator shrugged, \"I've got nothing to do today.\"</p> <p>Demonstrations at this week's convention have proven more low-key than early forecasts predicted, although police fired pepper spray into a crowd on Monday night before arresting 100 people for blocking the streets.</p> <p>\"Many [in the crowd] were observed carrying rocks and other items that could be used to threaten public safety,\" the city police said in a release on the arrests.</p> <p>Yesterday saw 18 more arrests, bringing the total for convention week to 135. The biggest controversy arose over videotape showing a Denver police officer pushing a young female anti-war protester, Alicia Forrest, to the ground with no apparent provocation. </p> <p>The officer later arrested Forrest when she began telling reporters about the confrontation. She was released from jail this morning.</p>",
  "<p>...Aaaand we're back, just in time to note that, pursuant to Section C8 of the Democratic Party Rules and Procedures, Barack Obama just won the convention's very carefully choreographed roll-call vote, during which the representatives of many state delegations boasted that their state was better than all the others, until finally Hillary Clinton stepped forward to end the voting and award the nomination to Obama by acclamation, and Nancy Pelosi, who was overseeing the ceremonies, asked those who agreed to say \"yay,\" and those who disagreed to say \"nay,\" but cleverly left no time at all for anyone to actually say \"nay\" before declaring that the motion had been passed, making Obama the official Democratic party nominee, and then everyone burst into tears and they played Love Train on the PA system and everyone was very happy, the end. They will continue to act elated until <strong>7pm Denver time, 9pm Eastern, 2am UK time</strong>, when Bill Clinton will step up to the stage and announce that he's running for president again, even though it's illegal.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337018355\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Barack Obama took his place in history tonight when the Democratic convention formally adopted him as their presidential nominee, the first African American to lead a major political party into election.</p> <p>Tonight's vote had been suspenseful, with the Obama camp concerned until the last moments it could emerge as a potential flashpoint for hardcore supporters of Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Instead, it became a raucous celebration of Obama's candidacy, punctuated by chanting of his campaign slogan, \"yes, we can\".</p> <p>In a carefully crafted piece of political theatre, Clinton emerged on the convention floor midway through the roll call vote to urge Democrats to embrace Obama as their nominee.</p> <p>\"Let's declare together in one voice right here, right now that Barack Obama will be our presidential nominee,\" she said.</p> <p>Clinton went on to call for a suspension of the vote and for Obama to be adopted by acclamation. Moments later, a roar went up from the convention floor and it was done.</p> <p>Tonight's events could at last bring closure to the Democrats' long and bitter primary campaign.</p> <p>The scene for the closing of ranks around Obama was set in motion earlier today when Clinton formally released her delegates, freeing them to vote for Obama.</p> <p>\"You've come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do,\" she told the crowd in emotional scenes. </p> <p>\"I want you to know that this has been a joy. Yes, we didn't make it. But, boy, did we have a good time.\"</p> <p>She did not go so far as to direct her followers how to vote, but as the traditional roll call of the states got under way, beginning with Alabama, it soon became apparent that most Democrats wanted to set the past aside, and focus on Obama's election battle against John McCain.</p> <p>Clinton's name was placed in nomination by the farm workers' leader, Dolores Huerta. Obama was nominated by an Iraq war veteran from Tennessee.</p> <p>Some Clinton supporters did register their support for their candidate, but it was clear within the opening minutes of the vote, but by far the greater majority had swung around behind Obama.</p> <p>Even Arkansas, which Clinton claims as her adopted state, rallied behind Obama, in a unanimous vote for his candidacy that drew huge whoops from the crowd.</p> <p>Obama also handily carried Kentucky, a state that had voted by huge margins for Clinton in what as then seen as a sign of his difficulty in appealing to white working-class voters.</p> <p>Tonight's nomination vote had been one of the most contentious issues between the Obama and Clinton camps.</p> <p>At first, the Obama camp had been uncertain about holding a vote at all. But the Clinton camp applied relentless pressure.</p> <p>Clinton argued that her disappointed supporters needed to be allowed to cast their votes for her as a form of \"catharsis\", and a number of activists started petition campaigns calling for a vote.</p>",
  "<p>In August 1980 Ronald Reagan kickstarted his first run for the White House with a speech at the annual fair of Philadelphia, a small town in Mississippi. It was an odd choice of location for such a high-profile event, just days after he had accepted his party's nomination as presidential candidate. A community of a few thousand people, Philadelphia is well off the beaten track. But as he spoke in front of an enthusiastic and all-white crowd, his purpose became clearer. He famously posed on stage in a rocking chair, Nancy on his knee, her shoes caked in Mississippi mud. Then he started addressing the crowd.</p> <p>He was in favour of states' rights, he said, earning a lusty cheer. That sounds innocent enough as a political statement, but made in the deep south it had resonance. It was a euphemism, widely recognised at that time, for support of southern racial segregation and opposition to the meddling anti-racism of the federal government.</p> <p>It would have been a controversial statement anywhere in the south. But to make it in Philadelphia's fairground was more than that. A little more than a mile away from where Reagan spoke was the mound of earth where 16 years previously three young civil rights activists had been found buried, each one with a single shot through the heart. The men had been investigating an African-American church that had been burned to the ground by the Ku Klux Klan. Their murders, later immortalised in the Hollywood film Mississippi Burning, provoked nationwide revulsion and helped to secure the passage of Lyndon Johnson's civil rights act and with it the dismantling of southern segregation.</p> <p>Given the location, Reagan's clarion call for states' rights was a bold and deeply cynical move. As the liberal commentator Paul Krugman has put it: \"Everyone got the message.\"</p> <p>And the message stuck. It helped convert southern whites, the so-called Dixiecrats who had backed the Democratic party for decades, to defect to Reagan's cause, securing him victory in 1980 and completing the Republican stranglehold on the south that remains firm to this day. Mississippi has voted Republican in every presidential election since Reagan entered the White House. In 2004, John Kerry carried not a single southern state. </p> <p>But now something is in the air. In March the unthinkable came to Philadelphia, in the form of a politician who has dubbed himself \"a black man with a funny name\" and who won the Democratic primary in Mississippi by a landslide: Barack Obama.</p> <p>His victory in this quintessential corner of the deep south has brought back to the surface questions of race and allegiance that have to some degree been suppressed or reconciled over the years. For the 40% of the town's 7,000 residents who are black, it is evidence that change - so long in coming - is on its way. But it has put the white leadership of the local Republican party, as one party member told me, into a tailspin. \"The combination of Obama's liberal record, his middle name, Hussein, and his blackness - those three things are enough to put an elderly southern conservative into a state of shock.\"</p> <p>Tonight, on the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's famous \"I have a dream\" speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial, Obama will present America with his own dream speech. But as he does so, the racial divisions that he hopes to transcend remain unclear. How much has the country moved on from the dark days of segregation? Are towns like Philadelphia now free of their past? </p> <p>Despite the ugly symbolism of the town's history, today it looks outwardly transformed. The Confederate flag still flies in the central square as part of the Mississippi banner, but those other hallmarks of segregation - the separate drinking fountains, hospital waiting rooms, \"coloured\" sections at the back of the bus - are, of course, long gone. The schools are technically, if not practically, integrated; black businesses have opened up in the central square; even the local country club opened its doors to black members five years ago.</p> <p>Stan Dearman has observed the gradual sea-change with a semi-outsider's eye. He moved to the town in 1966, about 18 months after the murders, to take up editorship of the local paper, the Neshoba Democrat. \"I was hoping that most of the turmoil in this community was behind us, but it was just starting. It was like a cancer in the whole community. It wouldn't go away no matter how much people wanted it to.\"</p> <p>But over time, he's noticed the prevailing mood of the town grow less clannish, less insular. The conviction in January 2005 of Edgar Ray Killen, a local resident, on three counts of manslaughter - the first and only successful prosecution of a perpetrator of the 1964 killings - was a huge step forward in Dearman's view, though he says six or seven men are still out there \"who need to be brought before the bar of justice\".</p> <p>But it is striking that though Dearman thinks change has come to Mississippi, he doesn't think it will translate into an Obama victory, not in Philadelphia, at least. \"There's still a racial edge. People still see things in black and white - it's deeply ingrained. The mindset is: whites vote Republican, blacks Democrat.\"</p> <p>It is a sign of how the tectonic plates of race in the south are shifting that while Dearman, who is white, is sceptical about the extent of political movement, many of the black residents of Philadelphia are fired up, to use an Obamaism. James Young, 53, was of the generation put through state-enforced integration of schools, and bears the emotional scars to prove it. He remembers white kids hurling the N-word at him. He also recalls lying on the floor of his living room, his father with a gun in his hand, when the Klan were, in his words, \"on the move\".</p> <p>For years the black side of the tracks in Philadelphia, where he still lives, had a cloud over it that was part apathy, part despondency. \"If a black man stood for president you would just say, 'No way, no way'.\" Now, as a pastor in the local black church, he is exhorting the congregation to get out and register to vote.</p> <p>\"The generation that wouldn't contemplate a black president is passing on, and that's good for everybody. If it's not now, it's just around the corner. We will no longer be denied,\" he says. </p> <p>How important is that for African Americans in the south? </p> <p>\"It's a feeling you can't put into words. It's like we are no longer a subculture. Finally it's given us reason to think we are part of the overall scheme of things.\"</p> <p>That newfound optimism is reflected in voting trends in Mississippi. Until this year, the average turnout for a Democratic primary there would be about 90,000. In March it was 500,000, three-quarters of whom were black. In 2004, George Bush took the state with 670,000 votes to his name - suggesting that a huge turnout of black voters in November would give Obama a big bounce in Mississippi, a state with the highest proportion of African-Americans in the US (39%). That would certainly scare the Republican elders even more than they are already.</p> <p>But, of course, that still leaves the balance of power in the hands of the majority white voters. As Professor Marty Wiseman of Mississippi State University explains, race is no longer the number one issue for most white voters, but it remains an issue. \"Any Democratic candidate who gets a big turnout of black voters is off to a very good start. It's just getting that other 20% that's difficult.\"</p> <p>Philadelphia has changed; its ugly old ways are being shed. But this is evolution, not revolution, and some of the racial canker remains. Several people tell me that interracial relationships are no longer taboo. And then I meet Taneil Long. She is sitting in her nail salon in the central square, serving a black customer, the smell of varnish heavy in the air. In 2002, after she split up with the white father of her two daughters, she started dating a black man.</p> <p>\"I honestly thought this would be different - I mean, we're not in the 60s any more. But it really became a big issue for me,\" she says. </p> <p>The first thing she noticed was that her white clientele thinned out, to be replaced by a customer base largely comprising black women. Then her landlady turned on her, saying there had been complaints in her white neighbourhood about her boyfriend. \"I asked her was there a problem with the fact that he was black. She told me I had to get out.\" The father of her children recently told the girls he will never allow them to go out with black men.</p> <p>Long is herself mixed-race - part white, part Vienamese (her white father served in the Vietnam war), giving her a natural affinity to the mixed race Obama. And yet she is uncertain about him. \"You don't want a president with no connection to Christianity,\" she says.</p> <p>But he is a Christian, I reply, to her surprise.</p> <p>\"Really? I'd heard he was a Muslim.\"</p> <p>I'd been warned about this. Young had told me that in his pastoral work he found the Muslim question frequently popping up. But even so, it was a shock to find the false rumour, spread maliciously by Republican-leaning websites and gossipmongers, circulating so freely.</p> <p>It comes up in my chat with Steve Wilkerson, the affable white owner of a clothing shop, Steve's, on the square. He has worked hard for the past few years, together with black residents such as Young, to heal Philadelphia's troubled race relations. Wilkerson says he has received emails with such titles as \"Obama: the real story\", dwelling scurrilously on his supposed Muslim faith. He says there is much apprehension abroad. \"When you drive through white neighbourhoods I don't think you'll see many Obama signs or bumper stickers. People who vote for him will do it quietly. They don't know who he is, what his religion is. Is he the antichrist?\"</p> <p>Wilkerson himself is clearly conflicted. He knows Obama calls himself a Christian and says \"that's good enough for me. I'm not a judge.\" But later in our conversation he admits that he too is troubled. \"I'd like reassurance about who he is, who's backing him, just to be sure there's not an underlying current.\"</p> <p>What is his worst fear?</p> <p>\"That he does turn out to be a Muslim after all.\"</p> <p>And it comes up forcefully when I step in to Wilson's barber shop. Wilson is sitting looking slightly forlorn in the empty premises, clippings of hair scattered on the floor around his feet. \"I don't have anything against a black man as president,\" he begins. \"But Obama, he's not qualified. When you are president you represent everyone, not just your race. I've heard him talk about 'his people'.\"</p> <p>He goes on: \"And what about his religion, he can't just drop his religion.\" </p> <p>What do you mean, I ask. </p> <p>\"He's a Muslim.\"</p> <p>No, he's not. He's a Christian.</p> <p>\"Well, he should make it clear he stands by Christian values in America. That he doesn't hold those other values.\"</p> <p>But he has made that clear.</p> <p>\"I don't think he's done that at all. He's just run from it. He should have nipped it in the bud and made clear he's a president for everybody.\"</p> <p>But he's said that. What else can he do?</p> <p>\"Just because he's a Muslim, he should make it clear he doesn't believe in suicide bombing and killing.\"</p> <p>The prevalence in my admittedly unscientific survey of downtown Philadelphia of the Obama = Muslim myth helps explain the ongoing furore over race preoccupying the two presidential campaigns. Obama first sounded the alarm in June, saying he was preparing himself for underhand Republican tactics that would try to spread jitters among voters. \"They're going to try and make you afraid of me. He's young and inexperienced and he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black?\"</p> <p>That comment sank without trace, but when Obama repeated last month that the Republicans were trying to play up the fact that \"he doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills\", the McCain camp grabbed the ball and ran with it. A McCain aide accused Obama of playing the race card, from the bottom of the deck.</p> <p>Despite McCain's protestations that he is fighting an honest and race-blind campaign, Obama has good reason to be wary about the negative hits that are now coming at him from the rival camp. He knows all too well that the Swiftboat attacks that floored John Kerry, by calling into question his wartime record in Vietnam, were made by outrider groups that kept themselves scrupulously clean of Bush's fingerprints. There has been a creeping drift towards racial innuendo within McCain's increasingly venomous campaign. Attack ads run over the summer have shown Obama playing basketball - an overwhelmingly black sport in the US - and placed him in juxtaposition with Britney Spears and Paris Hilton in what some commentators have interpreted as a play on that old taboo on black men associating with sexualised white women. In one of his earliest ads, McCain referred to himself pointedly as \"the American president Americans have been waiting for\". That is an uncanny echo of the secret advice we now know was given to Hillary Clinton by her former chief strategist, Mark Penn, during the primary contest. In leaked memos, he urged her to portray Obama as someone whose \"roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited\".</p> <p>The Obama campaign is fighting back against this insidious and underhand play on his race by stressing all this week that his is a \"very American story\" - neatly turning on its head the message of his assailants. But that device is in part a recognition on his part that there is a problem. </p> <p>As the Democratic convention opened in Denver, opinion polls suggested that the clear lead he had held over McCain nationally for several weeks had all but slipped away, creating a palpable anxiety among Democratic supporters. They know that by August in their respective presidential election years - 1988 and 2004 - Michael Dukakis was 17 points ahead of George Bush Sr and John Kerry was four points ahead of George Bush Jr. And we know what happened to them.</p> <p>A growing chorus can be heard among pundits and pontificators. Is Obama's inability to pull away decisively from McCain, even though everything seems to be going in his favour, something to do with race? As John Heilemann, New York magazine's sharp political observer, has said: \"Call me crazy, but isn't it possible, just possible, that Obama's lead is being inhibited by the fact that he is, you know, black?\" </p> <p>Certainly, a closer look at the polls uncovers a stubbornly consistent racial divide. A recent Gallup poll had 91% of black voters backing Obama - indicating a nationwide trend in tune with Mississippi. Hispanics were keen on him too, with 68%. But non-Hispanic whites showed a clear preference for McCain, at 49% to Obama's 39%. When you factor in gender, the disparity is yet more glaring. White women came out evenly divided between the two candidates, but look at the findings for white men: McCain 55%, Obama 34%.</p> <p>That may not matter so much in the south, where white voters have - ever since Reagan's Philadelphia speech - tended to vote sheeplike for the Republicans anyway. But it could matter a lot in several northern states such as Ohio, Michigan or Pennsylvania where the contest is likely to be tight and where there is a preponderance of white working-class voters struggling in the economically stricken rust belt.</p> <p>That's the thing about many discussions of race in the US - they so easily overlook the north. The assumption is that the south was where the problem started with slavery and the civil war, while the north has always been a haven of enlightenment.</p> <p>But it is the north that today hosts the most segregated cities in the US. The most recent census in 2000 shows that nine out of the 10 most segregated cities are northern, including New York, Chicago, and Cleveland and Cincinnati in the crucial electoral battleground of Ohio. \"The northern system of segregation has never been about symbols of power on the streets - separate water fountains - but about segregated neighbourhoods and workplaces,\" says Kevin Boyle, a specialist in race and culture at Ohio State University. He reminds us that Obama struggled to gain support among white working-class communities in several northern states in the primary fight against Hillary Clinton, where issues of race and class are interwoven. In Ohio, almost one in five Democratic voters told exit pollsters that race had loomed large in their decision (Clinton won by 54% to 44%). \"States like Ohio are so close that just a couple of percent of voters who decide not to vote for him on grounds of race could swing the result,\" Boyle says.</p> <p>To see how the race factor is playing in these areas I fly 800 miles north from Philadelphia, to Livonia in Michigan. It was listed in the 2000 census as the whitest town in America. About 95% of its 100,000 residents are white and less than 1% black. The neighbouring town, Detroit, is more than 80% black - and the region as a whole sits at the top of the nation's segregation league table.</p> <p>So how do the residents of America's whitest town feel about a possible Obama presidency? Could they see him winning? \"I don't think he has a snowball's chance,\" says Glenn, sitting out on his front porch in one of Livonia's more affluent areas, reading the local paper. \"Not just because he's black - though that's a very good start - but because he has no experience.\"</p> <p>Livonia has acquired a reputation for racial tetchiness over the years. Plans to build two big shopping malls led to protests from some residents who feared they would attract \"Detroiters\" - a reference to the residents of Livonia's predominately black neighbour. A recent case, successfully prosecuted by federal authorities, fined a Livonia landlord more than $700,000 for refusing to rent apartments to black families. \"If blacks come in here, we really don't have anything available for them,\" the landlord told his employees, a clue perhaps to how Livonia has managed to stay so white over the years.</p> <p>A few doors down from Glenn, Eric is the only black resident in this part of town. He appears the perfect neighbour. His lawn is neatly trimmed, the brass on his gas lamp polished to mirror quality. About the only quibble one might have is that he has allowed his hostas to be nibbled by slugs.</p> <p>That hasn't stopped the grumbling. A couple of neighbours bluntly refuse to acknowledge him when passing on the street. One resident asked him if he were running a childcare scheme when some of his children's cousins stayed over. Another called the town authorities to complain he had a service vehicle in his drive, when other neighbours had much bigger trucks in theirs. He shrugs off these vexations: \"They don't hurt me or my family.\" As for Obama's chances, he says, \"Some people wonder what I'm doing here, let alone a black president of the United States.\"</p> <p>About a mile away from Eric's home is the blue-collar area of Roseland. It has the same detached houses and neatly trimmed lawns, except everything is scaled down. That's how it is in America: class as defined not by accent or breeding, but by square feet of real estate. It is in streets such as these that the economic downturn is really biting - rising food and petrol prices, job lay-offs, housing foreclosures. Jack, watering his plants in the front garden, says the hardship has to some extent led to a feeling of togetherness locally, even with his few black neighbours. But he goes on to say: \"A black president - that's a tough sell. Obama could be all right now, but come November people might say, 'Not yet'.\"</p> <p>And so to my final knock on a door. It is answered by Margaret, a grandmother who has a big sign in her window saying, \"Beware the Dog\", and a Stars and Stripes flying above the lintel. She grew up in Detroit but moved to Livonia as part of the white flight from the city in the 60s. She is proud of her Scottish parentage, and of her solid Democratic roots, but she is swift to tell me that Obama is not experienced enough for the White House. Not experienced enough. The phrase is starting to sound as widely used in Livonia as Muslim was in Philadelphia. Then she says: \"There's a lot of people who don't want a black man in the White House.\"</p> <p>It occurs to me that of all the people I have spoken to - both in Livonia and in Philadelphia, towns separated by 800 miles and a divergent history - it has always been the \"other people\" who won't vote for Obama. Not a single person has said they personally would balk at a black president.</p> <p>When she says there are a lot of people who don't want a black man in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, does that include her?</p> <p>Pause.</p> <p>\"Not really.\"</p> <p>Does \"not really\" mean yes or no?</p> <p>\"I wouldn't want to see it in my lifetime.\"</p> <p>A black presidency?</p> <p>\"I wouldn't like to see it, OK?\"</p> <p>She gives me a look of cold steel that announces the conversation is over.</p> <p>Margaret's rare blast of honesty provides closure of a sort to this journey around race and the presidential campain. But it would be wrong to leave it on such a note. At the age of 81, she is, after all, a product of the past more than an indication of the future. Despite Obama's narrow lead, he has crucial advantages over his opponent. He is hugely more charismatic and inspiring than McCain and he has energised his following in a way that the Republicans can only dream about. He also benefits from a historically unpopular Bush presidency and a tanking economy. If an Obama victory is by no means certain, it is a very healthy possibility.</p> <p>Let's return to Dearman, former editor of Philadelphia's local paper, who has lived through some of the country's most shameful moments, including Ronald Reagan's fairground speech, to see happier times. I ask him what he thinks the sight of Obama's two daughters, Malia and Sasha, playing on the White House lawn, would mean for America. \"It will be a big, big thing,\" he says. \"It would say that we, as a country, have arrived. There's a need for redemption, there always will be. An Obama presidency will provide some of that redemption.\"</p>",
  "<p>When the glorious waves of Barack Obama's rhetoric have washed over us, leaving us warm, tingling and refreshed like a Hawaiian surfer, we should remember King Canute. On the day Obama finally won the primaries, at the beginning of June, he declared that \"generations from now, we will be able to look back\" (those of us lucky enough still to be alive generations from now) and tell our children (as, presumably, they lean on their Zimmer frames) that \"this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal\". That set an Olympic record for hyperbole which even he will find hard to beat in his acceptance speech tonight. The 11th-century King Canute, by contrast, had his throne placed on the beach, commanded the ocean to stop coming in - and got his feet wet. He did this (the legend has it) precisely to show his supporters the limits of his power. But then Canute wasn't running for president.</p> <p>For the next 10 weeks, Obama must say whatever it takes to get elected, while not giving too many hostages to fortune. At this he's brilliant: a genius of the inspirationally unspecific. On the morning after, Canute will be called for. I suspect that, in his head if not in his heart, Obama knows this. His books and detailed policy documents show a nuanced understanding of the complexity of the world as it is. We may trust that he does not make the mistake of confusing his own rhetoric with reality, so nor should we.</p> <p>Hailing the Democrats' messiah as \"a clear-eyed pragmatist\" (not your usual tag-line for a messiah), his new-found running mate, Joe Biden, says a President Obama has a chance \"not just to change America but to change the world\". More surprisingly, that's what a lot of the world hopes too. Here's the true score. With a good deal of luck, and a massive turnout of volunteers and younger voters, Obama can be elected president, overcoming the electoral obstacles of being black, inexperienced, liberal, intellectual and tenderly \"supported\" by the Clintons. By just being elected, and being who he is, he would change both America and how the world sees America. Changing the world is another matter.</p> <p>Schmaltz is a staple ingredient of American politics, and there's no schmaltzfest more buttery than a Democratic convention. Yet what his wife Michelle said on Monday night, in an ur-schmaltzy speech, still contains a moving element of truth. That \"a girl from the South Side of Chicago and the son of a single mother from Hawaii\" could make it this far does represent everything that is good and hopeful about the US. After West Side Story, a world suffused with American popular culture thrills to South Side Story. </p> <p>Actually, it's two stories: his and hers, intermingled in their daughters, Malia and Sasha. When Americans say \"race\", they mean more than what we understand by that term in Europe. \"Race\" means the legacy of generations of slavery and of shockingly recent segregation. Obama accepts the nomination today on the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's \"I have a dream\" speech. Just 45 years ago, the basic equality of citizens was still only a dream. So story number one is how, in his immediate family, the descendants of slaves might occupy the White House. After Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice at the state department, this is the final frontier. Story number two is his own: the offspring of a mobile Kenyan father and white American mother, with family ties in many cultures. A child of our increasingly mixed-up world now standing to become the most powerful man in it.</p> <p>The most powerful - but less so, relatively, than most of his predecessors since 1945. For this, too, defines the Obama moment: that the relative power of the president of the United States of America has diminished, is diminishing, and will continue to diminish. Just consider what has been happening outside the American election bubble. In Georgia, Russia has cocked a snook at Washington and torn up the terms of the post-cold war settlement. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, Islamic extremists are growing stronger, not weaker, as we pay the price for George Bush's wild goose chase in Iraq. </p> <p>At the Beijing Olympics, China has trumpeted its peaceful re-emergence as a world power in spectacular fashion. Those massed acrobats, drummers and dancers, out-Hollywooding Hollywood in the Bird's Nest Stadium, sent a message more powerful than any Russian tanks. The world is getting the message, too. Even before the Olympic demonstration, the Pew Global Attitudes Project produced the remarkable results of an opinion poll asking respondents in 24 countries whether China will replace or has already replaced the US as the world's leading superpower. Few thought it already has, but roughly half the French, Germans, British, Spanish and Australians - not to mention the Chinese themselves - said it will. More striking still: so did one in three Americans. And in foreign affairs, as in financial markets, the perception is a large part of the reality.</p> <p>Meanwhile, world trade talks have collapsed, as developed and developing countries could not agree. We are way off target for meeting the UN's millennium development goals to help the world's poor and sick. The steps needed to reduce carbon emissions - above all, in the fast-growing economies of Asia - are not being taken. The ice caps go on melting. Nothing like enough is being done to slow the rise of the oceans. It's unclear how even a radical shift in American policy would change this now. Michelle Obama spoke eloquently of her husband's desire to shift \"the world as it is\" towards \"the world as it should be\". But Washington's capacity to do that is far less than it was in the 1940s, or even in the 1990s, when Bill Clinton was lucky enough to walk with history. </p> <p>The domestic strengths of the US are also not what they were. In the ongoing credit crisis of turbo-capitalism, flagship American banks run to the sovereign wealth funds of the Middle East and east Asia for help. East bails out West. The American housing market teeters on the verge of collapse. Jobs are hard to find. Middle-class Americans slide out of healthcare and into poverty. While hundreds of billions of dollars have been squandered in Iraq, and on Terminator IV hardware for the mightiest military the world has ever seen, anyone who spends time in the US can see how civil infrastructure is crumbling. This is not a country that can afford to \"pay any price, bear any burden\" - to recall the soaring rhetoric with which ailing senator Edward Kennedy's brother John once thrilled the world.</p> <p>America still has extraordinary strengths. Among the greatest of them is its ability to attract the brightest, most energetic and enterprising men and women from across the world, and then to give them the freedom and opportunity to use their talents to maximum effect. People like Barack Obama. As a man, Obama personifies the country's continued strengths. As a president, he will have to confront its growing weaknesses.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timothygartonash.com\">timothygartonash.com</a></p>",
  "<p>In ordinary times, US party nominating conventions are seamlessly produced public relations showcases for the already victorious candidate, culminating in the climactic razzmatazz of the acceptance speech on the final evening. This week's Democratic convention in Denver is all of that too. It is building towards tonight's open-air speech by Barack Obama in the city's football stadium - a speech eagerly awaited not just in America but around the world.</p> <p>But the Democrats have this week faced party management issues of unusual delicacy that perforce have made this convention unique. The long, close and often bitter battle between Mr Obama and Hillary Clinton inevitably framed much of the week's proceedings, right down to the sensitivity of last night's formal vote to adopt Mr Obama. The past could not be ignored so it had to be recognised. The interests of both victor and vanquished, and their passionate supporters, had to be respected but not indulged. The Denver convention has therefore demanded imaginative, magnanimous and conciliatory choreography on all sides to avoid it becoming a divisive event benefitting only the media and the Republicans.</p> <p>The Democrats have largely got what they required. In her speech on Tuesday, Mrs Clinton delivered unequivocally for Mr Obama. Her endorsement - \"Barack Obama is my candidate; and he must be our president\" - was emphatic. Her call to her supporters - \"the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose\" - was unambiguous. The rhetorical question that she posed to her delegates - \"Were you in this campaign just for me?\" - admitted of only one answer, that they must now to put the past behind them and rally behind Mr Obama in November. The only real question mark was whether Mr Obama had been wise not to put such a formidable campaigner on the ticket.</p> <p>Inevitably, Republican campaigners seized on the fact that Mrs Clinton did not specifically unsay the criticisms of Mr Obama she had made during the primaries. Naturally, journalistic scholars poring over the text were tempted to read her familiar repetition of Harriet Tubman's injunction to \"Keep going\" as a coded commitment to run again. Indisputably, Mrs Clinton's tart insistence on the achievements of her husband's administrations reflected irritation in their circle that Mr Obama had been insufficiently respectful towards the first Democrat since Franklin Roosevelt to win two terms in the White House. But only incorrigible Hillary-haters could listen to that speech and conclude she did not do the right and disciplined thing.</p> <p>In a perfectly managed world, the Democratic convention would all be about attacking Mr McCain and promoting Mr Obama. So there is no point pretending that the spotlight on the Clintons on the middle two nights of the convention has not had a political cost. Mr McCain is running strongly in the polls and his party is a ruthless foe. But the upside of the most inspiring of recent primary contests always carried with it the downside of a party with conflicted loyalties. If politics were just an advertising campaign, no one would want the rival to have any say at the convention. But politics, thank goodness, is messy and passionate. The system has to be big enough to accommodate real people with passionate disagreements. And in Denver the system proved that it could be.</p> <p>When Mrs Clinton ended her speech, the convention erupted in a spine-tingling roar of approval. The woman who had dreamed for so long of just such a roaring endorsement to her own campaign to be America's first female president waved for a few moments, then turned and quickly left the stage - a final small act of discipline. Was this, quickly followed by her husband's own speech, the last real bow of the Clintons in Democratic politics? It seems unlikely. Mrs Clinton has made sure she cannot be blamed if Mr Obama loses - but she has also proved that she will still be there if he does.</p>",
  "<p>Ken Livingstone, the former mayor of London, has found a new role as an adviser to the Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and his political allies. During a surprise visit to Caracas, Livingstone said yesterday that he would act as a consultant on the capital's policing, transport and other municipal issues.</p> <p>\"I believe that Caracas will become a first-world city in 20 years. I have a very extensive network of contacts both domestically and internationally which I will be calling on to assist in this,\" he told reporters at the presidential palace after meeting Ch\u00e1vez. </p> <p>The two socialist allies forged a deal last year to swap London's management expertise for subsidised fuel for London's buses. Boris Johnson, the Tory who ousted Livingstone in May's election, cancelled the deal and repaid \u00a37m to Venezuela, an oil giant with widespread poverty.</p> <p>No one doubts Caracas needs help. Gridlocked traffic, a crumbling centre, hillside slums, horrific murder rates, corrupt police and inept local government have made it one of Latin America's most notorious cities.</p> <p>No decision had been taken about a salary, said Livingstone. \"It depends to what extent we will be tapping into our individual resources. The whole cost of this trip has been paid for by the government of Venezuela and as an unemployed citizen I would not be able to pay for my own fare otherwise.\"</p> <p>The state media presented Livingstone as an important asset to pro-Ch\u00e1vez candidates in upcoming local elections. Livingstone seemed optimistic they would win. \"We have discussed with the candidates a programme they will take forward after the November elections,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Ukraine's president, Viktor Yushchenko, could not have put it more starkly. Condemning Russia's decision to recognise the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Georgia's two separatist regions, Yushchenko warned yesterday: \"Any nation could be next.\" </p> <p>In fact, Yushchenko was articulating what is now a commonplace in diplomatic circles: that having successfully \"done\" Georgia, the Kremlin might now turn its attention to Ukraine - and in particular its Russian-speaking region of Crimea.</p> <p>France's foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, said the same thing. \"It is very dangerous ... there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for Russia, in particular the Crimea, Ukraine and Moldova,\" Kouchner said. </p> <p>In reality, the similarities between Ukraine and Georgia, and the Crimea and South Ossetia, are largely superficial. Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula, has a strong ethnic Russian majority. It became part of Ukraine during Soviet times, when it was transferred to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1954.</p> <p>Unlike South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which launched separatist wars in the 1990s, Crimea has been a successful part of the Ukrainian state. \"It is very pro-Russian, especially in Sevastopol. But it doesn't see itself as being against Ukraine,\" Igor Shevliakov, from the International Centre for Policy Studies in Kiev, said.</p> <p>He added: \"There is no conflict between Crimea and Ukraine. Crimean politicians like to speculate on the Russian topic. But it doesn't seem they are really interested in becoming part of Russia. They are more interested in keeping their own control over the peninsula. I don't think there is a consensus in Crimea about separating from Ukraine.\"</p> <p>Clearly, this threat preoccupies Ukraine's pro-western elite. Yushchenko denounced Russia's recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as \"unacceptable\". Moscow's actions would hasten Ukraine's attempts to join Nato and the EU, and force it to increase its defences, he said.</p> <p>\"What has happened is a threat to everyone, not just for one country. Any nation could be next, any country. When we allowed someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity, we put into doubt the existence of any country,\" he told Reuters.</p> <p>Ukraine's pro-Russian former prime minister Viktor Yanukovich welcomed the Kremlin's decision. And Ukraine's prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, has been cautious not to criticise Moscow.</p> <p>Behind these statements are hard calculations ahead of Ukraine's presidential election in 2010. Yanukovich and Tymoshenko are likely to seek some accommodation with Moscow, should they win. </p> <p>Some observers believe there are solid reasons why Russia is unlikely to initiate another military adventure in Ukraine. Russia's elite have significant financial interests in Ukraine. \"It seems Medvedev is satisfied with the outcome of the Georgian conflict. I don't think they need a new conflict,\" Shevliakov said.</p>",
  "<p>While Democrats strain every sinew to show unity, anchormen covering the convention for MSNBC have descended into warfare with each other, live on air, which is much more entertaining. While right-leaning presenter Joe Scarborough was opining from the convention yesterday, his liberal colleague Keith Olbermann could be heard muttering \"Jesus, Joe, why don't you get a shovel?\" into an open microphone. </p> <p>When correspondent David Shuster, in conversation with Scarborough, pointed out the obvious - that Scarborough's a Republican - the host went ballistic, demanding to know which party Shuster belonged to. \"I'm a complete independent,\" Shuster replied. </p> <p>\"Oh, I feel so comforted by the fact that you're independent,\" Scarborough sneered. \"I bet everyone at MSNBC has 'independent' on their voting cards.\" </p> <p>Come along, kids. If Democrats who disagree with each other can achieve detente, surely three opinionated blowhards hired to stir controversy on screen should be able to reach some kind of ... Oh, no, fair point.</p> <p>\u00b7 Denver's full of stars - Tony Bennett is here, and Sean Penn, and Charlize Theron and Jessica Alba. But the Obama campaign doesn't want anything to do with them: footage of them anywhere near the candidate or his wife would play into the McCain team's hands. Not that the McCain team needs encouragement: they're handing out bumper stickers reading \"Obama for Rock Star, McCain for President,\" which by their recent standards is almost funny. </p> <p>\u00b7 Anti-abortion protesters have erected what they claim is the largest protest sign in history, on a hillside clearly visible from many hotels where Democratic delegates are staying. It's 530ft tall and - significantly? - 666ft wide and reads: \"Destroys Unborn Children\", because the Denver convention is being organised by the \"Democratic national committee\", which has the same three initial letters! Apart from the fact that it doesn't. So the word \"unborn\" has been written as \"uNborn\". </p> <p>\u00b7 Journalists and commentators can continue to pick over Hillary Clinton's Tuesday-night performance, but the final judgment is in. \"Body-language experts\" hired by CBS News have established that her heart wasn't in it. We can tell she wasn't enthusiastic about endorsing Obama because she didn't engage in \"self-touching\" while speaking about him, explains Joe </p> <p>Navarro, author of the book What Every BODY is Saying: An Ex-FBI Agent's Guide To Speed-Reading People. </p> <p>On healthcare, on McCain, and on Bill Clinton's legacy, \"there was a lot of self-touching\", he explains, which shows that Clinton felt strongly. Navarro appears to have a broad definition of body language: He praises Michelle Obama for having \"those beautiful high cheekbones that we see in models\".</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>We are holding out for a hero, and could it be David Lyscom, who will take the helm at the Independent Schools Council. He replaces Chris Parry, the former rear admiral whose time at the ISC ended shortly after his comments, first reported in this paper, branding many state school pupils as unteachable and their parents as ignorant. No surprise that the new man selected to lead the ISC is a former diplomat; with a civil tongue, he might last that bit longer. Nevertheless, we have a bit of history with this Mr Lyscom, for last year we reported on allegations that British officials were privately bad-mouthing Angel Gurria, secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. At the time, the OECD's anti-corruption watchdog was criticising the government over the BAE Systems scandal. The main attack was an article in the Economist accusing Gurria of enjoying freebies and handing out jobs to his family. Lyscom, then Britain's ambassador to the OECD, denied any funny stuff. \"The UK had nothing to do with planting the story,\" he told us then, but he did admit having spoken off the record to the Economist before it launched its salvo. We never quite got to the bottom of it all, but we do hope any observations he may make about our state schools will be clear and on the record. Avoids confusion.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Seems we are not the only ones who would rather die than let the BAE thing be damped down. John Spellar MP is just as bad. \"The Lib Dems in Westminster were quick to criticise the serious fraud office for dropping its inquiry into BAE and its alleged dealings with Saudi Arabia,\" rails the former minister in his pamphlet on political affairs, thoughtfully headlined Liberal Demolition. \"Do their Lib Dem colleagues in towns where BAE Systems is an important local employer agree with them?\" One would hope they might, on the basis of principle, if nothing else, but then we accept that moral positioning is pretty much out of date these days. Like vinyl and all those cassettes.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Marvellous, then, that some well-known figures remain true to themselves and true to best principles and there was an outstanding example of this in the Sun yesterday. \"People simply won't stand for letting the unions hold us to ransom any more,\" said a strangely combative voice. \"Limiting the power of the unions was a painful process but a necessary one which we have now completed.\" And it was good to have those words of wisdom from Tony Blackburn. But how would Jimmy Savile fight terrorism?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>We have been running the rule over Joe Biden, now he is Obama's running mate, and we find that though he may not have the wherewithal to write his own speeches, he is a hotshot on the nuclear threat. This may, in time, have implications for the Iranians. A report released last year by Greens in the European parliament details how Biden, during a stint as chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, highlighted the dangers of proliferation by asking ordinary scientists to go away and, without breaking any laws, construct him an atomic weapon. It took them a few months. He was staggered. When he sought to break the news to his colleagues, few seemed interested, so he \"literally asked the laboratories to physically take this device into the Senate. It was bigger than a breadbox and smaller than a dump truck, but they were able to get it in.\" And we are worrying about \"meth heads\" with rifles who threatened to shoot Obama. Come on. Get real. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>What Biden brings to the Obama camp is his ability to reach out to people. And he knows the power brokers. That is why one of his first acts as potential vice-president was to send a personalised email to the surrealist Rainbow George. \"Rainbow, I'd like to thank you for the warm welcome I have received as the newest member of this campaign,\" he told him. \"What you and Barack have accomplished over the past 19 months is incredible.\" He asks that Rainbow should stay involved in the campaign, which is significant because usually people ask him to stay away. Shows that this election is all about change. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama used the huge exposure of his historic Democratic convention speech in Denver tonight to try to persuade voters that he can lead America and help turn around the ailing economy.</p> <p>The 47-year-old senator from Illinois was yesterday formally nominated by thousands of cheering delegates to be the Democratic presidential candidate, becoming the first African-American to lead a major political party into election.</p> <p>In a symbolic gesture, his rival Hillary Clinton called a halt to the formal roll call of votes and urged delegates to close ranks behind Obama and nominate him by acclamation.</p> <p>His acceptance speech tonight coincided with the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's \"I have a dream\" speech. But in spite of the emotion attached to the address, Obama largely dispensed with the high-blown rhetoric that has been the trademark of his 19-month campaign, and instead concentrated on how to soften the impact of job losses, high petrol prices and repossessed homes, and address the huge US poverty gap.</p> <p>The economy has become the single issue that could determine the next occupation of the White House. Obama is to fly from Denver on Friday to take that message on a bus tour of rustbelt states, where he is hoping to win over lower income voters with a programme of tax cuts.</p> <p>Tonight's speech will be his best chance to make his case to Democrats and Americans watching on television that he represents change in contrast to John McCain.</p> <p>In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published yesterday, Obama said: \"The single most important thing I have to make clear is the choice we have in November between the same failed policy of the last eight years for the middle class and the new agenda to boost income for Americans and help families who are struggling. I will make that contrast very clearly.\"</p> <p>He desperately needs a bounce in the polls after seeing his lead over McCain evaporate over the past month. Michelle Obama's speech on Monday, with its focus on family, helped recapture a little ground, but Obama needs to consolidate that. Obama, who is to deliver the speech at the Denver Broncos' ground, wrote most of it in longhand before reworking it on computer, staff said.</p> <p>After the speech the spotlight will shift to the Republicans. There is intense speculation that McCain will announce his running mate tomorrow, which will keep his party in the headlines over a holiday weekend and into next week, when the Republicans hold their convention.</p> <p>\"In terms of his speech, Obama has got to do two things, he has to rally his base, and he has to reach out to independent voters,\" said Michael Dimock, the associate director of the Pew Research Centre.</p> <p>The difficulty for Obama is that while he is far more trusted on the economy than McCain, the Republican is seen as the stronger leader, one more capable of dealing with foreign policy.</p> <p>Dimock said Obama wanted \"to get people focused on the economy because that is the area of his strength, but he also has to reassure people in the areas where they are not as confident of him\".</p> <p>The speech will provide an opportunity to salvage a convention dominated for almost three out of four days by Hillary and Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton does not plan to stay for Obama's speech.</p> <p>The friction between the two camps has accentuated the nervousness of some Democrats about the tightening race between Obama and McCain. \"This Democratic convention has a vibe so weird and jittery, so at odds with the early thrilling, fairydust feel of the Obama revolution,\" the New York Times commentator Maureen Dowd wrote yesterday.</p> <p>The Republicans have been quick to exploit the tensions. Yesterday, Rudy Giuliani, the former Republican mayor of New York who has led a spoiler operation at the convention, accused Obama of mismanaging his convention.</p> <p>\"I couldn't understand why he would organise a convention to give the Clintons two nights and then diss Hillary as vice-president,\" Giuliani told reporters.</p> <p>Tonight, though, is Obama's chance to get the party back on course, and provide an answer to Democratic critics who say the convention has been lacking in substance and clear message.</p> <p>He will outline tax plans to provide relief for those hardest hit by the economic downturn and to address inequality. He plans to change the tax code so that families making more than $250,000 (\u00a3136,000) would pay more while everyone else pays less. This would be accompanied by moves to create jobs and tackle global warming through investment in alternative energy and rebuilding the US's long-ignored physical infrastructure.</p>",
  "<p>James Carville, the man who ran Bill Clinton's legendary 1992 presidential campaign, caused a stir in Denver after the first night of the Democratic convention when he said his party had now had five evenings in the Bush era, counting the four nights of the 2004 convention, in which to hold the Republican administration to account - and it had blown all five of them. </p> <p>He was a happier man after day two, praising his colleagues for at last throwing some punches at the Republicans and at John McCain.</p> <p>He and others had delighted as, for example, the Democratic governor of Montana, Brian Schweitzer - a new face on the national scene - urged delegates to \"get off your hind end\" and demonstrate their determination to see the back of the Republicans.</p> <p>Standing up, they thundered a loud and repeated \"No!\" as Schweitzer asked them \"Can we afford four more years of the same?\" </p> <p>That is the central theme of the Democratic attack on McCain: that he is offering nothing more than an extension of the Bush presidency, that he will be John McSame. </p> <p>One of the night's more memorable lines came from Hillary Clinton: \"It makes sense that George Bush and John McCain will be together next week in the Twin Cities [Minneapolis-St Paul], because these days they're awfully hard to tell apart.\"</p> <p>That pleased those, such as Carville, who have been itching for the Democrats to start baring their teeth, haunted as they are by the memory of 2004 when John Kerry held back from attacking the Republicans - for which he paid a heavy price. </p> <p>The trouble is all that aggressive work was overshadowed by the drama which has dominated at Denver: the reconciliation of Hillary Clinton and her supporters to the candidacy of Barack Obama. </p> <p>Day two had two objectives: first, to begin the attack on McCain and second, to unite the Democratic party, including devoted Hillaryites, behind the nominee. </p> <p>The instant consensus was that Clinton had done precisely that, in a powerful speech that urged even the most diehard Pumas - Party Unity, My Ass - to fall in line.</p> <p>She introduced herself as a \"proud supporter\" of Obama and, in a crucial passage, asked her backers \"Were you in this campaign just for me?\" - or to pursue a cause that could only be served by victory over McCain. </p> <p>Still, in the cold light of the next day, it was hard not to feel there was something pro forma about Clinton's presentation. She had not done much more than tell Democrats they were obliged to back their leader, rather than making a case for Obama in his own right.</p> <p>That gave the Republicans an immediate opening, as they noted that she had not declared Obama ready to be president or qualified to serve as commander-in-chief. </p> <p>That's especially pertinent now because McCain is on the air with TV advertisements featuring footage of Hillary Clinton declaring that she and McCain have a lifetime of experience - while Obama has a speech. She needed to disavow that statement on Tuesday and she did not. </p> <p>In some ways, these details are less important than the simple fact that, midway through a convention that was meant to launch Obama into the general election, the Democrats were still looking inward and still, yet again, talking about the Clintons. </p> <p>That problem was exacerbated once more last night as Bill Clinton was due to speak, with reporters poised to search for any coded dissent from him.</p> <p>It meant that for two of the four nights of the Obama convention, the spotlight was on the Clintons - and the media chatter focused on the storyline of Democratic disunity. </p> <p>Of course, it was inevitable that, after such a tightly fought primary contest, a segment of the convention would have to be given over to Hillary Clinton. But some Democrats fear that Obama, in his acceptance speech tonight, will have to do in a single evening what should have been done in four - that his convention has been so consumed with healing, it's spent too little time trying to win.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama will have to draw on all his considerable oratorical skills tonight to connect himself to those parts of the electorate that remain unconvinced by his message and unclear about what he represents.</p> <p>\"He will be addressing the single largest audience he will have at any time between now and the election, so it's important to use the event to make clear where he stands on matters that are worrying voters,\" said Ted Sorensen, John F Kennedy's chief speechwriter.</p> <p>\"Obama is the first presidential candidate who reminds me of Kennedy's eloquence and capacity to inspire. They both, despite their own special backgrounds, convey to people that they understand and listen to every American citizen.\"</p> <p>To a large degree, the success of Obama's presidential run so far has been built on his skills as a speechmaker. It was his speech to the Democratic convention four years ago, before he had even entered the Senate, that propelled him into the national spotlight.</p> <p>\"He is blessed with a richly resonant voice that we love to hear; he could read the telephone directory and it would sound good,\" said Ted Widmer, editor of an acclaimed edition of American political speeches and a former Bill Clinton speechwriter. \"He is very good at pauses and inflection, and he cuts an impressive figure on stage - all of which adds up to making an Obama speech a special event.\"</p> <p>The Kennedy link is evident within Obama's own team of speechwriters. Adam Frankel, a graduate of the London School of Economics, spent six years working with Sorensen on his memoirs - immersing himself in the process in Kennedy's oratory. Frankel is 26, as is Obama's chief speechwriter, Jon Favreau, or Favs as he is known, who used to work for John Kerry.</p> <p>A third important scribe recently joined the Obama campaign. Sarah Hurwitz was Hillary Clinton's main speechwriter during the primary season, a role she previously performed for General Wesley Clark in his 2004 bid. </p> <p>Obama is clearly surrounded by youthful talent, though what is less clear is how much he depends on it. He has told reporters that he personally began writing tonight's address while on holiday this month in Hawaii.</p> <p>But demonstrating his now well-proven ability to inspire a crowd will be only part of the challenge for Obama tonight. Crucially, he must also tiptoe his way through the sensitive issue of race. The question of how much reference he makes to his potential to make history as America's first black president is all the more loaded because today is the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's famous \"I have a dream\" speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial.</p> <p>\"It's a complicated calculation,\" said Randall Kennedy, a professor at Harvard law school. \"On the one hand, he can't go wrong in invoking such an iconic speech that has become part of Americana. On the other hand, the more Obama talks about race the blacker he becomes - and America still has a massive race problem.\"</p>",

It was as stirring a speech as possible.</p> <p>While she was unequivocal in her support, and insistent that John McCain not be given the presidency, she did not do anything to disagree with her negative pronouncements about Obama during the primary.</p> <p>That notwithstanding, Hillary's non-keynote keynote, if it was an act, was a damn good act.</p> <p>Her <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/26/AR2008082603921.html\">Puma supporters do not appear assuaged</a> at the moment. What's Puma? It is a slightly derisive depiction of the most diehard Hillary supporters, \"party unity my ass\". I think this goes a lot deeper than many realise and has complex reasons that go back to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/hillaryclinton.uselections2008\">divide between early suffragettes and abolitionists</a>. Most things have their historical roots. And progressives, radicals and reformers do have a tendency to eat their young.</p> <p>Still, I think, as <a href=\"http://www.whistlingpastdixie.com/\">Tom Schaller</a>, the Salon columnist and UMBC political science professor, told me in an interview this morning, that most of them will come back into the fold come election day. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/27/uselections2008.usa?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=worldnews\">Bill Clinton's decision not to be in Denver on Thursday night</a> when Obama accepts the nomination at Ivesco Field seems to, once again, prove this is about the Clintons and nothing but the Clintons.</p> <p>The reality is that there was no conspiracy. Nancy Pelosi and Howard Dean did not conspire to give the election to Obama. The Clintons (yes, plural) lost this election on their own. They had more money and were 30 points up in the polls. They squandered their money on old-fashioned techniques, like direct-mail fundraising.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton's organisation was dysfunctional from the top down. Hillary and Bill ranted and raved at staff, and their campaign went into panic mode after the initial Obama surge. They were not prepared and did not know what hit them. They lost control of the party to a new vision and a broadening base. They won't give up easily.</p> <p>Ah, Democrats - for the sake of our right to choose, ending this war in Iraq, getting healthcare to our citizens and leaving room for populists and progressives to join the debate, I hope you can get your act together by November 4.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama does not appear at the Democratic convention until tomorrow, but his face is already everywhere in this city: on T-shirts, buttons, mouse pads, stickers, temporary tattoos, tote bags, and even a hot-selling pair of women's underwear.</p> <p>The streets of Denver have become an open-air market of Obama-bilia, with vendors competing for the title of cleverest souvenir.</p> <p>One local bookstore is selling yoga gear printed with Om-Bama, the slogan of meditating Democrats. Another entrepreneur took the candidate's pioneering status literally with a button that simply read \"I Heart Black People\".</p> <p>\"It really is about people getting involved,\" local merchant Cathy Grenier said. Along with her sister and friend, Grenier was manning a pushcart today under the small-business banner of On Our Way Products.</p> <p>On Our Way offered a copious lineup of gifts to curious delegates and activists. The pushcart featured bottled water with Obama's photo and a baseball cap showing a Democratic donkey, a Republican elephant, and a giant question mark.</p> <p>What's the message? The cap is for undecided voters, Grenier explained.</p> <p>A nearby pushcart was clearly aiming for the hipster demographic, offering tight women's tank tops and underwear with Obama's signature rising-sun logo.</p> <p>The most popular item by far is buttons with cheeky slogans, a longtime staple of political conventions that are again ubiquitous this year.</p> <p>Some buttons blast George Bush as never having met \"a corporation he didn't like\". Others superimpose Obama's face over James Bond star Daniel Craig's, adding the tagline \"Convention Royale\".</p> <p>One popular button seemed to suggest dumping Joseph Biden from the Democratic ticket in favour of 16-year-old pop star Miley Cyrus, showing her photo alongside Obama's with the slogan \"The Teen's Choice\".</p> <p>At official Obama campaign merchandise tents, T-shirts are sold with a Hope logo that is modelled on the famous 1960s Love poster. The Hope image has been transformed into a sculpture that sits just outside the Pepsi centre, where the convention is taking place.</p> <p>Despite the array of tempting trinkets for sale, however, many visitors at the merchandise tent today were giving rather than buying. Volunteers were kept busy passing out contribution sheets for those who wanted to give money to the campaign.</p> <p>\"We're maxed out?\" one dejected delegate said after hearing that she could not legally give another dime to the candidate.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama will have to draw on all his considerable oratorical skills tomorrow night to connect himself to those parts of the electorate that remain unconvinced by his message and unclear about what he represents.</p> <p>\"He will be addressing the single largest audience he will have at any time between now and the election, so it's important to use the event to make clear where he stands on matters that are worrying voters,\" said Ted Sorensen, John F Kennedy's chief speechwriter.</p> <p>\"Obama is the first presidential candidate who reminds me of Kennedy's eloquence and capacity to inspire. They both, despite their own special backgrounds, convey to people that they understand and listen to every American citizen.\"</p> <p>To a large degree, the success of Obama's presidential run so far has been built on his skills as a speechmaker. It was his speech to the Democratic convention four years ago, before he had even entered the US Senate, that propelled him into the national spotlight.</p> <p>\"He is blessed with a richly resonant voice that we love to hear; he could read the telephone directory and it would sound good,\" said Ted Widmer, editor of an acclaimed edition of American political speeches and a former Bill Clinton speechwriter. </p> <p>\"He is very good at pauses and inflection, and he cuts an impressive figure on stage - all of which adds up to making an Obama speech a special event.\"</p> <p>The Kennedy link is evident within Obama's own team of speechwriters. Adam Frankel, a graduate of the London School of Economics, spent six years working with Sorensen on his memoirs - immersing himself in the process in Kennedy's oratory. Frankel is 26, as is Obama's chief speechwriter, Jon Favreau, or Favs as he is known, who used to work for John Kerry.</p> <p>A third important scribe recently joined the Obama campaign. Sarah Hurwitz was Hillary Clinton's main speechwriter during the primary season, a role she previously performed for General Wesley Clark in his 2004 bid.</p> <p>Obama is clearly surrounded by youthful talent, though what is less clear is how much he depends on it. He has told reporters that he personally began writing tonight's address while on holiday this month in Hawaii.</p> <p>But demonstrating his now well-proven ability to inspire a crowd will be only part of the challenge for Obama tomorrow night. </p> <p>Crucially, he must also tiptoe his way through the sensitive issue of race. The question of how much reference he makes to his potential to make history as America's first black president is all the more loaded because tomorrow is the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's famous \"I have a dream speech\" in front of the Lincoln Memorial.</p> <p>\"It's a complicated calculation,\" said Randall Kennedy, a professor at Harvard law school. </p> <p>\"On the one hand, he can't go wrong in invoking such an iconic speech that has become part of Americana. On the other hand, the more Obama talks about race the blacker he becomes - and America still has a massive race problem.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan\">Pakistan</a>'s nascent democratic movement has been subverted by selfishness and naked powerplays. Waiting for an authentic democracy to \"evolve\" remains the ultimate goal, but given the way the Taliban are systematically dismantling the country one has to wonder what is in store for this most troubled nation.</p> <p>The Taliban are so emboldened that they recently attacked the army's largest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/22/pakistan.terrorism\">munitions plant</a> and killed 73 people. Two days earlier a suicide bomber <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/19/pakistan.terrorism\">struck a hospital</a> and killed 29 people. Most of the victims were from the family of a man whom the Taliban had murdered earlier in the day. The second biggest city in the country, Lahore, has been hit by suicide bombings in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/10/pakistan.allegrastratton\">January (22 killed)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/12/pakistan\">March (31 killed)</a>, and August (nine killed). Recently, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/breakingnews/International/0,,7718126,00.html\">bus bombing in Peshawar</a> killed 11. Another 10 were killed when the entire family of an Awami National Party MP \u2013 wife, children, grandparents and uncles \u2013 were <a href=\"http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=237887&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=41&amp;parent_id=23\">massacred</a> by way of rockets and grenades, leaving nothing but a smouldering house. An American public television station <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/pakistan703/\">sent a reporter</a> to Taliban controlled areas and he returned with images of the bodies of old tribal leaders purposefully left in the streets to rot (against the custom of giving a proper burial to every human being). There are no legal or religious limits to Taliban terror. Last year in December they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/21/pakistan\">blew up</a> more than 50 worshippers who had gathered to celebrate the Hajj at a mosque.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/10/alqaida.terrorism\">Ayman al-Zawahiri</a>, the nihilist mentor of the Taliban, is egging on this murder. He came on a private television station and gave a lecture to the Pakistani people about the supposed righteousness of his monstrosities. The talk was in English because the self-styled liberator of Pakistan doesn't speak the language of the people he aims to rule.</p> <p>Over the past decade General Musharraf was supposed to check this butchery. To that end he received $10bn in US military funding; $6bn of which was unconditional. He did nothing. In 2001, he left open passageways into the NWFP for al-Qaida members escaping the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan. He was responsible for allowing infamous terror outfits like Sipah-e-Sahaba to reorganise and even hold public rallies (as long as they <a href=\"http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/grare_pakistan_final.pdf\">changed their name [pdf: see page 14]</a>). He <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0906/dailyUpdate.html\">signed a truce</a> with the Taliban and al-Qaida in Waziristan; one so in favour of the Taliban that they had their weapons and prisoners restored. He was also responsible for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/11/pakistan.declanwalsh\">Red Mosque massacre</a> when he turned a blind eye to an extremist imam a few blocks from his own residence, all so that when he did finally use (excessive) force against the demagogue, it would distract people away from his sacking the chief justice of Pakistan. The act of killing <a href=\"http://www.chowrangi.com/nawab-akbar-bugti-killed.html\">Akbar Bugti</a>, a secular nationalist rebel in Balochistan who used to keep out the Taliban, allowed the Taliban to turn Quetta, Balochistan's capital, into their stronghold. Quetta, on the border with Iran, is where Mullah Muhammad Omar (<a href=\"http://www.afghan-web.com/bios/today/momar.html\">remember him?</a>) now lives. Meanwhile Musharraf, who was first forced to retire from the military, and then to resign from his position as president, is planning on collecting big time money on the lecture circuit. Assuredly he will make no mention of the thousands of graves his reckless neglect has created.</p> <p>The arrival of genuine democracy has not spared Pakistan a bit from terrorism. In fact, the militants have stepped up their attacks on the popularly elected government. This shows \u2013 emphatically \u2013 that the Taliban are not, and have never been, resistance fighters standing up to a dictatorship as has been their spin for the past eight years. They are cold-blooded serial killers. They will destroy any state they do not control. These days they are after Pakistan.</p> <p>The Pakistani leadership is not helping matters. The coalition government between Asif Zardari's PPP and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif's PML-N <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/26/pakistan\">has broken up</a>. </p> <p>The twin issues over which they have separated are (i) Zardari's unwillingness to restore all of the judges, including Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhary, that Musharraf deposed last year; and (ii) Zardari seeking the now vacant position of president for himself, before the Pakistani legislature has had a chance to repeal the hubristic legal powers that various dictators, including Musharraf, sneakily allotted to the post. One of these excessive presidential powers is the ability to dismantle the government under article 58(2)(b); another is the entire 17th amendment which makes the president the head of state (as opposed to the prime minister as contemplated in the original 1973 constitution).</p> <p>Zardari has his reasons for waffling on the issue of judges. Bringing back Chief Justice Chaudhary could mean that certain corruption charges against him might be revived. Not only that, but a reinstated chief justice could also do something far more detrimental to the PPP. </p> <p>In the fall of 2007 a suit was filed challenging whether Musharraf had ever possessed the authority to call for the February elections. If Musharraf didn't have the authority \u2013 and Chaudhary would likely rule that way \u2013 that could mean that the PPP's win in February could be wiped away and fresh elections could be called. Although this is not likely, Zardari isn't taking chances. </p> <p>Zardari doesn't want new elections for the simple fact that Sharif's party actually did surprisingly well in February, and in a new election, would probably do even better by bringing in the fundamentalists from Jamat-e-Islami who sat out. Thus, even though Zardari previously put his hand over the Qur'an and said he'd restore all the judges within 24 hours of forming the government, he has resisted reinstating all the judges (he's willing to reinstate some). </p> <p>In principle, Sharif is not opposed to Zardari taking on the position of president, however, he (rightly) wants the excessive presidential powers curtailed. Sharif is taking that stance for one simple reason: in his first term he was thrown out of office by a President invoking 58(2)(b). He wants to get elected prime minister for a third time and be able to stay there. Pakistan's original 1973 constitution, written by Zardari's father in law, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, envisions a powerful prime minister. Ironically, it is Sharif, who in the 1980s collaborated with Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's murderer, General Zia ul Haq, who is now upholding that vision.</p> <p>Sharif is also in favor of restoring all the judges. That too is a bit ironic since in the 1990's his party members actually physically assaulted supreme court judges and he was connected to a scheme to depose his own Chief Justice, Sajjad Ali Shah. Having said that, right now Sharif is doing the right thing, especially as a great majority of Pakistanis want the judges restored in full. This populist position is helping Sharif and making Zardari look bad which causes the PPP man to further drag his feet.</p> <p>Each day brings a new twist in this political soap opera. Perhaps if these two leaders took the time out to count the number of Pakistanis blown to pieces in recent days by the Taliban they would be able to put aside their incestuous power-games and take some action for the safety of a broken and beaten republic.</p> <p>The history of Pakistan's dynastic civilian rulers, however, suggests such self-reflection is unlikely.</p>",
  "<p>James Carville, the man who ran Bill Clinton's legendary 1992 presidential campaign, caused quite a stir in Denver after the first night of the Democratic convention when he said that his party had now had five evenings in the Bush era, counting the four nights of the 2004 convention, in which to hold the Republican administration to account - and it had blown all five of them.</p> <p>He was a happier man after day two, praising his colleagues for at last throwing some punches at the Republicans and at John McCain. </p> <p>He and others had delighted as, for example, the Democratic governor of Montana, Brian Schweitzer - a new face on the national scene - urged delegates to \"get off your hind end\" and demonstrate their determination to see the back of the Republicans. Standing up, they thundered a loud and repeated \"No!\" as Schweitzer asked them \"Can we afford four more years of the same?\"</p> <p>That is the central theme of the Democratic attack on McCain: that he is offering nothing more than an extension of the Bush presidency, that he will be John McSame. </p> <p>One of the night's more memorable lines came from Hillary Clinton: \"It makes sense that George Bush and John McCain will be together next week in the Twin Cities, because these days they're awfully hard to tell apart.\"</p> <p>That pleased those, like Carville, who have been itching for the Democrats to start baring their teeth, haunted as they are by the memory of 2004 when John Kerry held back from attacking the Republicans - for which he paid a heavy price.</p> <p>The trouble is, all that aggressive work was overshadowed by the drama that has dominated at Denver: the reconciliation of Hillary Clinton and her supporters to the candidacy of Barack Obama.</p> <p>For Day Two had two objectives: first, to begin the attack on McCain and second, to unite the Democratic party, including devoted Hillaryites, behind the nominee.</p> <p>The instant consensus was that Clinton had done precisely that, in a powerful speech that urged even the most diehard Pumas - Party Unity, My Ass - to fall in line. She introduced herself as a \"proud supporter\" of Obama and, in a crucial passage, asked her backers \"Were you in this campaign just for me?\" - or to pursue a cause that could only be served by victory over McCain.</p> <p>Still, in the cold light of the next day, it was hard not to feel there was something pro-forma about Hillary's presentation. She had not done much more than tell Democrats they were obliged to back their leader, rather than making a case for Obama in his own right. </p> <p>That gave the Republicans an immediate opening, as they noted that she had not declared Obama ready to be president or qualified to serve as commander-in-chief.</p> <p>That's especially pertinent now because McCain is on the air with TV advertisements featuring footage of Hillary Clinton during the primary campaign declaring that she and McCain have a lifetime of experience - while Obama has a speech. She needed to disavow that statement yesterday and she did not.</p> <p>In some ways, these details are less important than the simple fact that, midway through a convention that was meant to launch Obama into the general election, the Democrats were still looking inward, seeking to unify themselves - and still, yet again, talking about the Clintons.</p> <p>That problem has been exacerbated once more as Bill Clinton is due to speak tonight, with reporters poised to search for any coded sign of dissension between him and the nominee. It meant that for two of the four nights of the Obama convention, the spotlight was on the Clintons - and the media chatter focused, as it had been since Sunday, on the storyline of Democratic disunity.</p> <p>Of course, it was inevitable that, after such a tightly fought primary contest, a segment of the convention would have to be given over to Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>But some Democrats now fear that Barack Obama in his acceptance speech tomorrow night will have to do in a single evening what should have been done in four - that his convention has been so consumed with trying to heal, it's spent too little time trying to win.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama is to use the huge exposure of his historic Democratic convention speech in Denver tomorrow night to try to persuade voters that that he can lead America and help turn around the ailing economy.</p> <p>On the eve of his speech in a 75,000-seat football stadium, Obama said that he would dispense with the high-blown rhetoric that has been the trademark of his 19-month campaign, and concentrate on how to soften the impact of job losses, high petrol prices and repossessed homes and address the huge poverty gap that exists in the US.</p> <p>America's mortgage crisis and rising petrol prices have made the economy the single issue that could determine the next occupation of the White House.</p> <p>Obama is to fly from Denver on Friday to take that message on a bus tour of rustbelt states where he is hoping to win over lower-income voters with a programme of tax cuts.</p> <p>His address tomorrow night, on the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's I Have a Dream speech, will be a landmark: the first African American to receive the presidential nomination of a major political party.</p> <p>But more crucially for Obama, tomorrow night's speech will the most high visibility occasion of his campaign and his best chance to make his case to Democrats and Americans watching on television that he represents change - the key theme of the election campaign - in contrast to his rival, John McCain.</p> <p>In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published today, Obama said of the speech: \"The single most important thing I have to make clear is the choice we have in November between the same failed policy of the last eight years for the middle class and the new agenda to boost income for Americans and help families who are struggling. I will make that contrast very clearly.\"</p> <p>The senator, who was scheduled to arrive in Denver today after winding up a tour of the battlefield states in Missouri and Montana, desperately needs a bounce in the polls from the convention speech after seeing his lead over McCain evaporate over the last month.</p> <p>Obama, who is to deliver the speech at the Denver Broncos' ground from a specially-built platform with Greek columns, wrote most of the speech in long-hand before reworking it on computer, according to his staff.</p> <p>On the morning after the speech, the spotlight shifts to the Republicans. There is intense speculation that McCain will announce his choice of running mate on Friday, which will keep his party in the headlines over a holiday weekend and into next week when the Republicans hold their convention.</p> <p>\"In terms of his speech, Obama has got to do two things, he has to rally his base, and he has to reach out to independent voters,\" said Michael Dimock, the associate director of the Pew Research Centre.</p> <p>The difficulty for Obama is that while he is far more trusted on the economy than McCain, the Republican is seen as the stronger leader, one more capable of handling a crisis and dealing with foreign policy.</p> <p>Dimock said that Obama wants \"to get people focused on the economy because that is the area of his strength, but he also has to reassure people in the areas where they are not as confident of him\".</p> <p>The speech will provide an opportunity to salvage a convention dominated for almost three out of four days by Hillary and Bill Clinton to the frustration of the Obama campaign team.</p> <p>Bill Clinton does not plan to stick around the convention long enough to hear his speech.</p> <p>The friction between the two camps has accentuated the nervousness of some Democrats about the tightening race between Obama and McCain. \"This Democratic convention has a vibe so weird and jittery, so at odds with the early thrilling, fairy dust feel of the Obama revolution,\" the New York Times commentator, Maureen Dowd, wrote today.</p> <p>The Republicans have been quick to exploit those tensions between the old and new guards of the Democratic party, and stoke doubts about Obama's leadership. </p> <p>Today, Rudy Giuliani, the former Republican mayor of New York City who has led a spoiler operation at the convention, accused Obama of mismanaging his convention.</p> <p>\"I couldn't understand why he would organise a convention to give the Clintons two nights and then diss Hillary as vice-president,\" Giuliani told reporters.</p> <p>Tomorrow night though is Obama's chance to get the party back on course, and provide an answer to Democratic critics who say the convention has been lacking in substance and clear message.</p> <p>He is to outline tax plans to provide relief for those hardest hit by the economic downturn and to address inequality.</p> <p>He is planning to change the tax code so that families making more than $250,000 (\u00a3136,000) will pay more while everyone else pays less. This would be accompanied by moves to create jobs and tackle global warming through investment in alternative energy and the rebuilding of the US's long-ignored physical infrastructure.</p>",
  "<p>US secretary of state <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0826/p06s05-wome.html\">Condoleezza Rice just completed her seventh visit to Israel-Palestine</a> since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/theannapolisconference\">Annapolis conference</a> nine months ago. You remember Annapolis, when after almost seven years of neglect the Bush administration committed itself to securing an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal during its last year in office and to dramatically improving the day-to-day situation on the ground.</p> <p>Displaying admirable consistency and tenacity, albeit a disconnect from reality, Rice reiterated that goal during her visit this week. The Israeli and Palestinian leaders she met with were polite in their encouragement. Yet even among those who desire a deal, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/26/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast\">most consider the clock to have run out</a> on this administration. Israeli foreign minister and chief negotiator (and contender to be the next prime minister) Tzipi Livni actually warned against pushing too far too fast in advance of Rice's arrival. There is also an increasing sense within the US government that Rice is somewhat out on her own and on a limb in believing the process can be significantly advanced in the dusk of her time at Foggy Bottom. </p> <p>In relaunching the peace process last November, the US sought to address three issues. First, get a deal on the parameters of a permanent status peace. Second, significantly upgrade the situation on the ground \u2013 enhance security, ease closures and stop settlements. And third, improve the regional climate for peacemaking. In pursuing all three in parallel, they got the \"what\" right. It is the \"how\" that went horribly wrong.</p> <p>Next month will mark 15 years of the peace process. At this stage we need more peace and less process. Clearly, defining the endgame parameters, achieving closure, is a necessity. Getting Israelis and Palestinians negotiating again is certainly an achievement. The problem is that after nine months, the negotiations today are barely back to where they left off in January 2001. America probably needed to asses the party's positions from the get go and then either advance closure, accept that the gaps were too significant or submit it's own bridging ideas. None of these were done. In the meantime, both the Israeli and Palestinian leaders, Ehud Olmert and Mahmoud Abbas, lack domestic political legitimacy, and even the optimists talk of a shelf agreement rather than a plan for implementation.</p> <p>In emphasising the open-ended negotiations, the Annapolis process relegated developments on the ground to being an issue of secondary political magnitude. While the US did enhance its efforts and monitoring on the day-to-day issues, it did so without either a willingness to expend political capital to push for compliance or a readiness to recognise and adapt to certain new realities (in particular Hamas's election victory and subsequent political pre-eminence on the Palestinian side).</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the result was too much of the same ongoing deterioration. Settlements continue to expand (see the latest Peace Now report showing that settlement expansion almost doubled this year), obstacles to Palestinian movement have increased not decreased and any gains registered on the security front are at best marginal. Yes, <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080825/ap_on_re_mi_ea/israel_palestinians\">Israel did release 198 Palestinian prisoners</a> to President Abbas to coincide with Rice's arrival. However, such ephemeral gestures unrelated to a broader prisoner release or political plan do little to build Palestinian confidence and only leave Israelis more confused and anxious as to what this means in terms of their security and the bigger picture. </p> <p>Paradoxically, the most significant development on the ground was extraneous to the US-Israel-Fatah Annapolis track and occurred as part of the parallel Egypt-Israel-Hamas process, namely the <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/976382.html\">ceasefire</a> which has brought a significant degree of security quiet to Gaza and to Israel's southern communities.</p> <p>In trying to create a supportive regional climate, US efforts if anything achieved the opposite. Bringing the Arab states into the Annapolis process was the right thing to do and belatedly built on the potential of the Arab initiative first launched and ignored in 2002. But the US also framed Annapolis as the everyone-against-Iran-club, both magnifying Iran's sense of being a regional hegemon and incentivising it to play a spoiler role. Engaging in a parallel diplomatic effort with Iran (as was recently hinted at when undersecretary of state <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/18/iran.usforeignpolicy2\">William Burns joined the Geneva talks</a>) would have made far more sense.</p> <p>The Bush administration remained adamant in opposing a peace process with Syria even as <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/05/21/israel.syria/index.html\">Israel relaunched its own talks</a> via Turkish mediation. As Annapolis stuttered, the Arab states embraced by the US as moderate allies again seem to be embarrassed and on the weakened side. These factors together with the unwillingness to generate a more politically sophisticated and smartly calibrated approach to Hamas and now the increasing tensions with Russia have created a regional climate even less conducive to the current US approach.</p> <p>At the end of her seventh visit, Rice gets an 'A' for effort, but the results seem less generous in every other category. Rice could still produce a handover to the next administration, which could be, with some justification, portrayed as a significant improvement on the hand received in January 2001. She may even suggest American guidelines for a peace deal based on her own conclusions from the current talks. But to be useful, such a plan would have to get the content right (and previous Bush announcements are a cause of concern), be adopted by the new president-elect and be introduced at an appropriate moment in the Israeli and Palestinian political cycles (which may not exist between now and January).</p> <p>More likely, Rice will need to hand over a work that is not only in progress but also in need of major repair. A new administration of either political stripe will likely express commitment to continuing negotiations and pursuing peace, but they should be warned that if achieving a two-state solution is still the goal, then an 'A' for effort will not be enough this time. It is not an alarmist or exaggerated claim to suggest that on the watch of the next US president the two-state solution will either finally be realised or have definitively passed its sell-by date.</p>",
  "<p>So the suspense, as the ruling UMP party commented with some irony yesterday, is finally over: Bertrand Delano\u00eb, recently (and comfortably) <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10880982\">re-elected</a> mayor of Paris, will <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4614091.ece\">put himself forward</a> for election as first secretary of France's shattered Socialists at their next national congress in November.</p> <p>Alarmingly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/06/france.jasonburke\">Delano\u00eb</a> is likely to be one of up to eight candidates for the top job at a deeply divided party still struggling, more than a year after the fact, to recover from S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal's presidential election defeat to Nicolas Sarkozy. Despite Sarkozy's disastrous showing in the opinion polls, the Socialists are seemingly incapable of mounting any form of unified opposition.</p> <p>Might the Paris mayor be the man to rescue them, and \u2013 a long shot at present, but a distinct possibility if he emerges victorious at the Reims congress \u2013 to challenge the hyperactive but ever more unpopular president for the Elys\u00e9e in 2012 ?</p> <p>On the plus side, Delano\u00eb has been, and still is, a solid mayor. He's combined a few eye-catching and widely emulated ideas (the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3914649.stm\">Paris Plage</a> summer beach on the Seine; the <a href=\"http://www.paris.fr/portail/culture/portal.lut?page_id=6806\">Nuit Blanche</a> all-night culture fest; the successful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/16/ethicalliving.france\">Velib</a> almost-free bicycle scheme), with steady, if not inspired, management of the capital's finances.</p> <p>He recently announced plans for an even more spectacular <a href=\"http://www.paris.fr/portail/accueil/Portal.lut?page_id=95&amp;document_type_id=2&amp;document_id=55226&amp;portlet_id=10045\">Autolib</a> scheme, in which 2,000 small, eco-friendly cars will be available for short-term hire at stands around the city.</p> <p>The 58-year-old downplays his private life, but his homosexuality could well have been a factor in his popularity with the Parisian bobos, or bourgeois bohemians, who swept him to city hall. He's been a card-carrying Socialist since he was 21, and while he may appear affable (if invariably argumentative), the fact that he's flourished in the shark-infested waters of the Paris left demonstrates a ruthless political instinct.</p> <p>Delano\u00eb, even his enemies admit, has principles, but dislikes demagoguery and excessive idealism. He takes few risks; the title of his new book sounds a bit like a personal mantra: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.fr/laudace-Bertrand-Delano%C3%AB/dp/2221110609\">De l'audace!</a> (Dare!). He is said to be the one figure on the left whom Sarkozy respects.</p> <p>But he has, electorally speaking, some drawbacks. First, he has no experience in government. Second, there is his personality: try as he might, Delano\u00eb exudes a cautious, calculating, charisma-free, even aloof public aura that few French voters would define as presidential (although with Sarko in the Elys\u00e9e, what does and does not constitute \"presidential\" is under review).</p> <p>Third, sadly, is the party of which he is a member. France's political parties are rarely united, and even more rarely disciplined. The views of the vicious fraternity that heads up today's Socialist party range, roughly, from Marxist to Blairite, and the belief of each and every one of them that their own view should prevail is far more important than actually winning elections.</p> <p>Delano\u00eb may or may not be the right person to lead France's Socialists, but his ambitions will face the same obstacle as Royal's, who is likely to be his main rival for the post of leader: unless all the party's multitudinous and warring factions can converge in support of whoever they do eventually decide to back, the chances of it reoccupying the Elys\u00e9e palace anytime soon are pretty slim.</p>",
  "<p>What is it that Hillary Clinton's supporters most wanted? Was it Hillary herself? Was it a Democratic ideal? Or was it a female president?</p> <p>Today, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/uselections2008.television\">most pundits are championing her olive branch</a> to the Obama campaign, her heroic bowing out toward party unity. We'll say that her most important line - \"Were you in this campaign just for me?\" \u2013 was meant to gently nudge her supporters to recognise the greater good. But the problem is so-called Puma types and hardcore Hillary fans are angry, not just because their candidate didn't win, but because there are so few other viable women presidential candidates on the horizon. And Clinton didn't do enough to assuage that anger.</p> <p>Partly it's as (and today we agree) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/aug/27/hillaryclinton.democrats2008\">Mike Tomasky noted</a> last night: Clinton should have addressed some of the major issues that divide the parties even more aggressively than she did. That would have meant more about abortion (note that she didn't talk about the party's pro-choice positioning), more on embracing the country's history of immigration in positive terms, more on anti-isolationist foreign policy, more on Obama's ability to be a stellar commander-in-chief.</p> <p>And every time she said those things, and this should have held true for even what she did say last night, she needed to couple every \"I\" in the same breath as \"Obama\". As in, instead of saying \"I ran for president to renew the promise of America.\" She might have said, \"Like Obama, I ran for president to renew the promise of America, and now all of you who believe in that promise should support him, as I do.\"</p> <p>But beyond all that, Clinton missed an opportunity to link the two most important civil rights struggles in American history - civil rights and women's rights - in a mutually reinforcing way to get past the bitter pill women's rights advocates feel is being forced down their throat.</p> <p>The tension between the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_women's_suffrage_in_the_United_States\">women's movement</a> and the African-American civil rights movement is unfortunately nearly as old as both. A handshake from one side to the other, a recognition that these struggles have both needed each other and benefited from each other's successes might have gone a long way in giving the Puma democrats a reason to come around to the Obama camp.</p> <p>Some women will say they have spent too much time, their mothers spent too much time, their grandmothers and great-grandmothers spent too much time, stepping aside for other movements. But this is a mistake. This is the greater tension I think, the catharsis that goes beyond a question of Obama and Clinton themselves.</p> <p>To British readers, some of this might seem a bit ridiculous. But while our two countries <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/amendment_19/\">gave women the right to vote</a> at approximately the same moment nearly 90 years ago, since then we've diverged wildly on women's representation in government. This means the wound of Clinton's loss festers ever deeper, refusing to heal.</p> <p>In the UK you've not only had a woman lead your country (granted, most Guardian readers were and are likely not Thatcherites, but her election and 11 years in office still answers the question of a belief in women's leadership ability in a way that we Yanks have yet to prove to ourselves), you have a far greater pool of women politicians to draw from. You're no Scandinavia, but one in five members of Parliament are women.</p> <p>Contrast that to the US. In the <a href=\"http://womenincongress.house.gov/\">pipeline</a>, things aren't looking as good as they should in 2008. We've only 16 women senators out of 100, 74 female representatives out of 435 and eight women governors out of 50 (this year is an exception, normally we draw our presidential candidates from governors' mansions). </p> <p>Partly as a result of America's continued inability to create affordable childcare options for women, our parties have been unable to woo substantial numbers of women into running for higher office. Granted, groups like <a href=\"http://www.emilyslist.org/\">Emily's List</a> have done an admirable job in electing women (pro-choice women in particular), but the next viable female presidential nominee is \u2026 Hillary Clinton in 2012?</p> <p>This is a problem. And this, I suspect is why the Pumas are really angry. They saw Clinton as their only shot. But they've got their anger misplaced. They should be focused on nurturing other women, the next generation as well as Clinton's, so that they never again find the playing field so bleakly unequal, the future so blankly, uniformly male.</p>",

  "<p>Bill Clinton will skip Barack Obama's acceptance of the Democratic nomination tomorrow night - a move likely to raise tensions the party has worked hard to soothe at its convention in Denver this week.</p> <p>The former's president's anticipated absence, first reported by CNN, comes after Hillary Clinton's well-received address to the convention last night in which she urged her nearly 18 million voters to back Obama as loyally as they did her.</p> <p>Obama will accept the nomination in a speech to a crowd of more than 75,000 at a football stadium.</p> <p>The former president, who campaigned fiercely for his wife, often to the irritation of the Obama camp and some neutral Democrats, is scheduled to address the convention tonight, speaking on foreign policy. </p> <p>Terry McAuliffe - the former Democratic party chairman and Hillary Clinton campaign boss, cheerleader and top fundraiser - is also skipping the speech, having told MSNBC television yesterday that he was heading home to be with his children.</p> <p>Many rank-and-file Hillary Clinton supporters said they would leave town after her speech last night. According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll, 42% of Clinton voters say they are \"solidly behind\" Obama.</p> <p>Another 20% say they plan to vote for the Republican nominee, John McCain, even though he is solidly anti-abortion, staunchly supports the war in Iraq and differs dramatically from Clinton on most other policies.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton is expected to be at Obama's speech. As one of the most prominent senators in the US government, she would wield tremendous power under an Obama administration.</p> <p>The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Prominent Democrats rose early in Denver today to praise Hillary Clinton's speech and work up excitement about their candidate, with a special eye towards winning over recalcitrant Clinton backers.</p> <p>James Clyburn of South Carolina, the most senior African American in the House of Representatives, said that no matter what Clinton told her supporters, it was up to Obama to convince them and the rest of America he is ready for the White House.</p> <p>\"What she did last night is create a climate in which he can deliver his speech [and] connect with the American people,\" Clyburn said on CNN.</p> <p>The former Democratic senate leader Tom Daschle said: \"She brought the house down. That was the single finest speech I've ever heard Hillary Clinton give. She blew the roof off ... She said, 'It's not about me.' If you're a woman who cares deeply about the issues that we care about, you're going to support Barack Obama. She said that powerfully last night.\"</p> <p>Charles Schumer, Clinton's fellow US senator from New York, told MSNBC: \"The speech went over great.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton had a job to do last night, and the rapidly emerging consensus was that she did it. Until she took to the podium, the convention had felt rather low-key - no surprise, since emphasising Barack and Michelle Obama's comfy familiarity had been the goal. But Clinton's message of unity - peppered with plenty of strikes against John McCain and George Bush \u2014 set the venue alight. Though self-congratulation certainly wasn't lacking, Clinton drove home the point that, <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=08&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=hillary#108629\">in the words of the blogger Ezra Klein</a>, she was \"a Democrat, not a Hillaryite\" \u2014 an unmistakeable signal to her most hardline supporters that they had to move beyond anger at the failure of her candidacy.</p> <p>Obama is due in Denver tonight, in advance of his open-air nomination speech tomorrow. But Clinton's speech doesn't mean party unity is now a given: the other Clinton is due to speak today, and Obama campaign aides are reportedly worried about what he might say, because he'll say whatever he likes.</p> <h2>Today at the convention</h2> <p>Today's official theme is \"Securing America's Future\", and the keynote speaker today is Obama's running-mate Joe Biden, another man not averse to a bit of loose-cannon ad-libbing.

  "<p>The Ukrainian president today condemned Russia for recognising as independent the rebel Georgian territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p> <p>Viktor Yushchenko said the decision was \"unacceptable\" and threatened security in countries of the former Soviet Union. </p> <p>The foreign secretary, David Miliband, is due to make a speech in Ukraine today condemning Russia's decision. He said he was visiting Kiev in an attempt to assemble the \"widest possible coalition against Russian aggression\".</p> <p>Miliband's French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner, warned that Russia might have its eye on other neighbouring countries such as Ukraine and Moldova after its invasion of Georgia.</p> <p>France, which holds the rotating EU presidency, has called an emergency meeting of EU leaders next week to review the relationship between Russia and Europe.</p> <p>Kouchner told Europe 1 radio that it was \"not impossible\" Russia would now regularly choose to confront the west rather than cooperate with it. \"There are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for Russia, in particular the Crimea, Ukraine and Moldova.\" </p> <p>Like Georgia, Ukraine has a pro-western president who wants his country to join Nato, an idea that angers the Kremlin. Ukraine has a large Russian-speaking population, but is much bigger than Georgia. </p> <p>Russia's Black Sea fleet is docked at the port of Sevastopol in the Crimea, southern Ukraine, under a lease that runs until 2017, and most people who live there are ethnic Russians. </p> <p>Yushchenko said Ukraine might try to raise the cost of leasing the Sevastopol base to the Black Sea fleet, a renegotiation Moscow has said would break a 1997 agreement. </p> <p>The Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, is hoping to drum up support from eastern allies at a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) tomorrow.</p> <p>Russia's allies in the former Soviet Union, Asia and elsewhere, who traditionally side with the Kremlin against the west on contentious issues, are not expected to give their backing at the summit in Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe. </p> <p>The biggest prize for Russia would be to win the support of China when Medvedev meets the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, at the summit. Alexey Mukhin, head of the Centre of Political Information thinktank, said this was unlikely. \"China, which has its own separatists, will be the biggest problem. The recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia is unacceptable for Beijing.\"</p> <p>Nearly three-quarters (71%) of Russians believe Moscow should recognise the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and almost two-thirds (63%) think Moscow should agree to absorb the two regions into Russia should the separatists request it, according to a poll published today.</p> <p>Russian pollster VTsIOM said one in 10 of the 1,594 Russians polled opposed Moscow's recognition of the two breakaway regions.</p> <p>Medvedev has been accused of inflaming the crisis with his independence declaration. \"We are not afraid of anything, including the prospect of a new cold war,\" Medvedev told a news agency. \"But we don't want it, and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners.\" </p> <p>He said the west would have to \"understand the reason behind\" the decision to recognise the regions if it wanted to preserve good relations with Russia. </p> <p>Miliband said Moscow's recognition of the two regions was \"unjustifiable and unacceptable\" \u2013 a line also taken by the US president, George Bush, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.</p> <p>Bush condemned Medvedev's decision as irresponsible and inconsistent with UN security council resolutions and the French-brokered ceasefire plan. \"Russia's action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations,\" he said.</p> <p>A German government statement said Merkel spoke with Medvedev by phone this morning and demanded the \"immediate implementation\" of the EU ceasefire. It said Merkel viewed the continuing presence of Russian troops in Georgia outside the separatist provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as a \"serious violation\" of that plan.</p>",

Radical Islamic government. Known sponsors of terrorism. Developing nuclear capabilities to \"generate power\" but threatening to eliminate Israel. Obama says Iran is a \"tiny\" country, \"doesn't pose a serious threat\". Terrorism, destroying Israel, those aren't \"serious threats\"? Obama -- dangerously unprepared to be president.</p> <p>JOHN MCCAIN: I'm John McCain and I approved this message.</p> <p>Read on...</p> <p>Here's a real quick fact check:</p> <p>Obama didn't quite say Iran is \"tiny\" and doesn't \"pose a serious threat\". What he said, in Oregon in May, was: \"Iran, Cuba, Venezuela -- these countries are tiny compared to the Soviet Union. They don't pose a serious threat to us the way the Soviet Union posed a threat to us.\" He went on to advocate direct engagement of the sort John F. Kennedy had with Nikita Khrushchev. And Nixon had with Mao. And Reagan had with Gorbachev.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in a June speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Obama in no uncertain terms acknowledged the threat the Iranian regime does play. He said, \"There is no greater threat to Israel - or to the peace and stability of the region - than Iran.\"</p> <p>The US spent 45 years doing its best to avoid a hot war with the Soviet Union, and we were successful (leaving aside, for argument's sake, the millions dead in cold-war proxy battles like Vietnam, Afghanistan, Angola, Chile and elsewhere). We won the cold war by serving as a moral beacon to the repressed people behind the Iron Curtain and by allowing the Soviet Union to collapse under its own failed economic and political system. We didn't win by bombing them or by rattling the sabre and frightening them into submission.</p> <p>Obama has made it clear he doesn't want war with Iran, a country of 66m with the most unambiguously pro-American population in the middle east. McCain jokes about bombing the country. An ancient people, the Persians are fiercely proud, and are not likely to roll over if the US bombs their nuclear power plants.</p> <p>I don't sense a popular will in the US to go to war with Iran, and my guess is Americans hear in McCain's anti-Iran rhetoric strong echoes of Bush's drive to war with Iraq. That's why I expect this advert might do more harm than good.</p> <p>UPDATE:</p> <p>Obama campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan says:</p> <blockquote> <p>John McCain is distorting Barack Obama's words to cover up for the fact that it's the failed Bush-McCain approach to foreign policy and the Bush-McCain war in Iraq that that have strengthened Iran and endangered Israel. While Barack Obama recognizes that Iran has been the biggest beneficiary of the war in Iraq and that the Bush-McCain fear of tough diplomacy has allowed Iran to spin 3800 centrifuges, threaten Israel, and fund terrorism, John McCain promises more of the same. If John McCain was serious about dealing with the threat from Iran, he would join Barack Obama's bipartisan effort in the Senate to step up sanctions on Iran instead of adopting the same tired, old Bush-Rove playbook.</p> </blockquote>",

The three men - all said to have been high on methamphetamine when arrested - are the subject of an assassination investigation, but so far, authorities say, it appears they had no capacity to carry out any attack on Obama.</p> <p>A Colorado federal prosecutor, Troy Eid, said the vague racist threats from the men would continue to be investigated. He said he did not know whether Obama had been briefed on the arrests or whether security plans would change for his acceptance speech on Thursday.</p> <p>Court documents had one man quoting another as speaking of wanting to kill Obama on his inauguration day by using a sniper rifle to shoot him from high ground. The comments amount to the \"the racist ramblings of three meth heads\", Eid insisted.</p> <p>The three men were arrested after a truck containing drugs, guns and ammunition was stopped on the outskirts of Denver. The driver was named as Tharin Gartrell. Shawn Adolf, who wore a swastika ring and was wanted on drug charges, was arrested when police came to the hotel where he was staying in a Denver suburb. He jumped from the sixth floor, landing on a flat roof and breaking his ankle. He tried to run but was arrested.</p> <p>The third man, Nathan Johnson, was arrested at an upmarket hotel in Denver. His statements to police during an eight-hour interview appeared to have raised fears of a threat to Obama. In an interview with a local CBS station while in custody, Johnson accused the other two men of making racist statements about Obama. He said they had spoken about shooting Obama on the day of his speech, saying: \"He don't belong in political office or blacks don't belong in political office.\" Johnson denied being involved in the plot.</p> <p>Concerns about the safety of Obama, who would be America's first African American president should he win in November, led the US secret service to provide round-the-clock protection from early in his bid.</p> <p>Some white supremacist groups would like to see Obama killed, according to Mark Potok, an expert in neo-Nazi groups at the Southern Poverty Law Centre in Alabama. Threats against Obama were circulating on the internet, said Potok, whose organisation monitors and opposes hate groups.</p> <p>He cited a threat posted on the law centre's website in April that read, with a misspelled word: \"ATTENTION, IF OBAMA BECOMES PRESEDANT I WILL KILL HIM MYSELF MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT.\"</p> <p>Potok said white supremacists overwhelmingly believe the Colorado case was a set-up by authorities determined to smash their groups. He based his assertion on information gleaned from neo-Nazi websites.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday August 29 2008.

  "<p>Leading up to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/27/uselections2008.hillaryclinton1\">Hillary Clinton's Democratic convention speech</a> on Tuesday night, there was what could be charitably described as a wee bit of pressure being put on her by the talking heads in America's Cable News Land, who carefully laid out their perfectly reasonable expectations: Clinton was to unify the party; she was to make a strong case for an Obama presidency; she was to obliterate McCain; she was to honour her supporters; she was to be deferential, but strong; she was to be gracious; she was to be supportive; she was to be persuasive; she was to be authentic; she was to be witty; and she was, above all, to be flawless.</p> <p>Because anything less than all of the above, perfectly executed, would be deemed a disaster.</p> <p>Hours before showtime, I found myself captivated by the ringleaders <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/petulant/video/x6k7zb_the-talking-heads-anticipate-hillar_news\">at cable news channel MSNBC</a>: David Gregory and Keith Olbermann, wearing their politically non-committal purple ties, and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/17/AR2008011702828.html\">Chris Matthews</a>, looking like he'd escaped from an asylum, his mad, windblown hair and the evident dearth of combs in the whole of Denver lending an even more maniacal air to his usual madcap blathering.</p> <p>Only Hillary and Bill Clinton can quiet their supporters and unite the party, intoned Gregory sagely, during a Very Serious Discussion about whether the Clintons would try to \"make the convention about them\" or support Obama, as if it was seriously conceivable that two of the most resolutely partisan Democrats in the nation would try to hijack a party convention in a totally illogical play for legacy.</p> <p>The surreality did not stop there, as every new hypothetical, every flourish, seemed pulled from a parallel dimension. There were implications that Clinton was making last-minute refinements to her speech just to keep it from being properly vetted; \"It's hard to harmonize when you don't know the tune,\" Matthews said, more than once. Joe Scarborough jumped in to wonder what \"got the Obamas and Clintons together\" over the past few days, as if there haven't been, for weeks, disavowals from both camps that negotiations were tense or rife with animus, as if the narrative of disunity were not a wholesale media creation from the get-go.</p> <p>And then the coup de grace, as Olbermann <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXtPonA2opk\">noted</a> that \"people have questioned what Senator Clinton's motives might be going into this speech,\" then pondered, sincerely, \"Is it possible, and I know in this cynical year it seems almost silly to ask this question, but is it just not possible that she could genuinely believe that the nation can't sustain itself with another four years of Republican rule and that that's the motivation going into tonight's speech for her?\" This is what it had come to at last \u2013 the possibility that Clinton has integrity was being discussed like the remotest possibility in the multiverse, something \"silly\" to consider, the idea that Clinton is motivated primarily by not wanting Republicans to win presented as the zaniest outlier of all conceivable motivations.</p> <p>It was, perhaps, too much to expect that reason could penetrate the MSNBC bubble inside which Olbermann is cloistered \u2013 and supporting evidence for the void of said reason soon presented itself in the gruesome spectre of Pat Buchanan, <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/03/why-is-this-racist-superfuck-still-on.html\">still considered an appropriate national commentator</a>, despite the fact that he should long ago have been relegated to the dustbin of history, unfit to comment on bullfrog racing, no less the Democratic convention.</p> <p>When we catch up with the manic Matthews again, he is in full meltdown, barking at Clinton supporter Lisa Caputo questions about how the Clintons are going to win the White House back for the Clinton family. Caputo laughs at his suggestion that the Clintons have a \"restoration plan\" to recapture the White House. \"I'm SERIOUS,\" he insists. Yes, that's precisely the problem, you crazy, crazy man.</p> <p>Shortly thereafter, while Matthews engages Chuck Todd in more <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=zomg\">ZOMG</a> Clinton Apocalypse chatter, MSNBC puts up one of the most laughably ridiculous graphics I have ever seen. The narrative, of course, as it has been all evening, is that Clinton's wild-eyed, rogue supporters are going to defect and vote for McCain in large numbers. The graphic that goes up is labeled, approximately, \"Clinton Supporters Who Don't Support Obama,\" and shows that 50% of them have an unfavorable view of Obama and \"only\" 24% of them have an unfavorable view of McCain. Naturally, we're not meant to notice that this is only among Clinton supporters who don't support Obama \u2013 we're meant instead to infer that there's a possibility that fully 50% of all of Clinton's supporters won't vote for Obama. This is beyond a joke. This is dishonest hoodwinkery in service of a bullshit narrative.</p> <p>Moments before Clinton is to take the stage, MSNBC's coverage reaches its nadir, as Matthews and Olbermann obsess about Bill Clinton's proximity to a \"Unity\" sign. Even Freud would have told these guys to settle down.</p> <p>Then comes <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/us/politics/27text-clinton.html\">the speech</a>.</p> <p>It is unifying. She makes a strong case for an Obama presidency. She obliterates McCain. She honours her supporters. She is deferential, but strong. She is gracious. She is supportive. She is persuasive. She is authentic. She is witty. She is flawless.</p> <p>And because she is always, always an A student, she goes for the extra credit and throws in some great cheeky and self-deprecating lines \u2013 \"You made me laugh \u2026 and cry\"; \"Sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits\" \u2013 some nice catch phrases \u2013 \"No way. No how. No McCain.\" \u2013 and a fabulous line about the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-St Paul being the appropriate location for the GOP convention, given that you hardly tell Bush and McCain apart these days.</p> <p>Halfway through, CNN sends out a breaking news email: \"Sen Hillary Clinton tells convention delegates: 'Barack Obama is my candidate. And he must be our president'.\" As if she didn't endorse him two months ago.</p> <p>When she is finished, Olbermann is apoplectic. He declares it a grand slam \u2013 says he doesn't know how it could have been better. Matthews gushes that it was \"eyes wide open exuberance.\"</p> <p>Over at CNN, my doppelganger Candy Crowley, who hasn't gone to the bathroom in two days s she can sit in front of a camera, says that Clinton turned neatly on its head the meme that the Clintons made the race about them. Gloria Borger can't remember such a magnanimous loser! \"Her generosity was astonishing.\" James Carville deems it \"a bad night for Hillary haters.\"</p> <p>(The only less than enthusiastic comment comes from GOP operative Alex Castellanos, who dismisses the speech as not particularly powerful. Of course, he also uses decades-old misogynist references <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/08/hillary-sexism-watch-109.html\">to demean Hillary Clinton on a regular night</a>, so I think we can safely dismiss him as a total fucking idiot.)</p> <p>Now, it seems, that she stands no chance of being president, the media can <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/rapids/ci_10311363\">finally</a> be complimentary of Senator Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>But not for long.</p> <p>For only a fleeting moment could time stand still and everyone, save the most incorrigible Republican partisans, gaze admiringly at a woman who was given an impossible task and pulled it off, with graceful aplomb. For only the briefest of time could we all look at Clinton as she is, and not as she has been constructed through truncated soundbites and decades-old lies. For an instant, we could, irrespective of our opinions of her politics, glimpse her as a full person \u2013 a talented and compelling speaker, a leader who loves her party and her country, and is perhaps not, in the end, the voracious vortex of unrelenting ego and avarice that she is said to be, but a rather cooperative sort who genuinely would like to see her supporters elect Barack Obama.</p> <p>And then the spell is broken. On CNN, Anderson Cooper invokes Larry King, who appears in the split-screen looking like grim death. King enthusiastically promises to talk to Republicans who hope to benefit from the remaining divisiveness out there.</p> <p>And all I can think is: Of course you do.</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/27/uselections2008.hillaryclinton1\">rallies behind Barack Obama at the Democratic convention</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton's role at the Democratic National Convention has been the source of much media speculation. Some sections of the media have given the impression that she and her husband intended to hijack the convention and divide Democrats, while her own comments about \"catharsis\" for her supporters led many to question exactly what form that would take.</p> <p>The tension and anticipation before Senator Clinton took the stage was palpable, with every word and the way in which they were uttered about to come under intense scrutiny. The importance of Clinton's speech could not \u2013 and cannot \u2013 be underestimated. With a large number of her supporters reluctant to support Obama, her words had the potential to deepen splits and divisions amongst Democrats. </p> <p>It soon became clear, however, that healing divisions is what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/27/uselections2008.hillaryclinton1\">Hillary Clinton came to do</a> - and she did it very well. In a powerful and well-executed speech she called on her supporters to get behind Obama, declaring herself a \"proud supporter\" of his within the first few minutes. Throughout the speech, she was convincing and persuasive on the issue of party unity and stated \u2013 to rapturous applause \u2013 that the attitude of her supporters should be \"No way, no how and no McCain\", a plea no doubt to the 28% of Clinton-supporting Democrats who have considered defecting to McCain rather than voting for Obama.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton could not and would not have, as the media suspected and perhaps even hoped, messed up this speech. Not only would it not have been in the party's interests, but it wouldn't have been best for her own political career. Reiterating her policies and reasons for running with strength, forthrightness and confidence, it was clear that Hillary Clinton still has eyes on the presidency and was not about to undermine that. She was determined to leave the stage with a bang, reminding all of us that with \"the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children, campaigning for universal health care, helping parents balance work and family, and fighting for women's rights at home and around the world,\" she would still make a formidable candidate in 2012. </p> <p>This speech was hard to criticise. Clinton delivered in the right combinations: she was both strong and humble; authentic and sincere; appeasing and commanding to her supporters; self-affirming while also conceding to Obama. Bowing out with grace, she credited both Michelle Obama \u2013 \"a terrific partner\" and a potentially \"great First Lady For America\" \u2013 and vice-presidential pick Joe Biden, who she described as \"pragmatic, tough and wise\". Calling Obama by name no fewer than 10 times, she rightly emphasised the close links and similarities between their policies, giving a strong case for why her supporters should rally around him. </p> <p>On the 88th anniversary of women's voting rights, her role as the strongest female potential Democratic nominee was at the forefront of her speech. More than ever before she appealed directly to feminists, particularly those apparently in need of \"catharsis\" in order to move forward. Thankfully, the catharsis was there but not in the drawn-out, over-emotional and hyper-sensitive way that some were expecting that it would be. Thanking all of them for their support and encouragement, she bluntly asked them: \"Were you in this campaign just for me?... [or] were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible?\" While her loyal supporters may not have expected her to speak to them in that way, it was definitely necessary. </p> <p>The most important issue, however, is whether or not her supporters were convinced \u2013 and whether or not her speech will make a difference when it comes to their votes. During her speech, Senator Clinton failed to address the issue that is still a sticking point for Obama's campaign, and for which she herself attacked him during the primaries: his experience and whether or not he is ready to lead. The Republicans are airing ads which feature Clinton's own words on this matter, one of which shows her saying: \"I know Senator McCain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the White House, and Senator Obama has a speech he gave in 2002.\" While Clinton talked at some length about the dangers of voting for McCain, whose tenure would be \"four more years of the last eight years\", the fact that she did not directly address that matter gives the Republicans more fodder with which to undermine Obama.</p> <p>Hillary's speech may even have had the effect of leaving her supporters even more convinced that she would indeed have made the better presidential nominee. While Obama is well known for his oratory, Clinton showed herself to be a powerful speaker. Cutting a dashing figure in orange, she looked every inch the stateswoman and some of the delegates, interviewed afterwards on CNN, even described her speech as \"presidential\". </p> <p>In sum, however, Hillary ticked the right boxes. It was a unifying speech. It wasn't, as some had feared, an opportunity to be egotistical or divisive, focusing instead on the Democrats and the need for change for America.</p> <p>Hillary did a great job \u2026 so, why isn't she the vice-president nominee, again?</p>",
  "<p>\"The west\": we say it all the time. \"What will the west do to combat this hardline Russian regime, about Georgia?\" Nothing actually, apart from froth and affirmation at the Nato meeting where <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/newsroom/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=5519684\">Miliband</a> sounded like Gulliver in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brobdingnag\">Brobdingnag</a>.</p> <p>This foxed and worn-down term, \"the west\", is itself at issue. It has been used so often with so little thought by so many not-very-resourceful journalists that it comes out tired. There is often a hint of self-pity about it. Oswald Spengler wrote Der Untergang des Abendlandes (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0394421795/ref=sib_dp_pt#reader-link\">The Decline of the West</a>), a book I am happy to know only by report. Hans Carossa, a pretty fair German poet, wrote, in 1945, a long lament beginning \"O Abendland\".</p> <p>In darker moments, contemplating the American vice-president who recently compared that rough but rational Vladimir Putin with \"A-dolf Hitler\", I reckon that the fearful American right, which has so many <a href=\"http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/chapter.cfm?subsection_id=65\">1913 impulses</a>, thinks in translation. There used to be a phrase, not much used now, but familiar down in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie\">Dixie</a>: \"White, western, Christian civilisation.\" Well nothing wrong with shorthand. For along with the self-pity, there is triumphalism. No inconsistency there. In the world of geopolitics, bang and whimper march arm-in-arm.</p> <p>Today, \"the west\" means the US and those who follow it. Yet the expression had an innocent, honourable descent. In 1948, when Jan <a href=\"http://www.radio.cz/en/article/24973\">Masaryk</a>, foreign minister of what was trying to be a pluralist Czechoslovakia, was found dead, \"suicid\u00e9\", candidly murdered beneath a ministry window, \"the west\" meant something.</p> <p>The Soviet Union and its roll-call of quite horrible minions, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klement_Gottwald\">Gottwald</a>, Rakosi, Fierlinger, <a href=\"http://www.germannotes.com/hist_walter_ulbricht.shtml\">Ulbricht</a>, actually was a great alien darkness rolling toward us. Getting on a bit, but, precocious in our infancy, some of us had our politics defined then. In the same way, the US of <a href=\"http://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/\">Ike</a> and for that matter, Lucille Ball, seemed a pretty good place. But as Tony Blair likes to say, \"We must move on\" \u2013 and Russia has! Vladimir Putin is the leader whom humiliated Russians chose in order to stop being humiliated. Destituted under an abject Americanising drunkard, that country is clenched with resentment.</p> <p>In the longer term, fear of Stalin and distrust of his successors produced an idle clich\u00e9, certainly, in Britain's consciousness. Our governments and press have done the trudging good soldier deep into the era of white phosphorus over Fallujah.</p> <p>But \"the west\" needs more than the British, and the impression forms that, tentatively, the platoon is malingering. Consider those European nations not reporting a couple of soldiers dead every week in Afghanistan. \"They are,\" says the plucky, scornful British voice, \"back at base.\" What a sensible place to be!</p> <p>When the Americans occupied (active verb) Afghanistan, they created a country which is \"occupied\" (past participle). Valiant, decisive action, initially approved in Europe and, for a few months, accepted by Afghans, has been replaced by a state of promiscuous war, generating resentment then hatred by the occupied for the occupiers. National leaders keeping their troops back at base are letting Gordon Brown down. They put far too high a value on their soldiers' lives.</p> <p>In Spain four years ago, a hideous al-Qaida <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/31/spain\">explosion</a> killed scores of innocent people. There was an election due \u2013 remember. The outgoing premier, Jos\u00e9-Mar\u00eda Aznar, (former Franquista), was very loyal to America, so, Spanish soldiers were serving in the \"coalition\". Whom to blame for the bomb? Anybody except al-Qaida, anything but revenge for Iraq. It was intolerable for the deaths to have been triggered by \"western solidarity\". Nobody believed Aznar. Previous polls had put him ahead. The election threw him out.</p> <p>What anyway was the American sense in nodding through a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3231852.stm\">mini-Aznar</a> to attack the Russian minority and lose that province for ever? Incidentally, Putin's brief incursion makes an interesting contrast with the long defile through which \"the west\" trudges in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> <p>Angela Merkel may have been pulled into line over Georgia, but she had made her point. Nato is \"the west\" in military form, the toy of some increasingly frightening, mostly southern-states, politicians. If its purpose has been to nudge against resentful borders, what good, decent, civilised purpose does it serve?</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton's speech to the Democratic convention was a miracle of multi-tasking.</p> <p>There were three simultaneous tasks awaiting her when she walked out on stage in her tangerine pants suit. </p> <p>She had to dispel any notion that she was not now solidly with Barack Obama. Any sign of doubt would fuel efforts by the Republicans to chip away at his support and legitimacy as the Democratic nominee.</p> <p>She had to persuade her supporters that Obama would now carry forward the populist themes that had dominated her campaign, and get them fired up about taking on John McCain.</p> <p>She had to provide some sense of closure to women voters who had invested so deeply in her campaign, giving them a sense of achievement even in defeat.</p> <p>Clinton carried off all three challenges in a powerful speech that brought the hall to its feet.</p> <p>The problem though for Clinton and the Democrats was not necessarily in the conventional hall where party delegates are experienced enough to recognise the need for moving on.</p> <p>Clinton had to make sure that her message carried to a wider audience of supporters - some relative newcomers to the political process - who are now threatening to vote for McCain.</p> <p>That constituency, loosely associated with the party is going to be hard to reach. They are also unlikely to be persuaded to give up after a night of watching Clinton appear so thoroughly in command - even presidential.</p> <p>But that is not entirely her fault. Clinton, true to form, was thorough. She left no doubt that she was now supporting Obama's campaign, and made a compelling intellectual argument that he would carry forward the issues she championed.</p> <p>Of course, she could have gone farther. Clinton made no attempt to disown some of the more cutting comments of the primary campaign - now regularly cropping up in Republican attack ads - in which she said Obama was not ready to be in the White House.</p> <p>Clinton also dwelled a little too deeply on the history of her own campaign, and for a few perilous moments it seemed like she was veering off into one of her stump speeches.</p> <p>She made up for those lapses with a series of stinging critiques against McCain, making it clear that he was not a legitimate alternative for her disaffected supporters.</p> <p>But that was the relatively easy part. The real challenge for Clinton was to perform some kind of emotional alchemy on those die-hard supporters who are still unable to let go.</p> <p>Many of Clinton's women supporters had seen her as a feminist icon. They saw in her run for the White House, which ultimately saw her overtaken by a younger man, parallels with their own lives. </p> <p>Clinton, in her defeat, was the embodiment of their own personal disappointments. </p> <p>But she provided them with the validation they needed, situating her campaign in American feminist history.</p> <p>And while Clinton's run for the White House has ended, her supporters could also claim some satisfaction that the Obama campaign was utterly ungrudging in her big night.</p> <p>There was a video tribute as sentimental as the one the night before for Ted Kennedy, narrated by daughter, Chelsea. As she spoke, convention organisers distributed white signs emblazoned with her signature, allowing Clinton to look out on a convention emblazoned with her name.</p> <p>And if there was any lingering doubt that Hillary Clinton could now claim her place in US political history, the video dispelled it. The clip of Bill Clinton in the video tribute was labelled simply \"Hillary's husband\".</p>",
  "<p>Democratic delegates were largely elated tonight by Hillary Clinton's endorsement of Barack Obama, praising her focus on unity even as some wondered whether her words would be enough to pull the party together.</p> <p>\"Hillary Clinton hit all the right moves,\" Greg Holt of Pennsylvania said. </p> <p>\"She made it very clear to her delegates - and I'm one of hers - how critical it is to get behind Barack Obama.\"</p> <p>Asked whether Clinton had successfully soothed the wounded pride of her faithful backers, however, Holt was cautious. </p> <p>\"For the short term, they're going to feel even worse,\" he said. \"They're going to say, 'this is the speech she should've given on Thursday [accepting the nomination]. But ultimately, they'll get behind Barack Obama.\"</p> <p>Verna Cleveland of Atlanta, another Clinton delegate, said Clinton \"brought it home \u2026 she's got a lot of class\". </p> <p>\"I never disliked Obama - I liked Hillary better,\" Cleveland said. \"There will still be a small percentage of people who won't let it go, but most Democrats want to win and keep our eyes on the prize.\"</p> <p>Many delegates were still repeating some of Clinton's biggest lines as they left the convention floor, particularly her comparison of John McCain and George Bush to the \"Twin Cities\" of Minneapolis and St Paul, where Republicans will host their convention next week.</p> <p>The Twin Cities pun is \"something we should be pushing every time somebody says [it] next week\", Maine delegate Robert O'Brien said. </p> <p>O'Brien admitted being \"concerned about whether she'd be holding back at all, but it was clear from the beginning that she was fully in support of Barack Obama\".</p> <p>Several Clinton-ites pointedly hoped that the speech would put to rest any lingering tensions between the two Democratic factions.</p> <p>\"She got the message across, that her supporters need to come and get behind Barack Obama,\" Sue Levitan of Maryland said. \"I think she sincerely means it \u2026 I hope people don't keep looking for cracks.\"</p> <p>Rosina Rubin, a Clinton delegate from the former first lady's home district in New York, hailed the speech as \"extraordinary\" yet acknowledged that cracks might still remain.</p> <p>\"We're going to be sad until tomorrow at least,\" she said. \"Tomorrow's going to be a day of closure.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Obama supporters such as Daniel Craig of Detroit were pleased to see Clinton heal the wounds opened during her unsuccessful campaign.</p> <p>\"She reached out for all of the different segments \u2026 she even appealed to the African-American community that she had problems with in the primaries,\" Craig said.</p> <p>Referring to Clinton's invocation of black anti-slavery leader Harriet Tubman, Craig marvelled that \"she did her homework, she touched on something dear to African-Americans\".</p> <p>Cal Williams, the co-chairman of Alaska's delegation, openly joined female and black Democrats in his kind words for Clinton.</p> <p>\"Those who were pissed off [by Clinton's loss] might never come around, but those who were hurt, I think it'll heal their pain,\" he said. \"I understand their pain. Being a black man, I've felt it numerous times.\"</p>",
  "<p>In terms of accomplishing what it needed to accomplish, sure, Hillary Clinton's speech was a home run, a grand slam, a tape-measure shot across Waveland Avenue (look that up, and without a link!). </p> <p>But I can't help but feel the same feeling I've felt watching lots of her speeches, and believe me, I have. It could have been a lot more. </p> <p>I strove to watch this thing from the point of view of one of her supporters \u2013 the one in five of her primary-season voters \u2013 who not only did not vote for but actively does not like Barack Obama. Who are these people?</p> <p>They may be immature politically. And they are. I have made my views on that clear. But they aren't stupid. They know John McCain has pledged to put anti-abortion judges on the bench. They know John McCain has moved to the right on taxes and drilling and loads of things. They are well aware of all the logical and rational reasons that they shouldn't be flirting with voting for John McCain, but they're thinking about it anyway.</p> <p>Did this speech persuade them? I'm honestly not sure. For all her general avowals in Obama's behalf, there were a few specific things she did not do in the speech. </p> <p>First, she didn't vouch at all for Obama's character. She didn't say anything like, \"I have served in the Senate with this man, and I competed with him on the campaign trail for nearly two years. And as heated as things got sometimes, I can tell you that he is a person of profound judgment and decency and heft who will be a great leader,\" or something along those lines. Establishing that she had some degree of personal affinity for the nominee would have hit the Pumas in the breadbasket. She chose not to do it. </p> <p>Second, she didn't say anything about Obama's ability as commander-in-chief. I'd argue she was under a special obligation to do this, at the very moment when McCain is running an ad using her famous quote from February in which she said that she and McCain brought a lifetime of experience to the job of leading America in the world, while Obama had a speech he gave in 2002. I honestly thought that she would reference that ad specifically and say something like, \"Well, I'm Hillary Clinton, and I do not approve that message.\" </p> <p>Imagine the applause. But she left all that hanging. And indeed the statement the McCain campaign issued immediately after the speech drove this point home, pointing out that Clinton had said nothing about Obama's ability to be the commander-in-chief. And I have to think the omission was conscious. </p> <p>Third, it was interesting to me how she articulated the stakes of people opposing Obama. \"I want you to ask yourselves,\" she said. \"Were you in this campaign just for me? Or were you in it for\" various unfortunate citizens she'd discussed previously. That was the traditional \"invisible people\" trope she used often during the primaries. </p> <p>Well, that was her trope, but it wasn't Obama's, and it just struck me as an odd way to make the argument for why any Democrat just has to vote Democratic instead of voting Republican. You have to vote Democratic because you don't believe in starting hideous wars of choice; because you care what the rest of the world thinks of us; because you don't want to let one of America's great cities die from incompetence and neglect; because you honor and cherish the constitution; because you believe that government agencies should do what they are professionally assigned to do, and not conduct ideological witch hunts; because you want a government that answers to the people and doesn't manipulate them and strike fear into them.</p> <p>Clinton instead cited: jobs going overseas, oil company profits and the need to build a green economy. Look, these are important things. But they are focused-grouped things, and they are at this point practically throw-away lines. She did not, to my thinking, drill down to the kinds of specifics that would punch liberal women (and some men) \u2013 the people who are here in Denver and were raptly watching \u2013 in the stomach and make them understand, \"Wow, maybe I really am being kinda stupid here.\" </p> <p>She also didn't really attack McCain very hard. George Bush's name was mentioned just once. About one-eighth of the speech was devoted to McCain. And she just didn't say that Obama is ready for the Oval Office, which is a big part of her backers' opposition to him.</p> <p>She's getting great reviews tonight, as I'm writing, and I can understand why. Cable television will probably quiet down on the disunity meme for a while. There were plenty of positive sound bites.</p> <p>But I will bet anyone my mortgage: in one or two weeks, some polls will come out, and the TV pundits will marvel, \"So that barn-burning Hillary Clinton speech didn't create party unity after all.\" She left too much unsaid tonight. And the unity, I still think, will come, but it will come in October. And it will come more because of him than her. But in the short term, she did at least manage to change a negative narrative \u2013 at least for 24 hours, until her husband speaks, which is the next drama.</p>",

A proud mother. A proud Democrat. A proud American. And a proud supporter of Barack Obama,\" she said, opening her speech.</p> <p>Demonstrating the party discipline she has shown throughout her political career, she repeated the call for party unity at regular intervals throughout the 25-minute speech. \"We are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines,\" she said.</p> <p>Die-hard Clintonites have taken comfort in her earlier pronouncements, saying they were ambiguous. But there was no ambiguity in her speech last night.</p> <p>Each of her calls for unity was greeted with loud cheers, suggesting the party was beginning the process of coming together.</p> <p>The resistance threatened by her most fervent supporters appears to be petering out. A formal roll call of her support is likely to be held at the convention today but it will only be symbolic. </p> <p>The dominance by the Clintons of the Democratic party for most of the last two decades appears to be just about over. But if Obama was to lose in November, Clinton could hope to try again in 2012.</p> <p>The convention acknowledged her tenacity in the fight with Obama for the Democratic nomination - the first woman to come so close - by giving her a three-minute standing ovation. The hall turned into a sea of white and blue Hillary placards.</p> <p>She was introduced by her daughter Chelsea who described her as her hero and husband Bill watched from the sidelines</p> <p>She paid tribute to those who had backed her campaign. \"To my supporters, my champions - my sisterhood of the travelling pantsuits - from the bottom of my heart: thank you. You never gave in. You never gave up. And together we made history.\"</p> <p>In a speech free of rancour or resentment, she loyally made the case for Obama and his vice-presidential running mate, Joe Biden.</p> <p>\"I ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years. Those are the reasons I ran for president. Those are the reasons I support Barack Obama. And those are the reasons you should too,\" she said.</p> <p>She indulged in just one jibe at Obama, over healthcare, in which she favours the speedy introduction of universal care while he prefers a phased approach. \"I can't wait to watch Barack Obama sign a healthcare plan into law that covers every single American,\" she said.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, she formally released her 1,896 supporters from pledges to vote for her at the convention, a symbolic move that frees them to vote for Obama in a show of party unity.</p> <p>The speech by the woman who has gone further than any other in US politics coincided with the 88th anniversary of the adoption of the constitutional amendment that gave women the right to vote,</p> <p>In contrast with the first day of the convention, which many delegates criticised for failing to land punches on the Republicans, Clinton rounded on both president George Bush and the Republican candidate, John McCain.</p> <p>\"John McCain says the economy is fundamentally sound. John McCain doesn't think that 47m people without health insurance is a crisis. John McCain wants to privatise social security. And in 2008, he still thinks it is okay when women don't earn equal pay for equal work,\" she said.</p> <p>It was appropriate that Bush and McCain should appear together at the Republican convention in Minneapolis-St Paul next week \"because these days they're awfully hard to tell apart\".</p> <p>Bill Clinton could prove to be less disciplined tomorrow evening. The Obama campaign team wanted to edit his speech to ensure he stuck to the theme of the day, national security.</p> <p>But Clinton, who feels Obama has failed to pay homage to the economic successes during his presidency, is intent on speaking about not only national security but the economy and his administration's achievements.</p> <p>In spite of her loyal speech, there is frustration in the Obama camp that she dominated one of only four precious convention days.</p> <p>Bill Clinton's speech and the prospect of a symbolic roll call of her supporters tomorrow will again overshadow Obama's message.</p>",
  "<p>I am honoured to be here tonight. A proud mother. A proud Democrat. A proud American. And a proud supporter of Barack Obama.</p> <p>My friends, it is time to take back the country we love.</p> <p>Whether you voted for me, or voted for Barack, the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose. We are on the same team, and none of us can sit on the sidelines.</p> <p>This is a fight for the future. And it's a fight we must win.</p> <p>I haven't spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children, campaigning for universal healthcare, helping parents balance work and family and fighting for women's rights at home and around the world ... to see another Republican in the White House squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people.</p> <p>And you haven't worked so hard over the last 18 months, or endured the last eight years, to suffer through more failed leadership.</p> <p>No way. No how. No McCain.</p> <p>Barack Obama is my candidate. And he must be our president.</p> <p>Tonight we need to remember what a presidential election is really about. When the polls have closed, and the ads are finally off the air, it comes down to you - the American people, your lives and your children's futures.</p> <p>For me, it's been a privilege to meet you in your homes, your workplaces, and your communities. Your stories reminded me every day that America's greatness is bound up in the lives of the American people - your hard work, your devotion to duty, your love for your children and your determination to keep going, often in the face of enormous obstacles.</p> <p>You taught me so much, you made me laugh, and ... you even made me cry. You allowed me to become part of your lives. And you became part of mine.</p> <p>I will always remember the single mom who had adopted two kids with autism, didn't have health insurance and discovered she had cancer. But she greeted me with her bald head painted with my name on it and asked me to fight for healthcare.</p> <p>I will always remember the young man in a Marine Corps t-shirt who waited months for medical care and said to me: \"Take care of my buddies; a lot of them are still over there \u2026 and then will you please help take care of me?\"</p> <p>I will always remember the boy who told me his mom worked for the minimum wage and that her employer had cut her hours. He said he just didn't know what his family was going to do.</p> <p>I will always be grateful to everyone from all 10 states, Puerto Rico and the territories, who joined our campaign on behalf of all those people left out and left behind by the Bush administration.</p> <p>To my supporters, my champions - my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits - from the bottom of my heart: thank you.</p> <p>You never gave in. You never gave up. And together we made history.</p> <p>Along the way, America lost two great Democratic champions who would have been here with us tonight. One of our finest young leaders, Arkansas Democratic Party chair, Bill Gwatney, who believed with all his heart that America and the south could be and should be Democratic from top to bottom.</p> <p>And congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones, a dear friend to many of us, a loving mother and courageous leader who never gave up her quest to make America fairer and smarter, stronger and better. Steadfast in her beliefs, a fighter of uncommon grace, she was an inspiration to me and to us all.</p> <p>Our heart goes out to Stephanie's son, Mervyn, Jr, and Bill's wife, Rebecca, who traveled to Denver to join us at our convention.</p> <p>Bill and Stephanie knew that after eight years of George Bush, people are hurting at home, and our standing has eroded around the world. We have a lot of work ahead.</p> <p>Jobs lost, houses gone, falling wages, rising prices. The supreme court in a right-wing headlock and our government in partisan gridlock. The biggest deficit in our nation's history. Money borrowed from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis.</p> <p>Putin and Georgia, Iraq and Iran.</p> <p>I ran for president to renew the promise of America. To rebuild the middle class and sustain the American dream, to provide the opportunity to work hard and have that work rewarded, to save for college, a home and retirement, to afford the gas and groceries and still have a little left over each month.</p> <p>To promote a clean energy economy that will create millions of green collar jobs.</p> <p>To create a healthcare system that is universal, high-quality and affordable so that parents no longer have to choose between care for themselves or their children or be stuck in dead end jobs simply to keep their insurance.</p> <p>To create a world-class education system and make college affordable again.</p> <p>To fight for an America defined by deep and meaningful equality - from civil rights to labour rights, from women's rights to gay rights, from ending discrimination to promoting unionisation to providing help for the most important job there is: caring for our families. To help every child live up to his or her God-given potential.</p> <p>To make America once again a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws.</p> <p>To bring fiscal sanity back to Washington and make our government an instrument of the public good, not of private plunder.</p> <p>To restore America's standing in the world, to end the war in Iraq, bring our troops home and honor their service by caring for our veterans.</p> <p>And to join with our allies to confront our shared challenges, from poverty and genocide to terrorism and global warming.</p> <p>Most of all, I ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years.</p> <p>Those are the reasons I ran for president. Those are the reasons I support Barack Obama. And those are the reasons you should too.</p> <p>I want you to ask yourselves: Were you in this campaign just for me? Or were you in it for that young Marine and others like him? Were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids? Were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage? Were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible?</p> <p>We need leaders once again who can tap into that special blend of American confidence and optimism that has enabled generations before us to meet our toughest challenges. Leaders who can help us show ourselves and the world that with our ingenuity, creativity and innovative spirit, there are no limits to what is possible in America.</p> <p>This won't be easy. Progress never is. But it will be impossible if we don't fight to put a Democrat in the White House.</p> <p>We need to elect Barack Obama because we need a president who understands that America can't compete in a global economy by padding the pockets of energy speculators, while ignoring the workers whose jobs have been shipped overseas. We need a president who understands that we can't solve the problems of global warming by giving windfall profits to the oil companies while ignoring opportunities to invest in new technologies that will build a green economy.</p> <p>We need a president who understands that the genius of America has always depended on the strength and vitality of the middle class.</p> <p>Barack Obama began his career fighting for workers displaced by the global economy. He built his campaign on a fundamental belief that change in this country must start from the ground up, not the top down. He knows government must be about \"we the people\" not \"we the favored few\".</p> <p>And when Barack Obama is in the White House, he'll revitalise our economy, defend the working people of America, and meet the global challenges of our time. Democrats know how to do this. As I recall, President Clinton and the Democrats did it before. And President Obama and the Democrats will do it again.</p> <p>He'll transform our energy agenda by creating millions of green jobs and building a new, clean energy future. He'll make sure that middle-class families get the tax relief they deserve. And I can't wait to watch Barack Obama sign a healthcare plan into law that covers every single American.</p> <p>Barack Obama will end the war in Iraq responsibly and bring our troops home - a first step to repairing our alliances around the world.</p> <p>And he will have with him a terrific partner in Michelle Obama. Anyone who saw Michelle's speech last night knows she will be a great first lady for America.</p> <p>Americans are also fortunate that Joe Biden will be at Barack Obama's side. He is a strong leader and a good man. He understands both the economic stresses here at home and the strategic challenges abroad. He is pragmatic, tough and wise. And, of course, Joe will be supported by his wonderful wife, Jill.</p> <p>They will be a great team for our country.</p> <p>Now, John McCain is my colleague and my friend.</p> <p>He has served our country with honor and courage.</p> <p>But we don't need four more years ... of the last eight years.</p> <p>More economic stagnation \u2026 and less affordable healthcare.</p> <p>More high gas prices \u2026 and less alternative energy.</p> <p>More jobs getting shipped overseas \u2026 and fewer jobs created here.</p> <p>More skyrocketing debt ... home foreclosures \u2026 and mounting bills that are crushing our middle-class families.</p> <p>More war ... less diplomacy.</p> <p>More of a government where the privileged come first \u2026 and everyone else comes last.</p> <p>John McCain says the economy is fundamentally sound. John McCain doesn't think that 47m people without health insurance is a crisis. John McCain wants to privatise Social Security. And in 2008, he still thinks it's okay when women don't earn equal pay for equal work.</p> <p>With an agenda like that, it makes sense that George Bush and John McCain will be together next week in the Twin Cities. Because these days they're awfully hard to tell apart.</p> <p>America is still around after 232 years because we have risen to the challenge of every new time, changing to be faithful to our values of equal opportunity for all and the common good.</p> <p>And I know what that can mean for every man, woman and child in America. I'm a United States senator because in 1848 a group of courageous women and a few brave men gathered in Seneca Falls, New York, many traveling for days and nights, to participate in the first convention on women's rights in our history.</p> <p>And so dawned a struggle for the right to vote that would last 72 years, handed down by mother to daughter to granddaughter - and a few sons and grandsons along the way.</p> <p>These women and men looked into their daughters' eyes, imagined a fairer and freer world, and found the strength to fight. To rally and picket. To endure ridicule and harassment. To brave violence and jail.</p> <p>And after so many decades - 88 years ago on this very day - the 19th amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote would be forever enshrined in our Constitution.</p> <p>My mother was born before women could vote. But in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president.</p> <p>This is the story of America. Of women and men who defy the odds and never give up.</p> <p>How do we give this country back to them?</p> <p>By following the example of a brave New Yorker , a woman who risked her life to shepherd slaves along the Underground Railroad.</p> <p>And on that path to freedom, Harriett Tubman had one piece of advice.</p> <p>If you hear the dogs, keep going.</p> <p>If you see the torches in the woods, keep going.</p> <p>If they're shouting after you, keep going.</p> <p>Don't ever stop. Keep going.</p> <p>If you want a taste of freedom, keep going.</p> <p>Even in the darkest of moments, ordinary Americans have found the faith to keep going.</p> <p>I've seen it in you. I've seen it in our teachers and firefighters, nurses and police officers, small business owners and union workers, the men and women of our military - you always keep going.</p> <p>We are Americans. We're not big on quitting.</p> <p>But remember, before we can keep going, we have to get going by electing Barack Obama president.</p> <p>We don't have a moment to lose or a vote to spare.</p> <p>Nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance.</p> <p>I want you to think about your children and grandchildren come election day. And think about the choices your parents and grandparents made that had such a big impact on your life and on the life of our nation.</p> <p>We've got to ensure that the choice we make in this election honours the sacrifices of all who came before us, and will fill the lives of our children with possibility and hope.</p> <p>That is our duty, to build that bright future, and to teach our children that in America there is no chasm too deep, no barrier too great - and no ceiling too high - for all who work hard, never back down, always keep going, have faith in God, in our country and in each other.</p> <p>Thank you so much. God bless America and Godspeed to you all.</p>",
  "<p>British parliamentarians have descended in droves on Denver to see what campaigning techniques developed by Barack Obama can be applied to their own parties.</p> <p>The Democratic convention has also attracted British trade unionists, lobbyists and representatives from a host of other groups.</p> <p>There is a long tradition of British parties adopting campaign techniques pioneered in the US. New Labour had a team attached to Bill Clinton's Little Rock campaign headquarters in Arkansas in 1992 and then applied lessons learned there to the UK.</p> <p>Conservative MPs, as well as Labour and the Liberal Democrats, have flown into Denver for the Democratic convention. </p> <p>Among the parliamentarians attending from Labour are David Lammy, MP for Tottenham; Mike Gapes, MP for Ilford South; and Hugh Bayley, MP for City of York.</p> <p>Bayley said: \"There is much more sophisticated use of new media by the Democrats. That is a lesson.\"</p> <p>He was also impressed by the way that Obama has used the internet to raise millions of dollars from small donors, diminishing the role of big donors. </p> <p>But he said that some of the techniques that have helped Obama win the Democratic nomination could not be applied across the Atlantic. There is a spending limit in Britain of about pounds 10,000 per constituency.</p> <p>He said he was not planning to attend the Republican convention next week. \"I have not been invited and if I was, it would not be to my taste,\" Bayley said.</p> <p>He added that the Labour party's future election prospects were dependent on its policies rather than any techniques imported from the US.</p> <p>Conservatives are attending both the Democratic convention and Republican one that begins next week in Minnesota. Among those at the Democratic convention are Francis Maude, a member of the shadow cabinet, and Simon Burns, MP for West Chelmsford.</p> <p>Although the Conservatives are a sister party of the Republicans and have a long relationship with the Republican candidate John McCain, the party leader David Cameron established a rapport with Obama during his visit to London in July. </p> <p>Steve Hilton, Cameron's strategist, flew into Denver on Tuesday.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats are represented by two former leaders, David Steel, who is in the Lords, and Sir Walter Menzies Campbell, MP for North East Fife.</p> <p>Campbell said: \"This is my seventh convention and it seems to me that the influence of money is enormous.\"</p> <p>He was impressed by the way that Obama had used small donors to fund his campaign. \"The lesson for Britain is get rid of the union support and (Lord) Ashcroft and get pounds 100 from each member of the public.\"</p> <p>Among the trade unionists are John Monks, the former leader of the TUC, and Charlie Whelan, Gordon Brown's former spin doctor.</p>",

There's no escaping the fact that Clinton's prime-time speech tonight will be, in part, an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/aug/26/hillaryclinton.clinton\">exercise in public therapy</a> for the failed presidential candidate and her staunchest supporters. They think, of course, that her speaking slot should have been on Thursday, accepting the nomination. Instead, the crucial question is whether she'll show sufficient enthusiasm for Obama to convey a message of party unity \u2014 and to bring back to the Democratic fold some of the 53% of Clinton supporters who aren't already solidly behind Obama. (The other question is whether she'll show that enthusiasm by deploying her ill-advised staring-and-pointing-at-someone-in-the-audience tactic.)</p> <p>On the streets of Denver today, the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/08/26/clinton.backers/\">angry hardline Pumas</a> have been marching. Those I spoke to last night, at an entirely surreal Republican-run 'Happy Hour for Hillary' in a gloomy bar, rejected the notion that she \"has to\" do anything in particular this evening: it's Obama's responsibility, they say, to unite the party. Inside the convention bubble, though, it's impossible to overstate how precisely the Clinton-Obama detente is being choreographed in an effort to make sure such sentiments don't get expressed. That will be nowhere more true than at tomorrow's roll-call vote, the precise orchestration of which will speak volumes. According to one version <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jQD-Ub1QQZgszKZ4ddpQBmVCevOQD92PVIIG3\">doing the rounds here</a>, the Obama and Clinton teams have agreed that Hillary herself will \"spontaneously\" step forward, mid-way through the voting, and urge that the nomination be awarded to Obama without completing the ballot. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Clintons' every move is being scrutinised: Hillary will attend Thursday's speech at Invesco Field, we're told; Bill <a href=\"http://blogs.marketwatch.com/election/2008/08/26/another-sneak-attack-by-bill-clinton/\">seemed to attack</a> Barack Obama once again in Denver today; then again, Hillary <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/08/clinton-if-we-d.html\">paid a compliment</a> to Michelle; on the other hand, Clinton's people <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/08/25/clinton_adviser_to_skip_town_b.html\">aren't even staying in town</a> for Obama's nomination acceptance speech. </p> <p>So, yes, tonight's speech is all about ego and emotion and therapy \u2014 but how Clinton handles it tonight could really matter, come November. \"Never before,\" <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/conventions/co_20080826_2298.php\">said</a> one Clinton supporter who'll be in the convention all tonight, \"has how the loser of the convention loses been more important than how the winner wins.\" Join me here in an hour or so (around <strong>8.15pm Denver time, 10.15pm eastern, 3.15am UK</strong> -- welcome, insomniacs!) and we'll pick over every last nuance.</p> <p><strong>8.05pm:</strong> (all times local) In response to commenter Lucerne, time for an important food update, and frankly I can't believe that while liveblogging last night I forgot to mention that I was \"enjoying\" a \"delicious\" snack of <a href=\"http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Breaded-Chicken-Fingers/Detail.aspx\">breaded chicken fingers</a> (which look way better in that linked picture). The food at the Pepsi Center all depends on who you are, and if you are me, it's burgers and hot dogs from a van like the ones I used to try to avoid as a student. But I'm not complaining. Much.</p> <p><strong>8.12pm:</strong> Last night, the convention organisers distributed Obama-branded \"Kennedy\" and \"Michelle\" banners; I'd been wondering if they'd go so far as to print \"Clinton\" ones. But I'm told the banners being handed out tonight will in fact say \"Clinton Voters For Obama\". </p> <p><strong>8.15pm:</strong> CNN reports that Clinton was consulting (of course!) <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/08/11/atlantic.clinton.staff/index.html\">Mark Penn</a> on the details of tonight's speech until as little as two hours ago. I know \u2014 why not use tonight's speech to <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/a/green-penn-3-19-07.mhtml\">accuse Obama of lacking American roots</a>? It'd certainly be unexpected...</p> <p><strong>8.20pm:</strong> Bill has arrived. He looks resplendent in his red tie and pink face.</p> <p><strong>8.28pm:</strong> ...And with minutes to go, the heavens have opened. It's pouring down. What can this signify? Meanwhile, Montana's governor, Britan Schweitzer, is giving a speech. He's wearing a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolo_tie\">bolo tie</a>. </p> <p><strong>8.37pm:</strong> Time for a Hillary Clinton tribute video, with a soundtrack by the Kinks, and some excruciating Saturday Night Live footage.</p> <p>Random thought: the last time I saw Hillary deliver a rousing call to support Barack Obama it was at her concession speech, at the National Buildings Museum, in Washington, and it was the best speech of her campaign. Then, though, she was urging her supporters to back Obama. Tonight, most of the people in the hall will already be enthusiastic backers of Obama. So won't it sound bizarre if she urges them to support him?</p> <p><strong>8.41pm</strong> Michael Tomasky, to my left, points out that there's now only 19 minutes until the traditional 9pm closing time of the convention. Surely she won't speak so briefly?</p> <p><strong>8.43pm</strong> Here's Chelsea, introducing Hillary, and here's Hillary. There <em>are</em> a whole lot of \"Hillary\" banners, it turns out. Clinton is wearing orange. She will be criticised for this. She's soaking up the applause, but she hasn't \"spotted-and-pointed-to\" anyone in the audience yet, as far as I can see. The whole top section of the massive plasma screens above the podium flash a single word: CLINTON.</p> <p><strong>8.48pm</strong> \"I'm here tonight as a proud mother, as a proud Democrat... and a proud supporter of Barack Obama.\" Wild cheers. \"It iss time to take back the country we love, and whether you voted for me or for Barack Obama, the time is right to unite as a single party with a single purpose.\" Couldn't be clearer than that. \"We are on the same team, and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines. This is a fight for the future, and it's a fight we must win together.\"</p> <p><strong>8.52pm</strong> A quick critique of McCain, though I don't expect we'll hear too much of that tonight \u2014 it'd be a distraction from the pro-Obama stuff, and Clinton might need to get along with McCain in the Senate (or with McCain as president) for some years. \"Barack Obama is my candidate. And he must be our president.\" That said, most of what we're hearing right now is Clinton self-glorification. \"I will always remember the single mom who had adopted two kids with autism, didn't have health insurance, and discovered she had cancer. But she greeted me with her bald head painted with my name on it and asked me to fight for healthcare.\" A ringing endorsement of Hillary Clinton, there, but her supporters will love it.</p> <p><strong>8.55pm</strong> Clinton thanks her \"sisterhood of the travelling pantsuits.\" OK. A New Zealand journalist is recording a radio report in my right ear. Very distracting. Meanwhile, tributes from Clinton to Bill Gwatney, the Arkansas Democratic party chair shot dead recently, and Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones, who also died.</p> <p>...By the way, Michelle Obama and Joe Biden are both watching and applauding vigorously. Barack's not in Denver yet, conveniently.</p> <p>A long section now about why Clinton ran for president. (Healthcare, education, a clean energy economy.) Still no Obama-love. Until now: \"... those are the reasons I ran for president, and those are the reasons I support Barack Obama for president. I want you to ask yourselves: were you in this campaign just for me? Or were you in it for that young Marine and others like him.\" (I didn't tell you about the young Marine \u2014 sorry.) Clinton does selflessness in a rather egotistical way, I guess, but this is good stuff.</p> <p><strong>8.58pm:</strong> The Tomasky judgment is in! \"It's fine,\" he says. \"It's probably going to get rave reviews. I don't like it very much, but it's probably going to get rave reviews. I've heard too many of her speeches.\"</p> <p><strong>9.00pm:</strong> \"When Barack Obama is in the White House, he'll revitalize our economy, defend the working people of America, and meet the global challenges of our time. Democrats know how to do this. As I recall, President Clinton and the Democrats did it before. And president Obama and the Democrats will do it again.\" Love for Michelle, for Joe Biden, and for Jill Biden. </p> <p><strong>9.03pm:</strong>\"Now, John McCain is my colleague and friend...\" \u2014 a silence in the hall \u2014 but no, it's OK, she's slagging him off aplenty now. He's complacent about healthcare, she says, \"and in 2008, he still thinks it's OK when women don't earn equal pay for equal work.\"</p> <p><strong>9.05pm:</strong> And <em>here's</em> the zinger! \"With an agenda like that, it makes sense that George Bush and John McCain will be together next week in the Twin Cities. Because these days they're awfully hard to tell apart.\" Fantastic line, and it's striking how little we've heard George Bush's name so far during this convention and the build-up to it. </p> <p><strong>9.08pm:</strong> A rousing section about Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad. \"If you hear the dogs, keep going. If you see torches in the woods, keep going. If they're shouting after you, keep going. Don't ever stop. Keep going... but remember, before we can keep going, we have to get going by electing Barack Obama president.\"</p> <p><strong>9.10pm:</strong> And it's over, with a big final pro-Obama rallying cry. I'll be very surprised if this speech doesn't get wildly enthusiastic reviews tomorrow, but first I'm going to (try to) mingle with some of the delegates and see if I can reach any Significant Conclusions.</p> <p><strong>9.30pm:</strong> James Carville, on CNN, can't resist pointing out that \"this is what a major league fastballer sounds like.\"</p> <p><strong>9.40pm:</strong>Well, that's one elated crowd, Overheard:</p> <p>\"She stepped up to the moment. She stepped up.\"<br>\"She did everything she could have done.\"<br>\"These people -- they have HEALED!\" \u2014 actually that was the Daily Show's John Oliver, recording a piece to camera.</p> <p>Diane Wood, a Kentucky delegate and Hillary supporter turned Obama backer, told me Hillary \"said exactly what needed to be said. I think people are really united here. I guess there'll be some holdouts, but I don't think there are any in my delegation \u2014 not that I know of, anyway.\"</p> <p>My colleague Elana Schor is questioning the crowd in a rather less hasty fashion \u2014 read it later <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections\">here</a>!</p> <p><strong>9.45pm:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.reason.com/convention2008/show/128315.html\">Hit and Run</a> has a quick roundup of medialand opinions on the speech. They're all positive.</p> <p>(...As someone will inevitably point out tomorrow, a lot of Hillary Clinton's enthusiasm for Barack Obama \u2014 like that of many of her supporters in the hall \u2014 almost certainly isn't \"genuine\"; nobody believes that she and Bill sit around the dinner table raving endlessly about the man who beat her to the nomination. Sure. But I never understand why that's considered a criticism. Saying what Clinton said tonight, for the sake of electing a Democrat, is surely principled politics, isn't it? Even if it took her many months to start saying it, and even if plenty of tonight's speech was Clinton-focused. What tonight's speech emphatically wasn't was an exercise in helping her supporters wallow in resentment, which she's been all too prone to doing in the fairly recent past. \"I want you to ask yourselves: Were you in this campaign just for me?\" \u2014 that's not public therapy, that's a rejection of any further public therapy...)</p> <p><strong>9.50pm:</strong> Oh, and look who's just issued a statement \u2014 the McCain campaign. They're pointing out that Clinton's enthusiasm for Obama is questionable because of all the times she attacked him. See paragraph above.</p> <p><strong>9.58pm:</strong> That's all from me. I'm going to step out into the streets of Denver and breathe in the sweet, clear scent of UNITY.

  "<p><em>Hugh Jackson is reporting from Denver for the Nevada political blog <a href=\"http://www.lasvegasgleaner.com/\">Las Vegas Gleaner</a></em></p> <p>Gambling, drinking, prostitution - sure, at first blush it looks like Nevada is something special.</p> <p>But beneath that respectable veneer of reckless behaviour and general carrying on, the state is actually not unlike the rest of America. People work hard, love their kids, and struggle to get by and keep up.</p> <p>And just like Democratic leaders the nation over, Nevadans at the Democratic National Convention in Denver are contending - and hoping - that the swath Hillary Clinton and her former president of a husband have cut through the convention is not going to compromise Barack Obama's chances of winning the presidency.</p> <p>Clinton <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21229219/\">won Nevada's caucus</a> - the third contest in the country following Iowa and New Hampshire - in January (although in a reflection of Byzantine caucus rules, Obama won more delegates). Her campaign chairman in the state was Rory Reid, a Clark County (Las Vegas) commissioner whose father, <a href=\"http://reid.senate.gov/\">US Senate majority leader Harry Reid</a>, was officially neutral in the presidential contest until it had been decided in June.</p> <p>Rory son of Harry, now fully behind Obama, is quick to play down reports of Clinton family reluctance to embrace the nominee. And he dismisses the suggestion that by looming over the first days of the convention and her decision to put her name in nomination in pursuit of \"catharsis,\" Clinton threw the convention off its main message: introducing Barack Obama.</p> <p>What Clinton termed a catharsis, Reid the Younger described as \"just procedural motions that are relevant to nobody but a few people who are interested in process.\"</p> <p>A Nevada Obama champion is also keen to play down stories suggesting that the Clintons are less than wildly enthusiastic about Obama's nomination. \"I don't know how much of that is really the Clintons and how much is media spin,\" said Barbara Buckley, the first woman to become the speaker of the lower house in the state Legislature.</p> <p>But Buckley hoped Clinton's address on Tuesday would \"put all the chatter to rest.\" Well, Madame Speaker, one can hope.</p> <p>Nevada will be a true battleground state in November. Thanks to its large Latino population and strong union presence, Nevada was thought to be a microcosm of key portions of the Democratic party nationwide. That's why it was selected to play an early role in the nominating process.</p> <p>If Nevada is at all a reflection of Democrats nationwide, it is possible that latent Clinton passions among the electorate are being overstated by the political-media-industrial complex. While Clinton enjoys strong support within the Nevada delegation and among Democrats statewide, Nevadans at the Denver convention insist that they are all firmly behind Obama and will work for his election.</p> <p>As Congresswoman Shelley Berkley, an ardent Clinton supporter, put it: \"There's too much at stake.\"</p> <p>At the same time, the convention is carefully stage-crafted - in theory, anyway - not only to inspire the party faithful but also to introduce and sing the praises of Barack Obama to the all-important independent and swing voters nationwide. And yet much of the convention's first couple days were consumed with All Things Clinton instead of All Obama All the Time.</p> <p>And when the Republicans meet at their convention in St. Paul next week, ostensibly to officially nominate John McCain but primarily to mount concerted, methodical and relentless attacks designed to destroy the public image of Barack Obama, they won't be so easily distracted.</p>",

Turns out liberals are so naturally accommodating that they're allowing Rudy, Mitt Romney, and other senior figures from the forthcoming McCain administration blast them with criticism on their own territory \u2014 a big step up from the rather poignant warehouse on a parking lot that the Republicans have rented as their Denver headquarters. However, the President of 9/11 will be made to leave the venue prior to Hillary Clinton's big speech tonight, otherwise he's liable to start <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0890427/plotsummary\">humming</a>, quietly at first, and then louder and louder, until no-one can hear what Clinton is saying, because that's the kind of thing he does.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/27/uselections2008.rudygiuliani#start-of-comments\">Comment</a><br></p>"
