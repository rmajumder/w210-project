  "<p>I have a short attention span, so short I even got bored just then, halfway through typing the word \"span\". This means when planning a holiday, I tend to balk at the prospect of a week or two flopping on a beach. What if I get restless and walk into the sea? More to the point, and going on past experience, what if I get so sunburned on day one I spend the rest of the holiday staggering around like someone who's just crawled their way clear of a nuclear blast? There's only so many times you can say \"ouch\" before you get tired of hearing yourself wince.</p> <p>That's why my ideal holiday is a road trip. All that variety! And sitting down! It's like watching television, but better, because every so often you get to step out into the landscape you're watching and interact with it. And it's in 3D! Perfect.</p> <p>Apart from one tiny problem. I can't drive. I've done road trips before - in the US, obviously, because that's the Kingdom of Road Trips - and each time, I've had to recruit/con (delete where applicable) licence-holding friends or girlfriends into coming. Since the ideal trip lasts around three weeks, and has a cast of more than two, arranging the details isn't always easy, particularly when you try to do it at short notice. I don't know many people prepared to drop everything to spend the best part of a month driving from state to state. Although it turns out I do know one: my improbable friend Aisleyne, tabloid staple and former Big Brother contestant. She, preposterous as it sounds, would be my rock, my \"core driver\", for the duration of the trip. Others would accompany us for different sections: for the first leg, through California, my friend Urmee and an ex, Cat. For the second half, two other friends: Kelly and Ben, who'd fly out to meet us when we got to Las Vegas.</p> <p>The whole thing was organised in a blur. It was only when I got to the airport that it struck me: none of these people knew each other. Most of them had never met. And they were a fairly diverse bunch. This was like throwing a bizarre mobile birthday party.</p> <p>But I wasn't worried about that. I was worried about the flight. I'm not a good flier. I don't flip out on board and start hammering at the exits; I just sit there nervily envisaging a death plunge for the duration of the journey. And in the days leading up to take-off, I feel doomy and bleak, like I'm on a self-imposed death row. But this time around I had some valium. I'd never taken it before, and I'm glad I did. Neck the pill and 20 minutes later: bingo. Suddenly nothing really mattered. Instead of gripping the armrest during take-off, I lay back in my seat exhibiting the sort of blissful insouciance you'd normally associate with a man who's just been tossed off in a massage parlour.</p> <p>We arrived in San Francisco and picked up our car: an unsexy people carrier the size and shape of an industrial refrigerator. A sports convertible may sound fun, but just try driving through the desert in one: within the hour you'd be hallucinating with sunstroke so badly, you'd swerve off the road, thinking you were traversing the rings of Saturn or driving inside Joan Collins's face.</p> <p>Still, there was no driving at all for the first two days. There's scarcely any point taking a car into San Francisco: it's a collection of steep hills with no parking spaces. We explored on foot. The first day was spent aimlessly wandering around in a kind of daze as we tried to acclimatise. San Francisco is the US equivalent of Brighton. It's quaint, it's a gay mecca, it's by the sea, and it's foggy and cold.</p> <p>I'd taken the precaution of pre-booking tickets for a night tour of Alcatraz (piece of piss: you buy them online and print the tickets yourself). It's essential to book in advance, and well worth the effort, if only for the bit on the tour where you stand in a solitary confinement cell listening to a former inmate explain how he kept himself sane in the dark by ripping a button off his shirt, throwing it in the air and spending the rest of the night searching for it on his hands and knees. If you enjoy harrowing glimpses into the dark heart of man's inhumanity to man, you'll have a whale of a time. I certainly did.</p> <p>The next day we wandered around Haight-Ashbury. Once the birthplace of the hippy movement, it's now a sort of cross between Shoreditch and Camden: all trendy shops and organic cafes. Since I was accompanied by girls, I spent most of my time standing impatiently in clothes stores, listening to them coo over assorted pieces of fabric.</p> <p>Still, at least I got to eat a gigantic burrito, which, as it turned out, would be my biggest meal of the entire trip. Women don't eat really, do they? At least, this lot didn't. All they wanted, every night, was sushi. Sushi, sushi, sushi. Before you accuse them and me of insufferable wankery, bear in mind that sushi in the States is far cheaper and better than in Britain. By the end of the trip I'd inhaled more fish than a sperm whale, but at least I hadn't clogged my colon with 10,000 burgers and steaks.</p> <p>Then we got in the car and headed out. First stop: Santa Cruz. Satnav has transformed road trips, skimming hours from your journey time - not so much on the open road, but on the fiddly bits when you're looking for a motel. Get an address in advance and you arrive effortlessly, auto-piloted all the way to their front door.</p> <p>I've been to Santa Cruz before. That time it was great: a sun-drenched, laid-back surfer's town with an old-fashioned beachfront fairground complete with wooden rollercoaster. This time it was overcast and all the girls had PMS, so we didn't hang around. The next morning we stopped in Monterey, checked out its superb aquarium (which features a mind-mangling display of artificially lit jellyfish, hovering in space like tiny galaxies), and decided to tackle the drive down Big Sur at sunset.</p> <p>Big Sur is, as any guidebook will tell you, spectacular: all winding roads, cliffs, sheer drops, and the ocean. Being a media-saturated ponce, however, I couldn't quite shake the feeling that I was in an upscale car commercial, albeit a gloriously beautiful one. Television spoils everything.</p> <p>Then it got dark. Big Sur takes longer than you think, and driving around the side of cliffs in the dark is Not Fun. There was, it's fair to say, a certain amount of screaming, especially when a spooky guy in a knackered van insisted on tailing us for a full hour. He was definitely a murderer. Definitely.</p> <p>Eventually we made it to San Luis Obispo, to stay in the apparently notorious Madonna Inn: part-motel, part design nightmare. No corner of the Earth could be more gaudy. We sat at the bar. It resembled archive footage of 60s Vegas playing on a TV with the colour cranked up to hallucinogenic levels. Every surface was Pepto-Bismol pink or electric blue. A terrifying giant doll hung overhead, lolling back and forth on a mechanical swing. This is what serial killers see in their heads when they come. I recommend it wholeheartedly.</p> <p>The next day, still rubbing our eyes, we made for Santa Barbara, a relaxing boutique of a town, clean to the point of artificial, with miles of beach. It's what you imagine California is like in your head when you're 12. Accommodation isn't cheap, but it's the perfect place to unwind - particularly if you enjoy sunbathing, which I don't. Disturbing sight of the day: a bikini-clad Paris Hilton-style beach bunny sitting on a towel with the words \"WHITE PRIDE\" tattooed in gothic script across her lower back. Aisleyne had to be talked out of walking over and lamping her.</p> <p>Next stop: Los Angeles. Sadly, the hotel we'd booked turned out to be a) next to the airport, b) a 40-minute drive from anywhere interesting, and c) a self-consciously trendy hangout apparently designed to personally annoy me. The lifts played canned laughter when you arrived at your floor. That's not a metaphor: that's what they actually did. And the mini-bar didn't include cold drinks, but did have a packet of radish seeds and one of those little table-tennis bats with a rubber ball hanging off a bit of elastic. Q: What's the difference between quirky irony and infuriating \"You Don't Have to Be Mad to Work Here But it Helps!\" wackiness? A: None.</p> <p>Sadly, I had work to do in LA. Not high-powered meetings with movie execs. No. Just my usual Guardian writing duties. So I had to sit in the hotel room, tapping at a laptop, while the girls went off and swanned around. At one point I had a break and took a cab to an outdoor mall. Sinatra was being piped in from invisible speakers somewhere in the trees, and everyone was far slimmer than the last time I was here. Suddenly I felt like scum. It made me want to smoke. I quit smoking in February, and now the sheer Tupperware mock-pleasantness of everything surrounding me was threatening to undo my resolve. I bought a pack, lit one, and immediately extinguished it. No. No.</p> <p>I was happy to leave LA. I was less happy with Cat's driving. We were heading for Vegas, and she appeared to be in a hurry. Perhaps she'd robbed a bank while I wasn't looking. Either way, she was hell-bent on squeezing a four-hour drive into 10 minutes. But when you can't drive, you're robbed of the ability to complain. Instead I distracted myself by selecting our driving soundtrack from an MP3 player. At least that way I'd be able to listen to the Beatles while the fire crew cut us from the wreckage.</p> <p>Fortunately it didn't come to that and we arrived in one piece. Then things instantly turned strange. Knowing I was going to be staying in Vegas, the Guardian had sent out feelers to see if anyone was prepared to offer free, interesting accommodation to one of its writers. I'd get a nice place to stay, they'd get some publicity (good or bad, it's all publicity). That's how it works.</p> <p>The Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino said yes. And because I would be covering it for this piece, they pulled out all the stops. I wasn't quite prepared for what happened. First, we were introduced to our own personal butler, the instantly charming Bisrat. He took us to our suite, which turned out to comprise four huge individual rooms branching off a massive lounge the size of a fashionable London bar. It had a pool table, a bar, a table football machine, a plasma screen on every available surface, some wacky sculptures, a breathtaking view of the strip, and - right there in the lounge - a free-standing shower with a lap-dancing pole in the middle of it. </p> <p>Bisrat immediately uncorked a bottle of wine and poured us each a glass. I needed it. Drop me in the middle of opulence like this and I automatically feel like a burglar.</p> <p>No matter how often I looked round the place, I couldn't get used to it. It looked like a set. You could film an entire aspirational drama series about hard-partying city hotshots in there, if you were an arsehole. Suddenly I wondered: what appalling scenes has this place witnessed in the past? How many hookers have twirled round that pole? Did housekeeping routinely wipe it clean each morning? Brrr.</p> <p>Urmee and Cat flew home. Kelly flew in, followed shortly by Ben. I was talked, somehow, into going to a club. It was called Tryst, and was situated in the middle of the Wynn casino, a horrible slab of money and pretension designed to appeal squarely to absolute wankers. The club was rammed with beautiful women and hideous men. It had a waterfall, expensive drinks, and a dancefloor full of whooping twats throwing banknotes in the air. Good, I thought. The economy is tanking. This looks like the last days of Rome. Then another thought struck me: here I was, with two improbably glamorous women, in Vegas. Everyone thought I'd paid for them. Because that makes sense in Vegas.</p> <p>Furthermore, going round Vegas with these two was like escorting two female models through a prison. The foul, hollow, forced party vibe I found bleakly amusing on previous trips now felt sickly and threatening. It's like a permanent New Year's Eve, my worst night of the year. Everyone pretending to let go and enjoy themselves. All of it fake, as fake as the replica Eiffel tower dominating Paris, the fake French casino. It's an atmosphere in which idiots thrive. The next day, by the pool, I saw a trio of muscled-up body-fascist lunkheads loudly haranguing an out-of-shape middle-aged man with lots of body hair. \"Hey dude, you're totally rocking that mohair sweater,\" they yelled, again and again. They stood right over him. \"Seriously, it's awesome.\" They said it over and over, until he left. Shamefully, I did nothing. They'd have killed me.</p> <p>A few hours later, a drunk buffoon swiped Aisleyne's camera and took photos of his own spectacularly ugly testicles in a doomed bid to impress the ladies. The perfect metaphor for Vegas.</p> <p>Back in the suite, while the Bellagio casino's multi-million dollar fountain display erupted across the road, every plasma screen was filled with Obama and McCain and red flashing numbers and ECONOMY IN CRISIS. Las Vegas is mad at the best of times. In this context, it seemed downright insane. The trend in recent years has been for swankier and swankier casinos: the Bellagio and the Wynn are essentially Dynasty box sets made flesh. Now the credit crunch has left them looking like big, dumb relics. Towering, empty hangovers. They felt underpopulated compared to the downmarket tack-pits which, comparatively, were overflowing. If gloomy economic predictions are correct, Vegas is going to turn very ugly very quickly.</p> <p>Not that I spent the whole time scowling. After all, I was in the lap of luxury. The food, the service, the furnishings - it was all one unending blowjob. But it felt like a blowjob taking place seconds before a mushroom cloud appears on the horizon. Stupidly - incredibly stupidly - I started smoking, seduced by the novelty of being able to light up indoors, which felt as exotic as smoking underwater. Argh. By the time you read this, I'll be in the process of my umpteenth 72-hour quitting process. Thanks, Vegas. Once again, I was glad to leave.</p> <p>By now we were behind on our itinerary. The next few days consisted of near non-stop driving. Another rule of road trips: allow far more time than you think you'll need. We sprinted through Monument Valley. Amazing landscape, yes: but when you're in a hurry it's essentially just another load of rocks. Then a mammoth drive all the way to Albuquerque.</p> <p>If you find yourself anywhere near Albuquerque, go on the Sandia Peak aerial tramway. Just do it. It's the longest mountain cable car in the world, and it's terrifying and beautiful at once. Half your brain is lulled by the scenery, while the other half screams about death. There's a bar at the top. I drank a pint with shaking hands.</p> <p>After Albuquerque, we stopped in a charming town called Truth or Consequences, named after a 1950s radio show that offered to broadcast an episode from the first town prepared to change its name to that of the show. Before that it was called Hot Springs, and with good reason. Because it's full of hot springs. Most of the motels double as spas. Go there. It's bloody lovely.</p> <p>Between Truth or Consequences and the hill country of Texas, there wasn't much to do but drive, drive, drive, with the occasional overnight stop in a shithole. Thank God we were getting on, because it's a bit like being stuck in a small air-conditioned cell, albeit one with an interesting view out the window. The sheer amount of space in America can become overwhelming: the road is straight, and it stretches all the way to the horizon, forever.</p> <p>Finally we made it to Bandera, Texas, for a two-day stay at the Running-R Guest Ranch. This was possibly the best part of the entire trip, and certainly the most relaxing. Stay in a cabin! Fall asleep in a rocking chair! Ride a horse! I've never ridden a horse before: fortunately, they're prepared for greenhorns. You just climb on its back and it follows the other horses, like a software-driven electronic car. I kept forgetting it was a real animal, except every so often it'd stop for a piss or stumble a bit on a rock. That wakes you up. All the staff were impossibly friendly: Kelly and Aisleyne were particularly taken with one of our cowgirl hosts, whose life they envied so hard it almost hurt them.</p> <p>Our final destination was Houston, of which I saw little more than a soulless shopping mall, some skyscrapers and a thunderstorm. Oh, and a pair of swans, improbably bobbing around in a pool in the hotel lobby. Houston doubtless has far more to offer, but I didn't have time to see it. I had to fly home.</p> <p>In summary: not a relaxing holiday, but an insanely eventful one. We tried to cram too much in to the time we had, which is why both the trip itself and this article were full of fleeting snapshots. For the distance we travelled (SF to LA to Vegas to Houston) I'd allow at least an extra week. Otherwise you spend a bit too much time rubbernecking and fiddling with iPods in the passenger seat. Nonetheless, the US is undoubtedly a great place to visit. Friendly people, stunning scenery, and if you pick your motels wisely, it's cheap, too.

  "<h2>Is the Sarah Palin coverage in the media sexist?</h2> <p>An objective measure of bias in this case isn't hard to find: let's compare the treatment of Palin to that of Hillary Clinton during her presidential run against Barack Obama. Both women were subjected to critiques that would not have been levelled at their male counterparts - think this week's row over Palin's $150,000 (\u00a395,000) clothes budget and the bizarre scrutiny of Clinton's cleavage in the US last year.</p> <p>But while US TV pundits slammed Clinton as \"witchy\" and wondered if she were \"pimping out\" her daughter for voters, Palin's own political party was handing out campaign buttons depicting her as \"the hottest governor from the coldest state\". When Palin tossed a wink at the camera during the vice-presidential debate, Republican scribe Rich Lowry sighed that he \"sat up a little straighter on the couch and said, 'hey, I think she just winked at me'.\" </p> <p>It's tough to deem Palin a victim of media sexism when no small part of the fixation on her looks came from the Republican camp. In addition, McCain aides muddied the waters by claiming that any inquiry into her past was sexist.</p> <p>The biggest test of media attitudes toward Palin came via the debate over her pricey outfits, purchased by Republicans eager to present a polished image of their new star. While mainstream fashion editors offered catty assessments of her shoe choices, one of Palin's strongest defenders also came from the media. \"Women are judged based on their appearance far, far more than men,\" CNN presenter Campbell Brown told viewers on Wednesday. \"All women in the public eye deal with this.\"</p> <p>But let's ask Palin herself whether reporters have shown gender bias against her. Palin, 44, who once accused Clinton of \"whining\" about sexism, said earlier this month: \"It would be sexist if the media were to hold back and not ask me about my experience, my vision.\" </p> <p>After the damaging shopping scandal erupted, however, she began likening the media's treatment of her to none other than Hillary Clinton.<br><strong>Elana Schor</strong></p> <h2>Does celebrity status make you ill?</h2> <p>Kerry Katona's \"erratic behaviour\" on ITV1's This Morning this week raises this question once again. In my opinion, celebrity status is highly likely to make its recipient ill. Although fledgling celebrities won't necessarily show symptoms straight away, it doesn't take long before they start to suffer.</p> <p>Why is this? How can it be that what appears so desirable is actually so deleterious? This is the case for two reasons - the sudden unnecessary wealth and the constant scrutiny that accompany celebrity status.</p> <p>Human beings are group animals. Alone, we cannot meet all our needs. That's why it feels so good to give - we're neurochemically reinforced for sharing. However, when one individual is suddenly given far more than she needs, her initial reaction is usually emotional and immature. She becomes greedy. It takes time, and mature reflection, to realise that giving is more fun. And very few celebrities are given the opportunity for any calm reflection at all, let alone enough to figure this out. JK Rowling and Bill Gates come to mind, but few others.</p> <p>The reason there's no chance to reflect is because of the second factor, the constant scrutiny. Physicists have shown that even a \"mindless\" particle is affected if it's observed by one pair of eyes - think of the effect of millions of pairs of eyes on one poor celebrity! This new experience causes its victim to feel vaguely out of control, so she looks to \"cure\" herself using her wealth. Most of the \"cures\" carry their own dangers, thus compounding her problems.</p> <p>However, it's oversimplifying to say that celebrity status \"causes\" illness. It would be better to say that celebrity status brings out inherent weaknesses and makes an individual more vulnerable to illness - in particular, mental illness. My advice, therefore, if you detect an opportunity for stardom, is to run away from it - as fast as you can. <br><strong>Linda Blair</strong></p> <h2>Are pints the wrong size?</h2> <p>The pub trade in Britain is famously conservative and beer drinkers love tradition. So the notion of a new two-thirds of a pint measure prompted laughter, scorn and cries of \"Southern Jessie Plot\" yesterday at the Jug and Barrel in Stanningley, Leeds.</p> <p>\"No, no, no, no!\" cried out truck driver Richard Lee over his pint of locally-brewed bitter. \"We don't want less beer. We want more.\"</p> <p>The aim of the proposal, in a consultation paper from the National Weights and Measures Laboratory, is to offer more choice to consumers. Innocuous; but to win over public-bar drinkers, it might be wiser to start with a larger new measure. </p> <p>\"Why not a pint-and-a-half?\" asked other regulars. Or a litre (except the latter triggers growls about continental ways). But wouldn't 36-year-old Lee's women friends go for something a bit less hefty than a pint, but not as little-girly, lager-and-limey as a half?</p> <p>\"No. Yorkshirewomen drink pints,\" he said firmly. The barmaid agreed and couldn't see anyone wanting to get into complications such as thirds. The only dissent came from Barrie Pepper, author of a series of guides to pubs in Yorkshire and an occasional drinker at the pub. </p> <p>\"We shouldn't be scared of a bit of innovation,\" said Pepper. \"I found third-of-a-pints very useful when they introduced them at the Leeds beer festival last year. It's a good quantity if you're sampling a range of different beers.\" </p> <p>Lee conceded that two-thirds glasses might make inroads in London, and Pepper noted a possible similarity with limited attempts to bring in half-litre measures a decade ago. \"The idea there was to try to keep the price of a glass of beer below \u00a31,\" he said. \"For the breweries in hard times, a two-thirds measure might have the same appeal.\"<br><strong>Martin Wainwright</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Send us your questions about the week's news by midday every Friday and our experts will answer them in Saturday's Guardian.

  "<p>Israel moved closer to an early general election yesterday when an<br>ultra-Orthodox party refused to join a coalition that the prime minister-designate, Tzipi Livni, has spent weeks trying to form.</p> <p>The decision by Shas, a rightwing party representing religious Jews from non-European backgrounds, means that Livni faces the prospect of forming a coalition with a slim majority, or failing outright, which means elections would follow early next year.</p> <p>Livni said a final decision would be reached by tomorrow.</p> <p>Livni, the current foreign minister, narrowly won the leadership of the ruling party, Kadima, in an internal vote last month. She then had six weeks to form a coalition with at least 61 votes in the 120-seat Knesset. She already had the support of the Labour party, giving her a total of 48 seats, and could expect the support of at least one other small party, but still hoped for Shas's 12 seats.</p> <p>The negotiations with Shas were difficult from the start. The party made two key demands: an increase in child allowances and a promise that in any peace negotiations Israel would not agree to divide Jerusalem. Livni offered less money for the allowances, but proposed to extend the jurisdiction of rabbinical courts. However, the party's spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, decided to pull out of the talks.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain's closest advisers claimed yesterday that he is still capable of winning the presidency in spite of low morale inside his headquarters and infighting over who is to blame for the campaign debacle.</p> <p>With 10 days left to election day, McCain's team is desperately looking for a tightening of the polls, which yesterday showed Barack Obama extending his lead in the battleground states.</p> <p>The chances of a turnaround were not helped by the huge falls on Wall Street and stock markets round the world. McCain had been in a near dead heat with Obama until the Wall Street meltdown last month.</p> <p>Steve Schmidt, McCain's chief strategist, briefing reporters, admitted there was ground to make up but said the campaign team believed it was possible. He drew parallels with other presidential candidates who had come from far behind in the final week.</p> <p>But another aide, who asked for anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the press, acknowledged that there was tension inside the McCain camp, without going into detail. </p> <p>Staff at his headquarters, in Arlington, Virginia, are already speaking about his campaign in the past tense and some, with hopes of a White House job diminishing, have sent out job resumes.</p> <p>Mark McKinnon, who had been a key member of McCain's team during the nomination battles but then left, told the Politico website: \"If you really want to see what 'going negative' is in politics, just watch the back-stabbing and blame game that we're starting to see.\"</p> <p>His team is bracing itself for an 8,200-word article in tomorrow's New York Times magazine about the McCain inner circle, based on interviews with half-a-dozen top advisers. Arguments within the camp range from the message to be pursued in the final stretch to whether it was a blunder to appoint Sarah Palin as his running-mate.</p> <p>The recriminations over Palin will not be helped by the resurgence of the Troopergate scandal, in which she has been found to have abused her power.

  "<p>Joel Haugen, a Republican fighting a tough congressional race against the Democrats in Oregon, has fallen out with his party.

He won 70% of the nomination vote.</p> <p>The Republican party became increasingly \"unfriendly\", Tiedemann said, and has withdrawn all financial support.</p> <p>Haugen, as a compromise, is now standing under an independent banner, though he remains a registered Republican. Tiedemann said the reaction among Republicans over his endorsement was mixed. She acknowledged it was \"unusual\" to make such an endorsement but Haugen \"feels the Republican party has got so far from its roots\".</p> <p>Other defectors include Arne Carlson, Republican governor of Minnesota from 1991-1999, who wrote in the Minneapolis Star-Tribune on Thursday: \"The choice of Governor Sarah Palin as a running mate, and the resultant shallow campaign based on fear and suspicion, looks frighteningly similar to the politics of Karl Rove [Bush's campaign strategist].\" He described Obama as having \"the potential to become a truly great president\".</p> <p>McClellan. who published a book this year critical of the Bush administration, accusing it of lying, told CNN he would vote for Obama because he offered the best chance of changing the way Washington works.</p>",

  "<p>Reading your front page recounting increasing endorsements and money for Barack Obama (Obama's perfect weekend: Ahead in polls, record fundraising - and Colin Powell too, October 20) might lead the reader to think that the Democratic candidate is closing in more and more on the presidency.</p> <p>But despite all the endorsements and money, Obama's lead has really not changed significantly over the last few months. And that lead is not big enough to offset either the last-minute effect of repugnant Republican distortions and the race vote. These two effects could still lead to John McCain getting elected.</p> <p>I am not just arguing from statistics. I am an American who has lived in and around the south for much of my life, and I do not underestimate the deep-seated resentments of racism, and their consequences for election-day turnout.</p> <p>This election campaign has turned into a battle for America's soul, and on election day I may be hoping for the best but will be expecting the worst.<br><strong>Thomas Crowley</strong><br>East Linton, East Lothian </p> <p>In today's political climate it is refreshing to encounter a politician strong enough to speak their mind and stand up for what they believe, even if this means stepping away from the party line (In praise of...

Partisan officials processing these forms can then cause problems for potential voters of the \"wrong\" party - I had to appeal to the local official's superiors, and it took me three months to register.

Presumably their names will be on the ballot papers, so it might be encouraging for us Europeans, and even the Americans, to know that you are allowed to have other viewpoints in the US - even if you don't have billions of dollars falling from your back pocket.

  "<p>At a time when a crisis is unfolding that will deflate American power irreversibly, the next US administration could be elected on the back of voters for whom denying women abortion choice and promoting creationism in schools are more important than the state of the world at large. To be sure, the financial crisis may allow American voters to overcome the drag of racism and elect Obama, despite his obvious intellectual superiority. But whatever the outcome, the leadership of the world's largest liberal democracy is not going to be decided by anything like rational argument, or by concern for problems that lie beyond America's shores.</p> <p>The upcoming American election kept coming to mind as I read Chris Patten's What Next?. In many ways this is an extremely impressive book. It is a very long time since a leading British politician produced anything so ambitious, or as well written. The subject is nothing less than the global condition at the start of this century. Nuclear proliferation, global warming, oil production and the energy crisis, world poverty and the \"bottom billion\", the illegal drugs trade, immigration and human trafficking and the spread of epidemic diseases are all examined, with asides on Russia, China and practically every important development in world history since the Renaissance. </p> <p>Patten is rightly scornful of some aspects of current political discourse: \"You do not need to be a grammarian,\" he writes, \"to know that you do not fight wars against common nouns but against personal ones. You fight a war against this or that country or enemy. Wars on drugs, wars on poverty, wars on waste - all these things are idle if grandiose ways of describing doomed political ventures.\" It is a crucial point, elegantly stated. But whoever wins the presidential election, the next administration is sure to want to ramp up America's bungling \"war on terror\", most likely by taking the failed Afghan campaign into Pakistan. Maybe the war on terror will simply implode, along with the American financial system. Certainly, the vast levels of military </p> <p>expenditure of the past 20 years cannot be sustained. But it is hard to see the US, which alone among the countries engaged in Afghanistan still believes the war can be won, quietly departing the scene. A political solution is nowhere on the agenda. Even Obama has urged that US forces hunt down the Taliban by following them into Pakistan. If this happens America will have mired itself and the world in another intractable conflict, this time in an increasingly unstable state that is also nuclear.</p> <p>Throughout his conspectus of global issues Patten is supremely confident that he knows what needs to be done. Despite occasional swipes at recent policies, What Next? is conventional wisdom of the most elevated kind and, like all versions of the genre, it avoids unmentionable realities. For example, while he discusses population growth in passing on several occasions - mostly in conjunction with a dismissive reference to Thomas Malthus - Patten at no point confronts the vast problems posed by the fact that human numbers will rise by around another 50% over the next half-century. Informing the reader that in the second millennium \"the world's population increased 22-fold, while global domestic product went up 13 times as fast,\" he shows no hint of doubt that, as long as globalisation continues, this trend will also continue. </p> <p>In failing to consider the possibility that there may be a human population problem Patten has plenty of company. He is at one with Marx, Hayek, Mao, the Pope, the Bush administration and many development economists. But is this near-universal denial of natural limits on human expansion well-founded? Or is it no more than a silly orthodoxy, like the faith of an earlier generation of bien pensants that central planning would create an economy of abundance?</p> <p>An integral part of conventional wisdom is the conviction that all reasonable people subscribe to it, and this faith lies at the heart of Patten's view of the world. Stung by a rightwing commentator who, in response to his rather modest criticisms of the Iraq war, described him as a \"liberal internationalist\", Patten writes: \"To my mind there is nothing else for a sensible person to be\". Evidently, Patten thinks the same is true of most of the opinions aired in the book. At times - in his analysis of the Iraq war, for example - he is plainly right. What is questionable is his assumption that the thinking that led to the Iraq war will prove to be an aberration.</p> <p>Patten begins What Next? by citing approvingly Margaret Thatcher's remark at her last cabinet meeting, \"It's a funny old world.\" By the end of the book, however, it is clear that he sees the past eight years as a blip on the screen of history. Along with liberals across the world, he is confident that, with a new incumbent in the White House, what could be considered normal service will be resumed. \"To live in a better world,\" he writes, \"requires a more democratic citizenry, a sentiment inherent in Senator Obama's presidential campaign oratory.\" But what if the debacle on Wall Street leaves America fear-ridden, resentful and more stridently fundamentalist - whoever becomes president? It looks as if the future of the world is going to be funnier than Patten imagines. </p> <p>\u2022 John Gray's Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia is published by Penguin.</p>",
  "<p>As a long election season winds towards its conclusion, political journalists know to watch for one telltale sign that is the best indicator of how a particular campaign is feeling about its chances. To put it simply: Is it leaking?</p> <p>I remember covering Hilary Clinton's first Senate race, against Republican Rick Lazio, in 2000. The race was close until late September, when she pulled ahead by six to eight points. Throughout October, the Lazio efforts became desperate. And in the midst of that, it became a daily entertainment to pick up the New York papers and see unnamed \"high-level sources in the Lazio camp\" pointing fingers at one another. When aides are using the newspapers to settle scores and set up a narrative that exculpates them from responsibility for the expected loss, you know that the circular firing squad is in formation.</p> <p>Earlier this week, John McCain, in an interview with the conservative Washington Times, said some nasty things about George Bush's handling of matters from Iraq to domestic spending in a last-ditch attempt to wriggle free of the shackle around his ankle that is the incumbent president. This, as you'd imagine, did not sit well with White House aides and even some other Republican political pros who believe McCain's problems have more to do with McCain than with Bush. The Politico newspaper picked up the scent and reported on Thursday that \"coordination between the McCain campaign and Republican national committee, always uneven, is now nearly dysfunctional\". One of those unnamed \"top Republicans\" told the paper: \"It drives you crazy.\"</p> <p>Democrats, having lost more presidential elections in recent history, are usually the ones cast in these roles. The New Republic, a leading liberal opinion journal based in Washington, even started publishing (in 1988, I think, after the Democrats' third straight loss) a Quadrennial Recriminations Issue. The editors there today are surely relieved but also a bit flummoxed at the likelihood that they won't be able to reprise the tradition.</p> <p>Before I go any further down this road: no, it ain't over 'til it's over (an old baseball saying, coined by the same fellow who once said something else that could apply to the McCain campaign, after taking a wrong turn on a driving trip with some friends: \"We may be lost, but we're making good time\"). At this point, it would probably take a completely unforeseen event for McCain to reverse Barack Obama's momentum. But unforeseen events happen, and Obama's lead is not insurmountably large. I've seen bigger ones dissipate in a week.</p> <p>Even so, without making any premature predictions, it is still possible to observe that what's going on now is that Republicans and conservatives are psychologically preparing themselves for defeat and starting to think about how to put Humpty together again after November 4. These arguments - I speak from long Democratic experience - usually have two components, the strategic and the philosophical.</p> <p>One contingent will argue that the problems were merely strategic, and that if a different kind of campaign had been run, victory would have been assured. Another group will insist the problems run deeper. I remember being at one gloomy postmortem in late 2004 when, after various folk offered their theories on why John Kerry had lost, one man simply shook his head and said: \"No one knows what we stand for any more.\" He silenced the room.</p> <p>There'll be time for that. But between now and November 4, keep an eye out for those stories featuring unnamed campaign sources griping that McCain should be spending more time in Pennsylvania, or less time, or no time at all. And take note : you won't see any such stories emanating from Obama camp. </p> <p>\u2022 Read Michael Tomasky's blog and watch his video commentary at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky\">theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky</a></p>",

This afternoon, a Pittsburgh police commander told KDKA Investigator Marty Griffin that Todd confessed to making up the story. The commander added that Todd will face charges; but police have not commented on what those charges will be. </p> </blockquote> <p>The story, first reported yesterday and embraced with vigour by <a href=\"http://drudgereport.com/\">Matt Drudge</a>, met with instant scepticism <a href=\"http://wonkette.com/403763/gop-gal-claims-savage-negro-mugged-her-for-obama\">elsewhere</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=10&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=the_secret_life_of_b\">web</a> and also from Pittsburgh police, who noted inconsistencies in Todd's story, such as whether the putative attacker could actually have seen her McCain bumper sticker in order to identify her as a Republican, and why camera footage from the ATM she said she'd used didn't show her. (The campaigns didn't make any assumptions, though: the Obama campaign released a statement sending \"thoughts and prayers\" to Todd, and she was <a href=\" http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/news/17789356/detail.html\">personally contacted</a> by both John McCain and Sarah Palin.) Fox News executive vice-president John Moody <a href=\"http://foxforum.blogs.foxnews.com/2008/10/23/jmoody_1023/ \">weighed in</a> with the opinion that if proven false, the story would mean \"Senator McCain's quest for the presidency is over, forever linked to race-baiting\". (Although he added, displaying bizarre Fox logic, that \"if Ms Todd's allegations are proven accurate, some voters may revisit their support for Senator Obama... because they suddenly feel they do not know enough about the Democratic nominee.\" How's that again?)</p> <p>In any case, though, the story failed the first internet test of racially charged anti-Obama smears: if <a href=\"http://michellemalkin.com/2008/10/23/why-that-mccain-volunteers-mutilation-story-smells-awfully-weird/\">even Michelle Malkin isn't willing to believe it</a>, it pretty much can't be true.</p> <p>UPDATE: <a href=\"http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/239757.php\">Footage</a> from the Pittsburgh police press conference.</p>",
  "<p>As the British media <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/24/mandelson-labour\">takes a closer look</a> at the intertwined interests of Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, Lord Mandelson, and shadow chancellor George Osborne, we Americans can claim a bit part in the saga.</p> <p>The Nation <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/doc/20081020/ames_berman \">reported earlier this month</a> on Deripaska's encounters with John McCain and his campaign manager, Rick Davis. The most colourful scene from their dispatch takes place in August 2006, when McCain celebrated his 70th birthday on a luxury yacht moored in Montenegro. Sitting in the same bay was the Queen K, Deripaska's even posher yacht, where <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/21/conservatives-partyfunding\">Osborne and Mandelson lived it up</a> in August.</p> <p>McCain aides said no one could remember Deripaska attending McCain's yacht party, although the two men had crossed paths at a dinner for international guests celebrating Montenegrin independence, which the Republican presidential nominee had long supported. Deripaska was also a promoter of Montenegrin sovereignty, albeit mostly <a href=\"http://www.russia-ic.com/news/show/7107/\">for business reasons</a>. </p> <p>(Raffaello Follieri was certainly <a href=\"http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2080292/posts\">a fellow reveller of McCain's</a>, although his 15 minutes of fame may have finally ended today with his <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedishrag/2008/10/anne-hathaways.html\">sentencing to 54 months</a> in prison.)</p> <p>No evidence has emerged thus far to suggest that McCain helped further Deripaska's political or financial ends, other than a veiled hint from Davis - cited by The Nation - about a joint business venture in a \"metals company\" that he represented. </p> <p>But one conservative watchdog group in the US went after McCain half a year ago for facilitating a fundraiser <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/apr/29/johnmccain.uselections2008\">at the home of Nat Rothschild</a>, the Deripaska associate at the centre of the Osborne-Mandelson row. Foreign donations, even \"in-kind\" contributions such as assistance raising money, are prohibited under American election law.</p> <p>So if the Osborne-Mandelson-Deripaska drama were to be made into a movie, McCain would undeniably have a walk-on role. He's already <a href=\"http://www.commonwealmagazine.org/blog/?p=2308\">got acting experience</a>...</p>",
  "<p>John McCain's closest advisers claimed today he is still capable of winning the presidency in spite of low morale inside his headquarters and in-fighting over who is to blame for the campaign debacle.</p> <p>With only 11 days left to election day, McCain's team is still desperately looking for a tightening of the polls, which today showed Barack Obama extending his lead in the battleground states.</p> <p>The chances of a turnaround were not helped by the huge falls on Wall Street and stock markets round the world. McCain had been in a near deadheat with Obama until the Wall Street meltdown in the middle of last month.</p> <p>Steve Schmidt, McCain's chief strategist, briefing reporters, admitted there was ground to make up but the campaign team believed a win was possible.</p> <p>He drew parallels with other presidential candidates who had come from far behind in the final week.</p> <p>But another aide, who asked for anonymity because he is not authorised to speak the press, acknowledged there is tension inside the McCain camp, without going into detail.</p> <p>Staff at McCain's headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, are already speaking about his campaign in the past tense and some, with hopes of a White House job diminishing, have sent out job resumes.</p> <p>Mark McKinnon, who had been a key member of McCain's team during the nomination battles but then left, told the Politico website: \"If you really want to see what 'going negative' is in politics, just watch the back-stabbing and blame game that we're starting to see.\"</p> <p>His team is bracing itself for an 8,200-word article in Sunday's New York Times magazine about in the inner circle based on interviews with half-a-dozen top advisers.</p> <p>Arguments within the camp range from the message to be pursued in the final stretch to whether it was a blunder to appoint Sarah Palin as McCain's running mate.</p> <p>The recriminations over her will not be helped by the resurgence of the Troopergate scandal, in which she has been found to have abused her power.</p> <p>She spoke at a rally in Missouri today before a team of lawyers flew in to take a deposition from her. Some McCain supporters regard her as a distraction from the main campaign.</p> <p>It was disclosed today that she paid a make-up artist $22,000 in the first fortnight of this month, following the revelation earlier this week of a $150,000 spending spree on clothes.</p> <p>The sums undermine McCain's championing of Joe the Plumber on the campaign trail as part of an appeal to working and middle classes. McCain, who was today in Colorado, a state that was previously solid Republican but which is in danger of slipping to Obama, kept the focus on Obama's plan to raise taxes.</p> <p>\"Senator Obama may say he's trying to soak the rich, but it's the middle class who are going to get put through the wringer, because a lot of his promised tax increase misses the target,\" McCain said.</p> <p>With Obama taking a day away from the campaign trail to visit his seriously ill grandmother in Hawaii, his place was taken by his wife, Michelle, who spoke at a rally in Ohio. Obama is due to return to the campaign tomorrow with a rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, another Republican state he hopes to turn.</p> <p>Madelyn Dunham, 85, his maternal grandmother, suffers from osteoporosis and is thought to have broken her hip in a recent fall. </p> <p>Obama is chastened by the memory of not being at his mother's side when she died in Hawaii of ovarian cancer at the age of 52.</p> <p>Obama went straight to his grandmother's small apartment in central Honolulu, where a small crowd of 50 onlookers had gathered. He was expected to spend the day with her at the 10th floor apartment where he lived from the age of 10 until he left for college in Los Angeles. Obama's half-sister has been living with their grandmother in recent years to look after her.</p>",
  "<p>Amid the fevered media fascination that has surrounded Sarah Palin since she was plucked from the decent obscurity of Alaska to become John McCain's running mate at the end of August, one theme has remained constant: that she has and will shore up and even increase the vote of the religious right on November 4. Palin has fostered it herself, most recently <a href=\"http://www.citizenlink.org/clspecialalert/A000008476.cfm\">going on James Dobson's show</a> to pal around with the evangelicals who are <a href=\"http://www.focusonthefamily.com/\">Focus on the Family</a>'s target audience \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.focusonthefamily.com/about_us/profiles/dr_james_dobson.aspx\">Dobson</a> himself being the self-regarding Svengali of the religious right.</p> <p>But on October 23 the Washington-based <a href=\"http://pewforum.org/about/\">Pew Forum</a> issued some <a href=\"http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=364\">polling findings</a> which, hidden in the graphs, show that the Palin effect may be pretty limited among the religious constituency too. Its figures show that indeed white, evangelical Protestant voters are still heavily supportive of McCain over Obama, by a margin of about two-thirds to a quarter. But the proportion has scarcely changed, indeed has possibly declined marginally, since Palin's epiphany on August 29.</p> <p>In polls since June, McCain's rating among the group has wavered from 61% to peak at 74% (bizarrely, recorded in the second week of October just as the Republican candidate's rating subsided following the Wall Street crisis) before currently settling at about 67%. But at the end of August the rating was running at 71%. In other words, the selection of Palin does not seem to have boosted McCain's support. The long standing suspicion of McCain among evangelicals does not seem to have drastically affected his support from that quarter or changed it much since Palin's selection, though it is running significantly lower than the 78% rating that George Bush achieved in the 2004 election.</p> <p>Given Palin's open and ostentatious appeal to that section of the electorate, she doesn't actually seem to have made much difference to its voting intentions. And that's despite her rightwing groupies' increasingly vociferous claims that she is the victim of a media witch hunt because of her values and homespun God-fearin' characteristics. As I write this, just such a missive has flopped into the Guardian's letters in-tray: anonymous, semi-literate and all in capitals, denouncing a \"flagrant smear and assassination agenda against Sarah Palin [by] columnists for the enemies of my country here and abroad.\" The same post has also gone to the New York Times. It might have more luck with Fox News.</p> <p>What may be true is that by enthusing the religious base, Palin's selection may have increased their chances of voting at all. As Dr Richard Land, premier spokesman in Washington DC of the <a href=\"http://www.sbc.net/\">Southern Baptist Convention</a> tells me, McCain himself would not have been even the Religious Right's second choice candidate for the Republican nomination, but Palin has revived their enthusiasm. Dobson, who earlier in the year said he could not endorse McCain has enthusiastically embraced his vice-presidential candidate (purely platonically of course) and so her place on the ticket probably ensures that many evangelicals do indeed turn out to vote. But her selection has come at a terrible cost in the wider electorate.</p> <p>By comparison, Obama's approval rating among white evangelicals has been pretty constant: 25% in June, 24% now, recovering from 18% earlier in the month. But among other religious groups he's not been doing badly at all: among mainstream white Protestant voters he's currently leading by 48% to 43% \u2013 more or less in line with general polls \u2013 and he's also ahead by 49% to 41% among Hispanic Catholics. Here's a surprise too: among black Protestant registered voters he is running at 94% to McCain's 2%. And among unaffiliated voters \u2013 not connected to any religious group \u2013 he is at 66% to 24%.</p> <p>The figures indicate that the white evangelicals \u2013 roughly 23% of the electorate \u2013 are McCain's most loyal constituency, wielding an influence out of proportion even to their numbers because they reliably turn out and vote in elections. But the vote is not as solid as it was four years ago, the evangelical movement has been riven by divisions over the environment as part of a growing debate about political aims and objectives and even churchgoers are not immune to economic concerns. Also, Palin has not had the transformative effect McCain's team had hoped. There has not been a barracuda bounce.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/general_election_mccain_vs_obama-225.html\">latest polls</a> show that the race for the White House, entering its final two weeks, may be <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/06/opinion/polls/main4504633.shtml\">tightening up</a>, with John McCain shaving down Barack Obama's lead to six points among likely voters. But at least among one particular set of voters - Latinos, who could make up as much as 11% of the electorate on November 4 - Obama <a href=\"http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=1599\">still enjoys</a> <a href=\"http://www.americasvoiceonline.org/2008/pages/conventional_wisdom_is_wrong_again\">60% support</a>.</p> <p>This is utterly remarkable, considering that just four years ago, George Bush won an unprecedented 40% of the Latino vote, a huge help in winning a second term in office. By comparison, McCain's piece of the Latino pie has <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/chronicle/6051023.html\">hovered at about 26%</a> for months. His recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/19/uselections2008.johnmccain1\">Spanish-language ads</a> attacking Obama's lack of support for a McCain-sponsored immigration reform bill have done little if anything to help his cause in battleground states with large Latino populations: Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada.</p> <p>So just how did the Republican party's recent gains among Latinos all but disappear during McCain's campaign? Well, he certainly had plenty of help from Bush himself and the party. After all, it was Republican members of Congress who sponsored a 2006 bill to classify undocumented immigrants and those who aid them as felons. That sparked <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/28/usa.danglaister\">nationwide grassroots protests</a>, each attended by thousands of Latinos, and led to bitterness toward the party within the community. Add to that the fact that McCain has <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M34KKaczvKg\">disowned his own immigration-reform bill</a> during the campaign, saying that he wouldn't vote for it now, and you've got a community who feels betrayed by the right.</p> <p>Little wonder, then, that McCain has spent little time <a href=\"http://washingtonindependent.com/7855/mccain-courts-latino-vote\">campaigning in the Latino community</a> until his campaign took a nose dive recently, while Obama began TV and radio ads in Spanish-language media since early 2008 and met with major Latino labour leaders to garner their support.</p> <p>While Bush's historic support from Latinos can be attributed at least in part to his growing up in the heavily-Latino Texas and counting Latinos among his advisers, McCain seems to have made no significant ties to the Hispanic community in his 26-year congressional career.</p> <p>The result? McCain has been endorsed by one Spanish-language newspaper - the decidedly lightweight and uninfluential El Diario de las Americas, whose endorsement editorial seemed to have been copied and pasted from McCain's website. McCain also boasts backing from reggaeton artist Daddy Yankee, C-list Mexican actor Eduardo Verastegui, and 50 Hispanic business executives - not one of them well-known - whose names the McCain press office recently released.</p> <p>Some analysts have said that a reason for McCain's Latino woes is that his story and record have not gotten out to the Latino voters. Not likely, as McCain has run for president twice now, speaking about his harrowing experience as a Vietnam war POW each time. It's more likely that Latinos, who historically tend to vote Democratic, like Obama's strong backing of unions (Obama's campaign slogan, \"Yes We Can\", is an English-language translation of revered Mexican-American civil rights leader Cesar Chavez's <a href=\"http://www.time-blog.com/swampland/2008/01/obamas_si_se_puede.html\">\"Si Se Puede\"</a>), his past support of <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/02/obama-defends-d.html\">driving licenses for undocumented immigrants </a>and his history of community organising in Chicago. </p> <p>But don't underestimate the power of Obama's personal story - the son of an immigrant, who faced down racism, worked hard to get an education and returned to his adopted hometown to help his community. That bio mirrors many Latinos' own backgrounds and aspirations, and the ability to vote for someone whose experience and values parallel your own may be the biggest motivator of all.</p>",
  "<p>Will Ferrell showed up as Bush last night to endorse McCain/Palin.</p>",
  "<p>Joel Haugen, a Republican fighting a tough congressional race against the Democrats in Oregon, has fallen out with his party. The reason: his surprise endorsement of Barack Obama for the presidency.</p> <p>\"I believe in putting nation before party and my first priority is following my conscience with regard to what is best for America,\" Haugen said in a statement issued by his office today. \"I have a huge amount of respect for John McCain, but I believe that he has more of a cold war mentality.\"</p> <p>Haugen is just one of many Republican politicians, dubbed \"Obamicans\", who have defected to Obama. The latest high-profile desertions include Scott McClellan, George Bush's former press secretary, who endorses Obama in a taped CNN programme to be broadcast this weekend, and William Weld, the Republican governor of Massachusetts from 1991 to 1997.</p> <p>Weld, in a statement released today ahead of a press conference in New Hampshire, described Obama as \"a once-in-a-lifetime candidate\".</p> <p>Last weekend, Bush's former secretary of state, Colin Powell, Obama's biggest Republican catch so far, publicly backed the Democratic candidate.</p> <p>It is unusual to see so many prominent Republican politicians and columnists shift, even allowing for the fact that party affiliations are more fluid in the US than Europe.</p> <p>The 'Obamicans' have their own website, <a href=\"http://www.republicansforobama.org\">http://www.republicansforobama.org</a>, listing those who have endorsed Obama and exchanging views. Campaign paraphernalia is also available from Barack Obama's team that includes a \"Republicans for Obama\" button badge.</p> <p>According to Haugen's campaign manager, Sarah Tiedeman, he made no secret of his views while fighting for the party nomination, telling the press about his unhappiness with Bush's eight years in office and that he was likely to endorse Obama over McCain. He won 70% of the nomination vote.</p> <p>The Republican party became increasingly \"unfriendly\", Tiedemann said, and has since withdrawn all financial support.</p> <p>Haugen, as a compromise, is now standing under an independent banner, though he remains a registered Republican. Tiedemann said the reaction among Republicans over his endorsement was mixed. She acknowledged it was 'unusual\" to make such an endorsement but Haugen \"feels the Republican party has got so far from its roots\".</p> <p>Other defectors include Arne Carlson, the Republican governor of Minnesota from 1991 to 1999, who wrote in the Minneapolis Star-Tribune yesterday: \"The choice of governor Sarah Palin as a running mate, and the resultant shallow campaign based on fear and suspicion, looks frighteningly similar to the politics of Karl Rove [Bush's campaign strategist].\"</p> <p>He described Obama as having \"the potential to become a truly great president\".</p> <p>McClellan. who published a book earlier this year critical of the Bush administration, accusing it of lying, told CNN he would vote for Obama because he offered the best chance of changing the way Washington works.</p> <p>The founders of Republicans for Obama include a former Iowa congressman, Jim Leach; a former Rhode Island senator, Lincoln Chafee, and a former Bush fund-raiser, Rita Hauser.</p> <p>Another defector this week is Ken Adelman, a foreign policy adviser to Ronald Reagan, who told the New Yorker he would endorse Obama because of McCain's temperament, describing as weird his behaviour in response when the economic meltdown began.</p>",
  "<p>So it's over. What started with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/07/uselections2008\">bluegrass</a> ended with Falstaff. </p> <p>There have been no more <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/sep/30/roanoke\">raccoons</a> (although I did see a whole family of five scuttling across Jefferson last week). </p> <p>And while I confess I am still baffled by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/07/uselections2008\">squeamishness</a> of some locals over being associated with bluegrass (I have yet to hear mention of another kind of music that could be associated with the area), I understand much more now why so many are proud of Roanoke and were sensitive to the possibility that it would be maligned or caricatured on the international stage.</p> <p>Friendly, vibrant, engaging, complex, diverse (economically more than ethnically) are just a few descriptions that spring to mind. </p> <p>The photo gallery that accompanies this piece hopefully gives a flavour of the city in all its glory and gory daily life. </p> <p>I also stand by my original description of Roanoke as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/29/younge.america.roanoke.virginia\">eccentric</a>. One evening I discussed pillaging with a man dressed as a Viking. His beard was plaited and he had an Obama sticker on his helmet. He said the woman with him was not his girlfriend, she just made his mead. </p> <p>It's not that people didn't notice, but the fact he was dressed as a Viking didn't seem to come up in any conversation. When I brought it up it was like I was the strange one. </p> <p>It was just one evening; and he was just one Viking. But along with the Obama supporter who wouldn't hear a bad word said about the confederate general Robert E Lee, the drama over the mouse infestation in the city market (did the mayor <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/news/breaking/wb/178852\">really compare it to 9/11</a>?) and the lady with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/23/barack-obama-art-roanoke-virginia\">monkey and the hats</a> at NoShame Theatre, I don't think \"eccentric\" is a push. Particularly after the Nader voter who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/06/uselections2008.barackobama1\">brandished a gun</a> in my direction.</p> <p>On one of my last nights in town I bumped into Chris Walters, last seen at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/03/uselections2008.sarahpalin1\">Republican vice-presidential debate watching party</a> a few weeks back. </p> <p>We were at the urinals in Fork in the Alley and Chris thought this would be an ideal time to impugn my journalism. </p> <p>He said I misquoted him as saying: \"I didn't dislike John McCain. But he is an independent thinker and I'm a conservative.\" I checked. I didn't. He then told me I had come \"with an agenda\". I reminded him that I was one of the few people who had suggested that \"Palin had edged it\". Chris said if that was true he would apologise. I'm still waiting. I guess being a Republican means never having to say you're sorry.</p> <p>But he was right on one thing. I did come with an agenda. To find out how this election was playing out in Roanoke, on issues both big and small. </p> <p>There were some stories I wish I'd had the time to pursue. I wanted to do one on gay life in the town, which seems to be a hub for gay folk from many miles around. I also wanted to write about the large number of mixed-race couples I seemed to spot everywhere. A few had spoken to me about issues with their extended families (some of them political) that I thought were intriguing. </p> <p>Most criminally I did not cover the war. I did make some calls, which lead to nothing. But since it kept not coming up I decided not to force it. Then at the Obama rally his biggest cheer was when he promised to stop the war. And I thought - it's in there somewhere, I wish I'd spent more time on it.</p> <p>Finally I wish I'd been able to get a better sense of what the Republicans were up to. I tried. God knows I tried. But while those on the Obama campaign <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/06/uselections2008.barackobama\">were extremely friendly and open</a>, the Republicans were ... well, more elusive. </p> <p>I sent two emails to the local Republican functionary, Mr Reedy, telling him \"I'm very keen to cover some Republican activities in the area and was wondering if you could point me in the right direction. </p> <p>\"We spent a morning, with a cameraman, at the Democratic party offices yesterday morning, spoke to some of their volunteers and went out canvassing with them. I was wondering if there was anything similar we could do with the Republican volunteers. </p> <p>\"We are committed, whenever possible, to present local politics in its entirety in a fair and balanced manner.\" </p> <p>I thought the fair and balanced thing might reel him in. No dice.</p> <p>I went by the office but he told me not to come in as no one would be able to speak to me without prior approval from on high. </p> <p>I blame this on the organisation. Most Republicans I did actually meet outside the campaign and away from the urinals were quite pleasant. </p> <p>Sarah Palin is coming to the next-door town of Salem on Monday. I wish I could be here to see it</p> <p>So with all those omissions what did I find out? That the Obama campaign seems better organized, better funded and in better spirits. That both parties have problems with their bases - Republicans with evangelicals and Democrats with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-barackobama1\">African Americans</a>. </p> <p>But while the Democratic problem is purely organisational, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/john-mccain-virginia-roanoke-campaign\">Republican problem</a> is more profoundly political. If the Republicans are fighting hard here, then they are fighting hard almost everywhere. And that means they are in serious trouble.</p> <p>I came because I thought it would be interesting. It was.

  "<p>Chicago is expected to hold its biggest party in memory on election night, with Barack Obama as the guest of honour, in Grant Park, a green expanse separating the city's downtown from Lake Michigan. </p> <p>And as with all festivities, someone will have to clean up.</p> <p>With the city facing a massive budget shortfall, the wealthy Obama campaign has agreed to foot the estimated $2m bill for security and cleanup following the campaign's election night rally in the 319-acre park.</p> <p>The city expects at least 70,000 revellers to attend the rally and hear what could be Obama's victory speech. The crowd could be even larger: Obama drew 100,000 in St Louis last week, and Chicago is the senator's hometown. He remains enormously popular here, and polls show him ahead in Illinois by as many as 30 percentage points.</p> <p>\"In addition to the normal permit fees paid for park rentals, the campaign is already making arrangements to assure that city resources are not used to clean up the park following the event,\" Obama campaign spokesman Justin DeJong told the Chicago Tribune. \"The campaign is also paying for substantial private security and [emergency medical] services to limit the need for city services surrounding the event.\"</p> <p>Rally-goers will likely have to endure long lines at metal detectors and have their possessions searched, as has been typical of Obama events since the winter. The US secret service and the Chicago police are likely to head up security efforts on election night, with Chicago fire fighters, sanitation workers and emergency medical crews also participating. The city will also provide extra buses and trains to get people to and from the rally.</p> <p>\"We're very excited to be able to host their campaign here in Chicago,\" said Jennifer Martinez, spokeswoman for the Chicago office of emergency management and communications. \"This is his hometown, and we're excited to show yet again an example of how Chicago can hold these large-scale events\".</p> <p>She compared preparations for the event to those for Pope John Paul II's 1979 open-air mass in Grant Park.</p> <p>Chicago mayor Richard Daley said at a press conference yesterday that cleanup and security costs for the festivities could run as high as $2m. The city is facing a $469m budget shortfall, and Daley has proposed laying off 929 municipal workers and cutting city services.</p> <p>The Obama campaign, meanwhile, is flush with cash, having raised a<br>record-breaking $150m in September.</p> <p>\"This is not a presidential visit. This is a political event and they've agreed to pay for all those services - all the expenses of that,\" Daley said yesterday. \"It's costly, but they raised quite a bit of money. There's no [shortage] of money in that campaign\".</p> <p>Asked if he would attend the rally, Daley answered, \"Why not?\"</p> <p>Grant Park, known as Chicago's \"front yard\", hosts concerts and festivals during the summer months, so the city is used to packing in crowds. The site was also the base for masses of protestors during the 1968 Democratic convention.</p>",

  "<p>Those poor Hollywood conservatives. If <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/features/people/e3i047c06d053d60ec823bb8e72ef411538?imw=Y\">this recent report in trade bible The Hollywood Reporter</a> is to be believed, having rightwing views in the US film industry these days is a bit like being a card-carrying member of the communist party in the 1950s. The screenwriter and blogger Andrew Klavan, who is known for his conservative views, said recently that the situation had become so bad in Hollywood that he found himself being asked if he would consider submitting his scripts under an assumed name, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_Trumbo\">Dalton Trumbo</a>-style. </p> <p>Nevertheless, there has been no shortage of actors ready and willing to tie their ribbon to John McCain's swiftly sinking campaign. The likes of Clint Eastwood, Sylvester Stallone and Robert Duvall have all come out publicly in favour of the Republican candidate although the list of actors in favour of Barack Obama is, perhaps unsurprisingly, rather longer. The cast of W, Oliver Stone's Bush-bashing biopic, which hits cinemas here next Friday, <a href=\"http://itn.co.uk/news/6f832aef839b3d0c5d29e486d19f4646.html\">said at the film's UK premiere on Wednesday</a> that they were supporting Obama. The famously liberal George Clooney is also in the Illinois senator's camp, along with Scarlett Johannson, Robert De Niro, Tom Hanks and Halle Berry.<br><br>Michael Moore, whose endorsement of the marginal leftwing independent Ralph Nader in 2000 was credited in some quarters for George W Bush's victory over Al Gore, has been clear in his support for Obama this time around. One assumes that the likes of Kelsey Grammer, James Woods, Jon Voight and Gary Coleman, who ganged up to lampoon Moore in the recent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/sep/30/an.american.carol\">An American Carol</a>, will be going McCain's way. As far as directors go, Ron Howard is so worried about the possibility of a McCain victory that he recently dressed up as Opie, his character from The Andy Griffith Show, and Ritchie Cunningham from Happy Days, in order to proclaim his support for Obama. <a href=\"http://www.aintitcool.com/node/38844\">You can check out the video here</a> (Henry Winkler even turns up, looking remarkably well-preserved, as The Fonz.) </p> <p>It seems to be something of a tradition in the US for actors to make public their political views, in a way which has not been seen in this country for a while. In 2006 the Oscar-winning screenwriter <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4785118.stm\">Julian Fellowes claimed that British theatre was filled with leftwing writers</a>, and called for there to be more writing from a conservative perspective. But we have no real equivalent for Clooney, or the famously do-gooding Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon. </p> <p>Personally, I find that the discovery that a particular actor has views which do not tally with my own does tend to negatively affect my perspective of them. But to be honest, I'm equally irritated by actors' public outpourings of any kind. The best thespians know that it's hard for the audience to immerse themselves in your work when they know everything about you. \"If there's anything unsettling to the stomach,\" Marlon Brando once said, \"it's watching actors on television talk about their personal lives\".</p> <p>When <a href=\"http://news.scotsman.com/world/Sean-Penn-visits-Hugo-Chavez.4608352.jp\">Sean Penn jaunts down to south America to kick it with Hugo Chavez</a>, it doesn't make me think more kindly of the Venezuelan president's Marxist leanings, and I can see why Clooney's antics can be hard for US conservatives to swallow, even though I'm usually sympathetic to <a href=\"http://uk.askmen.com/celebs/entertainment-news/george-clooney/clooney-darfur-plea.html\">the causes he's pushing</a>. Perhaps I'm missing the point: perhaps in a country where Dubya can be returned to power after almost ripping the world in two in his search for non-existent WMDs in Iraq, it's vital that people in the public eye stand up and offer a different perspective, but I'd really rather actors expressed themselves on film.</p> <p>The best scenes in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/126059/w\">Oliver Stone's forthcoming W</a> are those in which we see Josh Brolin, as Bush, making the decision to take on Saddam Hussein. The president is determined not to make the mistakes his father did and leave the Iraqi dictator in power. Stone cleverly shows us a facet of Bush's personality which some might not have been aware of: we knew he was bull-headed, but the full extent of his simplistic, tunnel-visioned approach to hideously delicate matters of extreme complexity is here made clear. Stone's film is not a perfect piece: at times it feels rushed, and it has a contrived TV movie style that lets down what is otherwise a poignant polemic, but at least the film-maker has done his talking on celluloid. </p> <p>Like Brolin's Bush, I suspect that many of those planning to vote for McCain are not the sort for last-minute U-turns. But if the film persuades a few undecideds to vote Democrat then it will have achieved Stone's purpose. Certainly, it has already proved <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/oct/20/max-payne-box-office\">far more successful at the US box office</a> than any of the previous attempts by film-makers to highlight the foolhardy nature of the war in Iraq, suggesting the public is becoming more open to negative assessments of the 43rd US president's period in office.</p> <p>Do you share my discomfort with actors' public endorsements of political candidates and causes? Or do you feel it's important that people in the public eye speak out on important issues? Perhaps you'll never be able to enjoy Woods' <a href=\"http://video.aol.com/video-detail/family-guy-i-have-james-woods/3179073694/?icid=VIDURVCOM01\">brilliant Family Guy appearances</a> again now that you know he's down with the death penalty.

  "<p>The storm over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a>'s lavish clothing budget continued today as a watchdog group filed a campaign finance complaint against her, while the vice-presidential nominee herself blamed the row on sexism.</p> <p>In a complaint filed to the US federal election commission, the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) argued that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/republicans\">Republicans</a> violated campaign finance rules when they spent $150,000 (\u00a396,000) on clothes for Palin and her family.</p> <p>The purchases came from a joint account, controlled by both national Republicans and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>'s campaign. At issue is whether the \"personal use\" ban on buying clothes with campaign money \u2013 a reform promoted by McCain himself \u2013 applies to such joint accounts.</p> <p>\"It is ridiculous that [Republicans] would spend $150,000 to outfit a vice-presidential nominee and her family at any time, but it is more outrageous given the dire financial straits of so many Americans and the state of our economy,\" said Melanie Sloan, the executive director of Crew and a federal prosecutor during the Clinton administration.</p> <p>\"As if that isn't bad enough, the expenditures violate campaign finance law.\"</p> <p>In an interview with the Chicago Tribune newspaper, Palin suggested that male candidates who dressed sharply for the campaign trail would not have faced the same scrutiny.</p> <p>\"I think Hillary Clinton was held to a different standard in her primary<br>race,\" Palin said. \"Do you remember the conversations that took place about<br>her? Say, superficial things that they don't talk about with men, her<br>wardrobe and her hairstyles, all of that? That's a bit of that double<br>standard,\" she said.</p> <p>Palin said the clothes purchased were not in line with her family's personality and most of them were sitting unopened on her campaign plane. </p> <p>\"The whole thing is just bad!\" she said. \"Oh, if only people knew how<br>frugal we are. It's kind of painful to be criticised for something when all<br>the facts are not out there and are not reported.\"</p> <p>The Crew complaint is unlikely to come before the election commission<br>ahead of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselections2008\">election</a> on November 4. But it does keep the Palin clothes budget on the political agenda for another day at a time when negative press of any kind could damage the McCain camp.</p> <p>Campaign finance experts are split on the legality of the purchases, with some concluding that the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/us/politics/23palin.html?_r=2&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin\">Republican national committee was allowed</a> to buy the clothes and other <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gN2UuEbyF64GtuHQfJzWDqDg7PqgD93VNPAG3\">election lawyers wondering</a> whether regulators would use the occasion to set a new policy on the subject.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/israelandthepalestinians\">Israel</a> moved closer to an early general election today when a key ultra-Orthodox party refused to join a new coalition government that the prime minister designate, Tzipi Livni, has spent weeks trying to put together.</p> <p>The decision by Shas, a rightwing party that represents religious Jews from non-European backgrounds, means Livni faces the prospect of either forming a slim, weak coalition or failing outright, which would mean an election early next year. Livni said a decision would be reached by Sunday.</p> <p>Livni, the foreign minister, narrowly won the leadership of her ruling party, Kadima, in an internal vote in mid-September. She was given six weeks to persuade others to join her in a coalition that needed at least 61 votes of approval in the 120-seat Knesset. She has secured the support of the Labour party, giving her a combined 48 seats, and can expect the support of at least one other small party, but had still hoped for the 12 crucial seats of Shas to form a clear majority.</p> <p>The negotiations were difficult from the start. Shas, as expected, made two key demands: a substantial increase in child allowances, which would benefit its supporters who tend to have larger, poorer families, and a promise that in any peace negotiations with the Palestinians the Israeli government would not agree to divide Jerusalem. Shas had reportedly asked for a 1bon shekels (\u00a3160m) in child allowances. Livni offered less money but proposed extending the jurisdiction of rabbinical courts in the hope of winning the party's favour.</p> <p>The party's spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, met with his advisers and decided to pull out of the coalition talks.</p> <p>\"Throughout the entire coalition negotiations, Shas did not ask for treats, titles or any political upgrade,\" the party said in a statement. \"Shas asked for real aid for the Israeli society's disadvantaged population and sought to protect Jerusalem. We cannot ignore the difficulties and hardship these days, when Israel has reached the first place in poverty among the developed countries.\"</p> <p>The Shas decision at first appeared to be final, but Eli Yishai, the party leader, went on Israel Radio and hinted a deal could still be done. He said it was in Kadima's hands. \"If they don't meet our demands, we won't be able to join,\" he said.</p> <p>A spokesman for Livni said she was sticking to her deadline of Sunday to conclude an agreement. The autumn session of the Knesset begins on Monday and she had hoped to address the parliament as prime minister and head of a new coalition.</p> <p>If the Shas decision is final, Livni could still form a coalition with other smaller parties, including the leftwing Meretz party, which has five seats, the Pensioners party, with four seats, or United Torah Judaism, an ultra-Orthodox party with six seats. </p> <p>Most political observers now say that at best she can hope for a slim coalition of 60 seats, which would put her at the head of a weak government. To win Knesset approval she would have to persuade other MPs to vote for the coalition without joining it.</p> <p>If she fails, the president, Shimon Peres, will probably call an election for early next year. Livni had hoped to avoid an early vote with opinion polls still forecasting a win for Benjamin Netanyahu's opposition Likud party.</p>",

Biden then told the room to \"<a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/20/biden-predicts-early-crisis-will-test-obama/\">watch, we're going to have an international crisis</a>, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this guy\".</p> <p>While the meaning of Biden's remarks was clear \u2013 he is quite confident that a President Obama will pass any such test \u2013 this was another unfortunate example of the voluble senator from Delaware tripping over his own tongue, going for baroque when plain speaking was called for.</p> <p>Jumping at the opportunity to pull the debate back to national security \u2013 an issue John McCain actually feels comfortable talking about \u2013 the McCain campaign blasted out a mass email that transparently misrepresented Biden as claiming \"Barack Obama's election guarantees an international crisis\". That is, they had Biden say what McCain has been trying to strongly imply for the last 10 months.</p> <p>Former New York mayor and McCain supporter Rudy Giuliani also piled on the criticism, calling Biden's statement \"extraordinary\" and asserting that \"it is not uniformly the case that the mettle of American presidents is tested\". Giuliani insisted that \"Senator McCain would not present that same risk that Joe Biden seems to be worried about\".</p> <p>Senator Joe Lieberman, one of John McCain's closest allies and confidantes, apparently disagrees. Appearing on Face the Nation back in June, Lieberman predicted, just as Biden did on Sunday, that \"<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/29/ftn/main4217516.shtml\">our enemies will test the new president early</a>\". The following day, the White House confirmed Lieberman's comments. \"<a href=\"http://www.democracyarsenal.org/2008/10/white-house-agr.html\">I think senator Lieberman, unfortunately, could be right</a>,\" said press secretary Dana Perino. </p> <p>On Tuesday, Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security, <a href=\"http://www.democracyarsenal.org/2008/10/chertoff-agrees.html\">also seemed to agree with Biden</a>, saying: \"<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&amp;sid=a7MuiagBPMz4\">terrorists may see the change</a> to a new US president over the next six months as a prime chance to attack, no matter who wins the White House.\"</p> <p>But the message coming from the McCain camp is clear: A President Obama would invite \"testing\" in a way that a President McCain would not. McCain's top foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann stated in a press call that \"in foreign policy, it is weakness that is provocative\". These sorts of arguments about credibility and reputation are inherently subjective. Yes, weakness can be provocative. But strength can also be provocative, especially when exercised without good judgment. </p> <p>After 9/11, McCain was one of the <a href=\"http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/06/06/mccain-the-war-salesman/\">foremost advocates of the invasion of Iraq</a>, justified partly on the basis that such an invasion would be a way of \"showing strength\" in response to the attack on our homeland. It turned out that showing strength by invading and occupying Iraq turned out to be both incredibly provocative and disastrous for America's security. The war attracted thousands of militants to Iraq, fueled unprecedented levels of anti-Americanism around the world and continues to bleed the US of lives and resources.</p> <p>The correct question is not whether a president is \"strong\" or \"weak,\" but whether his policies are effective. There is a general consensus among analysts that al-Qaida will, at some point, attempt another attack here in the US, and that attack will likely be generated from al-Qaida's base on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area, where they were allowed to regroup when the Bush administration turned its attention to Iraq. Al-Qaida clearly recognises that they have benefited from Bush's approach, which posits a war of civilisations between Islam and the west. The Washington Post reported today that a prominent al-Qaida website has declared its support for McCain, who they believe will faithfully continue the \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/21/AR2008102102477.html\">failing march of his predecessor</a>\". </p> <p>Given the era of global transformation and uncertainty in which we live, there's no doubt that the next president will be tested in a number of ways. Dealing effectively with tomorrow's crises will require the new administration to use the full range of US power - diplomatic, economic and military - and eschew the focus on military solutions that has resulted in an intact and active al-Qaida, an empowered Iran, a more destabilised Middle East and a less secure America seven years after 9/11. </p> <p>It's true that John McCain has been tested in the past, as his supporters claim. But his unstinting support for the ruinous policies of George Bush - and his promise that, if elected, he would continue those policies - has earned him a failing grade.</p>",
  "<p>The retailer regarded as a barometer for the state of the high street unveiled new sales figures today which point to another alarming slump in consumer confidence. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/johnlewis\">John Lewis</a> department store chain said trade was down a disturbing 7.6% in the seven days to October 18 - the week when the government was forced into an emergency bail-out of three of the UK's biggest banks. </p> <p>It is the fifth consecutive week of sales declines for the department store. </p> <p>The retailer said sales were hit by the different timing of school half term breaks in different parts of the country, but there was also a dip on the Saturday compared with the same Saturday last year when England played South Africa in the rugby world cup final in Paris and high streets were quiet. </p> <p>Only one store, in Aberdeen, recorded sales higher than last year and 17 were down by more than 10%. The worst performing outlet was Peterborough, down 25% on a year ago. </p> <p>Growth has also slowed rapidly at the department store's online business. JohnLewis.com was recording annual gains of more than 20% until recently, but is now up just 5.7% on last year. </p> <p>Earlier this week, a survey showed that internet spending in September was up 15%, compared with the 73% growth recorded 12 months earlier. </p> <p>The worst performing John Lewis departments were those selling homewares, which were down 13.5% on a year ago. Electricals and home technology were down nearly 10%, although fashion sales were ahead 0.9%. </p> <p>The company said it believed other retailers were performing even worse. \"We know that if it's tough for John Lewis, the chances are it's even tougher for everyone else. Our task remains to outperform the wider market and all indications are that we continue to do so,\" the store said. </p> <p>Earlier this week, Home Retail Group said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/23/argos-homebase-home-retail-group\">recent sales at its Argos offshoot were down about 9%</a> - the worst decline in the chain's 35-year history. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/22/debenhams-retail\">Debenhams</a> said sales had fallen 4% in recent weeks while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/23/dsginternational-retail\">PC World is down 11% in the past six months and Currys is down 7%</a>. </p> <p>A raft of retailers have announced cuts in investment spending to conserve cash. </p> <p>House of Fraser and Debenhams have been cutting prices to pull in shoppers, which is bound to hit profit margins. Over the past two weeks, HoF has been running a mid-season sale, while Debenhams has just had another day of \"blue cross\" discounts. </p> <p>John Lewis's Waitrose supermarkets are also under pressure as shoppers trade down to cheaper grocers and brands. Sales at the upmarket chain last week were ahead just 0.5% on last year's levels - including the impact of inflation. </p> <p>Economist Howard Archer of Global Insight said the financial crisis and fears about the economy had given already-nervous consumers another jolt: \"Given that John Lewis' department store sales are seen as a good bellwether for the health of consumer spending, the 7.6% year-on-year plunge in sales intensifies fears that retailers are in for an extremely difficult Christmas and beyond. </p> <p>\"There is no getting away from the fact that this is a very disappointing and worrying performance that bodes ill for the retail sector in general.\" </p> <p>Freddie George, retail analyst at Seymour Pierce, said: \"Our major concern is that retailers, particularly the apparel retailers, are facing both weak sales in the lead up to Christmas and greater promotional activity, which will impact margins.\"</p>",
  "<p>You have to hand it to the women at Code Pink, the all-purpose protest group originally formed to oppose the Iraq war. They know how to liven up a boring banking conference.</p> <p>Barely had Karl Rove arrived on stage at the Mortgage Bankers Association's convention in San Francisco this week when he was set upon by a Code Pink campaigner wielding handcuffs.</p> <p>\"Karl Rove is not fit to address you,\" she yelled, declaring that she was executing a citizen's arrest for treason.</p> <p>The former White House aide, who is presumably used to such attention, sat strangely still as his assailant approached. A security guard intercepted the meeting of minds at the very last moment (you can watch it <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Ili0jgn_JD4\">here</a>).</p> <p>If America's mortgage bankers were looking for quality time to digest the year's disastrous happenings, they were disappointed. America's most liberal city was not going to let them slip quietly in and out.</p> <p>To many people, the homeloans industry bears a large slice of blame for the financial crisis gripping the global economy. Irresponsible sub-prime mortgages in America triggered a chain of events which led to Bear Stearns' collapse, to Iceland's national demise, to queues outside branches of Northern Rock in Britain and to this month's slow-motion stockmarket crash.</p> <p>Many of the attendees I spoke to here in San Francisco were philosophical, at least willing to admit to a smidgen of wrongdoing by their peers.</p> <p>\"A lot of folks are embarrassed to be part of this industry,\" one mortgage lawyer, Ted Eric May, told me sadly. \"But there are a lot of very good, very smart people here. A few bad apples took advantage in every possible way they could have done.\"</p> <p>William Quick, a mortgage lender from Washington state, agreed but insisted that shoddy behaviour was all in the past: \"There's been a purge - a lot of the bad actors have gone into other industries.\"</p> <p>As the mortgage industry's lobbying group, the MBA wasn't too keen to dwell on its role in an international economic scandal - though the association's new chairman, David Kittle, did come out with a few revealing utterances.</p> <p>\"Everybody needs a roof over their head - but not everybody needs to be a homeowner,\" said Kittle, in a moment of apparent revelation which sounded more like common sense. \"As we move beyond crisis mode, we will learn from our mistakes.\"</p> <p>He went on to quote a verse from the book of Proverbs: \"He who seeks to increase his wealth by charging excess interest rates amasses his wealth for one who has pity on the poor.\"</p> <p>All decent stuff. But it was only when Rove turned up to speak that the mortgage bankers showed their true colours. </p> <p>President Bush's one-time right-hand man trumpeted the Republicans' standard attack line by blaming the crisis on Democrats in Congress for failing to introduce tougher regulation of America's two government-sponsored mortgage aggregators - Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.</p> <p>This claim, which has been repeated ad nauseum on the campaign trail by John McCain and Sarah Palin, refers to efforts by the Democrats to widen home ownership by getting Fannie and Freddie to buy up a broader spectrum of homeloans in the financial market.</p> <p>\"These were relentless political organisations masquerading as government enterprises,\" said Rove. \"There's always going to be an imprudent borrower and there's always going to be an imprudent lender. To have someone who's going to facilitate that is extremely dangerous.\"</p> <p>Getting a resounding cheer, Rove named two leading Democrats - Christopher Dodd and Barney Frank - as \"persistent and unnecessary\" defenders of \"egregious practices\". The mortgage bankers in the hall lapped it up. It seemed that it wasn't their industry's fault after all - it was the Democrats to blame.</p> <p>One banker even felt moved to shout: \"We love you Karl, you're great.\"</p> <p>It was down to George Mitchell, the retired Democratic senator and peace negotiator, to remonstrate: \"The implication that two Democrats on Capitol Hill are responsible for all the problems we have is completely untrue and so far fetched as to be unbelievable.\"</p> <p>It doesn't really wash for mortgage bankers to pass the buck. Fannie and Freddie may have been excessively willing to buy dodgy loans on the secondary market - but that doesn't excuse those who wrote the absurd homeloans in the first place. </p> <p>Last year, the Wall Street Journal <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119690485447515265.html\">found a Brazilian babysitter in California</a> who was approved for a $495,000 mortgage. A housekeeper, married to a taxi-driver, got a $713,000 loan. </p> <p>The biggest homeloans company in America, Countrywide Financial, had to be rescued from the brink of bankruptcy by Bank of America. This month, it agreed to amend 400,000 mortgages by as much as $8.7bn to settle investigations by prosecutors in 11 states.</p> <p>Picketers outside the convention wielded placards reading: \"Jail bankers! Let them rot!\"</p> <p>The MBA's chief operating officer, John Courson, was unmoved by such protests \u2013 he told me: \"This is America. They're free to say whatever they will to whoever they want to say it.\"</p> <p>Courson was keener to talk about initiatives such as Hope Now, which have helped avert a further 2.3m foreclosures. But he still seems to be in denial, insisting: \"I don't think the American public is upset with the mortgage banking industry.\"<br>Surely he can't be serious.</p>",

  "<p>We anti-conspiracy theorists have been mocked this week for suggesting there may be less than meets to eye to the yachtgate row, enjoyable though it has been for fans of Peter Mandelson, George Osborne and Oleg Deripaska (Russia's now-famous Mr Aluminium) - not to mention the novels of Evelyn Waugh.</p> <p>As the tale slips down the news agenda, at least until Sunday morning, it's prudent to ask: were we wrong? Earlier this week the official, off-the-record Tory line was that Mandelson had manipulated Nathaniel Rothschild into falling out with his old Bullingdon chum, Osborne, for betraying their August chit-chat.<br><br>We laughed at this, not unkindly, when we heard it from Conservative press officers \u2013 as we called them in more innocent days, before someone (possibly me) imported the self-promoting term \"spin doctor\" from the US in 1988. Did they really think even the Crown Prince of Darkness could sway such a rich, wild and worldly figure as the next Lord Rothschild, could persuade him to wreck an old and intimate friendship in so public a way?</p> <p>My working assumption was that - unless there were motives as yet unknown - this was essentially a social row that had got out of hand. By grassing up Mandelson when a guest of Rothschild, Osborne had embarrassed his Buller chum, as well as his yachtgate host and business partner, Mr Aluminium. Red faces all round, much anger, bad manners, bad form.</p> <p>The Tory tack has changed now. Today <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/2539376/osborne-stumbles-but-is-there-a-bigger-story-about-mandelson.thtml\">The Spectator</a>, the London <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23576973-details/The+\u00a35+billion+reason+Rothschild+knifed+his+friend+George+in+the+back/article.do\">Evening Standard</a> and its sister paper, the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1080165/Was-Osborne-knifed-Now-Mandelson-faces-questions-links-Russian-tycoon-plans-5bn-super-rich-haven-Montenegro.html\">Daily Mail</a>, plus others I can't afford because the FT is so expensive, all reflect the new line to take.</p> <p>It is to hint that it is really all about Deripaska's business empire, its ambitions, its current financial pressures (he needs to refinance loans in a global financial crisis) and the possibly sinister role in all this played by ex-EU trade commissioner Mandelson.</p> <p>Today's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/24/mandelson-labour\">Guardian plays a role in all this by revealing that Mandelson was seen dining with Mr Aluminium</a> in a Moscow restaurant as early as 2004, two years before the \"few social gatherings in 2006 and 2007\" mentioned in his statement; earlier too than reports of them meeting in 2005.</p> <p>This could prove significant, if more important developments surface. Meanwhile it's all grist to the conspiracy mill, which is now turning up photos of a hitherto little known port in Montenegro called Tivat. Apparently \"Hungary's biggest property developer\", a firm also called Tivat, co-owned by Nat Rothschild and a Canadian called Peter Munk, want to develop the old Yugoslavian naval base there as the new Monte Carlo.</p> <p>And Deripaska? He is apparently Montenegro's biggest employer (yes, it's aluminium), its Lord Ashcroft, you might say, in view of the Tory bankroller's mega-standing in Belize. According to the Mail, he makes the key calls to Montenegrin pols. </p> <p>According to the Standard, he also makes them to top politicos in places you've probably never heard of - like the remote Russian republic of Kalmykia, whose president promised in his campaign to buy every shepherd a mobile phone and sign up Diego Maradona for the local team. If only Gordon could be so imaginative!</p> <p>Lots of other Russian schemes, deep in the Wild East, are also mentioned. This is all great fun, wily foreigners with funny names, very probably with moustaches too. Sacha Baron Cohen will be found to have been on Mr Aluminium's vulgar gin palace, Queen K, if we search all the lifeboats. Lord Byron's name \u2013 always one to panic shareholders \u2013 has already been invoked. He passed through Tivat and liked it.</p> <p>So the real offence, so the new theory goes, must have been that Osborne inadvertently put Deripaska's name (try calling him \"Terry Pascoe\", it's easier) up in lights at a time when he is firefighting troubles within his empire: court cases, refinancing and stuff. The allegedly mooted \u00a350k donation was chicken feed. Proper money is at stake, not least in a complex court case over the disputed sale of Russia's second biggest insurance firm, Ingosstrakh. Mandelson's office became involved via MEPs who were supporting EU shareholders who blamed Deripaska when the value of their stake in Ingosstrakh was reduced.</p> <p>This may be important or it may be froth. It doesn't stop there: it never does. New Labour's Lord Byron (a fellow peer, did you notice?) apparently championed Montenegro's entry into the World Trade Organisation (WTO), an epochal event you may have missed. Nudge, nudge. I am beginning to see why Messrs Cameron and Osborne embraced the new American \"nudge theory\" last summer, though it was thought at the time to mean ways of persuading (but not instructing) voters to adopt better dietary habits.</p> <p>So, we are back where we were a month ago when Mandelson was recalled to the unByronic Brown cabinet. The papers are digging hard in search of conflict of interest, improper conduct and, failing all that, our old friend \"errors of judgment\" on Lord M's part (and Master George's). </p> <p>The diggers may yet turn something up, but before you invest in those costly Sunday papers, let alone put spare savings into buying land in Tivat, remember, they have had a month on the case already, with little to show for it except nudge, nudge. Perhaps the Nudge Hotel should be next to the Lord Byron when Tivat becomes the new Monte Carlo, or even the new Poole Harbour.</p> <p>As things stand, Mandelson has sustained some damage, though the spectacle of watching Sky News covering him making a business speech last night in Easington was a tribute to his box-office appeal. Osborne's flashily dangerous sense of style has also sustained more damage, though Dave is standing by him. Reports that William Hague is boning up to become shadow chancellor are premature. </p> <p>My hunch remains that Mandelson and Osborne will survive, albeit a little more shop-soiled. We'll see.</p> <p>Cameron, incidentally, is fingered in <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cameron-murdoch-and-a-greek-island-freebie-971470.html\">today's Indy for using Matt Freud's private plane</a> to slip off from his Turkish hols to Santorini in Greece, where he paid court to Matt's father-in-law, Rupert Murdoch. New Labour is hardly is a position, alas, to protest at such grovelling. The Great Schmoozer's own gin palace was later moored off Corfu. </p> <p>Surely, at his age, Rupert should be careful on such boats. Remember how poor old Bob Maxwell slipped and fell. But that is not our concern. Result so far? Much fun and laughter at the expense of politicians with a weakness for bling, nothing more serious, not so far.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/oct/24/corfu-party-funding-george-osborne\">Martin Kettle makes a good point in today's Guardian when he reminds liberals to temper their outrage</a>.

  "<h2>Swing states in focus</h2> <p>With 12 days to go, there's a distinct sense of the election shifting into its final phase, as the grand rhetoric of the national race gives way to an intense focus on the handful of states that will make the real difference on November 4. The candidates <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/24/florida-obama-mccain-republicans-democrats\">are ignoring huge swaths of the US</a>, Ewen MacAskill writes in today's Guardian, while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/24/mccain-obama-democrats-republicans\">an apparently panicked Republican party has started withdrawing money</a> from congressional battles it thinks it can no longer win. </p> <p>The most high profile case was that of the Minnesota congresswoman Michele Bachmann, who has been effectively disowned by her party after claiming Barack Obama \"may have anti-American views\" and calling for a McCarthyesque investigation of \"anti-American\" members of Congress. In the backlash, her rival, Elwyn Tinklenberg, has raised $1.3m in donations since the weekend. If Obama won the White House and the Democrats gained more seats in the House and Senate, Obama would potentially be in one of the strongest positions enjoyed by any Democratic president since Roosevelt.</p> <p>Still, whatever happens, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/24/barack-obama-mccain-white-house-left-handed\">a leftist is going to win the presidency</a>; Ed Pilkington writes both Obama and McCain are left-handed, as have been four of the last five occupants of the White House, in defiance of probability.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama is off the campaign trail in Honolulu, visiting his ill grandmother; Joe Biden is in West Virginia. McCain is in Colorado; Sarah Palin is in Pennsylvania and Missouri, and also must make a deposition today in the Alaska personnel board's investigation into the Troopergate affair - a separate investigation from the one that concluded against her earlier this month.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>A CBS/New York Times poll puts Obama's lead at 52%-39% among likely voters. Perhaps more intriguing than the 13-point headline lead, though, is Obama's strength among several groups that voted for George Bush in 2004. He's ahead of McCain among married women, suburbanites, white Catholics and those earning more than $50,000 a year. He's even \"competitive\", the Times argues, among white men. A Democrat hasn't won the white male vote since 1972.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/23/barack-obama-art-roanoke-virginia\">Video: Younge America - Now for the real election drama</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/cartoon/2008/oct/24/uselections2008-johnmccain\">Cartoon: Steve Bell on the Republicans in disarray</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/deadlineusa/2008/oct/24/uselections2008-colorado\">Deadline USA: 'Egg-mendment' rallies Colorado Democrats</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/23/sarah-palin-2012-election\">Comment is free: We've seen the last of Sarah Palin</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/24/uselections2008-barackobama\">Obama suspends campaign to visit grandmother in Hawaii</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/24/scott-mcclellan-barack-obama\">Former Bush press secretary backs Obama</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14891.html\">Politico.com: GOP forms circular firing squad</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=00c06f55-a5e0-48fb-a5e1-c3978ba94600\">New Republic: 'Whose side are you on, comrade?'</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/opinion/24fri1.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin\">New York Times: Barack Obama for president</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/mccain-finds-americans-no_b_137329.html\">Huffington Post: Americans no longer buying into the spec market on dread</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2202951/\">Slate.com: Obama's October surprise</a></p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"I can't take much more of this.

  "<p>In less than three months, the mandate of the president of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), Mahmoud Abbas, legally ends. With the Palestinian Legislative Council frozen since 2006 and the administrations of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salam_Fayyad\">Salam Fayyad</a> in the West Bank and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh\">Ismail Haniyeh</a> in Gaza both lacking democratic legitimacy, his is the last elected position in the PNA. </p> <p>Without a new ballot before January 9, 2009, Palestinians risk being left without legitimate governing structures, and the international community will not have a partner to continue the hollow \"peace process\". While the international community and Israel have had a major stake in undermining Palestinian democratic institutions, the question remains: what next for the Palestinian people? In fact, this breakdown may provide an important opening for new popular forces to rise within Palestinian national politics. </p> <p>To salvage what remains of Palestinian institutions, Egypt is attempting to broker an agreement between Fatah and Hamas. However, the first draft of a possible agreement reflects competing factional interests that render the talks fragile at best. Abbas's mandate topped the preliminary negotiations. Hamas had insisted on the illegality of an extension of his mandate, yet it seemingly backed down in front of Fatah's intransigency. </p> <p>Neither player in the West Bank PNA is in a position to run an election campaign now. Abbas, with a divided Fatah might lose the ballot, and if Fayyad is planning a candidacy, he still needs time to prepare. Realistically, it seems pointless to stage elections risking a Palestinian vote for a Hamas representative who does not please Israeli and western interests and would be brought down via sanctions and isolation. </p> <p>Hamas' concession for Abbas to keep his position beyond the electoral mandate only underscores the fact that the PNA is on the verge of institutional breakdown. Politically, Abbas is caught between the returns that Hamas will demand and the divisions within Fatah. An old guard of Fatah officials are gathering around <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Qurei\">Ahmad Qureia</a>, the chief negotiator of the PNA, calling for the Fayyad government to step down. Their main interest in Cairo is the construction of a new \"consensus government\" to shore up the power of the dominant parties and sideline Fayyad and his \"technocrats\". The old guard feel threatened by what they see as Fayyad's attempt to split Fatah or to wrest control from its traditional leadership. </p> <p>Fayyad is well placed to succeed in this mission. His leverage on the PNA's funding allows him to ensure that Fatah cadres, regional governors and other position holders depend partially on him for salaries and benefits. Further, the current reform of the Palestinian \"security sector\" eliminates much of the historical military leadership that arose in the diaspora during the 1970s and 1980s and which remains imbued with national values. Instead, new recruits <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/12/14/MNGIPMV3N61.DTL&amp;type=printable\">trained by the CIA</a> are taught a different line. As the Palestinian interior minister reportedly stated: \"You are not here to confront Israel, the conflict of Israel has until now led nowhere. You must show the Israelis that you can do the job.\" </p> <p>This is not the way to gain Palestinian popular support. Even after his almost daily visits to towns across the West Bank during this summer, US prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Fayyad holds no more sway with the people than does Qureia, whose name is still linked with the company that <a href=\"http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article2843.shtml\">provided cement</a> for the Wall. </p> <p>An alliance of Palestinian leftist parties, so far uninvolved in the power play around the PNA, would probably garner popular support by giving priority to the needs of the people and the principles of the Palestinian struggle. Yet they have so far been unable to concretely unite against the politics of factional interests. Until then, they will remain marginal in the national discussions.</p> <p>Amid the political haggling by leaders without a national vision, the Cairo talks will hardly go beyond the current draft agreement. This might avert an open confrontation between Fatah and Hamas, but it keeps the president's mandate legally questionable and politically unviable. Essentially, it produces committees which will discuss issues considered crucial to the factional interests but with little prospect of reaching conclusions. </p> <p>In this context, the PLO could be a fallback option. Though the revival of the organisation is on the Cairo agenda, recent efforts do not bode well. The latest attempt, led by Abed Rabbo (the PLO's chair) and Fayyad, was based solely on participation from the West Bank. According to their plans, the PLO would start receiving funds through the PNA, effectively putting the PNA into a dominant position. This would cripple the only Palestinian body representing Palestinians across historic Palestine and in the diaspora, abandoning all to a paralysed PNA. </p> <p>For the international community, the impending demise of legitimate and viable Palestinian structures of representation signals the end of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Mideast_peace_conference\">Annapolis process</a>. With the US administration in election mode and the Israeli prime minister yet to form her cabinet, it seems unrealistic that the promoters of Annapolis will succeed in coercing Palestinians before the end of Abbas's mandate into signing an agreement that reflects Israeli expectations and as a result will not stop the colonisation, fragmentation and isolation of the West Bank and Gaza. Abbas is not Arafat, who enjoyed trust and respect even without elections because of his role in the struggle and his charisma. Any new US or Israeli administration will lack a Palestinian partner with the legal authority or popular backing to sign such an agreement. </p> <p>For once, it seems time is on the side of the Palestinians, opening up the opportunity to reorder the ranks and define alternatives to the current political setting. A popular force created to shoulder the national responsibilities could build upon the large majority of Palestinians who have been alienated by the current party politics but are not willing to surrender their struggle. It can create national unity by focusing on the one thing missing from the Cairo talks: the struggle against the occupation and Israel's apartheid system of checkpoints, the Wall and settlements. This can lead out of the current political crisis, regenerate the Palestinian struggle, and create a viable national movement.</p>",

  "<p>The Democratic presidential hopeful, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>, touched down in Honolulu today to visit his sick grandmother.</p> <p>He took what is expected to be a 24-hour break from his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselections2008\">campaign</a> to spend time with the woman who raised him in Hawaii for most of his teenage years.</p> <p>Madelyn Dunham, 85, his maternal grandmother, suffers from osteoporosis and is thought to have broken her hip in a recent fall. Obama is chastened by the memory of not being at his mother's side when she died in Hawaii of ovarian cancer at the age of 52.</p> <p>\"My grandmother's the last one left,\" he told an interviewer earlier this week. \"She has really been the rock of the family, the foundation of the family ... I want to make sure that I don't make the same mistake twice.\"</p> <p>\"O Force One\", as his campaign plane is known, landed shortly after 7.15pm (0600 BST), its fuselage emblazoned with the original campaign slogan \"Change we can believe in\". That slogan has since been replaced with the more tangible \"Change we need\".</p> <p>Obama went straight to his grandmother's small apartment in central Honolulu, where a small crowd of 50 onlookers had gathered. He was expected to spend the day with her at the 10th floor apartment where he lived from the age of 10 until he left for college in Los Angeles. Obama's half-sister has been living with their grandmother in recent years to look after her.</p> <p>A strong-willed woman described by friends as \"bird-like\", Dunham was the main breadwinner during Obama's childhood. She rose from a secretarial job at the Bank of Hawaii to become one of its vice-presidents. Her earnings, and the sacrifices made by her and her husband, Stanley, helped to pay for Obama's education at one of the most prestigious private schools in the country.</p> <p>Obama has drawn on his grandmother's life story during the campaign. In one advertisement in which she appeared, he noted that she had \"taught me values straight from the Kansas heartland\", including \"accountability and self-reliance. Love of country. Working hard without making excuses. Treating your neighbour as you'd like to be treated.\"</p> <p>Accepting the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/democrats\">Democratic</a> nomination in August in Denver, Obama paid tribute to Dunham, who he calls Toot, short for a Hawaiian term for grandmother, \"tutu\".</p> <p>\"She's the one who taught me about hard work,\" he said. \"She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me.\"</p> <p>But Dunham did not necessarily share her grandson's political views. She is thought to have been a Republican voter in the past. This year, however, she took advantage of early voting to cast her vote in the presidential election.</p> <p>Obama was expected to leave his native Hawaii this evening and resume campaigning in Nevada on Saturday.</p>",
  "<p>As I've written about before, in addition to the elections this year, voters are being asked to decide several ballot initiatives across several states. In Colorado, voters are being asked to decide whether to amend the state constitution to read \"the terms 'person' or 'persons' shall include any human being from the moment of fertilization\". Conservatives say that it's a <a href=\"http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2008/may/08053007.html\">historic opportunity in Colorado to overturn Roe v Wade</a>, the US Supreme Court decision legalising abortion. Liberals are mocking Amendment 48, calling it the \"egg-mendment\".</p> <p>In the past, such controversial ballot initiatives have rallied social conservatives, but due to the broad nature of this amendment, Democrats say it's helping to motivate their supporters. Analysts also say that it draws attention to Sarah Palin's extreme views on abortion and alienates moderate women.</p> <p>Opponents have said that the \"moment of fertilisation\" is not a <a href=\"http://squarestate.net/showDiary.do?diaryId=5736\">medically recognised term and almost impossible to determine</a> outside of a lab. Opponents also say that it could force the state to investigate miscarriages and to limit birth-control methods. Blogger Zappatero at the PeakDemsBlog had this <a href=\"http://blog.peakdems.org/2008/05/q-and-eggmendment.html\">tongue-and-cheek question-and-answer on the amendment</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>When do we start having women register their periods with the government every month so we can track and investigate miscarriages?</strong> I'm sure our police forces will consider staking out the feminine hygiene aisle down at Walgreen's to be a far more important task than staking out, say, crack houses.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Economist looked at ballot initiatives in several states and said while it found that some such as California's ballot initiative to ban gay marriage would rally conservatives, they believed that this amendment in Colorado would actually <a href=\"http://www.theelectroniceconomist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12263114\">rally Democrats and moderate women</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>The \"egg-mendment\", as critics dub it, is likely to mobilise moderate women voters in opposition while drawing attention to John McCain's and Sarah Palin's strict views on abortion\u2014and this in a swing state. In November it will almost certainly go down in flames.</p> </blockquote> <p>I asked the bloggers at Democrat community site <a href=\"http://squarestate.net\">Squarestate.net</a> whether they thought the amendment would rally conservatives or liberals, something which could affect the presidential result in the state.</p> <p>One <a href=\"http://squarestate.net/showComment.do?commentId=35638\">blogger said</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I think the egg-mendment, along with the selection of the rabidly anti-abortion Palin, has a whole lot of independent Coloradan convinced they need to get to the polls this year, as if there wasn't enough reason already.</p> <p>I know several middle-of-the-road women who were undecided until the selection of Palin. As a wedge issue, it seems the abortion debate has started backfiring on the GOP.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another <a href=\"http://squarestate.net/userDiary.do?personId=944\">blogger on Squarestate.net said</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><br> The R(epublican)s that were heading to the polls to vote for this were either already on their way to vote for McCain, or cast a third-party vote because he isn't pro-life enough.</p> <p>On the other hand, this amendment will help to boost bringing out progressives who are passionate about women's rights but don't see that issue represented in the other initiatives.</p> </blockquote> <p>And <a href=\"http://squarestate.net/showComment.do?commentId=35642\">another blogger on the site added</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>If you get too broad, as South Dakota did with a similar measure, you start alienating even moderate Republicans. This measure separates alienates people who are merely anti-abortion but are not anti-birth control.</p> <p>Dems, of course, can now talk seriously about the need to take action to fight Amendment 48, and mobolize with it.</p> <p>Honestly, though, turnout in this election is being driven by the top of the ticket. Obama is bringing people into the process who have never participated before, and that is a big piece of why he won in the primary and caucus fight.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Despite being Catholic and opposing abortion, <a href=\"http://www.coloradostatesman.com/content/amendment-48\">Democratic Governor Bill Ritter has come out against the amendment</a> saying it would put the state between a woman and her doctor, and there has been a well organised \"<a href=\"http://www.protectfamiliesprotectchoices.org/\">No on 48</a>\" campaign. <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_20082/state_toplines/colorado/toplines_colorado_presidential_election_september_28_2008\">A poll in late September</a> found that 50% opposed to the amendment, 39% for it and 11% unsure.</p>",
  "<p>What we're finding on this trip is that Sarah Palin is an extremely polarising figure.

Only her supporters are pro-American, only her supporters are hard-working and only her supporters serve our country in uniform.

  "<p>Barack Obama has picked up another endorsement from a high-profile Republican as George Bush's former press secretary Scott McClellan announced he would vote for the Democrat.</p> <p>McClellan made his declaration, which had been expected, during the taping of a CNN programme to be broadcast on Saturday.</p> <p>\"From the very beginning I've said I'm going to support the candidate who has the best chance of changing the way Washington works and getting things done,\" the former White House spokesman told presenter D L Hughley. \"I will be voting for Barack Obama.\"</p> <p>McClellan's endorsement comes days after another prominent Republican, the former secretary of state Colin Powell, announced his support for Obama.</p> <p>McClellan's endorsement, however, lacked the stately tone of Powell's declaration. Appearing on comedian Hughley's first show, he was egged on to say something that would draw attention to the programme. </p> <p>\"We are a new show and your endorsement would probably mean a lot,\" Hughley said. \"But don't look at the fact that I am black or, no pressure.

Saying that he respected the Republican nominee, John McCain, McClellan told one interviewer: \"I also am intrigued by senator Obama's message. It's a message that is very similar to the one governor Bush ran on in 2000, and won on, promising to bring bi-partisanship and honesty and integrity to Washington.\"</p> <p>McClellan began his stint as White House press secretary in July 2003 before resigning in April 2006.</p>"
