  "<p>The opening was superbly choreographed. To the sound of thundering rock music blaring from speakers, several thousand people watched as John McCain's campaign plane swooped out of the sparkling blue Iowa skies.</p> <p>The plane taxied to a halt only 100 metres away from the crowd gathered at an airport outside the city of Cedar Rapids. They cheered wildly as McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, descended from the aircraft and trooped through the throng, smiling and shaking hands.</p> <p>Then things started to go wrong. 'Thank you so much, Iowa. It's great to be here in Grand Rapids,' Palin said as she took the stage, naming a completely different city in the far-off state of Michigan. 'CEDAR Rapids!' came shouts from the crowd. Palin ignored her gaffe and ploughed on with a speech that was quickly interrupted by anti-war protesters. For several minutes the hangar was filled with shouts and chants, drowning out the Alaska governor's words. Then McCain took the stage, and the same thing happened to him, forcing him off his script to address an unruly scrimmage as security hauled out the shouting demonstrators. 'The one thing Americans want us to do is stop yelling at each other,' McCain said in exasperation.</p> <p>Suddenly, after hauling his campaign back into contention for the White House, the wheels are starting to come off McCain's fabled Straight Talk Express. The gaffe-ridden rally in Cedar Rapids was only one indication. In a week of almost unprecedented economic crisis, when Wall Street seemed on the brink of meltdown, McCain's presidential bid was hit by mistake after mistake, varying from the serious to the surreal. </p> <p>As stocks dropped off a precipice, McCain said the economic fundamentals were strong. Then a senior aide seemed to suggest McCain had invented the BlackBerry. His top economic adviser, Carly Fiorina, confessed she thought neither McCain nor Palin was capable of running a large company. Then, in the middle of the worst financial collapse since the 1930s, McCain got the public endorsement of Donald Trump, a celebrity tycoon who symbolises raw capitalism. For a candidate trying to strike a populist tone, the backing of 'the Donald' was poorly timed. 'It's like a Saturday Night Live routine,' quipped rival Barack Obama on a campaign stop in Nevada.</p> <p>At the same time the remarkable surge of support inspired by Palin seems to be ebbing. Polls show women voters drifting back to Obama, who has established a slim lead again. Palin is increasingly mired in the 'Troopergate' scandal related to allegations that she fired a senior official out of a personal grudge against her sister's former partner. Palin's star, which shone so brightly for two weeks and reinvigorated the Republican base, is showing every sign of dimming. But the real problem is the biggest one: the stunning economic rollercoaster of last week. Americans in their tens of millions have been glued to their TV screens watching banks collapse, stocks slide and their own government pump billions of dollars into the system to bail out troubled banks and insurers. It has turned the election right back to the core issue that Democrats have wanted to talk about all along: the economy and its terrible woes. McCain, with the first presidential debate looming this week, is now fighting the election on his opponent's strongest turf. In an America shaken and scared by the spectre of a second Great Depression, no one is talking about pigs, lipstick or moose-hunting any more.</p> <p>But McCain is nothing if not a fighter. In Cedar Rapids he came out blazing against Wall Street, reckless investors and the regulators who let them place such risky bets. His speech was full of fiery language as he vowed to sack government officials, defend US workers and clean up Washington DC. 'Right now you are hurting and it is not your fault,' he told the crowd of several thousand packed into an aircraft hangar. 'It started at the top. It started in Washington. It started on Wall Street and we are going to fix it.' </p> <p>The crowd dutifully cheered its support, swinging behind this new image of McCain as a man of the people. The applause lines just kept on coming. 'They turned our markets into a casino,' McCain added, to more cheers. 'The regulators were asleep at the switch. They were asleep, my friends. They were not working for you,' he said. It seemed to work, too, though only with an all-Republican crowd that had long bought into his message. 'I am very excited about this. McCain right now is the best thing for this country,' said Harry Meek, owner of a local Iowa pest management company, who had driven more than 100 miles to get to the rally. </p> <p>Outside the confines of a friendly Republican crowd, McCain's message is likely to meet greater resistance. For many years, McCain has been an outspoken advocate of easing restrictions on Wall Street, not tightening regulations. His campaign is closely linked to lobbyists and the financial industry is a huge donator to his cause. That has allowed Obama's speechwriters to hurl some sharply worded barbs. 'The old boys' network? In the McCain campaign, that's called a staff meeting,' is one of Obama's most popular lines in his current stump speech.</p> <p>At the same time McCain is facing an American electorate likely to blame eight years living under a Republican White House for the current mess. The words that McCain never mentions on the campaign trail are 'President George W Bush'. In effect, McCain has to run against what his own Republican party has done for the last two presidential terms, almost turning his campaign into a third party. But the Bush legacy is still likely to cast a deep shadow over his efforts. 'It is hard for his message to ring true: \"If you elect me I will finally clean up Washington, having been there for 30 years\",' said Professor Seth Masket, a political scientist at Denver University. 'It is a really hard needle to thread.' </p> <p>The economy is not the ground on which McCain wanted to fight the election. His line last week that 'the fundamentals of our economy are strong' was the latest in a long list of verbal mistakes he has made over economic issues. The subject has been a weak one for Republicans ever since the Bush administration turned a surplus into a massive deficit and jobless figures started creeping up. </p> <p>A recent Washington Post poll found that people preferred Obama on the economy by 51 per cent to 39 per cent. Almost three-quarters of people said Obama understood their economic problems, compared with only 53 per cent who thought McCain felt that way. Certainly McCain's recent successes in the polls have not been built on his economic image. Instead they were boosted by a tough, disciplined message machine that had successfully torn into Obama's image and accused him of being elitist, liberal and sexist. But now that apparatus of attack is starting to splutter too. Reporters on McCain's campaign plane recently staged a protest against a decision to cut off access to McCain. They chanted 'Bring Mac back!' as they sat in their plane seats. The demonstration had little impact but showed how broken relations have become with the press corps that once fawned upon the candidate.</p> <p>At the same time, the hard-edged anti-Obama attacks have become so extreme that many commentators have accused the campaign of outright lies. Even the conservative Fox News channel joined the debate when one of its anchors publicly ripped into a senior McCain spokesman on air for misrepresenting Obama's tax plans.</p> <p>Finally, to add to the misery, there has been a slew of negative news about Palin. After first promising to co-operate in the Troopergate investigation in Alaska, she has now refused to testify. So has her husband, Todd. The McCain campaign is taking the whole issue so seriously that it has dispatched a rapid response team to Alaska to rebut the regular new revelations emerging from the state. The effort is being directed by lawyer Edward O'Callaghan, a McCain aide who was previously a terrorist expert. Polls have shown that the story has damaged Palin, and a carefully planned media rollout, via a series of TV interviews, has done little to blunt it. After massive swings in her direction after her stunning debut at the Republican convention, the pendulum of popularity has started to reverse course. Last week one poll showed Palin registering an 11-point drop in support among women. Another showed white women voters going back to Obama by a margin of 21 points. Not that anyone could tell that from Palin's performance in Iowa. When not shouting over the noise of protesters, she doggedly delivered her trademark speech, complete with introduction of her husband as 'First Dude' and touting her experience as a 'mom'. She exuded confidence and kept up the barrage of attacks on Obama. 'He likes to point the finger of blame,' she said of the Democratic candidate 'But has he ever really lifted a finger to help?' </p> <p>The message is aimed at people like Ron Eversman and small towns like Newton, Iowa. Eversman, a baker, was sitting last week in the neat square at the heart of Newton, a town surrounded by cornfields and reeling from the closure of a factory and the loss of hundreds of jobs. It is a story repeated all over America and uppermost in voters' minds. Eversman had watched the events on Wall Street unfolding with a mixture of fear and grim fascination. 'It sure isn't good, is it? I have a little investment and it has taken a beating,' he said.</p> <p>Eversman had good news for Obama. He plans to vote for him. 'McCain is too much like Bush. He's better than Bush, of course. But I want something different.' But it would be a mistake to think the Democrats have the support of Eversman - and millions of worried voters like him - sewn up. Eversman admitted that he could change his mind by November. 'I don't think Obama is any kind of saviour or anything,' he said with a shrug.</p> <p>The economic crisis holds many pitfalls for Obama too. His style and rhetoric have been based on lofty idealism and inspiration. That created an astonishing political movement, based on young voters, black people and the well educated. But, as Hillary Clinton showed in the final weeks of her nomination run, Obama is vulnerable to a candidate who can tap into the deep concerns of working-class white America. His choice of Joe Biden as a running mate was meant to solve the issue, but so far the Delaware senator has had little impact, apart from developing a long line of mistakes, including opining that Clinton might have been a better choice. Obama himself might have trouble striking a populist tone, too. As the first black candidate of a major party, his staff is aware that he cannot afford to be portrayed as the 'angry black' candidate. His appeal is based on unity, good governance and an attempt to be 'post-racial'. </p> <p>Like McCain, he has been hit by some unfortunate events in the past week. Both campaigns seem to be expert at attacking each other and less good at their own performance. First, Biden called for rich people to pay more taxes as their patriotic duty. That comment was co-opted into McCain's speech literally within hours. 'Raising taxes in a tough economy is not patriotic. It is not a badge of honour. It is just plain dumb,' McCain said in Cedar Rapids, getting the biggest cheer of the rally.</p> <p>Then Obama was hit by the fund-raising needs of his campaign. As the economic crisis sloshed over the country, he held a celebrity-studded event in California, at which Barbra Streisand sang. The cost for a ticket was a staggering $28,500(\u00a315,500). Obama was ruthlessly mocked on the late-night talk shows. 'All the big Hollywood stars were there... I believe the topic was how John McCain is out of touch with the common people,' quipped TV host Jay Leno.</p> <p>But there is little doubt that the Democrats are now much happier to be fighting this election on economic issues. The past few weeks of 'Palin mania' threw them off balance. Now it has put their campaign where it always wanted to be: attacking McCain directly and making it about serious issues. The airwaves are full of Obama ads portraying McCain as out of touch and Obama as in tune with the needs of ordinary people. They even include a two-minute advert in which Obama outlines his economic agenda. 'That's a pretty amazing ad to be running. It shows how serious people are taking this,' said Masket. On the stump last week Obama launched salvo after salvo in McCain's direction. 'What we've seen the last few days is nothing less than the final verdict on an economic philosophy that has completely failed,' he said at a Colorado rally. The Democrats are sensing their chance again. The polls bear them out. They are back in the game. Obama has re-established a small but solid lead in recent surveys. The RCP average of polls has him two points ahead of McCain. In the key battleground states things are tight again. </p> <p>A week ago all the buzz was about McCain closing the gap in Democratic strongholds like New York and New Jersey. Now the stress is on Obama's growing strength in red states like Virginia, Colorado and North Carolina. With seven weeks to go, the election is swinging to and fro but is still too close to call. </p> <p>Yet as the economic crisis has swept all before it and dominated the headlines, a few people are beginning to question what it is that the next occupant of the White House is going to inherit. 'Whoever it is, Obama or McCain, I really don't envy the next President,' said Masket.</p> <h2>Locking horns</h2> <p>'I could walk [100 miles] from here to Lansing and I wouldn't run into a single person who thought our economy was doing well, unless I ran into John McCain.'<br><strong>Joe Biden</strong>, Monday</p> <p>'The fundamentals of our economy are strong. But these are very, very difficult times.' <br><strong>John McCain</strong>, Monday</p> <p>'Yesterday, John McCain actually said that if he's President he'll take on, and I quote, \"the old boys' network in Washington\" ...

  "<p>Susan Tabb, of Brentford, writes a plaintive little letter to the Guardian. I am, says Ms Tabb, 'utterly sick of the obsession that the British media have with America, with Obama, McCain and Palin. For months we have been subjected to the minutiae of a campaign which I have found utterly baffling and infinitely boring. My only interest is to know who finally gets elected.'</p> <p>Ms Tabb notwithstanding, we're used to intensive coverage of American elections. The US is the superpower that jerks our strings. What America decides clearly affects us - and not just when one catches Wall Street pneumonia. The movies we see and books we read coat American political coverage in an exotic sheen of personal drama. Barack, Hillary, John... and now sexy Sarah? Hollywood couldn't make it up.</p> <p>Even so, there's something new in the mix here as star British columnists and feature writers join the coverage circus. Let's call it a confusion of audiences. Once upon a non-digital time, ordinary Americans were barely aware of Britain, let alone British journalists. They may have recognised Alistair Cooke when he introduced Upstairs, Downstairs on Masterpiece Theatre, but his radio letters were far off their radar. Erstwhile Fleet Street giants could be posted to Washington and find nobody picking up the phone when they called.</p> <p>Brits - like foreigners from any spot on the globe outside the US - were the great excluded. They didn't have influence. They were media pygmies. Therefore their role was as explainers and interpreters to the folks back home. They described what was going on. They gave you a flavour of how it felt. But they never supposed themselves DC movers or shakers.</p> <p>It isn't like that any more. Rupert Murdoch, the old wizard of Oz, has turned King of New York (where, from the Journal to the Post to Fox News, he's a player). The editors of the Times, Guardian and FT have all worked in America. The FT has a transatlantic fight on its hands. The wonder of satellite or cable brings CNN and Fox direct to millions of UK front parlours. The BBC, restlessly expanding, has worldwide ambitions with the Big Apple at their core. And then there's the net.</p> <p>In one sense, Britain-based unique users of news websites are more valuable than overseas visitors, because they provide a coherent ad market. But the British end is also the smaller end - 34 per cent of the Telegraph's net users live in the UK, 36 per cent of the Times's, and 29 per cent of the Mail's 18.7 million readers a month. Where do the foreign users mostly live, then? Almost overwhelmingly, they're American-based. Just look at the five or 10 most visited stories on all these sites. Just watch as Mail user figures bounce up and down from month to month. </p> <p>A Mail story link to Matt Drudge or some right-wing blogger will do that trick. The Guardian has a US-specific net service. In short, British newspapers and broadcasting stations are no longer islands of domestic news but part of the great American maw. And this makes a huge difference - not just to the extent of the coverage, but to its tone and direction, too.</p> <p>Since Ms Tabb is a Guardian reader, it's natural enough to look at Guardian election coverage, led by Michael Tomasky, US editor, a prolific and vibrant American liberal voice. He wanted Hillary to win; now he wants Obama to win. And he argues his case with aplomb. But intrinsically, it's an American case for an American audience. It isn't reporting in any traditional sense. It treats the reader as part of the great electorate. (In a recent blog, he lusted after a British-style US tabloid that could take Palin to the cleaners.)</p> <p>And the story isn't so different elsewhere. Gerry Baker at the Times does a wonderful neocon turn. Andrew Sullivan on the Sunday Times writes as a soldier from the battlefield. The Moggs and the Daleys, the Melanies and the Jans, all take up the same tune. They seem to know more about Alaska than about Accrington; and perhaps they think that their audience is there, too.</p> <p>But, in style, in the assumption of knowledge and involvement, this means something different. Not description, but denunciation. Not observation, but annihilation. 'Martin Kettle writes a nuanced piece on the Republicans and gets a dozen responses,' one UK blogger observed on the Guardian's site recently. 'Michael Tomasky writes something that would sit well in a student rag mag and gets the best part of 50. Mr Kettle should learn to play to the gallery more.'</p> <p>That is unfair to Tomasky: no student journo, he. But it also says that Kettle, a Brit with a cool, non-American eye, was looking to serve a domestic audience in need of outside analysis: and that Ms Tabb was right on the button.</p> <h2>How one writer spotted what the economists had missed</h2> <p>It's too soon in the Great Crash of 2008 to begin handing out reporting and commentary trophies. McRae (the Independent), Kaletsky (the Times), Pratley (the Guardian), Wolf (FT) - and the incredible Peston of the BBC, provider of stonking exclusives and increasingly idiosyncratic parodies of himself. We're well served in Britain, where business coverage makes stars (and editors). It isn't too soon, though, to see a great competition coming for the sage who most presciently and accurately predicted what would happen. Call it the Simon Jenkins (pictured) Heritage Prize in honour of his prescient July blast: 'Where are the economists? As the nation approaches recession, an entire profession seems to have vanished over the horizon, like conmen stuffed with cash, and thousands left destitute behind. They said recessions were over. They told politicians to leave things to them and all would be fine. Yet they failed to spot the sub-prime housing crash.' Quite so. And don't think that press barons are much better placed. Rupert Murdoch? As the Columbia Journalism Review gleefully notes: 'Of all the times in the Wall Street Journal's 119-year history, this year was the worst to de-emphasise business news' (excepting 1929-30, of course). Murdoch and editor Robert Thomson have given the front page over to non-business news to an unprecedented extent. The entire front section reads more like the Washington Post than the Journal of even a year ago. And, what about launching a luxury magazine while Wall Street goes down the toilet?' </p> <p>'Hard times are good for big companies,' said Murdoch last week - but they're bad for reputations.</p> <h2>\u00a3100m would buy a lot of ties for Jon Snow</h2> <p>WIPE AWAY zillions of dollars and thousands of City jobs in a trice and some ongoing media debates shrivel in embarrassment. Take Channel 4's supposed funding gap - of maybe \u00a3100m - by 2012. Yes, the channel's chief executive Andy Duncan is rattling his tin mug again and Ed Richards of Ofcom is listening.</p> <p>By 2014, says Ed, both ITV and Five should be free of their public service responsibilities - and he's worried about news, where 'plurality is unashamedly an end in itself. At the level of national and international news, the market may well deliver it, but the picture is different in the nations and, to a degree, in the regions. Absent a strong alternative voice to the BBC and there would be a real loss of plurality and a weakening of our interests as citizens'. So slice \u00a3100m off the licence fee and hand it to C4? That's where this orchestrated debate is heading. But pause and ask a question or three.</p> <p>Michael Grade put the news back at 10pm because he believes a major channel needs news as a potent part of its package. Would he just shrug and ditch that conviction after 2014? </p> <p>Has anyone at Ofcom watched the rival regional news operations recently, as they play Little Sir Echoes? Local news makes sense. Regional news is a much more stilted, artificial construct. </p> <p>And what, apart from keeping the excellent Jon Snow in new ties and interviewees, would Mr Duncan be spending his slice of our millions on?</p> <h2>Sands' strong family values</h2> <p>Sarah Sands has taken over the chair at Reader's Digest on a pleasing wave of self-generated publicity. She threw a suitably fine party to launch issue one last week - and she clearly has the mix of journeys, adventures and human triumphs clear in her head. It is an odd, slightly archaic mix, but it sells 650,000 or so a time in the UK alone. And the vital core of that success is good people, doing good, challenging things, and being thoroughly nice to each other in a benign, family world - with family reading and, as it happens, family writing. Read the comedian Kit Hesketh-Harvey on 'Why I don't use credit cards' this month. He's Sarah's brother. Then read Catherine Rabett, married to Hesketh-Harvey, on 'My health secret' - the 'genius' Mirena sperm-stifling coil that allows you to 'resume a normal life, full of fun and frolics'. Shush dear! Not in front of the family...</p>",

After the throwing out of corruption charges against his political rival Jacob Zuma and allegations of his interference in the process, Mbeki announces yesterday that he will accept a call to resign from the governing ANC.</p>",
  "<p>South Africans are contemplating the end of a political era this weekend after the country's President, Thabo Mbeki, yesterday announced his decision to resign after nine years in office.</p> <p>The statement, made through a spokesman, came during a day of high drama after the national executive committee of the African National Congress said it had decided to 'recall' Mbeki from his post following a fraught meeting on Friday night that went on until early yesterday.</p> <p>'Following the decision of the national executive committee of the African National Congress to recall President Thabo Mbeki, the President has obliged and will step down after all constitutional requirements have been met,' said the statement. The ANC secretary-general, Gwede Mantashe, said Mbeki had been calm 'as normal' when given the news. 'He welcomed the news and agreed that he is going to participate in the parliamentary process.' </p> <p>The decision clears the way for Mbeki's chief rival, Jacob Zuma, to take over the country. But the cabinet is likely to have to select an interim President because Zuma is not an MP and is therefore not qualified to stand. Mbeki has called for his cabinet to assemble today and Parliament is expected to meet in the coming days to formalise the resignation. Mantashe said Zuma was meeting cabinet ministers to persuade them to remain in their jobs. He said the top priority was to focus on 'ensuring the smooth running of the country'.</p> <p>'We share the desire for stability and for a peaceful and prosperous South Africa,' Mantashe told reporters.</p> <p>Mbeki succeeded Nelson Mandela in 1999 and was due to stand down next year. After devoting his life to the ANC, he had been expected to go in the middle of next year, having completed two terms in office. His premature fall came after a high court judge ruled that there had been 'political meddling' in the decision to press ahead with corruption and fraud charges against Zuma, who ousted Mbeki as president of the ANC in December last year.</p> <p>In his ruling on 12 September, Judge Christopher Nicholson said it appeared that Mbeki and his Justice Minister had colluded with prosecutors against Zuma as part of the 'titanic power struggle' within the ANC. Mbeki has indignantly denied the accusations. The charges were linked to a multi-billion-rand arms deal involving, among others, British Aerospace. Zuma's financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, is already serving a 15-year jail term on similar charges.</p> <p>Yesterday Mantashe said that last week's decision by the National Prosecuting Authority to prolong the argument by appealing against the judge's ruling had been a factor in deciding to recall Mbeki. Zuma had reportedly said there was no need to chase Mbeki out of office because there was no point in beating a 'dead snake'. </p> <p>The crucial question that had been facing the country was whether Mbeki would fight for his political life, or dissolve parliament and call a general election, which could have reduced the country to a full-blown crisis.</p> <p>It appears the national executive had calculated that Mbeki would step down voluntarily. If he had not done so, it would have had to push for a parliamentary vote of no confidence in the President - which would have forced all ministers and deputy ministers to resign.</p> <p>Under the constitution, if the President resigns or dies, the Deputy President would take over. But the Deputy President, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka - a strong Mbeki supporter - has indicated she would resign with Mbeki. This would mean that an interim President would have to be chosen by cabinet or, failing that, strict rules on succession could lead to the speaker becoming leader until a new President is elected.</p> <p>ANC officials are appointed and recalled from their posts according to the wishes of the party - they are not directly elected. 'Parliament should have the last word, not some kangaroo court of the ANC NEC,' said opposition leader Bantu Holomisa, of the United Democratic Movement.

  "<h2>Marjorie Nshemere Ojule<br>32, Ugandan refugee, now a trustee of Women for Refugee Women in the UK</h2> <p><strong>'If my husband is out there, if he sees my photo, I would love him to contact me'</strong></p> <p>In Uganda I was active in opposition politics at a grassroots level: working in my village, helping women to know their rights and teaching them reading and writing. I was detained twice. The horror that I experienced in there, you wouldn't wish that on anyone, not even your enemy. I was tortured, I was raped, I was burnt with cigarettes, I was cut with razors, electric shocks: all the horrible things you can think of to get information from someone. Eventually I escaped and came to England. It was scary but I'd been in this torture for some time, and I just wanted to be able to breathe fresh air again. I left my husband when I escaped and that's the last time I saw him. I don't have a clue where he is. If he's out there, if he sees my photo, I would love him to contact me. I may be dreaming about him when he's already dead but life is full of surprises. </p> <p>The child I have now is out of rape and at first I didn't want to keep her, I wanted to put her up for adoption. When I arrived in 2002, they took me to the hospital: I was malnourished, I was dehydrated, I didn't have any blood and the Home Office told me I had to go home when the child was born. After six months they wanted to check my daughter was healthy and it was only after that they said 'Oh by the way we have a family for her'. I said I'm not ready to give someone my child if they first want to see if she's developing at the normal rate and so on. At this time I was going to counselling and it made me a strong person: my wounds had healed, I was looking and feeling myself and I realised this child was part of me. It's difficult bringing her up but if I didn't have her I would have gone insane waiting for a decision from the Home Office. </p> <p>It's easy to say 'Oh asylum seekers have taken all the houses and so on', but the truth is that asylum seekers really suffer in the current system. When my case was heard in court, the judge agreed that I was tortured and gave me leave to remain on human-rights grounds. But the Home Office appealed against that decision. That was in 2004 and, until January this year, I was living in limbo, waiting to hear the outcome. Finally they gave me indefinite leave to remain.</p> <p>I got tired of sitting at home so I started looking for charities and it was through Women for Refugee Women that I met Natasha [Walter, who runs the charity]. I've been public speaking ever since, telling my story and telling the stories of other women who can't speak English. It felt like therapy as well: when there's a place where you can explode with anger and say 'why would the government do this?' it feels good afterwards, like I could breathe properly. Everyone asks me 'Oh my God Marjorie, how did you manage to deal with all these things?' I'd say the work I do with you keeps me busy. I've been to the House of Commons I don't know how many times. The first time was so scary but when I stood up and spoke, I looked around and everyone was nodding and I thought: oh my God, I have power. You can make me sign [for asylum seekers' financial support] 1,001 times a day [asylum seekers have to sign regularly to comply with Home Office regulations. Breach of signing requirements can result in detention] but you can't take my brains out of my head. I thought 'Way to go, woman!' Natasha tells me I'm amazing and I say 'I'm amazing because of you'. That makes me cry because if it wasn't for people like that I could not have had that power. I am so grateful to them. </p> <p>I'm putting in an application for my 10-year-old daughter to come here because my mother, her guardian, passed away. Looking forward to meeting her - that hope keeps me going. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.refugeewomen.com\">refugeewomen.com</a></p> <h2>Hollman Morris<br>40, Colombian journalist, winner of the 2007 human rights watch defender prize</h2> <p><strong>'I had to find out how people were slaughtered and nothing happened'</strong></p> <p>My seven-year-old daughter asked me a while ago 'Daddy, why do you only interview sad people?'

I knew from when I set out to be a journalist that my job was to show their stories. </p> <p>I first saw that need when I was a teenager watching the TV news and when they reported about a massacre in Segovia where 70 people were killed in one day (11 November 1988) and I thought 'Shit, what is that about?' and then a few hours later we were watching a national beauty contest. That defined my role as a journalist because I decided I had to find out how it could be in this country that people were being slaughtered and nothing happened. </p> <p>That has always meant problems for me with all the armed actors in the Colombian conflict. Since 1997 there have always been death threats from one group or another. But the most critical year of my life was between 2000 and 2001. A colleague who had been kidnapped and raped (by paramilitaries) said her captors had told her: 'Hollman Morris is next.' Around the same time my wife Patty told me she was pregnant. We fled to Spain with the help of an Amnesty International programme for human rights defenders because I was able to show my work from a human rights perspective.</p> <p>After a year we came back to Colombia. My options for work in Spain were to do menial tasks, be a parking lot attendant. So it was a choice between shooting myself [out of frustration] in Spain or I get shot doing what I love in Colombia. </p> <p>Our job as journalists is to look after people's rights. In a way we are the guardians of human rights. We may not be the activists who put out urgent action notices every day. But our work as journalists is to write, publish and denounce when there is a violation of any fundamental right. </p> <p>My generation has never seen a day of peace in Colombia. What I want is through journalism to try to build a better country for my children to live in so that they can live in peace.</p> <h2>Zmitser Dashkevich<br>27, leader of Youth Front, Belarus</h2> <p><strong>'I received hundreds of letters of support every day from all over the world'</strong></p> <p>I was arrested in September 2006 and charged with 'organising and participating in the activity of an unregistered non-governmental organisation'. After six weeks in detention and on trial I was sentenced to one-and-a-half years in prison.</p> <p>At that time I was leader of Youth Front, which is a Christian organisation of young people in Belarus. It is an independent political and social force which is in stark opposition to President Alexander Lukashenko, the last dictator in Europe. Lukashenko has openly praised Stalin and wants to turn our country back into the evil empire, the Soviet Union. We believe his politics are leading to the spiritual and moral degeneration of Belarussian society.</p> <p>On six occasions we have tried to register our organisation but every time our application was refused. In early 2006 Lukashenko became very worried in the run-up to presidential elections. He understood that he was losing his power because the younger generation - despite all the ideology and repression - did not support him. Young people are mostly pro-European and pro-democratic in outlook. We were holding protests against falsification of the vote. So he introduced a new article into the law making it illegal to participate in the activities of an unregistered organisation. I was the first to be prosecuted. </p> <p>After sentencing I was sent to prison. We slept in barracks and ate porridge and rotten meat. Very soon I started receiving hundreds of letters of support every day. They came from ordinary Belarussians, from Christian organisations and from members of human-rights groups from all over the world. These activists also sent thousands of letters to the government. And they sent lots of origami cranes - a symbol of freedom. I received some in prison. The censors checked my post and they unfolded the cranes to see if anything was inside. So I just received these creased, flattened-out pieces of coloured paper. But it was a powerful statement. </p> <p>The government had painted us oppositionists as a sad, marginal group on the payroll of the CIA. But when the prison guards saw all my letters, they said: 'Wow, the people are really behind this guy.' They started to understand the gap between the propaganda and reality. Even the administrators admitted the letters were proof of something big. It altered their outlook. As a direct result of the huge campaign of public solidarity I was released one-and-a-half months early and returned to lead Youth Front. We are still struggling against Lukashenko's regime but now they are too afraid to imprison people under the registration law. </p> <h2>Odette Mupenzi<br>31, victim of Rwandan genocide </h2> <p><strong>'I was very ill... I wanted to commit suicide. Now, I feel alive again'</strong></p> <p>I realised being a Tutsi was not considered good by some people when I was 11, because I had a teacher who picked on us, saying we had funny faces. Then in 1990 [the majority Hutus] killed many Tutsi intellectuals in a stadium near where I lived. After that, I knew we were in danger, but I didn't expect what was coming.</p> <p>In January 1994, my family stopped sleeping at home because we thought we would be taken away during the night. When the genocide began in April, we fled to a religious seminary. The next day, lots of people turned up with machetes, guns, spears and axes. </p> <p>Many of us hid in a classroom. They came to the door and my father opened it, because they threatened to burn the building down. When he did, I saw them cut him open. I was hiding under a mattress and they put a gun to my face and shot me. I could hear people praying, then there was silence - everyone was dead. The next thing I remember was waking up in hospital.</p> <p>I've been fighting for life ever since. In Rwanda, all they did was wash the wound. An NGO helped me get treatment in Switzerland, but they ran out of money. I went to Germany and the same thing happened.</p> <p>I first met the human-rights group Aegis Trust when it set up a genocide memorial in Kigali [in 2004]. I was very ill at the time - my bones were infected and I was living on morphine. </p> <p>In March 2006, I came to England. I've had metal bones put in my jaw, and skin taken from my side and put in my face. I don't think people at home would recognise me. I can eat with a spoon and fork and drink from a tap. I don't know how to explain how the trust has helped me - thank you isn't enough. When they met me, I wanted to commit suicide. Now, I feel alive again.</p> <p>To be honest, I don't want to go back to Rwanda. The war has stopped, but there are still troubles - survivors have been killed to stop them testifying against people. I just want to live in a country where I don't have to look over my shoulder all the time. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.aegistrust.org\">aegistrust.org</a></p> <h2>Ignatius Mahendra Kusuma Wardhana<br>25, Indonesian student activist </h2> <p><strong>'They put me in a cell. There were a lot of blood prints over the walls'</strong></p> <p>I was imprisoned when I was 20 due to my involvement in the National Student League for Democracy. In January 2003, the President brought in a new policy to increase fuel and electricity prices, so mass demonstrations took place across Indonesia. We held a demonstration in Jakarta and it ended with a performance in which we burnt pictures of the President and Vice President. The police surrounded us and one of my friends was captured. I was not arrested at this point because the police didn't have a warrant. But my friend was blindfolded and they threatened him, saying they would shoot him and throw his body in the sea. He told me all this afterwards - at the time we didn't realise that he was captured. </p> <p>When we went to the police station to find him, they gave me the warrant and arrested me. They interrogated me for about seven hours and a lot of the questions were not about the demonstration but about my organisation, who I was dealing with and so on. They put me in a cell that they called 'the tiger cage' because there was no bathroom in there; it's like when you're in the zoo and you see animals in a cage. It's a place where the police beat up prisoners too so there were a lot of blood prints over the walls. </p> <p>In every trial the President's supporter came and threatened me and my lawyer. Maybe my lawyer was not brave enough because at the sixth or seventh trial he backed down and gave up. I was in despair because I thought I had no other way out. In April 2003 I was sentenced to three years. I was put in a cell they called the dry cell because there is no water at all - they gave us a drink once a day. There was a prisoner who sort of ran the prison, a member of the President's party, who fought me every week. Well, it wasn't really a fight because they were about 20 people and I am only one. The prison officer knew what was going on but I guess he was given money.</p> <p>Amnesty International is familiar with the Indonesian movement and it made a greeting-card campaign, sending cards to me and to the Indonesian President. I counted more than 4,000 letters. They made me feel better and gave me hope but, most important, they meant that the prison officer was more careful with me. I was there for two years, seven months and three days: I counted every day but the most significant factor in keeping my spirits up was the campaign. When I got letters from children in the UK I just couldn't believe that they were aware of me and were doing something about it. </p> <p>Indonesia is in a transitional period right now and there is still a lot to do for human rights. The first thing I did when I was released was demonstrate outside the prison because even though we got a new President with the 2004 election, he has continued repressive policies against activists. Prison is a bad memory but I got a lot of experience and lessons from it. I'm going to study human rights and politics at York University in October and after that I will continue my organisation. This is what I live for, this struggle.</p>",
  "<p>Her books have shocked, titillated, appalled and delighted readers for more than a decade. She has been condemned as a self-obsessed, navel-gazing publicity hound, who represents all that has gone wrong with French fiction, and lionised as a courageous writer challenging social and creative taboos and suffering for her bravery. But never before has a work by Christine Angot, labelled the queen of 'auto-fiction', suffered the indignity of being judged boring.</p> <p>Angot's latest work - Le march\u00e9 des amants (The lover market) - recounts her recent relationship with a fading rapper, Bruno Beausire, more usually known by his lurid stage name, Doc Gyn\u00e9co. More than 300 pages long, liberally peppered with references to her lover's frustrated proclivity for sodomy, and featuring lengthy passages describing sex in a lift, discussions over whether or not to go for a coffee or who will call whom later, the book is the first of Angot's 14 works to be destroyed by the literary critics.</p> <p>'She has been lynched,' said Christophe Ono-dit-Biot, author and culture editor of Le Point magazine. 'It's very French. We build them up and then suddenly we decide to trample them into the dirt,' she explained.</p> <p>The attacks have undoubtedly been ferocious. Critic Christine Ferniot, writing in Lire magazine, described The Lover Market as 'dry, grey and boring... a B-series film with a Richard Clayderman soundtrack.' For J\u00e9rome Dupuis, in the weekly L'Express, the book was 'a long woolly text stuffed with inept conversations.'</p> <p>Though - or perhaps because - Doc Gyn\u00e9co controversially supported the right-wing President, Nicolas Sarkozy, in last year's election, the criticism has cut across political divides. An appalling review in the left-wing Le Nouvel Observateur was followed by worse in the influential intellectual Telerama listings magazine. Its critic described the book as a 'banal compilation of insignificant dialogues'.</p> <p>But for some observers the row is rooted more in the social tensions and prejudices of French society than in any literary flaws in Angot's latest work. The book's title is taken from one sentence - 'on the lover market, a black is worth less than a white'. Jean-Pierre Boul\u00e9, professor of contemporary French studies at Nottingham Trent University, said: 'The reaction has been so virulent because... what Angot, 49, is talking about is deeply shocking in the new conservative climate [in France].'</p> <p>Most of the polemics about the book have certainly focused on the relationship between Doc Gyn\u00e9co, who is from a poor suburban background, and the white middle-class writer. Some have even described it as a 'misalliance'.</p> <p>Her defenders point out that earlier books in which Angot described having sex respectively with her father, an elderly banker and figures from the cultural world have all been critically lauded.</p> <p>'It seems that this is one taboo that you can't transgress,' said Ono-dit-Biot. 'Doc Gyn\u00e9co himself is actually quite sympathetic, and though it might be a bit soppy the book is a rather nice love story. Angot's the girl from the good bourgeois family who ran off with the gardener. So she's been taken apart.'</p> <p>Angot refuses the title 'queen of auto-fiction', despite being described as such by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on its official website. But some have seen her fall from grace as a sign that 'auto-fiction', a largely French literary genre that consists of using one's own slightly disguised experience as a basis for a narrative in which fact and fiction are mixed without clear distinction, has had its day.</p> <p>One of the major successes of this autumn has been a book advertised explicitly as 'not auto-fiction', in which a character condemns the genre as being defined as 'the more I speak, the more I am right ... I speak and it's called a book'.</p> <p>The best-selling author Michel Houellebecq, whose last book and the film based on it were both panned, is the latest proponent of the genre to fall foul of the critics. But Philippe Lan\u00e7on, literary critic of Lib\u00e9ration newspaper, pointed out that a lengthy new work by author Catherine Millet, whose account of her adulterous sex sessions with multiple anonymous partners became a global bestseller six years ago, has been well received. Millet's new book, Day of Suffering, recounts her own jealousy within her marriage, her masturbatory fantasies and sessions with her psychologists.</p> <p>'The problem with Angot's latest is what she says, not how she says it, Lan\u00e7on told The Observer. 'Millet's latest is very stylised, much more educated. The reader is among educated people and it's much less shocking,' he said.</p> <p>This year's autumnal crop of literary offerings includes 676 novels, of which 210 are foreign translations. Stars include David Lodge's Deaf Sentence and Ian McEwan's On Chesil Beach, which was third on the French bestseller list last week.</p> <p>'They are the kind of books that the French are no longer producing: well-written, humorous, satirical with bite in the one case; beautiful storytelling that perfectly conjures a historical moment in the other,' said Boul\u00e9. 'There is a longing for such works.'</p>",
  "<p>It was Arthur Koestler, writing during the Second World War, after the existence of the camps became known, who first pointed out that there are limits to the human rights project. Those who described what was going on in places such as Auschwitz-Birkenau were obliged, Koestler lamented, to become 'Screamers'. The Screamers did succeed in reaching listeners, but only momentarily. 'You can convince them for an hour,' Koestler said, 'and their mental half-defence begins to work, and in a week the shrug of incredulity has returned.'</p> <p>For every brutally honest Koestler, however, there have always been others prepared to believe that humans are either basically good or susceptible to persuasion when it comes to saving the world. Frumpy, usually dressed in black, reviled by conservatives as much as she was revered by her progressive followers, Franklin Roosevelt's widow, Eleanor, was in 1948 the most famous woman in American public life. In her weekly radio shows she offered listeners an unceasing flow of upbeat liberal homilies. It was she who presented the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the General Assembly on a winter's day in 1948, in Paris. It's hard not to sense that this was a historic moment. She stresses that the document is not 'a statement of law and legal obligation'; but that it may well become 'the international Magna Carta of all men everywhere'. Most poignant is Eleanor's assertion that human rights are based on what she calls 'a spiritual fact'. Man must have freedom to develop his full stature, she states, 'and through common effort to raise the level of human dignity'.</p> <p>The declaration was one of a number of documents adopted by the newly created UN as part of the postwar effort to save humanity from further bloodshed. It is emphatically a document of its time, making no mention of many things that liberals would now regard as their inalienable rights - to express one's own sexuality by choosing partners of either sex in perfect freedom - and of course no mention of the death penalty and abortion.</p> <p>Much of the declaration reeks of the collectivist, welfarist consensus of the late 1940s. David Cameron and contemporary conservatives would find nothing to object to in its evocation of its importance of the family as the cornerstone of civilisation. Truly striking, however, are the guarantees of free speech, freedom to migrate (as crucial a right for refugees in the 1940s as it is for the world's migrants today), and the basic kit of political freedom that comprises what democrats value in the contemporary world. 'Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers' (Article 19). No one could have put it better, even after all these years of attempts to implement these principles.</p> <p>I wonder what Eleanor would make of our world. She would be astonished by the proliferation of treaties and declarations designed to further the cause, and she would certainly be encouraged by the arrival of a new international style of public life. No non-governmental organisations (NGOs) existed in her lifetime, and we can imagine her as a member of Amnesty or Human Rights Watch. But she might be shocked to discover that the undertakings made in the wake of the mid-century catastrophe hadn't borne much fruit. The killing fields are still open, though they may be more carefully hidden and on a smaller scale. What the poet Robert Lowell called 'the blind swipe of the pruner and his knife' still disturbs the Sabbath rest.</p> <p>In 1948 the Russians sent Andrei Vyshinsky, the judge who had presided over Stalin's show trials, to the UN. He declined to sign the Declaration, referring to it as 'just a collection of pious phrases.' In post-Communist Russia, journalists are killed with impunity. It is still possible to fight wars in the name of peace or human rights - on behalf of the beleaguered South Ossetians - but no one must pretend that this is the real reason for the conflict. Perhaps hypocrisy is on the wane. </p> <p>Meanwhile China has inscribed a commitment to human rights in its constitution. During the Olympics, acting under international pressure, the Chinese created a site in which its citizens might be given official permission to hold demonstrations. Two 70-year-old women wishing to protest that their flat had been torn down were given a year of 're-educative labour', though the sentence was suspended pending their good behaviour. I suppose this is a step forward from the Cultural Revolution in which more than a million Chinese were beaten up, tortured and killed in what historians now see as a bout of state-sponsored anarchy.</p> <p>But what of the Western idea of 'humanitarian intervention' - pioneered in Kosovo and repeated, with less conspicuous success, in Iraq. War was fought in the 1940s in order to save humanity, not to dispose of unwanted minor tyrants. Is it possible to impose democracy when the means involve violating human rights? Nothing in the traditional lexicon of human rights gives any guidance in such matters. </p> <p>As the neocons tell us, parts of the world appear bent on perfecting authoritarian systems. Because of their beliefs, Islamists can have no regard for secular rights. Just as worrying is the assertion (invariably made by those who wish to dispense with them, finding expression in many deeply shocking documents churned out by the UN) that human rights belong to the West, either a rich man's toy or a legacy of imperialists. </p> <p>My own worries are somewhat different. Human rights may simply be a last, ineffectual expression of Samaritanism in a post-Christian world in which suffering is commemorated but no one ever meets the victims. Trying to impose standards by means of pieces of paper which express high humanitarian aims may be what we do when we no longer have the power or the will to engage with the messiness of real politics. Put another way, human rights may merely be a way of appearing to save the world for those who don't want to try too hard to do so. </p> <p>Not long ago, I attended the annual Amnesty human-rights media awards. I've spent much of my career producing films in which atrocities are documented, but I was shocked by the procession of horrors. As one atrocious, unspeakable act after another was brought to light by means of images projected above our heads, it became hard to recall the many courageous journalists, film-makers and activists whose work was being celebrated. Articles about female foeticide were honoured, and there were films (I had indeed been involved with them) about Darfur and the dungeons of George Bush. Index on Censorship was awarded a prize for its expos\u00e9 of the murders of Russian journalists, crimes unpunished and greeted with indifference by the Russian elite. The most touching moment was the award in absentia of a prize to Abdul Karim al-Khaiwani, a Yemeni journalist jailed for 'insulting the President'. It seemed only appropriate that the prize should be given by the BBC's Alan Johnston, fresh from his own imprisonment in Gaza. </p> <p>Chardonnay is served on such occasions, and a glass was in my hand when I encountered a journalist friend from the BBC. He appeared chastened, anxious, and his thoughts mirrored mine. 'So much care goes into the making of these films, the writing of these articles. And people risk their lives,' he said. 'But does anyone actually watch them? Does anyone care?' </p> <p>For the past months, I've tried to answer this question, navigating my way around activists and theorists. I've found many eloquent defenders of human rights. But I notice, too, an impatience with the subject among those whom I interview. 'Yes we know that rights are important,' they wish to say, 'but do we always have to talk about them in a hand-wringing way? Can't we find better news about rights?' And I notice, too, a weary anger when it becomes apparent to both of us that, alas, the news will never be very good. Still, human rights can be exciting. Sir Geoffrey Nice, the man who spent four years of his life trying Slobodan Milosevic, carries the trial around on his laptop. Here is another intelligent human being with whom I can jointly define the nature of contemporary atrocity.</p> <p>But I meet optimists, too. The lawyer and author Geoffrey Robertson speaks out against obscurantists in his book Crimes Against Humanity with the eloquence and gusto of a north London Voltaire. 'There is much more awareness of human rights and we have made a start in enforcing them,' he tells me. In between visits to the Hague, where he's selecting judges for the UN tribunal, he outlines his pet project - a Convention Against Tyranny capable of giving legal justification in order to overthrow evildoers. </p> <p>'At present it would be confined to situations where genocide or widespread murder and torture are being inflicted by state agencies,' he says. 'But there are other forms of barbarism: the Taliban's denial of education to women and girls and execution of homosexuals. Mugabe's destruction of democracy and use of starvation and thuggery as political weapons. That is for the future.'</p> <p>If not beady-eyed, the redoubtable Irene Khan, secretary general of Amnesty, turns out to be nearly as positive. 'You have to think of the Europe of 1938,' she says. 'The biggest European country was ruled by a government that persecuted minorities, arranging \"disappearances\". That would be unthinkable now.' Khan points to all the treaties signed in the past 60 years. 'We don't need any more declarations about rights,' she says. 'The problem is implementation.' She describes to me a world in which a civil society involving millions globally is campaigning on behalf of rights only to find themselves frustrated by politicians. I tell her that I am only partly convinced by this. Politicians are conservative people, but there must be a reason why they are so reluctant to make a stand. </p> <p>We are all agreed, however, when it comes to evoking the damage wrought to the cause of human rights by the so-called war against terror. In the name of national security, America, viewed in 1945 as the sole beacon of a world in darkness, has attempted to re-establish torture as a legitimate method of interrogation, practising it on a substantial scale. Dozens of books chronicle the ineptitude with which the Bush administration stumbled into Iraq. The best is Jane Mayer's The Dark Side, a bestseller in the US. It has yet to find a publisher here. Dip into any chapter and you will find out about 'interrogation' in the new century:</p> <p><strong>'11:15</strong>: Told detainee dog is held in higher esteem... Began to teach detainee lessons such as stay, come and bark...</p> <p><strong>13:00</strong>: Dog tricks continue... Interrogator showed photos of 9-11 victims and told him he should bark happy for these people. Interrogator showed photos of al-Qaeda terrorist and told detainee he should growl at these people. A towel was placed on detainee's head like a burka, and interrogator proceeded to give detainee dance lessons.' </p> <p>The most convincing explanation for the Bush debacle comes from a former top Bush administration lawyer who Mayer quotes. The lawyer, Philip Zelikow, tells her, 'Fear and anxiety were exploited by zealots and fools.' Americans were ready to go along with torture as long as it was called something else. So the lawyers who betrayed America were responding to something more than a public mood. But can we really suppose that these emotions are uniquely American, and that any country, confronted with what is perceived as a threat to its security, won't go the same way? Why should the dark side not prove a common destination in the new century? 'American ideals are undercut by torture. It makes nonsense of our constitutional protections and our claims that all humans have inalienable rights under the law,' Mayer says. 'It hurts the rest of the world, too - because when America forsakes its role as a defender of human rights, it gives licence to tyrannies everywhere.'</p> <p>British governments, too, have been swayed by fear and anxiety. As junior allies we're complicit in what the law lord Johan Steyn called 'the legal black hole of Guant\u00e1namo.' As Conor Gearty, professor of law at the London School of Economics, points out, Anglo-American linkage of human rights and the war against terror has tried to turn them 'into a basis for selective aggression abroad and an alibi for brutality at home'.</p> <p>Another optimist (and international lawyer), Philippe Sands, urges me to take a long view of human rights. He says that rights are the only riposte to the notion, enshrined in European law for centuries, that the state and its representatives have unlimited powers. We should not expect that doctrines adhered to for so long can be overthrown in a year or a decade. Sands was involved in the Pinochet case. He sees the detention of the Chilean dictator as the moment when it was established that for 'crimes against humanity' there should be no frontiers. The law lords did decide that the dictator had a case to answer - not in the country in which the crimes were committed, but where the prosecution was initiated. Home Secretary Jack Straw did return Pinochet to Chile, but the decision was made on health grounds.</p> <p>And yet superpowers do still act to protect themselves, invoking sovereignty. America posed throughout the Cold War as the world's defender of freedoms - but things were different when US citizens might conceivably find themselves prosecuted under international law. Like the Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on Genocide was signed in 1948, after a long, single-handed campaign by Rafael Lemkin, a Polish refugee settled in New York. However, the US Senate declined to ratify the document. Each day the Senate was in session, for 19 years, Senator William Proxmire got to his feet and made a four-minute speech condemning genocide. But it took the charm of Ronald Reagan (and presumably the death of most of the remaining concentration-camp guards in exile somewhere in America) to persuade senators to overcome their objections.</p> <p>As Samantha Power shows in her history of genocide, A Problem from Hell, America proved to be reluctant when it came to preventing genocide. Invariably, it was decided that vital interests were not at stake in the poor, remote countries where killings took place. Officials could then say that it was too late to do anything. Afterwards came the moment to say that it should never happen again. This is what happened in Bosnia, and, most horrifyingly, in Rwanda. With Obama or McCain President, the camps in Guant\u00e1namo will finally be emptied and closed down. But can we expect to see American troops freely used to prevent genocide in places like Darfur? I somehow don't think so.</p> <p>The most important NGO active in human rights remains Amnesty International. It was launched in the pages of this newspaper in 1961 by a London lawyer and a group of fellow liberals. 'The newspaper reader feels a sickening sense of impotence,' Peter Benenson began. Amnesty would seek to adopt individual 'prisoners of conscience', writing letters to the governments which had incarcerated them or encouraging others to do so. </p> <p>Amnesty's aims were carefully limited, and the prisoners adopted came from the West as well as the Communist bloc and the developing world. (Those who advocated violence were not selected, and Amnesty felt ambivalent about Nelson Mandela, first adopting and then rejecting him when he was found guilty of sabotage, although they did acknowledge that people like him might 'feel or find themselves forced into a position in which the only road to freedom is violence...'). Soon letters poured in from a new breed of human-rights activist. Numberless teenagers (myself included) formed Amnesty cells at school. The approach of carefully selecting prisoners, restricting Amnesty's aims, appeared satisfactory.</p> <p>But times changed, and during the 1970s it became possible for Western governments to raise human-rights questions with their Soviet bloc counterparts. In consequence human rights were no longer the sole property of NGOs. As the scope of campaigning increased, those who practised it became more aggressive. In danger of being overtaken by its rivals, Amnesty did move with the times. But it was not until 2003, under Khan's stewardship, that its charter was substantially revised. Amnesty now runs campaigns in relation to the fullest range of 'economic and social rights'. Khan is proud of the recent Stop Violence Against Women in which rape, honour killings, domestic violence and clitoridectomy were targeted.</p> <p>Traditionalists criticised the changes, suggesting that this would make Amnesty indistinguishable from other liberal NGOs. They were upset by the professionalisation of what appeared to be an institution set in its ways. Spread over many floors and located to the east of the city in Shoreditch, as clean-lined as a newly completed city academy, the new Amnesty headquarters is a daunting place, with activists beavering away on each floor. It's hard not to be impressed by so much seriousness. But I find myself surprised, too, by the jolliness of so many working there. Can they really spend each day trying to nudge the immobile Home Office into treating asylum seekers just a little better? Can they remain motivated over the long slog required to get the UN to create some sort of document aimed at limiting the social ravages caused globally by the arms trade? It would appear that somehow they do, though I realise that I would find such diligence testing. </p> <p>However, it's hard here to evade the central contradiction of Amnesty, which is that of the human-rights movement itself. Amnesty still exists by placing in the public eye what, in perfect earnestness, it aims to put an end to. As an institution Amnesty is dedicated to unceasing, endless struggle. I ask a researcher whether the work doesn't get to her. 'Sometimes it does,' says simply. 'But there are compensations.'</p> <p>I can find an echo of such feelings in my own experience. My way into the human-rights maze came via a trap door labelled Srebrenica. A Cry From the Grave is a film which gives an exhaustive, minute-by-minute account of the massacre of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys in 1995. The director, Leslie Woodhead, says, 'Like the crimes committed, it won't go away. You can see a version of it now in the town's museum, where the massacre is commemorated.' </p> <p>Geoffrey Nice was the prosecutor in the four-year trial of Slobodan Milosevic at the Yugoslav tribunal in The Hague, and I ask him what he now thinks of the experience. Did he feel cheated when Milosevic died before the proceedings were completed? Lanky, hyperarticulate, Nice is frank and uncomplicated when it comes to admitting that the system is far from perfect. 'It would have been good to secure a conviction, and obviously I wanted one,' he says. 'But the record stands. Anyone who wants to re-establish the reputation of Milosevic will have to contend with what we found out.' But Nice proves to have complex views about prosecuting war criminals. He senses that it is time to abandon the all-out model of Nuremberg, in which a verdict is also a political statement of sorts. We should come to regard international courts as normal, uncontroversial. If it isn't always possible to secure convictions (or indeed to try people, because political considerations make that impossible), maybe we shouldn't worry too much.</p> <p>Only a few years ago Henry Kissinger was shocked when he was presented, via the manager of the Ritz Hotel in Paris, with a legal document asking for his help in sorting out aspects of the Pinochet-era killings in Chile. Unsuccessful attempts have been made in a German court to indict Donald Rumsfeld. I don't think Rumsfeld, or indeed George W Bush, have anything to worry about, even if they do take their holidays in Europe. But in The Hague a few weeks ago, you could choose to see a freshly shaved, suited ex-New Age guru and former Prime Minister of the Republika Srpska Radovan Karadzic appear in court, declining to enter a plea, or watch Charles Taylor, the ex-President of Liberia, fumble with his papers as he watched another witness give an account of his role in the horrifying 10-year civil war. The courtrooms are heavily protected with giant, aquarium-like windows. They're unpicturesquely located in buildings that resemble the headquarters of waste-disposal companies. However, in their anonymity, they are deeply moving places, expressing a determination that impunity should be punished.</p> <p>Many years in the creation, the new International Criminal Court (ICC) was backed by Clinton and melodramatically 'unsigned' by George Bush. Bizarre regulations restrict those who can be tried there to citizens of signatory countries, or cases approved by the UN Security Council. (This means that no Russian, Chinese or American war criminal will ever be brought before the court; indeed the court has been criticised for targeting exclusively offenders from Africa, thus appearing the instrument of neo-imperialism.) But Nice hopes that the US may one day change its mind. 'The real problem with international law is how hard it is to keep independent of politics,' he says. 'Imagine you are running the court, choosing which cases to prosecute. There are war crimes committed everywhere. How do you know which ones to choose? It doesn't mean that you mustn't choose, but it's difficult.'</p> <p>In Albert Camus's short, stinging monologue The Fall (1956), Jean-Baptiste Clamence, a seedy, drunk lawyer, buttonholes a reluctant listener in an Amsterdam bar. On first reading, the book appears to be a perfect-pitch rendering of the worst, smarmiest French intellectual, a man whom vanity impelled towards the humanitarian racket and for whom not believing has become synonymous with honesty. 'It is so late,' Camus's cynic tells his interlocutor as he strives to avoid falling into a canal. 'One is always too late.' Latterly, however, I've begun to appreciate the text in a different fashion. Depressed when he wrote The Fall, Camus began to ask himself a simple question. What would happen to us all if, while, pretending that the lives of others mattered, we ceased to act as if they did? The answer is that we would, like Camus's ex-judge, no longer think of ourselves as human beings. </p> <p>Inevitably the human-rights narrative comes readily peopled with good victims and evil perpetrators. It abounds in worthy clich\u00e9s. My own plea is that in films or articles, human rights politics should be depicted like anything else - not in black and white, as slogans or in pop lyrics, but with the right component of muted, real-life greys. Think of the unassuming, wholly remarkable Canadian Rom\u00e9o Dallaire, who commanded the ill-fated UN force in Rwanda and refused to leave the country. Years later he was found drunk and weeping on a park bench. It appears that Dallaire never recovered from his experiences in Rwanda, though he was always ready to say that his own sufferings were nothing beside the ones he had witnessed. But Dallaire's sense of guilt and complicity proved embarrassing to the media covering his story. For reasons that were never discussed, he never seemed an appropriate protagonist.</p> <p>I also feel that human-rights activists should no longer be sniffy about what Irene Khan calls 'principled pragmatism'. This was the message of Sergio Vieira de Mello, a student of Camus and existentialist philosophy, and the most effective, most dedicated fighter for rights in our time. Brazilian, the son of a diplomat, Sergio began his UN career with a belief that laws and resolutions alone would stop the killing. Speedily disabused, despising the ponderous UN bureaucracy in which he needed to survive, he went to the opposite extreme of seeking to conciliate killers, in the forlorn hope of getting them to behave better. However, it would seem that Sergio's view of the world, too, was altered by Srebrenica. Appointed to the despised, underfunded post of UN Commissioner for Human Rights, he began to read feverishly. </p> <p>He began to see that human rights, far from being an optional extra, to be discarded when they weren't useful, were essential. They were the new global 'rule of law'. Abstractions such as peace and security made sense only if states treated their citizens properly - and were prepared to extend such rights to the citizens of other states. But he also thought that human-rights culture had wrongly neglected the notion of dignity. Freedoms meant nothing if people could have no sense of their own worth. And maybe flawed states with a minimum of democratic practices but some legal rights were better than the pseudo-democracies magicked into existence by an overeager West in the post-communist perception that history had ended. In East Timor, where he ran the UN mission, he was able to put these views into practice, with success.</p> <p>Sergio refused to criticise the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Alone among humanitarians, he was able to meet with George Bush and criticise the American treatment of detainees. He went to Baghdad in the certain expectation that his UN mission would prove to be a failure. On 19 August 2003 he died after a car bomb exploded, turning the UN headquarters into rubble. Charismatic, sexually attractive, Sergio enjoyed life and had no taste for martyrdom - he was just doing what had to be done. He died, as his biographer Samantha Power says, 'buried beneath the weight of the UN itself'. </p> <p>Sergio's last words, spoken to a rescuer eager to give him spiritual comfort, were: 'Fuck God, just get me out of here.' Human rights are indeed a matter of life and death. I can't think of a better slogan for our times than Sergio's.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> To read an edited version of the 1961 Observer article by Peter Benenson that launched Amnesty, go to <a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/52o6eu\">tinyurl.com/52o6eu</a></p> <h2>The United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights</h2> <p>This is an edited version of the rights enshrined in the 1948 declaration's 30 Articles</p> <p><strong>All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.</p> <p><strong>No one shall be held in slavery or servitude.</strong></p> <p>No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p> <p><strong>Everyone is equal before the law.</strong></p> <p>No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.</p> <p><strong>Everyone is entitled to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal in the [event] of any criminal charge against him.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right to privacy and to protection by the law from attacks upon his honour and reputation.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to seek asylum from persecution.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right to a nationality.</strong></p> <p>Men and women, irrespective of race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and found a family.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right to own property.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.</p> <p><strong>No one may be compelled to belong to an association.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right of equal access to public service in his country.</strong></p> <p>The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government.

  "<p>A suitcase filled with $800,000 in cash has embroiled Venezuela's President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in a scandal which has fuelled claims of corruption and cover-up at the heart of his self-styled socialist revolution.</p> <p>A court case involving wiretaps and explosive testimony has lifted the lid on alleged attempts to buy influence across Latin America, putting Ch\u00e1vez on the defensive during a torrid week of coup rumours and expulsions of human rights critics and the US ambassador.</p> <p>Tumbling oil prices compounded the anxiety in Caracas, which is almost wholly reliant on oil revenues, and prompted the President to warn that the government would rein in its free-spending ways.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez's most immediate headache came from a federal court in Miami which heard that Venezuela tried to funnel slush money to Argentina's President, Cristina Kirchner, for her successful election campaign last year. The Presidents denounced the story, which has been front-page news in both countries, as a 'garbage' attempt by Washington to smear South America's so-called 'pink tide' of left-wing leaders.</p> <p>The story broke in August 2007 when an aircraft chartered by Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Pdvsa, landed in Buenos Aires and a customs official discovered a Venezuelan-American businessman, Guido Antonini, wheeling a suitcase containing $800,000 (\u00a3436,441). Antonini fled to Miami, where he collaborated with the FBI and said the money was clandestine funding for Kirchner's election. It is alleged that Venezuelan agents, under orders from Ch\u00e1vez and his intelligence chief, General Henry Rangel Silva, tried to buy the businessman's silence with $2m. But Antonini was wearing an FBI wire and four of the men were arrested in Miami.</p> <p>At the trial of one of them, Franklin Dur\u00e1n, who is accused of conspiracy and acting as an unauthorised agent of a foreign government, a jury heard recordings, running to 155 pages of transcripts, of the alleged plot and cover-up.</p> <p>In addition to funding his Argentine ally, it is claimed Ch\u00e1vez, raiding the bulging vaults of the state oil company, paid other governments to back Venezuela's unsuccessful bid for a UN Security Council seat in 2006. The secretly recorded conversations' breezy references to greed and shadowy deals in Ch\u00e1vez's administration have been cited by Venezuela's opposition as proof of high-level corruption. The case has been dubbed 'Maletagate', after the Spanish word for suitcase, maleta</p> <p>The unusual nature of the FBI sting and prosecution's charges prompted widespread suspicion that the trial is politicised. It has embarrassed Washington's regional rival and could wreak further damage when Antonini, the bagman, takes the stand. Ch\u00e1vez has already denounced him as a traitor.</p> <p>The revelations from Miami fed a febrile atmosphere in Caracas, which has had a dramatic 10 days. Last Thursday the government expelled two senior members from Human Rights Watch, the New York-based advocacy group, hours after they presented a damning report of Ch\u00e1vez's decade in power. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco and Daniel Wilkinson were intercepted at their hotel, escorted to the airport and put on the first outward bound flight, which was to Brazil.</p> <p>'This is further evidence of Venezuela's descent into intolerance,' said Kenneth Roth, the group's executive director. 'Ch\u00e1vez may have kicked out the messenger, but he has only reinforced the message - civil liberties in Venezuela are under attack.'</p> <p>The government accused Human Rights Watch of lying, violating visa requirements and being a front for US imperialism. Other foreign critics who committed the same offences would also be expelled, it said. 'These groups, dressed up as human rights defenders, are financed by the United States,' said the Foreign Minister, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. 'They are aligned with a policy of attacking countries that are building new economic models.'</p> <p>The move followed the banishing of the US ambassador, Patrick Duddy, for backing an alleged coup plot, prompting Washington to expel Venezuela's ambassador, Bernardo Alvarez. A similar pattern unfolded in Bolivia where President Evo Morales, a Ch\u00e1vez ally, ousted the US envoy for allegedly conspiring with the opposition to break up the country.</p> <p>Venezuelan state TV aired intercepted recordings of Venezuelan military officers apparently discussing the President's overthrow. Several were detained.</p> <p>British Ch\u00e1vez supporters picketed the US embassy in London and warned of a CIA-backed coup similar to that which toppled Salvador Allende in 1973. 'It will go to the lengths it did in Chile and will drown the revolution in blood if it gets the opportunity,' said Jeremy Dear, general secretary of the National Union of Journalists.</p> <p>The Bush administration tacitly backed a coup against Ch\u00e1vez in 2002. Since then Venezuela's leader claims to have foiled numerous similar plots. But with few details, some analysts have become sceptical.</p> <p>The latest Bolivian and Venezuelan coup claims were ploys, said Adam Isacson, of the Centre for International Policy, a Washington-based think-tank. 'Don't believe for a moment that either expulsion had anything to do with an imminent danger of aggression from a waning US administration already in way over its head in the Middle East and with Russia. We have here two leaders badly in need of an external threat to rally their domestic bases.'</p> <p>Relations with the US are set to sour further this week when Ch\u00e1vez flies to Moscow to seek fresh weapon purchases and confirm details of a visit by Russian warships to the Caribbean.</p>",
  "<p>At the heart of London's Docklands, once a mouldering reminder of Britain's history as a great trading nation and now a gleaming glass and steel symbol of the might of global finance, the Canary Wharf offices of American investment bank Lehman Brothers - a name few people would have been aware of until a week ago - has suddenly become a stop on the tourist trail. A group of business people over from China on a training course have stopped to stare and have their photographs taken.</p> <p>'It is very shocking. We are here and it is very dramatic,' says a young woman among them, but she is interrupted by a Lehman security guard who charges over. 'You can't take photographs here, bloody gawpers!' he says. The group race off immediately, heads down, and the guard turns back muttering about their lack of respect for other people's misery.</p> <p>In New York, too, the 'gawpers' thronged to Lehman's headquarters in their hundreds to watch history unfold. On both sides of the Atlantic throughout the past tumultuous week, from Lehman's catastrophic collapse on Sunday night to US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson's promise on Friday to spend 'hundreds of billions of dollars' of American taxpayers' money to ride to the rescue of the banks, there was a profound sense of world-changing events unfolding at breakneck speed.</p> <p>Exuberant investors may have piled back into the stock markets on Friday, welcoming Paulson's mooted corporate aid package, but few believed anything would ever be the same again. Behind the anguished yells of disorientated City traders watching the markets oscillate from depression to mania and back again, and the macho insistence by Gordon Brown that he was in control of the crisis, something else was audible throughout - the sound of long-cherished truths being smashed to smithereens.</p> <p>Financiers in New York and London's Square Mile have enjoyed an extraordinary decade of global dominance, blowing unthinkable sums on yachts, racehorses and fine wines. Not only did they convince themselves of their own invincibility, but their glamour and sheer wealth blinded politicians into believing the alluring myths of the unfettered market.</p> <p>For Brown, who made it his mission from the early 1990s to woo London's money men, the reward for making sure regulators had a light touch and that taxes were low was a decade of turbo-charged growth, and the right to boast that the economic cycle of boom and bust was over.</p> <p>But while the banks were chalking up impressive profits, and driving growth, they were spoon-feeding Britain's consumers on a rich diet of cheap credit, which they gladly swallowed. The UK piled up the biggest debts in the G7 group of industrialised nations, sending up the price of homes from Cornwall to the Highlands of Scotland. Far from exercising Brown's cardinal virtue of prudence, consumers were saving less than at any time since the 1950s.</p> <p>The events of the past week may have played out among the larger-than-life characters of Wall Street, but on a smaller scale here at home they have finally slammed down the shutters on the era of cheap credit. For Britain's buy-now-pay-later, shop-till-you-drop economy, a mighty reckoning is now in store.</p> <p>For the staff of the investment bank Lehman Brothers, the reckoning came fast, last Monday morning. Glued to their BlackBerries all weekend for the latest news, they had pinned their hopes on a Sunday announcement of a government-brokered rescue, like the one Paulson clinched for Bear Stearns, then America's fifth-biggest investment bank, in March. But this time it was different. Dick Fuld, Lehman's abrasive chief, had stubbornly refused to countenance a series of offers to sell parts of his battered business, and Paulson thought he - and Wall Street - deserved to be taught a lesson.</p> <p>Lehman, he decided, must be left to sink or swim. 'He was effectively trying to identify \"insider money\" and \"outsider money\",' says Russell Jones, chief strategist at investment firm RBC Capital Markets. 'He was saying, \"Where an institution affects Main Street [outsider money], we'll save it; but where it only affects Wall Street [insider money], we won't\".'</p> <p>Barclays was one potential buyer for Lehman, and the head of Barclays Capital, Bob Diamond, flew out to New York to try to cut a deal. Paulson, however, refused to stump up any public cash to help rescue the 158-year-old institution - and the regulators back in London informed Diamond that they would need rock-solid assurances that bringing Lehman, with its billions of dollars of 'toxic' mortgage assets, under the wing of a British bank would not endanger the stability of the UK's financial system. Diamond walked away.</p> <p>Just before midnight on Sunday, its last chance exhausted, Fuld filed for bankruptcy, bringing down the curtain on an illustrious Wall Street dynasty - and rocking the financial world to its core.</p> <p>Back in London, where Chancellor Alistair Darling was in regular contact with Paulson, the prospect of such a high-profile casualty immediately set warning lights flashing. Lehman employed 5,000 staff in the UK at its swish Canary Wharf headquarters, whose jobs and livelihoods would be at risk; but Darling, and Financial Services Authority chairman Callum McCarthy knew that its collapse could ripple far beyond Docklands, to threaten the stability of Britain's entire banking system.</p> <p>Last Monday morning, as Lehman staff left Canary Wharf with boxes full of belongings, Darling held a fraught phone conference with McCarthy and Gordon Brown to discuss the risk that Lehman's collapse could so alarm investors that it would destabilise banks. Already, HBOS - which had tried and failed to raise \u00a34bn of cash from its shareholders in June - was in their sights. Later that day, Treasury officials, led by Darling's senior fixer Tom Scholar, began talking to HBOS about its future.</p> <p>Lloyds TSB, which had been hit less hard by the credit crunch than many of its rivals, first approached HBOS's ebullient boss, Andy Hornby, back in July. Despite the bungled fundraising, Hornby, once in charge of the George clothing range at Asda and a protege of retail millionaire and former Tory MP Archie Norman, was still determined he could go it alone.</p> <p>But the events of last Monday changed everything. As if Lehman's unseemly demise was not enough for the world's shocked investors to digest, Merrill Lynch, another mighty Wall Street broker brought low by rash bets on American mortgages, was swallowed up by its rival, Bank of America, in a hasty $50bn deal.</p> <p>Takeovers are hardly rare in banking; but for two such venerable Wall Street brands to disappear from the corporate jungle in a single day induced an alarming sense of vertigo among even the most hard-bitten investors.</p> <p>Economists call it 'contagion': the process by which the violent swings of mood caused by dramatic events in one financial market can rapidly spread around today's globalised world. From Moscow to Sydney, Paris to Beijing, investors dumped shares, wiping billions of dollars off the value of the world's companies, and poured cash into the traditional 'safe haven' asset of gold.</p> <p>On cable TV financial channel Bloomberg News on Monday night, usually the purveyor of bone-dry financial statistics, a ticker whizzed across the bottom of the screen that read 'Lehman staff clear desks, call headhunters, weep'.</p> <p>In the UK, all bank shares were pummelled, as investors began to think the unthinkable; but HBOS, long known to be woefully exposed to the shaky British property market, was most at risk. Its share price dropped by 18 per cent on Monday alone.</p> <p>That evening, Gordon Brown cornered Lloyds chairman Victor Blank at a party. Brown knew that if Lloyds was to succeed in rescuing HBOS, the government would have to throw its weight behind the deal by waiving competition rules.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning, Darling, McCarthy and Bank of England governor Mervyn King gathered at Number 11 Downing Street to review the unfolding crisis; and decided HBOS directors must be told that 'soldiering on wouldn't do'. The sense of crisis was heightened later that same day, when Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, announced he would use $85bn (\u00a346bn) of public funds to make an emergency loan to the American insurer AIG, the world's biggest - and sponsor of Manchester United.</p> <p>Under its charismatic former boss Hank Greenberg, AIG had transformed itself from an old-fashioned insurer into a whizzy financial player with a spider's web of complex bets, and it was now facing massive losses as a result of the Lehman collapse.</p> <p>Bernanke, who forged his reputation as an economics professor studying the catalogue of mistakes that turned the Wall Street crash of 1929 into the decade-long Great Depression, feared that allowing AIG to follow Lehman into the bankruptcy courts would leave its clients throughout the banking world dangerously vulnerable, and put the health of the whole financial system at risk.</p> <p>In London, meanwhile, there was rising concern that if talks between Lloyds and HBOS were not concluded fast, savers would begin queuing outside Halifax branches to withdraw their savings. Already, other banks had begun to withdraw some of their funds, the first sign that a run on the bank could be in the offing.</p> <p>The humiliating run on Northern Rock a year ago is seared into the government's collective memory. It was the most public evidence of a government losing control of Britain's economy since Norman Lamont had to stumble on to the steps of the Treasury on what became known as Black Wednesday, in 1992, to announce the pound's unceremonious departure from the European exchange rate mechanism.</p> <p>After 'the run on the Rock', as it became known, Richard Lambert, director-general of the CBI, said that 'outside the movies, a run on a bank is something that happens in a banana republic. That one should have happened, under our noses, in a mature and prosperous country like the UK, is almost unimaginable.'</p> <p>Brown was determined not to allow another run on his watch. On Wednesday morning, the Financial Services Authority issued a statement insisting that HBOS was 'a well-capitalised bank that continues to fund its business in a satisfactory way'; but by then, Blank, together with his chief executive Eric Daniels, was close to finalising a deal with Hornby.</p> <p>By Wednesday night, the \u00a310bn deal was done, and the Halifax, well-known to savers for its cheerful ads starring Howard the singing bank clerk, and the 300-year-old Bank of Scotland had been trampled under the thundering hooves of Lloyds' black horse. The credit crunch, once a distant drama played out on Wall Street, had well and truly come home to Britain's shores.</p> <p>On Thursday morning, a shattered-looking Hornby joined Daniels at a press conference in London to reveal the details of the deal. US-born Daniels gleefully announced that he would create a 'great British bank,' and promised to slash at least 10 per cent of costs as a result of the merger, implying that at least a tenth of the combined 140,000 staff facethe threat of redundancy - a fact not lost on Alistair Darling, who represents many of them in his Edinburgh South West constituency.</p> <p>While the HBOS takeover allowed investors in Britain to catch their breath, in the US the fallout from Lehman's collapse was spreading. Speculation was mounting about the health of the only two independent Wall Street brokers left standing - Morgan Stanley and the mighty Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>Morgan's boss John Mack, known as 'Mack the Knife' for his ruthless management style, was incandescent, complaining that speculators, in 'a market controlled by fear and rumour', were shorting Morgan's share price. But at the same time he began to talk to potential buyers, including the Chinese government, fearing Morgan might need to be rescued. There could hardly be a more potent illustration of the leaching of economic power east, from New York, to Beijing, Bangalore and Dubai, than these global titans scurrying to find a merger partner from China.</p> <p>On Thursday lunchtime in London's Bishopsgate, vendor Lorraine Cross, 57, was unlocking her news-stand, ready for the first edition of the Evening Standard. As the delivery of the first edition arrived, she pulled off the top sheet and exclaimed at the headline: 'God, look at this, Goldmans now!'</p> <p>A young American woman in a tan leather coat grabbed at the paper with trembling hands. 'That's my husband's firm, that's my husband,' she told Cross. She was led away by a friend, close to tears. 'Poor girl,' said Cross, 'but I have been here 36 years and I have been here for three lots of these big crises and it'll pick up again, it always does.'</p> <p>Her colleague Steve Jackson, 63, agreed. 'We've got no pensions and I had a letter the other day saying my endowment would be falling short and so I don't have a whole lot of sympathy for these flash boys playing with other people's lives just to buy their \u00a3400 bottles of wine and the rest.'</p> <p>For a group of builders taking a breather, it was clear that the effects of the financial meltdown would spread way beyond the Square Mile. 'It's bloody capitalism: the rich get richer and the rest of us pick up the pieces,' said Barry Solace, 38, from Greenwich. 'It's all negligence to have got into this state with so much money that they don't even know how to find it, never mind count it.' His colleague Ben Anderson nodded his head towards the building work behind them. 'It's a knock-on effect, isn't it? There were 10 contracts up in this area for building work and three have been cancelled. And when the work goes our jobs go, we're sacked, no pension, no big bonuses for us, nothing. It's always the same, the lower down the ladder you are, the worse off you are. The guys with the big bonuses might be losing a bit now, but they're already well set up.'</p> <p>Like the builders who have missed out on City contracts, some of the victims of last week's events are immediately visible: the hotdog sellers on Wall Street complaining about lack of business; the waitress in the champagne bar at Bishopsgate who raises an eyebrow when asked how many bottles of champagne she's sold. But there are many less visible victims, hit by the credit squeeze sucking funds back towards the embattled banks, as they scramble to get their finances in order.</p> <p>As the week went on, it became increasingly obvious that without more help one financial firm after another would fall victim to the vicious spiral of fear and greed that had brought down Lehman. So concerned did the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic become about the dizzy swings of the markets that they slapped a temporary ban on the short-selling of financial stocks, to prevent the share prices of any more banks falling off a cliff.</p> <p>And on Friday morning, Paulson finally went for the nuclear option, unveiling an audacious plan for Washington to spend 'hundreds of billions of dollars' of taxpayers' money on buying up the hard-to-value assets held by US banks, gathering them into a so-called 'bad bank', freeing their erstwhile owners to get back to business usual. The markets reacted jubilantly - in London, the FTSE 100 made its biggest ever one-day gain.</p> <p>Spending public cash to rescue the banks will be hugely controversial, and could leave America's taxpayers with hefty bills for years to come. But on Friday Paulson declared: 'I am convinced that this bold approach will cost American families far less than the alternative - a continuing series of financial institution failures and frozen credit markets unable to fund economic expansion.'</p> <p>And it's that great fear which has been at the hub of politicians' concerns throughout this crisis: how will the struggles of the banks hit Main Street - or Acacia Avenue?</p> <p>Long after the dust has settled on the past seven nerve-shredding days, the economic hangover from the credit boom will still be felt. Already, house prices in the UK have fallen by 10 per cent, economic growth has stalled and more than 100,000 jobs have been lost. But most analysts believe that we are slipping into at least a year of sickly economic growth, and it may be 2010 before any signs of a genuine recovery are visible.</p> <p>The US has already been in the grip of a housing crash for more than two years; but while prices continue to fall, and a growing number of poor homeowners default on their loans, the value of the complex mortgage-backed assets in banks' portfolios has continued to plummet. Banks have responded by tightening the loan taps in an effort to get their finances back in order; which in turn makes it harder to get a new mortgage, and accelerates the fall in house prices, which have already dropped by close to 20 per cent.</p> <p>Paulson and Bernanke hope last week's dramatic intervention will finally act as a circuit-breaker in this pernicious financial storm, which has already brought down some of Wall Street's biggest names - and swept thousands of the poorest Americans out of their homes. British banks will not be able to offload their toxic assets into Paulson's new 'bad bank', but the government hopes that the US moves will at least restore a sense of calm. 'It should draw most of the poison out of the system,' said one regulator this weekend.</p> <p>For the time being at least, Gordon Brown may just have become that rare commodity, a Prime Minister actually saved - rather than destroyed - by an economic catastrophe.</p> <p>When the resignation of Scottish minister David Cairns, with his potentially devastating admission that he could not in all conscience pretend he thought Brown could win an election, was relegated to the inside pages of Wednesday's newspapers by turmoil in the markets it became clear to Labour rebels that now was not the time to rise up against their leader.</p> <p>One minister who shares their despair at the government's plight said none the less that the City crisis had now made a truce essential: 'It's not that people will say, \"Gordon's the best man to deal with this\", because the public perception is that he was the Chancellor and completely identified with the economic policies that have got us here. It's that we will not look credible or responsible if while this such a crisis is ensuing we are engaging in internal warfare.'</p> <p>Labour MPs are already clamouring for a root-and-branch review of City regulation, further clampdowns on what the SNP leader Alex Salmond called the 'spivs and speculators' bringing banks to their knees, even curbs on City bonuses to limit risky activity - a call endorsed by none other than Labour chairman Harriet Harman, who made fat-cat pay part of her campaign for the deputy leadership on Friday.</p> <p>The Chancellor, who will address the party conference tomorrow, is under pressure to respond, and Treasury officials are hurriedly drawing up plans for a radical overhaul of financial regulation.</p> <p>But John McFall, the Labour chairman of the Commons Treasury select committee, warned that ministers should concentrate on sorting out the current crisis rather than being panicked into responding. 'I think there has to be a post mortem. The primary task is to get the financial community out of the gigantic hole into which they have put themselves. That is hugely important, and then after that is achieved we can have time to look at what undoubtedly needs to change.'</p> <p>The Tories' traditionally deregulatory instincts, meanwhile, have been shaken by the new political reality of millions of swing voters in Middle England angrily contemplating the wreckage of their pensions, share portfolios and - in some cases - careers. They are in no mood to hear, as the former Bank governor Eddie George suggested in a pamphlet for the Tory think-tank Politeia last week, that the City itself is better placed than the government to sort out its problems.</p> <p>Shadow chancellor George Osborne is demanding new powers for the Bank of England to intervene in the markets and greater protection for savers, to prevent panicking customers staging runs on another bank.</p> <p>The Conservative backbencher John Redwood, a former director of the merchant bank NM Rothschild and chair of David Cameron's economic competitiveness review, said it was time to restore the Bank of England's powers of oversight. 'The banks have managed to evolve a system that allows them to lend more in good times and stop lending in bad times. There's an overall answer, and that's more intelligent central banking that keeps the banks shorter of money in good times.</p> <p>The role of the Bank of England - and the Federal Reserve when under the control of former chairman Alan Greenspan - in fomenting the credit crisis is coming under fierce scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic. When both slashed interest rates to cushion their economies against recession after the dotcom bubble burst in 2000, the stage was set for an extraordinary credit binge.</p> <p>Jim O'Neill, chief global strategist at Goldman Sachs, says: 'Alan Greenspan ran too easy a monetary policy. I think already, one year on, the right questions are being asked: why were US real interest rates so low, for so long?'</p> <p>With Greenspan keeping the cheap money flowing, the banks became increasingly creative. Not content with the old-fashioned banker's job of taking in savers' deposits, and handing them out to worthy borrowers, they devised ever more ingenious methods of channelling billions of dollars of investors' cash, much of it from overseas, into high-risk loans to unsuspecting members of the public.</p> <p>Now the American banks are paying the ultimate price for this frenzied bout of 'financial innovation,' as they and their political backers called it - the promise of much harsher scrutiny; and the worst humiliation of all, nationalisation.</p> <p>The very financial masterminds who have spent the past decade urging governments to set free the 'wealth creators' and safeguard their 'competitiveness' have been brought under the control of Washington. And the government most associated with free-market capitalism and suspicion of state intervention has been forced to undertake the most costly nationalisation programme in living memory.</p> <p>In the US, Republican presidential candidate John McCain has criticised what he called 'failed regulation, reckless management and a casino culture on Wall Street', and called for the sacking of Christopher Cox, the chairman of US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p> <p>Paulson may be promising that no expense will be spared as he rides to the rescue of America's bombed-out financial sector; but the quid pro quo is likely to be a large helping of humble pie.</p> <p>O'Neill, at Goldman, which itself came under fire last week, says Paulson has deliberately held the banks' feet to the fire. 'They were quite happy to see all of us in the private sector shaken up. If you look at what evolved with the unfolding of Lehman, we all have to think about the quality of the model we have got. While it feels traumatic, it doesn't half focus the mind.'</p> <p>Shaun Springer, chief executive of Napier Scott , the financial headhunter based in the City, said he was hoping to pick up a bit of business over the next few weeks as staff at Lehman and other troubled banks looked for new berths; but he knows that the golden age of the City is over.</p> <p>'What we are living through now will reverberate through the rest of the century in the same way the Great Depression did last century. We are witnessing a very real power shift. Money is moving eastwards - while they're creating wealth, we're losing it hand over fist. Where it ends no one knows.</p> <p>'London has enjoyed an unprecedented decade of global dominance. Let's hope people took lots of photos to look back on in the years to come'.</p>",
  "<p>Hazel Blears can be an uninspired performer in the House of Commons, but at lunchtime, at a Fabian Society fringe in the neo-gothic splendour of Manchester's town hall, she outshone a fairly heavyweight line-up. And made the most outspoken remarks. </p> <p>Blears said that Sarah Palin's success in the US was due to the fact that she was seen as an \"anti-politics\" candidate. \"Her politics are horrendous, but she's struck a chord with people - 'I'm a maverick, I'm not part of those powerful people' - and people identified with that.\"</p> <p>Gordon Brown irritated the John McCain campaign recently with the publication of an article that was interpreted as an endorsement of Barack Obama. </p> <p>Maybe someone is going to make a fuss about the \"horrendous\" remark, but I guess the McCain campaign has better things to worry about than what the UK communities secretary said to a party conference about the Republican candidate for vice-president. Besides, Harriet Harman said something similar on Question Time on Thursday.</p> <p>Blears was speaking alongside John Denham, the universities secretary, Brendan Barber, the TUC general secretary, Labour MPs Jon Cruddas and Jon Trickett and the journalist Sunny Hundal. They were talking about what Labour could do to win back the support of the white working class.</p> <p>Cruddas and Trickett both argued that New Labour had not paid enough attention to the interests of the working class. </p> <p>Cruddas said that New Labour assumed \"that the working class was withering away\" as a result of changes to the economy and that this had turned out to be a mistake.</p> <p>Blears outperformed them, not just because she was willing to take a pop at Palin (which was only really an aside, but which went down well with the audience), but because she was just a bit more spiky and impassioned when it came discussing about ordinary life. </p> <p>She talked about her working-class upbringing (her brother is a bus driver) and she had a polite for rebuke for those middle-class idealists who think that the Labour party was founded by people inspired by a philanthropic concern for others. </p> <p>\"The Labour party has never been that,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Miners, dockers, textile workers, steel workers \u2013 they didn't do it out of altruism. They did it to get better wages, better healthcare, better food and a better life for their families.\"</p> <p>I was also taken by the robust line she adopted when someone suggested compulsory voting. Some Labour figures believe this is the solution to electoral apathy. But Blears was having none of that.</p> <p>\"If you have to have compulsory voting, you've lost the argument. Any party that introduced it would be punished dramatically by the electorate\", she said.</p> <p>Two weeks ago the Economist published <a href=\" http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12207995\">an article about British \"rednecks\"</a> and asked where was the Sarah Palin figure who would speak up for them. (The Economist meant disillusioned working class voters, not disillusioned rightwing voters.) </p> <p>When I read the piece, I would never have replied \"Hazel Blears\". But having heard her this afternoon, it doesn't sound such a ludicrous answer.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>4.30pm: Good afternoon to you.</strong> The first fourball should tee off at 5.45pm in the Queen's money. Paul Azinger should be announcing his well-thought-through pairings at 5pm, while Nick Faldo will be presumably drawing names willy-nilly from his big hat at the same time.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>5.10pm: The pairings are in.</strong><br>Weekley/Holmes v Westwood/Hansen (tee-off 5.45pm)<br>Curtis/Stricker v Garcia/Casey (tee-off 6pm, though it'll probably be 7.45pm because Holmes takes effing ages to execute the simplest of tasks)<br>Perry/Furyk v Poulter/McDowell (tee-off 6.15pm)<br>Mickelson/Mahan v Stenson/Karlsson (tee-off 6.30pm)</p> <p>As a result of Holmes leading the way, we should be finished tomorrow just before the singles begin at 5pm.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>5.40pm:</strong> You can follow the dog-end of the morning foursomes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/20/rydercup.livefoursomes\">here</a>, though to be honest I wouldn't bother if I were you, as Europe look jiggered in the last match. Even so, ending the session 7-5 down isn't bad at all given the state Europe were in after yesterday. This could be a classic afternoon of golf.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>5.45pm:</strong> Told you. Padraig Harrington attempts to save the match at the 17th by chipping in a la Larry Mize in the 1987 Masters play-off, but it's not happening. A 4&amp;3 win for Jim Furyk and Kenny Perry means we begin the afternoon like this: <strong>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 7-5 EUROPE</strong></p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>5.50pm: And we're off!</strong> Westwood, straining at the leash all morning, takes to the tee and wangs a terrible drive wide right. Calm down, will you! It could be interesting watching Westwood this afternoon, as he didn't want to be left out this morning - though Faldo insists he needed a rest to recharge his batteries - and he certainly got the funk on over Boo Weekley's orchestration of the crowd yesterday afternoon.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>5.55pm:</strong> A beautiful recovery from Westwood, who hits it pin high from wide right of the fairway. He's about 15-20 feet away. Weekley's roughly the same distance from the pin, but with a trickier putt from the back of the green. Matt Wilson, meanwhile, has close-up experience of Faldo's Big Hat: \"I sat behind him at a wedding once. The largest head (physically, not egocentrically) I've ever seen. He could fit all the players themselves in his hat, not just their names on paper.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>6.05pm:</strong> Westwood and Weekley both stroke in delightful 15-footers for opening birdies. The European responds by waving his arms around, Weekley style. This is going to be great. Back on the tee, Garcia and Casey send pearlers down the fairway against Stricker and Curtis, who were bloody awful yesterday but have started well here with a pair of very decent drives.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>6.10pm:</strong> Stricker hits his approach to 15 feet at the first, in Westwood country just to the right of the flag. But whatever he can do, Casey can better with his wedge by a mammoth three feet! I wouldn't be surprised if this hole is halved in three. \"Rolf Golf looks to be in a right old bunker funk,\" writes Mac Millings. \"I'd say there's a fairway to go before his emotions get back to even par. Let's hope he doesn't tee off on Mrs. Golf when he gets home. Um... perhaps he votes for the Green Party.\" Mac signs off as \"Mac Mulligans\", concluding a cavalcade of such predictable jokes and poor puns that, if you didn't know any better, would normally lead you to assume he was employed full time by us.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>6.20pm:</strong> Casey takes his 12-foot birdie attempt first... and misses! Garcia tries to roll his in from nigh-on 40 feet, but despite a brave effort which ends up inches from the hole, fails. That gives Stricker a straight 15-footer to win the opening hole... but he can't make it. All square after one. Meanwhile Westwood taps in for par at the second, giving Weekley a 20-foot chance to go one up in the afternoon's first match, but the ball's never going in. \"Booooo!\" scream the crowd anyway. I like Weekely's style - <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqTE8xwhow\">this refreshingly honest interview</a>, where he showcases an almost willful ignorance of the game's history, makes for hilarious viewing - but all this \"Boooooo!\" nonsense is getting a tad tedious.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>6.30pm:</strong> Ian Poutler is about to tee off at the first, and while all the \"Booooo\"ing is becoming extremely boring, it could never be half as bad as the \"Walking in a Poulter Wonderland\" song currently being parped out by European fans. STOP IT! \"Very excited to see that I'm the subject of a riff on my favourite HBH (big Gary Naylor fan, by the way),\" writes Nick Faldo's Enormous Head. \"I need to clarify something, though. My huge size is just me living up to my name - 'faldo', as you know, is Latin for 'enormous head'. Of course, it's also Spanish for 'crazed, lunch-sandwich-ordering egotist', and there's currently a debate going on in the brain I house, regarding which is the proper derivation. However, said brain isn't, given my enormity, as big as you'd think, so I don't expect an answer soon.\" Our lawyers would like to point out that this email might not in fact have been written by Nick Faldo nor his Enormous Head. Or even his Big Hat.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>6.35pm:</strong> Holmes and Weekley give themselves similar 25-footers up the hill at the 3rd for birdie, but neither putt is much cop. Two pars. Westwood is also in for three, so Hansen is able to give a tricky 15-foot downhiller a run at the hole, but he doesn't account for the left-to-right break and we're all square without drama. It's been quite a quiet start so far, braying apart. Meanwhile here's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/20/golf.rydercup\">Mike Adamson's report of the morning foursomes</a>.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>6.40pm:</strong> After poor putts from Casey and Garcia at the second, Curtis is left with a birdie chance to win the hole. He's only 10 or 12 feet away, but it's a tricky left-to-right downhill effort. No matter: he rolls it in confidently to put the US one up in the match. That's his first birdie of the tournament in 18 attempts; he couldn't be any worse than he was yesterday, let's face facts.</p> <p><strong>And let's face some more facts, in the shape of the latest scoreboard:</strong> <br>Weekley/Holmes ALL SQUARE Westwood/Hansen (3)<br>Curtis/Stricker 1 UP v Garcia/Casey (2)<br>Perry/Furyk v Poulter/McDowell (-)<br>Mickelson/Mahan v Stenson/Karlsson (-)</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>6.43pm:</strong> Poulter has been fantastic in this Ryder Cup so far, the best player on the European team. He flays a preposterous drive into trouble at the first, but manufactures a wonderful second to around 15 feet, then sinks the birdie putt! This is the sort of manic genius Seve used to come up with. Europe are one up in the third match after the first hole.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>6.45pm:</strong> Chipping to the fourth green, Westwood's ball takes a flier and nestles in the rough just past the apron. The crowd holler and cheer; he gives them the thumbs up. Holmes joins him in the rough. Hansen manages to hold the green with his approach but it's Weekely who ends up closest, his the only ball biting and stopping quickly. He's ten feet away and with a great chance to win the hole. The crowd respond by etc and so on and so forth.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>6.50pm:</strong> Hansen's birdie effort at four, 15 feet down a glacial green, nearly topples in the left-hand side of the cup but skates round the lip and stays up. Weekely steps up and trundles a ridiculous putt wide left of the hole: that was a simple opportunity to win the hole spurned. Meanwhile on the third Garcia misreads terribly on the third green, his simple uphill 15-footer breaking left; this time it's Europe who let a hole slip through their fingers.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>6.55pm:</strong> Neither Mickelson nor Mahan can get particularly close at the first, leaving both Stenson and Karlsson with birdie putts to win the hole. Karlsson has, alongside Ben Curtis, been the worst player in this competition so far, so it's nice that, like Curtis before him, he starts the afternoon with an early birdie. Europe are one up in the final pairing: let's hope that settles his nerves, because he hasn't played to his potential at all so far.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>7pm:</strong> Hansen and Westwood are hacking around in fairway bunkers down the 5th, with Weekley already on the green in two. It doesn't look good for Europe there. Meanwhile at the second Perry drains a huge left-to-right semi-circular putt from 25 feet or so, to bring the Americans level against Poulter and McDowell. \"In the absence of another riff developing, I will continue with the Nick Faldo wedding story,\" offers Matt Wilson. \"The photographer seemed to be drawn by either his star quality, or the gravitational pull of his planet-sized head. About three quarters of the photos were of him, making the bride very unhappy upon receipt of the resulting wedding album.\"</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>7.03pm:</strong> Garcia, Casey and Stricker are peppering the flag at the 4th. It's surely going to be as you were here.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>7.05pm:</strong> And it is, Stricker knocking in his birdie putt, Casey following him in. The Americans remain one up after four.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>7.09pm:</strong> Mahan and Karlsson both hit it to around six feet at the second. Karlsson looks a completely different player already. Weekley misses his birdie effort at five, but both Europeans still have some work to do to make par.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>7.10pm:</strong> What a putt by Hansen, who knocks in his putt from 15 feet to snatch a half from Weekley and Holmes. That will feel like a victory, because both Europeans stumbled up the hole like a couple of drunks. <br><strong>Here's the state of play:</strong><br>Weekley/Holmes v Westwood/Hansen (5)<br>Curtis/Stricker 1 UP v Garcia/Casey (4)<br>Perry/Furyk v Poulter/McDowell (2)<br>Mickelson/Mahan v 1 UP Stenson/Karlsson (1)</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>7.15pm:</strong> Meet the new Karlsson, same as the old Karlsson. He misses an easy putt from six feet, never on line. Absolutely terrible. Mahan makes no such mistake and the match is all square again.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>7.20pm:</strong> Boo's in bother behind a tree down the left on the sixth, and can only send his second shot wide right of the green. Westwood meanwhile is faffing around down the right, and can only send a low runner bouncing down to the apron at the green front. Holmes's second finds the green, but he's snookered by the apron and won't have a free run at the hole. Hansen, meanwhile, dumps his in the bunker. Not a whole lot of great golf going on there; are the nerves kicking in?</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>7.27pm:</strong> Mickelson makes his team's second consecutive birdie at 3, knocking in a fairly straight but nonetheless impressive 25-foot effort to win the hole and go one up. Westwood has just hit the worst chip in the history of All Golf at the sixth: from the front of the green he gets the ball about halfway up, doesn't beat the ridge, and sees it sail wide right, about 40 feet from the pin. Terrible. Weekley meanwhile, from trouble on the right, knocks his third to four feet. The momentum is with the US at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>7.28pm:</strong> Hansen hits his bunker shot at six far too strongly. Europe look like losing this hole to par, a poor state of affairs.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>7.35pm:</strong> Hansen misses his par putt; Weekley knocks in his from four feet to go one up. Europe are losing the battles at the moment.<br><strong>Latest scoreboard</strong><br>Weekley/Holmes 1 UP v Westwood/Hansen (6)<br>Curtis/Stricker 1 UP v Garcia/Casey (5)<br>Perry/Furyk v Poulter/McDowell (4)<br>Mickelson/Mahan 1 UP v Stenson/Karlsson (3)</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>7.40pm:</strong> Four approaches to the sixth in the Curtis/Stricker v Garcia/Casey match, none of them any good. Garcia in particular hit a nothing shot; he's totally failed to catch fire in this Ryder Cup.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>7.45pm:</strong> At the split-fairway par-five 7th, all four players in the Weekley/Holmes v Westwood/Hansen tie are lined up at the edge of the water. They take their turns to go for the green. Holmes first, he sends one miles into the sky and through the green into filth at the back. Weekley sends his pin high, but it's woefully sliced and ends up behind a bunker in knotted rough. Hansen is next, and he's in Holmes Country. Which leaves Westwood, in perfect position. He steps up and hits his four-iron onto the green - but the ball skips through and jumps into the rough at the back. Anything could happen here.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>7.53pm:</strong> Holmes takes a wild Mickelsonesque flop at his ball, and it's a great effort, sending it 12-15 feet from the pin. Just how good it was is soon illustrated by Hansen, who almost punches his effort through the green; he's left with a long putt for his birdie. Weekley plays a less elaborate flop to around eight feet, then Westwood gives up on his chip, sending the ball a mere four or five feet onto the green. Nobody's dead, but the Americans are much more likely to win this hole.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>8pm:</strong> Holmes strokes in his birdie attempt. Hansen having already missed his, Westwood needs to hole out to avoid going two down. He can't make his 15-footer, the ball staying high on the right and never looking like breaking back towards the cup. This is a very poor showing from all the Europeans, and getting irritated by the Weekley sideshow, which Westwood is clearly allowing himself to be, is not going to help the cause. You would think Nick Faldo might be on hand to put a calming hand on Westwood's shoulder, but he's nowhere to be seen at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>8.03pm:</strong> Casey and Garcia have both creamed magnificent second shots into the seventh green. At the 8th, Westwood and Hansen both fly through the upturned saucer masquerading as a green. This match is beginning to slip away from Europe.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>8.10pm:</strong> Weekley is alongside Westwood and Hansen down the back of the eighth. Hansen can only putt his ball up the hill onto the top of the green, but both Weekley and Westwood hit beauties dead. Holmes, the only man to find the green, has a long putt for birdie. Which is missed: hole halved. Incidentally, Paul Azinger was in animated conversation with the match referee at the last green. What about, nobody seems to know, though the wise money seems to be on calming Weekley down: he's previously been orchestrating the crowd by waving his arms in semaphore shapes, but after that great putt he was very reserved.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>8.12pm:</strong> There's no spark about Europe at all. Both Garcia and Casey fanny their eagle putts at seven. Casey's in particular had no oomph behind it whatsoever, given Garcia had already secured his four. The hole is halved, Curtis and Stricker still one up.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>8.15pm:</strong> McDowell drains a putt from about 50 feet on the sixth to save a half. That's the only good thing a European has managed for about two hours. I repeat, this is a pathetically limp showing from Europe so far. \"Not sure about the quality of the golf,\" writes Simon Thomas, \"but the Holmes Weekley pairing must surely have the lowest combined IQ in Ryder Cup history.\" Note to any US readers: please don't get angry. Just look at us. The only weapon we have left is the cheap shot.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>8.20pm: scoreboard. THIS IS HELLISHLY SLOW.</strong><br>Weekley/Holmes 2 UP v Westwood/Hansen (8)<br>Curtis/Stricker 1 UP v Garcia/Casey (7)<br>Perry/Furyk v Poulter/McDowell (6)<br>Mickelson/Mahan 1 UP v Stenson/Karlsson (5)</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>8.22pm: WHAT EMOTION FROM SERGIO!</strong> He's miles away from the pin at the par-three 8th, but rolls in what could be the putt of the tournament so far, a 40-foot right-to-left affair which drops in. \"COME ON!\" he screams at genuinely earsplitting decibels. \"COME OOOOONNNN!\" he adds, with fistpumps. It's not for a win, though as Stricker is much closer and knocks in a decent 15-footer himself to half. Stricker does a bit of screaming of his own, but it's not so convincing. In a strange way, that might just kick-start Europe.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>8.25pm:</strong> Well if it is going to kick-start Europe, the effect isn't immediate. At the short par-four ninth, all four players pepper the flag. But to mixed results: Hansen is the closest, Westwood the furthest away (as his was the only ball to bite so viciously it span back off the green). Westwood, Weekley and Holmes all miss their efforts, leaving Hansen a simple eight-footer to win the hole. Not for the first time this afternoon, Europe pass up an easy chance. That was dreadful. Europe have to get something moving somewhere soon, because at this rate the Ryder Cup will be effectively decided tonight.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>The one you've all been waiting for, the 8.27pm scoreboard</strong><br>Weekley/Holmes 2UP v Westwood/Hansen (9)<br>Curtis/Stricker 1 UP v Garcia/Casey (8)<br>Perry/Furyk v Poulter/McDowell (6)<br>Mickelson/Mahan 1 UP v Stenson/Karlsson (6)</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>8.35pm:</strong> A chance at the seventh for Poulter and McDowell: Furyk's third flies 30 feet past the pin, Perry's - an attempted chip over a bunker - is duffed straight into the sand. McDowell's third, a long putt from the front-right of the green, is hit to three feet and should be good for birdie.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>8.38pm:</strong> At the long par-five tenth, Weekley, Westwood and Hansen all miss the green with their second shots. Holmes, however, after a ridiculously long drive, sends a seven iron - <em>a seven iron</em> - into the heart of the green. I can't see Westwood and Hansen coming back at these two at all, their games have wilted in the face of their aggressive play.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>8.40pm:</strong> Some blue on the leaderboard at last, Poulter securing the win for Europe at the seventh. Along with McDowell, he's now one up on Perry and Furyk.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>8.45pm:</strong> Casey misses a superb birdie chance on nine, allowing Stricker a run at the hole from an almost identical position. Luckily for Europe, the American misses. The hole is halved. Holmes meanwhile isn't even asked to make his eagle putt on 10; they go to 11 three up on Westwood and Hansen, who don't bother the cup and are capitulating in a sorry fashion. This is so lame from Europe. Time for a Lightly Amusing Golf Joke, courtesy of <strong>Lightly Amusing Golf Joke dept.</strong> \"Golfer to his caddy at the end of the round: You are the worst caddy in the world! Caddy: I don't think so sir. That would be too much of a coincidence.\" Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for Kevin Mannerings; he'll be here all week.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>8.50pm:</strong> The door is flung open for Westwood and Hansen to immediately get back into the match: Weekely is in filth to the right of the green at the par-three 11th, while Holmes hits it fat and takes up a huge divot, a good 15-20 yards short of the green! <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/19/golf.rydercup\">Maurice Flitcroft would have been proud of that one.</a> Westwood and Hansen both make the green, but nowhere near the pin, failing to pile on any pressure whatsoever.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>8.52pm:</strong> McDowell seems to be the only European fighting tooth and nail here. He holes another staunch putt to scramble a half, securing his birdie with a tricky 15-foot downhiller.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>8.55pm: THIS IS SLIPPING AWAY FROM EUROPE.</strong> The US go two up in the final match, Mickelson knocking in a 20-foot left-to-right eagle putt on seven after Stenson and Karlsson both miss theirs.</p> <p><strong>The latest scoreboard</strong><br>Weekley/Holmes 3 UP v Westwood/Hansen (10)<br>Curtis/Stricker 1 UP v Garcia/Casey (9)<br>Perry/Furyk v Poulter/McDowell 1 UP (8)<br>Mickelson/Mahan 2UP v Stenson/Karlsson (7)</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>9pm:</strong> Gotta love Sky Sports. They went off to a break, and when they came back Westwood or Hansen have secured the 11th for Europe; they're now just two down. Could this be a turning point? I didn't see it, and turning points are invisible, after all.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>9.05pm:</strong> Garcia's going down fighting, if he's going down at all. His brilliant chip from the edge of the green at 10 nearly drops for eagle but stays on the lip; to a chorus of boos, nothing to do with Weekley this time, he flings his wedge to the ground with not inconsiderable force. Stricker misses his birdie opportunity and the match is level. Caring not a jot that he's just wound up the galleries immensely, Garcia skips down the bank towards the next tee in the jauntiest of manners. It's a wonder he didn't throw in a few heelclicks.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>9.10pm:</strong> The worst putt of the weekend has just been made by Perry, who misses a tiddler at nine after Poulter has birdied; the Europeans are now two up in that match. There's a sense that Europe are FINALLY COMING TO LIFE.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>9.12pm:</strong> Three wonderful shots at 11, Curtis, Stricker and Casey all giving themselves birdie putts at the par three. Meanwhile scrub the worst putt of the weekend thing: Weekley, putting for the hole at 12 from the apron, stubs his putter into the ground and sends the ball forward about six feet. He's still got a fair old distance to cover. Could this be the most preposterous of steals?</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>9.15pm:</strong> No, because Hansen can't hole his 15-foot par putt, which would have put an amazing amount of pressure on Weekley. Now the American has a putt of similar length for par and a three-hole lead. He doesn't make it, though, and that half will feel like a minor victory for Europe.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>9.20pm:</strong> Casey misses his birdie attempt at 11, giving both Curtis and Stricker chances to steal the hole. Curtis is so unlucky, tapping a super-quick putt wide left, only to see it turn right at the very last. A wonderful attempt from a player who has been struggling for form. Then it's Stricker's turn: from 15 feet behind the hole he skims the left lip. Again, that's incredibly unlucky. You have to feel for the Americans there. What? Eh?</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>9.22pm and it's like this, with Stenson just having hit his approach dead at nine:</strong> <br>Weekley/Holmes 2 UP v Westwood/Hansen (12)<br>Curtis/Stricker A/S Garcia/Casey (11)<br>Perry/Furyk v Poulter/McDowell 2 UP (9)<br>Mickelson/Mahan 2 UP v Stenson/Karlsson (8)</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>Gary Naylor's Great Ideas (number one in a series of one):</strong> \"Any chance of the captains contriving to ensure that redneck Boo Weekley tees it up against metrosexual Ian Poulter in tomorrow's singles? The Boo and Pou Show would be excellent sport.\"</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>9.25pm:</strong> Mahan makes a wonderful birdie putt at nine from 30 feet, rendering Stenson's wonderful approach essentially redundant. It becomes even more pointless as Karlsson knocks in his birdie from 15 feet to halve the hole. Wonderful golf all round, but the States will feel happier with the escape.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>9.30pm:</strong> Weekley and Holmes pull their approaches at 13, though they both find the green, while Hansen chips to 15 feet. There could be an opportunity for Europe to get right back into that match there. McDowell has a tricky eight-footer at 10 to halve the hole... and misses. Luckily for Europe, Poulter also has a putt, his very slightly shorter, and he shows his stones by rolling it in. They're still two up.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>9.35pm:</strong> Casey knocks a beautiful nine iron into the 12th. Holmes and Weekley both miss their putts, so Hansen has a great chance to win the hole, 15 feet away left lip. And he knocks it in brilliantly, Westwood screaming \"COME ON!\" Sergio style. They're now just one down. There is certainly a bit of momentum with Europe now, even though it's not quite reflected in the scoreboard.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>9.40pm:</strong> Both Hansen and Westwood pull their tee shots at the par-three 14th into bunkers on the left. That's not exactly keeping the pressure on, is it? Weekley's shot is wonderful, and unlucky to just creep into the apron back right of the green; it's not far from the pin, though, 15 feet maybe. Holmes meanwhile finds the green too, but he's right at the front and the thing is a behemoth.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>9.42pm:</strong> Casey rattles his birdie opportunity at 12 past the hole, but Curtis still needs to knock a six-footer in for half. He makes no mistake; we go on. \"Assuming the USA go on to win, does this mean that John McCain will now win the election?\" asks Ross Tom. \"I seem to remember George W Bush got in last time the Americans won?\" How should I know? Do I look like Michael Tomasky? \"We'll have to blame Nick Faldo.\" I can at least do that for you.<br><strong>The latest:</strong><br>Weekley/Holmes 1 UP v Westwood/Hansen (13)<br>Curtis/Stricker v Garcia/Casey (12)<br>Perry/Furyk v Poulter/McDowell 2 UP (10)<br>Mickelson/Mahan 2 UP v Stenson/Karlsson (9)</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>9.50pm:</strong> Weekley whips the crowd into a frenzy by powering home his 15-footer. That was a confident stroke to take the American pair back to two up against Westwood and Hansen.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>10pm:</strong> Weekley hits his second at 15 to two feet from a fairway bunker. Simply amazing, especially as Hansen had hit to within ten feet moments earlier. Meanwhile there are amazing scenes on 13, as Stricker drains a monster only for Garcia to turn in his left-to-right putt from 25 feet to halve the hole.<br><strong>It's scoreboard time:</strong><br>Weekley/Holmes 2 UP v Westwood/Hansen (14)<br>Curtis/Stricker A/S Garcia/Casey (13)<br>Perry/Furyk v Poulter/McDowell 2 UP (11)<br>Mickelson/Mahan 2 UP v Stenson/Karlsson (10)</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>10.02pm:</strong> Westwood has just whacked in his birdie putt on 15. Amazingly, the Europeans haven't conceded Weekley's putt - it's only about a foot from the cup! Of course he makes no mistake and the Americans remain two up with three to play. Europe did well to halve that hole, though.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>10.05pm:</strong> Anything could happen at 14, where Casey's tee shot finds a greenside bunker, both Americans fail to get on the top level of the green, and Garcia's ball sits on the apron on the top ridge. Good up and downs from Poulter and Stenson keeps things as they are in the bottom two matches.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>BALLS.</strong> There is a weather warning; a thunderstorm could be moving in. Let's hope the clouds bugger off, because this is heating up just nicely.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>SCRUB THOSE BALLS.</strong> According to Sky, and in turn probably according to someone else, a weatherman perchance, there will be rain in half an hour, but the chance of thunder is minimal. That's much better news.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>10.10pm:</strong> Curtis so nearly sinks the mother of all putts from the bottom ridge on the 14th; taking a huge left-to-right break, the ball only just turns in front of the cup and fails to drop. Majestic. He's been very decent - and very unlucky - with his putter today.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>10.15pm:</strong> It's all square still after 14, then, between Curtis/Stricker and Garcia/Casey, as Garcia is inches away from chipping in from the edge of the green. Some wonderful golf from both sides. Meanwhile on 16, both Westwood and Holmes give themselves perfectly makeable birdie chances. With the Americans two up, we're at the business end, right here.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>10.18pm:</strong> Furyk's ball on 13 is almost dead - but McDowell follows him there, so much so that his ball kisses off his opponent's. That looks like a half.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>10.23pm:</strong> More putting misfortune for the Americans, as Holmes tickles a lovely birdie putt downhill towards the cup from 15 feet, only for the ball to turn left at the last and tremble on the lip. Westwood is left with a birdie opportunity from front left of the green, 20 feet away. He can't give the ball too much of a rattle, though, as Hansen has only made five, so to keep the match alive he has to get up and down. Westwood keeps it out to the left - and lets it rumble on four feet, so there's still work to do! A terrible effort.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>10.24pm:</strong> Westwood knocks it straight into the back of the cup, but the Americans are now dormie two. Still, this is exactly where they were yesterday. Though it's doubtful lightening can strike twice.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>10.25pm:</strong> Well, hold on, I'm not sure what happened at 12, they've not been keeping up with that game, but Karlsson has just nailed a ten-footer to win the hole! He and Stenson are now only one down with six to play.</p> <p><strong>Scoreboard</strong><br>Weekley/Holmes 2 UP v Westwood/Hansen (16)<br>Curtis/Stricker A/S Garcia/Casey (14)<br>Perry/Furyk v Poulter/McDowell 2 UP (13)<br>Mickelson/Mahan 2 UP v Stenson/Karlsson (12)</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>10.30pm:</strong> Such a great tee shot at the par-three 14th from McDowell, who hits it to ten feet or so. However Perry then lifts a superb shot to three or four inches! Simply sensational, and the pressure really is on McDowell now to sink his birdie putt and keep Europe two up in the match.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>10.32pm:</strong> Mahan hits his second at 13 to four feet. Majestic. There is suddenly an awful lot of world-class golf being played.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>10.34pm:</strong> Garcia's birdie attempt at 15 horseshoes out - it was a brilliant effort but in truth a tad too hard - and Stricker is left with a fancy right-to-left curler from 12 feet. The ball turns sharp left at the very last and the hole is halved. No such luck for McDowell on 14: his ball stays out on the right just as he was throwing putter-pointing shapes in the manner of Jack Nicklaus at Augusta in 1986. He has to make do with throwing it up in the air in disgust instead, as the Perry and Furyk skip jauntily off, now only one down.</p> <p><strong>Scoreboard</strong><br>Weekley/Holmes 2 UP v Westwood/Hansen (16)<br>Curtis/Stricker A/S Garcia/Casey (15)<br>Perry/Furyk v Poulter/McDowell 1 UP (14)<br>Mickelson/Mahan 1 UP v Stenson/Karlsson (12)</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>10.40pm:</strong> Westwood and Hansen both give themselves makeable birdie chances at 17, but while Weekley comes up short of the green, Holmes gives himself one as well. That could be that for Europe. But a sensation on the 13th green: Karlsson makes a birdie three, then Mahan misses a ridiculous tiddler to hand the hole to the Europeans! Could a third Mickelson lead end in dismal failure?</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>10.41pm:</strong> Holmes so unluckily misses his birdie chance at 17, the ball failing to turn when it surely should have done. That gives Europe two birdie chances, neither of them easy, to win this hole and keep the match alive.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>10.43pm:</strong> Hansen takes his putt first: it's further away, but easier of line. His effort is never going in, though, staying on top all the way. That was not impressive. It leaves Westwood with a tricky 12-foot right-to left putt, downhill all the way. It will take some doing to get this one to drop. And... he doesn't, the ball almost dropping but lipping out on the left and staying on the dancefloor. The crowd go wild, as you'd expect. <strong>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 8-5 EUROPE.</strong></p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>10.45pm, and this is how we're standing, with the Ryder Cup on a knife-edge:</strong><br>Weekley/Holmes 2&amp;1 v Westwood/Hansen (F)<br>Curtis/Stricker A/S Garcia/Casey (15)<br>Perry/Furyk v Poulter/McDowell 1 UP (14)<br>Mickelson/Mahan A/S Stenson/Karlsson (13)</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>10.50pm:</strong> There is some ridiculous pin-peppering going on at present. Furyk has just sent his second at 16 to within two inches, which makes McDowell's approach to five foot look average! Meanwhile on 14 both Karlsson and Mickelson are very close to the pin, birdies a distinct possibility. But of course while birdies are possible, so are sudden swings. This is a very strange atmosphere, because America could as good as secure this Ryder Cup in the next hour or so... or throw away a huge lead.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>10.55pm:</strong> McDowell, who has been fantastic today, holes his birdie putt at 16 under extreme pressure; Europe hold onto their one-hole lead with two to play. Meanwhile Karlsson has just rattled his birdie attempt in at 14... though Mickelson follows him in to keep the match all square. This is amazing stuff.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>10.57pm:</strong> Stricker has just sent a wonderful birdie attempt from the edge of the green to the very edge of the cup. That was a good 40 feet at least; yet again the US can bemoan bad luck on the greens. And how annoyed they will now be: Garcia needed to drop a 20-footer to secure a half, and did. The match is still all square after 16.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>11pm scoreboard</strong><br>Weekley/Holmes 2&amp;1 v Westwood/Hansen (F)<br>Curtis/Stricker A/S Garcia/Casey (16)<br>Perry/Furyk v Poulter/McDowell 1 UP (15)<br>Mickelson/Mahan A/S Stenson/Karlsson (14)</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>11.01pm:</strong> The door is open for the US at 16, with Poulter having flown through the green and McDowell dumping his approach in a bunker at the front.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>11.03pm:</strong> Perry and Furyk, meanwhile, are both on the green.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>11.04pm:</strong> Mahan has just hit his second on 15 to ten feet. Given the amount of birdies Stenson and Karlsson have made over the last few holes, to go one down with two to play would be a body blow.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>11.05pm:</strong> From a greenside bunker, Stricker can only just make the apron at the front of the 17th green. Curtis is in the centre of the fairway, though, and his approach is beautiful, about 12 feet behind the hole. It's roughly where Westwood was, so it's not a gimmie.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>11.10pm:</strong> Karlsson birdies 15 with a 15-footer, which is just as well considering where Mahan is. The American sweeps up to halve the hole. Meanwhile on 17, both Garcia and Casey find the green, Casey much closer, ten feet directly in front of the hole.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>11.12pm:</strong> Furyk nearly sinks a 25-footer on 16 to win the hole and level his match, but the ball just stays out on top. Then almost exactly the same thing happens to Perry, whose putt looks like dropping then turns just before the cup. This is becoming incredibly tense.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>11.15pm:</strong> McDowell has - yet again - just holed another medium-range putt to save a half. This one is left-to-right and 15 feet from the cup; the Americans will be sick at that. He and Poulter are still one up, now with only two holes to play.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>11.17pm:</strong> Stricker, Garcia and Casey - the latter having been piss-poor with his putter all day - miss their birdie chances at 17. That leaves Curtis with his eight-to-ten footer to win the hole.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>11.20pm:</strong> An utterly pathetic effort from Curtis, who prods gingerly at his right-to-left effort and watches it stagger downhill, then bugger off left with no interest whatsoever in dropping. So timid. The pairs go to the last with it all up for grabs. Dear me, this is tense, the whole shape of tomorrow's singles could be dramatically altered one way or other within the hour.<br><strong>As we are...</strong><br>Weekley/Holmes 2&amp;1 v Westwood/Hansen (F)<br>Curtis/Stricker A/S Garcia/Casey (17)<br>Perry/Furyk v Poulter/McDowell 1 UP (16)<br>Mickelson/Mahan A/S Stenson/Karlsson (15)</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>11.25pm:</strong> On 16, Stenson hits his approach to the heart of the green. Mickelson does too, but gets a dreadfully unlucky kick left, sending his ball towards the back of the green, miles from the hole. Meanwhile Sergio sends an almost perfect drive down 18, Casey into a shallow bunker. Similar for the Americans: Curtis's drive is pulled and he may not be able to reach the green in two, but Stricker splits the fairway.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>11.30pm:</strong> Poulter and Furyk both give themselves wonderful birdie chances at 17. Karlsson bumps and runs a lovely wedge into the 16th, almost ensuring Europe a four. With Mahan having already taken four, and Mickelson a fair distance from the hole with a tricky line to negotiate, this is advantage Europe. But I wouldn't be putting any money on anything, this is so tense.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>11.31pm:</strong> Curtis has hit his second into utter filth on the right. Casey meanwhile hits a wood from sand and is lucky to stay on the fairway, leaving himself a wedge. Mickelson meanwhile gave his birdie putt at 16 a good run, but it says on top on the right.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>11.32pm:</strong> Garcia makes the green with his second at the last, but he's a long way from the pin. This may well be all down to what Stricker comes up with... and he's stuck it right, blocking a hybrid club into filth. Meanwhile on 16, the groups have agreed to share the hole in four.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>11.33pm: WHAT A PUTT FROM POULTER!</strong> He rolls a big right-to-left breaker on 17; Furyk needs to hole a tricky right-to-left eight-footer to make a half. And he does - the ball doing 720 degrees round the lip before dropping! Amazing stuff. Europe are still one up going down the last.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>11.35pm:</strong> Casey, 60 yards out, bumps a wedge just onto the front of the green. He's got an uphill putt left, which should count as insurance, allowing Garcia to take a run at the flag. Though much depends on how Curtis and Stricker escape.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>11.37pm:</strong> Curtis can only punch his third ten yards or so ahead, his hozzle getting caught in the thick Kentucky grass. His fourth goes 12 feet past the pin; the best he can make is five, and even that's not certain.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>11.40pm:</strong> Now it's Stricker's third, from the deep stuff out right. He's greenside, though, unlike Curtis who was well short of the green. The tension is palpable: he asks a crowd member to turn their radio down. He eventually punches out... and it's a fantastic effort, the ball bumbling down the green onto the front edge. He's got a tricky putt of about 18 feet to come back, which isn't great but from where he was almost counts as miraculous. And remember, Sergio's long putt from the back of the green is hellishly difficult. This is still in the balance.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>11.42pm:</strong> What a putt from Garcia: he has to putt 20 feet uphill, then let the ball break almost at 90 degrees to the right, whereupon it skitters down the hill and settles six feet from the pin. That's not dead, but just about the best he could do. Both Stricker and Garcia have just had moments of genius there, and yet their rewards are very slight indeed.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>11.44pm:</strong> What an escape from Stricker, who knocks his putt straight into the centre of the cup. That is superb, an unbelievable par, and a real blow for Europe, who have two putts to halve the match - but neither of them certs.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>11.45pm:</strong> And so Casey, who has missed just about every putt all round, knocks his effort straight into the hole. The match is halved. That was almost unbearable drama, and the Europeans look very pleased indeedm though I'll suggest more in relief than anything else; when they look back at this hole it might seem like a point dropped. <strong>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 8.5-6.5 EUROPE.</strong></p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>11.50pm scoreboard:</strong> <br>Weekley/Holmes 2&amp;1 v Westwood/Hansen (F)<br>Curtis/Stricker A/S Garcia/Casey (F)<br>Perry/Furyk v Poulter/McDowell 1 UP (17)<br>Mickelson/Mahan A/S Stenson/Karlsson (16)</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>11.51pm:</strong> Europe's nerves are betraying them up the last: both McDowell and Poutler push their second shots right, both leaving themselves short wedges to the green. Furyk, meanwhile, finds the very front edge of the green with his, while Perry is pin high just to the right. Advantage USA.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>11.52pm:</strong> And it's advantage USA on the 17th too. Karlsson nearly chips in with his third stroke, but Mickelson has a downhill birdie chance from ten feet.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>11.53pm:</strong> McDowell's third into the final green with his wedge, isn't great: he's a good 15-20 feet past the hole, from where a four looks unlikely.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>11.54pm:</strong> Now it's Poulter's pitch... and it is a simply fantastic shot, which bites six feet by the hole and stays there. Meanwhile Europe are so unfortunate on 17, Stenson sending a delicious right-to-left downhill 30-footer to an inch. Which leaves Mickelson his six-footer for the win.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>11.56pm: MICKELSON MISSES!</strong> Jesus wept.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>11.58pm:</strong> Right, this is it on 18. Perry duffs his chip to the green, so he's out. Furyk pretty much has to sink his effort from right against the collar of the green to save the match. He takes what seems like an age to line the putt up, walks away, returns, lines up, walks away, returns... and eventually hits a terrible putt which pops up off the face of his putter and stays out right. Poulter should sink his putt, but oh, the pressure. And anyway McDowell has got to take his shot first. The tension of the Ryder Cup... help me.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>Midnight:</strong> McDowell steps up to hit his putt down the slope, but it's not a particularly good one. It'll all be down to Poulter, then.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>12.02am:</strong> Suddenly Poulter's putt doesn't look half as easy, but he knocks it in with supreme confidence, turns and, with a wild look in his eye, pumps a fist. Europe win 1 up. Absolutely fantastic: Poulter has been without question the star of the European side so far. <strong>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 8.5-6.5 EUROPE</strong></p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>12.05am:</strong> The final match, then. Mahan sends a beautiful second shot to the edge of the green, which makes a European victory suddenly seem unlikely. The next ten minutes or so are so crucial.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>12.08am:</strong> Karlsson hits a shot just past the green and to the right. For a second it doesn't look great, but then the ball grips, spins back and rolls slowly down the green. He's within 15 feet, maybe 12, certainly in slightly better shape than Mahan. Stenson responds by dumping his approach into a bunker at the front of the green.</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>12.10am:</strong> With Mickelson in Stricker Country on the right and Stenson in the bunker, this looks like being Mahan v Karlsson. Especially when Lefty hits the worst pitch of his life, punching the ball a mere four yards forward.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>12.11am:</strong> Mickelson hits another poor pitch; he's going to have to leave it to Mahan to do his best.</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>12.13am:</strong> The next two putts are basically going to decide whether tomorrow is essentially a write-off for Europe or almost back to square one. Mahan hits his putt... but he doesn't set it out far enough to the right and it's always breaking left. That's a four, though.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>12.15am:</strong> So, Karlsson has a ten-footer to win the match. It's left to right downhill... but never coming back from the left and stays out. At the very worst, the USA will be two in front tomorrow. But neither Karlsson nor Stenson have gimmies, both at least four feet from the pin. Dear me.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>12.16am:</strong> But Karlsson makes no mistake coming back. <strong>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 9-7 EUROPE.</strong></p> <p><strong>The Day Two Fourballs</strong><br>Weekley/Holmes 2&amp;1 v Westwood/Hansen (F)<br>Curtis/Stricker A/S Garcia/Casey (F)<br>Perry/Furyk v Poulter/McDowell 1 UP (F)<br>Mickelson/Mahan A/S Stenson/Karlsson (F)</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>So it was Europe's day.</strong> And think, it would have been all level going into tomorrow had Karlsson's putt dropped and Stricker not made the most amazing up and down from deep filth. A wonderful day's golf which at least guarantees an exciting singles day: after yesterday's European performance that looked unlikely.

  "<p>Thabo Mbeki today agreed to step down as South Africa's president after the country's ruling party formally requested his resignation over allegations he misused his power.</p> <p>The African National Congress's national executive had decided to \"recall the president before his term of office expires\", Gwede Mantashe, the party's secretary general, told reporters in Johannesburg. The \"long and difficult\" decision followed more than a day of discussions.</p> <p>Later, a spokesman for Mbeki, in power since 1999, said that following the decision, \"the president has obliged and will step down after all constitutional requirements have been met\".</p> <p>The decision is the culmination of a bitter power struggle between Mbeki and his chief rival, Jacob Zuma, the ANC's leader. Mbeki denies accusations he conspired against Zuma in a corruption case.</p> <p>Although Zuma has long been seen as Mbeki's likely successor, he is not expected to take over immediately. Mantashe said Mbeki would remain president until an interim figure is appointed. Mantashe also said parliament would meet soon to formalise the process. There was no decision as yet on whether to hold early elections, he added.</p> <p>The move threatens to destabilise the country, especially if other cabinet ministers act on threats to resign in solidarity with the president.</p> <p>Several key figures, including the deputy president, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, have indicated they will follow Mbeki.</p> <p>The executive began discussions yesterday over whether to force Mbeki from office. A decision had been expected last night, but was delayed amid apparent deadlock.</p> <p>The meeting was called after a high court judge accused Mbeki and senior justice officials of being part of an illegal conspiracy to charge Zuma with corruption for political ends.</p> <p>Last week, Mbeki had told the cabinet he would accept whatever decision the ANC made, while denying any involvement in the decision to prosecute Zuma.</p> <p>One of the country's most respected former judges, Willem Heath, has called for the president, his former justice minister, Penuell Maduna, and the former chief prosecutor, Bulelani Ngcuka, to be charged with crimes for pursuing a political prosecution.</p> <p>His call followed a ruling last week by a high court judge, Chris Nicholson, against the prosecution of Zuma, which he said was the result of \"baleful political influence\". Heath told a Johannesburg newspaper, the Mail and Guardian, that South Africans needed protection from the \"systematic abuse, detailed in the judgment, of organs of state by the president and his purported henchmen.</p> <p>\"If the behaviour ... is not addressed, the application of the principle of the separation of powers will remain at the whim of those who have seemingly been using it most effectively for personal gain.\"<br>He said the ruling was\"probably the most important judgment delivered in this country in the past many years\".</p> <p>Mbeki succeeded Nelson Mandela in 1999 and was due to stand down next year. During his time in office, Mbeki won praise for guiding the country's economy through a period of sustained growth but faced controversy over his insistence that that the HIV virus, which has infected more than 5 million South Africans, does not cause Aids.</p> <p>Some senior party officials said they would not support ousting Mbeki because of the damage it would do to the party.</p> <p>Mbhazima Shilowa, the premier of Gauteng province, with Johannesburg and Pretoria at its heart, said that a no confidence vote would divide the ANC.</p> <p>\"I think members of the executive will not vote for that motion,\" he said. \"I personally don't think the judgment provides any basis to say the president must go.\"</p> <p>But some ANC factions, including the party's youth league, Communists and trade unionists have lobbied hard to oust Mbeki. The left of the party has used the crisis over Zuma as a vehicle to bring down the president, first as ANC leader, because they were strongly opposed to his market-oriented economic policies.</p> <p>The council of churches said that removing Mbeki could plunge the country into a crisis. \"The recalling or impeachment of the president will lead to the collapse of the current executive and would plunge the country into an ... unnecessary crisis. The negative political and economic repercussions of such an induced collapse are too ghastly to contemplate.\"</p>",
  "<p>It won't be, because we have to talk about lipstick and pigs and probably Jeremiah Wright one more time, but it sure <em>should </em>be over after people learn about this one. </p> <p>It comes <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/mccain-on-banking-and-health/\">via Paul Krugman</a>, or actually a reader of Krugman's, who alerted him to these passages McCain had written in an obscure actuarial journal about market-based health reform:<br></p> <blockquote> <p><br>Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.</p> </blockquote> <p>Oops! Blast those early deadlines! Haven't we all written something for monthlies or quarterlies that was, as we say in our trade, \"overtaken by events.\"</p> <p>Overtaken by events, in the sense that he'd like to have those words back. But nevertheless expressive of what the McCain campaign actually believes. Make healthcare more like banking. If Obama and the DNC aren't all over this immediately, it's malpractice.<br></p>",
