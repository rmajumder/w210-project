  "<p>Cory Booker's message was clear. Unveiling a plaque to commemorate deadly race riots in his city 41 years ago, the young black Mayor of Newark, New Jersey, was thinking of the future as much as the past. Though 26 people died in the troubles and the city turned into a byword for racial tensions and crime, Booker was determined not to make the event about America's past racism and segregation.</p> <p>'I am of a different generation,' he told a crowd of onlookers in the stifling heat of a Newark summer's day. 'I have never in my life seen a sign, but in a museum, that says \"Whites only\". I am from a generation that came about in a different era.'</p> <p>Such honest words, wilfully breaking free from the Sixties civil rights struggle, would once have been unthinkable from a leading black politician, especially when speaking to a mostly black audience. But now, as Barack Obama runs to be America's first black President, a new cadre of so-called 'post-racial' black politicians have moved to the fore. They are changing the face of black American politics.</p> <p>Shaking off the traditional black power structures of civil rights groups and the black church, they have distanced themselves from figures such as Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. They have also posed a challenge to established black politicians with roots in the old civil rights era, such as South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn and Georgia congressman John Lewis. The new politicians have based their appeal on anything but race. They have forged voter coalitions across racial boundaries, including whites and Hispanics. And it has worked. </p> <p>Booker is a hugely popular mayor in Newark. He is not alone. Deval Patrick has become the first black governor of heavily white Massachusetts. David Paterson is the first black governor of New York. Adrian Fenty, aged just 37, is the young black mayor of Washington DC, and a world away from the black politicians that came before him. In Atlanta the black mayor, Shirley Franklin, is hugely popular with the powerful white business community. </p> <p>All of them - like Obama - have won electoral success by seeking to move beyond racial identity. They could be the first trickles of a coming flood. 'This surge of black politicians running post-racial campaigns is new. But if Obama wins the White House we are going to see a major shift towards them,' said Caroline Heldman, a political scientist at California's Occidental College.</p> <p>Booker looks every inch the new black politician. He is handsome and young and wears dapper suits. He has an impressive educational background: a degree from Stanford and a Rhodes Scholar. He grew up in a mostly white town in New Jersey, the son of IBM executives.</p> <p>Yet here he is as the mayor of Newark, a city that, for much of America, has come to mean rampant crime and sprawling black ghettos. He is now turning it around. Booker has substantially reduced violent crime. He has reformed the police force and brought high-profile companies to the city. He is a relentlessly upbeat advocate for the city despite its reputation.</p> <p>That reputation was largely born in 1967. After rumours spread that white police had beaten a black taxi driver, riots broke out that cost 26 lives, injured more than 700 and saw the National Guard brought onto the streets. It resulted in the flight of the white middle class, leaving behind an impoverished black populace. Memories run deep here. Watching the plaque being unveiled was Atno Smith, who grew up near where the riot started. 'You call it a riot,' he said 'We call it a rebellion. You can call it a police riot if you like. Or a National Guard riot.'</p> <p>Such sentiments have been common in black American politics for a generation; defined by a sense of injustice and the notion that street protest was the best way to address black concerns. The TV image of Sharpton and Jackson leading a march to protest at a police shooting or a racially motivated murder has become a cultural signpost for modern American life. But Obama, Booker and others are seeking to change that. </p> <p>In his memorial speech, Booker outlined a post-racial future for black Americans and his constant theme was to move on from the civil rights era. 'We do not want these stories or these memories to overcome us and undermine us; to trap us in our history,' he said.</p> <p>That echoes the themes of Obama, who only openly addressed the issue of race when his pastor, the Rev Jeremiah Wright, became a damaging campaign issue after making comments including blaming America for the 11 September attacks and claiming the government had secretly invented HIV 'as a means of genocide against people of colour'. </p> <p>Indeed, Obama has been frequently at pains to call on black Americans to take responsibility for their lives. He has spoken at black churches and aggressively pushed the need for individual blacks, especially young fathers, to look after their families better. That theme has earned the ire of older figures such as Jackson, whose fury at Obama recently spilled out when a microphone in a TV studio picked up Jackson admitting he wanted to '... cut his nuts out'.</p> <p>The new generation of black politicians has forged on regardless and, to some extent, they have succeeded in removing race from their campaigns. When Paterson replaced Eliot Spitzer as New York's governor, much was made of the fact Paterson was blind. His race was rarely mentioned. Patrick and Franklin's paths to power unfolded in similar ways, with race playing little overt role. </p> <p>In many ways, these politicians reflect the emergence of a black middle class that has moved to the same suburbs as their white counterparts and works in the same professional jobs. A recent study for Radio One, a black broadcasting company, found huge generational discrepancies among black Americans. It found younger blacks in their thirties and forties were twice as likely to say society focused too much on black oppression as their parents' generation. They were also markedly more optimistic about the future.</p> <p>That attitude can be found even on the streets of Newark where the riots began. William Steele, who is black, said Booker had the right message: 'Cory Booker is just laying it out there. That what we need to do is just stand up. He is giving people a sense of responsibility that if you want some money, then you have to get out there and get a job. It does not matter if you are black or white.'</p> <p>It is not as easy as that. The truth is far more complex than a flood of newspaper headlines greeting the premature dawn of a non-racial future.</p> <p>It is certainly easy to find dissenting Newark voices, who believe the new black politicians are abandoning the real concerns of black people. Opposite the police station on which the memorial plaque now hangs, a large estate of new housing has been built. The area used to be a notorious 'project' but is now full of smart, tidy homes. To many that is a sign of progress, but not for Theresa Manning. She says Booker - and black politicians like him - have forgotten the poorest of the poor in her city in favour of embryonic gentrification. </p> <p>'They knock down a project where we live and then build these new houses. But we can't afford to live in them,' she said 'They are trying to [push] us out of Newark. But where we gonna go?'</p> <p>There is a fear that the declining influence of old-style black protest politics will mean the new black politicians will be able to ignore disadvantaged black communities or blame them for their own situation. But the fact is that black America is a very different world from the rest of the US. </p> <p>On average, black American men live seven years less than other racial groups. They are five times more likely to die of Aids. More than three times as many blacks live in prison cells than live in university halls. Many experts fear that electing Obama - or other political leaders - on a 'non-racial' basis would allow these issues to be swept under the carpet. 'There is a sense that this might be the potential downside of the triumph of tokenism,' said Devin Fergus, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University. </p> <p>Given the nature of the problems still facing black America, many black commentators believe there is still a justification for the confrontational, race-based politics of old hands such as Sharpton and Jackson. Indeed, it was noticeable in Obama's epic nomination battle with Hillary Clinton that establishment black politicians were far cooler about Obama than the black Democratic electorate. Many older black mayors, congressmen and senators ended up firmly in the Clinton camp or stayed on the sidelines until near the very end. 'People are worried that these post-racial politicians will not be able to forcibly address real black issues,' said Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Emory University who is writing a book on Booker.</p> <p>On the streets of America's inner cities, that same sentiment can be found, albeit expressed in simpler language. It often takes the form of a resentment of the education of the new black politicians and a belief that they do not understand what it means to be black in America. Obama has come under sustained criticism for his Hawaiian upbringing and his Kenyan - not black American - family background. Even in Newark, Booker is not immune. Manning is not shy about attacking what she sees as Booker's privileged upbringing in a wealthy white suburb. The vehemence of her words, delivered on a street corner as Booker prepared to get back in his SUV, jarred starkly with the positive post-racial rhetoric of the mayor's speech. 'Cory Booker did not know what it means to be black. He had to learn how to be black,' Manning said.</p> <p>Her words perhaps deliberately echoed a famous campaign taunt used by Booker's predecessor as mayor, Sharpe James. James, who ran Newark for two decades as a classic old-school black politician, once said of Booker: 'You have to learn how to be African-American and we don't have time to train you.' But how times have changed. Booker is now mayor and James has been jailed on corruption charges.</p> <p>In many black intellectual circles there is now a fierce argument over whether the new 'post-racial' campaigns are simply a means to an end - that sacrificing black identity politics will allow black leaders to better tackle racial injustice. Or are they, paradoxically, a bad thing for many poor black communities whose concerns could be abandoned.</p> <p>The jury is out. Critics say politicians such as Booker and Obama, by raising issues such as absent black fathers, are pandering to the racism of the white majority in order to win office. 'Some think the election of Obama could be a double-edged sword. Some of what he has said could give strength to those who falsely argue black Americans are marginalised by their own choices,' Fergus said. </p> <p>But others say the opposite. They say the new generation of black politicians simply want to make all their constituents' lives better and move beyond race. Getting elected first is key, they argue, because only then can they push for social change. 'It's only in office that black leaders can then begin to legislate,' Gillespie said.</p> <p>Perhaps an answer will emerge only if Obama wins the White House. That is a real possibility, undreamed of even two decades ago. But then America's racial politics are changing. Certainly few people 41 years ago, during the race riots in Newark, would have imagined that the first mayor to produce a memorial to them would be like Cory Booker: young, black, popular with whites and loved by the police. There are even whispers of much bigger things ahead in his political future. Even Manning had good words for the impact the mayor has had on a city that desperately needed help: 'I'll say this for Cory Booker. There isn't drugs being sold outside my house any more. I appreciate that.'</p>",
  "<p>South African president Thabo Mbeki flew to Harare last night as Zimbabwe's government and main opposition party appeared to be moving ever closer to a power-sharing agreement. </p> <p>Early reports suggest that President Robert Mugabe has agreed to opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai becoming Prime Minister, although the extent of his powers were still under discussion, a Zanu-PF official said last night. A breakthrough is believed to have been reached when Tsvangirai's opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), agreed to recognise Mugabe's legitimacy as President. Mugabe will meet Tsvangirai today to discuss forming a possible unity government.</p> <p>Mbeki, who is mediating the talks between Mugabe and Tsvangirai, is scheduled to meet both today, according to the state-run Herald newspaper in Zimbabwe. The move by Mbeki comes after two weeks of secretive negotiations in South Africa between representatives of Mugabe and Tsvangirai. Both claim that they are the rightful leader of Zimbabwe following two rounds of controversial presidential elections in March and June. </p> <p>A smaller opposition party, an offshoot of the MDC headed by Arthur Mutambara, is also involved in the negotiations. Mugabe and Tsvangirai are bitter rivals, and their meeting in Harare on 21 July was their first face-to-face encounter in a decade. South Africa's respected Business Day newspaper said yesterday that the political leaders were due to hold make-or-break talks today. </p> <p>Reports from South Africa have suggested that Mbeki is pushing for a power-sharing deal that would see Mugabe remain as President, but only in a ceremonial role, with Tsvangirai running the country as Prime Minister. </p> <p>A quick political settlement is seen as the key to halting Zimbabwe's deepening socio-economic crisis. Inflation is running at 2.2 million per cent, and a quarter of the population is reliant on food aid. Humanitarian agencies have been operating under heavy restrictions since early June, when the government accused them of favouring the opposition. Complicating the negotiations is the strong influence that the army and police chiefs have over Mugabe. These forces were responsible for the campaign of violence and intimidation against supporters of the MDC during the election period.</p> <p>Analysts say that senior security officials will not agree to a deal without a blanket amnesty to protect them from international prosecution. Tsvangirai, who defeated Mugabe in the first round of elections but pulled out of the run-off because of the escalating violence, has said that he is willing to work with moderate Zanu-PF officials but not to share power directly with Mugabe. He also wants fresh elections to be held within two years.</p> <p>Mbeki is desperate to secure a political agreement. In recent years he has come under heavy criticism, both internationally and at home, for pursuing a policy of quiet diplomacy regarding neighbouring Zimbabwe. </p> <p>But Mbeki has said that denunciations and sanctions - broadly speaking, the tactics of the West towards Mugabe and his cronies - only served to further antagonise the government.</p>",
  "<p>The Caucasus is the kind of place where, when the guns start firing, it's hard to stop them. That is the brutal reality of South Ossetia, where a small conflict is beginning to spread exponentially.</p> <p>Leave aside the geopolitics for the moment and have pity for the people who will suffer most from this, the citizens - mostly ethnic Ossetians but also Georgians - who have already died in their hundreds. It is a tiny and vulnerable place, with no more than 75,000 inhabitants of both nationalities mixed up in a patchwork of villages and one sleepy provincial town in the foothills of the Caucasus. </p> <p>Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili seems to care less about these people than about asserting that they live in Georgian territory. Otherwise he would not on the night of 7-8 August have launched a massive artillery assault on the town of Tskhinvali, which has no purely military targets and whose residents, the Georgians say, lest we forget, are their own citizens. This is a blatant breach of international humanitarian law. </p> <p>Moscow cares as little about the Ossetians as it does the Georgians it is bombing, regarding South Ossetia as a pawn in its bid to bring Georgia and its neighbours back into a Russian sphere of influence. Ordinary South Ossetians have also been cursed by a criminalised leadership which would long ago have lost power had they not been the rallying point for defence against Georgia.</p> <p>This conflict was entirely avoidable. Its origin lies in one of the many majority-minority disputes that accompanied the break-up of the Soviet Union. The Ossetians, a divided people with one part living on the Russian north side of the Caucasus, the other in Georgia, generally felt more comfortable with Russian rule than in a new post-Soviet Georgian state. A small nasty war with Tbilisi in 1990-91 cost 1,000 lives and left huge bitterness.</p> <p>But outside high politics, ethnic relations were never bad. For a decade after South Ossetia's de facto secession from Georgia in 1991, it was a shady backwater and smugglers' haven. It was outside nominal Georgian control, but Ossetians and Georgians went back and forth and traded vigorously with one another at an untaxed market in the village of Ergneti. </p> <p>Then Saakashvili came to power in 2004 with heady promises to restore his country's lost territories. He closed the Ergneti market and tried to cut off South Ossetia, triggering a summer of violence. Modelling himself on the medieval Georgian king David the Builder, he said Georgian territorial integrity would be re-established by the end of his presidency. He has sought to tear up the imperfect Russian-framed negotiating framework for South Ossetia, but has not come up with a viable alternative. </p> <p>For their part, the Russians upped the stakes and baited Saakashvili, their b\u00eate noire, by effecting a soft annexation of South Ossetia. Moscow handed out Russian passports to the South Ossetians and installed Russian officials in government posts there. Russian soldiers, notionally peacekeepers, have acted as an informal occupying army.</p> <p>Saakashvili is a famously volatile risk-taker, veering between warmonger and peacemaker, democrat and autocrat. On several occasions international officials have pulled him back from the brink. On a visit to Washington in 2004, he received a tongue-lashing from then Secretary of State Colin Powell who told him to act with restraint. Two months ago, he could have triggered a war with his other breakaway province of Abkhazia by calling for the expulsion of Russian peacekeepers from there, but European diplomats persuaded him to step back. This time he has yielded to provocation and stepped over the precipice. </p> <p>The provocation is real, but the Georgian President is rash to believe this is a war he can win or that the West wants it. Both George Bush and John McCain have visited Georgia, made glowing speeches praising Saakashvili and were rewarded with the Order of St George. But Bush, at least in public, is now bound to be cautious, calling for a ceasefire.</p> <p>The reaction in much of Europe will be much less forgiving. Even before this crisis, a number of governments, notably France and Germany, were reporting 'Georgia fatigue'. Though they broadly wished the Saakashvili government well, they did not buy the line that he was a model democrat - the sight last November of his riot police tear-gassing protesters in Tbilisi and smashing up an opposition TV station dispelled that illusion. And they have a long agenda of issues with Russia, which they regard as more important than the post-Soviet quarrel between Moscow and Tbilisi. Paris and Berlin will now say they were right to urge caution on Georgia's Nato ambitions at the Bucharest Nato summit. </p> <p>Both sides are behaving badly. It is outrageous that Russia is seizing the chance to attack Georgian towns and airfields. Dozens of Georgian civilians are now dying too. But Georgia needs to be restrained, for its own sake. Otherwise Saakashvili looks set to lose both the economic stability he has achieved and hope of Nato membership. He already looks now to have forfeited his other lost territory of Abkhazia and the prospect of return there for the quarter of a million Georgians who fled the region during the 1992-93 war. Now it looks as though the Abkhaz are going on the offensive, taking the opportunity to tell the world that they will never return to Georgian rule. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Thomas de Waal is Caucasus Editor at the Institute for War and Peace Reporting in London</p>",
  "<p>So there the world was, thinking that Paris Hilton was a vapid young woman with an over-inflated sense of her own importance and as fitting a symbol as one could find of the phenomenon of consumocelebritydom (celebrity as the final, logical conclusion of rank consumerism. Although maybe it's the other way round). Then, she goes and makes a piece of biting political satire that rocks John McCain's campaign to the core.</p> <p>Who could have predicted that? Not McCain's team, evidently, who used her image in an advertisement which accused Barack Obama of being 'the biggest celebrity in the world' and, therefore, by association, about as likely a leader of the free world as, say, Paris Hilton only for her to take umbrage in the most devastating way possible: by appearing in a video spoof made by the comedy website, Funny or Die, which has been seen, so far, by more than six million people.</p> <p>And here's the funny thing. It is actually funny. In it, she accuses McCain of being 'The Oldest Celebrity in the World', like, totally, and proposes a solution to the US's energy needs that blends Obama's and McCain's policies. 'Energy crisis solved. I'll see you at the debate, bitches.'</p> <p>What next? A Page 3 glamour model once best known for her unfeasibly large breasts writing for the opinion pages of the Times? Oh no, my mistake, that was last week when Jordan - or Katie Price - took her beef against the nightclub Chinawhite and the Cartier Polo Tournament not to the Daily Star but 'wrote' a polemic for the Times. In it she explained how she had paid \u00a36,000 for a table but was later told that 'I was not the sort of person they wanted', and in transferring the argument to the broadsheets managed to make the entire polo establishment seem like a bunch of class-bound buffoons.</p> <p>Now she may not have actually written it (she has a very good ghost called Rebecca Farnworth who churns out her bestsellers for her), any more than Paris 'wrote' her little skit, but do you honestly think that when you see pieces by Gordon Brown or David Cameron in the newspapers that they actually write them? Of course not. Why do you think they employ so many flunkeys if not to write things they then pass off as their own? (In GCSEs, this is known as 'cheating'.)</p> <p>But back to Paris. If I was McCain, I would cede the election now out of sheer embarrassment. If you can be bested by a woman who became famous chiefly for going to parties and appearing in a pornographic home video, what is the point? Although it must give hope to Gordon Brown. Davids Cameron and Miliband might yet be brought down by Chantelle Houghton and Jodie Marsh respectively.</p> <p>More than this, what it shows is how far the establishment still has to go in understanding the ways of the modern world; that popular culture is a greater force than they will ever be and it is to be learnt from, not controlled. McCain's ad showed Obama amid the cheering crowds of Berlin and called him 'The Biggest Celebrity in the World' as if 'celebrity' were a pejorative. Like, hello? Did they really need Paris Hilton to point out that this is no longer the case? And actually never was - do they really think that Ronald Reagan was elected for his great intellect and savoir-faire? </p> <p>The fact is that Davids Cameron and Miliband could probably learn a great deal from Ms Houghton and Ms Marsh. David M: think on Chantelle's Big Brother win; don't be seen to stab your best friend in the back. And David C: don't get too big for your boots; you're the political equivalent of a glamour model from Essex. Popular, but only likeable under strictly controlled conditions.

  "<p>This week Barack Obama is enjoying a brief respite from the campaign madhouse on the beaches of Hawaii. But the madness itself never pauses, of course. As Obama departed for the state where he grew up, the Republican Party sent him off with a 'Travel Guide' mocking the upscale prep school Obama attended. A McCain campaign supporter marvelled that Obama would be 'swimming' while Americans grappled with high gas prices. And McCain sent him off with a new round of attack ads focusing on Obama's allegedly Paris Hilton-esque celebrity glow. 'Life in the spotlight must be grand,' explains one. 'But for the rest of us, times are tough.'</p> <p>Petty and churlish, perhaps, but a growing number of Democrats suspect that relentless attacks by McCain and the Republican party may be taking a toll on Obama. Indeed, despite the political tailwinds at Obama's back, and the smooth execution of his vaunted overseas tour last month, he maintains a conspicuously modest lead over his Republican rival. And even as the Obama brand underperforms, the McCain brand is overperforming: The Arizona senator is faring much better than one would reasonably expect of a determined Iraq war supporter and faithful ally of George Bush in the ugly sunset of the post-9/11 Republican era. When Obama and McCain head to their parties' conventions this month, Obama must find a way to change that dynamic, or risk seeing his fragile lead slip away. </p> <p>Ever since he dispatched Hillary Clinton, Obama has held that steady but slim advantage over McCain. According to the running average of major presidential polls, Obama now leads McCain by 3.6 points. That is nothing to sneer at. Remember: George W Bush actually lost the popular vote in 2000 and still took the presidency after winning more electoral votes than Al Gore (with some help from the US Supreme Court). And by most counts Obama enjoys a substantial edge in the state-by-state electoral count. He is, by any measure, winning.</p> <p>Yet as seen in another context - the overall mood of the electorate - Obama's lead is decidedly underwhelming. Asked to state their generic preference for Congressional candidates, voters say they prefer Democrats to Republicans by a roughly 10-point margin. In other words, Obama is lagging behind his party's overall brand by about seven points. McCain, by contrast, runs ahead of his fellow Republicans by about five points. This most unusual situation gives Republicans an improbable glimmer of hope at a time when their party name is almost synonymous with incompetence and corruption.</p> <p>Most striking, perhaps, is the gulf between how voters see McCain and the Republican party's titular leader, Bush. The President's approval ratings are now hovering just below 30 per cent, yet polls show McCain drawing an average of 43 per cent.</p> <p>This is too close for comfort. Conditions in Iraq are steadily improving. The US economy may have hit bottom, and with oil and gas prices dropping and even the dollar inching back up, it's possible voter bitterness towards Republicans will subside enough to let McCain sneak into office.</p> <p>How can this be? One reason involves the familiar forces dragging at Obama. He is relatively young and inexperienced - and, as you may have noticed, dark-skinned and bears a name not likely to be found in many small-town-America phone books.</p> <p>Less discussed are the reasons why McCain is faring so much better than his party. The answer lies in McCain's public identity. It is premised on his reputation as a different kind of Republican - a 'maverick', an independent crusader willing to challenge his own party on principled grounds. McCain deservedly earned this reputation in the late '90s, when he battled Republican leaders on issues such as tobacco regulation and campaign finance reform; and during his 2000 campaign, when he railed against Wall Street and religious-right leaders. McCain once even cast himself as Luke Skywalker battling through the Death Star - his party's corrupt establishment.</p> <p>But to win the Republican nomination, McCain has had to recast his identity. He has embraced Bush's enormous tax cuts, which he once opposed. He has dropped his critiques of religious leaders such as Jerry Falwell. He has largely abandoned his anti-corporate rhetoric. On the Iraq war McCain has expressed only tactical differences with the President. And during the 2004 campaign, McCain was a crucial supporter of Bush. As McCain himself recently put it: 'On the transcendent issues, the most important issues of our day, I've been totally in agreement and support of President Bush.'</p> <p>And yet many an American voter knows little of this recent history. An admiring press spent far more time building up McCain's image as an independent maverick than it has explaining his new Politburo persona.</p> <p>Some Americans may simply admire McCain's past as a Vietnam veteran and prisoner of war who valiantly refused early release from captivity. But to date the Obama Democrats have been far too delicate about spotlighting McCain's political mythology. To be fair, they have been preoccupied with the reasonable goal of introducing their unconventional candidate to middle America. There was the television ad noting Obama's white maternal family; the recent recalibrations on issues such as domestic wiretapping and gun control; and the big 'patriotism' speech assuring voters (who may have seen otherwise on the internet) that, yes, Obama loves America.</p> <p>The Democratic national convention in Denver at the end of August is the moment to change this tone once and for all. As Jonathan Chait recently noted in the Los Angeles Times, John Kerry's team erred in 2004 by focusing his party's convention almost exclusively around their candidate without targeting Bush's weaknesses. While they command America's attention in Denver, the Democrats should hammer McCain with a new degree of vigour. The Obama campaign finally began that process last week, with a pair of negative ads tying McCain to Bush. But the counterattack must be intensified. The goal must be to convince voters that McCain really is just like any other Republican - part of the 30 per cent ghetto with Bush. During one debate with Hillary Clinton, Obama memorably cracked that McCain's 'Straight Talk Express' campaign bus had lost its wheels. This clever formulation should be a Democratic mantra. They need to drive home that McCain is in line with his party on tax rates for the wealthy, on the size of government, on war in Iraq. That he has described the social security system as a 'disgrace', and supports a highly unpopular Republican plan to privatise the system. And that, although he has spoken out against the fraud and corruption of recent years, he is part and parcel of the machine that enabled his party's perversions.</p> <p>Obama and company will have to walk a tricky line, however. Party conventions should be generally upbeat and focused around the candidate's best qualities. And Obama himself looks best floating above the muddy scrum and extolling his politics of hope. Much of the dirty work will have to be left to surrogates - other prominent Democrats who can twist the knife into McCain, preferably with a smile. Bill and Hillary Clinton are fine candidates - never mind that they may be secretly rooting for Obama's defeat this autumn. (Hillary 2012!) Or perhaps members of the Kennedy family, who will command particular attention for the tragic reason of Senator Ted Kennedy's brain cancer, can implore America to see McCain for what he truly is.</p> <p>This effort will have to continue past Denver, of course. Obama's task will be complicated by the absence of a strong attack-dog infrastructure of the sort other recent presidential candidates have enjoyed. He actively discouraged the work of independent, largely unregulated groups which, in 2004, turned huge campaign contributions into notoriously harsh national advertising. But without them providing air support, Obama's team has no choice but to fight a nastier ground war on their own.</p> <p>Obama has been in this position before. Late in 2007, pundits and supporters complained that he was not waging a tough enough campaign against Hillary Clinton. He first counselled patience, then sharpened his tone, and the rest is history. The difference is that Obama was trailing then and is leading now. He may be tempted to cruise along at a high altitude - particularly given his personal disdain for negative politics. But the fact is that he can't afford to. When Democrats arrive in Denver two weeks from now, they should be ready to throw a party. But they must also be ready to throw some heavy punches.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Michael Crowley is senior editor at New Republic magazine and The Observer's chief American commentator.

But in the US, it was virtually impossible to libel even a live public figure!</p> <p>But then I discovered that this was much less significant than I thought, since the US media is normally so deferential of politicians that one almost admires the <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=5441195&amp;page=1\">National Enquirer</a> \u2013 not least because it <a href=\"http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/usage/enquire\">knows the difference</a> between \"inquire\" and \"enquire\".</p> <p>One can see why so many of the supermarket tabloid reporters were refugees from British media law, where a judge can rule a story about the former British fascist leader's son having S&amp;M with prostitutes as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jul/24/mosley.privacy\">an invasion of privacy</a>. He did not deny the story as such \u2013 but simply said it was none of the press's business. Nor was it.</p> <p>When British Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown and former Foreign Secretary Robin Cook were outed for having affairs with their secretaries, they fessed up and their popularity rose. But note the difference.</p> <p>Unlike their British counterparts, the National Enquirer did not make stories up. When <a href=\"http://www.americanheritage.com/people/articles/web/20070508-gary-hart-donna-rice-george-mcgovern-democratic-presidential-primary-political-scandal.shtml\">Gary Hart</a> told them to bring it on: they did. When Bill Clinton denied Gennifer Flowers, they got him. And now <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080808/ap_on_el_pr/edwards_affair\">John Edwards is admitting</a> they got him as well. And they all dissimulated. Extra-marital sex may be one of the fringe benefits of political life, but getting caught in the lie outright could be fatal.</p> <p>Even so, the hypocrisy of Democratic party leaders now working out how to keep Edwards off the podium at their convention does show double standards. They would certainly welcome former President Bill Clinton up there, whom the Enquirer also got bang to rights, as it were. Even more tellingly, when did Newt Gingrich ever lack for a platform in the party of family values and the religious right despite his trying to bully his wife into more favourable divorce terms in her cancer recovery ward?</p> <p>John McCain himself divorced the wife who had stayed married to him during the years he spent in a Vietnamese prison, and married into the money that now helps bankroll his political ambitions. Rudy Giuliani, while mayor of New York, announced his divorce at a press conference without telling his wife beforehand. Neither of these men seems to have suffered politically within the party of the teenage abstinence, familial integrity and marital fidelity.</p> <p>A senior UN official once asked another official why I had not carried a story about his affair with his secretary, since I knew about it. The accurate reply was I saw no public - that is, civic - interest. He was not committing any crime and had not made a public career of parading family values and feigned Pauline Christian morality. It was irresistible to gossip about in the bar of the Delegates' Lounge, but entirely resistible to write about it. \"Let him who is without sin cast the first stone\", is the relevant text.</p> <p>American law does not protect privacy, unlike European law, but it certainly has a point in excluding public figures from libel protection. On a pragmatic point, people who run for public office should be savvy enough to do the Caesar's wife thing. How can you expect someone who is indiscreet enough to get caught to run a superpower, with its necessary lies and secrets?</p> <p>In addition, hypocrisy should always be the subject of journalists' attention. Lying and then getting caught out will always prolong the media attention. Take a tip from Rudy and Newt, be brazen in your hypocrisy, and even the religious right will forget about it in a very short time.</p>"
