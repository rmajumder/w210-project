  "<p>Welcome to this blog's new home. I'll post here briefly on Saturday morning (US time), before boarding a plane from Washington to Denver for the Democratic convention. As soon as we take off, Barack Obama will announce his vice-presidential pick; it'll be a stunningly unexpected surprise choice, and there will be an enormous amount of excitement, and the candidate and his running-mate will make a sensational joint appearance in Springfield, Illinois, but I will miss all this because I will be out of cellphone contact, eating mini-pretzels from a bag.</p> <p>I'll be blogging here during the conventions, and liveblogging the big speeches: join me and together we can count the number of times Obama says \"change\" and John McCain says \"Czechoslovakia\". I'll also be writing a morning email briefing from Denver and Minneapolis-St Paul with the latest news from the conventions, plus details of features, interviews and analysis from the Guardian's unrivalled team of reporters and commentators, and a roundup of the best of the blogosphere and the US media.

  "<p>John Lewis, the department store chain seen as a barometer of Britain's retail sector, said its latest weekly sales took a hit as shoppers were distracted by the Olympics and school exam results.</p> <p>The employee-owned chain said yesterday that sales in the week to August 16 at its 26 UK stores fell by 4.2% - the 10th week in 15 that sales have suffered as consumers cut back on spending because of higher fuel, food and mortgage costs and economic uncertainty.</p> <p>John Lewis said sales were particularly subdued because of distractions such as sporting events and A-Level results. Out-of-town stores such as those at Bluewater and Cribbs Causeway, Bristol, had another poor week, while the online business showed good growth.</p> <p>The retailer's plight echoes that of many high street shops. While like-for-like sales at John Lewis have held up fairly well in the face of a possible recession, Marks &amp; Spencer, Next and Laura Ashley have endured hefty falls.</p> <p>Sellers of higher-priced goods such as furniture and white goods are suffering the most because fewer people are moving home as the housing market weakens rapidly.</p> <p>Official figures this week showed a surprise rise in retail sales last month, but they were greeted with scepticism by economists.</p> <p>John Lewis's subdued performance was driven by falls in the home category as well as in electrical goods and home technology. </p> <p>At the group's 189 Waitrose supermarkets sales increased 2.3%. Total sales fell 0.3% to \u00a3119.6m.</p>",
  "<h2>Bhutto's husband put forward as next president</h2> <p>The main ruling Pakistan People's party yesterday proposed the husband of assassinated ex-premier Benazir Bhutto as the country's next president. The move makes Asif Ali Zardari the clear frontrunner to fill the leadership vacuum created by the resignation of General Pervez Musharraf on Monday. But it could also hasten the collapse of a ruling coalition that has struggled to tackle the growing strength of Taliban militants. Pakistan's election commission announced that federal and provincial leaders will elect Musharraf's successor in a vote on 6 September. <br><strong>Associated Press in Islamabad</strong></p> <h2>Pro-cleric supporters protest over security deal</h2> <p>Several thousand supporters of anti-American Shia Muslim cleric Muqtada al-Sadr protested yesterday against an emerging US-Iraqi security agreement, saying it would turn Iraq into a US colony. The march in the southern city of Kufa came a day after US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice met with Iraqi leaders in Baghdad to discuss the deal. Under a draft agreement, US combat troops would pull out of major cities by next June and leave Iraq by 2011, according to officials. Al-Sadr, who lives in Iran but retains significant political clout in Iraq, strongly opposes the US military presence. <br><strong>Associated Press in Baghdad</strong></p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and John McCain might not admit it, but presidential conventions are a lot like beauty pageants. From the lavish decor to the gaudy outfits, conventions are staged to crown a Mr America who will carry his party's banner into the autumn election. Almost everything is scripted in advance, right down to the vote on the convention floor that formally anoints the nominees.</p> <p>Why go to such great lengths - $70m (\u00a338m) is being spent by the Democrats on their Denver affair next week - when everyone knows who the respective belles of the respective balls are? TV coverage of the 2004 conventions drew an average of 21 million viewers, and this year's events promise to lure even more, many of them unsure about who to vote for in November.</p> <p>Held in the late summer, after primary contests have chosen two presidential hopefuls, the conventions typically boost tourism for their host cities and polling performance for the candidates. More than 4,400 delegates, some of them super, representing each of the 50 states, Washington and a handful of US territories, are heading to the Democratic shop window in Denver, along with 15,000 members of the media and untold thousands of protesters. </p> <p>But conventions aren't all balloons, and orchestras playing God Bless America. The party platforms, detailed outlines of policy goals that are haggled over in advance, will be approved amid the hoopla. Candidates for lower office will show up to meet new fundraisers, and business lobbyists will show up to curry favour with those candidates.</p> <p>Until the 1830s, congressmen chose the presidential nominees in camera. Conventions were conceived to allow non-Washington elites to participate in the process, but the horse-trading and infighting between political factions hardly diminished. Before the age of TV cameras and bloggers, party bosses could freely wheel and deal on the convention floor to secure victory for their preferred candidates, creating memorable fights and long rounds of voting.</p> <p>In 1924, it took 103 ballots for the Democrats to settle on John Davis - who went on to lose to Calvin Coolidge. Wendell Willkie won the 1940 Republican nomination in six ballots, but only after the Philadelphia police prevented his rival's supporters from throwing punches on the convention floor. The most famous melee occurred at 1968 Democratic convention, when young liberals alienated by the Vietnam war rioted in the streets of Chicago to protest the defeat of anti-war presidential challenger Eugene McCarthy. </p> <p>One famous McCarthy backer, though she did not protest in Chicago, was Hillary Clinton, who won the right to a symbolic nomination in Denver next week but has promised not to upstage the Obama spectacular.</p> <p>While the main event is staged inside an arena, with a long roster of speakers promoting the candidates' agendas, hundreds of private galas take place off the convention floor. </p> <p>Hollywood star sightings are also a convention ritual: Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were at the 2004 Democratic convention; and Denver will play host to Susan Sarandon, Kanye West, and other Obama fans.</p>",

Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> According to its marketing literature, The Residences at 2211 Camelback, an upmarket apartment building in Phoenix, Arizona, is \"a dream within a dream environment,\" where \"life beyond the expected awaits your discovery\". An \"ambience of distinction embraces residents and their guests upon arrival and rewards them with soaring architecture [and] a bountiful treasure of luxury amenities that ensure personal comfort\". There's a fitness centre, business facilities and a boardroom, a massage service, and a rooftop pool terrace with a sun deck and spa, offering \"majestic mountain views,\" all just yards away from \"couture boutique shopping, exquisite dining [and] championship golf\". If John McCain does not win the US presidency this November, his two combined units at 2211 Camelback might provide a consoling setting in which to reflect upon why. So might his ranch on the banks of a creek in Sedona, a couple of hours' drive away, which has three houses on it, or his three-bedroom apartment in Virginia. Or one of a number of other hideaways - the exact number, of course, being precisely McCain's biggest problem at the moment.</p> <p>Whether or not it ends up proving decisive in the outcome of the election, McCain's admission in an interview this week that he does not know how many homes he owns - \"I'll have my staff get to you,\" he promised a reporter for the Washington-based website Politico - certainly had many of the qualities of the perfect political gaffe. Like the first president Bush acting stunned by a supermarket checkout scanner, or John Kerry going windsurfing, it threatened to demolish McCain's man-of-the-people credentials - an especially awkward matter in a campaign in which charges of elitism have been flung about so energetically, and in which winning the votes of struggling lower-middleclass Americans in key swing states is seen as crucial to victory. (It didn't help that McCain, days earlier, had suggested that only those with an income of \u00a33m or more really counted as \"rich\".) </p> <p>Helpfully for Barack Obama, it also raised another theme, one that the Democratic candidate's campaign team felt unable to broach in the attack advertisement they launched within hours: the idea that McCain, who will soon turn 72, is growing so forgetful that he can't recall basic facts about himself.</p> <p>To be fair, the truth about McCain's homes, which are mainly owned by his heiress wife, Cindy (pictured with him, above), or by companies she controls, is complex. To paraphrase Bill Clinton, who arrived at the White House having never owned any home at all, it depends on what the meaning of the word \"home\" is. Do the knocked-together units at 2211 Camelback, worth about $1.7m (\u00a3920,000), count as one or two? </p> <p>Cindy McCain certainly owns a $1m condominium unit in La Jolla, California, overlooking the Pacific Ocean, but it's reportedly occupied by an elderly aunt. A loft-style apartment in Phoenix features \"a giant silver chimney\" extending from the fireplace to ceiling \"about 20ft above,\" one reporter noted - but it was bought for McCain's daughter Meghan. \"The reality is they have some investment properties and stuff,\" McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers told the Washington Post. \"It's not as if he lives in 10 houses. That's just not the case. The reality is they have four that actually could be considered houses they could use.\"</p> <p>The McCain properties, worth an estimated $13m in total, demonstrate a striking homogeneity in their architecture and locations. Counting 2211 Camelback as a single residence, three of them are in Phoenix, or not too far away. Five are apartments in modern tower blocks, and three overlook the Pacific Ocean. Two are in Coronado, near San Diego in California. (Last year, Cindy McCain told San Diego Magazine she comes to the area \"any time I get a chance to\".) </p> <p>The most distinctive is probably the McCain ranch in Sedona, where McCain played host to several potential vice-presidential candidates earlier in the campaign, though the description of it as a \"ranch\" sometimes irritates his opponents. \"McCain doesn't graze cattle or sheep,\" the liberal Arizona blogger David Safier wrote recently. \"He doesn't sell meat or wool. He has about 15 acres of land in Oak Creek near Sedona with a large vacation home ... and about six smaller guest houses... 'Ranch' evokes images of cowboys and horses and cattle roundups ... it makes McCain and [President George] Bush seem like virile, independent men of the land.\"</p> <p>In fact, Bush only purchased Prairie Chapel Ranch - his beloved \"Western White House\" in Crawford, Texas, where he entertains world leaders and relaxes by clearing brush - in 1999.</p> <p>Nevertheless, accusations of housing-related elitism tend to work more effectively in US politics when levelled against Democrats: rightwing wealth, it's implied, is the result of vigorous capitalist success, whereas liberal wealth is hypocritical, suggestive of out-of-touch elitism and feyness - and so it remains to be seen whether McCain's remarks will hurt him to the degree that Kerry was damaged by attacks on his family's home ownership in 2004. </p> <p>In purely factual terms, the two cases are remarkably similar: Kerry, as Republicans took much delight in noting, had the use of at least five homes, again mostly owned by his heiress wife. One of them, notoriously, was a 1485 barn that had been shipped over piece-by-piece from England to Idaho - although not by Kerry but by his wife's former husband, John Heinz III, a Republican. </p> <p>Obama certainly does not live in penury, something upon which the McCain campaign was quick to try to capitalise in the wake of their candidate's gaffe. Obama owns a large redbrick home in Kenwood, a neighbourhood of Chicago, which may or may not be \"a frickin' mansion\" - as Rogers described it - but which does have four fireplaces and a wine cellar. And purchasing it did involve Obama in dealings with the disgraced Chicago businessman Tony Rezko, a donor to his campaign, though the candidate has insisted that he paid well above market price and received no favours. (A McCain ad released on Thursday referred to the Rezko connection as Obama's own \"housing problem\".) Obama also rents a second-floor apartment in a townhouse in the Capitol Hill neighbourhood of Washington DC. </p> <p>As so often in this election season, though, the McCain campaign response ended up sounding peevish, like a playground taunt hurriedly constructed in an attempt to turn Obama's own words against him. \"Does a guy who made more than $4m last year, just got back from a vacation on a private beach in Hawaii and bought his own million-dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses?\" Rogers asked. McCain \"is a guy who lived in one house for five and half years - in prison in Vietnam\".</p> <p>Rezko was not a convicted felon at the time, of course (and, incidentally, there are no private beaches in Hawaii). On the other hand, some of the McCain family's homes may have been smart investment decisions, and their total number really is a question of definition. But it's perception that matters - and the appalling impression made by McCain left his campaign, last night, in the curious position of looking forward to the wall-to-wall media coverage that Obama's vice-presidential announcement was bound to generate: at least it promised to change the subject.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's Olympic medal winners should be awarded honours when they return home, Gordon Brown said yesterday, as he pledged to turn Team GB's successes into a decade of sporting triumphs.</p> <p>The prime minister said he was confident that Britain's accomplishments in Beijing would secure greater private sector investment in the London games and lead to a doubling of investment in British sport by 2012. \"Everyone wants to play their part in making the Olympics a success,\" he said. </p> <p>Brown's arrival in Beijing came as it emerged the Chinese authorities have detained a Briton for 10 days for her part in a Free Tibet protest. Downing Street said it did not comment \"on individual consulate cases\". But it is understood the prime minister has taken up Mandie McKeown's case amid a flurry of activity behind the scenes. Police detained McKeown, 41, as she videoed three fellow activists unfurling a banned Tibetan flag near the Bird's Nest stadium yesterday. The men, a German of Tibetan origin and two Americans, are also thought to have been detained.</p> <p>Earlier, Brown said he would be bringing forward an \"incentive plan\" in the next few weeks to encourage business sponsorship of British sport. A government source said ministers were expecting \"something of a bidding war\" between companies wanting to sponsor Britain's champion athletes.</p> <p>\"The challenge now is to turn what has been two weeks of great success into 10 years of sporting triumph for our country,\" Brown said. \"I will leave no stone unturned in my determination to make London 2012 a great success.\"</p> <p>Asked whether he wanted to see honours awarded to medal-winning members of Team GB, Brown said: \"That's a matter for the Queen. I think the country will want to see our athletes honoured and the country will want to celebrate their success and give them the permanent recognition they deserve.\" </p> <p>Brown singled out the 2008 cycling champions Chris Hoy and Rebecca Romero, 400 metres runner Christine Ohuruogu and swimmer Rebecca Adlington for praise. \"Rebecca Romero's story is amazing,\" he said. \"Not content to win a silver medal in Athens in 2004, she decided to change sports.\"</p> <p>Romero gave up rowing in favour of cycling after failing to get the gold in the women's quadruple sculls in Greece four years ago. She becomes the first British woman to win Olympic medals at two separate sports and only the second British competitor ever, alongside Cardiff-born Paulo Radmilovic, who won gold medals at water polo and in the 4x200m freestyle in 1908.</p> <p>After the 2004 games in Athens, Tony Blair used the last set of honours before the 2005 election to reward successful British athletes.</p> <p>Brown said Britain needed to extend its domination in sports such as rowing, cycling and swimming and make further breakthroughs in sports like gymnastics.</p> <p>The government aims to spend \u00a3600m on sport in the run-up to the 2012 Olympics. Brown met the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing yesterday, where he praised the \"spectacular success\" of the Olympics. \"With the whole world watching, the Olympic Games have captured the imagination of the whole global community,\" he said. \"The 2008 Beijing Olympics have set a new standard for the Olympic Games which we in London in 2012 will seek to follow.\"</p> <p>Brown also spoke to Hu about China's stance on Zimbabwe and Darfur, where it has been criticised for supporting repressive regimes. \"He responded by saying that these are issues that will be part of our continuing discussions,\" Brown said. He also raised the issue of Tibet, urging a \"productive\" conclusion to talks with the Dalai Lama's representatives.</p> <p>Brown told reporters he hoped that the temporary relaxation of the ban on some internet sites while the Olympics was on could be made permanent. Britain's success in Beijing has taken some of the pressure off Brown, who has faced a barrage of criticism over his leadership this summer following a number of policy U-turns, dire poll ratings, and a string of byelection defeats.</p>",
  "<p>As almost everyone in at least two hemispheres knows, next week's Democratic party convention will be the most important four days so far in the life of Barack Obama. Having just barely regained some footing after two disastrous weeks in which he took a beach holiday while enduring a barrage of Republican attacks and saw his lead over John McCain vaporise, Obama arrives in Denver with his future on the line.</p> <p>But another prominent figure has a lot at stake, too. For Howard Dean, the Democratic party chairman who will oversee the proceedings in the Rocky mountain city, it's not so much about his own future, but his party's future and his legacy as a political leader.</p> <p>In his three and a half years on the job, Dean has dramatically departed from the traditional role of a US party chairman. Despite the lofty title, historically the chairman has been a glorified bursar. Their job has been to raise money, placate the donors and otherwise keep a low profile. </p> <p>But Dean has done it differently. He has been a mediocre fundraiser. What he has tried to do instead is transform the thinking inside the party. And he's done better at that than many sceptics would ever have thought.</p> <p>\"I hope we've changed the way we do Democratic politics in this country,\" Dean told the Guardian. \"And I think it will lead to the election of Barack Obama as president.\" If it does, Dean will have to go down as one of the most innovative and successful Democratic chairmen of the last 50 years.</p> <p>The 59-year-old's journey has been an improbable one. He grew up in a Republican family in the poshest of posh surroundings - New York City's upper east side and the Hamptons. He went to Yale, famously requesting, in his first year, that he be assigned to live with a black roommate. His medical training took him to Vermont where, in 1980, he led a successful campaign to halt the construction of a condominium building (he wanted a bicycle trail). He entered politics and, like so many before and after him, got the bug. He became the state's lieutenant governor, cutting ribbons and attending funerals. But then, in 1991, the governor died. Suddenly Dean was one of 50 elite politicians in the US. </p> <p>He was a moderate and even penny-pinching governor, not considered a liberal at all. But as he watched the country's radical swing to the right under George Bush, he inched left. The story from there is more familiar. The failed presidential campaign. The infamous Iowa scream, which haunts him still on late-night talk shows. The penchant for deeply impolitic statements (\"I hate the Republicans\"). The emergence, due to conservatives' repetition, of his name as a synonym for elitist, latte-sipping, gay-loving, America-bashing liberalism. </p> <p>Those attacks endeared him to the party's core constituencies. After John Kerry lost to Bush in 2004, the time came to select a new party chairman. Dean was one of seven candidates. The big party leaders - Senate majority leader Harry Reid, House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi and others - were mortified at the prospect of this radioactive presence becoming the titular leader of their party. </p> <p>But there was nothing they could do about it. The party chairman is chosen by national committee members - party activists spread across the country. These people, livid at their leadership for blowing another election with their pusillanimity and caution, loved Dean's in-your-face, partisan style. In February 2005, they made him chairman.</p> <p>The pre-Dean practice in the party had been built on two foundations. First, that electing a president is really all that mattered (as opposed to, say, building the party at grassroots level). Second, that the way to elect a president is concentrate on a handful of \"swing states,\" such as Ohio, Florida and Michigan, not worry about states that were already Democratic, such as New York, and write off all the Republican states.</p> <p>That is what Dean changed. He implemented his now-famous \"50-state strategy\". Hiring party organisers in every state, even ruby-red Oklahoma and Alabama. Paying them actual salaries, even. Spending money not just to win the election but to build a national infrastructure that could bear fruit into the next generation, or two. Does it seem obvious? Well, no one thought of it before. </p> <p>Three years on, Dean feels justified - for now. Asked whether his strategy will receive the ultimate vindication of electing a president, he said: \"I think it remains to be seen. But so far I feel my approach has been the right one. We have a congressional majority in some large proportions in the House, and I think we're going to certainly gain in the Senate. And where we're going to gain in the Senate is places like Virginia and Alaska and Colorado and New Mexico [all states that voted for Bush in 2004]. That's essentially expanding the playing field, which is what this is all about.\"</p> <p>He has made important converts. \"As many people know, Governor Dean was not my first choice to become head of the DNC, nor was he necessarily my second choice,\" said Harry Reid. \"But the success of his 50-state strategy has made a big believer out of me.\" Brendan Daly, a spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, said: \"The 50-state strategy has helped bring more people into the process. Democrats from Barack Obama to House candidates across the country are competing in even bright red states. This will be a great Democratic year.\"</p> <p>Not everyone is a believer. There is a certain family, rather prominent in Democratic politics, that is known never to have liked Dean. The female head of that household has millions of passionate followers, and many of them think Howard Dean rigged the primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. They point especially to hotly disputed votes from Florida and Michigan, states Clinton won but which saw their vote allocation cut in half by an official party committee ecause they violated party rules about when to hold their primaries. </p> <p>The charge doesn't hold water - party chairmen used to dictate outcomes like that in the era of the smoke-filled room, but those days are gone. Still, some Clintonistas thumb their collective nose at pleas for unity, calling themselves PUMAs (party unity, my ass), and 18-25% of them, according to polls, say they're voting for John McCain.</p> <p>Dean insists he has worked assiduously to appease them. \"I truly believe that we are much more unified than the media is writing about because of their tendency to focus on the nail that sticks up rather than what's really going on,\" he said.</p> <p>One very important Clinton backer sounded only partially pacified. Alan Patricof, one of Clinton's most prominent finance staff, said Dean \"has tried very hard to keep things smooth\". But he added: \"A different person with closer relationships with some people might have been able to push people around. Howard wasn't able to push people around.\"</p> <p>Dean says, \"I'm a huge fan of Hillary's and always have been.\" Whether the feeling is mutual is at the very least open to question. But if Barack Obama is elected president, what will it matter?</p> <p>As Dean knows, for all his successes at the state and local levels, a party chairman's legacy comes down to one question: did the party elect a president on his watch? Dean remains confident about Obama's chances, and he likes the way the nominee has embraced the Dean strategy of expanding the map, fighting for votes in states such as Indiana and North Carolina, where Democrats haven't even tried for years. Dean sees his legacy as being about both Obama and that expansion.</p> <p>\"I'm not the one to judge myself,\" he said. \"My own view is this party desperately needed to be shaken up and turned around. And we've done that. I believe we're going to win the presidency. But I don't think we're going to go back to the old days of trying to eke out a victory by six electoral votes and focus on just 20 states. I don't think we're going to go back to that model anymore.\"</p> <p>The fact that next week's convention is in Denver, a red state in what is sometimes called \"flyover country\", makes that clear. The party has changed. But now, the change needs to result in a win.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama yesterday kept up his guessing game with the American media as the frenzied speculation over his choice of running mate continued.</p> <p>Obama's deliberations over his choice of vice-president have dominated cable television news and blogs all week long, with commentators debating the merits of various politicians and the possible timing of an announcement.</p> <p>The consensus in the media is that Obama could appear with his choice of running mate today for a rally in Springfield, Illinois, where he launched his run for the White House in early 2007.</p> <p>John McCain, the Republican candidate, has also given no indication of his choice of running mate, but Obama is expected to make his announcement first because the Democrats are holding their convention ahead of the Republicans, in Denver next week.</p> <p>Excitement over Obama's choice of candidates reached fever pitch on Thursday after the Democrat told reporters he had made up his mind - but was not going to make an announcement. \"I won't comment on anything else until I introduce our running mate to the world,\" he said. \"That's all you're going to get out of me.\"</p> <p>The campaign has said it will make the announcement in text messages and emails to supporters.</p> <p>By yesterday, with the Democratic convention only 72 hours away, CNN was broadcasting from outside the homes of politicians reputed to be on Obama's shortlist, splitting the screen between the possibilities.</p> <p>In CNN's view, the top contenders for the second slot on the Democratic ticket include Joe Biden, the senator from Delaware who heads the foreign relations committee. But local media in Kansas were reporting that bumper stickers were already being printed declaring \"Obama-Bayh 08\", indicating a choice of Evan Bayh, a senator from Indiana with a reputation for fiscal conservatism. Other much discussed contenders include the Democratic governor of traditionally Republican Kansas, Kathleen Sebelius. Hillary Clinton is not thought to be in favour.</p> <p>But Obama's campaign has proved extraordinarily immune to leaks - a factor which has helped fuel the speculation.</p> <p>For McCain, the favoured running mate yesterday was said to be his former rival, Mitt Romney. However, there were also reports that he was considering General David Petraeus, the outgoing commander of US forces in Iraq.</p> <p>Obama has told reporters he wanted a sparring partner, rather than someone who would automatically second his ideas. \"I want somebody who's independent, somebody who can push against my preconceived notions and challenge me so we have got a robust debate in the White House,\" he said.</p>",

Asked whether his strategy will receive the ultimate vindication of electing a president, he said: \"I think it remains to be seen. But so far I feel my approach has been the right one. We have a congressional majority in some large proportions in the House, and I think we're going to certainly gain in the Senate. And where we're going to gain in the Senate is places like Virginia and Alaska and Colorado and New Mexico [all states that voted for Bush in 2004]. That's essentially expanding the playing field, which is what this is all about.\"</p> <p>He has made important converts. \"As many people know, Governor Dean was not my first choice to become head of the DNC, nor was he necessarily my second choice,\" said Harry Reid. </p> <p>\"But the success of his 50-state strategy has made a big believer out of me.\" </p> <p>Brendan Daly, a spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, said: \"The 50-state strategy has helped bring more people into the process. Democrats from Barack Obama to House candidates across the country are competing in even bright red states. This will be a great Democratic year.\"</p> <p>Not everyone is a believer. There is a certain family, rather prominent in Democratic politics, that is known never to have liked Dean. </p> <p>The female head of that household has millions of passionate followers, and many of them think Howard Dean rigged the primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. They point especially to hotly disputed votes from Florida and Michigan, states Clinton won but which saw their vote allocation cut in half by an official party committee because they violated party rules about when to hold their primaries.</p> <p>The charge doesn't hold water - party chairmen used to dictate outcomes like that in the era of the smoke-filled room, but those days are gone. Still, some Clintonistas thumb their collective nose at pleas for unity, calling themselves Pumas (party unity, my ass), and 18-25% of them, according to polls, say they're voting for John McCain.</p> <p>Dean insists he has worked assiduously to appease them. \"I truly believe that we are much more unified than the media is writing about because of their tendency to focus on the nail that sticks up rather than what's really going on,\" he said.</p> <p>One very important Clinton backer sounded only partially pacified. Alan Patricof, one of Clinton's most prominent finance staff, said Dean \"has tried very hard to keep things smooth\". But he added: \"A different person with closer relationships with some people might have been able to push people around. Howard wasn't able to push people around.\"</p> <p>Dean says, \"I'm a huge fan of Hillary's and always have been.\" Whether the feeling is mutual is at the very least open to question. But if Barack Obama is elected president, what will it matter?</p> <p>As Dean knows, for all his successes at the state and local levels, a party chairman's legacy comes down to one question: did the party elect a president on his watch? Dean remains confident about Obama's chances, and he likes the way the nominee has embraced the Dean strategy of expanding the map, fighting for votes in states such as Indiana and North Carolina, where Democrats haven't even tried for years. Dean sees his legacy as being about both Obama and that expansion.</p> <p>\"I'm not the one to judge myself,\" he said. \"My own view is this party desperately needed to be shaken up and turned around. And we've done that. I believe we're going to win the presidency. But I don't think we're going to go back to the old days of trying to eke out a victory by six electoral votes and focus on just 20 states. I don't think we're going to go back to that model anymore.\"</p> <p>The fact that next week's convention is in Denver, a red state in what is sometimes called \"flyover country\", makes that clear. The party has changed. But now, the change needs to result in a win.</p>",
  "<p>The leftist winds of change blowing strongly through South America in the 21st century arrived this month in Paraguay, where the latest member of the extraordinary coalition assembled over the past 10 years by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela assumed office in Asunci\u00f3n. <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/latinamerica/la-fg-leftists17-2008aug17,0,7472318.story\">President Fernando Lugo</a>, a former radical bishop well-versed in liberation theology, who won an election in April with the support of a hastily-assembled <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/15/4\">Alliance for Change</a>, is the new hope of the left, joining Ch\u00e1vez, Evo Morales of Bolivia, and <a href=\" http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKN1917845720080819\"> President Rafael Correa</a> of Ecuador in a fresh alliance of political leaders putting social and economic reform at the top of the agenda. Lugo's victory marked a significant moment in the history of Paraguay, defeating a corrupt and exhausted <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7357874.stm\">Colorado party</a> that had ruled the country for more than six decades, most of the time under the leadership of a military dictator. </p> <p>On the morning after his inauguration, Lugo travelled with Ch\u00e1vez to the northern town of San Pedro where he was once the bishop, and received from the hands of the Venezuelan president a replica of the sword of <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%B3n_Bol%C3%ADvar\"> Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar</a>, a symbolic act that welcomed the new recruit into the radical band of \"Bol\u00edvarian\" brothers that Ch\u00e1vez has created. Ch\u00e1vez's ambitions had been confined heretofore to the Andean countries once liberated by Bol\u00edvar from Spanish rule at the beginning of the 19th century, but this new friendship with Paraguay is a historical first. In his southward march from Venezuela, Bol\u00edvar never got beyond Bolivia, and indeed was a sworn enemy of Paraguay's founding father, the ascetic lawyer Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia.</p> <p>After a week in office, Lugo has left no one in any doubt where he stands. Like Correa in Ecuador, he sees no further use for the tutelage of the International Monetary Fund, preferring the advice of the US economist <a href=\"http://www.whirledbank.org/ourwords/stiglitz.html \">Joseph Stiglitz</a> who has suggested that a 10% tax on beef and soya exports would do wonders for the country's low tax base. The wealthy landowners would complain, as they have done in neighbouring Argentina, but they are unlikely to risk alienating Lugo's support among the rural poor so early in his presidency.</p> <p>Another bastion of the old conservative order is the legal system, where root and branch reform is expected imminently. Lugo has already begun clearing the decks with the <a href=\" http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iBRlghOMK6pEbIMAvdymMZXCK-SgD92MP9180\">military</a> and the police, traditionally the arbiters of Paraguay's political affairs. He has put a definitive end to the \"period of transition\" that has constrained the country's democratic practice since the downfall of <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfredo_Stroessner\"> General Alfredo Stroessner</a>, nearly 20 years ago in 1989, and brought in an entirely fresh high command.</p> <p>A purge of the diplomatic service will follow, with the removal of an entire generation of ambassadorial placemen. The appointment as foreign minister of Alejandro Hamed, a leftist historian who has been the ambassador in Beirut, has already alarmed Israel and the United States. The Israelis have a supporter in the vice-president, Federico Franco of the Liberal party, but Franco does not form part of Lugo's inner group of political advisers. This is a matter of some irritation to Franco, since Lugo's electoral victory was won in part with the support of the powerful Liberal machine. </p> <p>In his inaugural speech, Lugo called for an unusual combination of austerity and happiness. He had already renounced his presidential salary, and he called upon young people to embark on the task of reconstructing the country with a smile. He invoked the great political leaders of Paraguay in the 19th century like Francia and the L\u00f3pez family, but, in the presence of President Michelle Bachelet of Chile, whose father was a member of the government of Salvador Allende, he quoted Allende's last words on the morning of his overthrow in September 1973. Allende had famously expressed the hope that \"much sooner than later the great avenues will re-open along which free men will pass to build a better society\". Lugo echoed these words with the thought that the avenues would be \"covered not with asphalt but with the dreams of the founders of the Patria Grande (the great fatherland of Latin America)\".</p> <p>Lugo also invoked the writers and poets of the 20th century. These of course included <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Roa_Bastos\">Augusto Roa Bastos</a>, the country's most famous novelist; <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvio_Romero\">Elvio Romero</a>, a popular communist poet who died in exile in Buenos Aires, and <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Barrett\">Rafael Barrett</a>, an Anglo-Spanish journalist who made Paraguay his home and wrote from an anarchist perspective about its social life and the conditions of slavery that existed in the countryside. (Typically, the British government has closed its embassy in Asunci\u00f3n and could only afford to send its ambassador in Argentina to Lugo's inauguration. Spain sent their crown prince.)</p> <p>Lugo has received the almost unprecedented support of the Latin American media, perhaps because he is seen to deserve the respect accorded to a former bishop and perhaps too because it is hoped that he will prove more moderate than seems likely to be the case. \"This is a victory for the Latin American revolution,\" said Ch\u00e1vez in Asunci\u00f3n, but Ecuador's <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/international-politics/2008/08/president-lugo-paraguay\"> Correa </a> warned that Lugo's international reception might not be so delirious once his reforms begin to bite.</p>",
  "<p>Next Tuesday's by-election in Penang in the constituency of Permatang Pauh will determine the future of Malaysian politics. Voters in the largely semi-rural constituency will decide whether to return their controversial favourite son, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_Ibrahim\">Anwar Ibrahim</a>, to parliament. The former deputy prime minister was beaten and jailed in 1998 on charges of corruption and sodomy.</p> <p>He served six years, and subsequently the sodomy charges were dismissed. He now leads an opposition coalition, the People's Alliance, comprised of three disparate political parties - his own People's Justice party, the Islamic party PAS and the secular, largely Chinese-based Democratic Action party \u2013 which won a record number of parliamentary seats and five of the state governments in the March 2008 polls.</p> <p>This alliance has set its sights on removing the incumbent National Front coalition, which has governed the country since independence in 1957, from office. In order to do so, they need to have their prime minister back in the seat that he first won in 1982.</p> <p>The stakes are high. For the opposition, the People's Alliance depends heavily on Anwar's leadership to hold it together and make it nationally viable for voters. Anwar is a moderate Muslim who appeals across the ethnic groups in Malaysia and comes from the majority Malay community that holds political power. They need his charismatic leadership to break the stranglehold the National Front holds on power.</p> <p>Although there is considerable unease among some Malaysians about the agendas of different components in the alliance, Anwar's coalition promises reform and offers Malaysians the hope of greater ethnic inclusion and cleaner government. </p> <p>It is this very threat of exposing the years of corruption that is shaking the National Front to its core. The incumbent coalition is led by Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi, who was appointed to lead the dominant party in the Front in 2003 by Malaysia's longest serving leader, Dr Mahathir. Abdullah has been a major disappointment. He squandered his mandate for change in 2004 and has not delivered on any of the institutional reforms the country desperately needs.</p> <p>His indecisive leadership style and lack of vision underscore the country's lack of direction, as it is losing competitiveness and foreign investment. During his almost five years in office, he has spent more public funds than his predecessor, and unlike his predecessor failed to deliver any substantial results. Inequality has widened, inflation has reached record levels and race relations have worsened, particularly over the issue of religious freedom. It is thus no surprise that the National Front was thrashed in the last polls and will likely lose the Penang by-election. The National Front aims to reduce Anwar's majority and discredit his bid for national power.</p> <p>The Front is doing everything it can to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/03/malaysia\">prevent Anwar from winning</a>. In July, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/07/malaysia.religion?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=worldnews\">new charges for sodomy were filed</a> in a case that has serious flaws. On the eve of the election campaign, the alleged sodomy whistleblower swore on the Qur'an in an effort to challenge Anwar's credibility. Personal attacks on Anwar have run the gamut from a Chinese government agent to the betrayer of the Malay community.</p> <p>The ruthless tactics adopted include the use of government machinery and media. This week the National Front selectively targeted elected representatives from Anwar's party in a <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/08/20/asia/AS-Malaysia-Anwar.php\">questionable roundup by the anti-corruption agency</a>. Each day, the government-linked newspapers portray Anwar as the most serious national threat.</p> <p>The attacks have had an impact, and fostered doubt among some Malaysians about Anwar's ability to govern. Concerns centre on credibility and character. Others have concerns that Anwar is moving too fast and confrontationally. They are worried his rhetoric to take over government nationally will bring a defensive, authoritarian response from the incumbent government and that his young coalition lacks the experience to address the growing national problems exacerbated by Abdullah's mismanagement.</p> <p>Authoritarianism is on the rise in Malaysia. In the last few months the government has deepened its crackdown on blogs and banned a forum sponsored by the Malaysian Bar Council from discussing religious rights \u2013 all in the name of \"stability\". At the same time the government has embraced exclusionary racial messages that argue for Malay supremacy over the other races in a dangerous move to bring the Malays back into the Front's fold. </p> <p>In this political war between Anwar and the Front, Malaysian society is increasingly polarised and alienated by the dirty campaign tactics. Yet, as the campaign evolves, more mud is likely to be piled on, crowding out the critical issues of inclusion, accountability and policy. Ironically, in light of the focus on the personal, this high-stakes election will ultimately boil down to how the 59,000 voters \u2013 largely Malay \u2013 in Permatang Pauh perceive Anwar Ibrahim, the man rather than his message.</p>",
  "<p>Ben Smith <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0808/Obama_Out_of_Touch.html?showall\">has the latest</a> in the Obama team's out-of-touch sweepstakes, titled, uh, \"Out of Touch.\"</p> <p>You will see that it shows McCain riding around in a golf cart with Poppy Bush from a few weeks ago -- an image that one knew was destined for an Obama commercial the instant one saw it. I suspect the old man Bush is still reasonably popular, but he certainly does reek of the country club, so I guess this probably passes muster. And the phrase \"Country Club Economics,\" which one hears early on in the ad, is very good, I think.</p> <p>I would however like to say a word in behalf of golf carts. Having taken up the old game not long ago, I can attest that they're very handy things and as readily available at the el-cheapo public courses I play as they are at Augusta National. In fact, I'd bet that at Augusta and stuffy places like that, players are urged to walk the course with the caddies that are provided them. </p> <p>The thing about the golf cart in this ad, which few people will probably bother to stop and think about, is that these images don't come from a country club but from a visit McCain made to Bush Sr's compound in Maine. So, syllogistically, it stands to reason that Bush drives the cart around his property. For an octogenarian that actually makes sense, I think. But let's keep that part to ourselves.</p>",
  "<p>More4 is aiming to be \"the place to go\" for television coverage of this autumn's US presidential election, incoming controller <strong>Hamish Mykura</strong> revealed at the <a href=\"http://www.mgeitf.co.uk/home/mgeitf.aspx\">MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival</a> today.</p> <p>Mykura, who formally takes the reins of the channel when current incumbent Peter Dale steps down next week, told delegates that his channel will \"pack\" his schedule with programmes themed around US politics to mark this November's election.</p> <p>\"More 4 will be the place to go with the US elections,\" he said of the event, which he said promises to be \"one of the best elections in living memory\".</p> <p>More 4's line-up includes the only UK broadcast of the debates between the candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain, and the transmission of the lavish HBO seven-part drama series <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/films/johnadams/\">John Adams</a> about the US founding father and the country's second president.</p> <p>More 4 will also show HBO's film Recount, a dramatisation of the controversial \"hanging chads\" furore during the 2000 election that saw George W Bush come to power, starring Kevin Spacey and John Hurt, Mykura added.</p> <p>Other programming adding to More4's US election season include the The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and a reshowing of Death of a President, the controversial film the channel showed in 2006 imagining the assassination of Bush. \"It will be our fond farewell to George Bush,\" Mykura quipped.</p> <p>Mykura also refuted suggestions that his channel would suffer due to budget cuts. More4's budget is understood to have fallen by about a third since the channel's launch in 2004, from about \u00a330m to \u00a320m. In June Dale cited his \"frustration\" with cuts as the reason for tendering his resignation.</p> <p>\"The consensus seems to be that budgets are down but when I look into the coffers I think that money is there,\" said Mykura.</p> <p>Mykura also refuted claims that his channel would be abandoning original drama commissions altogether as a means of making savings.</p> <p>\"It would be a mistake to say that the door is closed on big one-off dramas on More4. It isn't. I certainly hope to do one a year, I might even be able to do more than that.\"</p> <p>He added that his channel would be showing a televised version of the acclaimed stage production of King Lear starring Sir Ian McKellen and directed by Trevor Nunn.</p> <p>Mykura went on to insist that one aim of his channel was to act as a \"counterblast\" to the \"comfortable view of our recent past\" taken by BBC4, with programmes such as its \"curse of comedy drama season\" about classic British comedians and the drama The Long Walk to Finchley about Mrs Thatcher's early years.</p> <p>Speaking at the same session, E4 controller <strong>Angela Jain</strong> compared her channel to BBC3 with the comment: \"I don't have to make any shows that have any worthy intent whatsoever, I just have to make shows that are fun.\"</p> <p>She also admitted that he channel had a \"tough\" year ahead, but added: \"We have to be ruthless when we commission things but that is not necessarily a bad thing...a good idea will always win in the end.\"</p>",
  "<p>Political scientists Stephen Brown, Chandra Lekha Sriram and Marie-Jo\u00eblle Zahar are right in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/20/zimbabwe\">pointing out</a> the perils of a quick-fix power-sharing solution in Zimbabwe.</p> <p>They view a unity government as an untidy and \"inherently undemocratic\" outcome but they are less successful in outlining possible alternatives for ending the political deadlock in Harare. Their suggestion that Zimbabwe should hold fresh elections under a caretaker government is fanciful at best because Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF party is unlikely to agree to a new poll.</p> <p>In any case it is difficult to see how a credible election can be held in the toxic environment that Mugabe and his shock troops have created in Zimbabwe today. Given Zimbabwe's weak institutions and partisan security forces, fresh elections would do very little to deepen the democratic culture.</p> <p>The international community has been urging the main opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, and his MDC party to push for \"full executive authority\". Although this is desirable, Mugabe and Zanu-PF are unlikely to cede complete control - therefore Tsvangirai needs to take a more realistic approach.</p> <p>Rather than quibbling over what amount of power he will exercise in a new coalition government, the opposition leader might be wiser to demand a framework for genuine reforms under a unity government.</p> <p>Constitutional changes that would shield the judiciary from executive interference and change the current system where judges are handpicked by a compliant Judicial Service Commission, for example, would offer a significant check on the all-powerful presidency. An independent judiciary could be a powerful guarantor of Zimbabwe's democracy down the road while serving as a deterrent to the militias that have wreaked havoc in the country, safe in the knowledge that there would be no consequences for their actions.</p> <p>Similar changes to guarantee the independence of the electoral commission and strip the presidency of powers to appoint its members would be an invaluable tool in safeguarding the integrity of future elections.</p> <p>The impact of genuine reforms would be to insulate Zimbabwe against a reversion to one-man rule, entrench the concept of separation of powers between various arms of government and possibly offer a window for cleaning up the security forces. This would be a far better platform for sustainable change in Zimbabwe than fresh elections in the current poisoned environment.</p> <p>Tsvangirai and the MDC have time on their side, mainly because of coming changes in South Africa where ANC leader Jacob Zuma is expected to replace Thabo Mbeki as president in a year's time. This transition will be uncomfortable for Mugabe and Zanu-PF. The Zimbabwean leader has profited from his close ties to Mbeki with whom, as Mbeki's biographer William Gumede <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/africa/2008/06/tsvangirai-mugabe-zimbabwe\">has noted</a>, he shares a kinship rooted in class and history.</p> <p>Mbeki and Mugabe are both well educated and were involved in the liberation struggle. Tsvangirai, by contrast, is a former trade unionist of modest education who did not take part in the guerrilla movement that helped to end white minority rule, a fact that informs Mbeki and Mugabe's dim view of his suitability to lead.</p> <p>The rise of Zuma - like Tsvangirai a man who has been propelled to his position by the powerful trade unions in South Africa - is likely to change all that. Zuma and other powerful figures within the ANC initially regarded Mugabe with sympathy as he cast himself as a champion resisting neo-colonialism and as a victim of imperial conspiracy. As Mugabe has increasingly turned his guns on his own people in his attempts to cling to power that admiration has given way to revulsion. Where Cosatu, the umbrella body of South African trade unions, was once a keen supporter of Mugabe, its members are now more likely to be found leading demonstrations against him. Zuma has also been far more strident in his <a href=\"http://www.zimdaily.com/news/zuma22.4911.html\">public criticisms</a> of Mugabe than Mbeki, a fact which does not portend well for the Zanu-PF leaders.</p> <p>Considering the leverage that South Africa has over Zimbabwe's leadership, it is inconceivable that under a Zuma presidency Mugabe would be able to get away with the virtual impunity he has exercised under Mbeki's watch.</p> <p>If, on the other hand, Tsvangirai refuses to take part in a unity government, his stance could give Zanu-PF an opportunity to go ahead with a unilateral arrangement that excludes the main opposition leader and present this to the rest of Africa as a <em>fait accompli</em> borne of the opposition's intransigence.</p> <p>A lot of commentators have drawn parallels between the deal Mugabe wants to strike with Tsvangirai and the 1987 <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7558578.stm\">unity government</a> with another former trade unionist, Joshua Nkomo. That arrangement ended unhappily for Nkomo whose Zapu party was overshadowed by Zanu and whose career never recovered.</p> <p>But Mugabe may be looking further back into history as he discusses a new coalition government. The state media in the last few weeks have been &lt; a href=\"http://www.herald.co.zw/inside.aspx?sectid=817&amp;cat=1\"&gt;actively supporting a deal that would see Mugabe enter a coalition with the smaller MDC faction led by Arthur Mutambara. Zanu-PF would then attempt to poach opposition MPs with offers of front bench positions to maintain control of parliament. With the Zimbabwean national assembly convening on Tuesday, the next few weeks could yield movements in this direction.</p> <p>Such an arrangement would have echoes of the deal struck between Bishop Abel Muzorewa and the Ian Smith regime in 1979. Smith hoped to freeze out what he viewed as the more radical liberation movement players such as Mugabe and Nkomo by working with Muzorewa. It was a desperate attempt to hold on to power and it did not ultimately succeed. Mugabe's attempt will similarly fail in the long run, though in the short term it will keep him in power while deepening the economic crisis in Zimbabwe.</p> <p>The MDC has few real options outside some form of unity government, but it must insist on enough guarantees to ensure a process of reform with an eye to the Mugabe succession.</p> <p>If nothing else, this arrangement will help to pave the way for badly-needed investment to help lift the economic siege that has enveloped Zimbabwe under Zanu-PF rule. Unlike the politicians, the suffering masses do not have time on their side.</p>",
  "<p>In another one of those gotcha moments in this presidential campaign of never-ending gotcha moments, John McCain's bullies, er, surrogates, are <a href=\"http://www.nysun.com/national/obama-adviser-offers-some-advice-to-damascus/84260/\">going after one of Barack Obama's Middle East advisers</a> because he - get this - attended a conference hosted by the American Bar Association in Syria. </p> <p>During the visit he - again, get this - encouraged the Syrian foreign minister to advance the Israel-Syria peace negotiations, a policy publicly embraced by Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert. Omigod, where does Dan Kurtzer get the unmitigated chutzpah to agree with the stated policy of an Israeli government? Call out the dogs, something must be done, off with his head!</p> <p>The McCainites even had the audacity to accuse Kurtzer of pursuing his own negotiations with Syria, suggesting in a conference call, according to the JTA , that <a href=\"http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/110025.html\">Kurtzer was engaged in covert negotiations</a> with Syria.</p> <p>What else irks McCain and other neocons? The conference was organised in part by the <a href=\"http://www.britishsyriansociety.org/\">British Syrian Society</a>, whose founder is Bashir Assad's father-in-law. Also, the funding for the conference came in part from Syrian corporations and a Canadian oil company. This of course means both Kurtzer and Obama are in the pocket of the Syrians:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Foundation for the Defence of Democracies' Tony Badran said the conference Mr Kurtzer attended in Damascus was part of a Syrian campaign to build up good will with the west. ... \"It's not a secret that the Syrians are openly banking on Barack Obama. It's not surprising that they would build bridges in advance and do this through the window of the peace process.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Getting lost in the hue and cry is the subject of the conference Kurtzer attended, which was strengthening the rule of law in Syrian society. I guess McCain doesn't much care for it.</p> <p>Michael Goldfarb, McCain's deputy communications director, got off a medium-quality zinger about the trip: \"If one of senator Obama's advisers has been to Damascus, we just wonder how many have been to Tehran.\"</p> <p>Heaven forbid that the McCain campaign should understand that Syria and Iran are quite different countries with much different sets of interests and that Syria, unlike Iran, has actually shown great interest in breaking out of its alliance with Iran and joining the west. And God forbid that Obama should send representatives to meet the Iranians. Imagine what could happen? Peace might break out and then where would the neocon agenda be? They lost the Evil Empire in 1989. They lost Saddam. Now they have Iran. It reminds me of the old saying: \"If there was no God, humans would have to invent Him.\" What will they do when they don't have Iran to demonise?</p> <p>JTA nicely pointed out that each of the McCain attack dogs who excoriated Kurtzer - Rudy Giuliani and Randy Scheunemann - aren't exactly choir boys when it comes to being bought and paid for lobbyists for shabby foreign governments:</p> <blockquote> <p>They said this did not compare to Giuliani's law firm's past representation of Citgo, the Venezuela-owned oil refiner, and of the Saudi oil ministry, nor with Scheunemann's past lobbying for Georgia. Scheunemann said his lobbying and Giuliani's lawyering were all part of the public record, although Giuliani's clients were uncovered by the Associated Press last year after his own presidential campaign declined disclosure requests.</p> <p>\"It is no secret, in fact it's known openly that I worked for the Georgians,\" Scheunemann said. \"It was a secret until this story broke that Ambassador Kurtzer before he accompanied senator Obama on his Middle East trip was in Syria talking to senior Syrian officials.\" It's not clear that Kurtzer made any effort to hide the visit. </p> <p>The Obama campaign accused the McCain campaign of hypocrisy. \"Senator McCain's top aide, Charlie Black, was paid to lobby on behalf of dictators guilty of terrible human rights abuses, and the McCain campaign throws a fit about an unpaid adviser encouraging progress in the ongoing Israeli-Syrian peace talks during his free time?\" Tommy Vietor, an Obama spokesman, said in an email message. He was referring to Black's past lobbying for Angolan, Somali, Zairean and other figures.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is one of those bizarre moments in a presidential campaign. A candidate's representative actually makes a small, quiet, well-meaning gesture to advance the cause of peace. And all hell breaks loose. What does McCain want? One hundred years of hatred between the US and Syria (like the 100 years of war in Iraq he's prepared to accept)? A perpetual alliance between Iran and Syria against Israel? Lebanon eternally torn asunder by warring sects? Is that what his policy would be?</p> <p>Given that Scheunemann was one of the original neocon proponents of overthrowing Saddam and that Giuliani campaign adviser Norman Podhoretz advocated nuking Iran, my guess is that they and McCain would be quite satisfied with the US on a perpetual war footing against some enemy or another. Call it winning and governing by fear. Bush has perfected the art, though he's been faltering lately, and fewer Americans seem to be buying it. Which is why this McCain gotcha moment will, with any luck, have the shelf life of a piece of day-old bread. But you just never know. This campaign is just crazy enough that this matter could resonate with some voters.</p> <p>The McCain campaign is practicing a particularly lame form of wedge politics to pander to pro-Israel Jewish voters. But perhaps someone should tell McCain that a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/25/israelandthepalestinians.usforeignpolicy\">J Street poll</a> reveals that 58% of American Jews favour a deal between Israel and Syria that involves giving up the Golan in return for full peace with Syria - precisely the purpose of the peace talks Kurtzer was attempting to advance. I guess McCain believes he'll score a few points with the 42% who don't favour such a deal between Israel and Syria. That's an awfully small wedge if you ask me.</p>",
  "<p>As the country <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/08/bayhs-drive-by.html\">holds its breath</a> and waits for Barack Obama's vice-presidential choice to emerge, it's worth taking a look at the running mate John McCain is <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/politico/20080819/pl_politico/12619\\\">planning to introduce</a> a week from today.</p> <p>A major aspect of McCain's appeal to independent voters -- the types political analysts call \"swing\" voters -- is his stated commitment to fighting climate change. No less an arbiter than <a href=\"http://gulliverswift.newsvine.com/_news/2008/08/19/1763043-nyt-bill-clinton-praises-john-mccains-energy-policy\">Bill Clinton recently said</a> that no matter who is elected president this year, reducing carbon emissions will vault to the top of the agenda.</p> <p>But McCain may send a very mixed message next week by choosing a vice-president who is, shall we say, less than convinced about the merits of mandatory greenhouse gas reduction. Where do his hopefuls stand on the issue?...</p> <p><strong>Mitt Romney:</strong> He has become the front-runner in the VP speculation game, but just seven months ago Romney was slamming <a href=\"http://www.pewclimate.org/policy_center/analyses/s_139_summary.cfm\">McCain's climate change bill</a> as a \"<a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/DEC_2008\">job killer</a>\" that would \"make it harder for families to make their ends meet\". The former Massachusetts governor was also <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAGpLOKtQDA\">filmed earlier this year</a> saying a cap-and-trade carbon reduction scheme is \"one of the possible solutions\" but that he would only pursue it \"with other nations involved\".</p> <p><strong>Tim Pawlenty:</strong> This Minnesota governor, reportedly high on McCain's short list, is one potential running mate who might keep the Republican honest on climate change. He established a <a href=\"http://www.governor.state.mn.us/mediacenter/pressreleases/PROD008606.html\">regional cap-and-trade system</a> with fellow mid-westerners this year and backs state carbon reduction targets that are even steeper than McCain has proposed for the entire US. But <a href=\"http://www.minnpost.com/ronway/2008/02/21/958/critics_wonder_what_happened_to_pawlentys_push_to_reduce_emissions\">critics have grumbled</a> about Pawlenty's slow follow-through on the recommendations of his own climate change advisers.</p> <p><strong>Joe Lieberman:</strong> This dark-horse choice for McCain's No 2 was his co-sponsor on a major climate change reduction bill in 2005, making him a natural ally on the issue.</p> <p><strong>Tom Ridge:</strong> He is another long-shot candidate thanks to his support for abortion rights, but this former homeland security secretary has revealed little in recent years about his stance on climate change. In 2000, while governor of Pennsylvania, he <a href=\"http://ontheissues.org/Governor/Tom_Ridge_Energy_+_Oil.htm\">signed onto a platform</a> that called for \"voluntary\", not mandatory, carbon reductions and insisted on a global climate change treaty would only work if every country agreed to reductions.</p>",
  "<p>Interesting graf buried in today's LA Times <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-na-campaign22-2008aug22,0,1254408.story\">piece </a>on house-gate:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>McCain, who huddled with advisors at his desert compound in Sedona, Ariz., said nothing in public. A nine-car motorcade took him to a nearby Starbucks early in the morning, where he ordered a large cappuccino. McCain otherwise avoided reporters.</p> </blockquote> <p>Nine cars? Gee. It sounds like he's...<em>already trying to act presidential!</em> This was a huge no-no three weeks ago when Obama was supposedly doing it. </p> <p>This is not a massive political issue, but it <em>is </em>deeply baffling. Why in the world are nine vehicles needed to procure a cappuccino? What could possibly be in all those cars?</p> <p>I learned a little something about this following Hillary around upstate New York in 2000. But to the best of my memory, she (the alleged self-regarding ice queen etc etc) had a three-car entourage. Her van (dubbed HRC Speedwagon), and two cars of Secret Service people, one mostly laden (we assumed and guessed) with firearms, the other with human agents. It may have been four. But it sure wasn't <em>nine.</em> </p>",
  "<p>My old friend Mark from Brooklyn recently visited family in Ohio and reports in:</p> <blockquote> <p>I had mixed feelings on my trip to my rural roots in Ohio last week. Especially among the older crowd race is certainly going to be a factor, and we all know the older folks tend to vote in large numbers. On the other hand, a women a year older than I, whom I have known since childhood, a pretty solid Republican who castigated me in 2000 when she found out I was going to vote for Hillary for Senate, is a very enthusiastic Obama supporter! This is definitely a very complicated race.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yep, it sure is. The larger point here is the shifting nature of both candidates' coalitions, but in particular Obama's, and what those shifts may mean for both parties' futures. </p> <p>For now, we're seeing some settling into normal patterns for both candidates, according to polls. Republicans are rallying to McCain and Obama is in good shape in his party with the important asterisk of the Hillary faithful, a significant percentage of whom still need to be brought around. Most people assume that most of them will.</p> <p>But even if that happens, I'd expect other things will happen to upset the normal patterns. We have two candidate who pride themselves to different degrees on being post-partisan. Each will draw into the other's expected pool of voters. McCain may well get more older voters than a Republican usually does, while Obama should snag more votes from middle-aged independents and moderate Republicans. To me, this is one of the fascinating stories of this election, but it's really uncoverable in journalistic terms until November 5, when we see what actually happened.</p>",

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336882337\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Russia began its long-awaited withdrawal from the central Georgian city of Gori today, with a dusty mile-long column of tanks and armoured vehicles pulling out of their forward positions and heading north back to their own territory.</p> <p>Witnesses said Russian forces began pulling out of the city at midday local time, nine days after sweeping into Gori and blockading the main highway connecting the east and west of the country. </p> <p>The withdrawal follows a series of delays and mixed signals from the Kremlin about when and if it intended to leave Georgia. There has been intense pressure from the US, EU and other countries for an immediate pullout.</p> <p>The Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, who signed a ceasefire deal last weekend, promised the withdrawal would start today. Russian troops abandoned their checkpoint 27 miles outside Tbilisi this afternoon.</p> <p>\"We're going home. Our mood is marvellous, beautiful. We came here, experienced war, and are all going back in one piece,\" Osman, a 23-year-old Russian soldier from Dagestan, told the Guardian last night. \"The only shame is we didn't make it as far as Tbilisi. We wanted to go but our commander didn't give us the order.</p> <p>He added jokingly: \"We'd like to go to Britain next. We know that British people are very cultured and aristocratic. I would like to meet English girls.\" </p> <p>Other soldiers took souvenir photographs on their mobile phones.</p> <p>Tanks occupying the strategic hills overlooking the town of Igoeti pulled out this afternoon. A large column of vehicles, impossible to count, then began a bumper-to-bumper retreat. </p> <p>Georgian police in four-wheel drive vehicles followed and were camped not far from Gori, waiting to take over the town. By nightfall, Russian troops had still not retreated from the village of Nadarbazevi, about nine miles east of Gori and on the main Tbilisi highway.</p> <p>An armoured \"peacekeeping\" vehicle flying the Russian flag continued to block the road. It was not immediately clear how long the checkpoint would remain.</p> <p>Under the text of the ceasefire agreement brokered by the French president, Nicholas Sarkozy, Russian forces are obliged to withdraw to the \"line\" they occupied \"prior\" to Georgia's disastrous incursion into separatist South Ossetia on August 7-8.</p> <p>Russia has insisted that an earlier agreement allows it to station troops in a \"buffer security zone\" between Gori and South Ossetia's capital, Tskhinvali. Georgia and western diplomats say this is a clear breach of the ceasefire deal.</p> <p>Shota Utiashviavi, a spokesman for Georgia's interior ministry, welcomed Russia's apparent departure from Georgia but said Moscow's pullout was so far partial and did not include the west of the country.</p> <p>\"There's been no withdrawal from western Georgia. They are putting up checkpoints in (the port of) Poti. The ceasefire agreement clearly says that they don't have any right to block any major road or to be in major urban areas,\" he told the Guardian.</p> <p>He said there were doubts whether Russia would abide by the agreement and pull its troops out of Georgian villages north of Gori. Residents from the area fled last week, following attacks and killings by South Ossetian militias.</p> <p>Russia has suggested its new buffer zone could extend eight miles into territory previously controlled by the Georgian government. South Ossetian forces have occupied towns outside the original rebel-controlled enclave, but inside the former Soviet borders of South Ossetia.</p> <p>\"We have to see whether they leave the administrative borders of South Ossetia,\" Utiashviavi said, adding: \"The occupation continues.\"</p> <p>Many Georgians expressed joy at Russia's apparent pullout. \"It's beautiful. I feel a great weight has been lifted from my shoulders. I feel free,\" said Koba Chirodze, 41, from Vanni, near Gori.</p> <p>Asked why the Russians had bothered to invade Georgia, he said: \"There is a saying that you can't understand Russia, you just have to believe in it. I can't believe in Russia. And we can't really understand it either.\"</p> <p>Attention will now shift to Georgia's pro-western leader, Mikheil Saakashvili. His decision to attack South Ossetia is likely to be seen as a reckless gamble. Analysts say he may have fallen into a perfect trap set by Russian provocation.</p> <p>Georgia's opposition has until now backed the president during the country's greatest crisis since independence. But in the coming weeks it will almost certainly demand his removal. More than 125,000 people have been uprooted by the conflict - with their dissatisfaction certain to grow. In theory, Saakashvili will remain in office until 2013, following his re-election in January.</p> <p>Russia appeared to have achieved all of its major strategic goals - scuppering Georgia's attempts to join Nato, destroying its army and infrastructure, and humiliating Saakashvili. It has made it clear it is no longer prepared to accept a unipolar world in which the US calls the shots.</p>",
  "<p>Well, rather earlier than expected, the right wing has reintroduced Bill Ayers to the campaign, with<a href=\"http://www.oliverwillis.com/2008/08/21/american-issues-project-ayers-ad-is-mccain-campaign-in-drag/\"> this ad</a> linking Obama to the radical lefty/former US government overthrower. </p> <p>The ad isn't by the McCain team per se, but by something called the \"American Issues Project,\" which is spending $2.8 million airing it in Michigan and other key states. I can't tell whether it's effective. It just depends on what people are willing to believe about Obama. Maybe a lot. I remember when Hillary first ran for senate in 2000, the New York State GOP tried to tie her to al-Qaida, a then little-known tendency that had just bombed the USS Cole in middle eastern waters. </p> <p>Most people found that one a little much, and it backfired. But she'd been first lady for eight years and was far better known. Obama needs to know that a lot more like this is coming. This particular ad insanely overstates their relationship and of course tries to make it sound like Obama endorsed Ayers' activities when Obama was a little boy learning how to hit a baseball. At any rate, he'll need to turn these very attacks into a McCain negative. Tricky thing to do, but possible.</p>",

The way Obama carries on, you'd think he was born in Hawaii and was practically like the president or something. Yeesh.</p> <p>And I've heard he didn't even inherit his money, but earned it himself. How gauche.</p> <p>McCain, on the other hand, is a true patriot and a real American who loves to mingle with the hoi polloi every chance he's scheduled, came by his money the old-fashioned way and knows damn well how to spend it: On lots of houses. Maybe as many as 11, but let's call it four. That's the common touch.</p> <p>Man, I'd love to have a beer with that guy.</p>",
  "<p>The British government will lose its leadership position on climate change and risk scuppering a global deal to cut emissions if it presses ahead with a new generation of dirty coal power, say leading US scientists and environmental leaders.</p> <p>The heads of three influential groups, representing more than 2 million members, have written to the foreign secretary, David Miliband, warning that the UK proposals for up to eight new coal plants threatens the chance of the US joining a post-Kyoto international agreement to be agreed in 2009.</p> <p>It is the first public sign of growing international anger over the plans and will add to pressure on Miliband and the environment secretary, Hilary Benn, to oppose the government's new coal policy in cabinet. Most immediate is the decision on whether to approve the first major planning application for a new coal plant at Kingsnorth in Kent, the site of this month's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorthclimatecamp\">Climate Camp protest</a>.</p> <p>In the UK, there has already been heavy criticism of the plans to build new coal plants, without technology to capture and bury the large volumes of carbon dioxide emitted. Lord Smith, the new head of the government's Environment Agency, recently added forcefully to condemnations by the Environmental Audit Committee, the Royal Society, City investment groups, the government's environmental advisor Jonathon Porritt, former chief scientist Professor Sir David King, and the Institute for Public Policy Research think-tank. </p> <p>The letter, now revealed to the Guardian, is signed by the heads of the <a href=\" http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2008/08/15/Milibandletter.pdf\">Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Natural Resources Defense Council</a>. It argues Britain is in a particularly important position because of \"your government's historic commitment to lead on global warming in Europe and around the world.\"</p> <p>It adds: \"As proposed, these conventional coal plants lack any limits on their emissions of carbon dioxide and would drastically increase the UK's carbon dioxide emissions and make achievement of your stated pollution reduction goals extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible. Building new conventional plants and setting the UK up to fail and lose its leadership mantle will make our work in the US all the more difficult.\"</p> <p>Tim Jones, climate policy officer for the World Development Movement anti-poverty campaign group, said the concern was shared across the developing world, especially where emerging environment campaigns are arguing for much poorer nations to cut emissions, and rich countries like the UK are being blamed for changes such as typhoons, drought and rising sea levels. </p> <p>\"They can adapt to one to two degrees of warming, but if it's more than that they can't adapt; they are just filled with despair,\" said Jones.</p> <p>British officials and ministers are understood to have already been challenged over plans for unabated coal power by other governments.</p> <p>The US intervention - signed by Carl Pope, the Sierra Club's executive director, Kevin Knobloch, the UCS president, and Frances G Beinecke, the NRDC director \u2013 follows an unprecedented campaign against new coal power in the US which has led to 66 of a proposed 150 new plants being abandoned or rejected by politicians and the courts, and most of the remainder locked in legal battles.</p> <p>But although the two main candidates for the US presidential election in November, John McCain and Barack Obama, have both declared their support for international emissions cuts, campaigners warn that any deal would also have to be approved by Congress, which would need to know there was public support for such a move, particularly during a recession.</p> <p>'If the UK takes a firm stand and rejects conventional coal it will send a strong, clear message to our new President and a new Congress, as well as to other countries considering new coal plants,' the letter adds. </p> <p>Replying for the British government, the energy minister at DBERR, Malcolm Wicks, said \"as a 'live' planning case I cannot comment on the merits or otherwise\u2026or on the timing of any decision\". </p> <p>In a Guardian interview earlier this month, Wicks widened the government's argument in favour of coal, saying that new power stations were not just essential for energy security but also to allow the development of carbon capture and storage technology. Without that technology, \"all is lost on global warming\", he said, because of China's reliance on the fuel. \"The idea that if we showed some kind of lead and we in Britain say no to coal and China will say 'OK we will follow' is just daft,\" he said. Green campaigners reject the idea that CCS cannot be developed without new, unabated power stations.</p> <p>A recent report by the IPPR said the European Union's goal of reducing emissions from the power sector and heavy industry through its emissions trading scheme would collapse if the go-ahead were given to seven new coal plants in the UK and up to 75 across Europe.</p>",

  "<p>August is supposed to be about being out on long warm evenings, not sheltering from the rain. Undeterred, we carry on campaigning, while other brave souls are enjoying the all-weather pitches in Islington parks. Just down the road, Hackney has built a beach volleyball pitch in Shoreditch Park (Rio de Hoxton?). Sadly the climate's not playing ball. Who's in charge of the weather for 2012?</p> <p>Britain's Beijing medal haul is amazing. I'm always impressed with how normal so many of the Olympic athletes seem, compared to the instant celebs of our age, when their achievements are so extraordinary. For most of the 1990s, I worked at the Sports Council, and saw firsthand the transformation that lottery funding brought to British sport. Now we're seeing the results in the medal tables; it's the best part of <a href=\"http:/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/aug/19/inpoliticsifyouhang\">John Major's legacy</a>.</p> <p>But don't get nostalgic for the Tories. Getting on your bike today may mean medals: but Tebbit's \"on your bike\" was the worst of unfeeling Thatcherism. Unemployed workers were told to migrate by a Conservative government that didn't seem to understand or care that its policies had caused the destruction of whole communities. And now the Policy Exchange report <a href=\"http://\">Cities Unlimited</a> is on the same lines. Northern cities are dead, people are fleeing, and south-east England must accommodate these economic refugees. </p> <p>I should declare an interest. My mum's family moved to London from Manchester when she was a small child. So I know that migration is natural and can be good. But it has to be by choice. Trying to engineer mass migration - whether by socialist state planning or abandoning all to the free market - is inhuman. And policies that ignore the human element deserve to fail.</p> <p>While the world's eyes are on Beijing, my party conference agenda has arrived, full of the joys of Bournemouth - and a much better approach. Our policies are about bringing communities together, not breaking them up, with high-speed rail links between cities, and investment in sustainable housing within them. </p> <p>Sport's on the agenda too, with a ban on standing at football matches - a subject dear to Arsenal-loving Islington. The <a href=\"http://www.footballnetwork.org/dev/communityfootball/violence_taylor_report.asp\">Taylor report</a> was necessary and there's no way I'd support a return to open terraces. This motion's proposing a seat for each spectator to avoid dangerous overcrowding, but designated areas where fans can watch standing up. To quote proposer <a href=\"http://www.libdemvoice.org/conference-policy-motion-safe-standing-at-football-matches-3164.html\">Peter Jones</a>, it's about choice, freedom and responsibility. Policy Exchange, please take note. </p> <p><strong>Equitable Life</strong></p> <p>My postbag is full of letters from local people who were victims of the Equitable Life scandal. As one Islington woman writes: \"Thousands of ordinary people like me tried to do what they were told by the government and save sensibly for retirement, only to lose large amounts of their hard-earned savings\". Equitable Life was technically insolvent, yet the regulators did nothing to prevent what another woman calls \"a cruel deception ... We were led to believe we were saving for our retirement in a blue-chip provider of the highest integrity ... We took comfort from the words 'regulated by the DTI, Treasury and FSA'. Those words obviously meant nothing at all.\" </p> <p>Equitable Life is the most extreme example of the fallout from the Conservative government's \"light touch\" regulation of pensions - made worse by what the Ombudsman last month declared \"<a href=\"http://www.ombudsman.org.uk/news/press_releases/pr2008_07el.html\">a decade of regulatory failure\"</a> under Labour.<br> The government has ignored previous reports, despite repeated verdicts that the regulators failed to protect policy holders. Lib Dem MEP <a href=\"http://www.dianawallismep.org.uk/pages/equitablelife.html\">Diana Wallis</a> worked on a highly critical EU report that demanded compensation for Equitable Life policy holders, and described the government's failure to respond as \"immoral and illegal\".</p> <p>Up to a million policy holders have been affected, and tragically thousands have died before any compensation was in prospect. But now it looks as if Gordon Brown might finally be shamed into announcing some compensation for Equitable Life victims. The government has said they will respond to the report in the autumn. An admission of failure and an apology would be a welcome first step; openness on plans for compensation must follow.</p>",

Photograph: Eamonn McCabe</p> <p>In his latest novel, The Widows of Eastwick, which will be published in October, John Updike puts these words into the mouth of one of his characters: \"...print doesn't mean to people what it used to, it may be. A considerable number get what news they need off the internet. They don't need much. Sports, celebrities. For self-advertisement there's all this blogging. It's amazing to me that anyone has time to read such crap, but I guess they do.\"</p> <p>It's fair to assume that this opinion is not far from the author's own. In an address to booksellers at the Book Expo convention in Washington, in 2006, Updike spelled out his belief that the <a href=\"www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/books/review/25updike.html \">web was bad for literature</a>, saying: \"Yes, there is a ton of information on the web, but much of it is egregiously inaccurate, unedited, unattributed and juvenile.\" He's right, of course, but the situation he describes could be equally applied to the publishing industry at any stage since Gutenberg invented movable type. Not every imprint is a beacon of exactness and probity.</p> <p>As I struggled to make my way through this tepid follow-up to The Witches of Eastwick, it struck me that the irrelevance of the novel was not entirely due to the fact that it laboriously details the aches and pains of white, middle-class American matrons. Rather, its insignificance lies in the fact the characters inhabit a world that has disappeared. When they are not gossiping on land line telephones, the three widows write long information-strewn letters to each other which they despatch via the mail. It's been a long time since my postman delivered anything other than final demands and takeaway flyers. Sukie, one of the main characters, is dismayed to find upon returning to Eastwick that the rather smart local newspaper she helped produce has been closed down and replace by a cheap Xeroxed sheet. Xerox? Even the smallest hamlets now have their dedicated websites providing details on the latest ominous planning development and a 24-hour webcam trained on the duck pond.</p> <p>At least I read The Widows of Eastwick to the end. I gave up on Updike's last novel, Terrorist, at the point where the reader was introduced to a West Indian school teacher who had never heard of Jennifer Lopez. If Updike spent even a little time in the, admittedly often dispiriting, online environment, his characters might seem less ossified.</p> <p>Updike makes no secret of <a href=\"http://www.nerve.com/screeningroom/books/interview_johnupdike/ \">his aversion to the web</a> and it is clear he will not be wasting his time reading this or any other online opinion of his novels. That's fair enough - but whether a novelist such as Updike can so blithely ignore the seismic shift in how we gather our information is a moot point. As he explains in a collection of essays and criticism, Odd Jobs: \"To begin to write, I needed the sensation that I was about to reveal what had never yet been quite revealed...\" This venturesome sense of wonder is, to me, at the heart of Updike's appeal. His withdrawal from the hurly-burly of contemporary communication may be one reason why his novels have become less despatches from the frontline than cosy remembrances of things past.</p>",
  "<p>John Lewis, the department store chain seen as barometer of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/retail\">Britain's retail sector</a>, said its latest weekly sales took a hit as shoppers were distracted by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics2008\">Beijing Olympics</a> and school exam results.</p> <p>The employee-owned store chain said that sales in the week to August 16 at its 26 stores across the UK fell 4.2% to \u00a347.2m - the 10th week in 15 that sales have suffered as consumers cut back on their spending due to higher fuel, food and mortage costs as well as economic uncertainity.</p> <p>John Lewis said sales were particularly subdued that week due to distractions such as sporting events and A-Level results. Out of town stores, such as Bluewater and Cribbs Causeway, also had another poor week while the online business showed good growth.</p> <p>The retailer's plight echoes many other shops on the high street. While like-for-like sales for John Lewis have held up fairly well in the face of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/18/inflation.recession\">possible recession</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/02/marksspencer.retail\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a>, Next and Laura Ashley have endured hefty falls.</p> <p>Sellers of high priced goods, such as furniture and white ticket items like washing machines, are suffering the most with fewer people moving home as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/12/houseprices.mortgages\">housing market weakens</a> rapidly. </p> <p>However, official figures yesterday showed a surprise rise in sales in July, which was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/22/retail.economics\">greeted with scepticism</a> by economists.</p> <p>John Lewis's subdued performance was driven by falls in the home category as well as declines in electrical goods and home technology.</p> <p>At the group's chain of 189 Waitrose supermarkets, sales increased 2.3% to \u00a372.4m despite high food price inflation.</p> <p>Total John Lewis Partnership sales fell 0.3% to \u00a3119.6m.</p>"
