  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain's</a> campaign - even according to his supporters - is running into trouble. Most polls have him trailing <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> by significant margins. Here the Guardian asks top US commentators whether the race is now over or whether he can pull off a remarkable comeback.</p> <h2>Frank Luntz<br>Republican pollster and consultant</h2> <p>\"He hasn't lost it, but it is slipping away. He will need a brilliant debate performance next week or it will be too late. McCain has realised that he needs to fight. He has just forgotten who he is fighting for. It's not a fight against Obama. He should be fighting for the hard-working taxpayer and it doesn't come across that way. He is demonstrating the difference in his policy but he should be demonstrating why he is better for hard-working, middle-class taxpayers ... The way the media works, the way the economy is coming apart, the only chance for McCain is when everybody is watching.\"</p> <h2>David Johnson<br>Republican strategist<br>Worked on Bob Dole's campaign in 1996</h2> <p>\"If the election were held today, yeah, he's toast. John McCain isn't able to make a dent. People have tuned him out. That's also beginning to seep down to your rank-and-file Republicans, and panic is beginning to set in. He needs to change his message. John McCain needs to get in front of a camera and say: 'I'm not as polished and not as charismatic as my opponent, but we're facing an economic crisis. We need leadership and this is my plan.' Like Churchill ... he needs to make America understand that he's going to roll up his sleeves and he's not going to stop until he's got victory.\"</p> <h2>Elaine Kamarck<br>White House aide to Bill Clinton and Democratic superdelegate<br>Kennedy School of Government</h2> <p>\"We know historically that when people are concerned about their pocket books they turn to the Democratic party. It doesn't look like this economic crisis is going to go away. John McCain is fighting an uphill battle, historically. He made a very good start last night, which nobody paid attention to, which is this proposal on foreclosures. He's got two or three weeks to somehow overcome the prejudice among the voters that the Republicans are somehow responsible for this and that they're not the ones to handle this. It's a tall order, because this is not something that comes naturally to him ... He's got two options: he can try to change the conversation, which is extremely difficult given the severity of the financial crisis, or he can try to compete on the economic front.\"</p> <h2>Stephen Hess<br>Brookings Institution<br>Worked for presidents from Eisenhower to Carter</h2> <p>\"If McCain were to win this election I think it would truly be the biggest upset in American political history, and I say that not as a partisan but as a political historian ... It's as if Herbert Hoover would have won in 1932. I don't think you can have an economic situation this bad, and not expect to throw out the in party ... By now much of it is set in concrete as far as the fundamentals.\"</p> <h2>Matt Bennett<br>Co-founder of Third Way, a Democratic thinktank</h2> <p>\"I would say that he's in intensive care but not quite in hospice at the moment. He's definitely not finished, we're just too far out, and this race has lurched too quickly from one side to the other. But there's no question that he better turn it around fast. I don't know that there's anything he can do that's within his control. The reason he's not finished is not because he could pull something out of his hat, but because there could be [external] events that could save his campaign. He's just not a skilled enough campaigner and he's in such a tight spot that there's no magic bullet he could fire. He needs to hope for something else to save him.\"</p> <h2>David Yepsen<br>Political columnist, The Des Moines Register</h2> <p>\"No, he is not finished. It is still doable for McCain, and there is just under a month to the election ... But he has got to talk about specific solutions on the economy. There are also two wild cards in this race. One is race: how many people can't vote for Obama because of his race. We know it's out there, but people don't like to talk about it and it's difficult to measure. The other wild card is voters under 25, the millennials. There are huge registration numbers out there. The challenge will be to produce those young people. It's one thing to sign them up. It's another to turn them out.\"</p> <h2>James Antle<br>Associate editor of the American Spectator</h2> <p>\"John McCain almost did the impossible: for a period after the Republican convention it looked like he might extend his party's grip on the White House for another four years. Independent voters liked him, conservatives loved Sarah Palin. The Democrats seemed utterly unprepared for this strange turn of events. And then came the financial meltdown. McCain - to paraphrase Sam Cooke - don't know much about the economy. Democrats are made to campaign in times like these. The only remaining advantage for McCain is that he has kept the race just close enough to benefit from any last-minute blunder by Barack Obama. McCain has been an extraordinarily lucky candidate. But his luck looks like it has run out.\"</p> <h2>David Gergen<br>Former White House adviser to Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Clinton</h2> <p>\"The issue of race is still rearing its head in this campaign and we don't know how that it is going to play out. This has been such a volatile campaign and the issue of race has been so unresolved that I don't think you can say with any confidence Obama is going to win. The Obama people are not acting as if they are confident ... If I were John McCain I would go into a meeting with the best economic minds in the country and determine where the economy is going and where they can go to cope with this crisis, and give a speech on the economy Monday and Tuesday of next week and take that into the next debate.\"</p> <h2>Anne Hallum<br>Political science professor at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida</h2> <p>\"I don't think he's lost the election, at least from Florida's standpoint, because it is only three points apart, but favouring Obama. I have memories of 2000, when Gore lost by only 537 votes. He's in a tough spot, because he's running against his own party. But Americans are tired of the negative attacks. That's why these first early polls are showing Obama won [the debate last night] because McCain was so negative. It's standard for the person who's behind to be negative. For McCain to turn this around he's got to be positive, stay on point, stay clear with his policy statements ... The odds are against McCain, except that Obama is counting on 18- to 24-year-olds, who aren't reliable.\"</p>",
  "<p>John McCain narrowed the focus of his campaign yesterday after failing to deliver the game-changing performance he needed in his presidential debate against Barack Obama. With instant polls awarding the debate to Obama, McCain's advisers refocused the campaign on a narrow field of battleground states. That suggests a best-case scenario for the Republican of a very slim victory over Obama.</p> <p>The McCain camp also signalled an attempt to return to a more issues-based campaign, focused on the economy, only days after announcing a \"gloves off\" attack on Obama's character and his former associations in Chicago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338422059\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps and graphs/2008/10/9/1223537342238/uspollgraph.jpg\" alt=\"The verdict from Tennessee\" width=\"220\" height=\"634\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The verdict from Tennessee</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking after Tuesday's televised debate in Nashville, Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, set out a narrow strategy that allows little room for manoeuvre. The Republicans' hopes now rest on holding on to the 252 electoral votes that President George Bush won in 2004 and on taking Pennsylvania from the Democrats. The state, with its 21 electoral votes, would push him over the 270 college votes needed to win. </p> <p>Obama, in contrast, is in a position to expand his playing field, and is buying television advertising and making campaign appearances in traditional Republican states such as Indiana and North Carolina.</p> <p>At a rally in Indianapolis, the Democrat pushed back hard against McCain's attempt to relaunch his campaign on healthcare and the economy, telling people not to be \"bamboozled\". He reminded the crowd that McCain had only a day or two earlier been fighting the election on issues of character. \"The McCain campaign actually said, and I am quoting, 'if we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose'.\"</p> <p>McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, headed straight from Nashville for a joint rally in the Pennsylvania steel town of Bethlehem. McCain is to push his plan, unexpectedly announced during the debate, for a $300bn government programme to help homeowners facing the loss of their homes.</p> <p>The problem for McCain is that polls show that voters in Pennsylvania, as in other states, have shifted to Obama in droves in the past fortnight as a result of the economic crisis. The RealClearPolitics website, which keeps a running tally of polls, put Obama on 51% in Pennsylvania against McCain on 39%.</p> <p>McCain also faces a financial gap against Obama. After accepting public finance, he is restricted to spending $84m on the election, while Obama, who has broken all previous fundraising records, can raise funds and spend without limit.</p> <p>Obama so far has spent $6m more a week on TV advertising, according to Ken Goldstein, a University of Wisconsin professor who monitors campaign advertising. The Democrats plan to increase their ad buy by 20% a week.</p> <p>Obama is outspending McCain in such key battlegrounds as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida, as well as traditionally Republican territory such as North Carolina and Indiana.</p> <p>McCain has one major opportunity left to try to overcome those disadvantages in the last of the three presidential debates, in New York next Wednesday.</p> <p>In an acknowledgment that McCain's performance on Tuesday night had failed to shift the public focus on the economy, one of his key advisers, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, accused the moderator, Tom Brokaw, of hijacking the debate's format.</p> <p>A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll taken immediately after the debate awarded it to Obama by a margin of 54% to 30%, with the rest giving it as a tie.</p> <p>The age gap between the two men - Obama is 47, McCain 72 - has seldom been as obvious. When asked during the debate how the economic crisis would affect the three top priorities of his administration, McCain appeared unable to remember what they were and jotted down a note.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's rapidly deflating housing market, the vulnerability of the City and the poor state of the public finances will drive the British economy into its first recession in almost two decades next year, the International Monetary Fund warned last night.</p> <p>The IMF used its half-yearly world economic outlook to issue a dismal prognosis for the UK economy, slashing its growth forecast for 2009 from 1.7% to -0.1%, and stressing that measures to bail out Britain's banks would take time to work. \"The process of balance sheet repair will be long and arduous,\" it said. </p> <p>Although the IMF downgraded its forecasts for all western economies as a result of what it called the \"most dangerous shock\" to financial markets since the 1930s, the cut for the UK was bigger than for any other developed country.</p> <p>Britain will be the second-worst performing country in the G7 group of industrial countries next year, the IMF said. Canada, helped by its exports of raw materials, will see the strongest expansion at 1.2%, Japan will grow by 0.5%, France by 0.2%, the US by 0.1% and Germany will see its economy stagnate. Only Italy, projected to suffer a 0.2% fall in output, will have a tougher year than the UK.</p> <p>In a separate blow, the publication of the World Economic Forum's annual league table of competitiveness saw the UK drop out of the top 10, falling from ninth to 12th. The US, despite the problems of its sub-prime mortgage sector and the need for a $700bn rescue plan for its banks, came top.</p> <p>Yesterday's IMF report was in stark contrast to the tone of its comments during the past decade, when it has tended to single out the UK for praise, both for its economic performance and its policy-making apparatus. If the forecasts prove accurate, the British economy will still be growing only slowly by the time of the next general election. The IMF said that the UK would slow from 3% in 2007 to 1% this year and continue to weaken in 2009. In 1991, the economy contracted by more than 1%, a far bigger slowdown than currently being predicted by the IMF. It stressed, however, that the risks to its forecast were \"to the downside\".</p> <p>Unemployment is expected to rise sharply to 6% of the workforce in 2009, while the slowing economy will drag inflation back below the government's 2% target by the end of next year. Public finances meanwhile are \"considerably weaker\" than at the time of the dotcom recession earlier this decade. </p> <p>Alistair Darling will accept in next month's pre-budget report that the weakness of the economy will have a big impact on the public finances, with tax receipts heavily dependent on the City and the housing market. The IMF predicted that the deficit on the UK's public finances would balloon to 4.4% of GDP next year, from 2.7% in 2007, before the credit crunch began to take its toll on revenues.</p> <p>It singled out the UK's housing market as a particular source of weakness, warning that it had experienced - together with Ireland and Australia - one of the largest \"unexplained\" increases in property prices over the past decade. In all three countries, the IMF said, prices were 20-30% higher last year than could be justified by \"fundamentals\" such as rising population or higher incomes.</p> <p>The IMF's world economic outlook said housing markets had turned down across western Europe. \"The most severe downswings have been concentrated in a few national markets - Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom - which had experienced the most rapid house price appreciation or the greatest building booms, but house prices are slowing more broadly.\"</p> <p>Olivier Blanchard, the IMF's economic counsellor, welcomed the coordinated cuts in interest rates and bail-outs of struggling banks. </p> <p>\"There will be tough economic times ahead,\" Blanchard said. \"The re-establishment of trust or, more formally, the decline in counter-party risk within the financial system, will take time. During that time, credit to the ultimate borrowers will be limited and expensive.\"</p> <p>Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank, said the credit crunch had also created a \"human crisis\" in many of the poorest countries, which required a coordinated response. He said the number of malnourished people was expected to increase by 44 million this year to 967 million as a result of high food prices. </p> <p>Despite its pessimistic assessment, the IMF said the risk of a new Great Depression was small. It expects 9% growth in China, 7% in India and 6% in Africa to partly offset the weakness in the west. Overall, the IMF is forecasting 3% growth in the global economy.</p>",
  "<h2>Tourists among 18 killed in mountain air crash</h2> <p>Twelve German tourists died yesterday when their small plane crashed and caught fire at a tiny mountainside airport 40 miles from Mount Everest. Two Australians and two Nepalese tourists also died in the crash, along with two crew members. The Yeti Airlines pilot survived. The DHC-6 Twin Otter plane en route from the capital, Kathmandu, snagged its wheels on a fence in fog at Lukla airport, said Mohan Adhikari, the general manager at Kathmandu. He added: \"All the passengers waiting for planes ran to help douse the flames, but the passengers were already dead.\"<br><strong>Associated Press in Kathmandu</strong></p> <h2>Historic election may oust leader after 30 years</h2> <p>Thousands of people voted yesterday in the first democratic presidential elections in the Maldives, which could see Asia's longest-serving leader, President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, ousted by a human rights activist he once jailed. Gayoom, the 71-year-old Maldivian strongman for the past 30 years, faces five rivals in the election, which is the culmination of a peaceful democracy movement that evolved after violent riots in 2005. The most serious threat to his rule is the founder of the Maldivian Democratic party, Mohamed \"Anni\" Nasheed, a former prisoner of conscience.<br><strong>Randeep Ramesh</strong></p> <h2>Civilian death toll from US air strike revised to 30</h2> <p>US officials say American air strikes in Afghanistan on August 22 killed about 30 civilians, far more than the military had previously acknowledged. An investigation found that the strikes against a suspected Taliban compound in the western province of Herat had more fatalities than the five to seven the US originally acknowledged, according to a Pentagon official. The Afghan government and UN had said that the operation killed some 90 civilians. An original US investigation found that up to 35 militants and seven civilians were killed in the strikes, which strained US-Afghan relations.<br><strong>Associated Press in Washington</strong></p> <h2>Microchips used to foil Arizona cactus thieves</h2> <p>Anyone stealing a saguaro cactus from the Arizona desert could soon be hauling off more than just a large plant. US national park service officials plan to embed microchips in examples of Arizona's signature plant to protect them from thieves, who rip them from the desert to sell to landscapers, nurseries and homeowners, typically for $1,000 (\u00a3580). The primary objective is deterrence, but the chips will also aid in tracking down and identifying stolen saguaros, said Bob Love, chief ranger at Saguaro national park. \"There's probably more of it that occurs than we're aware of,\" he said.<br><strong>Associated Press in Tucson</strong></p>",
  "<p>He was about the last person you would expect to devise an economy theory for state intervention. Educated at Eton and Cambridge, a don with a flair for making money, and a Bloomsbury group aesthete, John Maynard Keynes enjoyed nothing more than proving Victorian morality wrong. So he relished the paradox of thrift: the idea that if everyone saves at the same time, the collapse in demand drags down national income to the point where the value of what is being saved is reduced. Keynes's greatest thinking is contained in an indigestible tome called The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money - a title which aped Einstein's magnum opus (modesty was not one of Keynes's many favourable attributes). In it, he said that government action was often the only route out of recession; that insight still provides our best hope of avoiding a rerun of the Great Depression today. No intellectual was more engaged with the world of his times. After the first world war, he was a delegate to the Paris peace conference, where he predicted the trouble that would flow from the vindictive war reparations being imposed on Germany; after the second, he brokered the creation of the Bretton Woods system. His name was posthumously associated with the sloppy notion that paying ourselves ever more would lead to prosperity, but his thinking was more subtle than that. Keynes had no patience with economists who argued that everything would work out in the long run. He wrote: \"In the long run we are all dead.\"</p>",
  "<p>There are pretty flowers and folderols everywhere, soft cushions and soft-footed waiters. Coffee and little sugary biscuits are served. I take the coffee black and don't eat the biscuits, though I am breakfast-less. Sugar is anathema to New Yorkers, I know, and Judy Sheindlin is very New York, tiny, elegant, charming and wise-crackingly clever. I must want her to think well of me. </p> <p>\"Have a cookie,\" she suggests.</p> <p>\"No thanks,\" I say. It's not so much that I want her approval, I realise. I fear her disapproval. </p> <p>Judge Judy is a TV show watched daily by 10 million people worldwide, most of them women, and after 12 years of public popularity and critical non-attention is into its 11th series for CBS and still going strong. Sheindlin acts as a latter-day Queen Solomon, to whom the people bring their grievances against one another, and as such she doles out swift and scathing justice, threatening to cut the baby in half to decide who is the real mother. As befits the century, it's done from a TV screen, not a throne, in the form of a reality-show small claims court, and publicists, not prophets, extol her. </p> <p>\"Being a TV star is a great gift,\" she says. \"Everyone treats you royally. I started out in a two-room apartment in Brooklyn, and thought, 'Never again.' Now all this.\" And she gestures round the grandeur of London's Dorchester hotel, this mother of five, grandmother to 11, wife of a retired high court judge. Then she complains that she hasn't slept. She had to move rooms to get away from a faulty air-conditioner and spent the night on a sofa with a towel beneath and a towel on top. \"Even though I am a star,\" she adds, \"it's the kind of thing that still happens.\" </p> <p>I say I know what it's like. However hard I try, I still end up toiling up some hill in the rain with a carrier bag in each hand and a toddler clinging to my legs, and she looks at me with pity: too much. For her, it would never get quite as low as that. </p> <p>For 25 years Sheindlin was a \"real\" family court judge in New York, notorious for her fast decisions and wise-cracking judgments, appreciated as the scourge of villains and the friend of the oppressed. And then TV discovered her and she became a reality-show judge instead, bringing her experience and attitudes with her, as she roots out liars, exposes cheats and berates vandals. She believed, and still believes, that young offenders need a sharp shock. \"Five per cent were real bad apples,\" she says. \"The other 95% were just trying to survive the only way they knew. But that does not excuse them.\" She has no time for a liberal press that finds excuses for antisocial behaviour and so encourages it. Oddly, the \"real\" people who turn up for her judgments seem to concur: they are content to abide by Judy's decisions, no matter how they are humbled and exposed, or smirk or rage after the show. It may be, of course, merely that the production company pays the fines she imposes, so contestants - those accused of cheating on eBay, bullied at school, sued by their mothers, persecuted by ex-spouses, or whatever, seem eager enough to turn up. It is Jerry Springer without the schadenfreude or noisy vulgarity, The Weakest Link without the spite.</p> <p>The Judge Judy show dominates the ITV2 midweek daytime schedules, or you can watch a selection of her Solomonic judgments on YouTube, where 10-minute chunks of her programmes are freely available.</p> <p>The path from Brooklyn to Hollywood - in 2006 she became the 2,304th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame - was scarcely of her making. It just evolved. She had a secure and happy beginning - she describes her dentist father as \"the greatest thing since sliced bread\" and her mother as \"a meat-and-potatoes kind of gal\". Only when her father died did she realise to what degree her mother was \"the glue that kept the family together. But then most women are.\" </p> <p>A bright, argumentative girl, Sheindlin went to a tough state school, on to New York Law School and in 1965 began to practise law in Manhattan. In 1972 she moved on to the family court, where she prosecuted juvenile delinquency cases for the State of New York. Her approach was simple, caustic and forthright. \"Take responsibility for yourself, your actions and the children you bring into the world. No excuses.\" </p> <p>By the time she was outed by the TV programme 60 Minutes as a potential star, she had sat through more than 20,000 family cases. She had learned how to get through to people. \"You have to make them listen, and you have to talk sense, and then they'll hear you.\" It made sense to use these rare skills to speak to the masses through a TV courtroom, and not to the few individuals in a real one. </p> <p>She is described as acid-tongued and brutally sarcastic, but I see no evidence of it. She is more like a busy mother, beside herself with anxiety for the welfare of a troublesome child. When she tells a recalcitrant male litigant, \"You're nothing special! Believe me, I have three sons so I know. You are no gift - you're not even good-looking,\" it is done to bring him to his senses, before he gets into worse trouble, rather than in an attempt to humiliate him. And still they come back for more. </p> <p>She is reassuring and funny, both stern father and anxious mother to an audience I suspect she sees as dumb and getting dumber, and in dire need of reform. She is all for the swift, sharp shock of punishment, seeing it as the only approach to juvenile crime that works. I protest that the US already has the highest rate of youth imprisonment in the world, second only to China. She looks at me with sharp, intelligent eyes. \"So?\" she says. \"Get them early and get them hard. Then they won't come back. The choice is theirs.\"</p> <p>Fortunately these days the wealth of Solomon accompanies the love of the people. In a recent survey of Hollywood's best-paid \"talkers\", Sheindlin came joint third on $45m, with David Letterman, behind Oprah Winfrey and Howard Stern. Indeed, she has just built herself a magnificent Versailles of a temple in Greenwich, Connecticut: 24,000 sq ft, 17 bathrooms, taking 400 labourers a mere 20 weeks to build, complete with fancy ready-made grounds transported thither in tubs. A Sims computer game construction for most of us, but for her, real. She impresses even herself. \"The ceilings are higher even than they are here,\" she says. </p> <p>She is a Brooklyn girl made good and does not forget it: high-powered, industrious, conscious of her responsibility. She believes celebrities must set an example: be like our Queen, not Britney's teenage sister - pregnant out of wedlock and setting a fashion for teenage pregnancies, which the tax-payer will have to support. She seems motivated less by ambition than by a genuine social conscience - she feels it would be immodest to claim 10 out of 10 for the latter. I award her a nine, inasmuch as in the UK, unlike in the US, we are suspicious of immoderate wealth. </p> <p>I ask her about the election. She says it is touch and go. She is a friend of McCain - \"a real meat-and-potatoes guy\" - but likes Obama. He represents youth and hope and the capacity to trust, since no one knows anything about him. Everyone wants to vote for him - but in the quiet and secrecy of the voting booth, who knows what will happen? Caution may triumph over trust. </p> <p>Different personalities seem to pop out of this tiny, graceful, powerful person speaking from the depths of her hotel armchair throne. Sometimes it is Mary Poppins, sometimes Supernanny, sometimes Barry Goldwater, the American politician known as Mr Conservative. She is \"reactionary\" in distrusting the liberal media, seeing it as having fostered the blame culture to the detriment of society, \"progressive\" in her approval of the feistiness of Michelle Obama.</p> <p>Before we part, the photographer turns up and you remember this slip of a woman from Brooklyn is a star. There is a kind of focusing of energy here that the camera loves; so does she. </p> <p>\"Your top is uneven,\" tactfully murmurs her publicity guy. The black top has slipped over her shoulder to show a sliver of white. </p> <p>\"It is as I mean it to be,\" she replies sharply, and he quickly shuts up. She pulls the top down even further over her shoulder, and is instantly glamorous. She is right and he is wrong. It is this particular talent that has brought her to this point in life. She is everyone's tough but loving parent where parents are reluctant to be parents and want, disastrously in her view, to be buddies. Do what she says and you'll survive; defy her and you'll perish. </p> <p>We have a picture taken together.</p> <p>\"I never know whether to keep my head up or down,\" I complain.</p> <p>\"Up,\" she says, \"always up.\" I do as she says. Of course, she's right. </p> <p>Reality TV - or semi-reality TV, as this is - is here to stay. We shouldn't complain: it is the people's choice. The producer's time has come. The contriver of the programme gets the glory; the writer and director are lucky if they get a mention. The cheaper daytime shows - property, cooking, lifestyle, courtroom - slop over into evening viewing. If we want information we go to the internet now, not a documentary. If we want drama there's the news and the goings-on of celebrities. If we want a stage not a screen we can go to a musical. The power of personality remains: Judge Judy has spawned a host of imitators, but none has her charisma, or her ratings. </p> <p>A pity McCain didn't choose her, rather than Palin, for his running mate. Her idea of solving juvenile delinquency by having every woman implanted at birth with a contraceptive chip, to be taken out only on request, might cause some controversy. But one can see her point. At least every child born would be a wanted child, and not - as she sees it as being in the US - the result of an accident and a bottle of vodka.</p> <p>She believes in the legal system. \"All those good people huddling behind bars in gated communities - it's the wrong way round. The others should have the bars.\" And as I go she says, \"It took them 13 years to get OJ Simpson but they got him. What goes around, comes around\" </p> <h2>The 'idiot' teenager</h2> <p>A 17-year-old girl moves in with her boyfriend's family.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica\">South Africa's</a> ruling African National Congress is on the brink of splitting after senior allies of the toppled president, Thabo Mbeki, said yesterday that they were \"serving divorce papers\" on the new party leadership under Jacob Zuma because it had abandoned the movement's founding principles and put \"our national democracy in danger\".</p> <p>Mosiuoa Lekota, a former political prisoner and party chairman who quit as defence minister when Mbeki was forced out as president last month, said he and other disillusioned officials planned to canvass for support within the ANC in a process that seems to be \"leading logically\" to the creation of a new political party to run in next year's general election. </p> <p>\"This is probably the parting of the ways,\" said Lekota. </p> <p>Lekota accused the new leadership of hijacking the ANC and \"eliminating our internal democracy\" in order to make Zuma the ruling party's candidate at the election and to stop him facing trial on corruption charges. \"These elements who are not committed to these principles of the ANC may well decorate themselves with the name ANC but they are not ANC ... The current leadership have shown they are not ANC,\" he said.</p> <p>Lekota was flanked by the former deputy defence minister Mluleki George but is not clear how many senior officials he can carry with him, although he said there are significant numbers of rank and file members who oppose the existing leadership. Lekota's influence was severely undermined after he failed to assert control as chairman of the party conference that saw Mbeki deposed as ANC leader last year. </p> <p>The ANC leadership quickly derided Lekota's move, accusing him and his supporters of being bitter at losing control of the party. ANC spokeswoman Jesse Duarte said the dissidents were \"launching a stillborn organisation\" because they had no future in the party.</p> <p>\"They were never willing to accept the will of the members of the ANC and they have therefore pursued other avenues to advance their careers,\" she said.</p> <p>Zuma warned ANC members that they did not have a blank cheque to destabilise the party. </p> <p>While any new political party will face a formidable challenge to take significant support from the ANC, despite growing disillusionment among ordinary voters, the bitterness of Lekota's attack on Zuma and his allies reflects the deep schisms that could see other factions break away, particularly on the left over economic policy.</p> <p>\"There has been elevated to national importance interests of individuals rather than the interests of our country,\" said Lekota. </p> <p>He accused the new party leadership of betraying the ANC's Freedom Charter, which formed the basis of the liberation struggle, by demanding that there be a \"political solution\" to prevent Zuma facing trial for corruption which could see him sent to prison for years. </p> <p>\"South Africans are getting arrested from time to time. They have to appear before the courts and they have to bring evidence to prove that they are innocent or not. Now we are saying, no, in a particular case - of the state versus the president of the ANC - there must be a political solution. What has happened to the clause in the Freedom Charter: all shall be equal before the law?\" he said.</p> <p>Lekota also said that the Zuma camp had introduced tribalism into the party's internal politics with a campaign projecting Zuma as \"100% Zulu boy\" and promoted violence with Zuma's trademark song, Bring Me My Machine Gun.</p> <p>\"Leaders of the ANC stand on public platforms singing songs that advocate violence and the collection of weapons. To what end? To promote what policy of the ANC?\" he said.</p> <p>But Lekota's accusation that the new ANC leadership is \"eliminating internal democracy\" with a purge of Mbeki's supporters and attacks on Zuma's critics will ring hollow among many of Mbeki's critics who were hounded with a vicious vilification campaign by the former president's backers. </p> <p>Confirming that he has virtually made up his mind to launch a rival party, Lekota said it would challenge Zuma at the ballot box. \"Of course we have to contest the elections next year ... the people of our country must choose between ourselves and those who have taken a different route,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Is it \"the one\" or \"that one\"? It depends on John McCain's mood. The Republican apparently believes both designations are equally appropriate for his Democratic opponent, Barack Obama.</p> <p>In an exchange on energy in Tuesday night's debate, McCain referred to Obama as \"that one\". The Democrats immediately claimed the comment as evidence of his disdain for Obama.</p> <p>In the spin alley after the debate, Obama aides laboured strenuously to make the case that McCain's use of the words \"that one\" exposed the Republican candidate as angry and erratic and - not so subtly - old. However the Republican candidate's utterance made much less impact on television viewers than it did on spin doctors. The alleged dissing of Obama did not gain much traction yesterday,</p> <p>And it turns out McCain is equally at home with calling Obama \"the one\" - a reference Republicans believe shows up the Democrats' messianic pretensions.</p> <p>Yesterday a verbal gaffe by McCain swiftly made its way on to Youtube, after he addressed a Pennsylvania crowd as \"my fellow prisoners\".</p> <p>Describing his plans for the economy, McCain, who often speaks of his time in a Vietnamese jail, said: \"Across this country, this is the agenda I have set before my fellow prisoners.\"</p>",
  "<p>As if there were not enough real enemies to fight, the United States has been at war with itself in recent years. They call it the culture war. It has generated more hot air than most real wars in history. John McCain has now turned to its red army tactics to rescue himself from impending defeat - and Sarah Palin is his Katyusha.</p> <p>\"There is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America,\" declared the conservative nationalist Pat Buchanan at the Republican national convention in 1992. \"It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the cold war itself.\" Later that year he explained that \"the Bosnia of the cultural war is abortion\". As Buchanan foresaw, this has been a war for power: not military power, but the kind that comes from shaping the norms, beliefs and values by which people live, and the meanings attached to words like liberalism, patriotism or, indeed, culture. The two sides in this war came to be labelled red and blue, after the colouring of Republican and Democratic states on electoral maps.</p> <p>No one has generated more hot air in this cause than Fox News anchor Bill O'Reilly, who in 2006 published a book proudly called Culture Warrior. He describes the culture war as a battle between traditionalists (\"T-Warriors\") like himself and \"the committed forces of the secular-progressive movement that want to change America dramatically: mold it in the image of western Europe\". Like Europe! God, how horrible.</p> <p>O'Reilly labels these secular-progressive forces \"S-P\", and identifies George Soros as \"El Jefe of the S-P forces\". In a fashion disturbingly familiar to any student of the 20th century, he illustrates this passage with an unflattering photo of the financier-philanthropist, captioned \"George Soros, S-P Jefe, puppet master, and moneyman\". \"Born George Schwartz to a Jewish family in Hungary in 1930,\" he explains, \"Soros assumed the identity of a gentile boy when the Nazis invaded at the start of world war II.\" This is what they call a Fox Fact. (It was Soros's father who changed the family name in 1936 and the Nazis did not invade Hungary until 1944: three errors in the space of one innuendo.) Anyway, what should that personal history have to do with an argument about cultural and social policies in 21st-century America?</p> <p>Excoriating \"leftwing outfits like the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the British Broadcasting Company\" (Foxy Fact-checking again: it's the British Broadcasting Corporation), O'Reilly pounds the hot buttons of the culture war with a ham fist: abortion, drugs, gay marriage, not celebrating Christmas, atheism, the liberal or - as he prefers - \"S-P\" media and elites. The New York Times, he says in an afterword to the paperback edition, has \"morphed into a brochure for secular-progressive causes\". And so it goes on. And on.</p> <p>Does this matter? Over the past decade it has mattered a lot. The framing of the political debate in cultural conservative terms - a counter-revolution against the cultural revolution of 1968 - contributed significantly to George Bush's election victories in 2000 and 2004. And one way of understanding the direction taken by the McCain campaign over the past few weeks is this: only the culture war can win it for us now. On Iraq, we lose. On the economy, we lose. But by caricaturing the liberal otherness of a candidate called Barack Obama, perhaps we can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.</p> <p>Enter Sarah Palin, the Katyusha rocket of red America. (I trust she won't mind a Russian analogy since, as she has informed us, you - or at least she - can see Russia from Alaska.) The selection of such an obviously under-qualified candidate for vice-president can only be explained by electoral calculation, and that calculation has everything to do with the politics of the country's cultural civil war. Her kind of down-home populist inveighing against Washington elites (add \"liberal\" or \"S-P\" according to taste) is part of the well-tried semantic armoury of the red army.</p> <p>Katyusha Palin now leads the attacks on Obama. This week she has repeatedly tried to tar-and-feather him by association with former terrorist William Ayers. The not-even-subliminal message is: he's not like us, he's like them. The others: elites, liberals, subversives, immigrants and infidels, closet Europeans! Chapter one of O'Reilly's Culture Warrior begins with an imagined 2020 state of the union speech by a president of the United States called Gloria Hernandez: hispanic, and a woman to boot. Worse still, she celebrates the United States as \"a diversified nation striving to be at peace with the world\". How terrifying. How blood-curdling. Give us President Palin any day.</p> <p>For Gloria Hernandez read Barack Obama. Or \"that one\", as McCain disrespectfully referred to him in Tuesday night's presidential debate. At the moment, the tactic isn't working. This election is about the economy, stupid. The pocketbook trumps the prayer book. However much McCain lauds himself as a \"maverick\", he can't disassociate himself from eight years of Republican rule that are ending in the biggest financial crisis since 1929 and a near-doubling of the national debt. And Obama is better on the economy: clearer, more specific, always bringing it back to the everyday struggles of ordinary Americans. In the instant-reaction polls, a clear majority thought Obama won that debate, as he is winning in most of the polls both nationwide and in key battleground states.</p> <p>Even if the red-clawed tactics of culture war don't pull Obama down at the last minute, an Obama victory won't spell the end of this war. But perhaps it may spell the beginning of the end. Let's be clear: this war will not finish with a victory of blue over red, or vice versa. It will finish with the accepted, peaceful coexistence in one society of different faiths, value systems and lifestyles - along the lines laid down centuries ago by the classical liberalism of John Locke and others, which so much influenced this country's Founding Fathers. It won't be \"liberals\" (in the perverted sense in which that word is now used in the United States) trouncing conservatives, but classical liberalism re-made for the 21st century. It won't be blue obliterating red, but red, white and blue - as in Obama's healing promise earlier in this campaign, that there are not red states and blue states, just the United States.</p> <p>The world needs the United States to get over its cultural civil war, and get over it fast. Not that these moral, cultural and social issues are unimportant. They are among the most important things. But they are also among the most private things. The business of government and the law should be confined to providing a liberal (in the classical sense) framework in which men and women can make personal choices about private goods. That should be only a small part of what government does. By contrast, the central business of government is to provide public goods such as national and personal security, the regulation of markets in which private enterprise can flourish, the international development that is in all our national interests, and a clean environment using diversified, sustainable energy supplies. That's what the United States needs from its new president, and that's what the world needs from the United States.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timothygartonash.com\">www.timothygartonash.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Before I left Bangladesh to attend university in the United States, my parents gave me two warnings. First, they said, please don't become a lesbian (I was going to a women's college); second, please don't major in acting (after a starring role in my high-school production of Romeo and Juliet, I had delusions). \"Why don't you try writing instead?\" my father suggested. </p> <p>\"It's safer.\"</p> <p>I didn't realise how unusual this career advice was until I was about to graduate. My Asian friends were overwhelmingly turning to careers in banking and management consulting; those courses they took - and loved - in psychology or Spanish literature were forgotten in the quest to find \"safe\" <a href=\"http://jobs.theguardian.com/jobs/\">jobs</a>. In the late 90s, jobs in the financial sector came with five-figure starting salaries and tempting perks - free weekends at five-star hotels, expense accounts, gym memberships.</p> <p>I decided to start a PhD. I was told, on the first day of school, that I would never find a job and that even if I did I would probably spend my first few years teaching five classes a week at small-town universities while being crushed by the \"publish or perish\" system. In all the years I struggled through graduate school, buying my clothes at Salvation Army shops, or notching up credit-card debt to feed my book-buying habit, many of my more worldly friends were flying first class and drinking all the champagne they could stomach. </p> <p>This led to my falling out with some of them; I remember one miserable term in New York City, where I spent most evenings counting the rats that ran up and down the street outside my window. I could never afford those West Village restaurants and theatre tickets, and when I did leave my flat, I found their world, the \"real world\", exaggerated and hard to connect to, like an overhyped film.</p> <p>Looking back, graduate school wasn't so bad. I got to sit around and read all day while my banker friends choked themselves into trousersuits and worked 14-hour days; still, I hit 30 without reaching a triple-digit bank balance. By the time it was over - my PhD took seven years - I had decided to follow my father's advice and become a writer. Again the warnings came fast and heavy, but again I was lucky: my parents didn't slap their palms against their foreheads and denounce my risky choice of profession. </p> <p>It turns out they were right. The events of the past two weeks have contradicted our stereotype of the \"starving artist\". While stocks were taking kamikaze nosedives all over the world, Damien Hirst made millions of pounds faster than a Sarah Palin wink. Then last week saw British publishers releasing 800 books on the same day, dubbed Super Thursday by booksellers. In this climate of belt-tightening and credit-crunching, it appears people will give their children books instead of video games for Christmas. Instead of expensive nights out, they will stay indoors, turn down the thermostat, climb under the duvet and read. My job is safe. Phew. </p> <p>Who would have thought that artists and writers would end up holding some of the safest jobs? Don't get me wrong: it's not all roses. I wouldn't recommend the life of a writer to anyone who wants to own more than a travel pass and a veg box subscription. But the notion that jobs in banking, manufacturing and sales are a default for those who don't want to take risks now seems terribly old-fashioned. I hope this uncertain climate will mean that more parents will encourage their children to follow their hearts when they choose a profession. I even imagine a time, in the not too distant future, when a young woman tells her mother she is off to college and wants to get a job in banking. \"Try dancing,\" the mother says. \"It's safer.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Last week I travelled to Bradford to give a reading, where a very nice Indian librarian greeted me and said, \"Your author photo doesn't do you justice - it makes you look black.\" He smiled widely, and I realised that my sallow, sorry, sun-deprived self was supposed to take this as a compliment. Which is when I remembered that we Asians are incorrigibly colourist. It doesn't matter what part of the sub-continent you come from - paler is better. </p> <p>In India, a cream called Fair and Lovely is a bestselling potion that promises to keep women gorgeous and men entranced. It even comes with a shade guide, like those you get with toothpaste these days. I can't count the number of times I have been told by young Asian girls that they must choose their wardrobe according to their skin colour. That won't suit me, they say - I'm too dark. Other words for pale are \"clean\" and \"fresh\". So, upon landing in Dhaka after another pathetic sunless English summer, I am greeted with \"Oh, you're looking so fresh\" or \"My, how clean your skin looks\". No way would Barack Obama ever get elected in South Asia. Knowing that our history of subjugation was in part based on an idea that white is better, isn't it time we stopped insulting ourselves by insisting that paler skin is more beautiful? </p> <p>Come on, brethren - and I mean all of you, librarians and potion-makers alike - get fair and radical, and leave the colourism behind. </p> <p>\u2022 This week Tahmima watched the second United States presidential debate: \"To borrow a term from American wrestling, it was a smack-down! Absolutely no contest. Barack Obama was dignified and self-assured, while John McCain was bewildered, petulant and empty. Cynics and naysayers be damned - I predict a landslide.\"</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/\">Attackerman</a> gets the goods. He <a href=\"http://washingtonindependent.com/11381/petraeus\">reports today in the Windy</a> that David Petraeus, at a lunch at the Heritage Foundation no less (home base of conservative wonkery), made some remarks that seemed to support Obama's view of some foreign policy matters over McCain's.</p> <p>On Afghanistan:</p> <blockquote> <p>Unbidden, Petraeus discussed whether his strategy in Iraq \u2014 protecting the population while cleaving apart the insurgency through reconciliation efforts to crush the remaining hard-core enemies \u2014 could also work in Afghanistan. The question has particular salience as Petraeus takes over U.S. Central Command, which will put him at the helm of all U.S. troops in the Middle East and South Asia, thereby giving him a large role in the Afghanistan war.</p> <p>\"Some of the concepts used in Iraq are transplantable [to Afghanistan] while others perhaps are not,\" he said. \"Every situation is unique.\"</p> <p>Petraeus pointed to efforts by Hamid Karzai's government to negotiate a deal with the Taliban that would potentially bring some Taliban members back to power, saying that if they are \"willing to reconcile,\" it would be \"a positive step.\"</p> <p>In saying that, Petraeus implicitly allied with U.S. Army Gen. David McKiernan, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Last week, McKiernan rejected the idea of replicating the blend of counterinsurgency strategy employed in Iraq. \"The word that I don't use in Afghanistan is the word 'surge,'\" McKiernan said, opting against recruiting Pashtun tribal fighters to supplement Afghan security forces against Al Qaeda and the Taliban. \"There are countless other differences between Iraq and Afghanistan,\" he added.</p> <p>McCain, however, has argued that the Afghanistan war is ripe for a direct replication of Petraeus' Iraq strategy of population-centric counterinsurgency. </p> </blockquote> <p>On negotiation:</p> <blockquote> <p>Petraeus also came out unambiguously in his talk at Heritage for opening communications with America's adversaries, a position McCain is attacking Obama for endorsing. Citing his Iraq experience, Petraeus said, \"You have to talk to enemies.\" He added that it was necessary to have a particular goal for discussion and to perform advance work to understand the motivations of his interlocutors...</p> <p>...Yet Petraeus emphasized throughout his lecture that reaching out to insurgent groups \u2014 some \"with our blood on their hands,\" he said \u2014 was necessary to the ultimate goal of turning them against irreconcilable enemies like Al Qaeda in Iraq.</p> </blockquote> <p>Talking to some people with our blood on their hands. Imagine how it would go down if Barack Obama said that! Anyway, all very interesting because Petraeus is so strongly affiliated with McCain and the GOP generally that he's sometimes thought of a possible Republican presidential candidate in the future.<br></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/video/2008/jan/14/pickens.religion\">I'm not very good with guns</a>. A 9mm Glock sits heavy in my hand and on my conscience. I'm just a short drive away from Virginia Tech where Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people and wounded many others in 2007. With each shot the gunfire echoes all around Cahas mountain and squawking birds pepper the clear blue sky. So when I pull the trigger, I flinch. That, says Carey Garst, my host, is why I keep missing the target.</p> <p>Carey, who has been shooting since he was a teenager, is patient. \"You've got nothing to be scared of,\" he assures me. \"You're on the right side of the gun.\" And then he loads me up with more bullets while I try to forget the lethal force in my hands and put a hole in a paper plate. Later he takes out the AR-15 rifle and I feel as though I am auditioning for yet another sequel to the Matrix. </p> <p>Carey enjoys guns for sport. Not long ago he took a course at the private security firm Blackwater to gain more expertise. He has an entire arsenal in a huge safe in the shed at the back of his house stacked up in front of a picture of Jimi Hendrix. There are pistols, small calibre rifle, rifle and shotgun combinations, something that's good for killing varmints and a fully automatic Uzi that he got a good deal on. He acquires guns like I acquire books. Not to use them but just to have them. He's actually trying to get rid of some because he barely uses them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338415732\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/red/blue_pics/2008/10/08/shooting2.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Younge, shooting\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carey Garst fires off a round while Gary Younge looks on. Photograph: Sean Smith</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But he also thinks they are vital for self-defence. \"If your 80-year-old grandmother is living alone and somebody breaks in, how's she going to protect herself?\" he asks. \"She can't fight him off hand to hand.\" When he describes the attributes of different weapons and shooting styles, he does so in terms of his ability to fire at persons unknown in situations indefinite. At times you wonder whom he seeks to defend himself against. Up here in the hills of Franklin County, 20 miles south of Roanoke, crime is not much of a problem and Carey does not seem like the kind of man who goes looking for trouble.</p> <p>Obama, Carey insists, wants to take his guns. Obama has insisted he doesn't. Carey doesn't believe him. Obama has voted to <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/domestic/Barack_Obama_Gun_Control.htm\">ban semi-automatics </a>and for stiffer licensing laws in the past. And while Carey doesn't think he'll be able to take his guns, the fact that he may want to is reason enough to oppose him. In a state like Virginia, even that perception could hurt Obama badly, which is why the National Rifle Association has been <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/channel-08/2008/09/nra_targets_obama-biden_in_ong.html\">running ads against him recently</a>. </p> <p>That's not the main reason why Carey doesn't like Obama. There are many, foremost among them his redistributive tax policy. But his issues with the Democratic nominee go beyond the political to the philosophical. Carey, who has a well-paid job for a lumber firm in Rocky Mount, believes that government intrudes in the natural order of things. People should protect themselves, support themselves and take care of themselves. </p> <p>Well-read and well-travelled Carey doesn't suit the liberal stereotype of a gun nut, let alone a redneck. His adherence to rugged individualism suits him quite well because he is quite a rugged individual. He built his own barn, clears his own land (he owns a few acres) and is in the process of making a lake. He works hard and seems proud of the fact that he only takes one week vacation a year. </p> <p>He describes himself as conservative, not Republican. He is deeply disappointed in George Bush's last term, citing his failure to secure the border from illegal immigrants and his failed nomination of Harriet Miers as two particular low points. He's backing McCain as the lesser of two evils but Democrat, Mark Warner, for Senate because he did such a good job as governor.</p> <p>As the sun went down, we took a short tour of his land and then headed home for dinner with his wife, who is also named Carey, and is deeply religious and more conservative than he is, according to her husband. Mrs Garst listens to the public radio station NPR on her way to work in the morning and conservative talk radio on her way back. She likes Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. But neither of them spend much time on the internet scooping up rumours only to regurgitate them as fact.</p> <p>Over wine, we talked health care and taxes and they both despaired at the prospect of an Obama administration. Given that he's such a disaster, I asked why they thought he was doing so well in Virginia. After a moment of reflection Mrs Garst said she had no idea.</p> <p>\"Why do they support him?\" she asked. \"What do they say?\" I mentioned economy, Iraq and health care as the main three things that keep coming up. She had informed responses as to why Obama would be bad on all of them. But her question itself was telling. </p> <p>An evening with the Garsts lays bare the depths of America's political polarisation. A night out with many liberals could well produce the same confusion about what motivates the other side. The problem is not just that people do not agree with each other. It is that at times they don't even seem to know each other politically beyond caricature. A sizeable section of both the Democratic and Republican base believes that the only reason the other exists is because they are either deluded, bigoted, misinformed, misanthropic, greedy, gullible or godless. Both believe that their information pool is contaminated - one by the liberal media, the other by the mainstream corporate media. The issue is not that there's no middle ground, it's that there's little in the way of common ground.</p>",

With his army of small donors, Barack Obama is <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1008/Spending_by_state.html\">outspending John McCain in most states</a>. Look at the number in Florida: The Obama campaign is spending $2.2 million to the McCain's campaign $659,000. </p> <p>3. <a href=\"http://haussamen.blogspot.com/2008/07/obamas-offices-reveal-focus-on-southern.html\">New Mexico political blogger Heath Haussamen</a> said that Barack Obama has 40 local campaign offices around the state compared to John McCain's 10.

I would make no such projections. I do think it's interesting though that one of the country's most important conservative journalist/intellectuals is doing it. And I thought you should know! It may start a drip, drip, drip.</p> <p>Oh yes, Brooks also said this:</p> <blockquote> <p>[Sarah Palin] represents a fatal cancer to the Republican party. When I first started in journalism, I worked at the National Review for Bill Buckley. And Buckley famously said he'd rather be ruled by the first 2,000 names in the Boston phone book than by the Harvard faculty. But he didn't think those were the only two options. He thought it was important to have people on the conservative side who celebrated ideas, who celebrated learning. And his whole life was based on that, and that was also true for a lot of the other conservatives in the Reagan era. Reagan had an immense faith in the power of ideas. But there has been a counter, more populist tradition, which is not only to scorn liberal ideas but to scorn ideas entirely. And I'm afraid that Sarah Palin has those prejudices. I think President Bush has those prejudices.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yowza.<br></p>",
  "<p>A Republican economist and adviser to John McCain said today that the current economic downturn could last longer than the previous four recessions, a gloomy view for a campaign that hopes to turn the national conversation away from the economy in the remaining weeks of the presidential race.</p> <p>Martin Feldstein, a Harvard University economist who advised presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr, this afternoon blamed a continuing decline in house prices for the dire situation. He said the $700bn economic rescue package passed last week by the US Congress fails to sufficiently address problems in the housing market.</p> <p>\"Home prices still have some distance to fall just to get back to the pre-bubble level,\" Feldstein said on Bloomberg television. \"The danger is that it'll just keep going, as individuals default on mortgages and that leads to foreclosures, and the foreclosures add to the stock of unsold homes\".</p> <p>Feldstein said that 10m homes have negative equity, meaning homeowners owe more on property than it's worth on the market, and those homeowners have an incentive to default on mortgages.</p> <p>He proposed the US government offer to buy portions of mortgages from every homeowner in American, in exchange for a new loan at a lower interest rate. He said that would stop the \"downward spiral\" of house prices, while giving participating homeowners a lower cost of servicing their mortgages.</p> <p>In a Wall Street Journal article published on Saturday, Feldstein said the plan could cost as much as $1tn, but it would not be comparable to an outlay of that size on government programmes. That is because the homeowners would be required to repay the government-provided loans.</p> <p>As the global economic crisis has worsened, McCain's campaign has faltered while Barack Obama has risen in polls both nationally and in key swing states. Polling indicates voters trust Obama more than McCain to manage the crisis.</p> <p>The McCain campaign has sought to turn voters' attention from the economy and onto Obama's character, for example by pointing to his association in Chicago with a 1960s-era radical who was part of a violent anti-Vietnam war protest organisation. </p> <p>Perhaps sensing that tack had failed to gain traction, in last night's debate McCain proposed a $300bn plan under which the US government would purchase mortgages from troubled homeowners and replace them with more affordable loans. The Obama campaign maintains that the US treasury department already has that authority under the rescue plan passed last week.</p>",
  "<p>Just because McCain didn't get to mention Ayers last night doesn't mean of course that the subject is dropped. See <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/mccain-release-on-ayers/\">this</a> for example. Look, I hate the Weathermen too, but really, Obama was nine years old when this happened. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Michael Scherer at Time <a href=\"http://www.time-blog.com/swampland/2008/10/is_john_mccain_supported_by_te.html\">revealed today</a> that McCain himself is a terrorist-symp by his own admission:</p> <blockquote> <p>This morning John McCain put out a list of 100 former ambassadors who are supporting his campaign. Number two is Leonore Annenberg, the wife of Ambassador William Annenberg, the founder of the Annenberg Institute of Reform, which funded the Annenberg Challenge, which once had two famous board members: former \"domestic terrorist\" William Ayers and Sen. Barack Obama.</p> <p>So either we should all be outraged that John McCain is supported by a family who funded a foundation that hired a domestic terrorist, or this whole William Ayers thing is just plain silly. I choose the latter.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Annenbergs, if you don't know, are a famous American publishing family, very Republican going back generations. They got their start in newspapers in the days when big cities had a dozen or 15 competing dailies and papers literally hired thugs to rough up and occasionally kill corner newsboys so as to claim space on more profitable street corners. </p> <p>Anyway, JM and Embarracuda are obviously going to keep after this. Even Republicans in my reading tend to think it won't \"alter the dynamic,\" as they say, but we'll need four or so days to see that for sure.<br></p>",
  "<p>John McCain narrowed the focus of his campaign today after failing to deliver the game-changing performance he needed in his presidential debate against Barack Obama. With instant polls awarding the debate to Obama, McCain's advisers refocused the campaign on a narrow field of battleground states. That suggests a best-case scenario for the Republican of a very slim victory over Obama.</p> <p>The McCain camp also signalled an attempt to return to a more issues-based campaign, focused on the economy, only days after announcing a \"gloves off\" attack on Obama's character and his former associations in Chicago.</p> <p>Speaking after Tuesday's televised debate in Nashville, Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, set out a narrow strategy that allows little room for manoeuvre. The Republicans' hopes now rest on holding on to the states that President George Bush won in 2004 and on taking Pennsylvania from the Democrats. The state, with its 21 electoral votes, would push him over the 270 college votes needed to win.</p> <p>Obama, in contrast, is in a position to expand his playing field, and is buying television advertising and making campaign appearances in traditional Republican states such as Indiana and North Carolina.</p> <p>At a rally in Indianapolis, the Democrat pushed back hard against McCain's attempt to relaunch his campaign on healthcare and the economy, telling people not to be \"bamboozled\". He reminded the crowd that McCain had only a day or two earlier been fighting the election on issues of character. \"The McCain campaign actually said, and I am quoting, 'if we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose'.\"</p> <p>McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, headed straight from Nashville for a joint rally in the Pennsylvania steel town of Bethlehem. McCain is to push his plan, unexpectedly announced during the debate, for a $300bn government programme to help homeowners facing the loss of their homes.</p> <p>The problem for McCain is that polls show that voters in Pennsylvania, as in other states, have shifted to Obama in droves in the past fortnight as a result of the economic crisis. The RealClearPolitics website, which keeps a running tally of polls, put Obama on 51% in Pennsylvania against McCain on 39%.</p> <p>McCain also faces a financial gap against Obama. After accepting public finance, he is restricted to spending $84m on the election, while Obama, who has broken all previous fundraising records, can raise funds and spend without limit.</p> <p>Obama so far has spent $6m more a week on TV advertising, according to Ken Goldstein, a University of Wisconsin professor who monitors campaign advertising. The Democrats plan to increase their ad buy by 20% a week.</p> <p>Obama is outspending McCain in such key battlegrounds as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida, as well as traditionally Republican territory such as North Carolina and Indiana.</p> <p>McCain has one major opportunity left to try to overcome those disadvantages in the last of the three presidential debates, in New York next Wednesday.</p> <p>In an acknowledgment that McCain's performance on Tuesday night had failed to shift the public focus on the economy, one of his key advisers, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, accused the moderator, Tom Brokaw, of hijacking the debate's format.</p> <p>A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll taken immediately after the debate awarded it to Obama by a margin of 54% to 30%, with the rest giving it as a tie.</p> <p>The age gap between the two men - Obama is 47, McCain 72 - has seldom been as obvious. When asked during the debate how the economic crisis would affect the three top priorities of his administration, McCain appeared unable to remember what they were and jotted down a note.</p>",
  "<p>Is it \"the one\" or \"that one\"? It depends on John McCain's mood. The Republican apparently believes both designations are equally appropriate for his Democratic opponent, Barack Obama.</p> <p>In an exchange on energy in Tuesday night's debate, McCain referred to Obama as \"that one\". The Democrats immediately claimed the comment as evidence of McCain's disdain for his opponent.</p> <p>In the spin alley after the debate, Obama aides laboured strenuously to make the case that McCain's use of the words \"that one\" exposed the Republican candidate as angry and erratic and - not so subtly - old.</p> <p>McCain's utterance made much less impact on television viewers than on spin doctors. The alleged dissing of Obama did not gain much traction yesterday,</p> <p>And it turns out McCain is equally at home with calling Obama \"the one\" - a reference Republicans believe shows up the Democrats' messianic pretensions.</p> <p>The Republican campaign on Tuesday handed out an unusual gift to reporters on McCain's press plane: cufflinks with a faux presidential seal - a reference to Obama's embarrassing use of White House imagery this year.</p> <p>Engraved on the back of the cuff links were the words \"The One\".<br></p>",

  "<p>John McCain used last night's debate to tout a new \"<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/10/07/mccain-announces-homeownership-resurgence-plan/\">Homeownership Resurgence Plan</a>\", which would empower the US treasury department to buy up troubled mortgages outright and replace them with fixed-rate loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The Republican candidate claimed total responsibility for the idea, telling the nation that his plan was \"not Senator Obama's proposal, it's not President Bush's proposal\". </p> <p>Of course, as the Obama camp and Dow Jones MarketWatch <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/mccains-bold-new-mortgage-plan/story.aspx?guid=%7B6233F720-ADBD-49CC-AFD0-52407D80822D%7D&amp;dist=msr_1\">promptly pointed out</a> this morning, that mortgage-purchasing authority is already included in the $700bn financial rescue plan that both Obama and McCain supported.</p> <p>McCain also might have looked at his past position on relieving homeowners of \"negative equity\" -- he would have noticed that his economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, dismissed the idea in March (just after the implosion of Bear Stearns).</p> <p>Here's Holtz-Eakin, when asked during a press conference about government purchasing of home loans:</p> <blockquote> <p>Senator Clinton seemed to hint at that with a broad FHA authority to buy any loan that's underwater without asking the question why, and that's a mistake. ... And in providing any assistance, it should be the case that everyone has some skin in the game, so the household ends up with some equity interests so they don't walk away, you can't just guarantee a loan with zero equity, and you want to make sure that all parties are making some sacrifice in order to merit the receipt of taxpayer dollars.</p> </blockquote> <p>Holtz-Eakin did outline one principle that has remained constant: under McCain's plan, no homeowner who took out a no-money-down mortgage should get aid. This might be a problem, however, given that the FHA is already insuring large amounts of no-money-down mortgages right now. More than 66,000 of the mortgages backed by the government in the first half of this year, or 36.7%, were \"seller-funded\" (as opposed to funded by the home buyer), <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24580917/\">according to Forbes</a>.</p>",

It begins, as usual, with Disapproving-Voice Man asking \"Who <em>is</em> Barack Obama?\", and revisits the McCainiacs' \"how\" leitmotif with the phrase \"How extreme!\" That latter judgment is based on <a href=\"http://nj.nationaljournal.com/voteratings/\">a calculation</a> by the magazine National Journal, according to which Obama was the Senate's \"most liberal\" member in 2007. A clip of Obama saying \"folks are lying\" is then repeated several times in quick succession. One small problem with this is that the National Journal <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/conventions/co_20080825_4458.php\">actually praised</a> Obama's critique of its ranking methodology; a bigger problem -- who'd have guessed it? -- is that the \"folks are lying\" quote isn't taken from Obama's response to the National Journal ranking at all. (It actually comes from his <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/obama_and_infanticide.html\">response</a> to the National Right To Life Committee over \"born-alive infant\" laws in Illinois.) Hammering Obama as a liberal makes obvious tactical sense, but devoting so much of the ad to his (purported) response to the National Journal is baffling. Or does the McCain campaign imagine numerous conversations across the country going roughly like this: \"You know, honey, I've been thinking some more about who to vote for. We're hurting financially, and I think Obama would do a better job of rescuing the economy, but I admire McCain because he served his country, and I... wait a minute, <em>what?</em> Obama questioned the judgment of a highly respected but relatively small circulation inside-the-Beltway publication aimed at Capitol Hill staffers, think-tank employees, members of Congress and various other DC-based policy wonks? That's it: McCain/Palin gets my vote. I was willing to give Obama the benefit of the doubt on Bill Ayers, Tony Rezko and Jeremiah Wright, but <em>questioning the judgment of the National Journal?</em> That's just un-American.\"<br></p>",
  "<p>How bad was it for John McCain in his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/08/uselections2008.johnmccain1\">second debate</a> with Barack Obama? Bad enough that conservative pundits today are making excuses and pointing fingers at the economy, at the format and, most strikingly, at McCain himself.</p> <p>Despite a conventionally conservative record on such issues as tax cuts for the wealthy (for), abortion rights (against) and military aggression (oh, God, yes), McCain has never been a favourite with the Republican party's right wing. His occasional apostasies on such matters as immigration, judicial appointments and campaign-finance reform, after all, are what have fuelled his \"maverick\" image.</p> <p>But after McCain wrapped up the nomination last spring, and especially after he chose religious-right icon Sarah Palin as his running mate, grumbling among conservatives all but ceased - until now.</p> <p>\"We have a disaster here - which is what you should expect when you delegate a non-conservative to make the conservative (nay, the American) case,\" <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MmFkOTk5MTNhZjVjMmYzYzhlY2RiYmQzN2Y3ZGZjMTg=\">writes Andy McCarthy at National Review</a>.</p> <p>And Michelle Malkin, who just days ago <a href=\"http://michellemalkin.com/2008/10/02/sarah-rocks/\">waxed so enthusiastically over Palin's debate performance</a> against Joe Biden that she could hardly contain herself, is now furious with McCain for his half-baked proposal to bail out homeowners who can't pay their mortgages.</p> <p>\"If Obama had proposed this, the right would be screaming bloody murder about this socialist grab to have the Treasury department renegotiate individual home loans and become chief principal write-down agents for the nation,\" <a href=\"http://michellemalkin.com/2008/10/07/mccain-wants-to-spend-300-billion-more-to-buy-up-bad-mortgages/\">Malkin says</a>.</p> <p>No doubt today is the high-water mark for Obama and the Democratic party. The <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/07/who-won-the-debate-insta_n_132827.html\">polls following last night's debate</a> and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/general_election_mccain_vs_obama-225.html\">in general</a> have turned solidly his way.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081008/ap_on_bi_ge/financial_meltdown;_ylt=AiHRAviMIu73Jndy8PH.zois0NUE\">economy continues to crumble</a>, which is deadly to the party in power. \"I suspect that, whatever the quality of McCain's debate performance, he's going to take the fall for the economy,\" <a href=\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives2/2008/10/021718.php\">writes Paul Mirengoff</a> at the conservative Power Line blog.</p> <p>The campaign can't get any of the atmospherics right, either, from <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/06/AR2008100602935.html\">racist rants at a Palin rally</a> in Florida to McCain's disrespectfully referring to Obama as <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/services/content/news/stories/2008/10/08/mccain_that_one.html?cxtype=rss&amp;cxsvc=7&amp;cxcat=15\">\"that one\"</a> last night.</p> <p>In all likelihood, the race will tighten. But today is not a happy day for the McCain-Palin ticket's cheerleaders.</p> <p>At the Weekly Standard, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/671vtecy.asp\">Fred Barnes blames it all on moderator Tom Brokaw</a>. Granted, an ordinary viewer might take issue with Brokaw's sour obsession with the clock. Barnes, though, sees something more sinister - \"questions that reflected what interests an East Coast newsman\" rather than such heartland standbys as \"abortion, immigration, moral values, same sex marriage, guns, their role models, their view of the presidency or their religious faith.\"</p> <p>Ah, yes. If only we could have more talk about gay marriage, which both Obama and McCain oppose, the Republicans could pick themselves up off the mat and get back into it.</p> <p>The real problem, as my Northeastern University colleague <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/arena/perm/Alan_Schroeder_C3CCF20E-3E0A-46B7-A5AC-C275269955C9.html\">Alan Schroeder observes at the Politico</a>, was that \"the campaigns negotiated rules that placed candidate protection over the public interest\" - resulting in a \"stilted\" presentation rather than a free-wheeling discussion.</p> <p>The townhall format was supposed to play to McCain's strengths, and perhaps it would have if the campaigns had taken Schroeder's advice. (Or perhaps not. It was, after all, at a townhall where McCain memorably broke into a chorus of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-zoPgv_nYg\">\"Bomb, Bomb Iran\"</a>.)</p> <p>Visually, though, it was a disaster for McCain. The contrast between Obama, relaxed and conversational, and McCain, stiff and bristling, did not favour McCain. Back at National Review, <a href=\"http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=M2JkZWYwMjJlYzY3N2FiNzY4YWI1NjcyOWNkOTk3NTQ=\">John Pitney Jr blames it on the North Vietnamese</a>.</p> <p>\"Because of what happened to him in Vietnam, he limps and has difficulty moving his arms,\" Pitney writes. \"These limitations became obvious when he walked around the debate floor. In a just world, television viewers would watch him and think 'war hero'. In the real world, many probably thought 'elderly man'.\"</p> <p>Pitney is not wrong about that. But it was the lack of any real connection with the audience that hurt McCain more than his physical limitations. Neither Obama nor McCain can <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/news/index.html?Releases/2004/Aug04/r080604\">feel people's pain the way Bill Clinton did</a>. But Obama, even while sticking to his professorial demeanour, did a better job of establishing his empathy credentials than McCain, especially when he talked about <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-na-debateside8-2008oct08,0,4755608.story\">his mother's battle with insurance companies</a> while she was dying of cancer.</p> <p>Not that anyone should get carried away with the fallout from one debate, least of all Obama and McCain partisans. In fact, they were both pretty good. Not since the <a href=\"http://www.debates.org/pages/his_1996.html\">1996 debates between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole</a> have we had two candidates who can talk fluidly and in some depth about their policies. The contrast between McCain and the two George Bushes is especially striking.</p> <p>But Obama is consistently getting the better of McCain, and he's doing so at a time when he's already well ahead in the polls. There's really nothing left for McCain and Palin to do other than intensify their negative attacks in what <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/opinion/08wed1.html?partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink\">the New York Times editorial page rightly calls</a> \"one of the most appalling campaigns we can remember\".</p>",
  "<p>The 20-year-old son of a local Democratic politician in Tennessee was indicted today for hacking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin's</a> e-mail account and posting the Republican vice-presidential nominee's personal information online.</p> <p>David Kernell, the son of Democratic state legislator Mike Kernell, faces five years in prison and a $250,000 (\u00a3144,150) fine for breaking into Palin's private Yahoo account last month by resetting her password.</p> <p>The younger Kernell, an economics major at the University of Tennessee, allegedly copied the Alaska governor's e-mails as well as her contact directory, including the private addresses of family members, before posting the information online on September 16. </p> <p>The hack set off a torrent of publicity in the US, some of it focussing on e-mails that appeared to show Palin conducting official business on her Yahoo account \u2013 a possible violation of public records rules. </p> <p>The campaign of Palin's running mate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>, condemned the hack as a \"shocking invasion of the governor's privacy\".</p> <p>The FBI promptly began investigating the break-in, and federal agents searched David Kernell's college dormitory days after the incident. Mike Kernell, the government operations chairman of the Tennessee state legislature, has denied any involvement in the hacking.</p> <p>According to the government indictment of Kernell, he guessed the answers to Yahoo's personal security questions by researching facts about Palin's life. He was then able to reset the Republican's password to \"popcorn\" and freely access her account.</p> <p>In an online post signed by \"rubico\" that claimed responsibility for the break-in, the Palin hacker expressed dismay that nothing more embarrassing was found among her e-mails. </p> <p>\"I read though the e-mails ... ALL OF THEM ... before I posted, and what I concluded was anticlimactic, there was nothing there, nothing incriminating, nothing that would derail her campaign as I had hoped,\" the hacker wrote. </p> <p>Kernell typically uses the \"rubico\" alias, according to US government investigators.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday October 9 2008. We had previously said David Kernell was a student at the University of Knoxville. He is, in fact, a student at the University of Tennessee's Knoxville campus. This has been corrected.</p>",

In fact, as the clip below establishes, the two men did shake hands and embrace a little earlier, in a surprisingly mutually friendly fashion, given McCain's general irritability yesterday.

  "<p>Landay, Strobel and Youssef <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/227/story/53605.html\">strike again</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>WASHINGTON \u2014 A nearly completed high-level U.S. intelligence analysis warns that unresolved ethnic and sectarian tensions in Iraq could unleash a new wave of violence, potentially reversing the major security and political gains achieved over the last year. </p> <p>U.S. officials familiar with the new National Intelligence Estimate said they were unsure when the top-secret report would be completed and whether it would be published before the Nov. 4 presidential election...</p> <p>...The new NIE, which reflects the consensus of all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies, has significant implications for Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama, whose differences over the Iraq war are a major issue in the presidential campaign.</p> <p>The findings seem to cast doubts on McCain's frequent assertions that the United States is \"on a path to victory\" in Iraq by underscoring the deep uncertainties of the situation despite the 30,000-strong U.S. troop surge for which he was the leading congressional advocate.</p> <p>But McCain could also use the findings to try to strengthen his argument for keeping U.S. troops in Iraq until conditions stabilize.</p> <p>For Obama, the report raises questions about whether he could fulfill his pledge to withdraw most of the remaining 152,000 U.S. troops _ he would leave some there to deal with al Qaida and to protect U.S. diplomats and civilians _ within 16 months of taking office so that more U.S. forces could be sent to battle the growing Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan...</p> <p>...U.S. officials say last year's surge of 30,000 troops, all of whom have been withdrawn, was just one reason for the improvements. Other factors include the truce declared by anti-U.S. cleric Muqtada al Sadr, the leader of an Iran-backed Shiite Muslim militia; and the enlistment of former Sunni insurgents in Awakening groups created by the U.S. military to fight al Qaida in Iraq and other extremists.</p> <p>The draft NIE, however, warns that the improvements in security and political progress, like the recent passage of a provincial election law, are threatened by lingering disputes between the majority Shiite Arabs, Sunni Arabs, Kurds and other minorities, the U.S. officials said.</p> <p>Sources of tension identified by the NIE, they said, include a struggle between Sunni Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen for control of the oil-rich northern city of Kirkuk; and the Shiite-led central government's unfulfilled vows to hire former Sunni insurgents who joined Awakening groups.</p> </blockquote> <p>This would seem to benefit Obama slightly more than McCain politically if it comes out before the election, because it would be the official voice of the US government saying that the troop surge was just one of three major factors in the reduction of violence.<br></p>",

Firstly, can we get a <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/how-judo-made-a-man-out-of-hague-707222.html\">match-up with William Hague</a>? And secondly, does Putin have better sporting credentials than any world leader since <a href=\"http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/12295.html\">Alec Douglas-Home</a>?</p> <p>On November 4, the world is going to find out the answer to the question that everyone is asking. Can the blue-collar bubbas of the US actually bring themselves to elect a president who is \u2014 how to put this? \u2014 <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtBBgn0I34E\">this bad at bowling? </a></p> <p>Perhaps wisely, John McCain has steered clear of any such sporting photo ops, though he did reveal a degree of sports-geekiness in his book Faith Of My Fathers, stating that when he was interrogated as a POW he \"gave the names of the Green Bay Packers offensive line, and said they were members of my squadron\". Besides which he can always bask in the reflected glamour that comes from his wife's <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=zN7R7FmOTlU\">drift racing habit</a>. Yes, drift racing. As in The Fast And the Furious 2: Tokyo Drift.</p> <p>Fact is we already have the answer to the bowling question, because as bad as Obama is, he's nothing like <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=uhxQoWHBbaw\">as hopeless as George H W Bush</a>. Obama at least manages to stay on his feet.</p> <p>Actually, Bush Sr and Obama are two of the more accomplished sportsmen to stand for office in recent times. Both of them could at least claim that bowling just isn't their game. Obama <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=j87k1j4CpOw\">sure can shoot hoops</a>, and famously had the nickname Barry O'Bomber for his <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=vYCEnVmNkpE\">jump-shooting skills when he was studying at Punahou High</a>.</p> <p>Bush Sr was a slick-fielding first baseman for Yale University after the second world war, and played in two College World Series. He even captained the team, and was apparently \"a lifetime .354 hitter with two home runs and 23 RBI's in 175 at-bats\" though that sounds suspiciously good to me. Sadly there's no footage of Bush to confirm the stats, but he can be <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=GdCGWlaSKHA\">seen here trying to explain the game to the Queen</a>.</p> <p>Only two post-war presidents had better sporting credentials. <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/5x7eoj\">Gerald Ford was a linebacker for the University of Michigan</a>, and led them through two unbeaten seasons and to a pair of national titles, in 1932 and '33.</p> <p>His predecessor in office, Richard Nixon, was <a href=\"http://nl.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Z8ZwjXpW4\">a football obsessive</a>. He became such good friends with the Washington Redskins coach George Allen that during the 1971 season the president was invited by Allen to call an offensive play during a visit to a practice session at Redskins Park.</p> <p>Nixon called an unusual reverse to the wide receiver. When the Redskins reached the NFC play-offs later that year, they were leading 10-3, and in the final minutes of the first half Allen again called the reverse \u2014 a play he never normally used because he thought it was a \"trick play\" (you couldn't make this up, could you?). It failed, the Redskins lost momentum and then the game, 24-20. Afterwards one Redskins player claimed that Allen had received \"executive orders\" to call the reverse, and while the allegation was never confirmed (or denied) by Allen, many commentators alleged that Nixon did indeed phone the coach with instructions during the first quarter.</p> <p>In his book First Off The Tee, Don Van Natta claims Nixon <a href=\"http://www.beauproductions.com/golfswingsws/richardnixon/\">cheated at golf </a>, throwing the ball out of deep rough on to the fairway. Really though you wonder if the stories are just being shaped to fit the man's legacy. There's certainly considerably less evidence that Nixon was a cad on the course than there is that Bill Clinton was. </p> <p>Clinton is infamous for taking repeated 'Billigans' each time he mishit, claiming each shank was a simple practice swing. Tiger Woods told this story about playing a round the two men played together:</p> <p>\"President Clinton rolls one in the bushes, so then hits another one off the tee ... right in the middle of the fairway, hits a nice little wedge shot up there to about, I don't know, 6-7 feet. I hit a bad pitch, I blasted it by about 12 feet. ... Then all of the sudden, he does one of these,\" Woods gestures picking up a ball, \"It was 6-7 feet and he walked off the green ... So I'm sitting in the cart. He's writing down the numbers, I happen to kind of ...\" Woods leans back as if reading a scorecard over someone's shoulder, \"Woods 4, Clinton 3. Interesting maths.\" With 14 of the last 17 presidents playing golf, Clinton was reputedly driven by a desire not to be seen as the Duffer in Chief.</p> <p>JFK kept a lot of secrets, and his golf habit was certainly one of them. His predecessor, Dwight Eisenhower, spent so much time on the golf course (<a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=K-bRB9ggpIs\">often partnering Bob Hope</a>) that he was accused of wanting to introduce a \"36-hole working week\". Keen to avoid the accusation that he was similarly work-shy, JFK kept quiet about the fact that he was <a href=\"http://beauproductions.com/golfswingsws/kennedy/index.html\">so keen on the game</a> he could get around in under 80. His secret passion was only revealed, according to Van Natta, when \"there were all these rumours about JFK and other extracurricular activities. He was sneaking off doing other things and [spokesman] Pierre Salinger had to tell people, 'No, no, no. He's playing golf.' That was better than the alternative.\"</p> <p>While Michael Moore made <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3p9y_OEAdc\"> a lot of comedy capital out of George W Bush's golf game</a>, Dubya generally prefers to limit his sporting interests to the sidelines and the odd ceremonial first pitch, <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=8jmV3XqBOMU&amp;feature=related\">one</a> or <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=qxDsshpG_Oo\">two</a> attempts to play cricket aside (seems like he was quicker to grasp <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/bush/rugby.asp\">the essentials of rugby</a> when he played it at Harvard).</p> <p>With Ronald Reagan never coming closer to sporting glory than when he hammed it up as <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HvYa9NqKM\">George Gipp in the B-Movie Knute Rockne: All American</a> (if you don't know the story of \"win just one for the Gipper\" then <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHPTdliKmk\">Murdoch from the A-Team will explain it better than I ever could</a>), there's not much to compete with Putin.</p> <p>No, if the US want a president to match-up to Putin on the mat, they'd have to go back to Salem County wrestling champion Abraham Lincoln, whose long reach made him, in his own words, \"the second best wrestler in south Illinois\". Sadly there's no YouTube footage of his famous fight with Jack Armstrong. Shame.</p>",
  "<p>I'm not usually very good at offering free hypothetical advice to Republicans. My heart isn't in it. But for what it's worth, I think it's getting a little late to persuade Americans that Barack Obama likes terrorists.</p> <p>Over at The Corner, several of them seem to genuinely believe that because Obama served on two very mainstream projects with a former domestic terrorist who had long since been welcomed back into Chicago society in no small part because his father was a leading Windy City capitalist means that Obama has terrorist sympathies.</p> <p>I don't doubt that they think this sincerely. </p> <p>Their world view is such that Obama's failure to be abhorred by even being in the same room as Ayers provides a kind of de facto proof that Obama is sanguine about terrorism.</p> <p>But people who aren't conservative ideologues -- i.e., the remaining undecided and persuadable voters who will decide this election -- aren't likely to think this way. They may well be disturbed by the Ayers connection, but they're likely to give it far less weight in their deliberations than ideologues do.</p> <p>The same thing happens on the liberal side. For fairness' sake and for purposes of comparison, I'll call myself a liberal ideologue. I think certain extremely dark thoughts about Sarah Palin. But I don't give voice to them in print, and I don't think Obama and Biden should press them, because I understand that a centrist and non-ideological voter won't share those particular dark thoughts.</p> <p>Lots of liberals were outraged about her book-banning enthusiasm. So am I. But if the Obama people were in my living room asking me how to go after Palin, I'd never recommend that they talk about banned books because I know that only liberals really care about that and we're only about 20% of the country. Attack her, if at all, on her lack of preparedness. That, regular people can relate to.</p> <p>Regular voters are going to be far less worked up about Ayers than right-wingers will. One good scary TV ad can always change things I suppose, but my main point here is that ideologues of either side often make the mistake of thinking that if some issue really has them worked up, then surely it must work up regular voters too. Sometimes but not always.</p> <p>I think McCain would be better off just talking about Obama's lack of experience, without injecting into it anything that could blow back at him in a nasty way. But as I say I'm glad I'm not advising him, for multiple reasons.</p>",

  "<p>The NYT does <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/us/politics/08mortgage.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">a decent job</a> of explaining McCain's mortgage proposal from last night:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Obama camp is correct that the new $700 billion bailout of the financial system gives the Treasury the authority to buy troubled mortgages. But the law leaves unclear how the authority is to be used, according to a person who was privy to the recent legislative negotiations between the White House and Congress and who is not affiliated with either campaign.</p> <p>The mortgage renewal idea actually originated with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, said Charlie Black, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain. And Mrs. Clinton, who proposed the idea in a recent newspaper column, borrowed it from a Depression-era New Deal agency, the Home Owner's Loan Corporation.</p> <p>As Mr. McCain's campaign described his program, it would be available to mortgagors for whom the property is their primary residence, who can prove they were creditworthy when the original loan was made and who made a down payment.</p> </blockquote> <p>So I gather from this that last week's bailout gave Treasury the authority but not necessarily the obligation to negotiate directly with homeowners, while McCain's/Hillary's proposal would oblige Treasury to do so. I guess that sounds mostly all right to me, but if it sounds all right to me, it probably doesn't sound so good to, say, <a href=\"http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=28907\">Newt Gingrich</a>.<br></p>",
  "<p>While most early polls crowned Barack Obama the victor in last night's town hall debate, both campaigns today sought to gain an edge in the post-event spin, releasing statements claiming victory.</p> <p>The debate yielded no obvious result in the Republicans' campaign to reinvigorate John McCain's campaign and boost his poll ratings. However, the Republican party chairman, Mike Duncan, praised McCain's \"commitment and decisiveness\".</p> <p>\"He has shown he can provide solutions to the real issues hardworking American families are dealing with,\" Duncan said.</p> <p>\"While Barack Obama postured for political expedience and contradicted his record, John McCain showed true leadership and initiative.

In a poll of CNN viewers, 54% said Obama won, compared with 30% for McCain.</p> <p>The debate questions focused largely on the economy. A CBS News poll of roughly 500 viewers after the debate showed that 68% thought Obama would make the right decisions on the economy, compared with 54% before. McCain's percentages rose from 41% to 49% after the debate.</p> <p>On CNN today, the Republican strategist Ed Rollins, a veteran of Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign, said: \"John needed to have a big night. He had an OK night. It ended up a draw at best, and that doesn't change the game\".</p> <p>He criticised McCain's introduction, which gave no detail or explanation, of his plan to purchase bad mortgages from homeowners.</p> <p>The candidates today return to the campaign trail, with McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, reuniting for rallies in Pennsylvania and Ohio.</p> <p>In an aggressive move into traditionally Republican territory, Obama is scheduled to hold a rally in Indianapolis, Indiana.</p>",

  "<p>There was a moment on the radio this morning when a BBC reporter asked John Cridland, No 2 at the CBI how well he thought the government had done. </p> <p>\"I can't criticise the government. The pace of events...\" replied Cridland. \"You think the government has done a good job?\" interrupted the reporter, a touch incredulous. </p> <p>Cridland, whose organisation was on the saner side of free market argument in the Thatcher heyday, said the CBI is \"very grateful\" for government support. </p> <p>That's nice because we're all going to have to pay for it one way or another - and it will be a long time before anyone can know whether the remedy has worked to restore confidence in financial markets and beyond.</p> <p>But everyone wants instant answers. \"Banks furious as government dithers\" were headlines in yesterday's papers, this because Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling hadn't come up with the rescue package for the banks which they explicitly said - at the weekend and on Monday - they weren't yet ready to produce. Having listened to officials this morning, explaining the grinding technicalities after being up all night I have some sympathy.</p> <p>Yet , just as today's Daily Mail leads on \"Banks to fall under state control\" - sinister or what? - we heard John Humphrys, the Mail's broadcasting favourite, cajoling Darling on the Today programme about his apparent refusal to take more control of the banks to protect the taxpayers' interests.</p> <p>You just can't win. Damned if you do, damned if you don't, damned if you hurry - like Hank Paulson in the US - damned if you sew up the details - as Darling has tried to do - rather than go off at half-cock.</p> <p>Before addressing MPs at lunchtime the chancellor refused to answer questions he didn't want to answer - quite right too in tricky times when casual words can tumble markets, though it transpires that each negotiation with each bank will be different, depending what they ask for and what assurances - executive pay, share status etc - Whitehall seeks to protect the taxpayer.</p> <p>That all seems reasonable to me. Indeed at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/oct/08/pmqs.gordonbrown\">PM's question time</a> - a rare win in straight sets for Brown - David Cameron and Nick Clegg were falling over themselves to ask largely redundant questions about the need to look after small businesses and mortgage victims, not the bonuses of investment bankers who have failed us all. </p> <p>Easy, populist stuff from Cameron and George Osborne, who were singing more of a John McCain tune a few days ago.</p> <p>But what about that earlier \"banks furious\"? Where did all that stuff come from? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/08/economy.gordonbrown\">Patrick Wintour sets out some of the background in today's Guardian</a>, not least the pressure on Downing Street after City leaks helped push down bank shares and the FTSE in general - though it was part of a global decline on Monday and Tuesday. It seems to have emerged from weekend briefings and meetings between interested parties.</p> <p>Brown blames the Tories for leaking confidential briefings for party advantage. That may or may not be the case. But what triggered Tuesday's market panic was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/ \">Robert Peston's BBC blog</a>, revealing a Monday night meeting where the \"gang of three\" - Barclays, RBS and Lloyds TSB - told Darling to pull his finger out and rescue them fast. </p> <p>That could be a case of briefing against government to increase political pressure, something the City is good at doing against ministers and against commercial rivals. </p> <p>There again, if other banks - less pressed - were present they could have leaked it to damage the gang of three. Who can say? Peston, who is a very good news reporter, has been scaring me for months. \"He behaves like a print journalist,\" complains a tabloid colleague. </p> <p>Exactly, but the BBC is not a tabloid and the impact of its bulletins - and blogs - is exponential in a febrile public mood where City rumours easily go mad. </p> <p>The BBC bureaucracy is hopeless - think Andrew Gilligan - at managing the output of talented and energetic mavericks. </p> <p>The Mail is now on Robert Peston's case, so the suits may finally notice. Yet the temptation is always to hit the easy target - governments. Even so sophisticated a conservative commentator as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/08/economy.alistairdarling\">Simon Jenkins falls into this trap today</a>.</p> <p>So repeat after me: the bankers took the bumpers and the airbags out of the car to make it go faster. They then took it for a spin after a good lunch, drove too fast round some wet corners and crashed. They're in the wreckage screaming for help and blaming the fire brigade for not cutting them out sooner. They know the petrol tank may blow at any moment. In that situation it might be wise to extinguish that comforting cigar.</p>",

  "<p>Republican candidates don't like town hall-style debates, especially not during times of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">economic turmoil</a>. To get an idea of why this is the case, think back to the first such presidential debate back in 1992, when <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/gb41.html\">President George HW Bush</a> was looking at his watch and filing toward the exit.</p> <p>Back then, a woman got up to ask a question about the recession, which she confused with the national debt. \"How has the national debt affected each of your lives?\" she asked the three candidates. \"How can you honestly find a cure for the economic problems of the common people, if you have no experience in what's ailing them?\"</p> <p>Bush hemmed and hawed defensively, saying that you don't have to have cancer in order to understand it. Bill Clinton got up and handled the question masterfully, empathising with the woman's economic anxieties and fixing the blame squarely on Republican \"trickled-down\" policies.</p> <p>Then came the Ponytail Guy, who rose to ask Bush, Clinton, and Ross Perot, \"How can we, as symbolically the children of the future president, expect ... you to meet our needs, the needs in housing and in crime and you name it?'\"</p> <p>Questioner after questioner gets up to ask something of the government \u2013 a new spending programme, a policy that will provide some benefit or right some personal misfortune. The Republican candidate is left to try to patiently explain why the government can't give what the voter is asking for, leaving the Democrat to tell the audience what it wants to <br>hear. If the Republican tries to adjust, he will either simply say: \"Me too,\" or promise to do all of the same things while spending less money.</p> <p>It's not a winning combination. But there have been exceptions. You can never guarantee that the town hall audience will follow the script and ask predictable questions. George W Bush performed well in this format, in no small part because there were conservative-leaning voters in the crowd directing pointed questions toward John Kerry.</p> <p>John McCain, with his gift of gab, has thrived in town hall meetings. So much so, in fact, that he <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/06/04/mccain_challenges_obama_to_10.html\">proposed a series of such exchanges</a> over the summer after the two major-party nominees were selected. The honey-tongued Barack Obama demurred, preferring the more traditional debate formats.</p> <p>Following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/08/uselections2008.johnmccain1\">last night's debate</a>, it's now hard to see why Obama didn't call McCain's bluff. To be sure, McCain got his licks in and Obama didn't dominate the way he might have in a formal speechmaking contest. But for all of McCain's skills in schmoozing with swing voters, the disadvantages Republicans have in town halls when times are tough \u2013 especially when the Republican candidate has no coherent economic philosophy \u2013 was painfully evident.</p> <p>Obama hit McCain on his vote against expanding the <a href=\"http://www.cms.hhs.gov/LowCostHealthInsFamChild/\">state children's health insurance programme</a>. McCain had no response. He attacked McCain's plan to let people buy health insurance across state lines, and McCain didn't respond \u2013 even when he obviously could have asked Obama if he wanted to repeal the banking regulations that have made his running mate's state of Delaware a banking hub. Obama even (absurdly) charged that McCain believed in \"deregulation in every circumstance. That's what we've been going through for the last eight years.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.soxlaw.com/\">Sarbanes-Oxley</a>, anyone? <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisan_Campaign_Reform_Act\">McCain-Feingold</a>? McCain is a regulator par excellence, who wants greater federal oversight of professional sports. McCain's response? The sound of crickets chirping.</p> <p>When Obama promised to cut taxes for 95% of taxpayers and only boost levies on those making more than $250,000 a year, McCain could have countered that Bill Clinton made the very same promise in 1992 and it didn't happen. Did he do it? Not really.</p> <p>Instead McCain once again accused Obama of not following Teddy Roosevelt's dictum, \"Speak softly and carry a big stick.\" In doing so, he walked right into Obama's haymaker about \"Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb Iran,\" for the second time in as many debates.</p> <p>McCain was unable to be gracious, at one point calling the Democratic senator from Illinois \"that one\" and including obscure zingers about Obama's earmark requests. And when asked whether healthcare was a right, Obama was able to easily say yes while McCain called it a responsibility \u2013 and then basically called for the federal government to guarantee affordable healthcare.</p> <p>When it came time to talk about entitlements, Obama had nothing meaningful to say and gave no indication he would deal with the looming crisis. But the Straight Talk Express wasn't much better, promising yet another bipartisan commission that will either raise taxes or do nothing.</p> <p>As Bill Clinton might put it, town hall debates focus like a laser beam on economics. This year, it's the economy, stupid, once again. And McCain wants to turn the GOP into the Stupid Party.</p>",
  "<p>Senior allies of the toppled South African president, Thabo Mbeki, today laid the ground for a breakaway party from the ruling African National Congress because they said its leaders have abandoned the movement's founding principles and put \"our national democracy is in danger\".</p> <p>Mosiuoa Lekota - a former political prisoner on Robben Island, the ANC chairman for a decade and defence minister for 12 years until he resigned after the new party leadership under Jacob Zuma removed Mbeki as president last month - said he and other disillusioned officials will hold a consultative conference within the party that would seem to \"be leading logically\" to a \"divorce\".</p> <p>\"This is probably the parting of the ways,\" he said.</p> <p>Lekota was flanked by the former deputy defence minister, Mluleki George, but did not name any other senior ANC officials as backing the move. However, he said there are significant numbers of rank-and-file members who oppose the existing leadership. </p> <p>Any new political party will face a formidable challenge to take support from the ANC despite growing disillusionment among ordinary voters, particularly a party led by the people who have governed for the past eight years. But the bitterness of Lekota's attack on the leadership that toppled Mbeki from the top of the ANC last year and then as South Africa's president reflects the deep schisms within the ruling party that could see other breakaway factions, particularly on the left over economic policy.</p> <p>Kgalema Motlanthe, the ANC's deputy leader, was appointed interim president after Mbeki was ousted but, for now at least, the party intends to make Zuma its candidate at next year's presidential election.</p> <p>Lekota accused the new leadership of hijacking the ANC and \"eliminating our internal democracy\" in order to make Zuma president and to stop him facing trial on corruption charges. </p> <p>\"There has been elevated to national importance interests of individuals rather than the interests of our country. Every meeting, every public appearance, is about how some individual or the other must be made president of South Africa as if the presidency of South Africa is something hereditary,\" he said. </p> <p>The former ANC chairman said that the new party leadership was also betraying the ANC's Freedom Charter, which formed the basis of the liberation struggle, by demanding that there be a \"political solution\" to prevent Zuma facing trial for corruption which could see him sent to prison for years. </p> <p>\"South Africans are getting arrested from time to time. They have to appear before the courts and they have to bring evidence to prove that they are innocent or not. Now we are saying, no, in a particular case - of the state versus the president of the ANC - there must be a political solution. What has happened to the clause in the Freedom Charter: all shall be equal before the law? If one deviates from that clause are we then going to have a political solution for each and every criminal case that arises in this nation or is it only for this particular individual?\" said Lekota.</p> <p>Lekota also said that the Zuma camp had introduced tribalism into the party's internal politics with a campaign projecting Zuma as a \"100% Zulu boy\" and promoted violence with the singing of a song, Bring Me My Machine Gun, that is now a trademark of the ANC leader.</p> <p>\"T-shirts are printed with tribalist slogans decorated with the face of some very senior member of the ANC. At its foundation the ANC's leaders declared that tribalism is the most serious danger to our country and our people. No condemnation, no action to stop it,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Songs which advocate violence at a time when the ANC has negotiated peace for this country, and our people are supposed to be free and live in peace, leaders of the ANC stand on public platforms singing songs that advocate violence and the collection of weapons. To what end? To promote what policy of the ANC?\"</p> <p>But Lekota's accusation that the new ANC leadership is \"eliminating internal democracy\" with a purge of Mbeki's supporters and attacks on Zuma's critics will ring hollow among many of Mbeki's critics who were hounded with a vicious vilification campaign by the former president's backers. </p> <p>Lekota declined to say directly that he will be launching a new party but, when pressed on the issue by reporters, he said that today's announcement amounted to the serving of \"divorce papers\".</p>",
  "<p>It was a low-key debate, in the end, but that doesn't mean it wasn't pivotal. Last night in Nashville, Tennessee, John McCain needed to stage a comeback, turning the election into a referendum on Barack Obama's character. He didn't, and for once, pundits and instant-reaction polls seemed to agree: Obama won the night. </p> <p>McCain seemed uncomfortable, jumping up from his high chair to march towards the audience, rambling in his answers, and sometimes forgetful, Ewen Macaskill and Suzanne Goldenberg write in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/08/uselections2008.johnmccain1\">today's Guardian</a>. </p> <p>At one point, he referred to Obama, with a dismissive hand gesture, as \"that one\" - a reference that caused some in the audience to wince, and that seemed likely to go down as the debate's most memorable moment.</p> <p>The downbeat mood arose, of course, from the economic crisis, and was exacerbated by the enforced silence of the audience at the \"town hall-style\" event, in which the questions came from pre-selected uncommitted voters, and from submissions via the internet. </p> <p>\"Neither candidate was selling morning in America,\" wrote Frank Bruni in the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/us/politics/08assess.html \">New York Times</a>. \"At times it seemed more like a competition to see who could paint the gloaming in the least unsettling hues.\"</p> <p>The big, newsmaking gambit of McCain's performance was his proposal that the government buy up $300bn in bad mortgages. The reaction to think about here is on the right, which will see this as a second bailout, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/08/johnmccain.barackobama?commentpage=1\">argues Michael Tomasky</a> on Comment Is Free today. </p> <p>McCain steered clear of the personal negativity we've heard Sarah Palin deploy in the last few days: Bill Ayers, for example, went completely unmentioned. Obama's performance on foreign policy, meanwhile, was notable for its sharpness: the Democrat directly addressed McCain's suggestion that Obama was inexperienced while he, McCain, was \"sombre and responsible\". </p> <p>\"This is the guy who sang 'bomb bomb bomb Iran',\" Obama retorted. \"Who called for the annihilation of North Korea ... This is the guy who after we had \u2013 we hadn't even finished Afghanistan -- he said, 'next up, Baghdad'.\"</p> <p>Over the last few weeks, \"game-changer\" has been the favourite phrase of the pundits, as they diagnose what the Republicans need in this election race. But last night in Nashville McCain didn't achieve one, and it's not entirely clear now how he can.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>McCain and Palin hold joint rallies in Pennsylvania and Ohio today; Obama is in Indiana. And to coincide with the post-debate analysis, it's a big night on the evening talk shows: McCain and Palin will appear jointly on Fox News, and Palin will do a separate solo Fox interview, while Michelle Obama is on CNN's Larry King Live and the Daily Show with Jon Stewart.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/10/07/politics/horserace/entry4508356.shtml\">snap CBS poll</a> of uncommitted voters handed the debate to Obama: 40% said he won, 26% said McCain won, and 34% thought it was a draw. CNN's similar poll found 54% of people thought Obama won, compared to 30% for McCain. Gallup's daily tracking poll - not including post-debate data, obviously - puts Obama at 51% and McCain at 42%, a one-point improvement for Obama compared to yesterday.</p> <h2>Quote of the day I</h2> <p>\"You know who voted for it? You might never know. That one. You know who voted against it? Me\" - John McCain, gesticulating but not looking at Barack Obama, recalls how the two men voted on the 2005 Bush energy bill, which McCain described as \"loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies\". Nobody knew quite what to make of \"that one\": some thought it was contemptuous, others suggested it might be heard as having a racial tinge. Then again, maybe it was just weird.</p> <h2>Quote of the day II</h2> <p>\"He's right. There are some things I don't understand. I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11\" - Obama confronts the experience issue. We look forward to the McCain campaign ad that quotes only \"there are some things I don't understand\", followed by that actor they keep using with the disapproving voice: \"How shocking! How dangerous!\"</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/03/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">Obama makes strong showing in Tennessee debate</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/08/barackobama.johnmccain.nashville.debate\">Video: Highlights of Barack Obama and John McCain's second debate</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/08/uselections2008.barackobama\">Tomasky Talk: McCain's gloves stayed on during second debate</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/08/uselections2008.johnmccain\">McCain is heading for defeat, says Republican analyst</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/08/uselections2008.johnmccain\">It's President 'That One' to you</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1848164,00.html\">Time: In Town-Hall Debate, Obama Holds the Ball \u2014 and the Advantage</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/the-winner-of-debate-ii-t_b_132852.html\">Arianna Huffington: The Winner of Debate II? \"That One\"</a></p> <p><a href=\" http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14380.html\">Politico: McCain loses by not winning</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/relatively_dull_debate_combine.php\">Talking Points Memo: Obama Scores Clear Win In Low-Key Debate</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/07/that-one-mccain-calls-oba_n_132802.html\">Huffington Post: Watch McCain call Obama 'That One'</a></p> <h2>Impressively fast graphic design work of the day</h2> <p>Get your \"That One 08\" campaign merchandise... <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/copelanda/2923600786/\">here </a>and <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/stevegarfield/2923763274/\">here <br></a></p>",
  "<p>The first democratic presidential elections in the Indian Ocean islands of the Maldives could see Asia's longest-serving leader ousted by a human rights activist whom he once imprisoned.<br> Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who has been president for the past three decades, faces five rivals in the election, which is the culmination of a peaceful democracy movement that became irresistible after violent riots in 2005.</p> <p>Despite some fears of rigging and threats against political figures earlier this week, the Maldives appeared calm today with a heavy police and military presence. The archipelago of 300,000 people on 1,196 islands is expected to get its new president on Thursday.<br> Gayoom, 71, who has served six terms under a one-candidate system, has pitched himself as the creator of modern-day Maldives. He built an economy on high-end tourism, with resorts overlooking white sand beaches and crystal clear waters where hotels charge thousands of pounds a night. He claims also to have preserved the island's unique brand of Islam. The president faces a serious threat from the founder of the Maldivian Democratic party (MDP), Mohamed \"Anni\" Nasheed, a former Amnesty International prisoner of conscience. Nasheed, a slight man who walks with a limp from the torture he endured, has been the president's most effective tormentor, attacking the widening gulf between rich and poor and an alarming rise in drug use. The perception, especially in the crowded capital, Male, is that a corrupt elite has profited from the Gayoom presidency.</p> <p>\"We have seen a real groundswell of public support in the last few weeks. The levels of poverty have become a real issue. There is vast wealth only in the top seven per cent of the population. Seventy per cent of the population lives below the poverty line and there is a social breakdown as the gap between rich and poor widens,\" said the MDP's Nasheen Mohammed.<br> There have been signs of a bubbling conflict on the islands. The Maldives suffered its first terror attack last year, with Islamic militants blamed for bombing a park in Male, wounding a dozen tourists. The MDP considers Male its base: Anni Nasheed was elected to the Maldivian parliament in 2000. Gayoom's political constituency is among the 1,000 smaller islands located 800km (500 miles) off the tip of India. In these rural constituencies, Gayoom's message as protector of Islam plays well. The winner will have to garner more than 50% of the votes to avoid a run-off. With no reliable opinion polls, the outcome is seen as impossible to predict. One local newspaper's internet poll put the MDP at 53% to Gayoom's 10%. This was considered a reflection only of web users' preferences. Gayoom has promised to hand over power peacefully if he loses. Last month, the president signed into law a new constitution establishing an independent judiciary and electoral body. It ended the practice of the parliament approving a single candidate who was put forward in a referendum. On this basis, Gayoom was returned to power six times with what he said was more than 90% of the vote. The new president will lose considerable power, with the new 74-member parliament having the right to block cabinet appointments and produce new laws. According to the new constitution, polls to the new parliament have to take place before next March. \"These elections are important but we need elections for the new parliament quickly. It is the body that will be supreme,\" said the MDP's Nasheen Mohammed.</p>",

  "<p>Which comic book characters fight for truth, justice and the American way? Barack Obama and John McCain, of course.</p> <p>Today, two all-American heroes face off in the first issues of their own comic books - US presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. A publishing company best known for comics about vampires and robots has produced graphic novel biographies of the two combatants.</p> <p>Real life characters getting their own comic books is not a new concept, of course, and has been happening ever since cheesy-listening crooner Pat Boone <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/utherworld/comixpix/zllsupesboone.html\">went head-to-head with Superman</a> half a century ago. But will the life stories of Obama and McCain have any interest for an audience reared on teenagers with the proportional strength of spiders or babies shot in rockets from dying planets? And, more importantly, will it get them to vote?</p> <p>In the last US presidential election, there was a voter turnout of 64% (leaving the controversy over the counts aside). Will the two 28-page comics <a href=\"http://www.idwpublishing.com/\">published by IDW today</a> improve on that figure this time round? And is that, in fact, the intention?</p> <p>Not according to Jeff Mariotte, who has written Republican John McCain's life story, his years as a <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/2008/01/28/john-mccain-prisoner-of-war-a-first-person-account.html\">Vietnam prisoner of war</a> and all. He says: \"We're just using the medium to get the stories of these guys out there, maybe for a different audience that wouldn't pick up a big biography of them.\"</p> <p>The graphic novel market has split into two distinct sectors in recent years: the adult, memoir-ish style characterised by Marjane Satrapi's recently-filmed story of growing up in Iran, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/apr/25/animation.drama\">Persepolis</a>, or Robert Crumb's slice-of-life comics, and then there's the traditional, primary-coloured type of story that made the medium what it is today: <a href=\"http://www.superherodb.com/\">the superheroes</a>. </p> <p>IDW's biogs of Obama and McCain have deliberately chosen the second, older form; it would have been easy to appeal to more adult readers with a couple of moody graphic novels tackling McCain's incarceration and Obama's young life as the son of a single mother; instead the comics feature the pair in superhero poses against Old Glory rippling in the wind. Whoever wins this four-colour slugfest wins the right to save the world.</p> <p>Whether the comic books will have any real social value other than as curios for the ardent collector remains to be seen. A regular reader of, say, Iron Man or the Incredible Hulk is unlikely to become a political animal because real world events have been shoehorned into the world that the comics reader is used to inhabiting. And anyone who reads comics will know that many of the authors make a pretty decent fist of incorporating political events - real and imagined - into their narratives. Witness Alan Moore's seminal Watchmen, which will be on everyone's lips when the 1986 comic becomes a blockbuster movie next year.</p> <p>And, just like Pat Boone had no chance of winning against Superman in 1959, real-life characters who cross over to the comics rarely have much success. Anyone remember Marvel Comics' comic about Pope John Paul II in 1983? Or, from 1980, <a href=\"http://www.comics-db.com/comic-book/1092405-Francis_Brother_Of_The_Universe_1.html\">Francis: Brother of the Universe</a>, also a Marvel Comics title, about St Francis of Assisi? Even Ronald Reagan got his own graphic life story last year.</p> <p>It does, of course, beg the question why British politicians have never been given their own comic books. The Iron Lady, anyone? Blair's Babes, fighting injustice wherever they found it? Gordon Brown, in skin-tight Lycra and a billowing cape? Perhaps we'd better just leave this sort of thing to the Americans.</p>",
  "<p>Town hall meetings have been feted as the arena in which <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/06/04/mccain-town-hall/\">John McCain excels</a> and so it was expected that he would breeze through <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/08/uselections2008.johnmccain1\">last night's presidential debate in Nashville</a>. As it turned out, however, McCain's prowess was slightly overrated as Barack Obama proved that he too can fare very well in a town hall environment. </p> <p>On the basis of the dramatic economic events that have taken place since the last time McCain and Obama came face to face, McCain was under the most pressure to impress, in order to <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/111004/Gallup-Daily-9Point-Obama-Lead-Ties-Campaign-High.aspx\">bridge the polling gap</a> that has opened up between himself and his opponent. While he wasn't bad, he certainly wasn't brilliant enough to give him any significant advantage over Obama. <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/07/cnn-poll-obama-won-the-night/\">Post-debate polls</a> are already showing that Obama \u2013 who appeared more composed and collected than McCain and displayed a real sense of knowledge and gravitas \u2013 is well ahead.</p> <p>Considering the different physical setting of the debate \u2013 including the candidates' ability to move around and engage directly with the audience \u2013 Obama's and McCain's stylistic, body language and generational differences were much more obvious tonight, and will no doubt play a much larger role in determining who voters believe won the debate. </p> <p>The ability to connect with voters was important for both candidates and in that respect McCain was physically clearly at ease with the audience. Whilst not quite as folksy as Sarah Palin, he often addressed the audience using the somewhat forced expression \"my friends\" and went to some lengths to repeat the names of the individuals who had asked questions, standing closer to them than Obama and even shaking hands with one. Making McCain appear amiable, this was a tactic that will no doubt go down well with Republican voters.</p> <p>However, McCain's physical closeness was at odds with a disconnect revealed not only by his jokes about needing a hair transplant (which was met with silence) or the obvious disdain directed towards Obama \u2013 who he <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blogs/campaignmatters/369738/not_the_senator_but_that_one\">at one point addressed as \"that one\"</a> \u2013 but also by his statement that members of the audience may never have heard of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac before last week \u2013 highly unlikely considering that they are two of America's largest mortgage providers. </p> <p>Obama, although physically more distant from the audience, did an excellent job at connecting in a more down-to-earth, in touch and less forced way than McCain by making clear references to the experiences of middle class people, and directing his key points on issues back to their specific and practical impact on average Americans. On healthcare, for example, he shared his own experience \u2013 one that is not uncommon in America - of how his mother, dying from cancer had to \"spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies\" over whether they would pay for her treatment.</p> <p>The different standpoints of both candidates were more obvious than ever last night, and they both had different degrees of effectiveness in delivering their take on the issues, with Obama certainly doing better in continuing his effective strategy of <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/is_it_true_john_mccain_voted_with.html\">linking McCain to President Bush</a>, which he did several times, even referring, for example, to \"Senator McCain's and George Bush's foreign policy\" as if they had created it together.</p> <p>McCain's strategy was to focus mainly on talking points, continually bringing the questions back to energy, tax, earmarks and his ability to \"reach across the aisle\". However, with the economy and other such practical issues at the forefront of the minds of American voters, specifics were important tonight. On this aspect, Obama was a clear winner, giving some very solid, well constructed answers on the key points such as healthcare \u2013 which he believes should be a \"right\" for all Americans - Iraq and energy.</p> <p>Anyone who says that Obama is unable to square up to McCain was certainly proven wrong. McCain insisted \u2013 as he has done for some time and as Sarah Palin did in her debate with Joe Biden last week \u2013 on repeating his misrepresentation of Obama's position on taxes. But Obama \u2013 when moderator Tom Brokaw would allow him the opportunity to rebut McCain's points \u2013 fought back, laying out exactly where McCain was incorrect.</p> <p>More vigorously than ever, Obama also delivered some excellent smack-downs to McCain. On McCain's assertions of Obama's apparent naivet\u00e9 he asserted: \"Well, you know, Senator McCain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that I don't understand. It's true. There are some things I don't understand. I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us.\" On McCain's suggestion that Obama is, as Obama himself put it, \"spouting off\", he said: \"[McCain] is the guy who sang, \"Bomb, bomb, bomb Iran,\" who called for the annihilation of North Korea. I don't think that is an example of speaking softly.\"</p> <p>McCain, who repeated the motto \"record over rhetoric\" several times, delivered some optimistic rhetoric of his own, declaring \u2013 somewhat bizarrely - \"I'll get Osama bin Laden, my friends. I'll get him. I know how to get him.\" Of course, he didn't quite divulge how he would do that.</p> <p>Overall, John McCain was not bad, but \u2013 unfortunately for him \u2013 he just wasn't great.</p>",
  "<p>Last night's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/us/politics/08assess.html\">presidential town hall</a> debate in Nashville was beyond infuriating. The Republican candidate said that his plans would amount to \"a net spending cut.\" He promised to go \"line by line through the federal budget\" with a newly sharpened \"scalpel\" and start to cut.</p> <p>The GOP candidate said he would \"favour nuclear power\" as part of a broader scheme for how to supply the country's energy needs while cutting back on foreign oil dependence. He proposed a \"50% tax credit\" to help people purchase healthcare.</p> <p>In foreign affairs, he promised to \"kill bin Laden and ... crush al-Qaida\" by invading Pakistan, if necessary. He said that Russia had \"engaged in evil behaviour\" and pledged to use all possible means to keep Iran from acquiring nukes, including increased sanctions and not-so-veiled threats.</p> <p>Actually, that's a half-lie, or, if you prefer, a half-truth. All of the above quotes were uttered last night, but the speaker was Democratic standard bearer Senator Barack Obama. He and Republican senator John McCain surely have their disagreements but they sounded so alike on that stage last night that it was hard to tell.</p> <p>Perhaps that's because McCain didn't sound like much of a Republican. He actually attacked Herbert Hoover at one point, whose presidency he is almost old enough to remember. \"I'm not too popular sometimes with my own party, much less his,\" McCain said, pointing to Obama.</p> <p>McCain promised to leave tax brackets essentially unchanged and sold his mix of increased income tax deductions for children and tax credits for healthcare as something that would overwhelmingly benefit the poor and working class. Why, McCain said, the only people who would be inconvenienced by his health plan would be those with \"gold plated Cadillac kind of policies.\"</p> <p>Or perhaps it was because Obama didn't sound like much of a liberal Democrat. He promised, a la that titan of triangulation former president Bill Clinton, that he would \"provide a tax cut for 95% of Americans. 95%.\" To help sell his plans to increase state funding of health, he appealed to those \"small business owners, a lot of them, [who] can't even afford health insurance for themselves.\"</p> <p>Some of this was for show, no doubt. McCain is trying to appeal to liberal swing voters. Obama wants to convince more conservative Americans that he won't be so scary as president. This great big bear hug of the middle has left Americans with far fewer options than they deserve.</p> <p>McCain is a conservative warmonger and Obama a liberal interventionist. That means they disagree about Iraq but agree that America ought to be doing more abroad to make the world safe for whatever Americans favour this week. Serious restraint isn't even on the table.</p> <p>Domestically, both candidates voted for the recent massive Wall Street bailout, ignoring progressive and conservative objections to the legislation. Both agree that things are really bad but not so bad that some \"hope\" and \"change\" and that indomitable fighting American spirit can't fix things right up.</p> <p>Who was the victor last night? Obama. Or McCain. It sure wasn't the great nation that one of these men will soon preside over.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338381455\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1842865073_gdn071008presdebate-To-Brightcove-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Barack Obama delivered his strongest ever debate performance on Tuesday night to deny John McCain a comeback in his faltering presidential campaign.</p> <p>McCain, losing ground in the polls as the Republicans bear the brunt of public anger at the economic crisis, needed a game changing moment in the debate. It did not materialise.</p> <p>Instead, Obama did better than expected, delivering crisper and less academic answers than he did in his earlier encounters against Hillary Clinton during the primary campaign. He also made more of an effort to connect emotionally with the experience of ordinary Americans.</p> <p>The town hall debate at Nashville's Belmont University offered a mix of questions from the studio audience and the internet. It produced a more substantive airing of the candidate's views on the economic meltdown and healthcare reform than the first encounter nearly two weeks ago.</p> <p>The format initially was thought to favour McCain's relaxed and humourous style.</p> <p>But the Republican seemed uncomfortable, jumping up from his high chair to march towards the audience, and rambling in his answers. At one point, he referred to Obama as \"that one\" - a reference that caused some women in the audience to wince.</p> <p>The age gap between the two men - McCain is 72 and Obama is 47 - has seldom been as obvious. The Republican, asked how the economic crisis would affect the three top priorities of his administration, appeared unable to remember what they were and jotted down a note.</p> <p>That was a gift to Democrats in the spin room who variously described McCain's performance as \"confused\", \"agitated\" and \"odd\" - all digs at his age.</p> <p>In an acknowledgment that the night had failed to shift the public focus on the economy, or inflict serious damage on Obama, a key McCain adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, accused the moderator, Tom Brokaw, of hijacking the format of the debate.</p> <p>McCain will have another opportunity to reverse his fast-declining political fortunes in a debate in New York state next Wednesday. </p> <p>After a halting start for Obama, the turning point came 20 minutes into the 90-minute encounter when both men were asked by a woman in the audience why anyone should trust either party since both had been responsible for the economic mess. </p> <p>Obama, doing what he failed to do up to that point, personalised the economic discussion by noting that motorists in Nashville were paying $3.80 a gallon to fill up their cars.</p> <p>\"I understand your frustration and your cynicism, because while you've been carrying out your responsibilities - most of the people here, you've got a family budget. If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts. Maybe you don't go out to dinner as much. Maybe you put off buying a new car. That's not what happens in Washington.\"</p> <p>Obama spoke of the importance of spending $15bn a year over 10 years to gain energy independence.</p> <p>The Democrat became most personal when speaking about health reform. He recalled his mother dying of cancer at age of 53 because insurance companies would not pay up, and said that the government has to crack down on them.</p> <p>McCain went even further than Obama to try to forge an emotional bond with the studio audience, offering extravagant praise for their questions. \"You go to the heart of America's worries tonight. Americans are angry, they're upset, and they're a little fearful. It's our job to fix the problem,\" he told a questioner.</p> <p>The Republican was also less formal than Obama in his speaking style. </p> <p>But McCain's efforts to show that he identified with ordinary Americans were undermined by the lack of specificity in his responses. The Republican frequently resorted to material from his stump speeches.</p> <p>Obama, though he too fell back on rehearsed material, offered details and appeared realistic about the tough decisions awaiting the next president. That could sway independent voters who are angry about government spending under George Bush.</p> <p>While McCain insisted that the next president would be able to deal simultaneously with energy, healthcare and social security, Obama admitted there would be stark choices. \"We're going to have to prioritise just like a family has to prioritise,\" he said.</p> <p>The mud-slinging taking place between the two campaigns - in speeches and in ads - was absent from the debate. Aides for both camps said it was not an appropriate setting for those attacks.</p> <p>Yet there were clashes. When McCain reprimanded Obama for talking too loudly in public about his plans to bomb inside Pakistan in the hunt for Osama bin Laden, Obama shot back that McCain had not exactly shown decorum by singing 'bomb, bomb Iran' during a rally in South Carolina last year.</p> <p>Obama, in what appeared to be a well-rehearsed line, also took up McCain's frequent put-down from the first debate in which the Republican candidate accused his rival of \"not understanding\". Obama replied that he understood well enough it had been a mistake to invade Iraq.</p>",
  "<p>Welcome to: Townhall Debate: <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/10/this-is-what-were-dealing-with-shakers.html\">Muslin</a> versus <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/10/this-is-what-were-dealing-with-shakers.html\">Mavrick</a> \u2013 Beyond Thunderdome!</p> <p>Before Barack Obama and John McCain are even introduced, I am struck with wonderment at the staging for the event, which is being held in what appears to be an airtight, windowless bomb shelter gussied up with an ocean of cheap red carpet, a vivid blue wall, one jarringly incongruent purple podium, and risers bought from a <a href=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v642/shakespeares_sister/shakes3/bozoshow.jpg\">Bozo Show</a> firesale. When the senators walk out, I half expect them to chuck the debate and instead play the <a href=\"http://www.rocketusa.com/products/ProductDetail/item456bozobucketgame.shtml\">Grand Prize Game</a>.</p> <p>Which would actually pretty fun for us all.</p> <p>But, instead, we're treated to watching Barack Obama advocate change, John McCain invoke his record, and Tom Brokaw get snippy because the candidates didn't adhere to the rules and blocked his teleprompter.</p> <p>By the time Obama gives what was a surprisingly stirring response, even to the ears of this jaded cynic, to a question about what each candidate would ask the American people to sacrifice, he is really hitting his stride. He sounds confident. He sounds inspiring. He sounds presidential.</p> <p>McCain, on the other hand, sounds condescending \u2013 perpetually chanting \"My friends, my friends,\" like a manic tic, and answering every question with the breathless voice of a desperate, imploring parent. \"Yes, you've got to go to the dentist,\" says my friend Devo, doing his impression of McCain's beseeching whine, \"but I'll take you to McDonald's afterwards.\"</p> <p>Content-wise, there aren't many revelations for those who have been paying attention to the race. If you've heard their stump speeches, if you've seen or read interviews with them, there isn't much new meat to chew on here. Obama stated flatly that healthcare is a right, which is a beautifully refreshing position to hear from an American presidential candidate. Conversely, McCain defines healthcare as a responsibility.</p> <p>McCain is certainly the more pugilistic of the two, referring snidely to Obama at one point as \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy5CRZKTP0M\">that one</a>,\" which is just cringingly ugly and truly the nadir of McCain's various attempts to treat his opponent with disdain. He attempts a joke about hairplugs, an oblique jab at Joe Biden, which falls flat and looks pointlessly mean (which it is). He belligerently defends his \"Bomb Iran\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-zoPgv_nYg\">performance</a> as a joke. The Republican nominee is suddenly a very long way from the man who, in April, \"<a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/10/party-of-john-mccain.html\">pledged to run a respectful campaign</a>.\"</p> <p>When the debate is over, the two candidates meet onstage. Barack and Michelle Obama stay behind to chat and take pictures with the attendees at the debate, while the McCains beat a rapid retreat. </p> <p>CNN reports that their campaign watchers give the debate to Obama, 54%-30%. McCain needed to win; he did not. He got owned.</p> <p>Say goodnight, Johnny. It's <em>President</em> That One to you.</p>",
  "<p>This is the debate that will be most memorable for what didn't happen.</p> <p>Think back to the build-up. The McCain people, led by the indefatigable Embarracuda, promised that the gloves would come off tonight. Who is the real Barack Obama? Why does he \"pal around\" with a former terrorist? Isn't he too risky? Isn't he not quite a real and regular American? </p> <p>Those were the seeds the McCain campaign led us to believe the candidate would plant at this debate. And what happened? Nothing like that ever came up.</p> <p>This was a function of the format. As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/07/barackobama.johnmccain\">I wrote before the debate</a>, the fact that regular people were asking most of the questions was bound to make it very hard for John McCain to pivot away from talking to a regular voter about his or her economic problems to saying, \"and oh, by the way, let me tell you about Bill Ayers\" and so on. </p> <p>Add to that the fact that the stock market has lost 850 points in the last two days. The voter-questioners \u2013 far preferable to journalists \u2013 wanted answers to actual problems. There were no culture war questions \u2013 not one, about abortion or the Supreme Court or anything of the sort. And there was no room for McCain to hoist the red flags that so excite his base.</p> <p>There was a lot of jabbing back and forth, in fact too much of it, on both candidates' parts. And it didn't work for either candidate. I was watching on CNN, which runs a real-time response meter across the bottom of the screen showing the immediate reactions of swing voters in Ohio. Almost every time one candidate reproached the other on anything like a personal basis, the response meters dipped toward negative territory. It was when they talked about their plans that the needles stayed in positive territory.</p> <p>Bottom line? Don't listen to me, listen to the swing voters. The two immediate post-debate focus-group polls gave Obama the win. A <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/10/07/politics/horserace/entry4508356.shtml\">CBS poll of 400 nationwide uncommitted voters</a> had it Obama 39%, McCain 27%, draw 35%. A small group in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania assembled by MSNBC was less scientific, obviously. There seemed to be about two dozen of them. When the network's Campbell Brown asked for shows of hands on who won, it sure looked to me like about three-quarters of them raised their hands for Obama. Brown pegged it at about 60-40 for Obama. Whatever, she was there.</p> <p>As to what did happen? I thought there were three moments of distinction. The first came when Tom Brokaw asked them to rank how they'd rank energy, healthcare, and entitlement costs as priorities that had to be dealt with. Obama actually answered the question, in the order I listed them. McCain said we don't have to rank them and can do them all. </p> <p>The second came when they were asked what kind of sacrifices they would ask Americans to make as we enter the dark period. Obama invoked 9-11 \u2013 now there's a first, the Democrat mentioning 9-11 before the Republican did \u2013 and said that President Bush had missed an opportunity to rally Americans to a common cause and said he would at least ask people to think about their energy use. McCain mentioned spending cuts and didn't really engage with the question.</p> <p>The third came when Brokaw asked if healthcare was a privilege, a right or a responsibility. McCain chose responsibility, but he didn't say whose. Obama said it was a right. That position may not ultimately win a battle in Congress, but it will win a rhetorical match every time in the minds of swing voters.</p> <p>McCain had his moments. He perked up when the conversation shifted to foreign policy. He was better, in political terms, on Israel and Russia. But Obama stood his ground on the negotiate-with-our-enemies question, and for what it's worth, when he noted that the Bush administration's posture of refusing to talk with Iran and North Korea had pushed both of those nations toward more belligerent postures, the CNN needles were close to the positive roof.</p> <p>McCain's big gambit, of course, was the proposal, new and intended to make news, about the government buying up about $300 billion in bad mortgages. The reaction to think about here is on the right, which will see this as a second bailout. Let's track the outrage over the next two days. It's possible that McCain could lose significant parts of his intelligentsia base over this \u2013 or be forced to walk it back.</p> <p>And finally, the \"that one\" moment. It wasn't racial, to me. It was an old guy speaking slightly awkwardly. I'd bet, however, that black people will see it differently.</p> <p>But again, what was important here is what wasn't said. McCain needed to use this forum to establish a theme about Obama's character. He wasn't able to do it. He and Sarah Palin will go back out on the campaign trail tomorrow and start talking again about Bill Ayers. Obama will go out and talk about the exact same things he talked about in this debate. That's the difference between a campaign that's shooting from the hip and one that's keeping to a game plan. It's no wonder that the gap is slowly widening.</p>",
  "<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338380886\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/8/1223434817234/nashville2.jpg\" alt=\"Obama and McCain debate\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Matthew Cavanaugh/EPA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Evening all. Oddly, if Barack Obama and John McCain were closer in the polls, there might actually be less riding on tonight's debate in Nashville, Tennessee; as things stand, it's crucial. Naturally, I say this partly in an unashamed attempt to get you excited about tonight's liveblogging blogstravaganza, starting here at about <strong>8.45pm eastern time/1.45am UK time</strong>. But it's true: now that Obama has a <a href=\"http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/stumper/archive/2008/10/07/how-was-kerry-doing-four-years-ago-nowhere-near-as-well-as-obama.aspx\">significant and sustained lead in the polls</a>, tonight could be McCain's best remaining opportunity to turn things round. And the town hall format, which involves questions from the audience, is where he's thus far been strongest: that's why he originally <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/06/04/mccain_challenges_obama_to_10.html\">challenged Obama to join him in 10 such events</a>. But that was then.</p> <p>McCain is in a quandary. The general wisdom holds that going relentlessly negative and personal against Obama is his best hope; he needs to change the nature of the race at the national level now, not make piecemeal advances in swing states. (And of course, relentless negativity is exactly what his campaign <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics/AP/story/715637.html\">has been doing</a>.) But going personal and negative is hard in this kind of setting, even when there isn't an economic meltdown you ought to be addressing instead: it's too intimate; your rival's right beside you, so you end up looking mean; plus, it's much harder to <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/10/02/2008-10-02_sarah_palin_ignores_questions_she_doesnt.html\">do a Sarah Palin</a> and ignore the question when it's coming from a voter, not a member of the Notoriously Liberal Media. Every time McCain himself goes negative, he imperils his cultivated bipartisan image; besides, it was his perceived contemptuousness on stage that seems to have helped voters decide that <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/27/debate.poll/\">Obama won the first face-off</a>. (Will J-Mac even manage to look at Obama tonight? Or will he surprise us all, the old maverick, by trying to go ostentatiously \"presidential\"?) Obama has his own challenges, though they're less acute: he has to decide how much to attack, as against trying to stay above the fray in an effort to nurture his lead in the polls, and hold off on \"lawyerly\" answers and condescension.</p> <p>The <strong>format</strong>: Under the terms of a <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/1204162,CST-NWS-sweet06.article\">preposterous 31-page Memorandum of Understanding</a>, the candidates will perch on stools reminiscent of the comedy shows of the late <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Allen_(comedian)\">Dave Allen</a>, six feet apart; they can roam the stage, but mustn't leave their \"designated area\" marked on the carpet. The NBC host Tom Brokaw will moderate, picking questions from a pool 150 undecided voters from the Nashville area, pre-selected by Gallup so that they're demographically representative and so you don't get any of those ghastly ranting eccentrics you get on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/news/anyquestions.shtml\">Any Answers</a>. The live questioners will ask their questions directly, and Brokaw will intersperse them with selections from a reported six million others received by email. (Brokaw's inbox is a nightmare, I'm telling you.) Cameras aren't allowed to show the reactions of the live questioners -- just their initial questions. Earlier today, I chatted with Paul Kirk, co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates, which organises these events, <em>because that's the kind of well-connected person I am</em>, and he fleshed out the procedures: \"Only Tom Brokaw has an inkling of the questions that will be asked. He'll identify a person and call on them; the questioner will ask the question, then be seated. The candidate to whom the question was posed will have two minutes to respond, then the other candidate will have two minutes. Then there'll be one minute of open discussion\" -- but not including the original questioner. (Kirk also said of this year's debate moderators that \"their egos are not without size,\" and confessed to \"pre-game jitters\" before each debate, so there's my scoop of the night thankyouverymuch.) I'll welcome suggestions for the rules of tonight's <strong>drinking game</strong>, though by now I hope you've figured out that it's really just an excuse to drink beer while I work. The tipple of choice here at Guardian Election Central this evening is <a href=\"http://www.bluemoonbrewery.com/\">Blue Moon Brewery Harvest Moon Pumpkin Ale</a>. You may compliment my beer choice in the comments. Cast your vote for drunkenness, here from <strong>8.45pm eastern</strong>!</p> <p><strong>8.49pm</strong> (all times eastern): Tom Brokaw's now introducing himself to the audience and requesting that they act with \"deportment\", explaining that he won't tolerate \"outbursts.\" The invited guests are sitting on blocks of seats in a horsehoe shape, with the candidates' seats in the gap. By the way, I ought to have informed you that the venue tonight, Belmont University, a Christian college in Tennessee, boasts among its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_University#Notable_alumni\">alumni </a>Lee Ann Womack, Trisha Yearwood and Brad Paisley. Yes, we're in country country...</p> <p><strong>8.57pm</strong>: Some good drinking-game suggestions in comments. I particularly like RachelINLondon's \"reach across the aisle\", and of course McCain's personal tic, \"my friends\". (Remember also that Obama announces major policy changes by saying \"as I've said before\"...)</p> <p><strong>9.00pm</strong>: Here we go. Brokaw introduces. I think he thinks he's a pretty great guy, you know. And here are our friends Mr Obama and Mr McCain. They shake hands; this time they <em>both</em> do the alpha-male hand-on-the-other's-forearm thing. Obama answers first, on the basis of a coin flip. A man called Alan Shaffer wants to know how the ordinary victims of the economic crisis will be \"bailed out.\" Obama didn't stay long on his stool, if he sat there at all; he goes straight into an attack on the Bush administration, then sets out his \"rescue package for the middle classes\". Hmm, I just tried a bit of this beer \u2014 it's not as good as the Brooklyn Brewery IPA from last week, I have to say. </p> <p>McCain thanks Brokaw and Belmont and gives a sort of strange twitchy thanks to Obama, though it's not clear whether he actually looked at him. I rather think he didn't. He makes a somewhat forced half-joke about Obama not accepting his earlier town hall invitations, then responds Palinistically, diving into energy independence. \"My friends\" twice in one answer: drink! Brokaw asks him who he'd appoint as Treasury secretary. \"Not you, Tom,\" McCain says. Aaaand we have our first bafflingly strange answer of the evening.</p> <p><strong>9.11pm</strong>: A young man named Oliver Clark who asks a fairly similar question to the last one, about the fate of ordinary people in the meltdown. But it's a better question, because the questioner's name is Oliver: now there's a name that says wit, intelligence and all-round accomplishment! McCain strides over and stares at him, condescendingly suggesting he might never have heard of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac before the crisis. He blames Obama's \"cronies and his friends in Washington\" for the problem. And he refers back to Alan, the first questioner. This could get confusing. Obama: \"I've got to correct a little bit of senator McCain's history, not surprisingly... as recently as March, he bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator.\" He's working hard to stress the McCain/lobbyists link. </p> <p><strong>9.17pm</strong>: McCain: American workers are \"the innocent bystanders in the biggest financial crisis of our time.\"</p> <p><strong>9.18pm</strong>: \"How can we trust either of you with our money when both parties got us into this global economic crisis?\" asks a woman whose name I missed. Good point. Obama calls her cynical, but in a nice Obama way. He says he understands her cynicism. But when Bush came into office, things were better; deficit spending and a skyrocketing national debt are a phenomenon of the last eight years.</p> <p>Ah. Theresa is her name, John McCain reminds me, because he seems to have decided to use every questioner's name many times tonight. He says he's \"reached across the aisle\" \u2014 a drink, you betcha! McCain says Obama's never really opposed the leaders of his party, and dives into his absolute favourite subject ever: earmarks. Including Obama's sickening support of... $3m for an overhead projector for a planetarium in Chicago! Scandalous. Although presumably overhead projectors in planetaria aren't the normal kind that you use in presentations at work. I'd imagine they are actually fairly pricey. [I was racing so fast during this whole stretch that I didn't even mention McCain's <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSN0748978520081008\">newsmaking notion</a> that the government should buy up bad mortgages.]</p> <p>Hey! On social security, McCain just \"sat down across the table\" and \"reached across the aisle\" almost at exactly the same time! That's like Cirque du Soleil or something. (Do they have contortionists? I don't recall.)</p> <p><strong>9.26pm</strong>: Brokaw, who's ticking the candidates off repeatedly for overshooting their one-minute followups, asks the ridiculous question about which of the major policy areas they'd prioritise, since money will be so short. No candidate will ever answer in an ordered list... although Obama seems to be doing so -- energy then healthcare then social security and Medicare. Really? Maybe he was just enumerating them.<br> <strong>9.29pm</strong>: First internet question: \"ECONOMIC CRISIS WTF!!1! LOL kthxbye.\" No, not really. The first internet question is from a \"child of the depression\", who wants to know when Americans are going to be asked to make sacrifices. McCain: earmarks earmarks overhead projector earmarks. Obama begins his reply, unexpectedly, with 9/11, and how Bush asked Americans to \"go out and shop\". That wasn't the kind of service people felt called to then, he says, and talks about the Peace Corps. The uncommitted Ohio voters on CNN's bottom-of-the-screen crawl are loving it.</p> <p><strong>9.35pm</strong>: A question on how to break America's bad habit of debt and credit. McCain says keeping track of Obama's tax policies is like \"nailing jelly to the wall.\" \"Senator Obama's secret, that you don't know...\" -- sounds ominous... but in fact the answer is to do with the alleged impact of Obama's tax policies on small businesses. McCain promises a $5,000 tax credit to all and sundry. Brokaw is being way too obsessive about trying to hold the candidates to their one-minute follow-ups; Obama wants to respond on taxes but isn't allowed.</p> <p><strong>9.40pm</strong>: Would you give Congress a date to reform social security and Medicare? Obama glides back into the tax message he's trying to hammer home: almost everyone, including most small businesses, won't experience tax cuts under his proposals. \"If you make less than $250,000 a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up.\" McCain: \"<em>I'll</em> answer the question,\" he says, chuckling weirdly. Obama has never taken on his own party, he says again (except, like, denying Hillary Clinton the nomination...) </p> <p><strong>9.45pm</strong>: A question on forcing rapid action on climate change. McCain's answer is a little all over the place, and he seems to miss the questioner's name -- me, too! -- but focuses on the importance of nuclear power, and Obama's alleged opposition to it. Obama: it's an opportunity as well as a crisis -- \"the same way the computer was an engine for economic growth\". \"What's a computer?\" asks McCain. (Joke.) Neither candidate gives much real detail, and certainly not on non-nuclear energy sources.</p> <p>Brokaw is turning into a pompous fool about this one-minute rule thing. McCain wants him to wave at him when his time is up.</p> <p>McCain brings up a Bush/Cheney-backed energy bill \"stuffed full\" of goodies for the oil companies. \"Know who voted for it? That guy,\" he says, not looking at Obama. \"Know who voted against it? I did...\" Deeply unappealing body language. [Correction: Apparently he said \"that one\".]</p> <p><strong>9.52pm</strong>: Obama is answering a good question on whether healthcare should be treated as a commodity at all, and <em>McCain is just randomly wandering around the stage</em>. As that internet questioner didn't say earlier: WTF? (PS. Have we only had one internet question out of 6m so far?) McCain's long answer, setting out his healthcare policy in the usual terms, ends by bringing up \"hair transplants\". He \"jokes\" that he might need one of those! Ha ha ha! Yeah, me too actually. </p> <p>Brokaw asks if healthcare is a right, a privilege or a responsibility. McCain: a responsibility. Obama: a right. (Body language observation: unlike McCain, when Obama attacks his rival, accusing him of opposing expansion of healthcare insurance for children, he turns to him.) Obama's explaining now why McCain's cross-state health insurance policy wouldn't work.</p> <p>McCain has been tweaking Obama for the last few minutes about the fines he says would be involved in enforcing Obama's mandatory health insurance. As Brokaw tries to move on to foreign policy, he turns to the audience and says \"Did we hear the size of the fine?\" and does a funny little hand gesture plus chuckle. Very offputting. Nobody else laughs, perhaps because Brokaw has told them not to, or perhaps because McCain's not actually being funny.</p> <p><strong>10.00pm</strong>: McCain repeats his \"Senator Obama doesn't understand\" motif. Obama: \"It's true, there are some things I don't understand \u2014 I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11,\" starving resources from fighting al-Qaeda. A good answer on Iraq from Obama.</p> <p><strong>10.05pm</strong>: Brokaw wants the two candidates to describe their personal doctrines on the use of force for humanitarian purposes. Obama brings up the Holocaust and the Rwandan genocide as incontrovertible examples of the morality of intervention. McCain: \"Let me just follow up, my friends\" -- yeah, drink, whatever. McCain says following Obama's proposals on Iraq would bring \"our troops home in defeat.\"</p> <p><strong>10.09pm</strong>: The Pakistan border question, from one Katie Hamm: should America respect Pakistan's sovereignty, or chase enemies across the border from Afghanistan as necessary, as in Cambodia? Obama answers a mainly different question: bringing the focus back from Iraq to Afghanistan/Pakistan. </p> <p>McCain recalls his \"hero\", Teddy Roosevelt: \"Speak softly and carry a big stick\", ie, don't announce your plans to invade Pakistan, like Obama allegedly suggested. (And, uh, Sarah Palin, I seem to recall?) But wait -- a few moments ago McCain's \"hero\" was Reagan. Which is it? A nation wants to know.</p> <p>Another tussle on follow-up questions. Obama: \"Can I have a followup?\" McCain, looking genuinely irritated: If Obama gets a followup, \"I'll want a followup, too...\" Obama uses his follow-up to remind everyone of McCain's <em>hilarious</em> \"Bomb Bomb Bomb Iran\" Beach Boys parody hilariousness. McCain seems quite riled. \"I was joking with an old veteran friend about Iran... but the point is, I know how to handle these crises... I'll get Osama bin Laden, my friends, I'll get him. I know how to get him. I'll get him.\" But how? \"I'm not going to telegraph my punches.\" But how? Oh, never mind.</p> <p><strong>10.17pm</strong>: Hurrah! Britain gets a mention, in a Brokaw question. Embarrassingly, it's in the context of the leaked news earlier this week about how the British ambassador to Afghanistan thinks the best that can be hoped for there is an \"acceptable dictator\". McCain says Obama still won't admit the surge in Iraq worked, which is the kind of thing Afghanistan needs, too. The CNN uncommitted-voters-line is flat and unresponsive about this.</p> <p><strong>10.21pm</strong>: Live breaking Guardian commentator news update! Jonathan Freedland texts my colleague Richard Adams to say McCain reminds him of Bob Dole in this debate performance. Oh, the candidates? They're talking about Russia. McCain repeats his anecdote about seeing the letters KGB in Vladimir Putin's eyes, and shortly afterwards stresses that he wouldn't restart the Cold War. He refuses to say whether Russia is an evil empire today.</p> <p><strong>10.25pm</strong>: Terry Shirey, retired Navy officer: \"I know both of you have expressed support for Israel. If despite your best diplomatic efforts, Iran attacks Israel,\" would you send US troops to defend Israel, or wait for the UN? McCain thanks the questioner for his service, repeatedly, and shakes his hand. (I'm pretty sure that breaks the Memo of Understanding, no?) Of course, McCain would not wait for the UN, because they're a bunch of pesky Euro-communists. Whereas Obama, he says, would sit down and negotiate with Iran \"without preconditions\". Oh, we're here again. Is Obama going to try to clarify the difference between preconditions and preparations again? McCain wants to create a League fo Democracies. </p> <p>\"But at the end of the day, my friend, and you know what it's like to serve, and you know what it's like to sacrifice, and you know that we could never allow a second Holocaust.\"</p> <p>Obama thanks Shirey for his service, too, but in a more restrained fashion. Iran must never get a nuclear weapon, he says. He repeats his line that communicating with Iran would enable the US to communicate a dire warning about the consequences of getting one. CNN's Ohio voters seem to like it.</p> <p><strong>10.30pm</strong>: Last question, from Peggy in New Hampshire. \"It has a certain Zen-like quality... what don't you know, and how will you learn it?\" Fantastic question, although a bit Rumsfeldian. Obama says Michelle Obama, who's in the audience, would give a better answer to the question. \"I know I wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for the fact that this country gave me opportunity... the question in this election is: are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation?\" We've seen the dream diminish over the last eight years, he says. (The Ohio women, especially, are loving this part.) \"We can't expect that if we do the same things we've been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome. We need fundamental change...\" He says people will need \"nerve and courage\" to continue \"the extraordinary journey that we call America.\"</p> <p>What McCain doesn't know is \"what's going to happen.\" Er, yes. In the future \"we'll be talking about countries that we hardly know where they are on the map -- some Americans.\" (Spain, perhaps?) \"What I don't know is what the unexpected will be.\" Now <em>that's</em> Zen-like. McCain knows what it's like \"to have your comrades pick you up and out you up in the fight... I'm asking the American people to give me another chance\" to lead it from its current woes. It strikes me that we've heard surprisingly little of McCain's wartime record tonight, relatively speaking.</p> <p>And that's it. Both candidates dive off to do some heavy-duty audience-handshaking, and, finally, with each other, though awkwardly. [Wednesday morning update: actually, the story of the handshake is more complex than this, and I'll blog about it shortly.] As far as I could see, Obama worked the crowd for much longer than McCain. In a Clintonesque refusing-to-leave-the-room fashion, one pundit said.</p> <p><strong>11.40pm update</strong>: The breakdown of my blogging software enables me cunningly to postpone my final judgment until after the results of the CNN and CBS snap polls of debate viewers, both of which say Obama won: CNN by 54% to 30% (with Obama's favourables up and his unfavourables down, both unchanged for McCain); CBS 39% to 27%. <a href=\"http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/10/wrapping_up.php\">Matthew Yglesias</a>: \"It's extremely surprising to me, tactically, that McCain didn't try to do something new. Instead, McCain took the same talking points (earmarks bad, tax cuts good, earmarks very bad) that have seen him fall behind and decided to repeat them with less energy.\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/your_town_hall_2_debate_wrapup.php\">James Fallows:</a> \"From a horse-race perspective, John McCain came in behind and losing ground, in the middle of a financial/economic panic that works against him, and therefore needing a big win. This meant either damaging and flummoxing Obama, or so outshining him in audience rapport, mastery of policy, and empathetic connection through the camera, that the debate could be presented as a turning point. None of that happened. (McCain's best performance was at the end, rejecting a \"Yes/No\" question on whether Russia is an \"evil empire.\") At this stage in the race, a tie goes to leader, and this was not a tie.\" </p> <p>The conservatives at <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/\">The Corner</a> are mainly quite depressed, too. Oh, and: <a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/10/a-new-slogan.html\">that was quick</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/poll/2008/oct/08/uselections2008.debate.obama.mccain\">Now vote in our poll!</a> You know it makes sense.</p> <p><strong>Midnight</strong>: There's a detectible sense among the punditocracy, on television and on the web, that the election might prove to have been decided here tonight. Only a fool would say that outright, of course, so few do, but this wasn't the debate McCain needed: on the one hand, he didn't go for \"presidential\"; on the other hand, he didn't go for \"Bill Ayers\" character attacks like we've heard in Palin's recent stump speeches. A month is an exceptionally long time in politics, etcetera, etcetera. But I don't see how it could have gone much better for Obama, who made no errors, and remained authoratitive and empathetic -- \"presidential\" -- throughout. McCain seemed to try-but-fail to deliver a new and newly detailed economic argument that only ended up <a href=\"http://blogs.forbes.com/trailwatch/2008/10/mccains-big-new.html\">raising more questions</a>; he had at least one incredibly odd moment, calling Obama \"that one\", and more generally his dripping contempt for Obama was as evident as ever. He tried to coax the audience into laughing with him at Obama, which fell flat. To the extent that these things are about the broad-brush impressions that the candidates manage to convey, the impression was that it was Obama who was in command, all the way through.</p> <p>So does this mean McCain gets even more dirty and relentlessly negative from here on in? Would it make any difference if he did? I don't know. My job is to pose rhetorical questions, and then go to bed. Thanks for reading, and please keep commenting...</p>"
