  "<p>Two California police officers were shot dead on Saturday while responding to a family disturbance in the town of Palm Springs, and a third was injured as police tried to bring a suspect into custody, officials said.</p> <p>Following a prolonged hunt for the suspect overnight on Saturday, the county sheriff\u2019s department said on Twitter early on Sunday morning that the suspect had been taken into custody.</p> <p>The Riverside County sheriff\u2019s department identified the suspect as John Felix and said he would be charged with two counts of murder on a peace officer. Officials said Felix surrendered after a lengthy stand-off. He was injured and treated at a hospital.</p> <p>Court records showed Felix, 26, to be a gang member who was previously sentenced to four years in prison in a failed murder plot. The <a href=\"http://desert.sn/2dCyJV8\">Desert Sun newspaper</a> cited documents that showed Felix was also the subject of a forceful arrest three years ago, at the same house where Saturday\u2019s shootings occurred.</p> <p>Felix was charged with attempted murder in a 2009 shooting. Records showed he pleaded down to assault with a firearm and admitted his gang connection.</p> <p>The two officers were killed when a man they had been speaking with suddenly pulled out a gun and opened fire, Palm Springs police chief Bryan Reyes said. The third officer remained hospitalized. Reyes named the dead officers as Jose Vega and Lesley Zerebny.</p> <p>On Saturday afternoon, with the suspect on the loose, police set up a \u201ccontainment area\u201d for several blocks around the house where the shooting took place. Several Swat teams were involved in the search for the suspect. Residents were told to evacuate and not to answer their doors.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m awake in a nightmare right now,\u201d Reyes said at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s me, but as the chief of police I\u2019ve got to step forward and stay focused. We will do what we need to do.\u201d </p> <p>He later added: \u201cIt was a simple family disturbance and [the suspect] elected to open fire on a few of the guardians of the city.\u201d</p> <p>Reyes said the three were standing near the front door speaking with the man, \u201ctrying to negotiate with the suspect\u201d, when he suddenly shot them.<br></p> <p>Zerebny, 27, had been with the department for about 18 months and only recently returned from maternity leave after giving birth to a now four-month-old daughter. Vega, a father of eight, was a 35-year veteran who planned to retire in December. He had been working overtime on his day off. The wounded officer\u2019s name was not released.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a75baa4f6d7553e57a837752f8283141fce4214d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a75baa4f6d7553e57a837752f8283141fce4214d/0_0_3036_2138/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Palm Springs shooting\" width=\"1000\" height=\"704\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Palm Springs police officer returns to his car.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Mircovich/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Saturday, scores of police officers gathered at Palm Springs desert regional medical center to offer a somber salute as the bodies of Zerebny and Vega were loaded into white hearses for transport to a coroner\u2019s office. In front of police headquarters, scores of local residents gathered to leave flowers, balloons and cards Saturday night.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t even remember anything so vicious and cruel,\u201d said Palm Springs resident Heidi Thompson. \u201cThese officers are responding to a domestic call for somebody in need that they don\u2019t even know. They put their life on the line for us, the community. And they get gunned down? I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p> <p>Witnesses <a href=\"http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/crime_courts/2016/10/08/palm-springs-officer-involved-shooting-leads-heightened-police-activity/91797350/\">told the Desert Sun</a> that they heard 10 to 20 gun shots before 2pm local time. \u201cIt sounded like fireworks at first,\u201d neighbor Juan Garciano told the paper. \u201cI came out of the house and saw police start to block the roads.\u201d</p>"
