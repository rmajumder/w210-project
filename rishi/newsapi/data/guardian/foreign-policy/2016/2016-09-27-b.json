  "<h2><strong>Donald Trump\u2019s claims</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Trump: \u201cOur jobs are fleeing the country, they\u2019re going to Mexico they\u2019re going to many other countries \u2026 Hundreds of hundreds of companies are doing this.\u201d</strong></h2> <p>Trump is primarily talking about the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the long-term decline in manufacturing around the US can\u2019t only be attributed to the trade deal. Economists still debate the effect of the deal on jobs, since US trade with Canada and Mexico is modest at best. In 2015, the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/06/22/483100251/fact-check-trumps-speech-on-clinton-annotated\">Congressional Research Service wrote</a>: \u201cNafta did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.\u201d</p> <p>Manufacturing is down 37% <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP\">since its peak in 1979</a>, but this change has a great deal to do with the general shift toward a service-based economy, which the US has had surpluses in in recent years. It\u2019s true that many manufacturing jobs have been outsourced, especially since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, but it\u2019s also true that the US has added more than 800,000 factory jobs since 2010.</p> <h2><strong>Trump: \u201cMy father gave me a small loan in 1975.\u201d</strong></h2> <p>Trump never struggled for money or started with anything modest. In 1978 his father gave him a loan totaling almost $1m \u2013 about $3.7m today \u2013 and acted as guarantor for the young Trump\u2019s early projects. A 1981 <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/301761265/Report-on-Donald-Trump-to-Casino-Control-Commission\">report by a New Jersey regulator</a> also shows a $7.5m loan from the patriarch, and years later he <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/1991-04-09/news/25780577_1_casino-control-act-donald-trump-casino-owners\">bought $3.5m in gambling chips</a> to help his son pay off the debts of a failing casino, which was <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/1991-04-09/news/25780577_1_casino-control-act-donald-trump-casino-owners\">found to have broken the law by accepting them</a>. Trump also <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/christophermassie/donald-trump-in-deposition-96-million-i-borrowed-from-dads-e?utm_term=.eboXJGMWG#.qbNV4Jl1J\">borrowed millions against his inheritance</a> before his father\u2019s death, a 2007 deposition shows.</p> <p>Trump has not proven that he is worth $10bn, though his tax returns, which he has refused to release, could provide a clearer picture of his worth. His financial filings suggest he has<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/self-financing-campaign-all-the-way-would-have-been-a-stretch-for-trump-1463341722\"> less than $250m in liquid assets</a>, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. Trump has a history of overstating his properties: he has, for instance, told the FEC that a New York golf club is worth $50m but also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/12/donald-trump-briarcliff-manor-golf-course-tax\">argued in court that it is worth only $1.4m</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Trump claimed that his tax plan will be the largest cuts since Ronald Reagan and create jobs, while in his words Clinton\u2019s would create a huge tax hike.</strong></h2> <p>Trump\u2019s tax plan would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">disproportionately help the wealthiest Americans</a>, saving them millions of dollars and adding trillions to the national debt, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-tax-reform-plan-september-2016\">according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation</a>, a conservative thinktank. He would reduce the business tax rate to 15%, eliminate the estate tax (aka the \u201cdeath tax\u201d), which mostly affects wealthy inheritors, and would reduce revenue from taxes by about $5tn. According to the Foundation, the top 1% of earners would see a 10.2% increase to their incomes.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2016/01/12/investing-in-america-by-restoring-basic-fairness-to-our-tax-code/\">tax plan</a> does not change tax rates for the middle class, but does increase taxes by 4% on people who have an adjusted income of more than $5m, as well as closing corporate loopholes. Only about <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/tax-analysis/Documents/TP-4.pdf\">0.5%</a> of small businesses in the US reported a profit of more than $1m in 2011, according to the US treasury department. Clinton would increase tax revenue by $1.1tn by taxing the top 1% of earners, increasing the estate tax and eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, and by implementing and a more complex tax code,<a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-hillary-clintons-tax-proposals\"> according to the Tax Policy Center</a>.</p> <p>Trump has not proven that he pays any federal income tax, and did not deny that he doesn\u2019t pay, saying simply that it would prove he\u2019s \u201csmart\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Trump: </strong><strong>\u201cAfrican Americans and Hispanics are living in hell because it\u2019s so dangerous. In Chicago they\u2019ve had thousands of shootings since 1 January \u2026 Almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed since Barack Obama became president.\u201d</strong></h2> <p>Trump often cites Chicago\u2019s shooting crisis as evidence that the US is plagued by dangerous crime, but not even that city, which has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/08/us/us-murder-rates.html\">the most homicides in the US</a>, compares to a \u201cwar zone\u201d as Trump says. In 2015, Chicago had 2,988 people who were victims of gun violence, according to <a href=\"http://crime.chicagotribune.com/chicago/shootings/\">the Chicago Tribune</a>, and 488 homicides in all. The city has <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-chicago-violence-labor-day-tuesday-20160906-story.html\">more than 500 homicides</a> so far this year, per the paper, and more than 2,100 victims of gun violence. Since 2009, the year of Obama\u2019s inauguration, the city has seen more than 3,640 homicides, according to the Tribune.</p> <p>In Afghanistan \u2013 a country Trump often compares the city to \u2013 between January and June 2016, 1,601 civilians have been killed and 3,565 injured, <a href=\"http://unama.unmissions.org/afghanistan-record-level-civilian-casualties-sustained-first-half-2016-un-report\">according to the United Nations.</a> The figures include 388 killed and 1,121 injured children. The UN reported 3,545 civilians killed and 7,457 injured in 2015. More than 80,000 people have been <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/world/middleeast/civilian-casualties-in-afghan-war-are-unabated-in-2016.html\">displaced by violence</a> this year. The US and Afghan forces control only about 70% of the country, while the Taliban and militants control the other 30%, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/09/22/u-s-backed-forces-control-70-percent-of-afghanistan-us-military-chief-says/\"> told the Senate</a> on Thursday.</p> <h2><strong>Trump on stop and frisk police tactics: \u201cStop and frisk which worked very well in New York it \u2026 It brought the crime rate way down.\u201d</strong></h2> <p>The controversial police tactic of stop and frisk, which became a hallmark of New York policing through the mayorships of Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg, has landed the city in federal court, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/12/new-york-stop-and-frisk-unconstitutional-judge\">a judge ruled it unconstitutional</a>. One research paper, unpublished through peer review, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/08/20/ray-kelly-says-stop-frisk-saves-lives-theres-no-good-evidence-for-that/\">found modest drops</a> in some crimes. A<a href=\"http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/rosenfeld_fornango.pdf\"> second paper</a>, published through peer review, found problems in the first study and \u201cfew significant effects\u201d of the tactic.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.nyclu.org/publications/report-stop-and-frisk-during-bloomberg-administration-2002-2013-2014\">New York Civil Liberties Union report</a>, on 12 years\u2019 worth of police data, found young black and Hispanic men were targeted for stops at a vastly higher proportion than white men: more than half the people searched were black and about 30% were Hispanic. Among more than 5m stops during the Bloomberg administration, police found a gun less than 0.02% of the time, according to the report. NYPD <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/08/new_york_s_stop_and_frisk_policy_is_neither_effective_nor_constitutional.html\">records between 2004 and 2012</a> show similar figures: in 4.4m stops, weapons were seized from 1.0% of black people, 1.1% from Hispanic people and 1.4% of white people.</p> <p>New York\u2019s long-term decline in crime rates began before Giuliani took office in 1994, and<a href=\"http://www.city-journal.org/html/how-new-york-became-safe-full-story-13197.html\"> its causes were and are diverse</a>: data-driven policing <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/inside-look-system-cut-crime-new-york-75-percent-n557031\">with the Compstat system</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/what-caused-crime-decline\">growth of the police force by 35%</a> over the decade, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/what-caused-the-crime-decline/477408/\">incarceration increases by 24%</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/digest/jan03/w9061.html\">the 39% unemployment decline</a> that matched with national economic growth. Not even the loudest supporters of stop and frisk, including Bloomberg \u2013 whose last term Trump has called \u201ca disaster\u201d \u2013 have argued the tactic alone reduced crime to its current lows.</p> <p>Trump said that the tactic was ruled unconstitutional because of a judge \u201cwho was against policing\u201d, but his personal opinion about the judge does not mean she did not rule it unconstitutional.</p> <h2><strong>Trump: \u201cWe have to take the guns away from the people that shouldn\u2019t have them \u2026 These are bad people.\u201d</strong></h2> <p>This argument flies in the face of Trump\u2019s pro-gun rights stance for legal owners; he has repeatedly and falsely insisted that Clinton wants to take away guns from legal owners.</p> <p>Trump claimed that New York\u2019s crime rate is up since the end of stop and frisk. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/nyregion/anxiety-aside-new-york-sees-drop-in-crime.html\">It remains near historic lows</a>.</p> <h2>Trump blames Sidney Blumenthal, a friend of the Clinton\u2019s, and Patti Solis Doyle, a 2008 <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/story?id=4269776\">campaign manager</a>, for creating the false claim that Barack Obama was not born in the US.</h2> <p>There is no evidence that Clinton or her campaign had anything to do with the false rumors that Barack Obama was not born in the US, nor did Clinton have anything to do with Trump\u2019s five years of questions about birth certificates, which he finally recanted last Friday.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign has tried to blame several people who were, if at all, tangentially related to the Clinton campaign. There is no evidence that Solis Doyle had anything to do with the claim either. She told CNN that<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/16/politics/hillary-clinton-patti-solis-doyle-birther-donald-trump/\"> there was a volunteer coordinator in Iowa who forwarded the email</a> and that the volunteer was dismissed, and that she called the Obama campaign to apologize.</p> <p>A former aide named Mark Penn wrote a <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/4097983/Penn-Strategy-Memo-3-19-07#fullscreen&amp;from_embed\">2007 memo</a> that Obama\u2019s \u201clack of American roots\u201d could \u201chold him back\u201d. But he added: \u201cWe are never going to say anything about his background.\u201d The Clinton campaign <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/09/the-front-runner-s-fall/306944/\">never</a> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2008/08/clinton-told-to-portray-obama-as-foreign-012420\">acted</a> on his advice, and he <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/07/us/politics/07hillary.html\">was dismissed</a> in April 2008.<br></p> <p>Some Clinton supporters have been blamed over <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/citizen.asp\">anonymous chain emails</a> for questioning Obama\u2019s citizenship, but none of the rumormongers were linked to the campaign. Philip Berg, a former Pennsylvania official who supported Clinton, filed a lawsuit in 2008 over Obama\u2019s birth certificate; the suit was<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/01/29/supreme-court-ousts-attorney-who-sued-to-oust-obama/\"> thrown out because it was groundless</a>.

The terror group largely formed out of the remnants of Saddam Hussein\u2019s government and the factions that formed al-Qaida in Iraq \u2013 all of which happened in the last decade or so.

Trump is correct in an extremely technical sense: no one has provided 100% proof that Russia was behind the hack, and the Obama administration has proven loath to escalate a hacking war. But security experts have found technical fingerprints that seem to hint back toward Russia, just as they have found <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/world/asia/us-decides-to-retaliate-against-chinas-hacking.html\">links back to Chinese hacks in unrelated cases</a>.</p> <h2>Trump: \u201cPresident Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum\u201d for Isis.</h2> <p>The claim that Obama and Clinton created the conditions for Isis ignores that Isis\u2019s first <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/19/world/middleeast/in-rise-of-isis-no-single-missed-key-but-many-strands-of-blame.html\">segments</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/world/middleeast/us-actions-in-iraq-fueled-rise-of-a-rebel.html\">formed</a> out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/11/-sp-isis-the-inside-story\">post-invasion civil war</a> in Iraq, while George W Bush was president; that the group took root in Syria\u2019s civil war, where the US did not intervene until 2014; and that Obama withdrew American forces in 2011 under the <a href=\"http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081214-2.html\">timeline</a> agreed on by Bush and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/world/middleeast/united-states-and-iraq-had-not-expected-troops-would-have-to-leave.html\">Baghdad</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Trump has claimed that Nato must turn to a directly anti-terror campaign in the Middle East, and that his urging has already influenced the alliance.</strong></h2> <p>But Nato has had <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2014_10/20151029_141007-dat-prog.pdf\">a Defense Against Terrorism program</a> since June 2004, almost a full 12 years before Trump called the alliance \u201cobsolete\u201d.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/265895292191248385\">November 6, 2012</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>Clinton claimed that African American men are more likely to be killed by guns than other demographics.</h2> <p>She is <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/black-americans-are-killed-at-12-times-the-rate-of-people-in-other-developed-countries/\">broadly correct</a> that African American men are disproportionately affected by gun violence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/31/the-counted-police-killings-2015-young-black-men\">including by police</a>. She\u2019s also correct that crime rates are overall still down from where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/rate-murder-fbi-increase\">they were in the 1990s</a>, but she omits the 10.8% single-year increase in murders in 2015. The recent spike in violent crime has been concentrated in a handful of cities, such as Chicago, Washington DC and Baltimore.</p> <h2>Clinton: Trump has been \u201cpraiseworthy of Vladimir Putin\u201d. Trump: \u201cWrong.\u201d</h2> <p>Trump has repeatedly called Russia\u2019s president a \u201cstrong leader\u201d and spoken approvingly \u2013 \u201cpraise\u201d by nearly any definition \u2013 of this strength and Putin\u2019s polling numbers. For instance, on 18 December 2015 he <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/12/18/donald-trump-praises-putin-as-strong-leader/\">told MSNBC</a>: \u201cI\u2019ve always felt fine about Putin. I think that he\u2019s a strong leader.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cHe\u2019s running his country and at least he\u2019s a leader, unlike what we have in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Last September, he <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-gives-russias-putin-an-a-in-leadership/\">told Fox News</a>: \u201cIn terms of leadership [Putin\u2019s] getting an A.\u201d In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA2rmuJu9c\">a 10 March debate</a>, Trump tried to hedge on semantics. \u201cStrong doesn\u2019t mean good,\u201d he said. \u201cPutin is a strong leader, absolutely. He is a strong leader. Now I don\u2019t say that in a good way or a bad way. I say it as a fact.\u201d</p> <h2>Clinton: \u201cDonald supported the invasion of Iraq.\u201d Trump: \u201cWrong.\u201d</h2> <p>This is a lie. In the months before the Iraq war began, the businessman made a tepid endorsement of invasion to <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/buzzfeedandrew/trump-on-the-howard-stern-show-on-sept-11-2002?utm_source=soundcloud&amp;utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">radio host Howard Stern</a>, who asked him whether he thought the US should attack Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d Trump answered.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/buzzfeedandrew/trump-on-the-howard-stern-show-on-sept-11-2002?utm_source=soundcloud&amp;utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=twitter\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F247792345&show_artwork=true&=&utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=soundcloud\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>A few weeks later he told Fox News that George W Bush was \u201cdoing a very good job\u201d. Several weeks after the invasion, Trump told the Washington Post: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/archive/lifestyle/2003/03/25/hollywood-partyers-soldiering-on/06327347-83d3-44c4-ab7b-dcd6fbda5437/?resType=accessibility\">The war\u2019s a mess</a>.\u201d In August 2004 he told <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/interviews/a37230/donald-trump-esquire-cover-story-august-2004/\">Esquire</a>: \u201cTwo minutes after we leave, there\u2019s going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over.\u201d<br></p> <p>Even in <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/christophermassie/a-guide-to-donald-trump-early-flip-flops-on-the-iraq-war?utm_term=.vq5VjeKwe#.uy2eDvV5v\">an interview</a> cited by the Trump campaign to explain his \u201copposition\u201d, Trump expressed impatience with Bush for not invading sooner. \u201cWhatever happened to the days of the Douglas MacArthur? He would go and attack. He wouldn\u2019t talk.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also supported complete withdrawal from Iraq, even in the event of continued civil war or authoritarian violence there. \u201cYou know how they get out? They get out. That\u2019s how they get out. Declare victory and leave,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0703/18/le.01.html\">told CNN</a> in 2007. \u201cThis is a total catastrophe, and you might as well get out now because you\u2019re just wasting time, and lives.\u201d</p> <p>Like Clinton, Trump also supported military strikes in Libya, saying in <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-claims-he-didnt-support-libya-intervention-but-he-did?utm_term=.cxLgP37W3#.je5XJqPgq\">a February 2011 video blog</a> that the US should take \u201cimmediate\u201d action against dictator Muammar Ghaddafi.</p> <p>\u201cWe should go in, we should stop this guy, which would be be very easy and very quick. We could do it surgically.\u201d No one supported an occupation to \u201cbuild democracy\u201d there in the model of George W Bush\u2019s occupation of Iraq.</p>"
