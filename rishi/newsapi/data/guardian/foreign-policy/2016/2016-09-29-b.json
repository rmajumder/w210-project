The suits also allege that the city was told about Gonsalves\u2019s behavior and did nothing. Gonsalves was demoted to officer from sergeant after the allegations.</p> <p>Early on Tuesday afternoon, police were called to a strip mall by Olango\u2019s sister, who said that her brother was \u201cnot acting like himself\u201d. <br></p> <p>Police claim that Olango was shot after he put his hands up in a \u201cshooting stance\u201d, and they released a still frame from a cellphone video taken by an eyewitness that appears to show a man with his hands raised as if holding a gun.</p> <p>Police have not released the rest of the video, however, and other eyewitnesses dispute the police\u2019s account. Michael Ray Rodriguez told the <a href=\"http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/crime-courts-fire/sd-me-cajon-ois-20160927-story.html\">San Diego Union-Tribune</a> that he saw a shirtless black man with his hands in the air before officers opened fire.</p> <p>Harrowing video posted to Facebook Live shows the immediate aftermath of the shooting, in which Olango\u2019s sister can be heard crying. \u201cI just called you for help, and you came here and you killed him,\u201d she tells police at one point.</p> <p>The El Cajon mayor did not address Gonsalves\u2019s lawsuits on Wednesday. He said that the FBI was joining the San Diego district attorney in conducting independent investigations into Olango\u2019s death, and that they would release further information, including the video of the incident, at the district attorney\u2019s discretion.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe El Cajon police department is doing an investigation, the San Diego district attorney is doing an investigation \u2026 also the FBI will be doing this investigation as well,\u201d Wells told reporters on Wednesday afternoon.</p> <p>The full video has not been released, and Wells said that it would be up to the San Diego district attorney to decide when to release it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/28/san-diego-police-shooting-aftermath-you-came-and-killed-him-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/55xqy\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2757072\"            data-video-name=\"San Diego police shooting aftermath: 'You came and killed him\u2019 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Facebook Live / Rumbie Mubaiwa, NBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57eb8fc8e4b01b56deffc299\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/28/160928Shootingaftermathnew_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/28/160928Shootingaftermathnew.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/28/160928Shootingaftermathnew_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/28/san-diego-police-shooting-aftermath-you-came-and-killed-him-video\">San Diego police shooting aftermath: \u2018You came and killed him\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>But he did say that while the department tries to send out officers who have had specialized mental health training to handle such calls, none were available, so the two officers were sent instead. </p> <p>Wells said he was concerned that it took police an hour to respond to the report and that Olango was shot dead a minute after officers arrived, according to the Associated Press. </p> <p>Dozens of protesters took to the streets on Tuesday in response to the shooting, and more took to the streets on Wednesday to demand the release of the video, occupying a freeway underpass.</p> <p>The most recent lawsuit against Gonsalves, which was filed in August, describes sexual harassment against an officer who worked under his supervision, Christine Greer. </p> <p>The harassment, the complaint alleges, included sending her texts like \u201cU will never meet a more discreet or uncomplicated fuck buddy [sic]\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m drunk ant I want u! [sic]\u201d as well as pictures of his genitals via text message.</p> <p>The other suit, filed in 2015 by Greer, alleges that Gonsalves also harassed other female officers in the department. That suit was settled. Both suits allege that the city was told about Gonsalves\u2019s behavior but failed to act to stop him. </p> <p>The August complaint was filed supplementally against Gonsalves and also against the city of El Cajon for failure to prevent Gonsalves\u2019s harassment and for retaliation Greer experienced after the first suit. The second suit also alleges that Gonsalves did all of this despite knowing that Greer was \u201ca sexual assault survivor who suffered from PTSD\u201d.</p> <p>According to court documents, Olango came to the US from Uganda with his family as refugees in 1991, when he was 12. The family then settled in California.<br></p> <p>Agnes Hassan, a refugee from Sudan, told reporters that she and Olango had been in a refugee camp together. \u201cWe suffered so much with the war in Africa, we come here to suffer again,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Both the El Cajon police department and the El Cajon police officers\u2019 association, the police union, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</p>"
