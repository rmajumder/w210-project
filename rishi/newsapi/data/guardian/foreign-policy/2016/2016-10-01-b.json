  "<p>El Cajon police have released video of the police shooting of Alfred Olango, an unarmed black man whose killing on Tuesday prompted days of protests in the San Diego suburb.</p> <p>Olango was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/police-killing-black-man-el-cajon-san-diego-protest\">shot and killed on Tuesday</a> after police confronted the 38-year-old behind a Mexican restaurant with reports that he was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cityofelcajon.us/Home/Components/News/News/2867/112\">not acting like himself</a>\u201d and walking into traffic. In their initial account, police said that Olango refused to comply with commands by police to pull his hand from his pocket.<br></p> <p>He then \u201crapidly drew an object from his front pants pocket\u201d, according to police, \u201cplaced both hands together and extended them rapidly toward the officer taking up what appeared to be a shooting stance\u201d.</p> <p>Two officers, Richard Gonzalves and Josh McDaniel, fired a gun and Taser respectively, El Cajon\u2019 police chief, Jeff Davis, said. They later revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/police-say-black-man-killed-by-officer-near-san-diego-was-holding-e-cigarette\">Olango was holding an e-cigarette</a>. \u201cThe investigation is still continuing,\u201d Davis said, \u201cthis video is part of the evidence and that is why it was vital we show it today.\u201d</p> <p>The videos, taken from a surveillance camera by a drive-through and the cellphone of a witness, shows Olango pacing in the street as an officer confronts him and mirrors his movements. Olango eventually pauses and makes a gesture that is difficult to interpret from a distance. Officers fire, and in the witness\u2019s video a woman screams.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/police-killing-black-man-el-cajon-san-diego-protest\">Police killing of unarmed black man near San Diego sparks protest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe decision to release the video,\u201d Davis said, \u201cwas not made in a vacuum.\u201d Davis said that after the shooting, people were spreading \u201cmisleading\u201d information that \u201chad the potential to create unrest in the community\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was because of this that I decided to release a still image of the video that you\u2019re about to see,\u201d Davis said.</p> <p>The San Diego district attorney, Bonnie Dumanis, said investigators had not reached any conclusions about the case or potential charges. \u201cVideo evidence is one piece of the evidence that is out there, but we want to make sure that we have every bit of the evidence.\u201d</p> <p>Several hundred protesters took to the streets in the days after the shooting, and on Thursday night several dozen people blocked roads, broke car windows and knocked a motorcyclist off his vehicle, according to the police department.<br></p> <p>When told to disperse by police, protesters threw glass bottles, bricks and rocks, and officers used pepperball projectiles on demonstrators, <a href=\"http://www.cityofelcajon.us/Home/Components/News/News/2873/112\">the department said</a>. Two men, 19 and 28, were taken into custody for unlawful assembly, Davis said, and one was arrested for assault on a police officer after a brick was thrown.</p> <p>The night before, one person was injured in demonstrations that turned violent, <a href=\"http://www.cityofelcajon.us/Home/Components/News/News/2869/112\">according to police</a>, and a cameraman from the San Diego Union-Tribune was assaulted. Davis said the camera has since been recovered. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2421c4f7a7df59cfab0eee7a587f4b2ad0ca51c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2421c4f7a7df59cfab0eee7a587f4b2ad0ca51c2/0_0_4896_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protester holds up her fist toward a line of sheriff\u2019s deputies during a protest in El Cajon on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester holds up her fist toward a line of sheriff\u2019s deputies during a protest in El Cajon on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hayne Palmour IV/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFrom the beginning our position has been to allow the demonstrations and protests to go forth as long as they were peaceful and non-violent,\u201d Davis said. \u201cBusinesses are closing, schools are releasing students from classes prematurely,\u201d he added, explaining the decision to release the video.</p> <p>Also at the press conference the Rev Gerald Brown, a local organizer, urged people to protest peacefully. \u201cWe want to move forward in peace. It is OK to protest but we want folks to protest in peace,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A fourth night of protests on Friday remained peaceful at least for the first few hours, with about 200 people blocking intersections and at one point attempting to walk on to a freeway before police stopped them.</p> <p>Several hundred people gathered peacefully at a park in downtown El Cajon on Saturday, to hear speeches by religious leaders and then march through the streets to police headquarters, where family members joined them.</p> <p>Olango\u2019s father, Richard Olango Abuka, called for the resignation of the police chief and said his son\u2019s death would be a turning point in a peaceful struggle to change police practices. Other speakers demanded changes in how police respond to calls about people in mental distress. A modest police presence attended, to direct traffic.</p> <p>On Friday Brown and Andre Branch, president of the NAACP San Diego branch, praised police and the mayor. \u201cWe want to applaud and commend Chief Jeff Davis and the city of El Cajon for releasing this video of this police involved shooting,\u201d Branch said. \u201cThe NAACP believes this is the action that should follow any and all police-involved shootings.\u201d</p> <p>Olango\u2019s mother told reporters that her son, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-alfred-olango-pamela-benge-20160929-snap-story.html\">a Ugandan refugee</a> who arrived in the US in 1991, was in distress because of a friend\u2019s recent death. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities told the Associated Press on Thursday that ICE had tried to deport Olango for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/El-Cajon-Police-Shooting-US-Tried-to-Deport-Slain-Refugee-Twice-395289321.html\">a drug and firearm conviction</a>, but failed to convince Uganda to accept him.
