  "<p>Staged at the United Nations headquarters in New York and performed by disabled musicians, the Beautiful Concert \u2013 in honor of the 10th anniversary of the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml\">Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities</a> \u2013 aimed for an air of sedate harmony. </p> <p>Following one violinist\u2019s meditation from the French opera<strong> </strong>Tha\u00efs and a pianist\u2019s performance of Beethoven\u2019s Mondschien, up rolled Namel \u201cTapwaterz\u201d Norris and Ricardo \u201cRickfire\u201d Velasquez. They grabbed mics, waited for the bass to echo through the sonorous arena and from their wheelchairs started rapping Welcome to Reality. </p> <p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re rough, you think you tough, you think you\u2019re bad as me \u2026 keep it up and you\u2019ll be sitting down like me,\u201d exhorted the duo, known as <a href=\"http://4wheelcity.com/pages/\">4 Wheel City</a>. \u201cMr can\u2019t think, read or write, Mr one to carry guns \u2019cause you can\u2019t fight ... You living life the wrong way \u2026 I ain\u2019t trying to play, trying to open up your eyes before you end up in jail or paralyzed.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48Sf1d02-Yc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/48Sf1d02-Yc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Even at the UN, 4 Wheel City pulled no punches. \u201cWe have two sides to what we do, and we try to do them both with the same mission, the same purpose,\u201d says Norris, when I catch up with him at the 4 Wheel City booth during a recent New York street fair to mark the 25th anniversary of the <a href=\"http://www.pacer.org/parent/504/?gclid=Cj0KEQjw88q9BRDB5qLcwLXr7_sBEiQAZsGjazJTbcAJ9Of7Gjwnt1vw5XzNuZfhG1z8nbpIsEuWo94aAoT78P8HAQ\">Americans with Disabilities Act</a>. \u201cWe do music to inspire people and we do music to plant seeds. Youth need checkpoints and references when they\u2019re in trouble. If a kid says: \u2018I\u2019m not going to touch my gun today, because those guys told our class their story and their story\u2019s crazy,\u2019 then we\u2019ve done our job.\u201d</p> <p>During a long-looming crisis over gun violence in America, in which 7,845 people have been killed and 16,372 people injured in the first six months of 2016, 4 Wheel City are a vital voice. Prior to their mid-June UN appearance, the group performed their song Mainstream \u2013 whose lyrics draw the link between disability and poverty \u2013 at the White House, released a 10-year anniversary album, shot a gun violence prevention video and finished a spring tour of disability expos and arts festivals.</p> <p>Their message seems particularly timely when gun control and the shooting of unarmed black men by the police are matters of national urgency. \u201cWe feel like we beat everyone to the punch years ago,\u201d Velasquez says. \u201cWe had a meeting with the police a few weeks ago, before any of the recent violence started. We don\u2019t have to be reactionary \u2013 they\u2019re catching up to us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"587fcaea94ddaa1cc0d0a5a7dbee6fd5cd2dc1bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/587fcaea94ddaa1cc0d0a5a7dbee6fd5cd2dc1bc/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"4 Wheel City perform at the United Nations.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">4 Wheel City perform at the United Nations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Brune</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At 17, Norris, an avid basketball player and aspiring rapper, was accidentally shot by his cousin and paralyzed. His mother approached Velasquez, by then a paraplegic of three years after being struck in the street by a stray bullet, outside their Bronx housing complex and asked him to befriend her son. Norris says he \u201cwas looking for that light at the end of the tunnel after everything had been taken away.</p> <p>\u201cI had already seen that guy in a wheelchair who looked like me, and I figured we would have to have that conversation, but I didn\u2019t want to confront the real world.\u201d A few weeks later \u2013 prompted by his mother \u2013 Norris turned up at Velasquez\u2019s door as he was \u201cthrowing some beats\u201d on a drum machine. Instead of discussing their disabilities or their traumas, the two men started a conversation about the hip-hop business.</p> <p>Within a few months they launched 4 Wheel records, with Velasquez producing Norris as a solo artist. Following two albums, in 2006 Norris finished his degree at Lehman College and the pair started the non-profit 4 Wheel City. Their mission: \u201cguns down, four\u2019s up\u201d, illustrated by four fingers which stand for a pledge to \u201cinspire, educate, advocate, and entertain\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhere we come from, people don\u2019t talk things out \u2013 they shoot it out, they fight it out, and they end up in wheelchairs or dead,\u201d Norris said. \u201cThe problem is the mentality of young people in the community that I come from wanting to be tough. Back in the day it used to be bats or knives, but guns are so easily available. And if you have a gun it\u2019s like you\u2019re cool and you\u2019re bad.\u201d</p> <p>Velasquez feels a bit differently. \u201cI hate guns,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to get rid of all of them. But what are people using them for? They want to shoot somebody and they miss their target. That\u2019s what happened to me. I\u2019m sitting here, and I had nothing to do with guns.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbQ8YdVwakA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tbQ8YdVwakA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>4 Wheel City</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Besides touring and making records, 4 Wheel City runs two core programs: Welcome 2 Reality, a school series in which Norris and Velasquez deliver motivational talks and rap montages to encourage teenagers to stay in school and away from guns; and Rap Therapy, which are inspirational and instructional hip-hop concerts at rehabilitation hospitals. </p> <p>\u201cI was immediately drawn to their talent and positive mission to use hip hop to spread awareness about gun violence and its relationship to disability \u2013 their unique perspective and musical talent was something I had never seen before,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/nyregion/how-victor-calise-disabilities-commissioner-spends-his-sundays.html\">Victor Calise</a>, the commissioner of New York City mayor Bill De Blasio\u2019s office for people with disabilities, who met the men at New York\u2019s Mount Sinai hospital, where they had both received treatment. \u201cEspecially for people with disabilities, the members of 4-Wheel City show that when you work hard enough at your dreams, you can accomplish anything \u2013 no matter the restrictions and expectations society may impose on you.\u201d</p> <p>The men, assisted solely by Norris\u2019 cousin and sponsored by the New York City chapter of United Spinal Association, have nonetheless largely created their own success from rhyme to recording. \u201cNo one was coming to give us a record deal, so we decided to go out and do our own thing \u2013 be our own bosses,\u201d said Velasquez, the more muted point-man to Norris.</p> <p>Despite their challenges, the men are starting to reach their intended audience. Early successes included appearances at VH1\u2019s Hip Hop Honors Awards in 2006, nominations for an Underground Music award, a <a href=\"http://realeconomicimpact.tumblr.com/post/134865024135/hip-hop-duo-pushes-to-get-more-americans-with\">50 Unsung Heroes designation from the New York Daily News</a> and the opportunity to work with Snoop Dogg on a remix of Welcome to Reality. Still, as Velasquez points out, \u201cwe\u2019re the only act that has accomplished so much and not received a call from a record producer\u201d.</p> <p>He adds: \u201cI think most people look at us and don\u2019t believe two guys in wheelchairs can do what we do. You might see some musicians with disabilities, but it\u2019s not usually a black person. That\u2019s what I thought before I was in a wheelchair. But how can someone have a vision of something they\u2019ve never experienced before? So we just keep going and proving them wrong.\u201d</p> <p>As the sun bears down on Mott Street and a Chinese singer wraps up the afternoon with a traditional prosperity song, Velasquez and Norris gather their CDs and T-shirts and make their way up to the Access-A-Ride pickup point four blocks north. As Norris carries the plastic boxes in his lap and films the surroundings with a DSLR camera, Velasquez hitches a ride by grabbing the back handle of his partner\u2019s electric wheelchair. Along the way, the men stop, listen to their surroundings for inspiration and banter. </p> <p>\u201cI used to think that you do something and it will propel you to where you want to be in life \u2013 I hit those checkpoints and I\u2019ll win that Grammy,\u201d Norris said.</p> <p>\u201cNow we just work and don\u2019t look back,\u201d Velasquez adds. \u201cInstead of being, we just want to be doing.\u201d </p>"
