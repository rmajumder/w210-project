  "<p>New York police department officials have conceded that something went wrong in the lead-up to a sergeant fatally shooting a mentally ill 66-year-old black woman in her own home in the Bronx Tuesday night.</p> <p> \u201cWhat is clear in this one instance, we failed,\u201d police chief James O\u2019Neill told reporters Wednesday morning. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it\u2019s supposed to go. It\u2019s not how we train.\u201d</p> <p>The woman, Deborah Danner, had schizophrenia and police had visited her home on prior occasions for disturbances. According to police, they were responding to a call from a neighbor that Danner was acting in an \u201cirrational manner\u201d when the shooting occurred.</p> <p>Danner was holding a pair of scissors when sergeant Hugh Barry entered her residence, police said. Barry was able to convince Danner to put down the scissors and leave the home with him when she allegedly picked up a bat and began swinging it at the Sergeant\u2019s head.</p> <p>Barry fired two shots from his service weapon, and Danner was taken to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead.</p> <p>Police said that Barry was equipped with a less-lethal Taser weapon, which he did not deploy. Barry has been placed on modified duty, and was stripped of his gun and badge while the incident is investigated by the NYPD\u2019s force investigation division.</p> <p>Mayor Bill de Blasio called the shooting \u201ctragic and unacceptable\u201d in a Wednesday evening press conference, adding \u201cit should never have happened. It\u2019s as simple as that: it should never have happened.\u201d The mayor also commended the department for moving quickly to reassign the sergeant. </p> <p>That move was ridiculed by Barry\u2019s union, the NYPD sergeants benevolent association. President Ed Mullins called the shooting justified and said the decision to strip Barry of his badge was \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d.</p> <p>After what his office called a \u201crigorous review\u201d, New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman announced on Thursday that his office would not be reviewing the shooting, and that it would be left to the Bronx county district attorney to decide whether a crime had been committed. Schneiderman said that because Danner had a weapon, the incident fell outside of his authority to investigate. An executive order signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo after the death of Eric Garner gives the attorney general\u2019s office the responsibly to make determinations about fatal police incidents in cases where the victim is unarmed. </p> <p>Bronx borough president Ruben Diaz Jr called the incident \u201call too reminiscent\u201d of the case of Eleanor Bumpurs, a Bronx woman, who like Danner was 66 and dealing with mental health issues, who <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/13/nyregion/state-judge-dismisses-indictment-of-officer-in-the-bumpurs-killing.html?pagewanted=all\">was killed by NYPD officers in 1984.</a> The officer in that case was charged with manslaughter and eventually acquitted.</p> <p>\u201cWhile I certainly understand the hard work our police officers undertake to keep the streets of our city safe every single day, I also know what excessive force looks like,\u201d Diaz said in a statement.</p> <p>The shooting highlights the danger that people with mental health issues often face when they become involved with police during moments of crisis. The Guardian\u2019s long-term investigation into police killings has found that, nationwide, more than a quarter of all killings involve individuals with mental health issues. </p> <p>Danner is the seventh person described as \u201cemotionally disturbed\u201d to be killed by NYPD officers in the last three years, according to the New York advocacy group Communities United for Police Reform.<br></p> <p>\u201cNo person in need of mental health services should end up dying like this,\u201d said Donna Liebman, executive director of the New York ACLU. \u201cThe questions raised by such a disproportionate use of force are especially important in a context where across the country people are asking if law enforcement values enough the lives of people of color.\u201d </p> <p> Danner is the 10th black woman to be killed by police in 2016 and the first since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/02/korryn-gaines-black-woman-killed-by-police-son-injured\">Korryn Gaines was killed by officers</a> in Baltimore in a high-profile August incident. </p>",

Perhaps he had been stringing Leyonhjelm along, hoping to keep the senator in the tent as a likely \u201cyes\u201d on the ABCC legislation until the government had swung the three NXT senators and the four One Nation senators to its side. With seven votes plus the likely support of the new Family First senator, maybe Turnbull thought Leyonhjelm would get drop his gun demands and get with the momentum rather than stand in its way.</p> <p>Turnbull has form with this style of negotiation. Former prime minister <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-29/rudd-releases-letters-to-turnbull-on-un-secretary-general-bid/7674038\">Kevin Rudd\u2019s letters</a> paint a picture of Turnbull stringing Rudd along on the question of whether the government would support Rudd\u2019s UN secretary general nomination, letting him believe that support was likely forthcoming but never really committing. As Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor, Katharine Murphy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/29/hurt-feelings-why-did-malcolm-turnbull-send-kevin-rudd-mixed-messages\">pointed out</a>, it seems Turnbull thought he could \u201cwalk both sides of the street\u201d on Rudd\u2019s nomination until after the election \u2013 when Turnbull thought he would be better able to finesse a complex situation off the back of a bigger personal mandate.</p> <p>As the Rudd saga showed, stringing someone along in political negotiations can have dire consequences.

The upper house shutdown was a drastic last step to avert political disaster. But the shutdown became a foul political problem in and of itself: the closed legislative council symbolised a government unable to function.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/18/malcolm-turnbull-gun-control-david-leyonhjelm-labor-unions-senate\">Malcolm Turnbull is too busy explaining to actually tell anyone what he thinks | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A crossbench MP on a single-issue mission can exact a lot of damage, especially when they perceive that the government fails to deal honestly, fairly and openly with him or her.</p> <p>The Coalition government should have figured this out by now. Don\u2019t tell me it can\u2019t be done. My government kept the upper house open and got all our major legislation passed. Julia Gillard\u2019s government, without a majority in either chamber, was incredibly successful in implementing its legislative agenda, with Anthony Albanese playing a key role in negotiating with the crossbench MPs.</p> <p>It\u2019s not rocket science. It starts with respecting that crossbenchers are duly elected MPs with their own mandates and constituencies. It helps to create one direct line of communication between the crossbench MPs and someone with authority to speak on the government\u2019s behalf. The government should be clear on what it will and won\u2019t do, and it should only make deals on which it can deliver.</p> <p>It is somewhat staggering that, after three years in office, the Coalition still hasn\u2019t figured this out. As senator David Leyonhjelm told Sky News yesterday, \u201cIf I am going to deal with the government, I need to be able to trust them. In this situation, you know, I\u2019ve been dudded. How can I trust them in the future, and how can the crossbench in general deal with the government, if you can\u2019t rely on their word?\u201d</p>"
