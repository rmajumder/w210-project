  "<p>Another year, another shooting of an unarmed black man by a Tulsa police officer, another protest.</p> <p>\u201cWe could not just sit down and see this happen once again in our city and not say anything,\u201d said Marq Lewis, founder of We The People Oklahoma. </p> <p>The activist group led calls for change when Robert Bates killed Eric Harris last year and channelled community anger again on Tuesday as about 300 people gathered peacefully to demand the firing and prosecution of Betty Shelby, a white Tulsa city police officer who shot Terence Crutcher dead last Friday.</p> <p>What on the face of it should have been a routine event \u2013 an officer responding to a report of a broken-down vehicle \u2013 went rapidly and horrifically askew, a death recorded on graphic video that pinged around the planet on social media and was cited by everybody from local protesters to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">presidential candidate</a><br>as yet more evidence of the intersection of systemic racism and police brutality.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/20/tulsa-shooting-helicopter-footage-shows-victim-unarmed-and-walking-away-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53zbm\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2734069\"            data-video-name=\"Tulsa shooting: helicopter footage shows victim unarmed and walking away \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e0dbe5e4b02fcdee725df4\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/20/160920TulsaShooting1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/20/160920TulsaShooting1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/20/160920TulsaShooting1_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/20/tulsa-shooting-helicopter-footage-shows-victim-unarmed-and-walking-away-video\">Dash cam and police helicopter footage of police shooting in Tulsa, Oklahoma</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just sad \u2013 but we need accountability,\u201d Lewis said before he addressed a chanting crowd that crammed on to the steps outside the downtown police headquarters, a towel perched on his right shoulder so he could wipe away the sweat that dripped as he spoke on a sweltering evening in the state\u2019s second-biggest city.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/20/tulsa-sheriff-training-documents-missing-for-officer-in-fatal-shooting\">Tulsa officers 'don't want this case to be about race', Eric Harris family says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After a year of pressure, We The People saw a rare outcome earlier this year in the case of Bates, a \u201cpay to play\u201d volunteer Tulsa County sheriff\u2019s deputy who shot dead Harris, an African American man, during a sting operation in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cHe shot me!\u201d Harris cries in video footage. \u201cOh my God, I\u2019m losing my breath.\u201d In an hour he would be dead. \u201cFuck your breath,\u201d one of the officers replies.</p> <p>Then aged 73, Bates was a friend of the sheriff, Stanley Glanz, and had made large donations to the department. The former insurance executive said that he meant to use a Taser but reached for his gun by mistake. He was convicted of manslaughter last April and sentenced to four years in prison. Glanz <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/robert-bates-imprisoned-tulsa-reserve-deputy-speaks-jail-cell-n587161\">resigned last year</a>.</p> <p>The results were a major victory for Lewis and his fellow activists, given how rarely officers who discharge their weapons are charged with a crime, let alone convicted. But with Bates only four months into his sentence, Tulsa is again in the national spotlight because of a single bullet fired at an unarmed man.</p> <p>Shelby, 42, a five-year veteran of the department who was previously with the sheriff\u2019s office, arrived to find an apparently abandoned SUV in the middle of a two-lane road six miles north-east of downtown Tulsa at about 7.45pm last Friday.</p> <p>Dashcam video shows Crutcher walking away from Shelby towards the left side of his SUV with his hands in the air as three more officers arrive and approach.

That big bad dude was enrolled at Tulsa Community College, just wanting to make us proud. That big bad dude loved God. That big bad dude was at church singing, with all of his flaws, every week. That big bad dude, that\u2019s who he was.\u201d</p> <p>Arlando Jasper heard the news on Saturday, his 36th birthday. It is 15 years since he first met Crutcher in a chance encounter on the street. \u201cHe saw me and said: \u2018God told me to take you wherever you want to go.\u2019 I didn\u2019t even know the man, but there was something about him that made me comfortable. He just offered me a lift, he took me all the way from north Tulsa to south Tulsa \u2026 and he didn\u2019t know who I was,\u201d said Jasper, a pastor. They kept in contact.</p> <p>Crutcher came from a family of gospel musicians. The last time he saw Jasper, a couple of months ago, he suggested they get together and create some gospel tracks. \u201cHe\u2019s the kind of person that always wanted you laughing, he\u2019s a jokester to his heart, when people are around him he\u2019s going to make sure everybody\u2019s having a good time. He\u2019s not having a good time unless everybody else is.

Some at Tuesday\u2019s demonstration referred to the lingering effects of the race riot of 1921, which saw as many as <a href=\"http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/7/19/survivors-of-infamous1921tulsaraceriotstillhopeforjustice.html\">300 people killed</a> as the city\u2019s relatively prosperous African American neighbourhood was wrecked.</p> <p>Six years ago the city opened Reconciliation Park to commemorate the riot. It includes a statue of a black man with his arms raised in surrender. Some 95 years on from the terrible violence, several protesters on Tuesday wore T-shirts with the slogan \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d, and lamented that though Crutcher held his arms aloft, the submissive gesture did not save his life in 2016.</p> <p>\u201cI just dropped my aunt off, and I had to wonder,\u201d Jasper said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t worried about whether or not I was going to get shot in the \u2019hood, whether I was going to get robbed; I had to wonder whether or not the police were going to pull me over and do something to me.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2>Protesters clash with police in Charlotte</h2> <p>Twelve police officers were injured in overnight disturbances in Charlotte, North Carolina, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/protesters-clash-with-police-in-charlotte-after-fatal-shooting-of-black-man\">after protesters clashed with police</a> following the fatal police shooting of a black man earlier in the day. Keith Scott, 43, was shot and killed by Charlotte-Mecklenburg officer Brentley Vinson, who is also black, after being mistaken for a wanted man. Police say Scott, a father of seven, brandished a gun as he got out of a car; his family insist he was sitting in his car reading a book and had no gun. In a video posted to Facebook Live, Scott\u2019s daughter Lyric can be heard yelling at investigators not to plant a weapon in Scott\u2019s car. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what the fuck y\u2019all do,\u201d she said.

Scott, a father of seven, was pronounced dead at Carolinas Medical Center.</p> <p>The police version is at odds with that of Scott\u2019s family who have insisted that he was disabled, sitting in his car reading a book, and had no gun. \u201cHe sits in the shade, reads his book and waits on his kid to get off the bus,\u201d Scott\u2019s sister told reporters. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have no gun, he wasn\u2019t messing with nobody.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a1529544c125a312463ab82512f790d4506002b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a1529544c125a312463ab82512f790d4506002b/0_0_3474_2083/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protestors demonstrate in front of police officers wearing riot gear after police fatally shot Keith Lamont Scott in the parking lot of an apartment complex in Charlotte, North Carolina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters demonstrate in front of police officers wearing riot gear after police fatally shot Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte, North Carolina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFRIbmUb83U\">video posted to Facebook Live from the scene</a>, Scott\u2019s daughter Lyric can be heard yelling at investigators on the scene not to plant a weapon in Scott\u2019s car. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what the fuck y\u2019all do,\u201d she said. </p> <p>As protests swelled on Tuesday night, police used teargas in an attempt to disperse crowds heard yelling \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d and \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot!\u201d One person held up a sign saying \u201cStop killing us\u201d; another sign said: \u201cIt was a book\u201d.</p> <p>In statements, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police department <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CMPD/status/778432107987296256\">distinguished between \u201cagitators\u201d and \u201cdemonstrators\u201d</a>, blaming the former for damaging police vehicles and causing injuries to at least a dozen officers.
