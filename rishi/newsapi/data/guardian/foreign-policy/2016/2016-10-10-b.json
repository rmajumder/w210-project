  "<h2>Donald Trump\u2019s claims</h2> <h2><strong><br>\u2018The US is giving back $150bn to a terrorist state\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The US is not giving any of its own money to Iran as part of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/iran-nuclear-deal-expected-to-be-announced-in-vienna\">international nuclear arms deal</a> meant to prevent the construction of weapons. The deal <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/statements/iaea-director-general%E2%80%99s-statement-iran\">gradually unfreezes assets</a> that belong to Iran but were frozen under sanctions related to the nation\u2019s nuclear programme. Sanctions related to human rights, terrorism and other issues remain in place and still lock Iran out of billions.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s guess of how much Iran will benefit by unfrozen assets is far higher than most experts\u2019 estimates, though not inconceivable. Treasury secretary Jack Lew has <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?327246-1/secretaries-kerry-moniz-lew-testimony-iran-nuclear-agreement\">put the number at $56bn</a>; Iranian officials have said between <a href=\"http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2016/01/19/446415/Iran-32bn-unfrozen-assets\">$32bn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-claims-100-billion-now-freed-in-major-step-as-sanctions-roll-back/2016/02/01/edfc23ca-c8e5-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html\">$100bn</a>. Independent economists have calculated that Iran will free up anything <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-iran-frozen-assets-20160120-story.html\">between $30bn to $100bn</a>. Complicating the calculations are Iran\u2019s debts: it will have to pay off tens of billions to countries <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/world/getting-china-sanction-iran/p24212\">such as China</a>.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Just today, policemen were shot, two killed, and this is happening on a weekly basis\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Two police officers were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/three-police-officers-shot-palm-springs-california\">shot dead on Saturday in Palm Springs.</a></p> <p>Trump\u2019s claim is only one slice of a much larger story that does not support his argument. His campaign cited <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/causes.html\">data from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund</a> (NLEOMF), which does show <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/\">a 56% increase</a> in officers killed by guns between 1 January and 16 July 2016 (28) compared with the same span in 2015 (18). But according to the non-profit group, officer deaths overall, including from traffic accidents and job-related illnesses, are roughly on par with figures from this point in 2015: 60 deaths this year to 61 the year before.</p> <p>The non-profit\u2019s data also shows that police fatalities overall <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/year.html?referrer=http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/\">have declined</a> in the last 15 years: in the last seven years of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency theaverage number of police deaths was 135, , a 17% decline on the final seven years of George W Bush\u2019s administration, when there were an average of 162 a year. Gun deaths have declined, though only slightly, between the administrations. Police fatalities have in general declined in the last 40 years: from 1991 to 2000, an average of 162 officers were killed each year; from 1981 to 1990, an average of 186; from 1971 to 1980, an average of 230.</p> <p>The deadliest era for police in the US was prohibition. In the years between its enactment and repeal, from 1920 to 1933, an average of 250 officers were killed each year. Gun-related deaths were <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/research-bulletins/?referrer=http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/causes.html?referrer=http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/year.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/\">highest in 1973</a>, according to the NLEOMF figures, when 156 officers were killed.</p> <p>The FBI also <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2014-statistics-on-law-enforcement-officers-killed-and-assaulted\">reports</a> police deaths with information submitted to it from various law enforcement agencies, though its most recent figures date from 2014. According to such data, that year 96 law enforcement officers were killed, 51 by \u201cfelonious acts\u201d and 45 in accidents, and 48,315 officers were assaulted while on duty. Forty-six of the officers were killed by guns; 28 died in car accidents. Almost 80% of assaults were by people using their hands and feet. The last four years of Bush\u2019s presidency and the first four of Obama\u2019s recorded <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/leoka/2014/tables/table_29_leos_fk_type_of_weapon_2005-2014.xls\">about the same number of gun-related police deaths</a>, according to this data, with about 46 a year.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I did not say that \u2026 it\u2019s locker room talk\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Trump did say that he would \u201cgrab [women] by the pussy\u201d, and was recorded saying so in 2005 in a video published by the Washington Post on Friday.</p> <p>Pressed by moderator Anderson Cooper, he did admit to having made the comment, though he then said he had never actually acted in the way. He was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\">accused of \u201cattempted rape\u201d in the 1990s</a>, though never convicted.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/09/donald-trump-video-apologizes-groping-tape-locker-room-talk-debate\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56n3m\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2792173\"            data-video-name=\"Trump 'very embarrassed' by 2005 groping remarks on tape \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fafab7e4b0e4aaeaa8db63\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/10/161010Trumplewd2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/10/161010Trumplewd2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11939157&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/09/donald-trump-video-apologizes-groping-tape-locker-room-talk-debate\">Trump \u2018very embarrassed\u2019 by 2005 groping remarks on tape</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>\u2018The inner-cities of our country, which are a disaster, education-wise, job-wise, safety-wise\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Trump\u2019s repeated claim that inner cities are a \u201cdisaster\u201d or \u201chell\u201d defies most of American history.

In 2015, black people earned just 75% as much as whites in median hourly earnings, whether full- or part-time, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/\">according to a Pew Research</a> analysis. The black unemployment rate in <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t02.htm\">August 2016 was 8.1%</a>, compared with 4.4% for white people, but still lower than for <a href=\"http://www.macrotrends.net/2524/black-unemployment-rate-history-chart\">most of the last 40 years.</a> Life expectancy of African American has increased from the mid-30s around 1900 to the mid-70s in 2016, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db244.htm\">according to the CDC</a>.

Hillary Clinton attacked those same women, four of those women are here tonight \u2026 She\u2019s seen laughing on two occasions, laughing at rape\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Trump is referring to <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/politics/the-hillary-tapes/\">audio</a> from the early 1980s in which Clinton, then running a legal aid clinic in Arkansas, jokes with a reporter about the legal system in the context of a rape case she <a href=\"https://www.americancrossroads.org/2008/06/election-2008-young-clinton-case-clashing-ideals/\">she had been assigned by a judge</a> to take. In the recording, she laughs about the accuracy of polygraphs, access to evidence and the judge\u2019s discomfort with the discussing the case before her. She also calls the case \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cfascinating\u201d. In one of her <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743222253/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_2?pf_rd_p=1944687542&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0307388557&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=181YZ4E5AMQY35TRFPRH\">memoirs</a> she says she felt uncomfortable being assigned the case. The case against her client eventually collapsed, and charges were <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/229667084/State-of-Arkansas-V-Thomas-Alfred-Taylor#fullscreen\">reduced</a> to unlawful fondling of a minor. In 2014, the victim <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/20/exclusive-hillary-clinton-took-me-through-hell-rape-victim-says.html\">told the Daily Beast</a>: \u201cHillary Clinton took me through hell.\u201d</p> <p>According to diaries by a friend of Clinton, she called Monica Lewinsky a \u201cnarcissistic loony toon\u201d, albeit in private. According to the New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/03/us/politics/hillary-bill-clinton-women.html\">the Clinton campaign hired a private investigator</a> to find material to tarnish Gennifer Flowers\u2019 reputation. Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in the investigation is not clear, but in June 1992 she said on the Arsenio Hall Show that Flowers had \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0CS8uvegg\">got lots of problems</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Trump joked about sexual assault in the 2005 video released by the Washington Post on Friday, saying that he believed fame gave him the right to \u201cgrab [women] by the pussy\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Bill Clinton \u2018had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones who is here tonight\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Paula Jones was an Arkansas state employee who alleged that Bill Clinton, while he was governor in 1991, exposed himself in a sexual advance on her. In 1994 she sued him for sexual harassment, but a federal judge dismissed the case on the grounds that even if her allegations were true (at least <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=wzQgOuIm8RgC&amp;pg=RA1-PT319&amp;lpg=RA1-PT319&amp;dq=clinton+doctors+distinguishing+characteristic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YF9lnMjvwm&amp;sig=k1xwK9IQLAXUaB57t0OnLk3w314&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjL2d-86JHKAhWMOCYKHQiJC4wQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=clinton%20doctors%20distinguishing%20characteristic&amp;f=false\">one of her claims was found false</a>) the behaviour did not constitute sexual harassment under the law\u2019s definition of it. Jones appealed, and in 1998 Clinton <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/13/us/clinton-settles-jones-lawsuit-with-a-check-for-850000.html\">settled for $850,000</a> without admission of guilt or apology.</p> <p>In a deposition for that suit, Clinton denied having sexual relations with White House intern Monica Lewinsky \u2013 a falsehood that led to his eventual impeachment trial, in which <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/13/us/president-s-acquittal-overview-clinton-acquitted-decisively-no-majority-for.html\">he was acquitted by the Senate in 1999</a>.</p> <p>In 1998, Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/05/24/trumps-flip-flop-on-whether-the-bill-clinton-sex-scandals-are-important/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_trump-clinton-9pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&amp;tid=a_inl\">called</a> Paula Jones a \u201closer\u201d in an interview<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/09/politics/trump-clinton-sex-then-vs-now/index.html\"> uncovered by CNN</a>, and told <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/05/02/donald-trump-in-1998-bill-clinton-is-a-victim-of-unattractive-women.html\">Fox News</a> that she and other accusers \u201care terrible\u201d and Clinton \u201che is really a victim himself. But he put himself in that position.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a really unattractive group. I\u2019m not just talking about physical,\u201d he said.</p> <h2><strong>Clinton\u2019s campaign and Sidney Blumenthal started the birther conspiracy</strong></h2> <p>There is no evidence that Clinton or her campaign had anything to do with the false rumours that Barack Obama was not born in the United States, nor did Clinton have anything to do with the five years Donald Trump spent questioning Obama\u2019s citizenship and religion. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign has tried to blame several people who were tangentially related to the Clinton campaign, if at all. A former aide named Mark Penn wrote a <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/4097983/Penn-Strategy-Memo-3-19-07#fullscreen&amp;from_embed\">2007 memo</a> that Obama\u2019s \u201clack of American roots\u201d could \u201chold him back\u201d. But he added: \u201cWe are never going to say anything about his background.\u201d The Clinton campaign <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/09/the-front-runner-s-fall/306944/\">never</a> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2008/08/clinton-told-to-portray-obama-as-foreign-012420\">acted</a> on Penn\u2019s advice and he <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/07/us/politics/07hillary.html\">was dismissed</a> in April 2008.</p> <p>Sidney Blumenthal, an old friend of the Clintons who frequently sent them unsolicited advice, <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article102354777.html\">reportedly asked reporters </a>to investigate Obama\u2019s birth. He has denied this and denounced the conspiracy.</p> <h2>Tr<strong>ump: \u2018She wants to go to single-payer healthcare\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Clinton has not proposed a wholesale shift to a single-player system, as Bernie Sanders urged throughout the Democratic primary. She has, however, proposed an <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/14/politics/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all/\">expansion of the government program</a> to include tax credits and reduced prescription drug costs.</p> <h2><strong>Barack Obama and the architect of the Affordable Care Act lied: \u2018The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn\u2019t work\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Obama admitted in 2013 that his policy slogan, \u201cIf you like your healthcare<strong> </strong>plan, you can keep it\u201d, was false. Politifact named it \u201c<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/dec/12/lie-year-if-you-like-your-health-care-plan-keep-it/\">lie of the year</a>\u201d after millions of insurers cancelled plans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fa138e614f3aba2f2668bfa203a8e9213a4e25b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fa138e614f3aba2f2668bfa203a8e9213a4e25b/0_26_2200_1319/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump reacts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump reacts during the debate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Young/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Muslims have to report suspicion of terrorism, as in San Bernardino</strong></h2> <p>Trump has repeatedly and baselessly said someone saw \u201cbombs on the floor\u201d and \u201csuspicious behaviour\u201d before the mass shooting in California last December \u2013 he has repeated this for weeks without any evidence. Investigators found <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/03/us/syed-farook-tashfeen-malik-mass-shooting-profile/\">pipe bombs and ammunition in a townhouse</a> rented by the couple who carried out the shooting in the Redlands, not near their home, and their landlord has said he had no reason to suspect them. Neighbours also<a href=\"http://abc7.com/news/redlands-home-connected-to-suspects-packed-with-weapons/1107801/\"> expressed surprise and alarm</a>, not concerns about political correctness.</p> <p>One local news station <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/syed-farooks-neighbors-didnt-report-suspicious-activity-for-fear-of-profiling/\">reported</a> on 3 December that Aaron Elswick, a neighbour one of the shooters\u2019 mother, recalled hearing yet another neighbour say, in Elswick\u2019s words: \u201cShe had noticed that they had, I guess, been receiving packages, quite a few packages within a short amount of time. And that they were actually doing a lot of work out in the garage and she was kind of suspicious and was wanting to report it.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I would not have had our people in Iraq because Iraq was a disaster \u2026 </strong><strong>I was against the war in Iraq it has not been debunked\u2019</strong></h2> <p>This is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/trump-fact-check-iraq-war-san-bernardino-nato\">a lie</a>. In the months before the Iraq war began in 2003, Trump tepidly endorsed invasion to <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/buzzfeedandrew/trump-on-the-howard-stern-show-on-sept-11-2002?utm_source=soundcloud&amp;utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">radio host Howard Stern</a>, who asked him whether he thought the US should attack Saddam Hussein. \u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>A few weeks later he told Fox News that George W Bush was \u201cdoing a very good job\u201d. Several weeks after the invasion, Trump told the Washington Post: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/archive/lifestyle/2003/03/25/hollywood-partyers-soldiering-on/06327347-83d3-44c4-ab7b-dcd6fbda5437/?resType=accessibility\">The war\u2019s a mess</a>.\u201d In August 2004, he told <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/interviews/a37230/donald-trump-esquire-cover-story-august-2004/\">Esquire</a>: \u201cTwo minutes after we leave, there\u2019s going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over.\u201d</p> <p>Even in <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/christophermassie/a-guide-to-donald-trump-early-flip-flops-on-the-iraq-war?utm_term=.vq5VjeKwe#.uy2eDvV5v\">the interview</a> cited by the Trump campaign to explain his \u201copposition\u201d, Trump expressed impatience with Bush for not invading sooner. \u201cWhatever happened to the days of the Douglas MacArthur? He would go and attack. He wouldn\u2019t talk.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Hillary Clinton wants to increase refugees by 550%</strong></h2> <p>Trump is correct that Clinton has proposed a 550% increase in refugees, from 10,000 in 2016 to 65,000 in 2017.</p> <p>But this does not add up to \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d, as he says. He appears to have borrowed this figure from an ally, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who <a href=\"http://www.sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2016/6/clinton-refugee-plan-could-bring-in-620-000-refugees-in-first-term-at-lifetime-cost-of-over-400-billion\">invented it.</a> Session falsely claims Clinton would continue to grant asylum to 55,000 Syrian refugees every year in addition to 100,000 refugees from the Middle East in general. Clinton has called for allowing 55,000 refugees from Syria for one year, and has not proposed yearly asylum for 155,000 Middle East refugees for her term.</p> <h2>\u2018<strong>People are coming into our country, like, we have no idea who they are, where they\u2019re from, what their feelings about our country are \u2026 We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love of our country\u2019</strong></h2> <p>This is false. The US has probably the most intensive screening process in the world for refugees: it requires they register and interview with the United Nations, which then must refer them to the US; refugees who pass this test then interview with state department contractors and have at least two background checks; then they have three fingerprint and photo screenings; then US immigration reviews the case; then homeland security interviews the refugee; then a doctor examines the refugee; and finally several security agencies perform one last check after the refugee has been matched with a resettlement agency. </p> <p>The process <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">takes 18 months</a> to two years. The US has a very clear idea about which refugees it allows into the country.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I don\u2019t know Putin \u2026 I know nothing about Russia\u2019</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s not clear whether Trump has ever spoken to the Russian president. Putin was invited to, but did not attend, a 2013 beauty pageant in Moscow, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-trumps-financial-ties-to-russia-and-his-unusual-flattery-of-vladimir-putin/2016/06/17/dbdcaac8-31a6-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html\">one of the oligarchs</a> who helped organise the event. Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/347191326112112640\">wondered</a> beforehand: \u201cWill he become my new best friend?\u201d</p> <p>The pair may have communicated through intermediaries. In 2014, Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKkKQmbyECw\">told a National Press Club luncheon</a>: \u201cI was in Moscow recently and I spoke, indirectly and directly, with President Putin, who could not have been nicer, and we had a tremendous success.\u201d A year earlier, Trump <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-putin-tried-arrange-meeting-moscow-source-n619006\">told MSNBC</a>: \u201cI do have a relationship and I can tell you that he\u2019s very interested in what we\u2019re doing here today.\u201d</p> <p>Last November, Trump <a href=\"http://time.com/4107636/transcript-read-the-full-text-of-the-fourth-republican-debate-in-milwaukee/\">claimed in a debate</a> that he \u201cgot to know [Putin] very well because we were both on 60 Minutes\u201d.

I make this speech voluntarily \u2026 Kadyrov rebuilt this [Kenkhi] village.\u201d </p> <p>He had been told by officials that if he publicly renounced his statement, he would be able to return to Chechnya with his family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Kadyrov's Instagram\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:28.125% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BGCk4xrCRjF/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A video posted by Ramzan Kadyrov (@kadyrov_95)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-05-30T17:45:25+00:00&quot;&gt;May 30, 2016 at 10:45am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>A video posted on Kadyrov\u2019s Instagram account that appears to show Dzhalaldinov apologising. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kadyrov then told his two millions followers on Instagram that \u201csome abnormal forces\u201d had tried to use this man \u201cto achieve their filthy, harmful objectives\u201d but luckily, he \u201cfound the strength and wisdom\u201d to realise his mistake and publicly admit it, so his apology was accepted.</p> <p>Even those who use monikers or talk in closed groups on social media face reprisals. Late last year, a 35-year-old faculty member from a university in Grozny, Khizir Ezhiev, was chatting with friends in a private group on Facebook. When someone mentioned Kadyrov\u2019s pilgrimage to Mecca, Ezhiev wrote: \u201cApparently, all sorts are welcome there these days.\u201d</p> <p>Weeks later, four men bundled Ezhiev into their vehicle and drove away. His body was found weeks later with multiple injuries. Authorities claimed he had fallen off a cliff.</p> <p>The day after Ezhiev was abducted, an unrelated video surfaced of a young man walking on a treadmill in his underwear and apologising to Kadyrov.</p> <p>\u201cI am Adam Dikaev from Avtury village,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWwKZqct8V4\">he said on camera</a>. \u201cThinking that no one can find me, I wrote on Instagram [under another name] what I should not have written. They found me and took my pants down. I realised I am nobody. From now on, Putin is my father, grandfather, and tsar \u2026\u201d<br></p> <p>His crime? Flippant comments on social networks about Kadyrov grovelling before Putin. The video showed Chechens the level of humiliation the government was prepared to orchestrate.</p> <p>Over the past year, many from Chechnya have recounted similar stories, and described sweeping repression, relentless pressure and constant humiliation. Some say the current situation feels more unbearable than the bombing and shelling experienced during the recent war.</p> <p>\u201cWe lived through the war and kept our dignity \u2013 but now they [the authorities] are taking that dignity away from us, and we who survived the war cannot live with it,\u201d said one Grozny resident, speaking on the condition of anonymity.</p> <p><em>Tanya Lokshina is Russia programme director at Human Rights Watch, and author of the report, </em><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/08/30/walking-minefield/vicious-crackdown-critics-russias-chechen-republic\">Like Walking a Minefield: Vicious Crackdown on Critics in Russia\u2019s Chechen Republic</a></p>"
