  "<p>Tony Abbott has challenged Malcolm Turnbull to find \u201canother deregulatory measure\u201d to win the Liberal Democratic party senator David Leyonhjelm\u2019s vote on restoring the building and construction commission and take gun control definitively off the table.<br></p> <p>Abbott told Guardian Australia on Tuesday evening there was \u201cno way on God\u2019s Earth\u201d he would have allowed eight-shot Adler guns to \u201cflood into the country\u201d while he was prime minister.</p> <p>Abbott said he had moved to ban the weapons when he heard the guns were being imported, detecting the \u201canxiety\u201d of police and security agencies \u2013 and the ban had then been subjected to a sunset clause because of what he termed \u201cpushback in the Coalition\u201d \u2013 not because of any agreement with Leyonhjelm on non-related migration legislation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/18/tony-abbott-disturbed-by-reports-turnbull-trading-off-adler-gun-laws-for-abcc-vote\">Tony Abbott 'disturbed' by reports Turnbull trading off Adler gun laws for ABCC vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The intervention from the former prime minister followed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/18/tony-abbott-disturbed-by-reports-turnbull-trading-off-adler-gun-laws-for-abcc-vote\">a sustained effort by Labor to intensify political pressure on the prime minister</a> after Turnbull first appeared to leave open the option of cutting a deal with Leyonhjelm on gun regulation \u2013 which is a pet subject of the libertarian senator \u2013 in return for a positive vote on the government\u2019s legislation restoring the Australian Building and Construction Commission.</p> <p>Turnbull had entered Tuesday with the objective of putting political pressure on the ALP over the ABCC and the party\u2019s links to the trade union movement, but the day quickly became consumed by political controversy over gun control.</p> <p>Shorten moved a parliamentary motion citing reports that Turnbull would \u201cdo a deal on gun laws to pass the Abbott government\u2019s industrial relations bills\u201d, and noting Turnbull \u201chas on at least five occasions just this morning refused to rule out trading away John Howard\u2019s gun laws to pass the Abbott government\u2019s industrial relations bills\u201d.</p> <p>Labor then followed up in question time with a series of questions about the government\u2019s ongoing commitment to gun control.</p> <p>Shorten cited an agreement during the Abbott period where the government introduced a prohibition on the importation of lever action shotguns. The ban was subject to a 12-month sunset clause.</p> <p>Leyonjhelm on Tuesday released correspondence between himself and staff of the justice minister, Michael Keenan, which linked the application of the sunset clause directly to the LDP senator\u2019s vote in favour of non-related migration legislation.</p> <p>Turnbull eventually moved to shut the issue down in parliamentary question time, telling the house there was no prospect of weakening the Howard agreement on gun control.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no prospect, no chance of my government \u2026 weakening, watering down John Howard\u2019s gun laws. And I might say there is no proposal being made to do so,\u201d the prime minister told the chamber.</p> <p>The prime minister said the government has ensured \u201cno Adler-lever action guns with more than five rounds can be imported in any category\u201d.</p> <p>That ban would remain in place until state and territory ministers resolved a permanent view of the weapon, the prime minister said. Police ministers meet this Friday.</p> <p>The ABCC bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/oct/18/malcolm-turnbull-rejects-amnesty-claim-that-detention-akin-to-torture-politics-live\">finally passed the house</a> by close of business on Tuesday, but its fate in the Senate remains uncertain.</p> <p>Leyonjhelm, who had been expected to vote for the bill, is now not making any commitments, beyond talking to the government.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/oct/18/malcolm-turnbull-rejects-amnesty-claim-that-detention-akin-to-torture-politics-live\">Malcolm Turnbull says there is 'no chance' of Coalition watering down gun laws \u2013 politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The LDP senator told Sky News on Tuesday he had told Turnbull in August he was angry about being \u201cdudded\u201d over the sunset clause.</p> <p>He said subsequent to that meeting, the workplace minister, Michaelia Cash, had given him the impression to government might meet his demands on gun control.</p> <p>Asked by host Andrew Bolt whether he\u2019d been given the impression his demands would be met, Leyonjhelm replied: \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>He said there was no definitive deal, only an \u201cintention\u201d expressed by Cash that they wanted to find an agreeable landing point.</p>"
