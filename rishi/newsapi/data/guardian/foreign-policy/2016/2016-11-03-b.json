  "<p>Red Fawn Fallis saved her from the violence and chaos. On 22 October, when police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/25/north-dakota-oil-pipeline-protest-arrests-journalists-filmmakers\">arrested more than 120 people</a> protesting against the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, Lauren Howland was caught in the middle and suffered a broken wrist when, she said, an officer attacked her.</p> <p>Fallis, a 37-year-old Native American protester, known as a mother to many of the youth at the Standing Rock protest in North Dakota, \u201cpersonally came back into the frontlines and wheeled us all out\u201d, Howland, 21, recalled. \u201cShe\u2019s a protector.\u201d</p> <p>Howland and other youth protesters said they were were devastated to find out a week later that local police had arrested Fallis and charged her with attempted murder, saying that she had pulled out a .38 revolver and fired three gunshots at police during another mass arrest incident.</p> <p>The Morton County sheriff\u2019s office has held up the charges as an example of what it says is the violent and illegal behavior of Native American protesters as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/dakota-access-pipeline-protest-arrests-standing-rock\">standoffs continue to erupt</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/dakota-access-obama-suggests-ways-to-reroute-pipeline-being-investigated\">indigenous demonstrations</a> against the $3.7bn oil pipeline.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/north-dakota-access-oil-pipeline-protests-explainer\">The Dakota Access pipeline protests explained: who, what and why</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Fallis\u2019s close friends and supporters are questioning the circumstances of her arrest, telling the Guardian that the firearm accusations were inconceivable and comparing her to famous Native American political prisoners. To some pipeline protesters, who described Fallis as a passionate activist dedicated to peaceful tactics, her detention is the latest sign that North Dakota police are aggressively targeting a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/12/north-dakota-standing-rock-protests-civil-rights\">growing movement</a> and will go to great lengths to protect a powerful corporation threatening sacred tribal lands.</p> <p>\u201cNone of us could believe it. We just collectively burst into tears,\u201d said Eryn Wise, a 26-year-old protester and member of the Jicarilla Apache and Laguna Pueblo tribes. \u201cWe are all terrified.\u201d</p> <p>The charges, which could result in a 20-year prison sentence, mark the latest case to ignite fierce tensions between law enforcement officials and Native Americans as the construction of Energy Transfer Partners\u2019 pipeline gets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/north-dakota-access-pipeline-protest-last-stand\">closer to the Missouri river</a> and tribal camps fighting the project.</p> <p>Police officials, who claim that the protest actions have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/27/north-dakota-access-pipeline-protest-arrests-pepper-spray\">illegal and dangerous</a>, have made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/27/north-dakota-access-pipeline-protest-arrests-pepper-spray\">more than 400 arrests</a>, charging activists and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/17/amy-goodman-north-dakota-oil-access-pipeline-protest-arrest-riot\">journalists</a> for rioting, trespassing, resisting arrest, conspiracy and other serious felonies. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/dakota-access-pipeline-protest-investigation-human-rights-abuses\">Human rights groups</a> have sharply condemned local police for the response, which has involved pepper spray, teargas, riot gear, army tanks and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/dakota-access-pipeline-native-american-protesters\">questionable jail conditions</a>.</p> <p>On 27 October, when police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/28/dakota-access-pipeline-protesters-pepper-sprayed-by-police-video\">arrested 141 people</a> who had set up camps in the path of construction, officers attempted to arrest Fallis on the local highway, claiming she was \u201cbeing an instigator and acting disorderly\u201d.

Where is the proof?\u201d</p> <p>Asked for copies of any footage of the arrest or photos of the firearm, a spokeswoman for the sheriff said: \u201cThat is all evidence that will not be released until the investigation is complete.\u201d</p> <p>Fallis is a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe and had previously lived in North Dakota, but is currently based in Denver, Colorado. Stevens said that Fallis\u2019s mother, a longtime family friend, recently died and that Fallis was protesting against the pipeline in her honor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/free.html\" data-alt=\"membership ask\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/free.html\">membership ask</a> </figure>  <p>Stevens, who had to leave the protests to return to her Colorado home, said she plans to soon head back to Standing Rock to fight for Fallis\u2019s release: \u201cI\u2019m going to sit there as many nights as I need to until she gets out.\u201d</p> <p>Howland said that Fallis made a point of reminding youth activists to stay \u201cpeaceful and prayerful\u201d and never resort to violence.</p> <p>Wise, who helps watch over 18 young people who share the youth council camp, said Fallis had a four-wheeler vehicle and often helped rescue protesters who needed medical attention during police confrontations.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that they are targeting Red Fawn, because she\u2019s definitely an asset to our community,\u201d said Wise, who got emotional describing Fallis\u2019s role on camp. \u201cShe\u2019s the person who comes in to check on me to make sure I\u2019m doing self-care.\u201d</p> <p>On social media, many have supported Fallis with the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FreeRedFawn&amp;src=tyah\">#FreeRedFawn</a> and some have compared her to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/jul/10/weekend7.weekend1\">Leonard Peltier</a>, a native activist and former <a href=\"http://time.com/4458253/leonard-peltier-clemency/\">member of the American Indian Movement</a> who was <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/12/19/exclusive_leonard_peltier_speaks_out_from\">convicted</a> of aiding in the killing of two FBI agents in 1975. </p> <p>Many at the camp said it was very hard to believe Fallis could have even been carrying a gun given that native elders had made clear that no one should be armed at Standing Rock. </p> <p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t seem like she was rebellious or radical,\u201d said Arlana Curley, a Cheyenne River Sioux tribe member, adding about law enforcement. \u201cThey\u2019re trying their best to make us as Native Americans look like we are these bad people.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><em>No billionaire owner, no shareholders.
