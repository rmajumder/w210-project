Two fled on foot, police said, while officers approached King in an alley.</p> <p>A woman who placed the 911 call continued to speak with a dispatcher as police arrived, saying there were seven or eight suspects. \u201cOh! He\u2019s shooting them,\u201d she said. \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p> <p>Police said King removed a BB gun from his waistband, when Mason fired \u201cmultiple\u201d times and killed him. King was transported to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 8.22pm.</p> <p>The city\u2019s mayor and police chief said on Thursday a thorough investigation will be conducted into the shooting, and the results will be turned over to a grand jury.</p> <p>\u201cAny loss of life is tragic,\u201d Columbus\u2019s mayor, Andrew Ginther, told reporters, \u201cbut the loss of a young person is particularly difficult.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/15/police-shoot-boy-bb-gun-ohio-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/537hn\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2721839\"            data-video-name=\"Police who shot boy: 'he had a BB gun practically identical\u2019 to real weapon \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57db01b1e4b0e813b694d6c8\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/15/160915bbgun2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/15/160915bbgun2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/15/160915bbgun2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/15/police-shoot-boy-bb-gun-ohio-video\">Police who shot boy: \u2018he had a BB gun practically identical\u2019 to real weapon</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In an interview with the Columbus Dispatch, King\u2019s friend, Demetrius Braxton, said the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/09/15/13-year-old-shooting-update.html\">child wanted to rob someone for money</a>. Braxton, 19, said he was with King at the time of the shooting, and that the 13-year-old\u2019s BB gun looked like an authentic firearm.</p> <p>\u201cThe cops said to get down,\u201d Braxton, who could not be immediately reached for comment, told the newspaper. \u201cWe got down, but my friend got up and ran \u2026 [and] when he ran, the cop shot him.\u201d The Dispatch reported that police interviewed Braxton until about 1am on Thursday, and he was released pending further investigation.</p> <p>Police chief Kim Jacobs said on Thursday that her \u201cofficers carry a gun that looks practically identical to this weapon\u201d. The chief asked for patience in the city while the shooting was investigated.</p> <p> \u201cWe want the right answers, not quick answers,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/09/15/13-year-old-shooting-update.html\">she said</a>. Under the police division\u2019s policies and procedures for officer-involved shootings, Mason will be placed on administrative leave and receive psychological counseling.</p> <p>Attorneys representing King\u2019s family on Thursday claimed that \u201cnumerous\u201d witness accounts conflict with the police division\u2019s version of events.</p> <p>\u201cThe family is obviously distraught by the murder of Tyre,\u201d said attorney Chandra Brown, <a href=\"https://www.waltonbrownlaw.com/news/29\">in a statement</a>. \u201cOur preliminary research indicates that Tyre was a child who was loved and cherished by his family. The grief is worsened further by the fact that this death comes at the hands of a man who was sworn to protect the citizens of Columbus.\u201d</p> <p>A message was left for Brown seeking comment.</p> <p>Mason has previously been involved in several shootings while in the line of duty.</p> <p>In December 2012, he shot and killed John Kaufman following a dispute between Kaufman and another individual, according to the Dispatch. Kaufman refused police orders to drop his firearm before Mason fatally shot him. The officer was cleared in the incident. The Dispatch reported that Mason was also cleared of wrongdoing in separate shootings in 2010 and 2013.</p> <p>King\u2019s death shares similarities with the police shooting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tamir-rice\">12-year-old Tamir Rice</a> in 2014. Rice, who was black, was carrying a pellet gun when Cleveland police officer Timothy Loehmann <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/12/tamir-rice-police-killing-investigation-cleveland\">opened fire mere seconds after pulling up to a park</a>.</p> <p>Attorneys for King\u2019s family said the child enjoyed playing sports \u2013 football, hockey, soccer \u2013 and called for a thorough, \u201cunbiased\u201d investigation.</p> <p>\u201cThe family of Tyre King asks for support from their community as they seek answers in this tragic killing,\u201d said co-counsel Sean Walton. \u201cPlease do not rush to judgment.\u201d</p>"
