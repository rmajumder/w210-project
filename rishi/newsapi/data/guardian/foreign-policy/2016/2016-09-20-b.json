  "<p>In one of Michael Bell\u2019s earliest encounters with Tyre King, the sports coach had to sneak the boy into a Columbus, Ohio, recreation center to play basketball. The age limit for the play center was 12, and Tyre was 13.</p> <p>\u201cBut, me, I was like, \u2018Hey, I want to get these kids in here,\u2019\u201d said Bell, 43. \u201cThis is a safe haven. So, I\u2019d sneak him in sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>Tyre, barely 5ft tall, just shy of 100lbs at 13 years old, was a bubbly kid who typically wore a wide smile, \u201cjust trying to figure himself out\u201d, Bell said on Monday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c2a9856cec8ee1fd496009fd24ec73818132c28e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2a9856cec8ee1fd496009fd24ec73818132c28e/0_82_335_335/335.jpg\" alt=\"Tyre King\" width=\"335\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tyre King.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last Wednesday, Tyre was killed by a Columbus police officer who was responding to a report of armed robbery. Police said King used a BB gun that resembled a genuine firearm to rob a Columbus resident of $10. When officers arrived, Tyre was spotted with two males who soon fled on foot. Moments later, police said, an officer fired \u201cmultiple\u201d times after Tyre reached for a BB gun in his waistband. He was pronounced dead at a hospital soon after.</p> <p>His death has gripped the Rust Belt city of 850,000, where residents protesting the shooting say uneven economic development has not benefited poorer neighborhoods like the one where Tyre lived. </p> <p>The environment Tyre was raised in mirrors \u201cso many young men\u201d in Columbus, said Mark Stansberry, Tyre\u2019s former hockey coach. \u201cA lot of dysfunctionality,\u201d he said, \u201cbut he was resilient.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was \u2026 always coming in with that smile,\u201d Stansberry said. \u201cHis smile was as big as the helmet.\u201d </p> <p>Last Wednesday, around 7.45pm, Columbus police said officers were dispatched to respond to reports of an armed robbery of a man for $10. The victim said a suspect was carrying a Ruger pistol.<br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to mess with it over $10,\u201d the victim told the dispatcher. When police arrived, three males \u2013 including Tyre \u2013 matching the description of the suspects were spotted. Officers approached Tyre in an alley. Shortly after, police say Tyre reached for a BB gun from his waistband. It was then Mason, a nine-year veteran of the Columbus police division, shot King \u201cmultiple\u201d times. Tyre was transferred to a local hospital and pronounced dead at 8.22pm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/tyre-king-shooting-columbus-police-examiner\">Tyre King 'more likely than not' running from Columbus police when fatally shot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But reports and an independent autopsy released on Monday offered more clues of what transpired when police arrived. A friend with the teen at the time of the shooting, Demetrius Braxton, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/09/15/13-year-old-shooting-update.html\">told</a> the Columbus Dispatch that police ordered them to get down, \u201cbut my friend got up and ran \u2026 [and] when he ran, the cops shot him.\u201d</p> <p>The county coroner said on Monday that results of its autopsy on Tyre won\u2019t be released for at least six weeks, pending the completion of toxicology tests. Columbus mayor Andrew Ginther promised a thorough investigation into the shooting, and has said the results will be turned over to a grand jury.</p> <p>Conflicting reports from a witness and friend of Tyre, along with an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/tyre-king-shooting-columbus-police-examiner\">independent medical examiner\u2019s autopsy</a> released by the child\u2019s family on Monday, have stoked concerns from residents and activists about law enforcement in the city. </p> <p>\u201cThe Columbus police department, the City of Columbus and most importantly Tyre King and his family deserve the benefit of an investigation from a law enforcement agency that has no direct impact from the outcome of that investigation,\u201d the family said in a statement.</p> <h2>\u2018Safe for whom?\u2019</h2> <p>The area where Tyre was killed is a \u201chistoric black community\u201d that has witnessed a rise in investment over the last several years, said Tammy Fournier-Alsaada, an organizer with the People\u2019s Justice Project and lifelong resident of Columbus.</p> <p>\u201cYou see historic buildings; the beauty and architecture in any one of these houses around here will blow your mind,\u201d Fournier-Alsaada, 55, said during a drive around the neighborhood on Sunday. Fixtures by the local artist Ahmina Robinson, who passed away last year, are situated around the area, Fournier-Alsaada said, \u201cto remind people of the history of what this looked like when black folks\u201d lived there.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/columbus-police-shoot-dead-13-year-old-bb-gun-ohio-tyree-king\">Columbus police fatally shoot 13-year-old boy carrying BB gun</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But as the city has reinvested in the area, police have deployed what\u2019s known as the city\u2019s Summer Safety Initiative to patrol the streets, she said, where officers \u201cterrorize, arrest, harass\u201d people.</p> <p>\u201cThere are many cases [stemming from the initiative] where police have been investigated and some have been kicked off the force for their tactics,\u201d Fournier-Alsaada said. Indeed, in June, police officers in the initiative <a href=\"http://www.columbusalive.com/content/stories/2016/07/21/feature-columbus-community-groups-fight-for-racial-justice.html\">shot and killed 23-year-old Henry Green</a>, near the high school attended by Tyre.</p> <p>With both shootings occurring in a span of a few months, activists said they were stunned to hear Mayor Ginther proclaim Columbus is one of the safest major cities in the US.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of activists are asking: \u2018Well, safe for whom?\u2019\u201d said Amber Evans, 26, also an organizer with the People\u2019s Justice Project. \u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t feel safe for kids with toy guns, for little black boys.\u201d</p> <p>Tyre\u2019s death was the 13th police shooting in Columbus this year, the city\u2019s police chief said last week, and that includes five fatalities. The city ranks <a href=\"http://www.timesunion.com/news/crime/article/Debate-over-whether-Columbus-is-really-the-9231180.php\">27th in major cities for violent crime</a>, according to FBI data, and 21st for homicides. Still, Evans said, the semblance of safety and access to opportunity isn\u2019t shared across the city\u2019s residents.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s this idea that Columbus is this place where we have low crime and we have affordable housing and job opportunities, but all of those things are only afforded to the few, and that few does include people of color,\u201d she said.</p> <p>At the rally on Monday, Evans and Fournier-Alsaada\u2019s group released a list of demands to the city\u2019s mayor, including a call to let residents shape the Summer Safety Initiative, new trauma service programs in areas affected by violence, and new community-policing initiatives.</p> <p>Standing nearby, Larry Robertson, a local musician, reflected on how his former hometown of Cleveland was rankled by the death of Tamir Rice, who was killed by police while carrying a pellet gun in a city park at 12 years old.</p> <p>\u201cBeing from Cleveland with Tamir, that really upset me,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThen with it happening again here within a couple years. I wasn\u2019t even over that, per se.\u201d</p> <p>The fact Tyre died at 13 years old, Robertson said, shook him.</p> <p>\u201cIf I was to die today, I\u2019ve had a chance to live life,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve made memories, I\u2019ve been in love, I\u2019ve known what it feels like to have small successes. Traveled a little bit. Thirteen, I didn\u2019t know shit. I didn\u2019t experience anything, I didn\u2019t get out of my neighborhood which was in the inner city. I hadn\u2019t had a chance to make my mistakes and learn from them.\u201d</p> <p>Brian Thompson, 37, traveled to the rally from his hometown of Akron, Ohio. A father of twin boys who are 10, the death of Tyre has been unnerving and \u201cscary\u201d, Thompson said. Last week, he was in a sporting goods store when one of his children asked if he could buy a paintball gun. The answer was simple. </p> <p>\u201cI told him no, you can\u2019t have any guns,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t afford for you to have a gun. Our kids can\u2019t play with toy guns.\u201d </p>"
