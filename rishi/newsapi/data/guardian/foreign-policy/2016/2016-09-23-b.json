  "<p>The police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was charged with first-degree manslaughter and released early on Friday morning after posting a $50,000 bond.</p> <p>Officer Betty Shelby was booked at 1.11am and was held in custody for 20 minutes before posting bail. Shelby was charged in relation to last week\u2019s killing of Terence Crutcher, who was unarmed.

Demonstrations in Tulsa since Crutcher\u2019s death have been consistently peaceful.</p> <p>\u201cThe tragic circumstances surrounding the death of Mr Crutcher are on the hearts and minds of many people in this community,\u201d said the district attorney, Steve Kunzweiler, during brief remarks before he announced the charges.</p> <p>The Oklahoma state medical examiner\u2019s office said 40-year-old Crutcher died from \u201ca penetrating gunshot wound of chest\u201d and his death was being considered a homicide. </p> <p>But spokeswoman Amy Elliott said a full autopsy report and toxicology results for Crutcher were not yet complete.</p> <p>According to court documents filed by prosecutors, Shelby \u201cunlawfully and unnecessarily\u201d shot the father of four children because he was refusing to comply with her order. An affidavit from Doug Campbell, Kunzweiler\u2019s chief investigator, said Shelby \u201creacted unreasonably by escalating the situation\u201d, adding that she was \u201cemotionally involved to the point that she overreacted\u201d.</p> <p>Shelby came across Crutcher, who was standing next to his vehicle, which had apparently stalled, when she was on her way to a domestic violence call on 16 September. </p> <p>Shelby\u2019s lawyer, Scott Wood, said the officer had completed drug-recognition expert training and felt Crutcher was under the influence of PCP. \u201cShe felt like he had exhibited enough clues that he could have a gun in his pocket.\u201d Police Sgt Dave Walker has said investigators found a vial of PCP in Crutcher\u2019s vehicle. Attorneys for Crutcher\u2019s family have said even if there were drugs in the SUV, it would not justify the shooting.</p> <p>The affidavit filed on Thursday said Crutcher was walking away from officers toward his vehicle, with his hands up, and not following commands. It also states Shelby had \u201ccleared the driver\u2019s side front\u201d of Crutcher\u2019s vehicle before she began interacting with Crutcher, suggesting she may have known there was no gun on the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/terence-crutcher-keith-scott-police-video-bodycams-evidence\">Terence Crutcher and Keith Scott shootings demonstrate value of video evidence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Attorney Damario Solomon-Simmons said: \u201cWe are happy that charges were brought, but let me be clear: the family wants and deserves full justice.</p> <p>\u201cNot only for this family, not only for Terence but to be a deterrent for law officers all around this nation to know that you cannot kill unarmed citizens.\u201d<br></p> <p>Tulsa\u2019s mayor, Dewey Bartlett, praised the police department for quickly providing evidence to the district attorney\u2019s office.</p> <p>\u201cThese are important steps to ensure that justice and accountability prevail,\u201d Bartlett said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to be transparent.\u201d</p> <p>Police released dashcam and helicopter footage of the incident shortly afterward that shows Crutcher surrounded by officers before being shot.
