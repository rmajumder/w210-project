  "<p>\u201cI just say whatever dumb stuff comes into my head, and most of it is disgusting and horrible,\u201d Amy Schumer muses happily, midway through her set. This, of course, is a lie: while Schumer still likes to project an image of herself as a pottymouth who\u2019s just winging it, you don\u2019t become one of the biggest standups in the world by the age of 35 without working your butt off.</p> <p>Schumer keeps her 90-minute show under deceptively tight control, sneaking frequent peeks at her notes while affecting to stroll casually through her mental landscape, which spans all of Americana from the Kardashians to an improbably hilarious section on gun control \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 in the US.<br></p> <p>\u201cSomeone on the suspected terrorist list can buy a gun. So we\u2019re like, \u2018Get the hell out of our country! But before you do, would you like to buy a gun?\u2019\u201d she says, touching on a subject that has become a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/26/amy-schumer-renews-call-stricter-gun-control\">cause for Schumer</a> ever since a gunman attacked an audience at a screening of her film, Trainwreck, last summer, killing two young women.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/27/amy-schumer-not-trying-be-likable\">Amy Schumer: \u2018I'm not trying to be likable\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is Schumer\u2019s first international tour since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/trainwreck\">Trainwreck</a>, which pushed her out of the category of \u201csuccessful comedian\u201d and into the \u201cbona fide A-list celebrity\u201d golden circle. This shift has not always seemed comfortable for her: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/27/amy-schumer-not-trying-be-likable\">in interviews</a> she has become increasingly suspicious and monosyllabic and in her forthcoming book, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.vogue.com/13467201/amy-schumer-the-girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo-review/\">The Girl With the Lower Back Tattoo</a>, she appears unsure how to reconcile her celebrity status with her everygirl image. </p> <p>But on stage, which she has always said is where she feels happiest, there are no such troubles. Amid her usual favourite subjects \u2013 sex, women\u2019s neuroses and neuroses about women \u2013 she achieves what few have done before her and makes her tales of newfound fame genuinely funny and interesting. Her riff on what it feels like when near-naked photos of you go viral and you don\u2019t have a celebrity-sized body is done with a light touch, while still making a sharp jab; and her anecdote about her encounter with the American broadcaster Katie Couric made me double over with laughter. While many of the stories she tells are straight out of her book, she is more sure-footed with them on stage and has a better control of the tone.</p> <p>Yet it is hard not to wish Schumer would relax some of her control. Some anecdotes, while amusing, don\u2019t really go anywhere, seemingly said by rote just because they are on her setlist. By contrast, she sparks to life when dealing with a heckler, shooting back whipsmart retorts without pausing for breath. She should trust herself more and not stick quite so rigidly to the plan.</p> <p>It will be interesting to see how long Schumer can pull off this trick: affecting normality while hanging out with Hillary Clinton and earning $8m book advances. Going by those who have tried before her, the safe bet is not that long. She is already outgrowing her persona as the chaotic mess who happily blacks out on sleeping pills and wine, to the disgust of her boyfriend \u2013 and she knows it. That shtick is too small for her huge celebrity presence. But for now, at least on stage, she is still acing it. </p> <ul> <li>At the O2 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.amyschumer.com/tour\">Apollo Manchester</a> on 3 September.
