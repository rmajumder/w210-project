  "<p>It was a typical scene at the start of the new school year \u2013 student groups setting out tables and trying to sign up recruits for sororities, clubs and religious organisations. Until the end of the row, that is, where hundreds of people had gathered to pick up free dildos.</p> <p>Wednesday\u2019s Cocks Not Glocks protest against Texas\u2019s \u201ccampus carry\u201d law was held on the first day of classes at the University of Texas at Austin, which has spearheaded resistance to the new rule from students and faculty members at colleges in the state.</p> <p>The rally took place along a tree-lined avenue beneath the tower at the heart of the campus from where Charles Whitman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/campus-carry-texas-law-ut-tower-massacre-anniversary\">embarked on a shooting spree</a> on 1 August 1966.</p> <p>The new law, passed last year by Texas\u2019s Republican-dominated legislature, came into effect on the 50th anniversary of the massacre. It permits licensed gun owners aged 21 and older to carry concealed handguns in most places on public university campuses, including dorms and classrooms.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have crazy laws but this is by far the craziest, that you can\u2019t bring a dildo to campus but you can bring your gun</p> <footer> <cite>Rosie Zander, history student</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Demonstrators gathered to brandish sex toys in the air or strap them to their backpacks. Or other places. \u201cWe have crazy laws here but this is by far the craziest, that you can\u2019t bring a dildo on to campus legally but you can bring your gun. We\u2019re just trying to fight absurdity with absurdity,\u201d said Rosie Zander, a 20-year-old history student. </p> <p>\u201cWe wanted something fun that people could really engage in. Because it\u2019s hard to get involved in the political process at our age, people our age don\u2019t tend to vote or get involved, and this is so easy. Strap a dildo on and you\u2019re showing the Texas legislature this is not a decision we wanted.\u201d<br></p> <p>Standing near a pile of empty boxes and a decorative small forest of upright phalluses, Zander said that Cocks Not Glocks has distributed more than 5,000 dildos in the past five days, donated by sex shops. A few metres away, someone waved a poster that declared \u201cCock and Load\u201d near a sign fixed to a lamppost advising passers-by that this is a tobacco-free campus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bff009acf8acbbc36d45e752c00a8d05c0cb57c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bff009acf8acbbc36d45e752c00a8d05c0cb57c4/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators with sex toys\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators with sex toys.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Marshall Tidrick</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Campus (Dildo) Carry movement <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/local/education/campus-chronicles/article/campus-carry-ut-austin-dildo-Q-A-texas-6564913.php\">began</a> last year when Jessica Jin, a University of Texas alum, organised a protest aiming to satirise the apparent absurdity of weapons being allowed on campus but not the showing of sex toys, which arguably contravenes university rules and a state law against displays of obscene items.</p> <p>The choice of device also aims to challenge perceptions that carrying a gun is normal. Jin told the crowd on Wednesday that she felt self-conscious shopping at Home Depot this week with a dildo strapped to her backpack, but protesters should \u201cdeal with the discomfort, deal with the weird looks \u2013 that\u2019s the way we should be treating gun culture\u201d.</p> <p>Proponents of campus carry argue that the law will apply to only a small number of responsible gun owners who want to exercise their constitutional rights and enhance their personal safety and that other states have had similar laws for years without major problems.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Cocks not glocks video\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FGuardianUs%2Fvideos%2F553744611479973%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=400&amp;height=400\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" style=\"max-width:400px;max-height:400px\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Critics claim the measure is opposed by the vast majority of students and staff, as well as police; will have a chilling effect on free speech; is more likely to reduce safety than promote it, especially given that many students are young people under stress; may cause \u201cbrain drain\u201d among faculty and discourage students to apply; and was introduced not because of public demand but so politicians can appease powerful pro-gun groups such as the National Rifle Association. Attempts to pass further permissive gun laws are likely when the Texas legislature reconvenes next year.</p> <p>Miguel Robles, a 19-year-old political communications student, wielded a poster that said: \u201cYou\u2019re packin\u2019 heat, I\u2019m packin\u2019 meat.\u201d He said that he feels \u201cless safe now that campus carry exists. During class you\u2019re not sure if you can argue or have discussions any more because if someone gets very offended at any moment, [violence] could just spill out \u2026 It\u2019s just very unnerving, really,\u201d he added. \u201cI haven\u2019t met anyone that thinks it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p> <p>Someone who does is Jason Buckelew, a 36-year-old who was one of several gun rights advocates mingling with the protesters. He wore a black T-shirt with the slogan \u201cWelcome to Texas. Notice: this is not a gun-free zone.\u201d The bulges in the pockets on the right side of his camo shorts were made by a Glock and a Ruger LCP pocket pistol.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37fb413997d23c431528247b0ea344fd7c75b534\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37fb413997d23c431528247b0ea344fd7c75b534/0_296_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cocks Not Glocks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cocks Not Glocks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Marshall Tidrick</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cShooting sprees happen in gun-free zones. It\u2019s just crazy not to arm yourself. You should be able to defend yourself wherever you go,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say that having guns on campus will stifle their free speech but then they\u2019re walking around with sex toys, so they\u2019re not very stifled, really.\u201d</p> <p>Buckelew would have been committing a crime if he had displayed his weapons openly on the campus, but under a state law introduced in January, he can carry handguns visibly in most other public places in Texas \u2013 and does. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s cool that I do it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On Monday a federal judge in Austin <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2016/08/22/judge-denies-professors-attempt-block-campus-carry/\">denied</a> a request by three professors for a preliminary injunction blocking the law. They argue that it infringes free speech by creating an intimidating atmosphere that will stifle the unhindered discussion of controversial issues that is an important part of academic life.</p> <p>\u201cI do believe in the second amendment and the right to own guns and bear arms, however I don\u2019t think that public university is really the place for that,\u201d said Zenyth Gale, a 22-year-old burlesque dancer and doughnut shop worker with a substantial green phallus attached to the front of her skirt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a1b5c69cf26743b7d1b8222ee1dbd988a155702\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a1b5c69cf26743b7d1b8222ee1dbd988a155702/0_109_5945_3568/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Students at the protest in Austin, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Students at the protest in Austin, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zuma/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEvery mass shooting they say, \u2018Oh, if everyone has their own guns, someone will be able to stop it.\u2019 But that just isn\u2019t how it\u2019s turned out. It\u2019s devastating. I mean, after Sandy Hook there\u2019s been no gun reform or anything and I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to take after that.\u201d</p> <p>Jennifer McKay, a senior majoring in history, said she is \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d about the new law. \u201cI think that having guns in classrooms is absurd and this protest is equally absurd and we may as well be sex-positive while making a political statement,\u201d she said.</p>"
