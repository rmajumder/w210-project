  "<h2><strong>Donald Trump\u2019s claims </strong></h2> <p><strong>\u201cWe will have a second amendment that is a very small replica of what it is now\u201d in a Clinton administration</strong></p> <p>Trump is being reductive: Clinton has never called for abolishing the second amendment, the right to bear arms, though she does support gun control measures such as an assault weapons ban, increased background checks and greater liability for manufacturers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-presidential-debate-election-result\">Donald Trump refuses to say if he will accept election result in final debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As moderator Chris Wallace noted, Clinton has said she disagrees with the supreme court\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/27/washington/27scotus.html\">5-4 decision</a> in 2008 to broadly affirm the personal right to gun ownership. Her campaign has said Clinton would prefer states have the right to enact as strict gun control laws as they see fit.</p> <p><strong>\u201cChicago has the toughest gun laws and the most gun deaths\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></strong></p> <p>Chicago police have pushed back on the notion that the city\u2019s gun laws have proven ineffective, noting that a huge number of gun seizures were of <a href=\"https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20140528/chicago/majority-of-illegally-owned-guns-first-bought-out-of-state-cops-mayor\">firearms purchased outside the city or outside Illinois</a>, where laws are more lax. Trump is largely correct about Chicago\u2019s homicide problem: the city is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/09/01/chicago-has-seen-more-homicides-this-year-than-new-york-and-los-angeles-combined/\">on pace </a>to have more than 600 gun deaths in 2016.</p> <p><strong>\u201cIf you go with what Hillary is saying in the ninth month you can rip the baby out of the womb of the mother \u2026 up to the last day.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Clinton does not support such an extreme view on abortion, nor have courts ever ruled such a late term operation legal, or suggested that they would. States vary on how late they allow abortions \u2013 in some states there have been attempts to introduce very short time limits, including in North Dakota where a proposal in 2013 for a ban six weeks after a woman\u2019s last menstrual period was ruled unconstitutional, but in most states the time limit is at the start of the third trimester or earlier. There are nine states without specific term prohibitions, but clinics do not abort at such late terms: only 1.2% of abortions occur after 21 weeks, according to the nonprofit Guttmacher Institute.</p> <p><strong>\u201cClinton wants open borders\u201d</strong></p> <p>Clinton does not want \u201copen borders\u201d: she supports reform to let people pass background checks and pay back taxes in order to stay in the US, and she supports Obama\u2019s executive actions to shield some migrants, such as people who were brought to the US as children. Like Obama, she supports deportation for people with criminal records.</p> <p><strong>\u201cObama has moved millions of people out\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump is correct: Barack Obama has deported more than 2.5 million people, more than any other recent president, but he has prioritized migrants with criminal records. \u201cMillions and millions\u201d, however, is an exaggeration, and Obama also supports shielding millions of undocumented immigrants without criminal records, and reform for citizenship.</p> <p><strong>Obama \u201chas thousands and thousands of people, they have no idea where they come from\u201d<br></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/defy.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/defy.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>Ten thousand Syrian refugees have come to the United States in 2016, but Trump makes it sound misleadingly large.</p> <p>He is patently wrong about the screening process. The US has among the most intensive screening process in the world for refugees: it requires they register and interview with the United Nations, which then must refer them to the US, refugees who pass this test then interview with state department contractors and have at least two background checks, then they have three fingerprint and photo screenings, then US immigration reviews the case, then Homeland Security interviews the refugee, then a doctor examines the refugee, and finally several security agencies perform one last check after the refugee has been matched with a resettlement agency.</p> <p>The process <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">takes 18 months</a> to two years. The US has a very clear idea about which refugees it allows into the country.</p> <p><strong>\u201cI don\u2019t know Putin. He said nice things about me \u2026 He has no respect for our president.\u201d</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s not clear whether Trump has ever spoken with the Russian president. Putin was invited to but did not attend a 2013 beauty pageant in Moscow, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-trumps-financial-ties-to-russia-and-his-unusual-flattery-of-vladimir-putin/2016/06/17/dbdcaac8-31a6-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html\">one of the oligarchs</a> who helped organize the event. \u201cWill he become my new best friend?\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/347191326112112640\">wondered</a> beforehand.</p> <p>The pair may have communicated through intermediaries.

Trump likely heard the word translated as \u201cbright\u201d or \u201cbrilliant\u201d, though its connotations are often more pejorative than not: bright in the sense of glaring and gaudy, brilliant in the sense of dazzling light. Putin also called him \u201ctalented, undoubtedly\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not our business to decide his merits; that\u2019s for US voters,\u201d Putin said earlier this year.

Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on this claim, despite personal briefings with US intelligence officials.</p> <p>Even his running mate, Mike Pence, has accepted the briefings, and told NBC on Sunday: \u201cI think there\u2019s more and more evidence that implicates Russia.\u201d Earlier Wednesday a Russian man suspected of involvement in the hacks was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/world/europe/prague-russian-hacker.html?smid=tw-nytimesworld&amp;smtyp=cur\">arrested in Prague</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6750af5944b94e21e91b685fce4cf903544657e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6750af5944b94e21e91b685fce4cf903544657e0/0_236_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Republican nominee Donald Trump speaks during the final presidential debate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Republican nominee Donald Trump speaks during the final presidential debate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>\u201cThe border patrol agents, 16,500 plus, ICE, endorsed me. First time they\u2019ve ever endorsed a candidate\u201d</strong></p> <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a government agency. It does not endorse political candidates. A union representing about 7,600 ICE officials <a href=\"http://iceunion.org/about\">endorsed Trump</a> in September. A group <a href=\"http://www.bpunion.org/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/1824-national-border-patrol-council-endorses-donald-trump-for-president\">representing 16,500 of 21,000 </a>border patrol agents similarly endorsed Trump; this does not represent all the agents.</p> <p><strong>Clinton called for \u201copen borders\u201d</strong></p> <p>Clinton is correct that Trump took the quote out of context: she was talking primarily about trade to Banco Itau, a Brazilian bank that eventually became Unibanco. Here\u2019s what she said, according to a hacked email released by Wikileaks:</p> <blockquote> <p>My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.</p> </blockquote> <p>Clinton has flip-flopped on free trade since 2013, most notably supporting and then rejecting the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p> <p><strong>\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of Nato but they have to pay up\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump is not necessarily a big fan of Nato, which he has called \u201cobsolete\u201d, and he\u2019s wrong that allies do not pay for US military bases, though they do not pay perhaps as much as some Nato commanders want.</p> <p>The US has<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/11/world/europe/11gates.html\"> urged its Nato allies to pay more for years</a>, especially as eastern and central European allies have loudly warned about aggressive Russian action. The US <a href=\"http://www.act.nato.int/nsip\">currently pays</a> about 22% of overall Nato spending, compared to Germany\u2019s 15%, France\u2019s 11%, the UK\u2019s 10%, etc, and most Nato members <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_01/20160129_160128-pr-2016-11-eng.pdf\">fail to pay the 2% of GDP</a> into defense as the alliance\u2019s guidelines dictate. But the US does receive payments for military bases abroad <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/q-a-how-much-do-u-s-military-bases-in-japan-and-korea-cost-1461822624\">from countries like Japan and South Korea</a>, and takes profits from arms deals (sometimes to controversial clients, <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2016/04/u-s-foreign-military-support/\">such as Saudi Arabia</a>).</p> <p>The US also benefits strategically through foreign military bases, which have acted as foundations for American influence abroad.</p> <p><strong>\u201cI never said Japan should have nuclear weapons\u201d</strong><br></p> <p>Trump has suggested Japan and South Korea should develop their own nuclear weapons. He told<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/us/politics/donald-trump-transcript.html?_r=0\"> the New York Times in March</a>: \u201cWell I think maybe it\u2019s not so bad to have Japan \u2013 if Japan had that nuclear threat, I\u2019m not sure that would be a bad thing for us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/davidmunk/status/788917375814873090\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump says you won&#39;t find a quote from me suggesting Japan gets nuclear weapons..... err....  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/debate?src=hash\">#debate</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/TMtvOeJiwq\">pic.twitter.com/TMtvOeJiwq</a></p>&mdash; david munk (@davidmunk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidmunk/status/788917375814873090\">October 20, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><br><strong>\u201cObama has doubled the debt\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump has the raw numbers just about right. When Obama took office on 20 January 2009, <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/search?startMonth=01&amp;startDay=20&amp;startYear=2009&amp;endMonth=&amp;endDay=&amp;endYear=\">the federal debt was $10.63tn</a>. As of 28 September 2016,<a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current\"> it was $19.5tn</a>. Trump omits, however, two key points: Congress controls the government\u2019s wallet (ie Obama cannot spend or tax without approval from lawmakers), and Obama took office during the financial crisis, when Republicans, Democrats and most economists agreed that the US needed to spend in order to counteract the collapsing economy. Pence has the right numbers but imputes too much responsibility on the president.</p> <p><strong>\u201cWhen you ran the state department, $6bn was missing! Maybe it was stolen \u2026 nobody knows\u201d</strong></p> <p>This is not correct. Trump is alluding to a March 2014 alert, about contractor spending in the Middle East and Africa, by the state department\u2019s inspector general, who was so perturbed by careless language around the $6bn figure that he wrote the Washington Post a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/about-the-state-depts-missing-6-billion/2014/04/13/a6130790-c194-11e3-9ee7-02c1e10a03f0_story.html?utm_term=.452a9d665b36\">letter</a> that April. His alert did not conclude that the money was \u201cmissing\u201d he told the Post, but rather that officials had failed \u201cto adequately maintain contract files\u201d that created \u201csignificant financial risk\u201d. Files were missing or incomplete regarding several dozen contracts, not the money itself, and the state department agreed to his recommendations.</p> <p><strong>\u201cClinton flip-flopped on the Trans-Pacific Partnership\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump is right: Clinton has not been consistent on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and her language from 2010 through 2014 suggests she was broadly in support of Barack Obama\u2019s trade deal, before eventually opposing it as a presidential candidate. As secretary of state in 2012, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trade-tpp-20160926-snap-story.html\">she said</a>: \u201cThis TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world\u2019s total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment.\u201d</p> <p>She continued to <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2012/11/200664.htm\">praise it</a> while she worked for the Obama administration, variously calling it \u201chigh quality\u201d, \u201ccutting edge\u201d, \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d and \u201chigh standard\u201d.</p> <p><strong>\u201cShe gave us Isis \u2026 she created a vacuum\u201d</strong></p> <p>The claim that Hillary Clinton \u201cgave\u201d the world Isis condenses and distorts a conservative view that, closer to its original form, says that that by withdrawing American forces from Iraq, Barack Obama created a power vacuum in which Isis could rise.</p> <p>This argument ignores that Isis\u2019s first <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/19/world/middleeast/in-rise-of-isis-no-single-missed-key-but-many-strands-of-blame.html\">segments</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/world/middleeast/us-actions-in-iraq-fueled-rise-of-a-rebel.html\">formed</a> out of Iraq\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/11/-sp-isis-the-inside-story\">civil war</a>, while George W Bush was president, that the group gained strength in Syria\u2019s civil war, where the US did not intervene until 2014, that Obama withdrew American forces in 2011 under the <a href=\"http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081214-2.html\">timeline</a> agreed on by Bush and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/world/middleeast/united-states-and-iraq-had-not-expected-troops-would-have-to-leave.html\">Baghdad</a>, and that both Bush and Obama failed to come to an agreement with Baghdad over troops \u2013 in large part over a disagreement about whether American troops could be prosecuted by Iraq.</p> <p>Trump supported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-fact-check-foreign-policy-taxes-business\">the invasion of Iraq</a> in 2003 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-fact-check-foreign-policy-taxes-business\">\u201csurgical\u201d intervention</a> to remove Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, though he now claims otherwise.

He has in the past referred to both Cartwright and General David Petraeus in his argument that Clinton benefits from some kind of double standard.</p> <p>In 2015 Petraeus, a former CIA director and a four-star general, pled guilty to giving a large amount of classified information \u2013 including the identities of covert officers and war strategy \u2013 to his biographer, with whom he was having an affair. During the FBI investigation, Petraeus lied to agents, according to the plea deal. But the justice department only sentenced Petraeus to two years\u2019 probation and a $100,000 fine, provoking accusations that this relatively lenient sentence was evidence of a double standard for the powerful. The justice department\u2019s lenience toward Petraeus actually made it more difficult, in part, for prosecutors to recommend charges against Clinton.<br><br>This week Cartwright pled guilty to lying to the FBI in an investigation into leaking classified information about operations against Iran to journalists.

Trump has in the past tried to justify this claim by saying the US spends more on undocumented people than on veterans, but has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/lyin-trump-fact-check-mexico-wall-immigration\"> drawn a $113bn price tag from an explicitly anti-immigration foundation</a>.

The Veterans Affairs administration has a 2016 budget of $69.7bn.
