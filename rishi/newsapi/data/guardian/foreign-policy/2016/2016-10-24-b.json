  "<blockquote> <p>Dear Minister Keenan,<br>  Australia\u2019s gun control laws are the envy of the world. Since the landmark 1996 national firearms agreement (NFA) our state, territory and federal firearms laws have been focused on the goal of ensuring community safety. We believe that any review of the NFA must have direct input from gun control advocates and be focused on community safety.  The NFA only came about because of the courage of political leaders, especially former prime minister John Howard, in response to the tragedy of the mass shooting at Port Arthur in 1996. In the 20 years since Port Arthur, and the NFA that followed, Australia has not suffered another mass shooting. This is a clear case of good politics and genuine political leadership working to save lives. </p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/25/michael-keenan-criticised-for-holding-one-sided-meetings-with-gun-lobby\">Michael Keenan criticised for holding 'one-sided' meetings with gun lobby</a> </p> </aside>  <blockquote> <p>At present the Australian government is undertaking a review of the NFA. We support an unbiased review of the NFA that addresses any loopholes and weaknesses in the country\u2019s gun control laws. One weakness is the error in classifying the six shot Adler A110 shotgun as a category A rather than category C firearm. Related to this is the failure to make the temporary importation ban on the eight-shot Adler A110 permanent. However there are many other pressures on our gun control laws that deserve national attention.<br>  So it is with real concern that we see you have organised repeat official meetings to discuss changes to the NFA with the firearms industry and the pro-gun lobby in the form of the Firearms Industry Reference Group. At these meetings you have informed the gun lobby representatives that the review of the NFA is:  \u201c... an opportunity to simplify the national firearms agreement to assist the firearms community,\u201d and </p> <p>\u201c... the government is keen to simplify the regulations and the bureaucracy to lessen red tape for firearms users.\u201d<br>  The Firearms Industry Reference Group contains representatives from government departments and the Sporting Shooters\u2019 Association, the National Firearms Dealers Association, Shooting Australia and the Shooting Industry Foundation of Australia. It contains not a single gun control or community safety advocate. Unsurprisingly, these meetings ignore community safety issues and instead focus on watering down the NFA, importing more guns, increasing children\u2019s access to weapons and removing limits on firearms ownership.  If the review of the NFA is to retain credibility you must give at least equal access to gun control advocates. Gun violence can affect people in their relationships, their workplaces, their homes or the public domain. So it is essential you officially engage with representatives from the public health sector, criminologists, gun control advocates, unions, domestic violence workers and victim support groups. Given the enormous support in the community for our world-class gun control laws it is remarkable that these representatives are not already routinely engaged by your office in the review of the NFA.</p> <p>We look forward to hearing from you,<br></p> <p>Signed,<br></p> <p>1.

  "<p>Craig Baxam was lost. He thought he was in a town in northern Kenya called Marareme, though really he didn\u2019t have a clue. He then got on a bus headed to Garissa, towards the Somali border, but was puzzled by the way the other passengers referred to it as \u201cArara\u201d.<br></p> <p>Baxam was far from home, spoke no local language and knew little about the region he was traveling through. If he were successful in reaching southern Somalia, his destination, things would almost certainly get worse for him: the war-torn country, where he planned to live according to his faith, remains one of the most inhospitable and perilous on Earth. </p> <p>Yet none of that flustered him. All he wanted was to keep on moving towards the border. Find it, cross it and begin a new, better, devout life.</p> <p>Baxam, 24 at the time, had thrown to the winds his comfortable existence in Laurel, Maryland, where he worked for a TV services company. In December 2011 he cashed in his thrift savings plan account (all $3,613.38 of it), gave $1,000 of that to an acquaintance in need, and with the rest bought himself a ticket to Nairobi. He had decided to set out on a hijrah, a migration to a true Islamic land, as he was instructed to do in the Qu\u2019ran.</p> <p>To say that this was all new to Baxam would be an understatement. A black American raised Catholic who had recently discharged himself from the US army after four years of service, he grew up with no connection to the Muslim faith. But five months before his trip, he went through a dramatic and sudden conversion after stumbling on a religious website. </p> <p>Barely half a year later, he was making his way north through Kenya into the vast unknown.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/18/somalia-terrorist-carpenter-al-shabaab\">Somalia: one man\u2019s terrorist is another man\u2019s carpenter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As he travelled, Baxam kept his head down, stopping merely to eat and pray at mosques. He had good reason to be careful: he was heading towards one of the world\u2019s most anarchic conflict zones in a country that had been in the throes of an extreme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/04/somalia-al-shabaab-insurgency-mogadishu-mohamed-nur\">Islamist insurgency</a> for several years. </p> <p>Once inside Somalia, he planned to live under al-Shabaab \u2013 a group designated by Washington as a terrorist organisation which practices a very strict form of Islam under the religious law of sharia. </p> <p>The stakes were high. US and Kenyan authorities worked closely together to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/15/foreign-troops-in-somalia-struggle-to-keep-al-shabaab-at-bay\">intercept</a> any movement across the border from al-Shabaab members, and Baxam had a taste of those security efforts as he sat on the bus going north. He later told the FBI there were posters all along the route telling people to contact police should they see anyone acting strangely. He must have looked suspicious himself, he said, given what was about to happen.<br></p> <p>Soon after the bus pulled out, a man boarded and gently began asking Baxam questions. Where was he going? Did he speak the local dialect? Was there family nearby? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2a53d4e9e91c84f261770d6e2f099caf0526a578\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a53d4e9e91c84f261770d6e2f099caf0526a578/0_0_2021_2441/828.jpg\" alt=\"Craig Baxam with his mother Deanna in November 2015.\" width=\"828\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Craig Baxam with his mother Deanna in November 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Deanna Baxam</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Baxam thought to himself: I\u2019m in luck, here\u2019s someone who wants to help me. It didn\u2019t quite turn out like that. Not long after, the bus was surrounded by Kenyan police who swarmed onboard and took him away on suspicion of terrorism. </p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>At 7am on a Monday, 11 days after Craig Baxam was hauled off the bus, the phone rang at Deanna Baxam\u2019s house in Atlanta, more than 8,000 miles away. It was the Baltimore field office of the FBI. Her son, she was told, had been detained in Kenya and was in a Nairobi jail. </p> <p>That was all they said. Nothing about how long he\u2019d been held, where he\u2019d been, or what treatment he had endured.</p> <p>The following day, 4 January 2012, two FBI agents from the Atlanta division came knocking on Deanna Baxam\u2019s door. They asked whether she was willing to pay for her son\u2019s plane ticket home. When she inquired whether he had been charged with any crime, they said no, so she readily agreed, thinking Craig would soon be back with her.</p> <p>\u201cThey said: \u2018We would like to bring him home to you, but you have to pay the airfare.\u2019 So I gave them my charge card and they put a $3,000 ticket on it,\u201d Baxam said in the course of a three-hour interview with the Guardian in her home in the Atlanta suburbs.</p> <p>On 6 January 2012, she began the long drive to Maryland to meet her son as he flew into Baltimore Washington international airport. She was apprehensive, but happy he was safe and coming home. But somewhere on the interstate, another call came in from the FBI. Craig\u2019s plane had already landed, they told her. He had been re-arrested as he set foot on US soil and taken off to a federal institution. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/power.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/power.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>He was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3148000-Indictment-1.html\">charged</a> with attempting to provide material support to al-Shabaab, the designated terrorist organisation, and informed that he faced a maximum prison sentence of 15 years. </p> <p>Of all the many things that have happened to Deanna Baxam since that day, having the FBI asking her to pay for her son\u2019s plane ticket so he could be flown into the waiting claws of the US justice system perhaps hurts the most.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very angry about that. They used me as an American citizen, had me spend private funds to conduct law enforcement activities on behalf of the FBI. That\u2019s not the worst of it. The worst of it is this: my government screwed my son and made me pay for it.\u201d</p> <p>She may not have realized it fully at that time, but Deanna Baxam had just been sucked into one of the defining conflicts of the modern age: religious fundamentalism versus the US national security apparatus. </p> <p>On the one hand, she now had a son who professed to be a devout Muslim and who felt such a fierce commitment to his newly discovered faith that he was prepared to leave his family and radically change his life to practice it. On the other hand, she also had to deal with seemingly duplicitous anti-terrorist agents within the FBI who were bearing down on her child with the full might of the world\u2019s only superpower. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a mother, it bothers me that I lent my son to the army and they didn\u2019t give him back to me</p> <footer> <cite>Deanna Baxam</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She was caught between two utterly bewildering worlds, and her initial reaction was one of disbelief. This didn\u2019t happen to a family like hers. \u201cI thought our family did everything right, everything that would keep us out of the government\u2019s clutches,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Deanna was born in Nebraska, a US citizen, but she was raised in Jamaica to Jamaican parents. She returned to the US after completing her chemistry degree and went on to marry Carl Baxam, an American Trinidadian who worked for a defense contractor. They had two sons, the youngest of whom, Craig, was born in 1987.</p> <p>There was always something special about Craig, she said. He was creative, outgoing, smart. He also had an obsessional quality, as smart kids often do. Passions would flare up, burn brightly and then fizzle out in quick succession. \u201cOne day when he was about 10, he wanted to learn Hangul, so he visited our Korean neighbors every day \u2013 he was a real pest. That was typical: he wanted to learn the piano so he would go at it for days and days, and then it was done.\u201d</p> <p>Along with that intensity came what she describes as a purist streak. \u201cThere was no grey for him: it was either black or white, right or wrong. Nothing in between. When things were shoved into the in-between, he couldn\u2019t deal with it.\u201d</p> <p>There were other difficulties. He once said to his mother he thought he had attention deficit disorder, though she couldn\u2019t see it. He also took the divorce of his parents badly. They separated when Craig was eight years old and a few years after that Deanna moved away from Maryland to New Jersey, leaving her son largely in the care of his father. </p> <p>The internal struggle reflected itself in Craig\u2019s education. He flunked out of college before the end of freshman year, and then flunked out of community college. Deanna kept asking him what he was going to do with his life, a question which he answered, to her shock and dismay, by signing up for the US military. He enlisted in 2007, telling Deanna that he wanted to defend America in the wake of 9/11. After eight months\u2019 training in advanced cryptology and intelligence, he was posted to Baghdad. </p> <p>Until he joined the army, Craig had been what his mother describes as \u201cvery clean. Didn\u2019t drink or do drugs. Never. He had never been in trouble of any kind and had no criminal convictions or arrest record.\u201d She doesn\u2019t know what happened to him in Iraq \u2013 to this day he refuses to talk about it \u2013 but she does know that he came back a changed person.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"56374f1fbe391511c34791372ea698983fcfe27e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56374f1fbe391511c34791372ea698983fcfe27e/0_346_1372_1945/705.jpg\" alt=\"Craig Baxam at Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, Texas, in 2007.\" width=\"705\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Craig Baxam at Goodfellow air force base in San Angelo, Texas, in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Deanna Baxam</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs a mother, it bothers me that I lent my son to the army and they didn\u2019t give him back to me. I still don\u2019t have him back. I raised nice, middle-class children, sent them to music lessons, Catholic school, and then he just came back different.\u201d </p> <p>Having never smoked, Craig now consumed cigarettes, marijuana and K2 (synthetic marijuana, which at the time of his arrest was a legal substance). He began drinking heavily, another first.</p> <p>Deanna Baxam is convinced her son displayed classic PTSD symptoms. In between flashes of anger, he was withdrawn and disconnected. She had made his bedroom welcoming for his homecoming, but instead of sleeping in the new bed she\u2019d bought for him, he insisted on lying on the floor with his head on his service bag, as though he were still in the war zone.</p> <p>He signed up for one more tour of duty, this time to South Korea. The night before he was dispatched, she recalls that Craig would not move from a chair in the kitchen. \u201cI went to bed, and I left him sitting there in the chair in the dark all night. That wasn\u2019t right. There was something bad going on.\u201d</p> <p>Amid all this turbulence, Craig Baxam turned to the Muslim faith that was to become his salvation and his undoing. </p> <p>While stationed in South Korea, he began exploring religions. He would send his mother emails asking existential questions such as \u201cdo you believe there\u2019s only one God?\u201d or comparing Christianity with Islam. She was impressed and glad he was nurturing his spiritual side.</p> <p>But when he got off the plane on his return in July 2011, she knew something major had happened. He had grown a beard and was wearing a kufi and robe. She was stunned, and let it show. \u201cOh my God, what happened to you? Why would you even travel looking like that?\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m a Muslim now,\u201d he replied.</p> <p>She ran out of the airport, sat on a bench and cried.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the faith that distressed her: they had raised their children to be believers, and Deanna Baxam herself is a Pentecostal Christian. It was the feeling of abandonment.</p> <p>\u201cFaith is important to me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we raised them in a certain tradition, so to have him leave Christianity was like a rejection of the family. I was angry about it for a long time. I told him, \u2018I\u2019m as devout as you are, but we are on different tracks and you are separating our family.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>According to an <a href=\"http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/1874.pdf\">affidavit</a> given by an FBI agent, Craig Baxman converted about a week to 10 days before he quit the army in South Korea. There seems to have been no grooming involved by any individual or organization: Baxam had been surfing the internet and had come across a website that talked about the Day of Judgment \u2013 it spoke to him and made him hungry for more. Almost instantly he was praying five times a day and devouring books on Islam.</p> <p>Back in the US, he regularly tried to convert his own mother, too. Sometimes he would say to her: \u201cMom, I respect your right to have different faith, but I\u2019m worried you are going to hell when you die.\u201d</p> <p>She tried to be as accepting as she could, hoping that his new obsession would fade away. It didn\u2019t. In December 2011 she got a call from Craig\u2019s father saying that her son had disappeared.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a9db3dd80a964c3d58a557fa3c369e9afc9b85f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a9db3dd80a964c3d58a557fa3c369e9afc9b85f/0_0_4483_3225/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A copy of the Initial Entry Training Soldier\u2019s Handbook belonging to former US soldier Craig Baxam.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"719\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A copy of the Initial Entry Training Soldier\u2019s Handbook belonging to the former US soldier Craig Baxam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bita Honarvar/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/04/somalia-al-shabaab-insurgency-mogadishu-mohamed-nur\">Al-Shabaab</a> is one of the world\u2019s most feared Islamist militant groups. Since Craig Baxam\u2019s attempt to live under its control, the extremists have carried out some of the most brutal terrorist attacks in living memory, including the 2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/24/kenya-mall-hostage-westgate-nairobi\">Westgate mall attack</a> in Nairobi in which at least 67 people were killed.<br></p> <p>The group emerged in about 2006 out of the anarchy and chaos that has gripped Somalia, a \u201cfailed state\u201d. At the time that Baxam was making his way through Kenya, carrying only a few hundred dollars in his pocket, a prayer mat and a copy of the Qu\u2019ran, al-Shabaab militants<strong> </strong>were being forced out of the Somali capital Mogadishu but were still in control of large swathes of the south of the country.</p> <p>It was these al-Shabaab-controlled areas of Somalia that Craig Baxam was determined to reach. Using the internet, he had identified three places in the world where, in his view, a Muslim could conform fully to the tenets of his new religion under sharia law. <br></p> <p>The trio of locations that he chose as his possible future havens are among the harshest environments \u2013 both physically and spiritually \u2013 on the globe. They were the Taliban-controlled parts of Afghanistan; the southern islands of the Philippines, where an extremist group was trying to gain a foothold on Mindanao; and the al-Shabaab parts of Somalia.</p> <p>US prosecutors presented in court documents a psychological profile of Baxam in which they alleged that he had been aware of al-Shabaab\u2019s terrorist designation and the insurgency it was actively fighting at the time within Somalia. Based on interrogations with him while he was held captive by Kenyan police with FBI agents in attendance, they claimed that he had become hostile towards America, which he regarded as oppressive to Muslims.</p> <p>\u201cTo live as a Muslim in the US you need to compromise,\u201d the FBI agent\u2019s affidavit said, paraphrasing Craig Baxam\u2019s alleged position. \u201cHe finds the constant playing of music and display of pictures disrespectful. Only Allah can create images.\u201d</p> <p>The affidavit went on to allege that Baxam was prepared to take up arms and fight against the US if it attacked al-Shabaab:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Baxam saw himself dying in Somalia. It might be from malaria or from being hit by a rocket. Only Allah could know. Baxam never intended to return from Somalia, he was \u2018looking for dying with a gun in my hand\u2019. He would be happy to die defending Islam; being mowed down or hit with a cruise missile. If someone dies defending Islam, they are guaranteed a place in Jannah [paradise].</p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s impossible to really know what was going through Craig Baxam\u2019s head as he was making his fateful journey. In a recent letter to the Guardian from his current prison cell in Beaumont, Texas, he declined to be interviewed, writing that \u201cdespite the grief the US government has caused me, I am a private man and I also consider what happened to me to be far more insignificant than other cases\u201d.</p> <p>But there are clues that suggest that the US prosecutors\u2019 account of his intentions was overblown. The federal judge assigned to the case, Frederick Motz, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3147999-OrderReBillofParticulars.html\">cast doubt</a> on the state\u2019s claim that Baxam had terrorist inclinations. </p> <p>\u201cAccording to what he told FBI agents,\u201d Motz wrote in a court memo, \u201cit appears to me that defendant had not formed an intention to fight for al-Shabaab in any offensive capacity when he travelled to Somalia. To the contrary, all the statements seem to reveal is that defendant wanted to live in a Muslim country under Sharia law and that if the country in which he was residing was attacked, he would then defend that country.\u201d </p> <p>For Deanna Baxam, the account given by the state \u2013 that her son was a callous terrorist-sympathiser intent on betraying his own country \u2013 just didn\u2019t ring true. As she sees it, it was his innate purist streak that was leading him on, not any political sensibility. \u201cHe believed that the Qu\u2019ran says that if you live in an oppressive regime where Islam is not in control, like America, then you should make hijrah. So he set off for Somalia.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97833dfc1ef4021f05b05cb6517acf939ab0afba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97833dfc1ef4021f05b05cb6517acf939ab0afba/0_0_1260_1666/756.jpg\" alt=\"A letter from Baxam to his mother.\" width=\"756\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A letter from Baxam to his mother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Deanna Baxam</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A mother is not the most dispassionate witness. But Deanna Baxam also has a lawyer\u2019s eye, having retrained in law several years ago. She has identified aspects of the case that make her deeply uneasy about the justice served. There were the 11 days between her son\u2019s arrest on the bus in northern Kenya, and his return to US soil \u2013 what happened in that period, how many times was he interrogated, and what role did the FBI play in the process? Why were none of the interrogations recorded on tape so that the FBI\u2019s account of what her son told them could be verified?<br></p> <p>She is alarmed by the fact that her own government deployed its considerable resources to track and detain her child on foreign soil. Instead of providing him with the care he needed as a disturbed veteran who had seen tours of duty in Iraq and South Korea and displayed symptoms of PTSD, they left him to his own devices.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know any of this stuff happened,\u201d she said. \u201cThey track US nationals in Kenya? To say I\u2019m outraged doesn\u2019t seem enough of a response. When you are a US national overseas I thought the job of the government was to help protect you, not to collaborate with the Kenyan authorities in tracking you down.\u201d</p> <p>She is also dismayed by what she believes was the willful denial of her son\u2019s first amendment right to practice his religion. \u201cAmerica has a history of interning the Japanese, of persecuting people because of their religious beliefs. How is that different here? How can we imprison somebody who has no demonstrated guilty intent or action \u2013 there was none of that? And yet he is rounded up and sent to prison.\u201d</p> <p>Craig Baxam was sentenced in January 2014 to seven years in prison, with five years of post-prison supervision added on. The sentence flowed from a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3147998-Plea-Agreement-Baxam-Copy.html\">plea bargain</a> in which the US government agreed to drop the main terrorist charges against him in return for a guilty plea to a lesser charge: that he had knowingly disposed of records that could be used in a terrorism investigation. Before leaving for Kenya, he had destroyed his personal computer and thrown it in a dumpster, allegedly to foil any future FBI probe.</p> <p>Today, Craig Baxam, now 29, is approaching his fifth anniversary behind bars, some of which time he has spent in solitary confinement. </p> <p>His father, Carl Baxam, lost his job with the defense contractor after 24 years of loyal service once news of the case broke. Carl died last year while Craig was still in prison.</p> <p>Deanna Baxam had to change the church in which she worshipped because she felt stigmatized by others in the congregation. She lost a few corporate contracts as a lawyer, as well as some professional friendships, after people dropped out of sight without saying a word. </p> <p>She says she still wrestles with the fallout of it all. She travels to visit her son whenever she can, and they exchange letters regularly. In his correspondence and phone calls, Craig continues to talk about Islam fervently, and makes clear that his long-term goal remains to live under sharia law, though no longer in Somalia. </p> <p>He signs his letters \u201cEsmail the American\u201d. In them, he\u2019ll weave in and out of a discussion of his faith. Allah will appear in one sentence, a joke about his mother\u2019s basketball team the Chicago Bulls the next. From time to time, he\u2019ll make another stab at getting Deanna to convert to Islam. </p> <p>As a mother, she has had to accept that there\u2019s a side to her son that is now beyond her reach. \u201cThere is a part of me that says, \u2018How could this have happened, what would make you so driven that you would want to go and live with al-Shabaab?\u2019 I can\u2019t understand that.\u201d</p> <p>She has tried to reach out to other mothers in her position, so far without success. \u201cPeople want to stay underground,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, who wants to be known as the \u2018mother of a terrorist\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>If she had the chance to send a message to other mothers like her, trapped between religious fundamentalism and an overweaning government, what would she say? </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d say: \u2018You are not alone. What has happened to you is beyond your imagination. But you are not alone.\u2019\u201d</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 25 October 2016 to correct the spelling of Craig Baxam\u2019s father\u2019s surname.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><em>No billionaire owner, no shareholders.
