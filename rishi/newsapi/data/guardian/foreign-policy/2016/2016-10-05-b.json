The American people want to see our people standing tall again... and Donald Trump\u2019s entire career has been about building... finding a way... to fight forward.

He opposed it based on religion. \u201cBut I know how to take an oath and uphold the law... it was very very difficult to allow an execution to go forward... that was a real struggle\u201d but people of faith can\u2019t just substitute their own views on everyone.</p> <p>Pence: Wonderful question. \u201cMy Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am.\u201d We went to church and had grace. \u201cWith my wife at my side, we followed the calling into public service.\u201d I have a great deal of respect for senator Kaine\u2019s sincere faith.

Still Pence talking here. \u201cI like to spend a little bit of time on my knees every day.\u201d</p> <p>Kaine: \u201cThis is a fundamental question... we really feel that it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else... we support Roe v Wade... the constitutional right of American woman to... make their own decision about pregnancy. We trust American women to do that. And we don\u2019t think that women as Donald Trump said should be punished.. \u201c Pence wants to overturn Roe.. \u201cThe very last thing that government should do is to make laws that would punish women.\u201d And that \u201cis the </p> <p>Pence: \u201cDonald Trump and I\u201d don\u2019t favor punishing women for abortion.</p> <p>Kaine: Trump said he did.</p> <p>Pence: \u201cHe\u2019s not a polished politician.\u201d</p> <p>Kaine: The gospel of Matthew says, \u201cFrom the fullness of the heart the mouth speaks.\u201d So Trump meant it.

He was pressed on this support in an interview with O\u2019Reilly, who himself called the operation \u201c<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/donald-trump-immigration-deportation-215783\">really brutal</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWell, well, I\u2019ve heard it both ways. I\u2019ve heard good reports, I\u2019ve heard bad reports,\u201d Trump told the Fox News host. \u201cWe would do it in a very humane way.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump has given mixed messages since his<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-60-minutes-scott-pelley/\"> early calls</a> for mass deportation, and he has used the phrase <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/watch/trump-vows-to-deport-11-million-people-564859459935\">\u201cdeportation force\u201d</a>. In August of this year, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">appeared to have doubts, </a>until finally promising<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech\"> \u201cno amnesty\u201d and a \u201chumane\u201d removal </a>of migrants.</p> <p><strong>Kaine: the nuclear deal with Iran has prevented Tehran from developing weapons</strong></p> <p>The nuclear deal with Iran was finalized in July 2015, three years after the end of Clinton\u2019s term as secretary of state, and it does not completely remove Iran\u2019s nuclear program. It removes a reserve of medium-enriched uranium, cuts into its low-enriched uranium, and allows access to international inspectors.</p> <p>Kaine also appears to exaggerate how quickly Iran could have developed a bomb. During negotiations, intelligence officials and analysts said they believed Iran was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal.html\">two to three months</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html\">away from bomb capabilities</a>. The terms of the deal extend that \u201cbreakout\u201d ability to a year, and have restrictions extending over 10, 15 and 25 years.</p> <p><strong>Pence: the US doesn\u2019t know who Syrian refugees are and should block them</strong></p> <p>The government has a fairly clear idea about how many people are in the US without legal authorization. Using data from the Census, Department of Homeland Security, Office of Refugee Resettlement and surveys and analysis from Mexico and Latin American countries, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics-publications\">the DHS</a> and nonpartisan <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/19/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/\">Pew Research</a> have each been able to estimate the number, and arrived at similar figures in recent years: around 11.3 to 11.5 million people. The margin of error for these figures is generally around a million people at most \u2013 not 20 million as Trump says.</p> <p>Pew and the DHS both try to account for deaths, under-counted groups, arrivals and departures, and have adjusted their calculations based on decades\u2019 worth of research. Both have found that net migration has stabilized in recent years, and that <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/11/19/more-mexicans-leaving-than-coming-to-the-u-s/\">more undocumented Mexicans are leaving</a> the US than entering it. In other words, recent net migration into the US has hovered near its lowest levels of the last 20 years.</p> <p><strong>Kaine: blocking Syrian refugees is unconstitutional</strong></p> <p>On Monday, the seventh circuit court of appeals accused Pence of baseless \u201cnightmare speculation\u201d and compared the governor\u2019s attempt to block refugees to an attempt to exclude black people from his state, Indiana. Pence tried to deny 174 refugees resettlement aid, and the case was taken to court.</p> <p>\u201cThe governor of Indiana believes, though without evidence, that some of these persons were sent to Syria by ISIS to engage in terrorism and now wish to infiltrate the United States in order to commit terrorist acts here.

While I would hope all of our children would aspire to be president, neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton have set a good example and I wouldn\u2019t hold up either of them as role models for my kids,\u201d she said.<br><br>At the weekend Ayotte had struck a more moderate tone, giving away free condoms on the campaign trail to push her plan on birth control. The poster at the event claimed to \u201cUse Condom Sense!\u201d </p> <p>Ayotte is in a close race with Democratic governor Maggie Hassan, who was endorsed by Planned Parenthood, Emily\u2019s List and NARAL. While it\u2019s unusual for a Republican to favor contraception, Ayotte is certainly attempting to appeal to women by pivoting from traditional party platforms. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-04T14:54:42.435Z\">at 3.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f3b9c3e4b05e7633c585e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-04T14:16:54.541Z\">3.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The VP debate takes place at Longwood University in Virginia tonight and the marching band is already warming up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KellyO/status/783302959610400768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hey we&#39;ve got a band!

Even as partisans view Pence and Kaine with disdain for their positions on various social and economic issues, many voters still see them both as more personally appealing than Clinton and Trump, which is empirically the lowest bar in modern presidential campaign history.</p> <p>But just because the VP debate is likely to be more of a wonkfest than a rhetorical slugfest doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t a potential for fireworks. There is \u2013 though mainly at the expense of Mike Pence.<br></p> <p>Pence took a risk when he joined the Republican ticket. The Indiana governor tied his political fortunes to an erratic, orange-haired huckster. The upside was he got an escape from a competitive re-election race and, if Trump wins, would be one heartbeat away from the presidency. The downside is that his political career will forever be marred by his connection to a guy who goes around claiming his political rival\u2019s father may have been an <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/05/trump-ted-cruz-father-222730\">accomplice</a> in the JFK assassination.</p> <p>Pence has been forced to defend some pretty un-Pence-like statements during his time connected with Trump, <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/raddatz-grills-pence-why-did-trump-keep-birtherism-going-for-so-long/\">such as</a> Trump\u2019s half-decade-long birther crusade.
