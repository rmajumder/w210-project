  "<p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission has said \"significant\" material about the death of Mark Duggan has emerged in recent weeks, meaning its report into his shooting by police will be delayed even further.</p> <p>The report into the shooting, which triggered the 2011 English riots, was due to be completed this summer. On Tuesday the IPCC told a pre-inquest hearing that it could not say when its investigation would be finished.</p> <p>The new evidence emerged at the trial of a man accused of supplying Duggan with a gun, which ended last week with the jury deadlocked.</p> <p>Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, 30, denied the charge of \"selling or transferring a prohibited firearm\" to Duggan, who was shot in Tottenham, north London, on 4 August. He will face a retrial.</p> <p>Robin Tam QC, for the IPCC, told the coroner, Andrew Walker, that the new material would have to be assessed by investigators.</p> <p>The trial of Hutchinson-Foster heard from officers who stopped Duggan, and the marksman who killed him. The new material is believed to relate to their evidence and cross-examination by defence counsel. The trial was the first time the officers had answered questions about the shooting, after they declined to answer oral questions from the IPCC, providing written statements instead.</p> <p>The officers are being treated as witnesses by the IPCC inquiry, not as suspects.</p> <p>Walker ruled that the inquest would start as planned on 28 January 2013, some 17 months after the shooting, a decision that pleased the Duggan family.</p> <p>But the retrial of Hutchinson-Foster is yet to be scheduled and if it is not completed by the time the Duggan inquest is due to start, the coroner may have to wait.</p> <p>After the pre-inquest review hearing at North London coroner's court, Duggan's brother Shaun Hall said: \"It's the first time that we have left here with a bit of hope that we can get the truth. We are told that in January we are going to get our day in court.</p> <p>\"The coroner was not prepared to lie down. He does want to see this in front of a jury as we do. All we are looking for is the truth.\"</p> <p>In court, the family's barrister Michael Mansfield said they felt a \"deep sense of injustice\" over widely publicised accounts of Duggan's death which emerged during the trial of Hutchinson-Foster.</p> <p>The trial at Snaresbrook crown court heard the marksman who shot Duggan said he had \"absolutely no doubt\" the 29-year-old was holding a gun and preparing to fire.</p> <p>The officer, known only as V53, said his account of the shooting was compiled three days later, when he and his colleagues spent more than eight hours sitting in a room together writing their statements. He said they were aware of the rules about officers conferring and had discussed the incident among themselves before writing their statements.</p> <p>Hutchinson-Foster's defence was that he had not passed the gun to Duggan and that the jury could not be sure the evidence from police officers was correct.</p> <p>The Duggan family also fear an attempt may be made to hold the hearing without a jury because of \"secret evidence\" relating to intercepts, but so far no formal or public attempt has been made to do this.</p>"
