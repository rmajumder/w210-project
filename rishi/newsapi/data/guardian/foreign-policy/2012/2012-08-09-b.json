  "<p>The victims of the Sikh temple shootings in Wisconsin have been remembered at a series of solemn events across the US, as people gathered to urge religious tolerance and greater gun controls.</p> <p>In New York, hundreds took part in a candlelight vigil in Union Square honouring the six people killed by Wade Michael Page at the Wisconsin Sikh Temple in Oak Creek on Sunday. It was a scene that played out across the US as people came together to remember those caught up in America's latest shooting atrocity and to urge political leaders to act.</p> <p>The event in New York was coordinated by the Manhattan Sikh Association and began around 7.30pm ET. Organizers handed out dark blue bandanas for attendees to cover their heads, white T-shirts that read \"We Are All Sikhs\" and hundreds of small electronic candles.</p> <p>As six people stood in a line and each held a photo of an Oak Creek victim with their name below, a series of interfaith speakers took the podium to urge an elimination of religion-based discrimination and push for gun control in the hopes of preventing further hate crimes.</p> <p>\"It's so easy to come together when there's a terrible tragedy. It's more difficult to come together when things are going well because we get caught up in our day-to-day lives, we re-erect the walls that separate us and we wait until the next tragedy,\" said one of the speakers, a rabbi.</p> <p>Near him, a woman draped in an American flag head covering stood silently as he spoke. \"Well, it can't be that way any more,\" the rabbi continued. \"It's really time to demonstrate every day \u2013 not just on a terrible day like today \u2013 to demonstrate every day that we are one, that we are in this together, that our skin colours, that our religion and our nation of origin is meaningless in the face of our unified humanity.\"</p> <p>Near the end of the vigil, with the plaza at Union Square nearly filled, supporters were asked for a moment of silence to remember each of the victims. At that point, they turned on their electronic candles and lifted them up against the night sky in a show of nationwide solidarity.</p> <p>Similar scenes were witnessed across the US as people continued to commemorate the victims. Scores of Sikh temples took part in vigils on Wednesday. In Michigan, 500 people gathered at a gurdwada in the Detroit suburb of Plymouth.</p> <p>Sikh places of worship opened their doors to those previously unfamiliar to the tenets of the faith, with a temple in San Jose among many that gave newcomers required head coverings.</p> <p>The vigils began earlier this week. On Tuesday, residents of Oak Creek turned out in their hundreds to join members of the Sikh community at the site of the shootings. At that event, local police chief John Edwards addressed those gathered, telling them that he was struck by the reaction of the temple-goers, in their lack of hatred and focus on \"compassion, concern and support\".</p> <p>The calls for calm and understanding come despite an emerging picture of the killer as a man driven by racial hatred. Page, a former US soldier who had been kicked out of the army for being drunk on duty and going absent without leave, was a member of the white power music scene.</p> <p>He sometimes performed with a Nazi swastika hanging behind the group, and his first band, Definite Hate, produced an album called Violent Victory, with a cover design of a white fist punching a black face.</p> <p>Community leaders are scheduled to hold more unity events at cities across America on Thursday evening.</p> <p>On its Facebook page, Punjabi Radio USA, which is helping publicise the vigils, urged: \"Now is the time to show the world that we as human beings can rise above the ignorance and violence that still exists today. Now is the time to come together in peace and solidarity. Now is the time to stand against hatred towards anyone.\"</p>"
