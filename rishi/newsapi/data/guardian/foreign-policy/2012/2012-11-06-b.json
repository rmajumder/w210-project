Who will robocall what lie, what machine will break, <strong>who will <em>steal the election</em></strong> in any of the few remaining battleground states? One YouTube of a voting machine not registering someone's Obama vote, and everyone's on edge all day.</p> <p>In Fairfax, Virginia, the largest county in the state that sits along the red-blue line dividing \"Old Virginia\" \u2013 Southern, white \u2013 from \"New Virginia\" \u2013 young people, professionals, yuppies, minorities, and other non-Real Americans \u2013 the elementary schools that serve as polling stations are enveloped in surveillance. What if there's some kind of organized racket or voting machine issue that screws up the tally in one of the most important counties in the country? It would only be surprising if someone didn't give it a shot.</p> <p>So that's why outside of Mosby Woods School in the residential town of Vienna, Virginia, the end of the DC Metro's Orange subway line, we weren't the only ones waiting to badger voters as they tried to perform their civic duty in peace and quiet.</p> <p>Three Republican party volunteers greeted all incoming voters with sample-ballots. Voters were then handed off to an Asian-American voters' activist, who ensured that members of this large international community in Fairfax had everything in order and understood where they needed to go.</p> <p>Two poll watchers, at the door, and more along the way, through the long line that was about to get much longer as the workday ended.</p> <p>And then, when they exited, two other Asian-American voters' activists offering surveys in at least Chinese and Korean \u2013 one voter requested Tibetan \u2013 followed by a voting machine monitor to keep track of malfunctions, and lastly, a Guardian reporter asking them personal questions about their politics, for publication.</p> <p>We chose to visit Mosby Woods after reading an early-day blurb about a voting machine failure there. Was this a scandalous failure, designed to suppress the Asian-American vote which went 62% nationally for President Obama in 2008? Was someone <em>stealing the election at this very elementary school?</em></p> <p>Nope. The voting machine monitor explained that the thing just had a glitch, or stalled for a minute. It slowed down the process, briefly, but the flow of voters resumed shortly afterwards. Not a big deal, at all.</p> <p>Now where's the fun in that, when every glitch reported across the country doesn't turn out to be a breathtaking scandal?</p> <p><em>Jim Newell</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-06T22:43:43.528Z\">at 10.43pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50999062b579f74bac764bba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-06T22:34:10.699Z\">10.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>What happened to the supposed falloff in <strong>voter enthusiasm</strong> from 2008?

I first thought the calibration was off and tried selecting Jill Stein to actually highlight Obama. Nope. Jill Stein was selected just fine. Next I deselected her and started at the top of Romney's name and started tapping very closely together to find the 'active areas'. From the top of Romney's button down to the bottom of the black checkbox beside Obama's name was all active for Romney. From the bottom of that same checkbox to the bottom of the Obama button (basically a small white sliver) is what let me choose Obama. Stein's button was fine. All other buttons worked fine.</p> <p>I asked the voters on either side of me if they had any problems and they reported they did not. I then called over a volunteer to have a look at it. She him hawed for a bit then calmly said \"It's nothing to worry about, everything will be OK.\" and went back to what she was doing. I then recorded this video.</p> <p>There is a lot of speculation that the footage is edited. I'm not a video guy, but if it's possible to prove whether a video has been altered or not, I will GLADLY provide the raw footage to anyone who is willing to do so.

For every inch above normal rainfall, overall turnout drops by a little less than 1%, but Democratic turnout drops by 2.5%. Every inch above average snowfall decreases turnout by 0.5%. Since the water equivalent of 10 inches of snow usually equals an inch of rain, it's more likely snow will effect an election. [...]</p> <p>Florida is the one state where rain could change have more an impact. There will be showers in the northern half of the state including the key I-4 corridor. Even so, the race would have to be about a point to a point and a half tighter than polling average for the weather to have an effect.</p> </blockquote> <p>Harry takes a more in-depth look at the forecasts for different parts of 10 swing states <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/06/election-day-weather-forecast-florida\">here</a>. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-509927dab579f74bac764b8d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-06T15:08:10.246Z\">3.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>The Guardian's Ed Pilkington is in <strong>Cheviot, Ohio</strong>, a suburb of Cincinnati in Hamilton county in the south-west of the state:</em></p> <p>Carol Ann McIlmurray, 56, is precisely the kind of person Romney needs to attract in large numbers here today.

Richard reported last night at midnight:</p> <p>In <strong>Dixville Notch, </strong>we have the presidential vote from the 10 electors, and the precinct captain announces:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This has never happened before in Dixville, we have a tie, five votes each.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now there's an omen for America. Except that Dixville has two registered Democrats, three registered Republicans, and five registered independents. So, ah, Obama won indies 60% to 40%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-5bae89f7-8dbb-4e39-bca9-d49e4ea6aac5\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/6/1352209778933/812233fe-62b8-4b43-9341-3552ec59f53d-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Villagers in Dixville Notch cast votes just after midnight, kicking off U.S. presidential elections  US election, Dixville Notch, New Hampshire.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Villagers in Dixville Notch cast votes just after midnight, kicking off U.S. presidential elections, Dixville Notch, New Hampshire.

Most residents of the White Mountain village then were railroad workers who had to be on the job during normal polling hours. By 1964 the townspeople had grown weary of the media attention and the late hours and did away with the practice. They revived it in 1996.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Richard Adams</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-06T14:09:28.088Z\">at 2.09pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5099148ab579f74bac764b7b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-06T13:45:46.387Z\">1.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Guardian animation expert Greg Chen, politics blogger Richard Adams and copy editor Erin McCann have collaborated on a stunning <strong>animated graphic novel</strong> telling the story of the campaign.

But others were allowed to stand, including the cutting of the number of days for early voting which contributed to the huge queues that meant some people <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/05/campaigns-legal-battles-swing-states\">waited more than eight hours to cast a ballot</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Republicans say the new measures were necessary to combat fraud. But as the American Civil Liberties Union has noted, more people are attacked by sharks in Florida than convicted of election fraud.&#xa0;That has helped fire up some of the president's supporters who see Florida's Republican party machinations as trampling on their democratic rights.&#xa0;</p> <p>But many Republicans who declined to vote for John McCain four years ago because he was not conservative enough, care less about the candidate they will be supporting this time than the opportunity to get rid of Obama. The place to watch \u2013 and where I will be \u2013 is Hillsborough county, around the Tampa area. Where it goes, Florida goes. In 2004, George Bush won the county by 3%. Four years later, Obama took it by the same margin.&#xa0;</p> <p>The polling stations are likely to be less of an ordeal for voters, in part because there are many more polling stations on election day proper than for early voting.&#xa0;The weather's horrible though.

What happens here today could well determine the outcome of the whole presidential race: Mitt Romney really needs to win this state if he is to have a chance of unseating Barack Obama from the White House.</p> <p>I'm going to spend today on a triangular journey through the electoral landscape of one large section of the state to sample its diversity of political complexion. There's going to be a lot of driving involved across Ohio's monotonously flat plains, but I'll be counting on country music and the rants of Rush Limbaugh on talk radio to keep me going.</p> <p>First stop is a suburb of Cincinnati, one of Romney's most crucial target areas and where Obama campaigned Sunday (see picture below). This area is traditionally very conservative, the heartland of Ohio's God-fearing, straight-living south-western people. But in 2008 Obama became only the second Democratic presidential candidate to win in Hamilton county in which Cincinnati is situated since Lyndon Johnson in 1964.</p> <p>After that, it's a two-hour drive due north to Greenville, a country town in the rural west of Ohio. This is pure Republican country, dependable and unwavering. McCain swept Darke county in which Greenville is located by a resounding 68% to Obama's 30%.</p> <p>The outcome here is not in doubt \u2013 for such a deep red county to turn blue would require a magician to pour some potent liberal potion into the local drinking water. But it will be interesting to see how dyed-in-the-wool conservatives are feeling about Romney's prospects, and the future of the country if he loses tonight.</p> <p>Then I will cut across country due east to the state capital, Columbus. The city is very mixed politically. It has a buzzing university scene as home to Ohio state university, which lends it a lot of Democratic-voting young people. In 2008 Obama won Franklin county around Columbus handsomely, by 59% to McCain's 40%.</p> <p>But the city also acts as the state's main financial centre and has a deep conservative tradition. I'll go to a polling station in a northern suburb, where political opinion is very mixed to take soundings there about which way the wind is blowing.</p> <p><em>Ed Pilkington in Cincinnati</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1468dee4-e522-4638-9e06-3a9ee2c297c8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/6/1352207674001/4de6e7c6-bc92-4f8a-9331-b0ecbfa5555b-460.jpeg\" alt=\"President Barack Obama greets supporters as he arrives at a campaign rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, on 4 November, 2012.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Barack Obama greets supporters as he arrives at a campaign rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Sunday.

And welcome to our election day live blog.</strong> After 523 days on the trail for Mitt Romney, 101 campaign rallies for Barack Obama and <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2012/10/2012-election-spending-will-reach-6.html\">more than $6bn</a> in campaign spending from all directions, the day has finally arrived. About 100 million Americans are going to enter a booth or lean over a machine and vote today (<a href=\"http://elections.gmu.edu/early_vote_2012.html\">nearly 32 million</a> have voted already). With any luck we'll know who the winner is sometime tonight.</p> <p>Every presidential election is significant. That's true of this one, only more so. The candidates have described sharply contrasting plans to strengthen the economy, secure the nation and attack the debt. They are beholden to constituencies with radically different visions of what an ideal American society would look like, what rights it would guarantee and what laws it would enforce. Apart from the alma mater they share, the candidates differ in their life stories and as men, in their casts of mind, in their approaches to problems and to people. Both are outsiders, in their ways. After today's election, the story of each man will be rewritten for good. As will the country's.</p> <p><strong>Our correspondents are on the ground in eight battleground states to cover the action at the polls.</strong> We'll be talking to voters all day long to find out how they cast their ballots and why. We'll watch out for polling station delays or irregularities. We'll also keep an eye on the campaigns as team Obama hunkers down in Chicago and team Romney skips from Cleveland to Pittsburgh to Boston.</p> <p><strong><strong>The first polls close tonight at 6pm ET and </strong>we'll be bringing you comprehensive coverage of the results as they come in.</strong> Polls close in the key swing state of Ohio at 7.30 pm ET, although results out of there are not likely to be announced until hours later. A list of poll closure times <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/nov/06/time-states-election-results-us#data\">is here.</a></p> <p>Who do you think is going to win the race to 270 electoral votes \u2013 and what will the final result be? Our electoral tracker shows Obama with 247 \"safe\" electoral votes and Romney with 191. There are eight states up for grabs, in our model. Think you know which way Ohio will go, or Florida?
