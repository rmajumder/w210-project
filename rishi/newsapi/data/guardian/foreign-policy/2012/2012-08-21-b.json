  "<p>Can Prince Philip perhaps be forgiven a little? For being such a rude bugger, and not always saying the right thing? No, no excuses?</p> <p>But he did have a difficult childhood, as we learn in <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-queens-mother-in-law\" title=\"\"><strong>The Queen's Mother in Law</strong></a> (Channel 4). Philip's mum, Alice of Battenberg, was a bit German and a bit British (Queen Victoria was her great grandmother) and she married Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark (lord knows why they came as a package). It was different in those days \u2013 there was no Mahiki or wherever they now go to meet potential partners, so the royal houses of Europe paired off among each other, even though they were all cousins. And because they were so inbred they were too stupid to get into St Andrews University so they couldn't meet fit commoners/non-rellies that way. It was a difficult cycle to break out of. Alice, incidentally, was congenitally deaf.</p> <p>Anyway, after the Greco-Turkish war, Andrew and Alice were kicked out of Greece with their five children \u2013 four girls, who would marry Germans who later served under Hitler in the second world war. And Phil the Greek, who served in the British navy, before copping off with our Brenda. Oh, and Alice was back in occupied Greece during the war, rescuing Jews from the Nazis, a kind of mini-Schindler, albeit with a much shorter list. Complicated huh? Like one of those Liverpool families that is half red, half blue \u2013 possibly even more complicated.</p> <p>That's jumping the gun, though. Because first Alice has to go mad. Which she did with gusto and aplomb. She thought she was having sexual relationships not just with Jesus Christ but with Buddha too. Husband Prince Andrew (of Greece and Denmark, keep up), unprepared to share his missus with the founders of any major world religions \u2013 and also because he's a bit of a cad, to be honest \u2013 legged it to the French Riviera for a lazy life of sunshine and mistresses. And Alice \u2013 on the instructions of her mother \u2013 was locked up in an asylum. Here, on the recommendation of Sigmund Freud, she had her ovaries X-rayed, because they thought that accelerating the menopause would cure her. These same people were also transplanting the testicles of gay men, in order to cure them of their gayness. Bloody idiots.</p> <p>Back to poor Philip then. He came home from a picnic one day to find that his deluded mum had been locked away, and his dad had skedaddled. So he was sent to boarding school in England, and was passed around among aristocratic rellies in the holidays, before joining the navy to fight against the Nazis who were married to his sisters. Then he met the future Queen of England, his future wife (and third cousin).</p> <p>They were reunited later, Philip and his mother. Alice, now a nun and (marginally) less mad, came to live in Buckingham Palace, where she wandered the corridors, sucking on a Woodbine. \"Wonderful, isn't it?\" says Giles Brandreth. It is, yes, all of it, an amazing story. Also wonderful are all the old trouts who come out from under their rocks to talk about it. Not just Giles, but also Countess Mountbatten, Lady Pamela So-and-So etc. Lovely.</p> <p>It's a shame that Jack Whitehall has thrown everything at his own character in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00vrlrh\" title=\"\"><strong>Bad Education</strong></a> (BBC3), and more or less forgotten about everyone else. Michelle Gomez, star of Green Wing and such a hilarious physical comic actor, is unforgivably underused. I'd also like to see more of some of the kids who are brilliant \u2013 Chantelle the slag, camp Stephen, Grayson the bully (love the way he says \"shut up\"). That would give it more layers, more depth. It's all Jack's Alfie though. I guess that's what happens when the writer is also the star. Me me me me me.</p> <p>BUT \u2013 and it's a big, upper-case but \u2013 Bad Education is still fabulous, a very silly half-hour of anarchic inappropriate joy. With some lovely situations, and some lovely lines. \"Make a noise, like a girl having a crap,\" teacher Alfie orders pupil Joe, cowering in the girls' toilets, when the deputy goes into the next cubicle to empty a confiscated bottle of cider.</p> <p>Crucially, and probably because it's the creation of one guy, Bad Education has heaps of personality. It may be a flawed baby, but it's Whitehall's baby.</p> <p>The other new school-based sitcom, <a href=\"http://skyliving.sky.com/gates/sneak-peek-gates-episode-1-preview-video\" title=\"\"><strong>Gates</strong></a> (Sky Living) is the creation of five people. I know that can work with slick American shows, but this isn't one of them. It feels like comedy by committee, where compromises have been reached, and middle paths found. The result is it has almost zero personality. It's not awful, it's just a bit bland. Not joyous, not anarchic, not funny.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 22 August 2012 because an editing error led to Battenberg being misspelled as Battenburg. It was further amended on 24 August 2012 because the footnote appended on 22 August 2012 erred in saying that the original article had referred to Gordonstoun as a boarding school in England. In fact the original article referred only to Prince Philip being sent to boarding school in England. This is correct \u2013 he attended Cheam school, a boarding preparatory school then in Surrey, before becoming a pupil at Gordonstoun in Scotland \u2013 and so the reference to England has been restored to the article.</p>"
