  "<p>Indian relatives of the victims of the Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting have called on US authorities to release the bodies of the victims, as more details emerge of the dead and wounded.</p> <p>Most of those killed by Wade Michael Page, a 41-year-old army veteran, were Indian nationals; some were religious workers who had travelled from India, where the Sikh religion was founded in the 15th century.</p> <p>Investigators have said they are still trying to work out what motivated Page to carry out his attack on Sunday.</p> <p>Dr Harcharan Gill, a veterinarian and trustee of the Oak Tree temple, said the Wisconsin community was expecting families of the two injured victims, Punjab Singh and Santokh Singh, to arrive from Delhi on Tuesday.</p> <p>Gill, whose brother-in-law Satwant Singh Kaleka was among those killed, said Punjab Singh was seriously ill. \"Punjab Singh is very critical and has gone into a coma after undergoing surgery for his bullet wounds. He had arrived here just a few days ago,\" Gill said.</p> <p>He said Santokh Singh had been in the US for about three or four years, and was in the process of applying for a green card, so that his family could join him. He had traveled to India last month to visit his family in West Delhi.</p> <p>One woman, Parmjit Kaur Toor, 41, died on Sunday. The four men killed were Seeta Singh, 41; Parkash Singh, 49; Ranjit Singh, 39; and Subegh Singh, 84.</p> <p>The traveling religious workers who died, or were injured, would visit immigrant Sikh communities in America to help with duties such as reciting of the scriptures at the gurdwaras, and perform rituals in other community events like marriages. \"A morning prayer at the temple had got over at 10.20am, and just as these workers were coming out on a break, they found themselves in the face of Wade's gun attack\", said Gill.</p> <p>Two of those killed, Seeta Singh, 41, and Ranjit Singh, 39, were brothers. Gill said: \"Ranjit Singh had been here for many years, but his brother joined him recently, about four to five months ago.\" They are survived by their wives and children, who live in Delhi.</p> <p>The former president of the body that manages Delhi's gurdwaras, Harwinder Singh Sarna, who visited both bereaved families in Delhi on Tuesday, told the Guardian that they were struggling to make sense of Sunday's killings. He added an appeal for American authorities: \"We would request them to release the bodies of Ranjit Singh or Seeta Singh. If that is not possible, they should issue visas on an urgent basis for their families so that they can travel to the US and perform the last rites.\"</p> <p>Sarna said his organisation had announced financial assistance for the families, including a fund to meet the educational expenses of the children whose fathers died. The body also wishes to donate $5,000 to lieutenant Brian Murphy, the police officer who was seriously injured in the attack. Despite his injuries, Murphy tried to wave off assistance from other officers and directed them into the temple instead.</p> <p>\"We are very grateful to him for his courage and we will be very happy if he would accept this,\" Sarna said.</p> <p>Wade's oldest victim was Subegh Singh Khattra, 84, a wheat farmer from Punjab who emigrated to Wisconsin in 2004 to live with his son, Baljinder Singh Khattra.</p> <p>Baljinder, a taxi driver, who moved to America as a young immigrant in the mid-1990s, said he asked his aging parents to come and live with him so that he could take greater care of them. \"My father would go off to the gurdwara early every morning. He was devout, but that was also a place where he could meet other elderly members of the community, and escape being lonely and bored at home.\" Baljinder said he was yet to see his father's body. </p> <p>Baljinder's wife, Kulwant Kaur, who was at the temple during Sunday morning's attack, saw her father-in-law lying in the hallway, bleeding from a wound in his head, as she was being rescued by security officials responding to the attack.</p> <p>Baljinder said he was moved by the fact that all his neighbours, across various backgrounds, had reached out to his family since the tragedy, and offered solace. \"It was just one individual who lost his head that morning and committed this senseless killings. May God give his soul peace,\" he said.</p> <p>Wade's mother, Laura Lynn, has said she was devastated by her son's actions and that she apologised to the victims and the families. She told <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2184602/Wisconsin-temple-shooting-Devastated-mother-Sikh-temple-killer-Wade-Michael-Page-apologizes-sons-victims.html\">Mail Online</a>: \"He was such a precious little boy, that's all I can say. We was a very fun-loving, typical little boy. He was just a very soft spoken, gentle young man.\"</p> <p>Lynn said she had not been in contact with him in the 12 years since she and his father divorced.</p> <p>Investigators have said they are still ascertaining what exactly pushed Wade to open fire. The Southern Poverty Law Center said in a statement that Wade Michael Page was a member of two racist skinhead bands \u2013 End Apathy and Definite Hate, the latter a band whose album Violent Victory featured a drawing of a disembodied white arm punching a black man in the face.</p> <p>The fist is tattooed with the letters \"HFFH,\" the acronym for the phrase \"Hammerskins Forever, Forever Hammerskins.\" The Hammerskins is a nationwide skinhead organization with regional factions and chapters that once dominated the racist skinhead movement in the United States, the SPLC said.</p> <p>The killings have revived the debate over America's troubled relationship with guns, and now foreign nationals are weighing in, too. When US ambassador Nancy Powell visited one of Delhi's leading Sikh temples, the Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, on Monday, members gave her a written statement that dealt with gun control as well as prejudice against Sikhs living in the US.</p> <p>Sarna, who met Powell, said: \"Powell assured us that the US government would do its best to prevent such incidents from happening again in the future. But we are concerned about the gun culture and would ask the American authorities to try to curb this in their country. Innocent lives were lost in Colorado too because of this.\"</p> <p>Responding to a tweet, India's ambassador in Washington, Nirupama Rao, said on Twitter on Monday evening: \"u can't expect me to lead charge on gun control as a foreigner here. Although, it has to come from American citizens, and them alone.\"</p>"
