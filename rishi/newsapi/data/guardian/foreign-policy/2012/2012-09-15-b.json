  "<p>A row has broken out between animal rights activists and shooting groups over calls for gun magazines to be displayed on newsagents' top shelves.</p> <p>Animal Aid claims a poll it has commissioned suggests that most people want gun magazines showing animals being killed for sport to be treated in a similar way to pornography. Even more want the sale of such publications restricted to people over the age of 18.</p> <p>The NOP poll found that 84% of people favoured a ban on the sale of gun magazines to children, while 74% wanted them banished to the top shelf. Animal Aid claimed the results were a vindication of its campaign, during which it wrote to WH Smith asking it to ban the sale of gun magazine to under-18s. \"Shooting lobbyists have characterised us as 'crazy' and 'extremists',\" said director Andrew Tyler.</p> <p>An Animal Aid report, Gunning For Children: How the Gun Lobby Recruits Young Blood, has warned that children have easy access to publications that \"encourage the killing of animals for 'sport'.\" It highlighted a recent edition of one shooting magazine that carried a two-page article on a hunter who \"fulfilled his dream\" when he went to South Africa and shot a lion.</p> <p>The UK's largest shooting organisation, the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, said the idea of targeting shooting magazines was misplaced. \"According to the police and successive governments it is in the interests of public safety for children who will shoot to learn the safe handling of firearms,\" said Christopher Graffius, director of communications. \"Shooting magazines educate as well as entertain and not only on firearms; their content covers history, gundogs and conservation. To compare them to pornography is laughable.\"</p> <p>The Professional Publishers Association said the magazines \"are specialist interest titles published responsibly for a targeted audience\".</p>"
