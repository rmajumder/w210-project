  "Four men appeared in court yesterday charged with the attempted murder of Charlene Daly, 11, who was shot during the feud between rival loyalist gangs in Northern Ireland. <p>Charlene was hit in the back when her family home on the loyalist Ballysally estate in Coleraine, Co Londonderry, was raked by machine gun fire on August 28. </p> <p>The attack took place as a feud between rival paramilitary groups, the Ulster Defence Association and the Ulster Volunteer Force, spread from Belfast to other parts of the province. </p> <p>The four accused are John Hazlett, 29, of Limavady, Samuel Bolton, 27, from Coleraine, Thomas Dunbar, 36, from Coleraine and Philip McKergan 23, from Coleraine. They were remanded in custody after appearing at a special sitting of Ballymena magistrates court and will appear again later this month. </p> <p>Doctors said Charlene was lucky to be alive after suffering a punctured lung and several broken ribs when she was hit by a bullet as 19 shots were fired at her home. The bullet lodged in soft tissue around her left shoulder blade and remains there but Charlene was discharged from Coleraine hospital last night. A hospital spokeswoman said doctors would continue to monitor her condition but only operate if it became necessary. </p>"
