  "\"Lennon attacked with wooden stick outside apartment house,\" reads the headline in the Chicago Times, \"Expected to make full recovery.\" The story goes on to announce how a recovering Lennon has spoken about the reforming of the Beatles. The date on the paper is December 1980. <p>Another headline from the same newspaper 17 years earlier reads: \"Kennedy struck by rock in failed assassination attempt.\" The sub-head reads: \"A conspiracy of multiple hurlers is not ruled out.\" The date is November 1963 and the front page goes on to explain how Kennedy is preparing to withdraw US troops from Vietnam. A third front page is dated April 1968. \"Martin Luther King is hit by bottle in Memphis.\" The sub-head suggests that, while recovering, King has announced his plans to run for president in 1972. </p> <p>The three mock front pages have been causing people to stop and read further in Los Angeles over the last week or two. Imagine indeed. What would a live John Lennon have been up to these days? Would he still be performing? Would he have been singing for Ralph Nader in his election bid or would he have been taking part in Al Gore fund raisers? Would he be telling people not to bother voting? Would he even still be living in the United States? </p> <p>And John F Kennedy? Would he have been laid low by the likes of Kenneth Starr, his private life exposed by a less deferential press? Would he really have ended the war in Vietnam? Would he now be the elder statesman, sharing jokes with Bill Clinton, or would he be advertising cures for bad backs? </p> <p>And Martin Luther King - would he really have been the first black president of the United States? Would he have managed to change the course of history? At least we would have experienced a presidential campaign where one of the candidates knew how to make a decent speech. </p> <p>The link between the three stories, of course, is that all three had their lives cut short by guns. The posters are the work of a gun reform group who would like to see the issue of gun control debated more in the current elections. </p> <p>It is clear who the gun lovers would like to see in the White House. The National Rifle Association (NRA) has even congratulated itself on the fact that if George W Bush gets elected, the NRA will have its own office in the White House. </p> <p>Al Gore has made it clear that he does not want to curtail the rights of hunters, of people who want guns in their own homes for protection or of sportsmen. His proposals for change are modest. But now that the three presidential debates are over, it is clear that once again the whole issue of guns is one that is not going to be seriously argued. </p> <p>Guns are used in 61% of the 31,000 annual homicides in the US and in 68% of the 33,000 suicides. Gun ownership in the US has gone up by 50% in the last three decades. </p> <p>But just as neither Mr Gore nor Mr Bush were prepared to disagree over the death penalty in Tuesday night's debate, so the whole subject of firearms has not really been allowed onto the agenda. </p> <p>Last week, real headlines reported the news that a 12-year-old girl had been killed by a drive-by shooting. It looks as though it will be a long time before we are reading about children hurt slightly on the arm by a stone thrown from a car.</p>"
