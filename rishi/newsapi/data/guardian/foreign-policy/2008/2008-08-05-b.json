  "<p>Last week, the government released a <a href=\" www.justice.gov.uk/docs/murder-manslaughter-infanticide-consultation.pdf\">consultation paper (pdf)</a>, Murder, manslaughter and infanticide: proposals for reform of the law. It was designed to take steps towards bringing murder law in England and Wales into the 21st century. Now that the dust has settled slightly on the \"gender-based\" <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/new-murder-laws-may-send-wrong-message-880321.html\">provocation proposals</a>, it is good to debate the rest of the changes proposed and also to revisit those key changes more reflectively.</p> <p> It has been clear for some time that reform was needed \u2013 there has been no change to homicide law in 50 years. In 2003, the Law Commission, which had been asked to review the partial defences that cut a potential murder conviction back to manslaughter, concluded that though it could produce such a report, the better course was to let it undertake a thorough review of murder laws. The government acceded and the resulting consultation and report produced wide-ranging proposals, including to the whole structure of homicide law. The review was always a double-decker, with the commission going first and the government consulting afterwards. That second step has produced a real measure of consensus around the plans set out in this consultation but much less on the rest of the Law Commission's scheme. That is why we will try to make progress where there is agreement and review the rest when these changes have bedded down.</p> <p>The high points of the changes are in three major proposals to change the laws about diminished responsibility, complicity in homicide and, of course, provocation. </p> <p>The definition of diminished responsibility, set out in the <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1957/cukpga_19570011_en_1\">Homicide Act 1957</a>, was, like provocation, a defence introduced, or more accurately, beefed up, primarily as a mitigation to the rigours of the death penalty. It is a partial defence which allows a conviction for manslaughter only, where a defendant's responsibility for killing is diminished by what is currently called \"an abnormality of mind\". The defence has not changed significantly since its inception. So it is still grounded in 1957 psychiatry and does not square with modern medical thinking.</p> <p>To their immense credit, the commission worked very closely with forensic psychiatrists to ensure that the defence would come into better alignment with contemporary psychiatric understanding of mental functioning. The proposed new definition will be effective where the diminution of responsibility is caused by a \"recognised medical condition\". That issue will be determined by medical evidence where relevant. The related question of whether an impairment of responsibility is \"substantial' enough to reduce culpability from murder to manslaughter will be for the jury to determine, looking at all the facts surrounding the killing and examining whether the medical condition played a determining role. The current law is not clear about this division and, while in some cases psychiatrists comment on the \"substantialness\" of the impairment, sometimes they refuse to do so. </p> <p>We also propose to streamline the law of complicity to homicide and to set it out in statute. This should make it easier for courts to determine liability where more than one person has been involved in a killing. The current law is scattered across a number of court of appeal and House of Lords judgments. It is complicated and suffers from overlapping provisions and some duplication. These provisions cover gang crime and so are extremely important. The law should be clear, sending out an unmistakable message about the consequences for every member of a criminal gang if any member of it commits homicide.</p> <p>In 2005, almost half of all those convicted of murder were acting in company. When it is foreseeable \u2013 perhaps because that person is carrying a weapon \u2013 that one gang member may kill or cause really serious harm in the course of a criminal outing of any kind, then all the participants will be guilty of murder. At present, if such a killing is well beyond the scope of the criminal enterprise, the other gang members will be acquitted. If these measures come into force, they will all be convicted of at least manslaughter. That is because criminal enterprises frequently turn violent and their participation and encouragement of that risk means that they must take responsibility. This represents a significant broadening of criminal responsibility with which most of the Law Commission's consultees totally agreed. It is important that the law backs up police action and other cross-government moves that have been made in order to take on gang violence and, in particular, gun and knife crime. It is equally important that the law apportions blame among defendants appropriately and justly. </p> <p>The decision to abolish and replace the partial defence of provocation, has caused intense debate in the media. Yet it is clear that the law is out of date and wrong. It is both too lenient on those who kill out of anger and too harsh on those who kill out of fear of violence.</p> <p>The gender issue in the proposals centres on domestic violence killings. Men who kill out of anger can plead that they were provoked to lose their self-control by something done or said by the victim. In the past that has plea has been used to blame women for their own deaths because they had affairs, demeaned his sexual prowess or threatened to leave home. Women who kill, as about 20 women a year do, out of fear of violence, cannot easily fit into the same defence. Typically, they strike out with a knife in fear as their partners approach to inflict another beating.</p> <p>Thus they go too far for self-defence, which only permits a response proportionate to the violence aimed at them. Yet they are not easily seen as acting because they have been provoked to a loss of self-control. That is a model that fits anger and is not so easily applicable to fear. The court of appeal has done its best, out of a sense that this was a justice gap, to stretch provocation until it fits the fear model. This has helped a number of female defendants. However, it continues to be an uneasy fit. So the risk remains that while men who kill in anger are convicted of manslaughter, women, who respond in fear, to domestic violence can be convicted of murder. Therefore it has been proposed that the defence of provocation be abolished. In the 21st century neither men nor women should be even partially excused if they lose control and kill in anger. </p> <p>But it is right to retain a residual fragment of provocation where really exceptional circumstances make a jury accept that a defendant killed after losing control because of a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged. This will not be available for day to day situations but only exceptionally and where the conduct of the \"provoker\" is morally wrong in the eyes of the jury \u2013 the current law does not require that that conduct should be wrong, only provoking. The proposed clauses exclude sexual infidelity from being dealt with as an \"exceptional circumstance\" thus, rightly, ending its use as a defence to murder. Of course this, like all defences, will be available to men and women alike.</p> <p>The other provision in place of provocation will be killing because of a loss of control caused by fear of serious violence. This will fit those domestic violence sufferers. It will also save from a murder conviction a person attacked in the street who overreacts to the frightening situation and kills his attacker. </p> <p>Both the current law of provocation and the proposed new laws only work where there is a loss of self-control. As I have said, defendants have had to characterise that loss as having been caused less by fear and more by anger in order to fit the provocation defence. Now they will be able to use the defence of their fear. </p> <p>Some people are so undermined by long-term abuse that they cannot leave their partners. If such a person, told by the drunken perpetrator that they are going to be beaten senseless when he wakes, loses her self-control and kills him in fear, anticipating that serious violence, the new defence could be claimed. Equally such a person might perhaps claim that they had a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged. </p> <p>Whether either defence would succeed would depend on whether a jury believed in the loss of self-control and didn't think that this was a cold-blooded killing. If that were so, it would not materially differ from the long-held rule that people threatened with attack need not wait to be hit before striking out. They are entitled to a pre-emptive strike, to prevent themselves suffering a beating. In self-defence there need be no loss of self-control. For violence going beyond self-defence, loss of self-control will have to be shown in order to harness the new partial defence. </p> <p>All of these proposals are intended to modernise the law of homicide.</p>"
