  "<p>The alleged teenage killer of Rhys Jones tried to cover his tracks after gunning the schoolboy down, a court heard today. </p> <p>Rhys was shot dead in a pub car park last August as he made his way home from football training in Croxteth Park. He was a few hundred metres from home when he died. </p> <p>Sean Mercer, 18, who denies the 11-year-old's murder, disposed of his gun and clothing to avoid detection, it was alleged at Liverpool crown court. </p> <p>Opening the prosecution case, Neil Flewitt QC told the jury: \"Immediately after he killed Rhys Jones, Sean Mercer set about distancing himself from the tragic events at the Fir Tree public house. </p> <p>\"He moved quickly to dispose of his clothing, his pedal cycle and the gun that he had used to such devastating effect.\" </p> <p>Describing the killing, Flewitt said Rhys was fatally wounded in the neck by a hooded gunman, alleged to be Mercer, who fired three shots with a Smith and Wesson revolver across the car park from his bicycle.</p> <p>Rhys was not the intended target but was caught in the crossfire, Flewitt said, adding: \"He was the innocent victim of a long-running feud between rival gangs operating in and around the area of the Fir Tree public house\". </p> <p>He said the shooting was a product of \"fierce and frequently violent rivalry\" between young gang members from Croxteth's Crocky Crew and nearby Norris Green's Strand Gang, also known as Nogga Dogs.</p> <p>The prosecutor also alleged that Mercer, who lives in the Croxteth area, was helped to avoid justice by six others - James Yates, 20, Melvin Coy, 25, and Gary Kays, 25, as well as two 17-year-old boys and a 16-year old boy, who are too young to be named.</p> <p>All six deny assisting an offender.</p>"
