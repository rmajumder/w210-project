  "<p>The police officers who shot <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/menezes\">Jean Charles de Menezes</a> appeared panicky and \"out of control\", a woman who was sitting near the innocent Brazilian on the tube train where he died said today.</p> <p>Anna Dunwoodie, who was two or three seats to the left of the 27-year-old when he boarded the train at Stockwell underground station in south London, told the inquest that she was certain the officers did not shout any warning before they opened fire.</p> <p>\"I would like to say that on whether I heard anything from police officers, I am very, very clear,\" Dunwoodie said. \"I had absolutely no idea who they were and had they shouted I would have latched on to that.\"</p> <p>Her insistence that there was no shouted warning - which contradicts the version of events given earlier in the inquest by the police involved \u2013 was subsequently backed up by two other passengers on the train.</p> <p>De Menezes did not react suddenly and appeared \"almost calm\", with his eyes closed, when a gun was pointed at him, Dunwoodie said.</p> <p>The Brazilian was shot seven times in the head on the morning of July 22 2005 by armed officers who mistakenly believed he was Hussein Osman, one of a group of would-be suicide bombers whose attacks on London's transport network had failed the previous day.</p> <p>The officers who apprehended De Menezes told the inquest earlier that they shouted \"armed police\" before shooting. One firearms officer said the Brazilian moved towards him with apparent aggressive intent, making him fear that the electrician was about to detonate a bomb.</p> <p>Dunwoodie disputed this. She said the police appeared to be panicking and were \"shouting amongst themselves\".</p> <p>\"I think it was the man, who I now know to be a surveillance officer, [who] really seemed to be frightened or hyped up and when he was calling the other men they seemed ... you know, when people are full of adrenalin and they move quickly and their movements are a bit jerky,\" she told the inquest at Oval cricket ground, south London.</p> <p>\"I felt they were a bit out of control, that's what it felt like.\"</p> <p>De Menezes showed little reaction when the police boarded the train, Dunwoodie said. \"It was sort of a scrum. I remember the man holding the gun out. His [De Menezes's] eyes were closed and he looked almost calm, although I hesitate to say that.</p> <p>\"I guess he had a gun pressed to his head and there was not anything he could do about it. The first shots came very suddenly and my first thoughts were that it was someone firing a stun gun. There was a break and it was my memory that there were more shots.\"</p> <p>Two other witnesses who were sitting near carriage doors said they had no recollection of any warnings from the police. Robert Preston said he only heard police shouting \"get down, get down\". </p> <p>\"It was quite a general statement and it could have applied to me,\" he said.</p> <p>Mark Whitby, a fellow passenger, added: \"'Get down, get down.' That's all I heard. There was not one mention of armed police.\"<br></p>"
