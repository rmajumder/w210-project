  "<p>A businessman was killed and his wife critically wounded when a gunman opened fire at their isolated home in Cornwall on Saturday night, police said yesterday.</p> <p>Officers were called to the house in Porth Kea, near Truro, just before 10pm. They arrived to find Adam Hustler, 41, and his 40-year-old wife, Amanda, badly injured. Both appeared to have been shot at close range. The couple were taken to the Royal Cornwall hospital at Treliske, Truro, where Adam Hustler died.</p> <p>Amanda Hustler, who is thought to have been shot in the back, was later transferred to Derriford hospital in Plymouth, Devon, where she was said to be in a critical condition. </p> <p>At 5am on Sunday, dozens of officers - including armed police and negotiators - went to a house just outside Penzance where they arrested a 23-year-old man, believed to be the former boyfriend of one of the Hustlers' daughters, Danielle. The man, who had suffered facial injuries unconnected with his arrest, gave himself up \"without incident\". </p> <p>A gun, understood to be a .22 calibre weapon, recovered from his home is being examined by firearms experts.</p> <p>The arrested man was also taken to the Royal Cornwall hospital, where doctors were yesterday trying to assess whether he was fit to be questioned.</p> <p>Danielle Hustler and her sister were believed to be at their mother's bedside yesterday afternoon and will be interviewed by detectives later. Danielle is thought to have been at home when her parents were shot and she raised the alarm. </p> <p>A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall police said a major crime investigation team had been set up, involving around 30 officers, and the inquiry was waiting for the results of a full forensic search. A fingertip search of the murder scene was likely to take a day or two, he added.</p> <p>Hustler was the managing director of a drain-clearing business in Truro, Clear-Flow Ltd. Other members of the family were also directors of the company.</p> <p>Neighbours said yesterday that the Hustlers were a quiet and religious family who did not get involved in village activities. They are Jehovah's Witnesses.</p> <p>One neighbour said: \"I don't really know them other than to say hello to. They have been in the house for a few years, but nobody sees that much of them. It is a large house on a quiet lane leading down to a couple of farms.</p> <p>\"I only realised something was wrong when I tried to walk down there with my dogs and was turned back by the police.\"</p> <p>Another neighbour, Marie Laity, said: \"The family keep themselves to themselves and are strict Jehovah's Witnesses. It is scary to have something this shocking happen so close. It seems to have been caused by something which was personal to them, but it is still frightening.\"</p> <p>Tomas Hill, county councillor for Feock and Kea, learned of the shooting after church yesterday morning. \"Everyone is in shock,\" he said. \"It's completely unprecedented in my lifetime.\"</p> <p>Porth Kea is a hamlet of around 20 houses close to the banks of the River Fal, in an area of outstanding natural beauty. The road through the village was sealed off by police yesterday as inquiries continued.</p> <p>A tribute released through the police yesterday by Tim Mears, a representative from the Jehovah's Witnesses, described Hustler as a loving husband and father. \"The family have asked me to say that they are very shocked by these terrible and very unexpected events. Friends and family are providing loving support. </p> <p>\"Our thoughts and prayers are with Amanda, and her two daughters at this most difficult time,\" said Mears. \"Adam Hustler was a generous and caring person who thought the world of his wife and daughters. He is a great loss to all who knew him, and especially those that shared his Christian values.\"</p>"
