  "<p>A British soldier who shot dead a colleague while playing with a gun he thought was unloaded was convicted of manslaughter today.</p> <p>Twenty-year-old Aarron Kendrick shot fellow rifleman Edward Vakabua in the head while inside barracks at Saddam Hussein's former palace in Basra last year. He had aimed a sniper rifle \"in jest\" at Vakabua as he lay asleep without realising the weapon was loaded, a court martial heard. </p> <p>Vakabua, a 23-year-old Fijian in the same platoon, received immediate treatment but was pronounced dead soon afterwards. </p> <p>Kendrick, of the Wiltshire-based 4th Battalion The Rifles, admitted negligently discharging an L96 sniper rifle but denied manslaughter. </p> <p>A board of five Army officers, the military equivalent of a jury, today took two hours to find him guilty. </p> <p>Kendrick told his court martial at Bulford military court in Wiltshire that he was messing around with a sniper rifle he had not been trained to use. He then cocked the weapon and pulled the trigger, shooting Vakabua, who was lying on a bunk bed.</p> <p>Recalling the incident, Kendrick said in evidence today: \"I squeezed the trigger and there was a bang. I thought 'What the fuck?' I dropped the weapon. I remember running up to Rifleman Vakabua and that's as far as I remember.\"</p> <p>Kendrick was then removed from the room. He said at first he was in shock but he realised what he had done. \"I was heartbroken. I knew him (Rifleman Vakabua) as a good friend,\" he told the court. \"I made a mistake. I caused the death of a very good friend of mine and there is nothing I can do to change it.\"</p> <p>Colonel Nigel Jones, prosecuting, had told the hearing Kendrick had showed \"wanton disregard for normal safety precautions\".</p> <p>While weapons were not meant to be left loaded inside barracks, the court martial was told that the two snipers regularly left 10-round magazines in their rifle so they were prepared for emergencies. </p> <p>A month before his death Vakabua had saved the life of another soldier injured by mortar fire, volunteering to drive him to a helicopter evacuation site despite the continued attack. </p> <p>Kendrick will be sentenced next week.</p>"
