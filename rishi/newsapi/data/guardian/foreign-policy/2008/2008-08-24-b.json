  "<p>\"Hey Joe,\" Jimi Hendrix <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_Joe\">bellowed in 1966</a>, instantly blighting the lives of people called Joseph for decades to come: \"Where you goin' with that gun in your hand?!\" </p> <p>Had Joe been a 27-year-old megalomaniacal rock star instead of a jealous fictional lunatic, he'd probably have replied, \"I'm off to extinguish my life before I hit 28, just like you and scores of other drug-addled musicians. Now stop distracting me with stupid questions while I'm trying to immortalise myself!\"</p> <p>At least, that's the kind of macabre age-specific myth currently being lauded by Camden's <a href=\"http://www.proud.co.uk/forever-27-c-114.html\">Proud Gallery</a> which last week launched a photographic exhibition glorifying five rock icons (out of a total of 30) who kicked the bucket <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27_club\">aged 27</a>, mostly from drug overdoses. \"Forever 27\" features artily-grouped pictures of Hendrix, Brian Jones, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison (who all died between 1969 and 1971) showcased alongside prints of Kurt Cobain, who reportedly idolised the \"27 Club\" and messily torpedoed his head in order to join them.</p> <p>When I visited the exhibition, I hoped it'd be full of subheadings like \"What an idiot \u2013 you had everything, and you threw it away!\" and \"Why the hell did you blow your brains out? You had a one-year-old daughter!\" Instead, it boasted a poster advertising \"rock 'n' roll's most infamous members' club\", lamenting that the Famous Five were \"ill-fated stars whose lives have been tragically cut short at the age of 27\", as though they were all killed when a freak piece of errant scaffolding fell on their heads, instead of self-destructing by shovelling drugs into their own mouths and gulping.</p> <p>Still, if they'd been mistakenly decapitated, cruelly obliterated by a flying stapler or hit by a dustcart aged 83 after living long, enjoyable lives, they probably wouldn't be as \"iconic\", and Proud wouldn't be able to flog their photos for up to \u00a3950. Death and youth sell, especially when you tie a group of early deaths together in an apparently eerie, \"much-mythologised\" way. \"Does a nihilistic instinct kick in at the age 27?\" the subtext muses. Er, no: I just had a whole year of being 27, and I didn't want to top myself once, but then I didn't spend it wandering around wanky photographic exhibitions. \"Jim Morrison and Brian Jones both spookily died on July 3\" is the other main 27 Club observation. Yeah? Well, I was born on July 3. That's what's known as a coincidence. </p> <p>They aren't the only ones cashing in on the unnecessary 27 Club deaths though: you can also <a href=\"http://www.the27s.com/\">buy a book online</a> about \"the greatest myth of rock 'n' roll\" (interestingly, its blurb fails to mention all the rock stars who also died at 26 and 28) and for a credit-crunching \u00a322, you can buy a 27 Club t-shirt online (modelled <a href=\"http://www.a-non.co.uk/item.php?id=272\">here</a> by some kind of Jesus-Bono hybrid) emblazoned with the five dead club members and a Neil Young lyric misquoted from Cobain's suicide note: \"It's better to burn out rather [sic] than fade away.\" Hmm \u2026 is it really? Wouldn't most people rather live a long and peaceful life than choke on their own acrid carroty vomit barely a third of the way through?</p> <p>Camden is a poor area of London, and there are lots of things it needs, but an exhibition romanticising early drug-related deaths isn't one of them. What it needs far more, in among all its dealers and junkies, is a celebration of life. The space at Proud could be better used to tell the stories of ordinary people who were penniless and anonymous, but still made the very most of every moment instead of obliterating themselves. As Oasis's songwriter Noel Gallagher said of Cobain in the early 1990s: \"Seems to me that here was a guy who had everything, and was miserable about it. And we had fuck all, and I still thought that getting up in the morning was the greatest fuckin' thing ever.\" He insisted, \"I can't have people like [Cobain] coming over here, on smack, fucking saying that they hate themselves and they wanna die. That's fucking rubbish. Kids don't need to be hearing that nonsense.\"</p> <p>So he decided to write the upbeat single <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Forever\">Live Forever</a> as an antidote. It was released in 1994, when Gallagher was that most nihilistic of ages: 27.</p>"
