Several witnesses have already come forward, but there will be others who saw something or know something. We need those people to get in touch with us.\"</p> <p>A 21-year-old neighbour, who refused to give her name, said: \"We heard the gunshots and thought it was fireworks. We heard 'bang, bang, bang' and I thought, it's a bit early for fireworks. Then we heard there was a boy on the floor and he'd been shot four times. </p> <p>\"I know the boy who it was, we used to hang around together with other youngsters when we were kids though I've lost touch with him since. </p> <p>\"I saw him a few days ago, it's shocking to think that now he's dead. The time was when people used to fight with their fists, now it's all gone crazy.\"</p>"
