  "<p>A British soldier who shot dead a colleague in Iraq while playing with a loaded sniper rifle was today jailed for two years. </p> <p>Aarron Kendrick, 20, shot Edward Vakabua, a 23-year-old Fijian, in the head with the rifle in a bunk room at Basra Palace on July 6 last year.<br> Kendrick, of 4th Battalion the Rifles, was not trained to handle the weapon, which belonged to a sniper who had left the room. </p> <p>As a joke he cocked it, aimed it at Vakabua and pulled the trigger. The bullet struck the soldier as he lay on his bed. Colleagues tried to save him but he died within minutes. </p> <p>Kendrick, based at Warminster, in Wiltshire, admitted to negligently discharging an L96 sniper rifle but denied manslaughter. A board of five army officers found him guilty at a court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire, last week. </p> <p>Sentencing him today, judge advocate Jack Bayliss ordered the soldier to serve 16 months of the sentence at a military detention centre at Colchester known as the Glass House.</p> <p>The judge said the board had decided not to dismiss Kendrick from the army and it would be the decision of his commanding officer whether to take him back after the completion of his sentence. </p> <p>\"Your most culpable act was to point the weapon at another soldier lying in his bunk and pulling the trigger. You were taught that you never point a weapon at anyone in jest or in the course of mucking about,\" Bayliss said. </p> <p>\"We are left with no option but to conclude that only a significant custodial sentence can be justified. It was dangerous and reckless and an act which has cost another young man his life, devastated two families and lost the army a good young soldier.\"</p> <p>The court martial heard that the shooting happened while Kendrick's unit was preparing for an operation at Basra Palace, which had been turned into the battalion's headquarters. The soldier had been allowed to mess about with the rifle by a sniper colleague.</p> <p>Colonel Nigel Jones, prosecuting, said Kendrick \"in jest\" pointed the gun at Vakabua, which he called \"the cardinal sin of weapon handling\".</p> <p>Recalling the incident, Kendrick said in evidence: \"I squeezed the trigger and there was a bang. I thought 'What the fuck?' I dropped the weapon. I remember running up to Rifleman Vakabua and that's as far as I remember.\" </p> <p>Kendrick had served nearly three years in the army prior to the shooting and had been awarded the Iraq medal for his service in the country. </p> <p>Today, the court was read a statement by the commanding officer of 4th Battalion the Rifles, Colonel Patrick Sanders, who said the soldier had shown \"deep remorse, guilt and shame\" over what had happened. </p> <p>\"His reaction at the scene and his subsequent behaviour and demeanour suggested to me that he was and remained appalled at being responsible for the death of a fellow rifleman and friend,\" the statement said.</p> <p>\"At no stage did he try to deflect blame and he assumed full responsibility for his actions and the consequences of it. I believe he will carry the burden of responsibility for the rest of his life.\"</p> <p>In a statement through his solicitor, Kendrick said today: \"I have always accepted that I was responsible for the appalling consequences and I have to live with the memories of that incident and the aftermath. I am ashamed that my handling of the weapon resulted in Edward's death and I will carry that responsibility for the rest of my life.\"</p>"
