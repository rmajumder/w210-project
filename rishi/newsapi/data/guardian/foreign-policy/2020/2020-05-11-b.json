  "<p>Police investigating last month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nova-scotia-shooting\">mass shooting in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia</a> have launched a psychological analysis of the deceased gunman, in the hope of better understanding what led him to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/nova-scotia-shooting-canada-new-details\">kill 22 people</a> over a 12-hour period.</p> <p>The Royal Canadian Mounted police said on Monday that they were carrying out a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/news/2020/update-investigation-the-incidents-april-18-and-19-0\">psychological autopsy</a>\u201d on Gabriel Wortman, who carried out the worst shooting in the country\u2019s history. </p> <p>\u201cThe RCMP\u2019s Behavioural Analysis Unit is conducting a psychological autopsy of the gunman, with the intent of gathering insights into why he committed the acts of violence. This includes an analysis of his personality, past behaviour and how he related to others,\u201d said the statement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/nova-scotia-shooting-canada-new-details\">Twelve hours of terror: how the Nova Scotia shooting rampage unfolded</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The technique, which involves extensive in-depth interviews with friends, family and colleagues, has been used for nearly 70 years, often to determine motives behind suicides. But the practice can also provide clarity in cases of mass murder.</p> <p>\u201cThese are much more than police inquiries,\u201d clinical and forensic psychologist Antoon Leenaars told the Canadian Press. \u201cThey are investigations of the mind.\u201d</p> <p>Leenaars, who wrote the 2017 book, The Psychological Autopsy, said the aim of the investigation is to construct a robust and detailed portrait of an individual, with the hope of providing clues as to why they acted in a particular way.</p> <p>\u201cGiven what this was designed for, I think this would be a perfect situation \u2026 That evidence can be extremely helpful in terms of trying to understand what happened,\u201d said Leenaars.</p> <p>The psychological autopsy is part of a sweeping police investigation, which includes analysis of 17 separate crime scenes. The RCMP said they used \u201cground penetrating radar\u201d to scan the gunman\u2019s property to determine if anything of importance was buried, but found nothing.</p> <p>Police also announced an update on the firearms \u2013 two semiautomatic handguns and two semiautomatic rifles \u2013 used by the gunman.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the guns has been traced to Canada. The remaining guns that were recovered are believed to have been obtained in the United States,\u201d they said.</p> <p>After the shooting, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/canada-assault-weapons-ban-trudeau-nova-scotia-shooting\">announced</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/canada-assault-weapons-ban-trudeau-nova-scotia-shooting\"> a ban </a>on 1,500 models of \u201cmilitary grade assault weapons\u201d last week \u2013 a move that has come under fire in recent days for loopholes that would allow gun owners to continue possessing the firearms.</p> <p>For much of his deadly spree, the gunman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/nova-scotia-shooting-gabriel-wortman-replica-police-cruiser-girlfriend\">disguised himself as an RCMP officer</a>, using parts of an authentic uniform and a replica police vehicle to evade capture and to lure victims.</p> <p>Police said on Monday that the decals used on the shooter\u2019s vehicle were created by an individual at a decal company without permission from the owner. Both the individual who made the decal, and the owner, are cooperating with police.</p> <p>Police said on Monday they had spoken to 500 witnesses and are continuing to conduct interviews, asking anyone who had a \u201cprofessional or personal\u201d conflict with the gunman to come forward.</p>"
