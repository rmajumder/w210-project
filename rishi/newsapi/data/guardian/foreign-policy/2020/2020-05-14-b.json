  "<p>It has been two months since Breonna Taylor was sleeping in her apartment on the south side of Louisville, Kentucky, when plainclothes police officers arrived outside her door in the early hours of 13 March.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/ahmaud-arbery-georgia-prosecutors-under-investigation\">Ahmaud Arbery: prosecutors under investigation over handling of killing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Across the country, many people were starting to work from home as the grip of coronavirus quickly spread.<strong> </strong>But Taylor, a 26-year-old certified EMT, was an essential worker, still going to help at two Louisville hospitals as the city braced for the worst.</p> <p>\u201cShe had no regard for her health when it came to helping others,\u201d said lawyer Ben Crump in a virtual press conference on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the tragedy is it wasn\u2019t coronavirus that killed Breonna Taylor. It was police officers that were being reckless and irresponsible and shooting from outside the house, shooting through windows. They don\u2019t do this in other neighborhoods.\u201d</p> <p>With officials and the media largely distracted by the coronavirus pandemic, the police killing of Taylor, who is African American, largely escaped widespread scrutiny. Taylor\u2019s family and friends called for justice, rallying outside downtown Louisville\u2019s court complex in March, but they gained little momentum.</p> <p>That changed after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">the release of a video showing the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery</a> \u2013 a black jogger who was confronted and gunned down by a white father and son. More attention is being paid to Taylor\u2019s death as eyes are once again drawn to the epidemic of young black Americans being gunned down by cops and fellow civilians alike.</p> <p>Crump, who also represents the Arbery family, has previously been involved in other high-profile cases of African American shooting victims including Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Tamir Rice.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the California senator and former presidential candidate Kamala Harris <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1260629289529233408\">called for the Department of Justice to investigate Taylor\u2019s killing.</a></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It wasn\u2019t coronavirus that killed Breonna Taylor. It was police officers that were being reckless and irresponsible</p> <footer> <cite>Ben Crump</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kentucky\u2019s governor, Andy Beshear, called reports about Taylor\u2019s death \u201ctroubling\u201d and called for a review into the results of the police investigation \u201cto ensure justice is done at a time when many are concerned that justice is not blind\u201d.</p> <p>On the night that Taylor was killed, the officers were serving a no-knock search warrant in a narcotics investigation. Police have since said the officers knocked and announced themselves before entering.</p> <p>Lawyers for Taylor\u2019s family and her boyfriend Kenneth Walker, who was with Taylor that night, say they did not. Walker said he thought he was witnessing a home invasion, prompting him to pick up his gun and fire a shot that hit an officer in the leg after a battering ram plowed through the apartment\u2019s door.</p> <p>Police responded by firing more than 20 times. Taylor was hit by eight rounds. According to an affidavit filed by Walker\u2019s defense lawyer Rob Eggert: \u201cYou could look through one of the bullet holes and see into the next-door apartment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was incredible that Ms Taylor was the only one killed,\u201d he added later in the document.</p> <p>No drugs were found. Taylor died. Walker was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of a police officer and first-degree assault. Three officers involved were reassigned pending an investigation.</p> <p>In a suit against three Louisville police officers involved in the shooting, lawyers for Taylor\u2019s family accuse the police of negligence, excessive force and wrongful death. Additionally, they said police were searching for a suspect who had already been apprehended and that police lacked probable cause. In firing their weapons \u201cblindly\u201d, lawyers wrote, police showed \u201ca total disregard for the value of human life\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBreonna had posed no threat to the officers and did nothing to deserve to die at their hands.\u201d</p> <p>An affidavit for a search warrant obtained by the Guardian on Wednesday described how police had observed a car regularly operated by two suspected drug dealers make \u201cfrequent trips\u201d from a drug-dealing \u201ctrap house\u201d near the city center to Taylor\u2019s home, more than 10 miles away.</p> <p>According to the warrant, police believed one of the suspected dealers, Jamarcus Glover, was keeping either drugs or drug money in Taylor\u2019s home.</p> <p>In applying for the warrant for Taylor\u2019s apartment, police requested permission for a no-knock entry \u201cdue to the nature of how these drug traffickers operate\u201d.</p> <p>Lawyers for Walker and Taylor say neighbors in the building can attest that police did not knock or announce themselves.</p> <p>A Louisville police spokesperson did not respond to questions from the Guardian about how officers executed the search warrant.</p> <p>The police department often releases video captured by body-worn cameras after police-involved shootings. But the officers involved in serving the warrant on Taylor\u2019s home do not wear body cams.</p> <p>\u201cIf this was another community, another household in a more affluent community, lightning would strike and thunder would groan\u201d if such a warrant were issued, Crump said.</p> <p>Walker, Crump said, believed the police \u201cwere committing a home invasion. Don\u2019t African Americans have the right to the second amendment? He was trying to protect Breonna. He was trying to protect himself.\u201d</p> <p>After a judge released Walker to home incarceration in late March, the president of the River City Fraternal Order of Police \u2013 which represents Louisville police officers \u2013 called the decision \u201ca slap in the face to everyone wearing a badge.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Louisville Corrections Fraternal Order of Police called Walker <a href=\"https://www.wave3.com/2020/03/27/judge-releases-man-who-shot-officer-during-deadly-confrontation-weeks-ago/\">\u201can attempted cop killer\u201d</a> when he was released.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, Walker\u2019s attorney Eggert said: \u201cGiven the facts of the case, they ought to dismiss the case against Kenneth Walker.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/los-angeles-coronavirus-inequality-undocumented-healthcare\">No insurance, no savings, no support: what happens when LA's least privileged get Covid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Christopher 2X, an anti-violence activist in Louisville, said Taylor\u2019s killing would be a setback to a relationship between African Americans and police in Louisville.</p> <p>\u201cThat one shooting \u2013 and then when it doesn\u2019t get the proper response from those in city government \u2013 can be the thing that knocks the dominoes down,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In Kentucky, Taylor\u2019s death has spurred calls for a thorough investigation from Louisville\u2019s mayor, as well as the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and the Democrats vying to face him in November\u2019s election.</p> <p>On Tuesday, a Democratic Senate candidate, Mike Broihier, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeForKY/status/1260372287578144774\">tweeted</a>: \u201cIf you\u2019re African-American in this country, you can be killed by police, or ex-police, or wannabe-police, and people will say you were \u2018no angel.\u2019 As an EMT, Breonna Taylor saved lives. Who, if not her, is an angel?\u201d</p>"
