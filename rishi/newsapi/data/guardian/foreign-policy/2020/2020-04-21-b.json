  "<p>Police in Canada have updated the death toll of the country\u2019s worst mass shooting to 22, as more victims from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/nova-scotia-shooting-friends-family-pay-tribute-victims\">gun rampage in Nova Scotia</a> were publicly identified.</p> <p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) had previously warned the death toll would increase as investigators combed through several homes intentionally set ablaze by the gunman in a 12-hour rampage that started late on Saturday in the town of Portapique. On Tuesday, 16 separate crime scenes were being examined across the province.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/canada_shooting_map/giv-39026zLjkJSGsU0C/\" data-alt=\"map of attacks\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/canada_shooting_map/giv-39026zLjkJSGsU0C/\">map of attacks</a> </figure>  <p>The total number of deaths from the attack reached 23, including the gunman.

When he didn\u2019t return hours later, family fanned out to search for him \u2013 only to realize that he had last been seen close to the shooting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0fa4a1f455efa45c164a51a77edc9345102d583\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0fa4a1f455efa45c164a51a77edc9345102d583/0_0_810_540/500.jpg\" alt=\"Joey Webber was a keen outdoorsman.\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joey Webber was a keen outdoorsman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Just Giving</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Webber, a keen outdoorsman who was known for harvesting timber by horse, leaves behind his partner, Shanda MacLeod, and their two daughters, according to a crowdfunding page set up to help the family.</p> <p>The remains of Elizabeth Joanne Thomas and her husband, John Zahl, are believed to be still inside the burned-out two-storey log cabin, their grandson Justin Zahl told the Associated Press. Their home was next to that of the gunman, Gabriel Wortman, 51, and is thought to have been among the first properties to be attacked.</p> <p>Authorities have not identified a motive for the killings but said there was clear premeditation: Wortman wore a fake police uniform and decorated his car to look like an RCMP cruiser.</p> <p>As the attacks unfolded, police warned residents of the rural community to lock their doors and stay in their basements.</p> <p>Many people were already at home because of the coronavirus lockdown, but Lillian Hyslop had ventured out for a walk when she was shot dead.
