  "<p>Caheri Gutierrez and her friend were waiting at a red light in downtown Oakland when another car pulled up alongside them.</p> <p>It was 20 November 2008, and Gutierrez, then 18, was on her way to help her mother clean an office building that night.</p> <p>Looking straight ahead she didn\u2019t see the window of the other car roll down, nor the gun pointed at them.<strong> </strong>She just remembers a bullet busting through the window, feeling a jolt of electricity, and then seeing blood coming from her friend\u2019s arm.</p> <p>\u201cOh my goodness, they shot you!\u201d Gutierrez screamed.</p> <p>Her friend stared at her<strong> </strong>\u201clike a ghost\u201d and abruptly turned away. Gutierrez touched the lower half of her face, felt chunks of mushy, bloody flesh on the inside of her cheek and slowly realized she was the one who had been shot.</p> <p>Her hands became stiff as she lost consciousness. \u201cI\u2019m about to die,\u201d she thought before blacking out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Guns%20and%20lies&amp;description=Gun%20homicides%20nationwide%20have%20barely%20declined%2C%20but%20in%20California\u2019s%20Bay%20Area%20they\u2019re%20down%2030%25.%20In%20a%20year-long%20series%2C%20the%20Guardian%20investigates%20the%20initiatives%20that%20are%20saving%20lives%20in%20an%20area%20scarred%20by%20rising%20inequality%20and%20gentrification&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2F&amp;links=true&amp;link-1-headline=Traumatized%20migrant%20kids%20were%20being%20shot.%20One%20school%20district%20came%20up%20with%20a%20plan%20to%20save%20them&amp;link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fapr%2F27%2Foakland-migrant-kids-murder-schools&amp;link-2-headline=92%25%20black%20or%20Latino%3A%20the%20California%20laws%20that%20keep%20minorities%20in%20prison&amp;link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2019%2Fnov%2F26%2Fcalifornia-gang-enhancements-laws-black-latinos&amp;link-3-headline=Gun%20violence%20has%20sharply%20declined%20in%20California\u2019s%20Bay%20Area.%20What%20happened%3F&amp;link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fng-interactive%2F2019%2Fjun%2F03%2Fgun-violence-bay-area-drop-30-percent-why-investigation\" data-alt=\"Series linker\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Guns%20and%20lies&description=Gun%20homicides%20nationwide%20have%20barely%20declined%2C%20but%20in%20California\u2019s%20Bay%20Area%20they\u2019re%20down%2030%25.%20In%20a%20year-long%20series%2C%20the%20Guardian%20investigates%20the%20initiatives%20that%20are%20saving%20lives%20in%20an%20area%20scarred%20by%20rising%20inequality%20and%20gentrification&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2F&links=true&link-1-headline=Traumatized%20migrant%20kids%20were%20being%20shot.%20One%20school%20district%20came%20up%20with%20a%20plan%20to%20save%20them&link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fapr%2F27%2Foakland-migrant-kids-murder-schools&link-2-headline=92%25%20black%20or%20Latino%3A%20the%20California%20laws%20that%20keep%20minorities%20in%20prison&link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2019%2Fnov%2F26%2Fcalifornia-gang-enhancements-laws-black-latinos&link-3-headline=Gun%20violence%20has%20sharply%20declined%20in%20California\u2019s%20Bay%20Area.%20What%20happened%3F&link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fng-interactive%2F2019%2Fjun%2F03%2Fgun-violence-bay-area-drop-30-percent-why-investigation\">Series linker</a> </figure>  <p>Gutierrez woke up five days later at Oakland\u2019s Highland hospital, her hands strapped to a bed and tubes in her mouth, nose and throat.

In Oakland, where she lives, gun homicide rates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/jun/03/gun-violence-bay-area-drop-30-percent-why-investigation\">fell</a> by more than 40% in the past decade, from 93 in 2007 to 58 in 2017. But for every person who is shot and killed, experts estimate at least two to four shooting victims survive their injuries. That means that there are many more stories of survival than fatality.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I couldn\u2019t talk. I could only write, and I would ask my mom and the hospital staff if I could see my face</p> <footer> <cite>Caheri Gutierrez</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With this in mind, a growing cohort of medical professionals and violence prevention organizers are collaborating to highlight the plights of survivors in the national gun violence conversation. They\u2019ve found that intervention in the hours and days following a shooting can jumpstart the months, and sometimes years, of mental and physical rehabilitation that lie ahead for victims, and help prevent retaliatory violence in their communities.</p> <p>The Bay Area has been at the forefront of this battle. The violence prevention not-for-profit Youth Alive! brought a hospital-based violence intervention program to Highland hospital in the 1990s. Several other programs have emerged in the region since then, and they have been credited with contributing to the decrease in gun violence in the Bay Area over the past 10 years.</p> <p>\u201cWhen people are in the hospital and in crisis they need guidance through that moment,\u201d says Kyndra Simmons, the Youth Alive! intervention director. \u201cSome people just want to feel safe again. And we have violence interrupters that can help them plan that out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-3-zip/giv-3902aPCH2cfhxuqb/index.html\" data-alt=\"Jeremy's video\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-3-zip/giv-3902aPCH2cfhxuqb/index.html\">Jeremy's video</a> </figure>  <p>In the early morning of 4 June 2016, Jeremy Posey and a friend were sitting in a car in front of Posey\u2019s mother\u2019s West Oakland home. The pair had been out clubbing after Posey broke up with his girlfriend earlier in the day, and they were recapping the night when several men walked up and tried to jack the car.</p> <p>As Posey and his friend sped<strong> </strong>off, the would-be robbers opened fire from behind. Bullets pierced the back window.<strong> </strong>Posey ducked to avoid the gunfire, but a bullet hit him in the back.</p> <p>He remained conscious but immediately started losing feeling in his legs. \u201cI\u2019m about to die in the passenger seat of my friend\u2019s car,\u201d he thought.</p> <p>Posey\u2019s friend rushed him to Highland hospital,<strong> </strong>where he stayed in the intensive care unit for two weeks. Doctors told Posey, a 26-year-old athlete and a former clown for his sister\u2019s drill team, that he had a complete T7 spinal cord injury and would probably be permanently paralyzed from the chest down.</p> <p>Once the surgery drugs and pain medicine wore off, Posey started having nightmares that lasted into his stay at the Fairmont rehabilitation and wellness center in San Leandro, right outside of Oakland.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was tough. The constant pain, the magnitude of losing my ability to walk and having to relearn stuff</p> <footer> <cite>Jeremy Posey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was tough. The constant pain, the magnitude of losing my ability to walk and having to relearn stuff,\u201d Posey recalls of his time in rehabilitation. \u201cI had to learn how to close my hand so I could write. I had to learn how to get dressed by myself, use the bathroom, shower by myself and take care of myself.\u201d</p> <p>Posey spent six months in Fairmont\u2019s acute rehabilitation and another three months in the facility\u2019s long-term nursing department. Meanwhile, a local not-for-profit that helps people with disabilities found him a wheelchair-accessible apartment where he could live on his own. Eventually he moved into an apartment in San Leandro, where he\u2019s been for the past three years.<strong> </strong>Although he was denied victim\u2019s compensation funds by the state board, he receives social security, and disability benefits from the state.</p> <p>Before the shooting<strong> </strong>that left him paralyzed, Posey envisioned \u201ca life of grandeur\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMy expectation was being able to make a lot of money playing sports or being a performer,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really into the materialistic side of what life offers.\u201d</p> <p>After his injury, his first priority was to simply regain independence. He now drives himself around in a car that has been modified with hand controls in lieu of gas and brake pedals. His social life centers around the kickbacks in friends\u2019 homes and events like Golden State Warriors championship parades. Navigating his first parade as a wheelchair user was \u201cridiculous\u201d, he recalled. At one point he found himself stuck on a walking bridge. \u201cYou trying to get out of the crowd bro?\u201d, a<strong> </strong>group of parade-goers asked<strong>,</strong> before lifting him, wheelchair and all, over a railing and out of the thick crowd.</p> <p>\u201cIt was funny for the most part because these people didn\u2019t know me from a can of paint,\u201d Posey recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to see that there are people who are willing to help other people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F5bda476bc41b8bdd12e923eb939912c21fb8fdd4%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3138_2092&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fac12657e72e020422547daef46847b09e2a20920%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3240_2160&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Jeremy Posey\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F5bda476bc41b8bdd12e923eb939912c21fb8fdd4%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3138_2092&left-caption=&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fac12657e72e020422547daef46847b09e2a20920%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3240_2160&right-caption=&always-place-captions-below=false\">Jeremy Posey</a> <figcaption>Jeremy Posey was left permanently paralyzed after being shot in his friends car.

He watches films, tries out new restaurants, and spends time with some of the other men in his apartment complex who are also in wheelchairs, some who were in the same hospital at the same time he was.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all pretty close,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll have potluck-style cookouts where we eat, drink and listen to music.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe try to stay close because when you get in a predicament like this you need a support system. Even after you\u2019re physically healed, having people that you can talk to and be around for positive vibes is definitely necessary.\u201d</p> <p>But Posey has found that physical therapies, staying social and random acts of kindness can only do so much. \u201cMental health and emotional trauma therapy are two of the biggest things we don\u2019t talk about for people who become paralyzed and experience gun violence,\u201d Posey says.</p> <p>\u201cWe mostly just deal with the physical and move on from it,\u201d he continues. \u201cBut probably the biggest thing is having more resources where people can address the emotional and mental stress that comes with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Seven years and several facial and dental surgeries after her shooting, Caheri Gutierrez has come to the same realization. She now works for Oakland Promise, the city\u2019s youth development program, and leads youth-focused gun violence prevention workshops.</p> <p>She\u2019s pursuing a degree in sociology and Chicana studies at UC Berkeley and hopes to one day open a hospital-based violence intervention program for gunshot wound survivors in Mexico.</p> <p>\u201cI realized that I don\u2019t want any young person to ever experience this,\u201d Gutierrez says. \u201cSo I learned a lot of facts and statistics, and met a network of community members who had similar relationships to gun violence as me.\u201d</p> <p>Both Gutierrez and Posey dealt with some form of gun violence before their own shootings. Posey says he\u2019s lost friends to gun violence and attended functions that ended in shootouts.</p> <p>And two years before her own injury, Gutierrez\u2019s brother\u2019s head was grazed by a bullet during a Halloween party. She says that growing up in East Oakland she\u2019d been preparing herself since age 11 for the day her brother would be shot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7400951a57c52ca451a4c3b7185739c72cd0e1dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7400951a57c52ca451a4c3b7185739c72cd0e1dd/0_0_3240_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caheri Gutierrez was 18 when she was shot. \u2018It was a lot to process, and I would spend days just looking in the mirror all day,\u2019 she said.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caheri Gutierrez was 18 when she was shot. \u2018It was a lot to process, and I would spend days just looking in the mirror all day,\u2019 she said.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brandon Tauszik/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most gunshot survivors are young black or Latino men.<strong> </strong>In 2017, firearm injuries were the<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/injury/images/lc-charts/leading_causes_of_death_by_age_group_violence_2017_1100w850h.jpg\"> third leading cause of death</a> among people ages 15-34 in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and it was the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthequity/lcod/men/2017/nonhispanic-black/index.htm\">number one cause of death</a> among black males in the same age group.</p> <p>Still, once it happened Gutierrez was in shock. \u201cThat shit rocked my world,\u201d she says of her brother\u2019s injury. \u201cI was once a high-performing academic student. I couldn\u2019t go into my classroom and pay attention to what was happening. I started cutting class and smoking weed to cope.</p> <p>Eventually, Gutierrez, who played for Golden Bear Volleyball Club, UC Berkeley\u2019s youth team, was expelled from school.</p> <p>\u201cThat was the wrong way to respond to the trauma I was displaying,\u201d Gutierrez says of school administrators\u2019 response to her behavior. \u201cThose were very normal behaviors that people experiencing gun violence and trauma begin to take on.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Rochelle Dicker, a University of San Francisco trauma surgeon, has seen countless gunshot wound victims in her almost two-decades-long career.</p> <p>When someone comes into a trauma center after being shot the \u201cair is a lot thicker with tension and anxiety\u201d than it is during other emergencies, Dicker says. Not only is there a patient with life-threatening injuries, but concerned family members are often kept out of the hospital for hours because of a police presence or lockdown protocol for shooting incidents.</p> <p>Dicker founded the Wraparound Project, UCSF\u2019s version of a hospital-based intervention program (HIVP), to help stop the revolving door of gunshot wound injuries and provide care that goes beyond stopping bleeding and stitching open wounds to survivors.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>We need to provide social care to our patients as much as we provide traditional care,\u201d she argues. \u201cOtherwise, we\u2019re just patching people up and not changing anything about their risk factors.\u201d</p> <p>The Wraparound Project and Caught in the Crossfire, the Highland hospital project started by Youth Alive! in the 1990s, are now two<a href=\"https://www.thehavi.org/directory-by-name\"> of dozens</a> of HVIPs in the US that, in the moments after a shooting, dispatch social workers to help families and patients, and send local violence interrupters to communities and hospital bedsides to stop retaliation.</p> <p>\u201cThese programs are built on the principles that violence is a public health issue,\u201d Dicker said. \u201cWe provide not only mental wellness care but ultimately link people with resources, practical things like good jobs and better education.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fd1c176c4cfbca6bba39dcf9e65b86a8fb0b9940\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd1c176c4cfbca6bba39dcf9e65b86a8fb0b9940/0_0_3240_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caheri Gutierrez now works for Oakland Promise, the city\u2019s youth development program, and leads youth-focused gun violence prevention workshops.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caheri Gutierrez now works for Oakland Promise, the city\u2019s youth development program, and leads youth-focused gun violence prevention workshops.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brandon Tauszik/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is limited publicly available or government-sponsored research on the efficacy of HVIPs, but the studies and reports that are available point to positive results. In 2012, the US Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/defendingchildhood/cev-rpt-full.pdf\">recommended</a> that more HVIPs should be developed across the country. According to a <a href=\"https://lawcenter.giffords.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Healing-Communities-in-Crisis-URL.pdf\">2016 report</a> from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, HVIPs combine effective gun violence reduction practices like focused deterrence and connecting people with employment resources.</p> <p>The report argues the programs are ultimately also cost-savers. Hospital treatment for a non-fatal gunshot wound patient typically amounts to around $24,000. The total costs of a single instance of gun violence can be up to six figures, when incarceration and families\u2019 income loss are included. Dicker\u2019s Wraparound Project is credited with saving UCSF an estimated $500,000 a year.</p> <p>Both Gutierrez and Posey received support from Youth Alive!\u2019s HVIP. As survivors, they\u2019re committed to help reduce gun violence in their communities.</p> <p>\u201cI have identified what I want to do for the rest of my life through my journey of gun violence,\u201d Gutierrez says. \u201cIt\u2019s my passion to prevent it by teaching young people that when you\u2019re mad you don\u2019t pull out a gun, there are ways to calm yourself down. Gun violence caused by anger is preventable, and I want people to remember that.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Videos by <a href=\"http://brandontauszik.com/\">Brandon Tauszik</a></em></p></li> </ul>"
