After nearly 44 years incarcerated, he would be free from a life sentence handed to him as a juvenile.</p> <p>His sister Yolanda Peterson had prepared a room for him to stay in her Harper Woods home and planned for his parole agent to come see the place.

Staff performed CPR. Garrison was transported to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Gautz said. </p> <p>A postmortem test confirmed that he was positive for Covid-19.

She said men in prison have told her that her brother\u2019s cellmate was ill several days before Garrison died.</p> <p>The Department of Corrections disputed that account. Gautz said health care staff went cell-to-cell to assess prisoners in the days before Garrison died, and Garrison\u2019s bunkmate denied having symptoms of Covid-19, aside from a cough. The man later tested negative for the coronavirus when assessed again after Garrison\u2019s death, Gautz said. </p> <p>Garrison is one of 17 state prisoners who\u2019ve died of Covid-19 as of Friday. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e9b53548f08b7689b030fcd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T19:28:59.754Z\">8.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Former treasury secretary to George W Bush dies</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77367c1d52bc4dd0b73cc358b40e146a6cab90fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77367c1d52bc4dd0b73cc358b40e146a6cab90fe/0_108_1992_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Then Treasury Secretary Paul O\u2019Neill, left, is joined by then Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and then New York City Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen, right, on the New York Stock Exchange trading floor when trading resumed for the first time since the previous week\u2019s terrorist attack.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Then Treasury Secretary Paul O\u2019Neill, left, is joined by then Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and then New York City Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen, right, on the New York Stock Exchange trading floor when trading resumed for the first time since the previous week\u2019s terrorist attack.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paul O\u2019Neill, a former Treasury secretary who broke with <strong>George W.
