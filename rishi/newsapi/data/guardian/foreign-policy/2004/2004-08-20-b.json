  "Iraqi police were today believed to have taken control of the Najaf mosque that served as the nervecentre of the radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's rebellion against the country's interim government. <p>An initial statement from the information ministry said Iraqi police had entered the Imam Ali mosque, one of the most revered sites in Shia Islam, to find that Mr Sadr and his militia fighters had left. </p> <p>Later reports suggested 400 members of the cleric's Mahdi army militia were arrested.</p> <p>If confirmed, the takeover of the mosque would suggest that Mr Sadr's two-week rebellion was either over or approaching its end, but Reuters reported there was still fighting outside the site.</p> <p>Haidar Salahuddine, a cameraman for the news agency, said gun battles were blocking his route to the mosque. \"Fighting is continuing near the Imam Ali mosque. We can't approach the shrine because of the clashes,\" he said.</p> <p>The Guardian correspondent Luke Harding, in Najaf, earlier expressed scepticism that the fighting would end with any peace deal. \"The problem is that the old city is totally under Mahdi army control, and is heavily boobytrapped,\" he said.</p> <p>At least 77 Iraqis have been killed and 70 wounded during fighting in Najaf over the past 24 hours, according to Iraq's health ministry. </p> <p>US warplanes this morning pounded the Shia rebels after Mr Sadr rejected a final order from the interim Iraqi prime minister, Ayad Allawi, for him to leave the mosque and disarm.</p> <p>The two sides later adopted conciliatory positions when Mr Sadr said he would hand the keys to representatives of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most senior Shia cleric, and Mr Allawi said he was extending the \"olive branch\" of peace with his offer to the cleric to follow a political path. </p> <p>\"He can join the political process and he is welcome to do so. We don't have any objections,\" Mr Allawi told the BBC World Service this morning.</p> <p>\"If he has any political problems with the government, with the multinational force, then he can be chosen as the leader of Iraq when the elections start in two or three months' time. Then he can do whatever he likes, with nobody trying to quash him.\"</p> <p>A senior aide to Mr Sadr said the cleric was still refusing to disarm, but any fighter who wanted to enter the mosque would have to leave his weapon outside.</p> <p>\"Handing over the keys means handing over the administration of this international landmark to the religious authority. We will be ordinary people visiting it,\" Sheikh Ali al-Sheibani told reporters.</p> <p>The standoff in Najaf has plunged Iraq's interim government into its worst crisis so far. Over the past two weeks, the situation in the city has oscillated between war and truce with various peace moves being proposed, but collapsing.</p> <p>Mr Sadr yesterday reverted to his trademark defiance, a day after he had apparently agreed to a demand from Iraq's national conference to give up fighting and enter mainstream politics. </p> <p>On Tuesday, he had refused to see a delegation from the conference that had travelled to the shrine to meet him.</p>"
