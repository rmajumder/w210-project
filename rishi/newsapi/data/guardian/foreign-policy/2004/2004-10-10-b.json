  "A girl of 14 died on the operating table early yesterday after being hit by shots from a passing car yards from her home. <p>The mother of Danielle Beccan heard gunfire and ran from the house to find her daughter slumped on the ground. </p> <p>Danielle was returning from the annual Goose Fair in Nottingham with a group of friends just after midnight when she was hit by up to six bullets. </p> <p>It was not clear last night whether the shooting had been random or whether the gunmen had been targeting others in the group. Nottingham has been plagued by a spate of gun crime in recent years. </p> <p>A teenage friend of the victim told The Observer: 'One of her friends saw a gun pointing out and shouted for everyone to get down, but she was too slow. She was dropping to the floor when she was hit in the chest and stomach.' </p> <p>A 17-year-old, who did not want to be named, said she was in a nearby street when she heard the gunfire and ran to see what had happened. </p> <p>'I saw the car, a gold Citro\u00ebn with blacked-out windows,' she said. 'I reckoned it was a case of mistaken identity because they were with a group of boys.' </p> <p>Nottinghamshire's assistant chief constable, Sue Fish, said: 'This is a truly wicked and callous crime. We will do everything in our power to find the people responsible.' </p> <p>Although Danielle was not in any kind of gang, tensions between rival groups of youths traditionally run high at this time of year. </p> <p>Superintendent David Colbeck, in charge of policing the area, appealed for anyone with information to come forward. 'She's 14. She's just a child,' he said. 'She's just going home with her friends from a good night out at Goose Fair. </p> <p>'She's not part of a gang who's been shot and killed. She's innocent, for God's sake. It could have been your daughter, your son. These people are evil and they need to go to prison.'</p>"
