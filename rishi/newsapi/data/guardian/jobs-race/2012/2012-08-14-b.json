  "<p>He's had, by any measure, a good games. But all that popularity and experience, so gruellingly earned, should not be frittered away on trivial concerns like writing memoirs or another sports administration role. If the opening ceremony proved anything, it is that Britons have imagination and are willing to take risks. So here's what Seb should be next.</p> <h2><strong>King</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Though constitutionally awkward, this would ensure that Britain's most popular leader can be followed by its second most popular when the sad time comes. The Queen will have to formally adopt Lord Coe and then arrange for the assassination of her two oldest children. (No doubt her new friend James Bond could arrange this.) Seb I does sound like an expensive number plate, but the nation would get used to it.</p> <h2><strong>Head of the European Central Bank</strong></h2> <p>Stabilising bond markets and rescuing insolvent governments should be simple for someone who can make Londoners cheerful for a fortnight. Seb has also proved that he can work with corrupt governing bodies, making him the perfect man to tackle Eurozone debt. May want to play down his committed Euroscepticism.</p> <h2><strong>Professional wrestler</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>A leftfield choice, but let's not rule it out. Seb was William Hague's judo partner after all, and his experience with the physical demands and slinky outfits of international athletics situates him perfectly for a \"good guy\" wrestling career. In Baron Coe of Ranmore OBE KBE he already has the silly name.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <h2><strong>Call centre operative</strong></h2> <p>Some would say that answering phones for NatWest or Virgin Media is a step down. At heart, however, the roles are similar, requiring someone who can remain equable while being moaned at for long periods of time. Hours could be difficult to combine with his duties in the House of Lords.</p>",
  "<p>A Muslim woman filed a federal suit against the Walt Disney Company on Monday on the grounds of religious discrimination and harassment. </p> <p>Imane Boudlal, a naturalized US citizen born in Morocco, says that while working at Disney's California theme park she endured harassment from supervisors and colleagues and faced discrimination for wearing a hijab before leaving the company in 2010. </p> <p>Boudlal asked her supervisors for permission to wear her hijab when she worked at the Storyteller's Cafe. Her request was denied and she was told that wearing the hijab would \"negatively affect patrons' experiences at the Storytellers Cafe.\"</p> <p>The 28-year-old also claims coworkers and supervisors accosted her with anti-Muslim and anti-Arab slurs, calling her \"terrorist\", \"camel\" and \"Kunta Kinte,\" in reference to the slave from Alex Haley's famous book Roots. Boudlal said colleagues also told her Arabs are terrorists, that she spoke a terrorist language and was trained to make bombs.</p> <p>\"Disneyland calls itself the happiest place on earth, but I faced harassment as soon as I started working there,\" Boudlal said in a statement.&#xa0;\"It only got worse when I decided to wear a hijab. My journey towards wearing it couldn't have been more American; it began at my naturalization ceremony I realized that I had the freedom to be who I want and freely practice my religion. Neither Disney nor anyone else can take that from me.\"</p> <p>When Boudlal told a manager about the harassment, she said they acknowledged it was a problem but took no action and said it would take time for a change. She filed her first written complaint three months after she started working at the cafe and continued to alert different supervisors to the harassment. Eventually, one told her to stop complaining. </p> <p>\"Walt Disney Parks and Resorts has a history of accommodating religious requests from cast members of all faiths,\" the company said in a statement. \"We presented Ms Boudlal with multiple options to accommodate her religious beliefs, as well as offered her several roles that would have allowed her to wear her own hijab. Unfortunately, she rejected all of our efforts and has since refused to come to work.\"</p> <p>Boudlal decided to wear her hijab in public a year after she started working at the theme park, but initially avoided wearing it to work because she thought she would be fired. When her request to wear it was denied, she offered to wear a hijab in colors matching her uniform or with a Disney logo. The company responded by telling her she could work in the back of the cafe where she wouldn't be seen by customers or wear a hat on top of her headscarf. </p> <p>Disney also <a href=\"http://ocresort.ocregister.com/2010/08/30/poll-what-should-muslim-disney-worker-do/54593/\">designed specialty uniforms</a> for Boudlal, an effort that worked with a different employee <a href=\"http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Noor-Abdallah-Disney-Muslim-103938878.html\">in 2010</a>, who was told she couldn't wear her hijab while working as a vacation planner at a Disney resort. </p> <p>Boudlal refused these options and said she was taken off the schedule and discharged. Disney says she was given the options for accommodations and chose not to return to work. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.aclu-sc.org/cases/disney/complaint/\">In a complaint</a> Boudlal filed with the ACLU of Southern California in the Central District of California, she asked Disney for punitive damages, a permanent injunction not to prohibit employees wearing hijabs and for company anti-harassment training to include Muslim issues.</p>",
  "<p>Whitehall's women leaders are much in demand. Dame <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/13/national-trust-helen-ghosh-director-general\" title=\"\">Helen Ghosh has been lured from her berth at the top of the&#xa0;Home Office by the prospect of running the National Trust</a>.

Others have been moved to cover vacancies \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2011/dec/09/lin-homer-top-job-hmrc\" title=\"\">Lin Homer was plucked from Transport</a> as Whitehall's best manager to take over HMRC when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/feb/08/dame-lesley-strathie-obituary\" title=\"\">Dame Lesley Strathie tragically died</a>.</p> <p>But the end result of the moves and departures we have seen since Gus O'Donnell proudly claimed an equal balance of men and women running Whitehall departments had been achieved is that Whitehall is reverting to stereotype, with men back in the clear majority.</p> <p>This pattern ought to concern the new leadership of the civil service. While Gus was clear in his determination to have a civil service leadership that looked more like its workforce (which is more than half female), the new knights at the top \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/news/new-head-of-the-civil-service-and-cabinet-secretary/welcome-letter\" title=\"\">Sir Bob Kerslake and Sir Jeremy Heywood</a> \u2013 have been highly conventional in their appointments. Philip Rutnam \u2013 with a background in the Treasury and more recently the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.roadsafetygb.org.uk/news/2100.html\" title=\"\">took over at Transport</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/chris-wormald/\" title=\"\">Chris Wormald moved back to Education</a> from the Cabinet Office. Ursula Brennan \u2013 a bold appointment to Defence two years ago \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/jun/13/ursula-brennan-permanent-secretary-ministry-justice\" title=\"\">was moved early to cover the vacancy at Justice</a>. That in turn was created by the departure of the only ethnic minority permanent secretary, <a href=\"http://www.ebrd.com/pages/news/press/2012/120703.shtml\" title=\"\">Suma Chakrabarti, to head the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</a>.</p> <p>The Cabinet Office response is that there are women coming through the pipeline \u2013 though Gus used to say that one of his concerns was that the progress at the top was not underpinned by similar progress lower down. But&#xa0;recent appointments suggest that pipeline is not strong enough.</p> <p>Of course women are not the only category to have been historically under-represented in the top echelons of Whitehall. The track record on ethnic minorities, on people with scientific as opposed to social science or arts backgrounds, with substantial private as opposed to public sector experience, is all pretty poor too. Diversity does not end by substituting Oxbridge woman for Oxbridge man. But Whitehall needs to&#xa0;draw on and encourage as wide a talent pool as possible \u2013 and to be seen&#xa0;to be doing so.</p> <p>So what next? There are four appointments up for grabs \u2013 at Defence, Home Office, <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Energy and Climate Change</a> and <a href=\"http://www.walesoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Wales</a> \u2013 all of which, three months ago, were held by women. Each will be individually made on merit. But if the best person for each of those jobs just happens to be a white man, those women and ethnic minorities will take the message and decide to look elsewhere, where their talents will be&#xa0;better appreciated.</p> <p>What to do? The first and most important move is to make sure that good candidates from a range of backgrounds are encouraged to apply for those jobs. The second is to make sure they are managed with an eye on the overall picture. But third is to have a positive plan to develop and support future talent \u2013 so that the next time Whitehall can claim some moves toward real equality, they can be made to last.</p> <p>Those signals matter. When I joined the Treasury, more than 30 years ago, there were three women at director level. When I left, 19 years later, there were three women at director level. Women were promoted, but with the one exception of the exceptional <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/nov/22/money.interviews\" title=\"\">Rachel Lomax</a>, they never got promoted in the Treasury. It wasn't until last January that the Treasury had its next woman policy DG after Rachel \u2013 Sharon White. The signal that the Treasury gave throughout my career was that women did not make it into senior management \u2013 and that has taken a long time to undo. The rest of the civil service must not fall into the same trap.</p>",
  "<p>A Labour police commissioner candidate who quit the race last Friday because of a minor offence committed 47 years ago has been reinstated after fresh legal advice.</p> <p>Alan Charles, Labour's candidate in Derbyshire, who has been vice-chairman of the county's police authority for the past three years, is to return to the campaign trail after a new legal opinion that the conditional discharge he received at the age of 14 in 1965 did not amount to a conviction.</p> <p>Charles, who has served as a councillor for more than 20 years believed a stringent rule that any past convictions, including those committed as a juvenile, which carry a sentence of imprisonment for those over 18 is enough to stop a candidate standing for the job of police and crime commissioner this November.</p> <p>Charles, who declared the offence, which he committed in 1965, to the Derbyshire police when he was vetted three years ago, said there was not even a police record of the incident.</p> <p>\"Due to a distinct lack of clarity from the Home Office we have sought further legal advice on behalf of Alan Charles, and it has become clear that he is eligible to become a police and crime commissioner candidate,\" said an East Midlands Labour party spokesperson.</p> <p>\"The Labour party has written to the Home Office calling for them to urgently provide more information and much greater clarity on the interpretation for all involved in these elections.\"</p> <p>There is however no such reprieve for first casualty of this stringent criminal record test in the paving legislation for the elections this November. That was Bob Ashford, Labour's candidate in Avon and Somerset, who had to stand down last Wednesday because of a minor offence he committed when he was 13 in 1966. He was fined \u00a35 for trespassing on the railway.</p> <p>The news followed a warning from the police minister, Nick Herbert, that a free mailshot for all voters in November's first elections for police and crime commissioners will cost \u00a325m-\u00a330m.</p> <p>His warning came in response to a protest by a group of independent candidates that the rules on the elections are biased in favour of the political parties.</p> <p>The protest at Downing Street and parliament on Tuesday has been organised by Ann Barnes, the chair of the Kent police authority for the past six years, and other independent candidates from Thames Valley and Sussex, who say the lack of a traditional free mailshot to every voter will make it difficult for them.</p> <p>\"It's quite perverse because we have the prime minister, the policing minister and the home secretary on record saying they want highly visible, strongly credible independent candidates to stand,\" said Barnes, who is to hand in a protest letter to Downing Street.</p> <p>\"And yet they will not give them the one thing&#xa0;\u2026 that will help them get their message out to voters. It's perverse, it's undemocratic and it's really unjust.\"</p> <p>She said that without a state-funded mailshot those representing political parties had an unfair advantage because they had more money and resources to run their campaigns.</p> <p>So far, 41 independent candidates have declared their intention to stand in 16 of the 41 police force areas in England and Wales. They include eight candidates from the English Democrats and the English Defence League, as well as former magistrates and police officers.</p> <p>The Electoral Commission warned in March that, as a result of the government's decision, up to 7 million people who did not use the internet could be disadvantaged.</p> <p>The former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott, who is standing as a candidate in Hull, described the move as scandalous.</p> <p>\"In my area of Humberside that will mean 170,000 people, mostly elderly, will be denied their democratic right to information on the candidates,\" he told the Lords.</p> <p>But the police minister told the BBC there would be a single national website with the details of every candidate's election address. Those who wanted to be sent a printed copy would be able to ring a helpline to request it.</p> <p>Herbert said he anticipated that several hundreds of thousands of voters would apply for printed copies of the election addresses but the \u00a325m-\u00a330m cost of posting them to every voter could not be justified \"in the current climate\".</p> <p>He said the success or failure of independent candidates would not turn on whether or not they had a free mailshot but on their use of the media, including new media, to capture local attention.</p> <p>The police minister repeatedly refused to set a benchmark for the turnout for the elections, which critics fear will be hit by voter apathy and poor quality candidates.</p>",
  "<p>Craig Levein has defended the decision to call up Rangers' Ian Black for Scotland's friendly against Australia, with the international manager also denying he has made contradictory comments about players at the Ibrox club.</p> <p>Levein's move to add Black as a late replacement to his party is notable given Rangers' current position in Scotland's Third Division. The midfielder is thus far uncapped.</p> <p>Last week Levein said: \"It is very difficult for anyone playing in the Third Division in Scotland to be up to the speed of an international match.\"</p> <p>Black's subsequent selection has angered some supporters. Levein said that the ex-Hearts player would have been called up for May's friendly in the United States, had he not been scheduled to undergo hernia surgery.</p> <p>\"My quotes are there for everyone to see,\" said Levein. \"What happened is that&#xa0;some people chose to take half a&#xa0;quote and use that. It is fairly straightforward. What I said when I announced the squad is that it will be more difficult for the Rangers players to get into the international team because the standard in the Third Division isn't akin to international football. That is what I said and also that the door wasn't closed on any of the Rangers players.</p> <p>\"We had some problems in midfield. Ian Black would have been with us in America if he hadn't been injured, so I brought him in. He is not a first choice, he is in as back-up and for me it's a fairly straightforward decision to make.\"</p> <p>Levein added: \"What I don't want to do, which seems to happen, is concentrate on one perceived negative story. This has been done to death as far as I am concerned. We have a lot of positive things happening and I would far rather talk about those than, no disrespect, a player that has been brought in as back-up.\"</p> <p>Huddersfield Town's Jordan Rhodes will spearhead the Scotland attack at Easter Road in what will be the 22-year-old's first international start.</p> <p>The visit of Australia, who are ranked 24th in the world which is 22 above tonight's hosts, marks Scotland's last outing before their 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign gets underway. In that encounter in the States, Levein's team were thumped 5-1.</p> <p>\"I discovered very quickly in this job that everybody reads everything into results so yes, of course, the result is important for us,\" Scotland's manager said. \"Our last result was a poor one so I would like to win the game. One of the frustrating things about&#xa0;this job \u2013 win or lose \u2013 is the time span&#xa0;between&#xa0;games.

  "<p>Brazil is now officially on track for the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics. In a bid to open the world's eyes to the real Brazil \u2013 past the flat-Earth vision of carnivals and caipirinhas \u2013 the government has put its weight behind a campaign set to shake up global debates on race.</p> <p>The campaign, \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuEOXwW6K88\" title=\"\">We R no race</a>\" (\"N\u00f3s n\u00e3o temos ra\u00e7a\"), offers free DNA testing to the public to prove there is only one race \u2013 the human race. Genome mapping reveals that human beings are actually 99.5% genetically identical; and that the majority of human genetic diversity exists <em>within</em> local populations, much less existing <em>between</em> local populations. In short, there is no <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Racial-Identities-Genetic-Ancestry-America/dp/0230110614/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344889543&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=sahra+gibbons\" title=\"\">genetic basis for race</a>.</p> <p>The project, led by <a href=\"http://www.laboratoriogene.com.br/sergio_pena.php\" title=\"\">Brazilian geneticist professor S\u00e9rgio Pena</a>, hopes to DNA test all footballers taking part in the 2014 World Cup, and potentially all Olympians in 2016. The Brazilian embassy in London is currently piloting the scheme, offering free DNA tests to the public. Brazil's minister of sport \u2013 Aldo Rebeldo \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.esporte.gov.br/ascom/noticiaDetalhe.jsp?idnoticia=9052\" title=\"\">was first in line</a> to take the test.</p> <p>In Brazil, the campaign has won high-level political support because of both internal and external factors. Within Brazil, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21543494\" title=\"\">pernicious socioeconomic inequalities</a> are visibly marked by skin colour differences. Meanwhile, in the global sports arenas, racist incidents at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/07/euro-2012-holland-racist-abuse?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Euro 2012</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/08/london-2012-olympic-racism-basketball\" title=\"\">Olympics</a> reveal that old habits die hard.</p> <p>The Brazilian vision looks set to reinvigorate debates over race on an international scale. First, it challenges the idea that racial differences exist, other than as a social construct. Second, it questions whether self-identifying by race might be harmful and hold minority groups back. Denying the scientific existence of race does not deny the existence of race as a social construct, and does not deny the very real impacts of racism. Instead, it seeks an alternative way to combat racism by deconstructing the foundations that support racist claims \u2013 the assumption of difference.</p> <p>This is a contentious position amid various highly politicised and historic debates. Brazil, Europe and the US all recognise racial identity through government policy, and contain large numbers of people who passionately self-identify according to race. In the US, famed novelist <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/may/24/big-changes-black-america/?pagination=false\" title=\"\">Tour\u00e9</a> criticises the post-racial position in favour of a post-black position:</p> <blockquote> \"Post-black does not mean 'post-racial'. Post-racial posits that race does not exist or that we're somehow beyond race and suggests colourblindness: It's a bankrupt concept that reflects a naive understanding of race in America.\" </blockquote> <p>However, in the UK, leading thinkers are beginning to question the impacts of racial categorisation in various fields (including education and mental health), and suggest a <a href=\"http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/issue/175/\" title=\"\">rethinking of race</a>. Crucially, each national debate is very much shaped by its own unique history. So, while one vision may make sense in one country, it may not in another. Brazilian slavery was brutal and lasted officially until 1888. However, there were high levels of mixing between the main three founding continental groups \u2013 Amerindians, Europeans and Africans \u2013 producing a multi-coloured society and a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Racial-Identities-Genetic-Ancestry-America/dp/0230110614/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344889543&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=sahra+gibbons\" title=\"\">weak correlation between colour and ancestry</a>.</p> <p>On Sunday, the UK passed the Olympic baton to Brazil, a symbolic moment to reflect on the Games that have been, and the Games that will come. Now one of the world's strongest economies, Brazil's influence on global culture can only grow. Could Brazil's vision inspire a cultural shift in the way we view race in the UK? In the globalised 21st century, will the very idea of race become an anachronism?</p>",
  "<p>Is there another franchise in the shooter genre that casts a longer shadow than Call Of Duty? Certainly Activision's FPS mammoth draws as much ire as it does admiration from the gaming community, but you can't argue with the statistics. Call Of Duty shatters through unit sales records as a matter of course, year in, year out. The last entry in the series, Modern Warfare 3, grossed a whopping $775m (\u00a3495m) in its first five days of release and its predecessor tops the franchise's highest-seller list, having shifted more than 23m copies to date. </p> <p>That last little piece of information probably weighs heavy on the collective minds at Treyarch, the developer behind the upcoming Call Of Duty: Black Ops 2. Since the first Black Ops is the biggest selling CoD entry of all time, expectations for its sequel have been pumped up to the point of absurdity. Whether or not Treyarch can top its personal best depends largely on Call Of Duty: Black Ops 2 living up to the hype, and a big part of this \u2013 the silver bullet, in fact \u2013 is down to the game's crucial multiplayer mode.</p> <p>First, the bad news: if you were a fan of the wager matches in Black Ops or, indeed, its in-game currency, which allowed some non-linear progression through the unlockables \u2013 too bad! They're now things of the past. Kill Streaks have gone too, although they exist in a more malleable form as Score Streaks. The big push with Black Ops 2, seems aimed at delivering as much customisation to the player as possible without breaking the overall balance.</p> <p>The Class Creation tools have been overhauled somewhat. Instead of a set rubric in which players are forced to pick a certain number of perks, weapons and pieces of equipment, in Black Ops 2, they're assigned 10 character points to spend as they please. Let's say, for example, you're a CoD player who hardly ever uses their secondary weapon. Well, in Black Ops 2, you don't need to select one; you simply cash it in for some extra points, and you can spend them something else. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394733029\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344946113657/turbine.jpg\" alt=\"Call of Duty: Black Ops 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Players can also buy up to three Wildcards (each costing a point), which allow them to bend the rules and configure their class further. The \"Perk Greed\" Wildcard, for example, allows players to select two Perks from the same category \u2013 such as Hardline and Flack Jacket. Wildcards can also be used to buy more weapon attachments or extra grenades. To maintain some sense of balance, there are upper limits on what the player can buy \u2013 you can't stroll into a match with five guns, for example. </p> <p>Once in a match, players will notice that the rejigged Score Streak system is more user-friendly than its Kill Streak predecessor. In the past, players had to string together a series of kills in order to call in useful items such as UAVs, rocket bombardments and K9 attack dogs. Now they're rewarded for what Treyarch has labelled \"positive gameplay\". Each Score Streak piece of equipment is assigned a numerical value, and once the player earns that value through their actions, the equipment is available for them to deploy. So, for example, if a player captures a flag (100pts), shoots an enemy on their way back to base (100pts) and then plants their flag at homeplate (100pts) they can then call in a UAV drone (300pts) having only fired one shot.</p> <p>The new equipment in the game is an absolute blast to use. A lot of the guns in the game look like revamped versions of the weapons in Modern Warfare, but there are some completely unique items in Black Ops 2's arsenal too, befitting its slightly futuristic setting. These include the Assault Shield, a metal riot shield that can be used as deployable cover, Shock Charges, that temporarily stun targets and the Millimeter (sic) Wave Scanner, that allows players to see stationary targets through walls (think about that, campers). </p> <p>The Score Streak rewards are equally satisfying. There are obviously the tried and tested assets, such as Care Packages and UAVs, and there are some re-skinned features too \u2013 an attack drone mini helicopter presents a smaller target, but it pretty much does the same thing as the Harrier from MW2. </p> <p>Then there are brand new items, such a remote drone that the player flings into the sky as soon as they unlock it, and it circles the battlefield until it finds a target \u2013 making it pretty much a guaranteed kill. There's also the HellStorm Missile, which works the same way as a Predator Missile, except that it can split off multiple warheads, decimating enemies moving together in a group. There are even a couple of non-lethal items such as The Guardian (no relation), a turret that emits a microwave pulse that slows down opponents. Stick this baby in the right section of the map and you can create a bottleneck filled with a lot of downed enemies. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394733030\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344946215835/aftermath-drone-guards.jpg\" alt=\"Call of Duty: Black Ops 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Players also have the option of taking control of some of their AI equipment remotely. Players can switch to the HUD of items such as attack drones or remote turrets and better direct their fire against foes. They can also leave the equipment to work remotely, if they so choose. </p> <p>There were four maps available at the multiplayer reveal: Cargo, Yemen, Turbine and Aftermath. Aftermath and Cargo were set in LA, the former featuring a decimated downtown area, and the latter set in a container bay at the docks. Yemen is a classic street battle set in a small town, while Turbine \u2013 my favourite of the lot \u2013 takes place in a canyon around a downed cargo plane. All of the maps look exquisite and favour the close-quarters run-and-gun style of gameplay COD is known for. Aside from Team Deathmatch, we were allowed to play the new Hardpoint match, which is essentially a version of King Of The Hill from Gears Of War 3.</p> <p>Everything the player does in the online mode earns them XP, and each new level offers them a new unlockable item. There are 55 levels in the game, and we're told that hitting the top level won't be enough to unlock all of the mode's content. This means that in order to obtain shiny new perks, guns and equipment beyond level 55 requires players to Prestige \u2013 and there are a further ten levels of that available. There are also a ton of medals, tags and baubles in the mode for players to collect for, as Treyarch puts it, \"doing something cool in a match\".</p> <p>Players now also have the option of playing in ranked matches, as one of the key pushes for Black Ops 2 is in the direction of the eSports market. To that end, they've introduced League Play, which offers skill-based matchmaking and seasonal ladders. If you start playing in the online Leagues, Black Ops 2's online mode will record your skill level, size you up, and plonk you in a league with players you have a chance of beating. Once you get into the habit of trouncing opponents on a regular basis, you move up to the next League in terms of skill-level. Quitting matches in League Play is punished harshly, by the way, as Treyarch doesn't want highly skilled killjoys to be able to drop down to the lower leagues and mess up anyone else's experience. </p> <p>Treyarch has also furnished its League Play mode with a new toolset allowing players to commentate on games, rather than play in them. The designated commentator \u2013 or CoDcaster \u2013 has an array of play-by-play features to allow them to fill out their uploads including Score Panels, Name Plates and different views they can use to follow the action. Treyarch says it has a streaming component in development, which will allow CoD-heads to follow matches on their tablets. </p> <p>Of course, whether eSports proves a substantial draw for the CoD faithful remains to be seen, but even without it, the online mode looks set to rack up impressive audience numbers. Overall, the focus in Call Of Duty: Black Ops 2's multiplayer is on quickness and customisation.</p> <p>Treyarch wants players to dive into this mode, work out their play preferences and then level up as quickly as possible. This doesn't mean that it'll be easy to become an elite player, but it makes Black Ops 2's online mode arguably the most accessible of its type in series. It's a sharp, brutal and compelling experience, and all of this bodes well for Black Ops 2's chances when it's released this November.</p>",
  "<p>Two interns who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/29/black-swan-interns-sue-studio\" title=\"\">last year sued Fox Searchlight over unpaid work</a> on the Oscar-winning film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/137726/black-swan\" title=\"\">Black Swan</a> are now expanding their legal action to include all internships at parent company Twentieth Century Fox, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/fox-black-swan-internship-program-lawsuit-361424\" title=\"\">according to the Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p> <p>Alex Footman and Eric Glatt's latest suit could have a major impact on working practices in Hollywood, where unpaid internships have risen in recent years. Fox itself says it changed its guidelines in July 2010 to ensure that all interns are paid at least $8 an hour. But the plaintiffs remain angry, claiming that they were made to undertake menial work with little or no educational value that ought to have been carried out by paid employees. The financial success of Black Swan, filmed in New York in 2009 prior to Fox's rule change, has also caused anger. Darren Aronofsky's intense psychological thriller earned more than $300m (\u00a3191m) at the global box office and won the best actress Oscar for its star Natalie Portman.</p> <p>The interns' motion, which will be considered next week at a federal court in Manhattan, asks a judge to \"broaden the scope of the case to include all interns who participated in Fox Entertainment Group's internship program\", citing evidence that \"the same hiring, personnel and company policies that applied to Searchlight interns applied to all interns who participated in FEG's internship program\". They seek compensation in the form of back payment for work done and a legal ruling that similar internships should not be offered in future.</p> <p>The motion also seeks to expand the suit to cover production interns, who worked on films that Fox Searchlight co-produced, as well as more than 100 \"corporate interns\", who worked through Fox's intern program. Two new plaintiffs, Eden Antalik and Kanene Gratts, are hoping to add their names to the legal action. The former worked through the intern programme and the latter worked on 2009's (500) Days of Summer, which was co-produced by Fox Searchlight.</p> <p>US law makes it clear that unpaid interns must gain educational benefit from their work experience and cannot be used to replace regular paid employees. Speaking to the New York Times in September, Footman said he spent his time on the Black Swan set making coffee, handling lunch orders, taking out rubbish and cleaning the production office. \"The only thing I learned on this internship was to be more picky in choosing employment opportunities,\" he complained. \"Black Swan had more than $300m in revenues. If they paid us, it wouldn't make a big difference to them, but it would make a huge difference to us.\"</p> <p>Glatt says he was employed as an unpaid accounting intern, which involved creating documents for purchase orders and petty cash, going to the set for signatures and making spreadsheets to track missing information in personnel files. \"When I started looking for opportunities in the industry, I saw that most people accept an ugly trade-off,\" he said. \"If you want to get your foot in the door on a studio picture, you have to suck it up and do an unpaid internship.\"</p> <p>Twentieth Century Fox has so far made no public comment on the new motion. In September the studio argued that interns were working for Aronofsky's production company, rather than directly for the studio \u2013 a point which the new legal motion seems designed to bypass. \"These are completely meritless claims aimed solely at getting press coverage for the litigants and their attorneys,\" said a spokesperson at the time of the original legal action.</p>",
