  "<p><strong>Born in 1935, Andr\u00e9 Brink is one of South Africa's most distinguished writers and a key figure in the modernisation of the Afrikaans novel. His books - including his most famous, </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780749399894/a-dry-white-season\" title=\"\"><strong><em>A Dry White Season</em></strong></a><strong> (1979) - have explored varied themes, among them South Africa's colonial history and apartheid legacy. His 21st novel, <em>Philida</em>, has been longlisted for this year's Man Booker prize. He lives in Cape Town with his wife, Karina.</strong></p> <p><strong>The eponymous protagonist in <em>Philida</em> is a 19th-century slave living on a farm in South Africa's Western Cape run by your ancestors. How hard was it to write in her voice?</strong></p> <p>On the one hand, extremely difficult. On the other, imagining yourself into the skin, life, thoughts of another human being is really what a writer does from the first moment. There was a particular audacity and bloody cheek involved as a white person in imagining yourself into the skin of a black woman but over so many years, the coming together of black and white has entered so deeply into my subconscious that perhaps the effort did not need to be too extreme.</p> <p><strong>You fictionalise some of your own family history in the book and there are passages where you describe Philida being sexually and physically abused by your own forebears. How did that affect&#xa0;you?</strong></p> <p>Very deeply. I was only too aware at every step of the way what dangerous territory I was treading on. It made the challenge huge. At the same time, there was a very deep and peculiar sense of fulfilment.</p> <p><strong>You explore long-term sexual relationships between Afrikaner masters and their slaves. How much&#xa0;was this based on fact?</strong></p> <p>It happened to an amazing extent. To me, one of the discoveries of writing the book was that for so many years, the idea of racial purity became so deeply embedded under apartheid that one got the impression that this kind of miscegenation was the exception rather than the rule. It was astounding to discover how much it was the rule, rather than the exception.</p> <p><strong>Has South Africa come to terms with its apartheid legacy?</strong></p> <p>We're still at a very difficult stage, trying to battle through. I went to a conference in Oklahoma a few years ago and it was one of the most remarkable experiences because I was surrounded by present-day white Americans who were becoming more interested in the miscegenation in their own families. They almost took pride in it, vying with one another to expose the extent to which their own families had this experience. We're not quite there yet in South Africa but it is happening more and more.</p> <p><strong>Rian Malan, another writer of Afrikaner descent, struggled with his heritage in his memoir, </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/politics/9780099749004/my-traitors-heart\" title=\"\"><strong><em>My Traitor's Heart</em></strong></a><strong>. You were raised by Afrikaner nationalist parents: did you face a similar personal crisis?</strong></p> <p>On the whole, my approach to it has always been much more positive, in the sense of discovering new and wonderful things, rather than feeling animosity shoot up all around me. I've never been a Rian Malan fan because he's got such a bleak and black outlook on the world and that's not been my experience.</p> <p>Even though my father [a magistrate] was a staunch supporter of apartheid, he had a very deep-rooted sense of right and wrong\u2026 He had very interesting contrasts within him as a person.</p> <p><strong>What would he have made of <em>Philida</em>?</strong></p> <p>I'm not so sure he would have liked it very much. My mother would have loved it. She was always interested on a purely human level and concerned with the humanity of the individual and not, as my father was, in the political divisions between people.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel you've achieved what you set out to do as a writer?</strong></p> <p>It's such a difficult question to answer. In a very deep and personal sense, I feel it's worth it. But as TS Eliot put it: \"Every attempt / Is a wholly new start, and a different kind of failure.\"</p> <p>That, too, can be turned into a positive experience because every time I finish a book and I think, \"No, I haven't been able to achieve what I wanted\", that gives me more reason to try again.</p> <p><strong>You've been married six times. What is your policy on allowing spouses to read what you're writing?</strong></p> <p>I've had the good or bad fortune that a few of my wives have had not the slightest interest in what I do. My present wife is Polish and has a remarkable life behind her... For the first time I find I can really share everything about my writing. She has had a lot to do with this book. It was the biggest battle of my life to get this book done and if it hadn't been for her input and constant presence, I would have given up several times along the way.</p>",
  "<p>The familiar title comes from the book about poetic myth by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jul/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview7\" title=\"\">Robert Graves</a>, the \"Grand-uncle\" of the author (\"Great is for steamships and railway lines, don't you think? Grand is for fathers and uncles, and Russian dukes, of course!\"), around whom this fictionalised \u2013 but only slightly \u2013 memoir revolves.</p> <p>Gough first met Graves, his great uncle, aged 11, when he visited the writer of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/jul/13/top-10-books-rome\" title=\"\"><em>I, Claudius</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/literary-criticism/9780241951415/goodbye-to-all-that\" title=\"\"><em>Goodbye to All That</em></a> in his adopted home of Dei\u00e0, Mallorca. It was a bleak period for Gough (his actor parents were divorcing), but he found such happiness in this bohemian demi-paradise of mountains and Mediterranean Sea that he devised a private, mystical sacrificial rite in order to return.</p> <p>When he did, aged 18 and on his way to university in Madrid, he found Graves under the influence of an \"extraordinary\" muse, Margot Callas, who was possessed by the \"Triple Goddess\" and proved an inspiration for poems such as Symptoms of Love. Young Gough fell under her spell too, but kept his passion secret from his great uncle. Under the pressure of Graves's demands, the love triangle unravels unexpectedly, leaving the author in a situation beset by divided loyalties and lies.</p> <p>Impassioned, with all the intensive drama a youthful affair entails, this \"autobifantasy\" (as Gough calls it) is as much about a love of a place \u2013 the freedom and beauty of Dei\u00e0 contrasts with the brutality of Franco's Madrid \u2013 as of a person. In fact, some of the finest parts of the book are not about Callas but the touching portrait of Graves and his wife Beryl; a tender, observant record both of their relationship and their real selves in their later years.</p>",
  "<p>The British biographer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/fiona-maccarthy\">Fiona MacCarthy</a> and the American novelist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/padgett-powell\">Padgett Powell</a> have been named the winners of the <a href=\"http://www.ed.ac.uk/news/events/tait-black/introduction\">James Tait Black Memorial Prizes 2012</a> at an award ceremony held at Edinburgh International Book Festival.</p> <p>MacCarthy won the the biography category with her life of Edward Burne-Jones, The Last Pre-Raphaelite, while Powell won the fiction prize with his latest novel, You and I.</p> <p>Speaking at the event MacCarthy said that writing the book was \"pure enjoyment from start to finish\". </p> <p>\"I'm thrilled and excited to have won this wonderful prize,\" she said, \"which I think of as one of the most serious literary prizes still in existence.\"</p> <p>Powell thanked the students who had chosen his book and the fiction category judge, Dr Lee Spinks, for \"ratifying the decision\".</p> <p>MacCarthy's biography of British artist and designer Edward Burne-Jones was praised for its \"sharp focus\" by category judge Dr Jonathan Wilde, while Spinks hailed the originality of Powell's novel, a freewheeling dialogue between two old men which runs over subjects from fishing to childhood, from movie stars to death.</p> <p>The James Tait Black prizes are Britain's oldest literary awards, established in 1919. Postgraduate students and staff from the University of Edinburgh's literature department choose the prize, with each student reading 12 books. Staff members Wilde and Spinks decided the shortlist and final prizes. Each winner is awarded \u00a310,000.</p> <p>The University of Edinburgh's literature department celebrates its 250th anniversary this year with a search for the best of the James Tait Black prize. An overall fiction winner from the prize's 93-year history will be awarded in December at a ceremony in London.</p>",
  "<p>The deaths of five swimmers killed by sharks in the waters off Western Australia in the past 12 months have led local officials to consider ending the ban on the killing of great whites.</p> <p>\"There's no documented account of fatal attacks attributed to white sharks in such a short time and geographic location, anywhere in the world, than what we have experienced in Western Australia and action is necessary to deal with it,\" said the state minister of fisheries, Norman Moore, in the wake of the latest fatal attack in July. \"I think we need to have another look to see whether there's been a significant increase in great white numbers since they became protected. And if that's the case, should they still be on a protected list?\"</p> <p>Moore asked for urgent clarification from Canberra on the shark's status as a protected species. Since 1999, the animals have been listed as \"rare or likely to become extinct\" and fishing or culling them has been banned.</p> <p>Many conservationists believe they should remain protected. \"Australia has an immense moral and legal responsibility to protect great white sharks in our waters,\" said Alexia Wellbelove, from the Humane Society International.</p> <p>The latest fatality was Ben Linden, 24, who was surfing 200 metres offshore when a great white bit him in half, according to witnesses. A would-be rescuer on a jet ski was driven away by the shark. Theories to explain the number of attacks range from increasing populations of seals, sea lions and whales that the sharks feed on, to there being more people in the water each year as Western Australia's population grows.</p> <p>What is clear to scientists is that the sharks are now bigger. Professor Shaun Collin from Western Australia University's Oceans Institute, said: \"There's no doubt that the bans have allowed the sharks to grow to greater maturity.\" He thinks removing them from the protected list would be a mistake. \"Sharks may be apex predators but they are also a very important part of the ecosystem and if you remove them, there can be hugely detrimental effects on whole species, as new predators step up to where the white sharks were.</p> <p>\"The big question is why there have the been so many attacks in the past year. There's been something about Western Australia in that time that has brought them closer and that's what we need to find out.\"</p> <p>The federal government says it is reviewing its great white protection plan, but getting accurate information is not easy. Only about 100 great white sharks have ever been tagged or sampled in Australian waters.</p> <p>\"Trying to find them is like looking for a needle in a haystack because they roam across such large distances and don't necessarily hang out in groups,\" said <a href=\"http://www.biology.uq.edu.au/staff/john-pandolfi\" title=\"\">Professor John Pandolfi</a> from Queensland University, whose recent study on great whites established that there are two genetic populations in Australia, one on the east coast and another that travels between South and Western Australia.</p> <p>Last week at Perth's Cottesloe beach, where Bryn Martin, 64, was killed by a shark last October, swimmers from the surf club were enjoying the water. Around a dozen women aged 60-90 swim up and down the beach for 20 minutes each day. They stick closer to the shore now than they used to. \"We err on the side of caution and only swim about 20 metres off the shore, in water that's waist-deep,\" said Jean Burling, 67, who swims at Cottesloe every day.</p> <p>Surf clubs have been given fresh instructions on shark sightings and encouraged to put posters up about shark safety. At Cottesloe, there are beach patrols and a helicopter monitors the coastline.</p>"
