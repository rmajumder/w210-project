  "<p>Workers' rights groups behind a series of strikes at Walmart stores across the US are now targeting Black Friday for the next stage of a campaign they say is aimed at improving labour conditions and stopping alleged retaliation against their members.</p> <p>In recent weeks, a wave of small walkouts have hit Walmart stores in at least 28 locations in 12 different states, as a union-supported campaign group, Making Change at Walmart, and other organisations agitate for improved wages, more flexible hours and an end to what they say are punishments \u2013 such as reduced shifts \u2013 handed out to workers seeking to organise themselves.</p> <p>On a conference call with journalists hosted by MCW's director, Dan Schlademan, numerous Walmart workers who have taken part in strike actions outlined plans to try and disrupt Walmart's operations on November 23, the day after Thanksgiving and traditionally the busiest shopping day of the year in the US.</p> <p>Colby Harris, a full-time Walmart worker in Dallas, said that the action would involve demonstrations, strikes, leafleting and flashmob protests at stores all over the US. \"We are going to do everything it takes to make sure change is made,\" Harris said. Fellow Walmart worker Evelin Cruz, who works at a store in California, said that workers would see to educate the millions of shoppers who flock to stores to snap up bargain goods as part of the holiday celebrations. \"We are in this process because Walmart does not want to come to terms with what is going on in their stores,\" she said.</p> <p>Union groups and other labour-sympathetic organisations have long seen Walmart \u2013 the biggest private employer in the world \u2013 as a major target. They say the firm pays low wages, does not offer enough benefits and is an implacable opponent of organised labour. Walmart insists that the protesters are a tiny minority of its 1.4 million workers in America, and that it pays solid wages at a time of economic hardship.</p> <p>Walmart spokesman Dan Fogleman said that operations across the country had not been affected by the strike. \"All of our stores are open. They are completely staffed up, and they are taking care of our customers,\" he said.</p> <p>Fogleman added that the protests appeared to be a platform for labour unions to try to enter Walmart's workforce. \"The unions have wanted to organise Walmart for years. This is just a publicity stunt,\" Fogleman said.</p> <p>The recent strikes have been organised by a group called Our Walmart, which is closely linked to the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. Our Walmart, which has not sought union recognition from Walmart, is trying to organise thousands of employees to lobby and protest for higher wages and improved benefits.</p> <p>The Black Friday action was decided upon by leaders of OUR Walmart on Tuesday night at a gathering in Walmart's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, where the group is protesting senior Walmart executives. At the same time, pro-labour groups have taken out adverts in five local Arkansas newspapers featuring portraits of senior company figures and calling for them to improve labour conditions.</p> <p>On Black Friday, Our Walmart is set to get support from various national bodies, including the National Consumers League, the National Organisation of Women (NOW) and the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement. \"We are standing in solidarity with with the workers who walking off the job,\" said Terry O'Neill, the president of NOW, who promised her organisation's members would take action on the day, too.</p>",
  "<p>Tuesday was yet another wild day in the world of polling. The immediate picture is that it was mostly good news for Team Romney, though a <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/09/cnn-poll-race-tightening-up-in-battleground-ohio/\">CNN/ORC poll</a> from Ohio gives Obama an edge. Let's drill down some of the important points in the latest data and about where the race stands.</p> <p><strong>1). Romney is ahead in the national polls</strong></p> <p>For the first time since 2011, Romney leads in the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html\">Real Clear Politics average</a>. His lead is a little under a single point, yet this may actually be underestimating Romney's edge. The Real Clear average does not include either the <a href=\"http://americanresearchgroup.com/pres2012/NA12.html\">American Research Group</a> poll that has Romney up a point or the <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/weeklypolling/2012/10/4\">Public Policy Polling</a> survey that has Romney ahead by 2 points. Indeed, there hasn't been a single national poll conducted post-debate among likely voters that has Romney trailing.</p> <p>There had been a <a href=\"http://prospect.org/article/romneys-47-percent-ceiling\">lot of chatter</a> that Romney was unable to put together a coalition to help him attain a plurality of the vote. He has now shown he can do it. Moreover, Romney's lead marks an importance difference between this campaign and 2004, a year noted for its <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/04/2012-election-is-bush-kerry-in-reverse.html\">remarkable similarities</a> to 2012. John Kerry never led in the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2004/president/us/general_election_bush_vs_kerry-939.html\">October polling average</a> in 2004. It's a good time for Romney to catch fire, if it holds.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>2). The switch to likely voters among pollsters continues to help Mitt Romney</strong></p> <p>Let's face it: Democrats have an <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/07/chuck-todd-republican-voters_n_1946586.html\">enthusiasm problem</a>. Yes, every vote counts the same as the next, but only if it's cast. Pollsters across the board continue to find Mitt Romney supporters are more likely to vote than President Obama's. The latest two installments are <a href=\"http://news.investors.com/special-report/508415-ibdtipp-poll.aspx\">IBD/TIPP</a> and, more importantly, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/157955/romney-obama-among-likely-voters.aspx\">Gallup</a>.</p> <p>Gallup produced a 3-point Obama advantage among registered voters in its seven-day tracker, but most of the blogosphere was taken up with Mitt Romney leading by 2 points among <em>likely</em> voters \u2013 a 5-point gap. That's a large difference, but it isn't unprecedented. Gallup's final <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/polls/usatodaypolls.htm\">2004 poll</a> produced a 4-point difference between John Kerry and George W Bush, with Bush taking likely voters by 2 points. The likely voter poll was correct in this instance.</p> <p>My blogging buddy Nate Cohn <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/108342/romneys-gain-among-likely-voters-not-unusual\">points out</a> that Gallup initially had a wide likely and registered voter gap in 2008, which shrank during the course of October. 2004 showed no such shrinkage; in fact, the gap got wider. Still, the two results indicate that the likely and registered voter gap is not necessarily stable.</p> <p><strong>3). Romney's losing momentum \u2013 or perhaps he isn't</strong></p> <p>Another Gallup headline was that their registered voter results in the last two days, an Obama 5-point lead, matched their survey <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/157955/romney-obama-among-likely-voters.aspx\">just prior to the debate</a>. Obama also added 2 points to the three-day Gallup approval rating among adults. He now stands at 53% approval among this population. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/08/romney-debate-bounce-real-but-fading\">As I pointed out Monday</a>, it's not the only data to indicate that Romney's debate bump may be stalling.</p> <p>There is, however, data suggesting Romney's decline could just be a statistical anomaly. <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/obama_administration/daily_presidential_tracking_poll\">Rasmussen shows</a> a tie, as it did Monday, and Obama's approval rating actually dropped a point there. The <a href=\"http://ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=5815\">Reuters/Ipsos</a> tracking poll has Obama falling to his lowest level since the Democratic convention.</p> <p>Also \u2013 and, admittedly, this is somewhat confusing \u2013 Obama's Sunday Gallup data was better than the previous Sunday, but this Monday was worse for him than last Monday. That suggests Obama may have had a monster Sunday that pushed up his two-day Sunday/Monday average against Romney, yet it shouldn't be mistaken for a greater trend. We need at least a few more days of data to know for sure if this was merely a Romney blip or a surge with more long-lasting impact.</p> <p><strong>4). The blue state \"wall\" seemingly holds, but \u2026</strong></p> <p>Had CNN/ORC produced a Romney lead in the swing state of Ohio, it would have marked the crumbling of an Obama firewall that has been secure this entire election. Instead, Obama has stayed ahead by 4 points, 51% to 47%, in the survey. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/oh/ohio_romney_vs_obama-1860.html\">average lead</a> for Obama in five post-debate Ohio polls stands at about a point. A number of those surveys are from firms that don't call cellphones or have a less than stellar reputation. The reliable <a href=\"http://battlegroundwatch.com/2012/10/09/obama-1-in-ohio-surveyusanbc4/\">SurveyUSA does</a>, however, show Obama only ahead by a single point. So we shouldn't take CNN's numbers and run to the bank with them.</p> <p>There are additional signs that Romney is catching up to Obama in other states in which the president had led. <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/polls/siena-15617\">Siena College</a> found Obama's lead down to 3 points in Pennsylvania \u2013 a much tighter margin than previous polls had found in the state. <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/polls/epic-mra-15605\">EPIC-MRA</a> shows Romney rising \u2013 though, importantly, Obama not falling \u2013 to only 3 points behind Obama in Michigan. Nevada also seems to be getting tighter: <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2012/election_2012_presidential_election/nevada/election_2012_nevada_president\">Rasmussen</a>, who has actually shown better numbers for Obama recently than many other surveys, found a tie in Nevada.</p> <p>I should note (as I have said before): <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/03/national-polls-swing-state-election\">states tend to follow the national trend</a>. That trend has Romney pulling ahead nationally. It would be difficult for Obama to win the electoral college, if he loses the popular vote by a point or more.</p> <p><strong>5). Don't lose your head</strong></p> <p>I may feed the addiction, but don't take any one poll result too seriously. You can look at the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/pollster/\">Huffington Post Pollster aggregate</a> or even our <a href=\"http://www.ismittromneythepresident.com/\">balloon average</a> (a visual representation of the Real Clear Politics data). There are still plenty of days and data left. You'll make yourself a nervous wreck if you treat each poll result as either victory virtually within grasp or the end of the world.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion: the election, if held today, is too close to call</strong></p> <p>You don't need a fancy formula to look at the data and see the race is within a point either way. It's quite possible that Obama will open up a lead again in the coming days. It's also possible that he won't. All I can say for certain right now is this race is exciting.</p>"
