  "<p>I'm pleased with the way I look, considering I'm 58. Not too much damage has been done \u2013 even my eyes aren't particularly wrinkled. If I could change anything, I'd be a&#xa0;couple of inches taller. I can't wear heels any more, since doing so much running, and in my flats I'm 5ft 6in.</p> <p>These days, I run on a treadmill as it's easier on the joints. But dog-walking is better \u2013 when there are two eyes looking up at you, desperately needing a walk, there's no excuse.</p> <p>I don't have much of a skincare routine. I brush off dead cells, which brightens my complexion, and moisturise morning and night \u2013 I've always done that, and it's really paid off. And I've generally stayed out of the sun, under my hat.</p> <p>Most people don't think I'm as old as I am, which is great. But also slightly depressing, somehow \u2013&#xa0;I&#xa0;think women are valued more for their looks than men. I've got big boobs and wear clothes that disguise them, otherwise I don't think men would ever look past them.</p> <p>Being adopted by white parents meant that, for a long time, I didn't really have any black role models. That changed when I discovered Marsha Hunt and Diana Ross, who were the first beautiful black women I'd seen. On TV, back then, black women were usually maids. It also meant no one in my family knew what to do with my hair. I still don't&#xa0;worry about it \u2013 I've not been to a&#xa0;hairdresser in 10 years.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846687914\" title=\"\"><strong>Black By Design: A 2-Tone Memoir</strong></a><strong>, by Pauline Black, is out now, published by Serpent's Tail at \u00a38.99. </strong></p>",
  "<h2>THIS STORY CONSISTS OF A VERY LARGE QUANTITY OF TEDIOUS WAFFLE AND LITTLE IN THE WAY OF HARD NEWS OR USEFUL INFORMATION. A PERFECT METAPHOR FOR TRANSFER DEADLINE DAY, IF YOU WILL</h2> <p>Sky Sports News long ago completed a successful landgrab for ownership of Transfer Deadline Day, the depressing waste of time everyone pretends to enjoy even though there's no point. Now it's theirs, and the undoubted star of the day is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MWsO-Fz9Aw\" title=\"\">erstwhile Chris Evans wannabe</a>, the rich man's Tim Lovejoy, Jim White. Over the years, he's become the face of this futile charade, all smiles and shouting and faux excitement, like the manically gurning guy in the kitchen trying to keep the party going in the wee hours even though everyone knows the adult confectionery has been wearing off for quite a while now.</p> <p>Transfer Claus, they're calling him this time round. Transfer Claus. But it's easy to be cynical and mock the likes of White for his unique brand of relentless diabetes-inducing positivity, a happiness so sugary it coats the teeth as well as covering the entire end of the tit. At least he's putting in the effort, painting on a gameface and doing his level best to dress up this abject nonsense in a manner which keeps at least young children, and people who have recently been affected by serious traffic incidents, occupied if not quite entertained.</p> <p>There's also, in that twinkle in his eye, a sense of self-awareness, a full and knowing realisation that this is the most ludicrous dance performed since the manically gurning guy in the kitchen desperately attempted to convince himself that the entertainment talc wasn't nine-tenths St Ivel Five Pints. So hats off to White for having the professionalism to resist phoning it in. The Fiver, faced with a similar task of reporting that Maicon and Scott Sinclair have gone to Manchester City, Joao Moutinho and Hugo Lloris have joined Spurs, Charlie Adam has gone to Stoke, and Clint Dempsey really has painted himself into a corner at Fulham, simply couldn't summon the energy.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"So happy and humble\" \u2013 Nicklas <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wgWEIi1PHk\" title=\"\">'Don't you know who I am, I can buy the whole pizzeria'</a> Bendtner signs for Juventus.

  "<p>Approaching the end of my masters was a very daunting experience. As soon as I mentioned to qualified practitioners that I was trying to find work as a newly qualified social worker (NQSW), almost everyone was quick to offer me copious amounts of advice: apply for what you are good at; keep your CV concise; focus on your positives; be on time for the interview; dress smartly, but not too smart. All the advice was good \u2013 however there were five pieces of advice that were particularly useful in practice.</p> <h2>Be persistent </h2> <p>For the first few weeks I applied to numerous jobs with no response, which is both disheartening and stressful. My first piece of advice, therefore, is to be persistent. As a NQSW, it is often the case that most employers are looking for people with a minimum of two years experience, making it particularly hard to begin your career in social work. Do not get disheartened. If you apply for three or four jobs a day, your hard work will eventually pay off.</p> <h2>Be clear</h2> <p>Go through the job and worker descriptions and extract the key criteria they are looking for. When filling in the application form, place each criterion as a heading and use examples from practice to demonstrate how you have met those criteria. It may seem simplistic but if you are explicit that you are suitable for the job role, then an interview is guaranteed.</p> <h2>Be creative </h2> <p>Social work is more than working for a local authority. Speak to other people you have studied with to find out what placements they did. The voluntary sector offers some amazing opportunities for social work practice, as do social enterprises. Explore charity websites; there may be the perfect job for you that you were not even aware of.</p> <h2>Be brave </h2> <p>If you are applying for a job which does not openly state that it will contribute to your assessed and supported year in employment (ASYE), do not be afraid to ask in the interview if your employers would be willing to consider supporting you through this. The worst they can do is say no, and many employers will be happy to.</p> <h2>Be yourself </h2> <p>It may sound cliched, but one of the best pieces of advice I received is: be yourself. Do not over-think what you should wear to the interview, how you should sit or speak or what answers they want to hear from you. If you attend the interview as true to yourself as possible and the interview is unsuccessful, then it is more than likely that the job was not the right one for you and it would not have made you happy.</p> <p>I know for many of my colleagues who studied with me, finding employment is an ongoing struggle, however I am sure with determination and creativity their job search will pay off. After two months of persistent applications, I was lucky enough to receive three job offers, allowing me the luxury of choosing the right career path for me.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-social-care-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the social care network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>"
