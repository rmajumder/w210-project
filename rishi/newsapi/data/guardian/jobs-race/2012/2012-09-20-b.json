  "<p>Next Wednesday, four women and 15 men on the Crown Nominations Commission will gather for two days of prayer and horsetrading to replace Rowan Williams as archbishop of Canterbury. We know who they are, and when they will meet \u2013 but not where, so they can't be doorstepped.</p> <p>Only three members of the commission, chaired by the former Conservative arts minister Lord Luce, are bishops. One of the women and two of the men have no vote, but are there to advise. Five, including one of the women, are priests. The rest are lay people. Almost all the parties of the church are represented and there is even Dr Barry Morgan, a Welshman, to represent the rest of the world for the first time in this process. They will pick two names to present to the prime minister, who is bound to choose the first, unless he proves unable to take the job.</p> <p>The man they choose will have at least five jobs at once in his new post, and very little power in any of them. He is a bishop in Kent. He sits in the House of Lords. He chairs meetings of the bishops of all England. In some very nebulous sense he is also the leader of the Anglican communion, a worldwide body with no agreed doctrine and no discipline, which has rejected all attempts to supply it with either. If the Queen dies, he will crown her successor. When the nation requires religious pageantry, he must supply it and star in it.</p> <p>\"The next man has got to be able to hold together the Anglican communion, and to stare down the loony left and the loony right on sexual questions,\" says Stephen Kuhrt, a south London vicar who represents centrist evangelical opinion. \"There are those who want a split as soon as possible, but the vast majority of Anglicans want a working compromise on sexuality. We need someone who can communicate a bit more on a popular level than Rowan, and is a bit tougher.\"</p> <p>This time last year the two main candidates were John Sentamu, the archbishop of York, and Richard Chartres, the bishop of London. Neither filled the church with much enthusiasm. Sentamu wanted the job too obviously. Chartres has refused to ordain women. Both men are in their 60s, and Sentamu is not in perfect health. This matters because if one of the jobs of the archbishop is to run the Anglican communion \u2013 well, to head it, since it is not a body coherent enough to run \u2013 he must be in shape for the next Lambeth Conference in 2018, when most of the Anglican bishops of the world will come together.</p> <p>During the Occupy crisis last year, Charters originally wanted the protestors cleared away, but after Giles Fraser resigned the bishop reversed position with blinding speed and conviction. Chartres is hugely experienced, having served as Robert Runcie's chaplain, and he can point to the fact that church attendance in his diocese has grown over the last decade.</p> <p>Sentamu's qualifications are drive, intelligence and a gift for theatre. As a black African former asylum seeker he is able to praise British patriotism extravagantly. He seems at home as a columnist for the Sun on Sunday, where he writes things such as: \"We shouldn't be shy about saying how great our country is.\" He inspires devotion in his staff but two people separately said to me he will never get the job because he sat on the appointments committee for five years, and some of his former colleagues there are determined that he should not. He has drifted out in the betting.</p> <p>\"John Sentamu is a great public face for Christianity in this country, but not a great manager of people,\" says Kuhrt. \"Of course, in this job you do have to challenge the Captain Mainwarings if you want anything to happen.\"</p> <p>Beyond them, candidates are less obvious. Among the younger bishops the bookies early anointed Christopher Cocksworth, bishop of Coventry, as favourite. He is an evangelical, ran a theological college, and he hasn't offended any powerful lobbies. But reports from his diocese suggest that he hasn't offended anyone only because he can't take decisions. Sentiment has quietly but decisively swung away from him.</p> <p>James Jones, the bishop of Liverpool, who has just chaired the Hillsborough inquiry, is another possible caretaker choice. Although he has a firm evangelical background, he is sympathetic to gay clergy and an enthusiastic green. He had heart surgery last year, and though a fluent speaker, he lacks the star quality possessed in their different ways by both Sentamu and Chartres.</p> <p>Graham James, the bishop of Norwich, is favourite everywhere of the steady-as-she-goes party. He is widely experienced \u2013 he worked in Lambeth Palace under the previous archbishop, Lord Carey \u2013 and widely trusted, as well as scholarly. But critics say he has the charisma of a tea cosy and exemplifies the benevolent but out-of-touch quality of a church cut off from the mainstream of English life.</p> <p>Outsiders include Nick Baines, the newly appointed bishop of Bradford. He is active on Twitter, where journalists notice him, and he is both interested in the media and largely unafraid of it. He is an evangelical, which ticks one important box, but youth (he's 51) and inexperience should tell against him.</p> <p>Another possible is John Inge, bishop of Worcester, a former public schoolmaster favoured by some centrist evangelicals. He is the author of an unlikely work of theology, Living Love, which takes as its starting point the detective novels of Alexander McCall Smith.</p> <p>Liberals make wistful noises about Stephen Cottrell, the bishop of Chelmsford. He was the man with briefly the worst job in the church \u2013 brought in as the unimpeachably heterosexual bishop of Reading after Williams lost his nerve in the face of a concerted and international evangelical campaign and forced his old friend Jeffrey John, a celibate gay man, to withdraw from the post. That was in many ways the defining catastrophe of Williams's term in office, and his surrender ensured that bitter infighting over gay clergy would continue for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>\"Stephen Cottrell has got nous, native wit, and common sense. It is an impossible job, but we are ready for someone to say, when a crisis comes along, like the banking crisis, 'Look, this is bad' and to do so in a joined up, cogent, and clear way,\" says Rachel Boulding, deputy editor of the Church Times.</p> <p>But Cottrell also has limited experience and is too friendly to gay clergy and gay rights to be acceptable to most evangelical opinion.</p> <p>This leaves the dark horse, whom no one was discussing a year ago, yet now seems to lead the field: Justin Welby, the bishop of Durham. The reason why Welby was never discussed earlier is also the big strike against him. He wasn't even a bishop this time last year, but dean of Liverpool. He was only consecrated as bishop in the new year. This also means that he has made no enemies yet.</p> <p>Welby is an evangelical; he's also an old Etonian. But people who might be repelled by either or both of these traits tend not to be in practice. He charmed Giles Fraser, for example. He is thoughtful about the Church of England's problems. If these were primarily financial, he would be the outstanding candidate. Not only did he have a successful career as an oil trader before seeking ordination, he turned around the finances of Liverpool Cathedral when he ran it.</p> <p>None of the candidates will bring comfort to a Tory government. The most establishment candidates are Chartres and Welby. But Chartres is a Prince Charles-type Tory who wants less capitalism and more hierarchy. Welby has been an informed critic of the banks. Sentamu was stopped and searched eight times by the Metropolitan police while he was bishop of Stepney, and served on the Macpherson committee that accused the force of institutionalised racism.</p> <p>Whoever he is, the next archbishop will face other large problems, even though the issue of female bishops will probably not be among them. It looks as if a form of words has been agreed which both supporters and opponents can accept, so that the first will be consecrated next year.</p> <p>The struggle over gay clergy will continue for the foreseeable future. Opinion within congregations is slowly shifting as it has shifted in the outside world. But the long stalemate, punctuated by vicious little skirmishes, can only be expected to continue.</p> <p>There is the slow international fissioning of the Anglican communion, where conservative Africans and Asians have been trying for years to throw out the more liberal churches of North America, with the Church of England caught uneasily between factions. It's difficult to see any compromise there except the peace of exhaustion.</p> <p>With all these difficulties at home and abroad it's lucky that the Crown Nominations Commission believe in prayer, since prayer will work at least as well as horsetrading when it meets next week to choose its victim.</p>",
  "<p><strong>What inspired you to write this parallel Moby-Dick?</strong></p> <p>A silly joke. The joke of Moby-Dick, except with moles instead of whales. I thought of that, and it made me laugh. Of course there's nothing new about retelling Moby-Dick with other beasts - there have been dragon Moby-Dicks, dust monster Moby-Dicks, flying monster Moby-Dicks, etc etc. I liked the idea of the mole, though, because moles are such lovely and - in my head - adorable animals, and the necessary translation or mistranslation of them into what I wanted - enormous, astounding, epic terrors - was a big ask, which I thought might be enjoyable. For me, though, though I don't mind pegging a story on a joke, having decided to write it, I want to treat it as seriously as possible, So while I hope there are genuinely funny bits in the book, I didn't want to make the whole thing just a gag, I wanted to quickly forget how absurd the idea was - though it is absurd and that was part of the whole point - and start to treat it as if it was epic. That's a game I enjoy. I also didn't want to write something that was just a parallel - I know some people like them, but I don't overmuch enjoy stories that exactly point-for-point retell other stories. So I knew I wanted Moby-Dick to be a peg, an inspiration, a riff, an echo, but for my story to wander off and do very different things. (Visiting Robert Louis Stevenson, Daniel Defoe, Joan Aiken, and lots of other writers on the way.)</p> <p><strong>Which character from Railsea do you identify most with?</strong></p> <p>The one I would most like to be like is Caldera. The one I fear I am most like is Sham at the start. </p> <p><strong>If you could be trapped on a desert island in the middle of the Railsea, with any of the characters, who would you choose and why? Personally, I would choose to be trapped with the twins, Caldera and Caldero, because they are resourceful and determined, while are also likely to be able to fashion together some sort of craft out of salvage, using the skills their parents taught them, allowing us to escape.</strong></p> <p>I think your answer is very persuasive. For overlapping reasons, I would probably choose Sirocco. She is not as admirable or as inventive as the Shroakes, but I like her swagger, and I think she would be entertainingly foul-mouthed if annoyed.</p> <p><strong>On p8 of Railsea you write, \"Lights winked in her bulky, composite left arm. It's metal &amp; ivory clicked &amp; twitched\". Was Railsea influenced by the steampunk movement and was it your intention to appeal to a steampunk audience or was it merely coincidence?</strong></p> <p>I'm sure the book was influenced by steampunk, but at least at a conscious level I wanted it very much not to be a steampunk book. It is no coincidence that the train itself is not a steam train. That there are electric trains, hand-powered trains, and so on, as well as the now culturally ubiquitous steam-engines. I wanted it to be a world in which there was more of a patchwork of technology than a Victorian-era level of technology, even a fantasticated and imaginary one. I like to think of this as a salvagepunk book, rather than a steampunk one. </p> <p><strong>In Railsea, on page 143, you explore \"&amp;\", and its relationship with the Railsea itself. What inspired you to include this? Why did you wait until Chapter 33 to explain why you used the symbol &amp; instead of the word \"and\"?</strong></p> <p>I love ampersands, which is the utterly beautiful name for those utterly beautiful \"&amp;\" signs, and I always have. I love their sweep and height, I love that such a tiny word has such a splendidly rococo alternative, I like everything about them. In addition, I associate them with 18th century maritime narratives - in my mind, ships logs from that time use them in big ink swirls - which I wanted my story to echo off, so it seemed a perfect excuse to use them. I put the \"explanation\" in later, rather than earlier, because I sort of vaguely felt like I knew it might annoy some readers to use the &amp; all the way through, and that to jump in too quickly with an explanation might feel a bit like I was saying \"Look! It's ok! I have a reason! Don't go away!\" which felt a little bit cowardly. I'd rather keep people interested, if I can, even despite their eyes twitching a little at the &amp;-signs (which not everyone's does, of course, some people love them or don't care), and then have an explanation when they've already surrendered to the ampersand. </p> <p><strong>On a recent visit to a 16th century house called East Riddlesdon Hall, I found an early Victorian child's sampler that used the ampersand (&amp;) as a full stop. Have you ever come across this before and do you have any idea why they might have done this?</strong></p> <p>I have never heard of this, and I am quite fascinated. And troubled: my typographical philosophy is being shaken. </p> <p><strong>Within Un Lun Dun, you acknowledge the fact that Neil Gaiman's book, Neverwhere gave you \"indispensable contributions to London's phantasmagoria\". Are there any other specific books \"indispensable\" to the writing of both Un Lun Dun and Railsea?</strong></p> <p>So very many I don't know where to start. Lewis Carroll's Alice books, Joan Aiken's books, especially The Wolves of Willoughby Chase and The Whispering Mountain, Alan Garner's astonishing books, Michael de Larrabeiti's Borrible trilogy, Ivor Cutler and Helen Oxenbury's Meal One, Norton Juster's Phantom Tollbooth, Enid Blyton's Faraway Tree books (for all that they make me wince, now), Else Holmelund Minarik's A Kiss for Little Bear (with Sendak's illustrations), the books of Jan Pienkowski, Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea books, Tanith Lee's Prince on a White Horse, so...</p> <p><strong>Was it your intention to write a story similar to Neverwhere, but suitable for younger children?</strong></p> <p>With Un Lun Dun? Not deliberately. I think Neverwhere stands quite outstandingly enough on its own that to write a \"version\" of it would be disastrous! I started writing Un Lun Dun before I'd actually read Neverwhere, but when I did read it I realised of course there were strong echoes. I see echoes with lots of books in all my books, some deliberate, some unconscious until later, and as long as that is respectful I think that's great - writing on the shoulders of other writers is a privilege. </p> <p><strong>Did you severely alter your writing style to make your work appeal to children?</strong></p> <p>Not exactly. Every book I write, the first thing I have to do is get into the voice, and the voice varies from book to book - that's part of what's interesting to me. So the voices between, say, Kraken and Embassytown (two of my \"adult\" books) I think varies considerably, and similarly the voice between Un Lun Dun and Railsea. Of course, who you're writing for is part of the decision about the voice of the book, so to that extent, yes, sort of - but the person you're writing for is (sorry to repeat what is a cliche, but it's true) yourself - though yourself at different times and in different moods. So when I wrote Railsea, I was very much wanting to write a story for myself at a certain age. I tried to inhabit the voice that would excite and win over and appeal to and interest that me, rather than thinking \"now to write to appeal to children\". I wouldn't know how - but I do know how to tell younger-me a story he would like, I think and hope. </p> <p><strong>After seeing children's initial response's to Un Lun Dun, did you change your writing style in any other ways when it came to writing Railsea?</strong></p> <p>I'm sure I changed my style - I mean, I think the two books have very different voices - but not in terms of thinking \"this is what readers/children/anyone wants\". I think I would be very bad at second-guessing that, and honestly it's not something I'm wildly excited about or interested in doing. I'm much more interested in writing in a voice that excites me and trying to do it in a way that I can win people over. To that extent - and I'm repeating something I've said before, for which apologies, but occasionally a line comes out of your mouth that is useful enough that you end up recycling it - I don't think my job is to try to give readers what they want; I think my job is to try to make readers want what I give. </p> <p>Of course, I may fail! </p> <p><strong>You seem to have a specific interest in the damage we are doing to the environment and how it is affecting us. (The Smog, Upsky, and the origins of the Railsea). Why is this?</strong></p> <p>Well, the interest is simply that such degradation and despoliation is enormously worrying. There is also something awesome - awful, but awesome - awe-ful - about those ruined landscapes. There is something both dreadful but also compelling about those visions. I don't think I'm alone in this - lots of cultural bits and pieces, while they're sincerely concerned about pollution, say, are also endlessly fascinated with depicting it in amazing, even beautiful ways. Culture often has it both ways like that. All of which said, I think in the context of a story, I'm happy to use these ideas for texture, to give me, and hopefully some readers something to chew on, but they aren't intended to be tracts making political arguments. That wouldn't work. The Smog in Un Lun Dun obviously has something to do, yes, with environmental issues, but within the story, above and beyond all that, it has to be an enjoyable, scary monster. </p> <p><strong>Is it the role of all science fiction writers to be prophetic like HG Wells?</strong></p> <p>I think science fiction is very bad at prediction. That doesn't mean no ideas from SF ever end up, in some complicated, half-accurate, circuitous way finding some kind of reality in the world. Obviously, sometimes that does happen. But far, far, far more of the ideas of SF never turn real, and the ones that do often do so in very misleading ways. None of this is a criticism! I know some people think it is the role of SF to be prophetic: I don't. I think the role of science fiction is not at all to prophecy. I think it is to tell interesting, vivid, strange stories that at their best are dreamlike intense versions and visions of today. </p> <p><strong>You seem to have a fascination with subverting creatures usually considered innocent and harmless into deadly beasts. Is this to try and control and manipulate your readers, taking them out of their comfort zone?</strong></p> <p>Personally, as I was so immersed in the story, it did not initially strike me as odd within the context of the story. I suppose possibly to some extent, but in an ideal world you'd hope you're pushing readers enjoyably out of comfort zones with all sorts of things, not only with the animals. But as one component of that? Certainly! It's also, as I mentioned before, an enjoyment in jokes. Nothing more sophisticated than trying to make something incredibly adorable and cute really scary and either evil or terrifying or both. And, I suppose, there's nothing to preclude vice versa. Perhaps a cuddly pet shark or something might crop up. </p> <p><strong>You also seem to have an interest in the mammoth and the gigantic. Is there a specific reason for this?</strong></p> <p>Doubtless. But I'm often the last to know the reasons behind My Things. In this case, there's something about disobedient scale which is endlessly intoxicating. Not only to me, of course - it's a common bit of brain candy. But it's one to which I am indeed thoroughly addicted. Something about making the normal strange, I think. Tentatively. </p> <p> <br><em><strong>Can we please note, just in case anyone is reading this who might want to come innocent to the books, that the following question contains mild SPOILERS! </strong></em></p> <p><strong>Both Railsea and Un Lun Dun come to satisfying conclusions (eg the happy ever after scenario). Do you plan to continue this approach in future children's books?</strong></p> <p>It would entirely depend on the book. It's certainly not something about which I have a principle in general. I do tend to feel happy and to be enjoying myself when I'm writing books with younger readers - with my younger self - in mind, so maybe that's why, but I'd like to reserve the right to write something thoroughly miserable in that vein, too. Not that I'm in a hurry to, but you never know.</p> <p><strong>Are you ever tempted to end with a cliffhanger or kill off the hero/heroine?</strong></p> <p>Cliffhangers, no. (Though some of my other books some people think end in that unresolved manner. I don't - I think they always reach a resolution, but I can accept there's a reasonable disagreement about it.) The death of a heroine or hero? Certainly, if I felt like it was appropriate for the book. Awful things have happened to some of my protagonists in some of my other books, and might do again. I am terrible at sad films, but I don't dislike sad books in the same way. </p> <p><strong>Who are Indigo and Oscar, the people you have dedicated your children's books to?</strong></p> <p>You are the first person ever to ask me that. Kudos. Indigo is my niece, my sister's daughter. Oscar is the son of a very good friend of mine. </p> <p><strong>Can you tell us what are you working on next?</strong></p> <p>Some short stories, a long novel, some non-fiction, bit of this, bit of that. I know that's really vague, and I apologise if I'm being annoying. I don't mean to be coy - I just get very superstitious about talking about work in progress. It feels like a dreadful hostage to fortune to announce it to the universe while it is still in the process of being formed. It feels like the universe will punish me - and the writing - for my presumption. So I'd rather stay a bit schtum. </p> <p><strong>Are there any plans for an Un Lun Dun film in the near future?</strong></p> <p>We have had some conversations with film-makers at various points, and some people have been excited about the idea, but nothing concrete. I would be happy if something interesting came along, and I'm very open-minded, but I think setting your hopes on film stuff is a good and efficient way to make yourself go crazy, so I attempt to opt out of such aspirations. One day, perhaps, but I wouldn't hold your breath. </p> <p><strong>Lastly I have a suggestion for you, why not write a short story about what the Olympics would be like in Un Lun Dun?</strong></p> <p>This is a startling and excellent idea. Immediately various sporting events are suggesting themselves to me. I am grateful to you for the suggestion. I do ruminate on a return to Deeba and Zanna one day, so who knows?<br> <strong>Thank you so much! </strong></p>",
  "<p>If Angela Merkel wins next year's elections, she will become Germany's second-longest-serving postwar chancellor after Helmut Kohl \u2013 and be heading towards becoming Europe's longest-serving female head of government, eclipsing Margaret Thatcher.</p> <p>Such a political triumph is not about to get any easier. Merkel could yet fall foul of the euroszone turmoil. And then there is also the fact that Germany's political landscape has become more fragmented than at any time since the end of the second world war.</p> <p>\"Germany is not becoming ungovernable, but it's definitely becoming harder to form governments,\" said Hans Kundnani, a Germany analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations.</p> <p>Five to six parties have been competing for seats in the Bundestag since East and West Germany were reunited in 1990, including the Christian Democrats; their Bavarian sister party, the CSU; the pro-business FDP; the Greens; and the PDS or Party of Democratic Socialism \u2013 later to become Die Linke, (the Left). Next year, a new force will try to join the mix, an upstart party called the Pirates, which has made striking gains in four state elections so far.</p> <p>The Freie W\u00e4hler, (free voters), a campaign group of Eurosceptic, anti-bailout campaigners is also trying to establish itself and while it has yet to enjoy the sort of poll successes of the Pirates, it is being tipped as a future player on the political scene, particularly if anti-European sentiment increases.</p> <p>\"There is a very considerable potential for dissatisfaction in Germany right now,\" said Gunnar Beck, a German reader in EU law at the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas), University of London.</p> <p>The quiet revolution in German politics is being prepared in a small office space in Berlin's Mitte district, where the Pirates' head, Bernd Schl\u00f6mer, a criminologist by training, sits at a table surrounded by crates of Club-Mate energy drinks and shelves of computer equipment.</p> <p>\"There is a mood change taking place in Germany,\" he said. \"The other parties are suffering from the fact that they are not seen as innovative forces and we're benefiting from that.\"</p> <p>Germans, he said, want to be \"far more involved\" in the decision-making process. Though he admitted the difficulty faced by his party, whose main campaign issue is to push for more internet freedom, of \"trying to develop a political style from nothing\".</p> <p>He said it is unfair to criticise the party for its vague stance on major issues. It is developing them, he said, arguing that other more established parties are often no clearer.</p> <p>\"We have no answers to the euro crisis, but neither do the other parties.\"</p> <p>Yet just as his party is benefiting from the crisis drawing in an anti-establishment crowd, so the crisis should be seen as an opportunity.</p> <p>\"We should use the crisis to redefine Europe, to redefine Germany's political landscape. This crisis is a chance,\" he said, adding something you do not expect to hear from the mouth of a politician. \"My party's greatest ambition would be to become obsolete because everyone else copied us.\"</p> <p>The question is whether the party will be strong enough to change the system or whether, as many analysts rather suspect, it will become subsumed by it.</p> <p>\"The more the Pirates are involved in the parliamentary process, the more they'll have to play within the rules,\" said Gerd Languth, professor of political science at the University of Bonn. \"It cannot be ruled out that they'll enter the Bundestag, but there's still quite a lot of doubt.\"</p> <p>While the three-party traffic-light coalition (Greens, Liberals, SPD) is a possibility, or even a minority government, most experts predict a return to the grand coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats last seen in 2005. While at the outset it can seem unwieldy, general consensus seems to be that it can work more effectively in challenging times.</p> <p>While branding German voters highly traditionalist, and preferring to vote for a party rather than a personality, Languth, said that Merkel's own personality ratings had been so consistently high that \"it's hard to imagine that the Merkel factor won't play a role\" in the election outcome.</p> <p>He said there was no sign that Germany was in danger of becoming ungovernable. \"Because Germany's system is representative that means that six or more parties can still get into the Bundestag, which in theory might lead to a lack of stability, but it is also Germany's democratic advantage, above, say, Great Britain.\"</p> <p>The German system is also supported by the high degree to which Germans desire political consensus, he added. \"It's amazing how consensus-oriented the Germans are, in part due to the collective trauma of the 1920s and 30s. Add to that the fact they're also overwhelmingly pro-European and that simply increases the sense of consensus, which say, is greater than the will to topple Merkel.\"</p> <p>Many are fearful though of that consensus and its potentially stultifying consequences. The leftwing political commentator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/21/angela-merkel-hamburg-christian-democrats-germany\" title=\"\">Jakob Augstein</a> has said a Grand Coalition between the CDU and SPD would cause a \"German paralysis\".</p> <p>\"A Grand Coalition is not a symbol of our democracy but of a long and lingering illness ... It would feel like Germans had given up on their political system ... It amounts to a resignation. A silence,\" he recently commented.</p> <p>Kundnani said that what's happened in Germany is merely a reflection on what's happened elsewhere. \"Politics has become less tribal,\" he said. In other words, people are no longer voting for the same party for life and your party affiliations no longer determine the job you do.</p> <p>\"The big game-changer was the arrival of Die Linke, as a belated consequence of German unification, which led to the fragmentation of German politics and make it harder to have a two-party coalition,\" he said. \"When the Grand Coalition was formed in 2005 it was the only option left \u2013 largely because the Linke had eaten into the SPD vote so much that they could no longer head a government. Many said that there would be no more two-party coalitions, but it seems we're back to that situation.\"</p> <p>Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, a senior transatlantic fellow with the <a href=\"http://www.gmfus.org/\" title=\"\">German Marshall Fund</a> in Berlin, said she did not believe a Grand Coalition would be damaging to Germany: \"Though we know from experience it could be boring and painful, and that boredom and pain will be more or less depending on who the challenger is.\" Despite their current poor standing in the polls, neither would she exclude, she said, the scenario of a Social Democrat chancellor in the event of an economic downturn.</p> <p>What makes Germany complicated to govern is the federal parliamentary democracy structure put in place by the allies after the second world war \u2013 consisting of the two-chamber legislature, the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, plus the constitutional court that in effect polices it \u2013 which aimed to make the political landscape as inclusive as possible, said Wolfgang Nowak, director of Deutsche Bank's <a href=\"http://www.alfred-herrhausen-gesellschaft.de/en/\" title=\"\">Alfred Herrhausen Society</a> and a former adviser to the Social Democrat chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der.</p> <p>\"The German system works on the basis that it's better to have the opposition in parliament than on the street,\" he said. \"Whether that makes sense or not is another question, but what we have is a very complex electoral system which tries to bind all currents into one parliament. The executive in Germany is very, very tightly controlled. Is Germany weakened by that? Yes, of course. But is Britain stronger with a two-party government?\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15737185\" title=\"\">David McAllister</a>, the CDU prime minister of Lower Saxony, said stability was a relative concept. \"If you look at other countries with a proportional representation system, the German political system has been very stable over the last 65 to 70 years. Compare it to Italy, where political parties like the Christian Democrats have completely disappeared, or you look at the Netherlands or Denmark, it's quite clear that Germany has quite a stable system. And I'm not sure we will have a six-party system in the long term \u2013 the Linke seem to have reached their peak, and the Pirates? Well, they just have to grow up and start working on their programme if they want to have a chance but in the meantime they've taught us that we've got to explain more about what we're doing at all stages of the political process.\"</p>",
  "<p>We know how challenging the role of a frontline children's social worker is. We also know that social workers have an enormous impact on the lives of children and young people \u2013 often a life changing one.</p> <p>In 2010, a regional survey showed that while Central Bedfordshire had the lowest profile in the region among social workers \u2013 despite being the largest unitary authority \u2013 we topped the job satisfaction league for people who already work here. The question then was, how could we get the message out to others that this is a great place to live and work?</p> <p>No one could disagree that employing qualified, committed and enthusiastic staff is a sound investment. So this year we commissioned HR company <a href=\"http://www.penna.com/\" title=\"\">Penna</a> to work with us on a campaign to reach out to social workers and the concept of \"love your job again\" was born.</p> <p>The campaign is primarily <a href=\"http://www.loveyourjobagain.com/\" title=\"\">internet based</a> and features unscripted videos with three of our staff and also lots of supportive quotes from other employees about why they enjoy working here. We are also placing adverts in the trade press, which reflect the look and feel of the website.</p> <p>The majority of social workers do love their work, but recent high profile cases and the perceived level of red tape and target setting has certainly had an effect on both their professional and personal lives. The campaign has encouraged us to emphasise what social workers do best and to build on the recommendations of the <a href=\"http://www.safeguardingchildrenea.co.uk/summary_and_download_of_final_munro_report\" title=\"\">Munro report on child protection</a>.</p> <p>We focused on those things which made our social workers choose the career in the first place: wanting to make a difference, helping children to stay safe and the chance to reach their professional potential. We used current staff to get the message across that our children's services teams are friendly and supportive and that there's always someone around to talk things through with.</p> <p>We also realised that in addition to an open, honest environment, it's essential to offer career progression and training. Our newly qualified staff tell us they are well supported with excellent training opportunities, delivered by nationally recognised trainers.</p> <p>You rarely see a news story about good social work and we know we won't read about good decisions our social workers have made, or how they have gone above and beyond to make a difference. So we work hard to ensure that staff are recognised for their dedication in house.</p> <p>To date the campaign has been positive; we've had a good response and recruited some great new people. But we're still on the lookout for more, especially experienced social workers looking for a new challenge. We have shown that we can help our staff \"love their job again\".</p> <p><em>Yolanda Corden is interim assistant director of operations for children's services at </em><a href=\"http://www.centralbedfordshire.gov.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Central Bedfordshire council</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and the latest jobs direct to you</strong></p>"
