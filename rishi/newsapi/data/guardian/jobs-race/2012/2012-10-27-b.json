  "<p>I'd have been sceptical if someone had told me five years ago, when I first started work on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/25/david-adjaye-tops-powerlist-2013\" title=\"\">Powerlist: Britain's Most Influential Black People</a>, that three of our launches would be attended by the prime minister of the day (Gordon Brown twice and David Cameron last Thursday). More so, to be told that it would lead to the setting up of a charity, the trustees of which are some of the country's leading lights in their respective fields.</p> <p>But it has done all that and more and seems to have taken on a life of its own now. When we launched in 2008, the initial idea was to showcase how success for black Britons was not confined to sport and entertainment. We wanted black kids to look up to other people \u2013 in the professions and beyond.</p> <p>As the prime minister writes in this year's Powerlist: \"We should never underestimate the power of role models. When teenagers see high achievers who look like them, who have reached the top in law, business, politics, they're going to think, 'I can do that; I can go far too.'\" It's why we send thousands of copies, most paid for by the people on the list, to schools.</p> <p>We are also keen that people of other ethnicities are also made aware of the list. Most racism is born of ignorance and a lack of respect. Challenging negative stereotypes can change perceptions. To survive, the Powerlist has to be dynamic and over the years we have unearthed more and more great people.</p> <p>In 2008, Dr Mo Ibrahim, the billionaire philanthropist, topped the list when most people had never heard of him. Baroness Scotland, the then attorney general, headed it the following year and she was succeeded, for two years running, by Tidjane Thiam, the CEO of Prudential. This year, David Adjaye, whom President Obama refers to as his favourite architect, is at number one on the list, selected by a panel of independent judges working from a definition of influence as \"the ability to alter events and change lives in a positive way\".</p> <p>His top position is particularly significant because Adjaye is essentially a builder and the Powerlist Foundation, the aforementioned charity, is planning to build a free school that will open in 2015. It will be an A-level college, with a particular focus on leadership, located in inner London. Its intake will be children from disadvantaged backgrounds who have leadership potential that may otherwise go untapped. Our mission is to give them a boost in line with our motto: \"Sharing success with tomorrow's leaders\".</p> <p>The future? We've already launched a publication called <em>Future Leaders</em>, which profiles the best black university students and next year we'll put out a publication about women, which the charity will follow up with a leadership programme for young women at university. It'll be interesting to see where we are in another five years.</p> <p><em>Michael Eboda is the founder and chief executive of Powerful Media Ltd. The Powerlist and <em>Future Leaders</em> are available to purchase online at </em><a href=\"http://www.powerful-media.com/\" title=\"\"><em>www.powerful-media.com</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 November 2012 to clarify links to Powerful Media Ltd and its publication <em>Future Leaders</em>.</p>",
  "<p>Those of us who worry about the old media have had a fraught week \u2013 and we're used to stress. The last few days have been up there with those anxious months in the 1480s when the bottom fell out of illuminated manuscripts. They've seen the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2012/oct/22/bbc-ceefax\" title=\"\">demise of Ceefax</a> \u2013 probably the most recent of all the old media, a brand spanking new old medium, hardly conceived before it was careering towards obsolescence. Useful, if clunky \u2013 like a seatbelt but it didn't save lives \u2013 this valiant example of British innovation will be sadly missed and reminds us that not everything that came out of the BBC in the 1970s is tinged with rape.</p> <p>Worse than that, the most powerful journalist in the world has quit. It emerged last week that Clark Kent, aka Superman, is to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2012/oct/24/supermans-clark-kent-quits-job-video\" title=\"\">leave his reporting job</a> in the forthcoming issue of the comic. Initially I assumed he was protesting against all the nasty commenters on the <em>Daily Planet</em> website: the thousands calling him an arsehole without having paid for the paper, or complaining that he only got to save the world because of his posh upbringing on Krypton. But apparently not: as well as his other powers, Superman is super-thick-skinned and embraces the internet age. He's off to work in new media and, according to Scott Lobdell, the writer of the series, is \"likely to start the next <em>Huffington Post</em>\".</p> <p>Presumably Kent originally chose to work in the print media in order to be at the beating heart of news, so he'd find out about impending world crises and sport before his fellow citizens and would consequently be best placed to save their lives. But, as the under-resourced <em>Daily Planet</em> came increasingly to rely on stories cobbled together from Twitter, the giving out of free DVDs and endless pages of comment, Kent's disillusionment must have grown. The last straw was a disagreement with proprietor Morgan Edge over his preference for celebrity gossip over hard news. Apparently they'd also just given some comedian a column.</p> <p>Superman will be all right, of course. If his internet start-up founders, he could reboot his career on <em>Dancing with the Stars</em>. But, in an era of crumbling institutions, where will the fictional heroes they once sheltered end up? What hovels will they fashion for themselves in the entrepreneurial rubble?</p> <h2><strong>Jimmy Olsen becomes a pap</strong><br></h2> <p>The <em>Daily Planet</em>'s keen young photojournalist has long since noticed which way the technological wind is blowing and gone freelance. With his digital camera and close working relationship with Superman, he can sell pictures of world disasters to the highest bidder. \"No sooner has Superman heard that there's a bus about to fall off a suspension bridge than we're there: Superman rescues the bus while I see if I can get up-the-skirt shots of the flustered passengers. People really lose their sense of modesty when they think they're about to die. I can have the shots online before Mr S has repaired the bridge with his laser eyes.\"</p> <h2><strong>Dr Watson sets up a reflexology clinic</strong><br></h2> <p>Disillusioned with the NHS, Watson has been searching out a better way to spend his time during Holmes's frequent cocaine binges. \"Medicine is a mug's game,\" is his diagnosis. \"People resent what you earn and sue if you accidentally kill them. Worse than that, you're constantly having to meet diseased people and deal with the insoluble problem of their mortality. Far better to earn my crust sympathising with affluent malingerers. After all, alternative medicine does a hell of a lot of good for those who don't happen to be ill. Also, in my Harley Street clinic, I get to meet the kind of rich person who's likely to be involved in an interesting murder.\"</p> <h2><strong>Mr Chips says goodbye early</strong><br></h2> <p>In the latest reimagining of the tale of Mr Chipping, the noble and dogged public schoolmaster who inspired generations of schoolboys with his principles and erudition, Chips leaves Brookfield in disgust when the prime minister, an old Brookfieldian, slashes spending on libraries and the arts. \"You can't spend your life worrying about whether or not children know Latin,\" he concludes. \"You've got to follow your dream!\" In this case, a gay dance reimagining of the <em>Satyricon</em> which he's staging above a pub in&#xa0;Wandsworth.</p> <h2><strong>Rumpole of the Bailey makes sideways move into corporate law</strong><br></h2> <p>With legal aid now capped at the bus fare for a trainee solicitor to come and explain how to plead guilty, Rumpole desperately needed a more remunerative outlet for his legal knowledge. Inspired by an old university friend who makes an excellent living concocting legal challenges to anything nasty that gets printed about Jeffrey Archer, Horace decided he'd had enough of criminal law and is now doing a roaring trade defending chemical conglomerates against class actions from the various poor people they've maimed.</p> <h2><strong>Inspector Morse takes the plunge into app design</strong><br></h2> <p>In ITV's latest remake, following the success of <em>Lewis</em>, <em>Endeavour</em>, <em>Morse at School</em>, <em>Morsel</em> (the Inspector's Infant Cases), <em>Space Morse</em> and <em>What If Morse Was In The Sweeney But He Wasn't Regan He Was Still Morse?</em>, comes <em>Morse Code</em>, a brand new quality drama in which Morse didn't die but just went into hiding and had plastic surgery to look like Robson Green. Increasingly disillusioned with the police force post-Hillsborough, Morse does an IT course, moves to the Isle of Skye and tries to make a living designing cryptic-crossword- and real-ale-based smartphone apps.</p> <h2><strong>Mary Poppins works in PR</strong><br></h2> <p>Preferring to leave the tedium of caring for other people's children to those who are trying to obtain residency rights, the former magical nanny is forging a very successful career since founding Practically Perfect PR. \"There are two types of PR company,\" she explains. \"Those who tell people about events, movies, shows and products that are already very popular and don't really need PR, and those who fail to tell them about those that aren't and do. The trick is to be in the former camp.\"</p> <h2><strong>Jeeves is now an accountancy whiz</strong><br></h2> <p>The news that Bertie Wooster has enrolled at film school so horrifies Jeeves that he puts his days in service behind him. Far from a revolutionary though, he finds another way of shoring up the status quo by optimising the tax arrangements of his former employer and other members of the Drones. So brilliant is the ex-valet's interpretation of tax law that the British taxpayer accidentally ends up owing Bertie the entire GDP of China.</p> <p><em>David Mitchell's autobiography, </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/tvandradio/9780007351725/david-mitchell-back-story\" title=\"\"><em>Back&#xa0;Story,</em></a><em> is out now</em></p>",
  "<p>Angela Shaw does not believe it, but she is in the frontline of a war. The 42-year-old Florida lawyer is in a crucial swing state and thus represents what is emerging as a decisive factor in America's 2012 election \u2013 the female voters set to determine the race for the White House.</p> <p>As the bitter contest enters its final week, President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney are neck-and-neck and their campaigners are now doing everything they can to persuade voters that their party would best serve women's interests.</p> <p>Television ads appeal directly to them; at campaign stops both Obama and Romney speak about them; and surrogates from Bill Clinton to Cindy McCain are wheeled out to tout for their support. Yet Obama has seen a strong lead among women almost disappear, making it feasible that they might vote on 6 November to put a Republican back in the Oval Office.</p> <p>That is certainly what Shaw wants to see. \"I think Obama has been an abysmal failure. He's done nothing for people like me,\" she said at a campaign stop in the central Florida town of Winter Park, where Romney's spouse, Ann, was holding a rally. Shaw said she had been largely out of work for the last four years, as had her husband, an estate agent. That, she said, was more than enough to make her want Obama to lose. \"If Romney wins, I think there will be an economic uptick. It would be not be overnight, but the economy will be finally moving forward,\" she said.</p> <p>That sort of sentiment is a nightmare to the Obama team. For months the Democrats have enjoyed a huge lead among women. It helped them weather much of Romney's rise after Obama's disastrous performance in the first presidential debate.</p> <p>Now there are signs that this usually solid bulwark of support is crumbling. A poll last week from AP-GfK had Obama and Romney level among women at 47 points each. Only a month ago the same survey had Obama ahead by 16 points. The average of the overall national polls has Romney edging into a two-point lead. \"Obama must do very well with women voters or not get a second term,\" said Professor Robert Watson, an expert in American studies at Lynn University in Florida.</p> <p>Some experts believe the Democrats have made a strategic mistake. Over the summer the Obama campaign leaped on a series of gaffes by Republican politicians and conservative commentators, such as radio host Rush Limbaugh, on abortion, rape and reproductive rights.</p> <p>Democrats touted a \"Republican war on women\" as one of the main planks of their campaign and seemed destined to tighten their hold on the female vote. But now it seems that a simple fact has been overlooked: in a struggling economy, women voters will put concern over jobs first. One study showed that, of the 2.6m jobs created since the recession ended, 80% have gone to men. \"The Democrats played up social issues and thought they were going to coast to victory,\" said Katherine Jellison, a history professor at Ohio University. \"Now Democrats have to spin the social issues back to the economy.\"</p> <p>Yet that territory is one the Republicans have been owning for months. Romney and his running mate, the firebrand Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan, have hammered home their argument that Obama has failed to stimulate the economy or significantly reduce the suffering of those hit by joblessness. The AP poll, for example, showed 51% thought Romney would do a better job of managing the economy, compared with 44% for Obama.</p> <p>That was the message Ann Romney was pumping out in Winter Park. Though the town, near Orlando, is one of the most upmarket in the state, with its leafy streets lined with expensive bistros, the image Romney painted was of an America on the brink of collapse.</p> <p>\"Like you, we have friends and neighbours that are suffering in this economy,\" she told the predominantly female crowd. \"We're going to get it right this time, and we're going to make sure in November that we make Mitt Romney the next president of the United States.\"</p> <p>Of course, the Obama campaign is far from dead. His team still expects to win, both with women voters and overall. Speaking to journalists last week, Obama's top political adviser, David Axelrod, was full of confident bluster, even offering a $10,000 bet to reporters that Romney could not explain how he plans to balance the ballooning deficit. \"We feel strongly that we have the winning hand,\" he said. \"Governor Romney will take us back to the foreign policy of the 1980s, the social policy of the 1950s and the economic policy of the 1920s.\"</p> <p>That sort of language works with some women, warning of a reversal of social rights, such as abortion, that have been hard won. \"Those issues are very important to me,\" said Mary Faso, 61, an academic at Broward College in Davie, Florida, where Michelle Obama was speaking. \"It matters a lot to me and to a lot of the young people here. Romney on these matters is scary.\"</p> <p>Faso was in a crowd of 2,000 who had packed into a sports hall to listen to the first lady. The audience full of women listened intently as she warned of the dire consequences of a Romney win and listed her husband's achievements. \"When it comes to understanding the lives of women, when it comes to standing up for our rights and opportunities, we know my husband will always have our backs.\"</p> <p>There has been a clear distinction between the camps. During the Democrats' convention in North Carolina \u2013 a swing state that many experts think is likely to fall to Romney \u2013 the party touted its passing of the Lilly Ledbetter law, which helps get equal pay for women. Obama and his supporters also sell his healthcare reforms as a way of helping women.</p> <p>But neither that, nor the Republicans' repeated gaffes over rape and abortion, have halted the Romney rise in the last three weeks. In a swath of swing states, from Colorado, to New Hampshire, the polls have narrowed dramatically. Most of them are evenly split with barely a glimmer of daylight between the candidates. \"It is very close. That is why the fight over the female vote has now become so important,\" said Professor Bruce Gronbeck, a political scientist at the University of Iowa.</p> <p>Most people expect ground zero of the election to be Ohio. No Republican candidate has won the White House without achieving victory in that midwestern state that combines a stretch of \"rust belt\" along its northern coast, rural farmland around the capital Columbus and a heavily Republican southern border with Kentucky. If Obama can stop Romney in Ohio, so the Democrat argument goes, then the Romney advance will be blocked and Obama will win re-election. The latest polls there vary from calling the race a tie to having Obama up by five points.</p> <p>For the moment, that is grounds for Axelrod to keep expressing his confidence. \"This race has settled into exactly where we thought we would be. It is the race we prepared for,\" he said. \"We will know who is bluffing and who isn't [on election day] and I'm looking forward to it.\"</p> <p>Such bravado is increasingly rare on both sides as attitudes across America harden and the still undecided voters become harder to find. One such is Daniel Snow, a 28-year-old estate agent who moved from Romney's home state of Massachusetts to Florida a year ago. He voted for Obama in 2008 but now is unsure whom he will back. He was not a fan of Romney's period in charge of Massachusetts but nor does he feel Obama has fulfilled his potential.</p> <p>\"I voted for Obama four years ago. I don't regret my decision, but I did not see the change that I thought I would,\" he said, explaining he had come to see Michelle Obama speak in Davie to \"get some more information\" that would help him make a choice. Snow was a rare male figure at the event; as the election hits the closing stages, it is women who are centre stage.</p> <p>Commentators and statisticians have tried to come up with a term for them this year. They have been dubbed \"waitress moms\" or \"Walmart moms\" who are not college-educated and earn relatively low wages. Each side has devoted much attention to getting its women supporters to the polls. \"All this hard work and progress: it's all on the line, it's all at stake this November,\" said Michelle Obama in Davie. Meanwhile, in Winter Park, Ann Romney was busy thanking the hundreds of women who turned out to express their support. Standing under a Women for Mitt banner, she boasted of her 18 grandchildren and told the overwhelmingly female crowd: \"We need you to get out there.\"</p> <p>Yet, for all the attention now focused on them, some female voters say the equation is actually simple. They do not like being singled out as a demographic, when they represent the majority of the electorate. Nor do they appreciate such things as abortion being pitched as \"women's issues\" that will solely decide their allegiance.</p> <p>\"Obama says that Romney has a war on women. I don't agree with that,\" said Shaw. \"By saying that, he says that all women are concerned about is birth control and abortion. It demeans us. It says we don't have a brain,\" she said. Shaw says she has other, more pressing concerns when it comes to an election that is now just over a week away.</p> <p>They have nothing to do with her sex, instead reflecting the deep and abiding economic woes that still mark the American electorate. \"We haven't lost our home, but so many people I have worked with have lost everything,\" she said.</p>",
