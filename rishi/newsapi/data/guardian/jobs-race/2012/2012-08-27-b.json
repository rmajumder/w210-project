  "<p>The Federal Reserve needs to take action now to bring down the jobless rate, a top Fed official said on Monday.</p> <p>Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Federal Reserve, said the central bank should not wait for more data. \"I don't think we should be in a mode where we are waiting to see what the next few data releases bring. We are well past the threshold for additional action; we should take that action now,\" he told reporters at a seminar at the Hong Kong Bankers Club.</p> <p>Last week the Fed released minutes from its last meeting a the end of July which showed its members were increasingly concerned about the slowdown in the US's fragile economic recovery. At their previous meeting in June the minutes showed only \"a few members\" thought further stimulus would likely be needed.</p> <p>Evans said that without a change in policy, the unemployment rate, now at 8.3%, was unlikely to fall below 7% before 2015 at the earliest.</p> <p>Last year the Fed launched a securities buying programme known as Operation Twist aimed at bringing down longer-term interest rates. Evans appeared to be giving support to a similar move. \"It is time to take even stronger steps,\" he said.</p> <p>His comments come ahead of a speech Friday from Fed chairman Ben Bernanke at the Kansas City Fed's annual gathering of policymakers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. That speech will be closely watched in Washington as well as by the financial markets. The economy is central to the 2012 election cycle and any move by Bernanke could trigger a furious backlash from Republican critics.</p> <p>After its last meeting the Fed signaled it was increasingly concerned about the apparent slowdown in the US recovery. Strong jobs growth over the winter collapsed in the spring. It has since recovered but remains historically weak compared to the job growth after previous recessions.</p> <p>Next Friday the Labor Department will release non-farm payroll figures for August \u2013 the closely watched monthly survey of US employment. Last month the US added 163,000 new jobs, higher than the 100,000 gain expected by economists but not enough to bring down the unemployment rate.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee, which sets Fed policy, meets after the release of those figures on September 12 and 13. That meeting is seen by economists as the last before the election at which the Fed in likely to act.</p>",
  "<p>Last July, a post about a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/21/racism-row-novel-coals-pearls?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">\"problematic\" new book</a> came up on my Tumblr dashboard. I only paid it minimal attention \u2013 I had <a href=\"http://fuckyeah-avengers.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Avengers gifs</a> to look at, after all \u2013 but then someone else posted about it, and then another, and then another. I began to pay more attention to it.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.savethepearls.com/\" title=\"\">Revealing Eden: Save the Pearls</a> is the first in a trilogy of self-published young adult novels by Victoria Foyt, in which the world as we know has drastically changed: \"the Heat\", a mysterious global happening, has wiped out most white people (the \"Pearls\" of the title). Darker-skinned people have survived this disaster thanks to their skin's melanin; they're called \"Coals\".</p> <p>Book one follows a young Pearl, Eden, who \"loathes her white skin and accepts the oppressive opinion that it is ugly, even worthless\". She wears a \"special dark coating in order to protect it from the Heat\". In an added twist, Eden must find a mate by the time she is 18, or else she will be killed. In book two, we learn that Eden's father works in a laboratory owned by a Coal (Bramford, who Eden falls in love with), where he develops the technology to enable mankind to overcome the Heat. The \"technology\" is essentially a human-animal hybrid, and Bramford becomes the first \"man-beast\" after trialling this new technology. There's also some other stuff about a terrorist Coal group, a community of near-naked rainforest-dwellers with a prophecy and some mild bestiality, too \u2013 and this is just Book One. Hoyt has also created an accompanying website to promote the book, with <a href=\"http://www.savethepearls.com/members/jamal/\" title=\"\">individual bio pages</a> to flesh out her characters' back stories. One young Coal named Jamal (sigh) notes his bucket list thusly: \"mate, turn 24, buy a new gun, become president of the FFP, destroy all Pearls\".</p> <p>It's a lot to take in.</p> <p>Foyt is hardly the first writer to use the trope of a dystopian world in young adult fiction (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games\" title=\"\">The Hunger Games</a> is still doing brisk business) and for that matter, she is not even the first to do it with a twist on race: Malorie Blackman's largely excellent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noughts_%26_Crosses_%28novel_series%29\" title=\"\">Noughts &amp; Crosses</a> series does this, so we know it is possible to write a nuanced and smart book on such a foundation. I have read Foyt's book, and aside from the astonishingly bad prose, the thing that leaps out at you is the absence of self-awareness or acknowledgement of privilege. Foyt has gone for broad brushstrokes in her fictional world: from the names she's given her characters' \"races\": Coals and Pearls (oh, come on!) to the cure for all this racial strife: the creation of a black \"beast man\" (!), to the \"special dark coating\" \u2013 blackface by any other name \u2013 to the jungle-dwelling \"primitive\" tribespeople, she's gone about it all wrong. The book is littered with several \"uh, what?\" moments, as Foyt betrays her own personal biases. When the book's very premise is so steeped in privilege, it is impossible for it not to be offensive.</p> <p>Commentator Jay Smooth has a video called \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ti-gkJiXc\" title=\"\">How To Tell People They Sound Racist</a>\". In it, he talks about the \"what they did\" versus the \"what they are\" conversation. It's about separating intention from action. Foyt's stated intent was to portray the horrors of racism. There is nothing wrong with her intention, but there are huge issues with her execution. When you write about a fictional oppressed race of white people from the position of your present-day white privilege and do not acknowledge it, the results are messy. And that's what Revealing Eden is: incredibly messy. More importantly, when you receive notice from hundreds of people of colour saying so, you do not release a statement telling them they are wrong (\"how can you critique or damn a book if you haven't read it?\" she wrote. \"This kind of blind attack is exactly what creates racism. This book is meant to provoke the white community that has never experienced racism or been oppressed because they have been in the majority in this country\"), you listen, identify and acknowledge your mistakes \u2013 and do better next time. Most recently, the makers of the Twilight movies made sure to cast Native American actors in the roles of the Quileute Indian wolf pack, a deliberate move which avoided the whitewashing to which Hollywood often resorts.</p> <p>Back in February, Foyt <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/victoria-foyt/interracial-relationships_b_1312303.html\" title=\"\">wrote in the Huffington Post</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"What does the lack of any racial outrage or puzzlement or fervor amidst the tremendous rain of positive reviews possibly say? Conceivably, if the book had not reached the African-American community of readers, if such a category still exists, perhaps there might be some backlash. The first young African-American reader who responded to me loved the book. But then, she's the kind of free spirit who would eschew limiting herself to a single category.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Her comments remind me of Baratunde Thurston's assertion in his book, <a href=\"http://howtobeblack.me/\" title=\"\">How to Be Black</a>, that all white people need a \"Good Black Friend\" to help them through potentially problematic racial situations. Thanks to the internet, Foyt just acquired a few hundred Good Black Friends. It'd be nice if she would listen to them.</p>"
