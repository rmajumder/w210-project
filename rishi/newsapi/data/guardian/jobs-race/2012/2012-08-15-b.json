  "<p>The number of Britons out of work has fallen to its lowest level in almost a year, with the decline partly due to jobs created by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012\" title=\"\">the London Olympics</a> as well as an increase in self- and part-time employment.</p> <p>Unemployment on the internationally recognised International Labour Organisation measure fell by 46,000 in the three months to June to 2.56m, according to the Office for National Statistics, to 8%, the lowest rate since the three months to July 2011.</p> <p>The improvement in the labour market comes at a time when the economy has been stuck in recession for nine months. David Cameron's government has pinned its hopes on hiring by private companies making up for the 700,000 jobs lost as part of austerity cuts to public services.</p> <p>In London, the number of people out of work fell by 42,000, suggesting some of the improvement in the jobs market was due to the Olympic Games. The number of people claiming jobless benefits across Britain dropped by 5,900, defying City forecasts of an increase. The capital accounted for half the fall and for half the new jobs created between April and June \u2013 99,000 out of a total of 201,000 across the UK.</p> <p>This rise in employment, to 29.476m, was the biggest quarterly increase since the spring of 2010 and the highest level of employment since 2008.</p> <p>Part-time employment reached a record high of 8.07m but the number of people who are working part-time only because they cannot find a full-time job also hit a new high, of 1.42m.</p> <p>Liam Byrne, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: \"We've got to redouble our efforts to get Britain back to work \u2013 90% of the fall in unemployment was in London, long-term youth unemployment is still going through the roof and part-time work has hit an all-time high as people struggle to find a full-time job.\"</p> <p>The headline figures contrast with the gloomy outlook for the economy painted by the Bank of England. It <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/08/bank-england-growth-forecast-gold-standard\" title=\"\">forecast no growth this year</a>, while some City economists expect the economy to shrink. The fact that employment is growing while output is falling has been described as a \"genuine economic puzzle\" by the Bank of England. One explanation it advanced was that productivity had weakened, i.e. you need more employees to get the same out of them.</p> <p>Nomura economist Philip Rush said: \"The Bank is slowly recognising that more of productivity's weakness is permanent. Yet still there is widespread discussion of labour hoarding,\" he said, referring to employers keeping staff on in the hope of an upturn or to preserve skills. \"We do not understand why there is so much head scratching about this so-called 'conundrum'.\"</p> <p>Even so, many analysts expect unemployment to resume its rise in the coming months reflecting the poor state of the economy. ING economist James Knightley said: \"None of this is consistent with data showing the UK has contracted for three consecutive quarters and is [performing] at the same rates as Spain and Italy \u2013 where unemployment is moving sharply higher. Moreover, UK employment is up 656,000 since the beginning of 2010 and is up 407,000 since last summer, when the UK apparently went into recession again.\"</p> <p>Unemployment in Italy is well over 10% and is approaching 25% in Spain.</p> <p>Economists said low wage growth continued to support jobs growth, with inflation of 2.6% in July still outpacing pay rises. The ONS figures showed total pay rose by 1.6% in the three months to June from a year earlier. Regular pay, excluding bonuses, was up 1.8%.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the improvement in unemployment was hard to square with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/25/george-osborne-under-pressure-economy\" title=\"\">Britain's double-dip recession</a>.</p> <p>\"It is evident that ongoing restrained earnings growth as well as significant increases in part-time jobs and self-employment is helping to keep unemployment down.</p> <p>\" The holding of the Olympic Games appeared to provide at least a temporary boost to employment in the latest figures given the stronger performance of the London labour market.\"</p>",
  "<p>Here's Natalie Clarkson writing a blog posting headlined <a href=\"http://wannabehacks.co.uk/2012/08/14/the-joy-of-receiving-a-job-rejection-letter/\">\"The joy of job rejection in journalism\"</a>... </p> <blockquote> <p>\"This week something fairly exciting happened to me. I heard the post being pushed through the letterbox and ran down to pick it up. And there it was. A rejection letter.</p> <p>Now I know it sounds a little odd to be excited about receiving a rejection letter... But the truth is, this was the first rejection letter I have received...</p> <p>Of all the jobs I've applied for, and believe me there have been lots, this is the first where I have been told I haven't got the job \u2013 the rest have simply left me hanging.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>She adds: \"Maybe I'm being petty and it's a lot to expect newspapers to reply to everyone that applies. But how hard is it to even send an automated response saying 'unfortunately you've not been successful on this occasion.'\"</p> <p>But this isn't really a sign of these straitened times. T'was ever thus. I wrote to 32 local papers in Essex and east London asking for a start and received only one reply - also a rejection. And that was in 1963!</p> <p>So how did I get a job? Luck. Plus a headmaster desperate to find a way of getting rid of a disruptive sixth-former.</p> <p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"http://wannabehacks.co.uk/2012/08/14/the-joy-of-receiving-a-job-rejection-letter/\">WannabeHacks</a></p>"
