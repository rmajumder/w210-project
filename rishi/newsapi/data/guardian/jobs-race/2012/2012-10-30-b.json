  "<p>Tensions between domestic political imperatives and the wider European interest are in the warp and weft of the EU. No member state is immune from them. That is as true in austerity-battered Greece as, especially as an election draws near, in economically prosperous Germany. It is as true in historically pro-European countries like Ireland as in historically more sceptical ones like Britain. Most of the time, however, most EU member states manage to balance the two interests. They do so because, in spite of the eurozone crisis, they mostly recognise that their nations are better off in an effective EU than in an ineffective one. Sometimes, however, the nations get the balance wrong. British politics is in danger of blundering into such a momenton Wednesday.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/calendar/#!/calendar/Commons/MainChamber/2012/10/31/events.html\" title=\"\">Commons debate</a> on the EU's next seven-year budget ought in theory to be a constructive debate about how much money the union needs and can afford, as well as how Europe's money can be best spent and best raised. In hard economic times, these are particularly acute questions with big implications. The calls on the EU budget are many, though they are dwarfed by the eurozone crisis. The ability of member states to pay is severely constrained by their own domestic budgetary cutbacks. Demand inevitably outstrips supply. The principles that govern the options are nonetheless clear. European spending should be targeted to those who need it most and to maximising its economic stimulus potential. The countries that can afford most should make the biggest contributions.</p> <p>The British government's position on the EU budget is most certainly not beyond criticism. But it is still just about consistent with this approach. David Cameron wants the EU budget to rise only in line with inflation, not by the 5% proposed by the European commission. That is not a great prospect for the countries of eastern and southern Europe whose needs are greatest, especially as Mr Cameron brooks no challenge to Britain's large rebate. But his position is a recognition of three things: the continuing importance of the EU, the practical limits of an EU budget hike in stagnant economic times, and the need to negotiate constructively in order to reach a deal.</p> <p>None of this applies to the approach taken by the Tory party's Europhobic wing. Their proposal, which may be called as an amendment in Wednesday's debate, for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/30/eu-budget-challenging-no-10\" title=\"\">a real-terms cut</a> in the EU budget is not motivated by anything other than hostility to the EU itself. They do not want structural transfers to poorer nations or sectors. They do not want an effective EU in any way. They want an ineffective EU and they want Britain to play no part in it, anyway. The fact that the Liberal Democrats think the very opposite only adds to their keenness.</p> <p>The Labour party has now <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/leftwatch/2012/10/labour-call-for-cut-in-eu-budget-in-sign-that-they-are-ready-to-play-eurosceptic-card-against-camero.html\" title=\"\">adopted the same policy as the Tory right</a>. It claims to base itself on a more reasoned approach, stressing the need for cuts in the common agricultural policy, a reform of EU structural funds to prioritise growth and jobs, and better auditing. There is indeed a strong case for all of these things. But these goals are hard to square with a real-terms cut in the budget. They are making common cause with the enemies of Europe for the satisfaction of tweaking the government's nose. Labour has been down this route in its distant past. It did the party little credit then. It does it little credit now.</p> <p>If Labour and the Tory right combine over Europe in Wednesday's vote, worse is likely to follow. British politics, particularly in England, is gearing up for a race to the bottom over Europe, with Labour and the Tories jockeying to gain the Eurosceptic advantage. It is a far cry from <a href=\"http://www.tonyblairoffice.org/news/entry/tony-blair-calls-for-a-grand-bargain-to-rescue-europe/\" title=\"\">Tony Blair's strikingly pro-European speech</a> in Berlin this week, setting out an ambitious \"grand bargain\" to rescue Europe from its current institutional crisis. A far cry too from <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/press-releases/111/9841/uk-should-offer-up-the-rebate-to-negotiate-eu-budget-cut\" title=\"\">this week's IPPR call</a> for a trade-off between the EU budget and the UK rebate. Not everything about these contributions is entirely realistic, but they are predicated on a principled and constructive case for Europe, which Labour and Britain would abandon at their peril.</p>",
  "<p>A wind from the north swept all that murk into dark corners and shredded the tall trees: from buttercup yellow to chrysanthemum bronze, the ground is littered with beautifully decaying leaves. In the hedges, waiting for their moment, are the jewels of Halloween \u2014 the <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/black-bryony\" title=\"\">black bryony</a> berries.</p> <p>In spring, the stems of black bryony twitched like asparagus spears in the hedge and grew all summer into sprawling vines to dry like sisal after flowering; only the swags of their berries remain. From white, through orange to crimson, berries brighten with promise but are full of poison.</p> <p>Underground, the bryony tubers are fist-sized, black on the outside, yellow inside: powerful, acrid and cathartic medicine that cures a bruise, a black eye maybe.</p> <p>Underground, bryony has an older story that is all but forgotten.</p> <p>Black bryony is a \"womandrake\", the female equivalent of mandrake, whose narcotic hallucinogen trips back through centuries to the shrieking root dug from under gallows. The root of mandragora takes human form, a manikin, a puppet for the earth-magic of old Europe. Because mandrake doesn't grow along English lanes, people here looked for alternative manikins to dig up and found the bryonies. White bryony, the only British member of the gourd or cucumber family, became a substitute mandrake. Black bryony, the only British yam, became womandrake. Both plants are poisonous.</p> <p>Without taking a spade to the hedge to exhume her, I try to imagine the womandrake: a woody, yam-headed, root thing with the magical power to inhabit human form. Would I recognise her walking the lanes, waiting at the bus stop, queuing in the supermarket? Does she wear bright orange jewellery? I imagine her rooted to the earth but with a mind that travels the dark spaces of this landscape.</p>",
  "<p>London black cab maker Manganese Bronze has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers as administrators. The company reported on Tuesday that the accountants aim to find a buyer for the whole business or just for parts of it.</p> <p>Matthew Hammond, a partner with the firm, said: \"We are reviewing the existing financial position to develop a range of options to rescue the business or alternatively dispose of it to an investor that can continue the business to a secure future for the iconic London Black Cab.\"</p> <p>Discussions have already started with a number of UK and international companies. But the future of the manufacturer, which has been losing market share to Mercedes Vito taxis, does not look bright.</p> <p>Manganese Bronze has been making losses for four years due to a combination of poor UK sales, supply chain issues, and high warranty costs. Earlier this month it suspended its shares and recalled 400 taxis due to a steering box defect.

  "<p>What do you picture when you hear the words \"Mexican beggar child\"? Is the child blond? Green-eyed? Does she have light skin?</p> <p>A Mexican family was recently at the centre of a national controversy over such questions. A young Mexican girl begging for money was photographed by a driver. Child beggars are sadly not an uncommon sight in Mexico \u2013 except that in this case, the girl was blond, green-eyed and very light-skinned. Feeling something was \"not right\" about that particular child, the photographer posted the picture to his Facebook timeline, telling his followers to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/case-of-blond-girl-beggar-rescued-from-streets-strikes-nerve-in-mexico-activists-decry-racism/2012/10/27/82d6ea2e-205c-11e2-8817-41b9a7aaabc7_story.html\" title=\"\">\"spread this photo around\"</a>. He argued that something was clearly wrong because the girl's parents \"were brown\".</p> <p>For those who reposted the picture (and there were many \u2013 so much so that officials soon interceded) it is indeed apparently an aberration for brown people to give birth to light-skinned kids, rather than a fairly frequent situation in a country with a long history of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestizo#Mexico\" title=\"\">cultural acceptance of interracial relationships</a>. It's also apparently not normal to see a blond beggar in a country where poverty is defined by \"brownness\". So it was only a sign of good community responsibility that thousands of people were willing to use social media to publicise this oddity. Or so we are to believe.</p> <p>As a result, the five-year-old child was put in an orphanage, and her mother was detained for two days (she was later released, and a birth certificate for the girl was handed over). Unsurprisingly, many Mexican activists have pointed to the racism running through this chain of events. None of the concern over the child's plight would be happening if the child had a different skin colour, they argue. The mother also would not have had her child removed so quickly if she was not native. The truth behind these statements have caused an uproar in the country and kickstarted a national debate \u2013 if Mexicans have long accepted and even found an honoured position for mixed-race relationships and people in their country, how on earth can they be racists?</p> <p>As the debate carried on in Mexico, many bloggers and social media users in the US have also jumped into the conversation. While we've rightfully condemned the latent racism that set a fertile ground for the situation to happen, it's also been far too easy to ignore the role the US currently plays in helping to normalise systemic criminalisation of mothers of colour generally \u2013 and Mexican mothers specifically \u2013 in both countries.</p> <p>The increase of anti-immigrant sentiment following 9/11 has created a hypervisibility of South American women's bodies, and their presumed ability to give birth. In the eyes of many, they are the brown-skinned, illegal, poverty-stricken ones who \"sneak\" over the border to <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-07/us/arizona.citizenship_1_birthright-citizenship-illegal-immigrants-arizona-legislators?_s=PM:US\" title=\"\">\"drop anchors\" so they can get a \"free ride\" through life</a>. This hypervisibility extends to their parenting as well: Mexican mothers who are on welfare are <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/security/2010/03/09/175939/numbersusa-immigration-tea-party/?mobile=nc\" title=\"\">considered culpable of draining the system</a> of limited resources. Those who fight for their right to remain with their US-born children are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvira_Arellano#Impact\" title=\"\">considered to be \"exploiting\" the child</a>. Mothers who don't speak English are considered such bad parents, <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1918941,00.html\" title=\"\">they lose custody of their children</a>.</p> <p>In that regard, the US is not that different from Mexico. What would have happened if a Spanish-speaking, dark-skinned woman was driving to her job in Arizona with her blond light-skinned child in the back seat, and just so happened to be observed by somebody with a camera? Would the reaction of government authorities (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_SB_1070\" title=\"\">emboldened by SB 1070, deemed the strictest anti-illegal immigration measure in recent US history</a>) or thousands of social media users be any different in the US than it was in Mexico? My bet is that it wouldn't.</p> <p>Mexico has incredible problems with racism, and this story has helped to expose them, albeit at the expense of a young child and her family. But Mexico does not exist as a separate unrelated entity from the US. To truly understand those dynamics, we should scrutinise how the racism at play in the US interacts with the racism taking place in Mexico, and question our own understandings of \"race\" within the context of our own communities. This work begins with interrogating the image that springs to mind when you hear \"Mexican beggar child\".</p>",

  "<p>Swiss banking giant UBS is cutting up to 10,000 jobs worldwide as it scales back its investment banking operations.</p> <p>In one of the biggest banking job culls since Lehman Brothers, the axe will fall heavily in London and New York, where UBS's investment banking operations are based. In London, about two-thirds of its 6,500 staff work in investment banking. The rest work in wealth and asset management, which are not affected by the latest cuts.</p> <p>The Zurich-based bank plans to reduce its global headcount from 64,000 to 54,000 in the next three years and said some 2,500 jobs will go in Switzerland. It declined to give further detail. It is winding downits fixed-income activities if they are no longer profitable as a result of new capital rules on riskier busineses introduced since the financial crisis. Some 2,000 front-office staff will lose their jobs, with knock-on effects on supporting roles.</p> <p>A spokesman denied reports on Twitter that some staff cannot get into the London offices beside Liverpool Street station because their passes have stopped working. He said: \"When people arrive they go up in a room and get told by someone from HR.\"</p> <p>According to Bloomberg News, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-30/ubs-plans-10-000-job-cuts-raises-profitability-goal-after-loss.html\" title=\"\">around 100 traders in fixed income in London</a> are being put on special leave. They are being sent home on full pay as the consultation process for their departure begins.</p> <p>The restructuring is expected to deliver savings of \u00a33.5bn by 2015.</p> <p>Chief executive Sergio Ermotti said: \"This decision has been a difficult one, particularly in a business such as ours that is all about its people. Some reductions will result from natural attrition and we will take whatever measures we can to mitigate the overall effect. Throughout the process we will ensure that our people will be supported and treated with care.\"</p> <p>The news came as UBS posted a loss of \u00a31.4bn for three months to September, compared with a profit of \u00a3670m a year ago. The bank took a one-off charge of \u00a32bn linked to the restructuring of its investment banking division and a debt-related charge of \u00a3574m.</p> <p>It wants to focus on its private bank and leave other business lines, mainly in fixed income. The Swiss bank said these divisions had been \"rendered uneconomical by changes in regulation and market developments\".</p> <p>The remaining investment bank operations - equities, foreign exchange trading, corporate advice, and precious metals trading - will be run by Andrea Orcel, a recent Ermotti hire from Bank of America.</p> <p>\"The net impact of all these changes will be transformational for the firm,\" chairman Axel Weber and Ermotti told shareholders in a letter. \"Our overall earnings should be less volatile, more consistent and of higher quality.\"</p> <p>Profits slid 40% to \u00a31.5bn in the first six months of the year. UBS said in July that the botched stock market listing of Facebook cost it \u00a3227m. It blamed the loss on Nasdaq's \"gross mishandling\" of the flotation, which involved a series of technical errors that caused a delay in the start of trading of Facebook shares in May.</p> <p>Former UBS investment banker Kweku Adoboli, who is accused of almost sinking the bank with illicit dealing, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/29/kweku-adoboli-rogue-trader-denial\" title=\"\">denied on Monday that he had been a rogue trader</a> when he lost the bank \u00a31.4bn. He said other members of his team knew about his \"off book\" activities. The 32-year-old is currently on trial at Southwark crown court in London, accused of gambling away the money while working for UBS during the global financial crisis.</p>",
  "<p>Over the past year we've seen increasingly alarming headlines about the number of young people unemployed in the UK. More shocking is the number of graduates who have studied hard at university, only to come out on the other side to no jobs and a bleak working future.</p> <p>The job market has changed significantly and there are seven new realities that every graduate must face in order to succeed:</p> <h2><strong>You may be on the job market for longer than you think</strong></h2> <p>The average graduate now spends six months on the job market before landing a full-time job. If you find yourself in this situation, make the most of it by doing one of these four things:</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Learn something new. </strong>You can teach yourself anything you want these days online and for free. Log on and pick up a new skill while you wait for a job; the more skills you have, the more value you add to an employer and the more employable you become.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Volunteer. </strong>Voluntary work is a great way to build your skills and boost your CV. It gives you a reason to get out of the house and can help <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/work/hidden-cost-of-youth-unemployment-is-depression-and-poor-physical-health-8163179.html\" title=\"\">avoid the depression and sense of worthlessness</a> that can come with long-term unemployment.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Travel.</strong> If you can afford to travel and explore new destinations, do so. Travelling makes you more interesting as a candidate and <a href=\"http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/article/4170824/international-experience-on-your-cv/\" title=\"\">employers are generally impressed</a> by candidates who have the get-up-and-go to adapt to cultural environments outside their comfort zone.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Freelance.</strong> If you have any secondary skills such as web design, typing or even baking, you can exchange these for cash on freelance sites like <a href=\"http://www.peopleperhour.com/?abt=v3_2&amp;utm_expid=3894779-13&amp;utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.uk%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3D%26esrc%3Ds%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D1%26ved%3D0CC8QFjAA%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.peopleperhour.com%252F%26ei%3De4-OUJHbIYaYhQfwp4HABQ%26usg%3DAFQjCNFnWvcn8DIwR_KQiwmwgYwXoYqQOg\" title=\"\">People per Hour</a>, <a href=\"https://www.elance.com/\" title=\"\">Elance</a> and <a href=\"http://fiverr.com/\" title=\"\">Fiverr</a>. It may not turn you into the next Richard Branson, but it can put some extra change in your pocket while you wait for that job.</p> <h2><strong>You may need to lower your salary expectations</strong></h2> <p>If you land yourself a graduate position in investment banking, you can expect to <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9500941/Investment-banks-raise-starting-salaries-to-attract-graduates-put-off-by-scandals.html\" title=\"\">earn as much as \u00a350,000</a> as a starting salary, compared with the more modest \u00a324,000 in retail and \u00a323,000 in the public sector.</p> <p>However, these figures only apply to positions in the Top 100 companies. Outside of this, the truth is more sobering; starting salaries are closer to \u00a316,000-\u00a318,000 as a graduate. But remember, a low starting salary is better than no salary at all so initially it may be a good idea to take any job within your field, just to get your foot on the career ladder.</p> <h2><strong>You can't follow the crowd and win</strong></h2> <p>The job market exists on two levels \u2013 visible and hidden. The visible market refers to jobs that are publicly advertised and due to the nature of their visibility, attract a lot of competition.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://mildredtalabi.com/hidden-job-market\" title=\"\">hidden job market</a> is where jobs come about through other methods such as speculative applications, word-of-mouth, networking, or going through recruitment agencies. Experts estimate as much as 60% of jobs are never actually advertised (some say more) so if you want to win in your job hunt, avoid the crowd and tap into the hidden market instead.</p> <h2><strong>Ignore social media at your peril</strong></h2> <p>Recruiters are now putting more emphasis on social media to attract quality candidates so if you don't have a social media presence you could be short-changing your job search.</p> <p>There are many social networking sites and while you can't be everywhere, it's good to at least have a presence on LinkedIn and Twitter. And while you're at it, search on your name to see what comes up online and remove any pictures or information that doesn't portray you in a professional manner.</p> <h2><strong>Your USP matters \u2013 find it and flaunt it</strong></h2> <p>It is no longer enough to wave the 'I went to university' flag to guarantee employment \u2013 you need a unique selling point that makes you stand out from your competitors.</p> <p>This could be the travelling experience mentioned earlier, the diversity of languages you speak, a business you've set up on the side \u2013 anything positive that is likely to be uncommon to other jobseekers. Once you find your USP, flaunt it on your CV, cover letter, application forms and at interviews. Don't be shy about it \u2013 the better you are at selling yourself, the more likely you are to get hired.</p> <h2><strong>You may need to work for free</strong></h2> <p>I'm not advocating exploitation under illegal internships but short-term work experience can be extremely beneficial, particularly if it's in the field you wish to build a career in.</p> <p>Of course not everyone can afford to work for free, but if you're able to, here are five reasons why you should:</p> <p>\u2022 It allows you to experiment and find out what you like and don't like for your future career<br>\u2022 It helps you to build vital skill and experience that can help with employment<br>\u2022 It can provide access to the right people in your industry<br>\u2022 It can directly open doors to paid employment<br>\u2022 It allows you to build your CV</p> <h2><strong>If all else fails, hire yourself</strong></h2> <p>More and more graduates are choosing to work for themselves either as a short-term solution to unemployment, or a longer-term alternative to being an employee.</p> <p>Even if you venture in this direction and decide to go back to work at a later date, the skills and experience you would have accumulated in the process \u2013 not to mention the character traits \u2013 are likely to boost that all-important USP rating and make you a much more desirable candidate to forward-thinking employers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mildredtalabi.com\" title=\"\"><em>Mildred Talabi</em></a><em> speaks, writes and blogs about careers.
