  "<p>The fallout from a claim by a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2012/oct/26/john-sununu-colin-powell-obama\"> prominent Romney supporter</a> that former Bush secretary of state Colin Powell endorsed Barack Obama on racial grounds showed no sign of abating on Friday.</p> <p>John Sununu, who is the co-chair of Mitt Romney's campaign, said on Thursday that Powell endorsed the president because both men are black.</p> <p>He told CNN: \"When you take a look at Colin Powell, you have to wonder whether that's an endorsement based on issues or whether he's got a slightly different reason for preferring President Obama\".</p> <p>Sununu, a former governor of New Hampshire, added: \"I think when you have somebody of your own race that you're proud of being president of the United States. I applaud Colin for standing with him\".</p> <p>Sununu later issued a statement attempting to distance himself from the remarks, but Democratic mayor of Newark, Cory Booker, said Sununu's comments were \"disrespectful\" in an interview on CNN.</p> <p>\"Whatever he meant or not, it was a statement that is unfortunate and just reflects a lack of understanding and sensitivity,\" Booker said. \"He's gotten himself in a jam, and he's going to wear that jam for a while.\"</p> <p>Booker said Sununu's claims were \"unfortunate, and we should talk about those issues and presumptions that still often exist\" but added that in \"these last days, let's focus on the candidates themselves, what their plans and platforms are\".</p> <p>The row comes as the Romney campaign is still under pressure to distance itself from Richard Mourdock, the Senate candidate who is personally endorsed by Mitt Romney but has been the subject of intense criticism after claiming that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/25/republican-richard-mourdock-rape-remark\">pregnancies from rape are \"something that God intended to happen\"</a>.</p> <p>In his statement on Thursday, Sununu did not apologise for his remarks, although he appeared to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/10/sununu-powells-endorsement-of-obama-racedriven-147310.html?hp=\" f3\"\">row back somewhat</a>.</p> <p>\"Colin Powell is a friend and I respect the endorsement decision he made and I do not doubt that it was based on anything but his support of the president's policies. Piers Morgan's question was whether Colin Powell should leave the party, and I don't think he should,\" Sununu said.</p> <p>Colin Powell endorsed Obama in 2008 and <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505263_162-57539893/colin-powell-endorses-barack-obama-for-president/\">announced his support</a> for a second term on Thursday, praising the president's handling of the economy.</p> <p>\"I think, generally, we've come out of the dive and we're starting to gain altitude,\" Powell told CBS This Morning, adding that \"housing is now starting to pick up\" and \"consumer confidence is rising\".</p> <p>The former secretary of state also criticised Romney's malleable positions on foreign policy. \"The governor who was speaking on Monday night at the debate was saying things that were quite different from what he said earlier,\" Powell said. \"I'm not quite sure which Governor Romney we would be getting with respect to foreign policy.\"</p> <p>It is not the first time Sununu has been criticised for comments about Obama. After the first presidential debate in Denver, Sununu described Obama as \"lazy\" on MSNBC, <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/andrea-mitchell-visibly-shocked-after-sununu-calls-obama-lazy-asks-him-if-he-would-take-it-back/\">leaving host Andrea Mitchell visibly shocked</a>.</p> <p>\"What people saw last night, I think, was a president who revealed his incompetence \u2013 how lazy and detached he is and how he has absolutely no idea how serious the economy problems of the country are and how he has failed to even address them,\" Sununu said. </p> <p>In July <a href=\"http://www.gotchamediablog.com/2012/07/fox-news-john-sununu-says-obama-was-in.html\">he told Fox News </a> that Obama has \"no idea how the American system functions\".</p> <p>Sununu added: \"And we shouldn't be surprised about that, because he spent his early years in Hawaii smoking something, spent the next set of years in Indonesia, another set of years in Indonesia, and frankly, when he came to the US, he worked as a community organizer, which is a socialized structure.\"</p>",
  "<p>The newspaper industry could have the toughest system of press self-regulation in the free world established within three months of approval, Lord Black, chairman of the Press Standards Board of Finance, has said.</p> <p>A state-regulated system could take up to three years to establish, and possibly longer because of the threat of a legal challenge to some form of statutory based system, he said.</p> <p>Black is also executive director of the Telegraph Media Group and central to the campaign mounted by many newspapers to head off regulation before publication of the Leveson inquiry report.</p> <p>It is the first time that the newspaper industry has suggested that it could put a new system of press regulation in place so quickly, a spokesman for the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) said on Friday. In a sign of some newspapers' determination to oppose any form of regulation, even as a backstop, Lord Black told peers on Thursday that there was a \"binary choice. There is no easy middle way\".</p> <p>Senior Conservatives believe Leveson could propose much stronger, independent regulation answerable in some form to Ofcom, the current broadcasting regulator.</p> <p>With the support of much of the newspaper industry, the PCC chair, Lord Hunt, has proposed a new system of regulation legally underpinned through enforceable commercial contracts.</p> <p>\"Each publisher would be required to sign a contract with the regulator which will be enforceable through the civil law.</p> <p>\"The contract would bind publications into the system and equip the new regulator with powers of enforcement, effectively compelling co-operation with the regulator by enabling it to sue for any contractual breaches,\" he said.</p> <p>Black spoke of fines of up to \u00a31m. His intervention is part of a growing propaganda war between newspapers, broadly allied with key Conservative figures \u2013 although not at present the prime minister \u2013 on the one hand, and Labour and the Liberal Democrats on the other. Both sides have spawned campaign organisations \u2013 <a href=\"http://hackinginquiry.org/\" title=\"\">Hacked Off</a>, which makes the case for statutory underpinning, and the <a href=\"http://www.freespeechnetwork.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Free Speech Network</a>, which is opposed.</p> <p>A Channel 4 camerawoman accompanying Hugh Grant was refused entrance to the Free Speech Network launch. Another camera crew was already filming the event.</p> <p>In a sign of the tensions within the coalition over the issue, Lord Razzall speaking for the Liberal Democrats strongly backed statutory underpinning. He said: \"There is a very clear distinction between a statute that allows political interference in what newspapers want to publish and an entirely independent body established in law that holds powerful press interests to account for implementing their own codes of conduct.\"</p> <p>He said it was perfectly possible \"to establish an independent backstop regulator with powers carefully prescribed in law which does not interfere with content but simply ensures the self-regulated keep their own promises\".</p> <p>He added that no politician could be allowed on any backstop body on media matters. It is understood his position matches that of Nick Clegg.</p> <p>Viscount Younger of Leckie speaking for the government said he noted Lord Black's remarks about the slippery slope of state intervention. But he added: \"I think it is helpful to be clear that regulating process may not be the same as regulating content if it came to a form of statutory underpinning.\"</p> <p>A second Liberal Democrat peer, Lord Stoneham, also insisted that all newspaper companies and bloggers would have to sign up to a new editors' code. \"We cannot have companies simply dropping out \u2026 when they dislike a particular system'\" he said.</p> <p>He suggested a range of incentives or penalties to encourage newspapers to join the system of regulation, including better protection in the courts for defamation and public interest cases, cheaper insurance and even tax incentives.</p>",
  "<p>Harlem D\u00e9sir, the former anti-racism campaigner, will take leadership of the French Socialist party at a congress this weekend \u2013 the first time a black politician has headed a major French party.</p> <p>D\u00e9sir, an MEP, shot to fame in the 1980s as a young anti-discrimination campaigner who headed the SOS Racisme movement in France, leading vast street rallies against prejudice and the rise of the far right. Born in Paris to a father from the French Caribbean island of Martinique and a mother from Alsace, he was named Harlem as a tribute to the struggles of African Americans after slavery.</p> <p>In his 20s he was a feisty rights advocate who captivated TV audiences, a philosophy graduate from an ordinary background who had not studied at the elite graduate schools that dominate the political class. But now, after decades as a faithful apparatchik of the Socialist party machine, the media has criticised him for wooden, mealy-mouthed politician-speak and warned he lacked the charisma to be a potential French Barack Obama. Seen as willing to unquestioningly toe the line under Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's presidency, D\u00e9sir is under pressure to make his mark and spell out his vision for the party at this weekend's party congress in Toulouse.</p> <p>He takes over at a moment when the Socialist party enjoys the most power it has ever had in France, holding the presidency, the parliament, the senate, and most regions and large cities. But he must also draw a line under the bitter in-fighting which has characterised the party in recent years.</p> <p>D\u00e9sir has come under fire from the right for a 1998 conviction and 18-month suspended prison sentence over a pay cheque for a nonexistent job which he has dismissed has an \"error of youth\".</p> <p>Asked this week by a regional newspaper what he thought of French people's view of him as someone \"quite austere\", he said he defended the right to be \"serious\" in a time of crisis.</p>",

  "<p>142 Rue de Montmartre is a fairly innocuous-looking building on a fairly innocuous-looking Parisian street. There's no facade, no neon logo, no clue as to what happens inside; just a black wall with a door, next to a 24-hour supermarket on one side and a key cutters on the other. It's basically a multicoloured beaded door curtain away from looking like a Soho sex shop. What it is, in fact, is Silencio: Paris's first private members club, designed by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/davidlynch\" title=\"\">David Lynch</a>, and based on the club that appears in his 2001 cinematic headfuck, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/90677/mulholland.drive\" title=\"\">Mulholland Drive</a>.</p> <p>\"We are a very long way from home,\" whispers <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/polica\" title=\"\">Poli\u00e7a</a> frontwoman Channy Leaneagh, surveying her surroundings from a stage framed in gold and bookended by blood red velvet drapes. She means it literally \u2013 she lives in Minneapolis \u2013 but also metaphorically. Just over a year ago, Channy and her band (bass player Chris Bierden and drummers Ben Ivascu and Drew Christopherson) barely knew each other; <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/boniver\" title=\"\">Bon Iver</a> was yet to call them the best band he'd ever heard; SXSW had yet to fall completely in love with them; and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/jayz\" title=\"\">Jay-Z</a> hadn't premiered one of their videos on his blog.</p> <p>Recorded in just two weeks and written instinctively following the demise of Channy's marriage, Poli\u00e7a's debut album Give You The Ghost is a sometimes violent near-celebration of the end of something monumental, all wrapped up in guazy, claustrophobic post-rock R&amp;B. It's not hugely surprising that the lyric Channy couldn't get out of her head when writing the album was \"don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me\" from Jai Paul's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEjYt2qNwmg\" title=\"\">BTSTU</a>; that track's similar mix of fragility and aggression is at the core of Poli\u00e7a songs Form and the crushing Happy Be Fine.</p> <p>\"It sort of makes me feel vulnerable and maybe embarrassed to sing those songs, but it was a really dark time in my life,\" Channy says, enjoying a cocktail before the show. \"I was feeling pretty shitty and very sad, so I think that although these songs aren't necessarily biographical it's more the feeling of being confused about who is the enemy and who is the victim and really wishing that the person you've hurt would just kick you in the face so that you could maybe even things out a little bit.\" Blimey.</p> <p>The split was compounded by the fact that Channy and her husband, local musician Alexei Moon Casselle, were also both in Roma Di Luna, a successful folk band that grew out of the pair's early days spent busking in Minneapolis. \"We started the band in 2006 and during that time I had a baby,\" she explains. \"That meant our marriage became the band, and it was my first time being in a band and my first time being married.\" As their success grew, the band's dynamic shifted. \"My husband was always more of the performer. I toured with him, I drove and sold merch. Then all of sudden more and more I was becoming the frontperson. It was a strange switch in roles and it sort of screwed things up a little bit.\"</p> <p>As the relationship and the band were coming to an end, Channy was encouraged to work with local maverick Ryan Olson who was assembling a troupe of musicians \u2013 25 to be exact \u2013 for his latest project, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/mar/30/new-band-gayngs\" title=\"\">Gayngs</a>. Olson had been a fan of Channy's for a while and was keen to get her to add backing vocals to the album he was masterminding. Having been pushed to the front with her old band to the detriment of her marriage, she jumped at the chance to fade into the background. \"It was a place where I could learn a lot and not really be noticed,\" she says. \"I remember some guys would be like, 'Oh, is Channy still in the band?' It was a place for me to slip back and observe.\"</p> <h2>'We got stuck in the snow in the mountains in Colorado\u2026 There was no phone service. The guys all pushed and I was just sat crying in the corner. It was scary'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://player.muzu.tv/player/getPlayer/a/26082/vidId=1282201&amp;la=n\"> <object width=\"460\" height=\"369\" id=\"muzuplayer-26082\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.muzu.tv/player/getPlayer/a/26082/vidId=1282201&la=n\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://player.muzu.tv/player/getPlayer/a/26082/vidId=1282201&la=n\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" wmode=\"transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"369\" name=\"muzuplayer-26082\"></embed></object><br /><a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/nme/polica-lay-your-cards-out-music-video/1282201/\">NME - Polica - 'Lay Your Cards Out'</a> on <a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/\">MUZU.TV</a>. </figure>  <p><br><a href=\"http://player.muzu.tv/player/getPlayer/a/26082/vidId=1282201&amp;la=n\">Reading this on mobile?

I think he knows when people are ready for things and who they fit well with.\" Encouraging Channy to start a new band, he played her some old beats he'd made that hadn't ever come to anything. Channy picked her favourite 12 and started writing melodies, instinctively coming up with lyrics in his tiny studio-cum-living room. Having recorded using a vocal processor called a Helicon 5 in Gayngs, Channy was keen to continue experimenting with it, it's ghostly effect giving her songs a strange otherworldliness.</p> <p>Much has been made of the use of vocal effects on Poli\u00e7a songs and Channy bristles slightly when I suggest that the vocals become another instrument rather than something to sing along to. She sighs: \"I don't pronounce my words when I'm singing. I'm not a singer-songwriter. But the lyrics are so important because they help me have the right emotion on stage.\"</p> <p>Give You The Ghost was written and recorded during a heatwave and mainly at night, a clammy, nocturnal feel seeping into the fabric of the songs. \"The album's night as hell for sure,\" the laconic Olson tells me from his home in Minnesota (he doesn't travel with the band and rarely gives interviews). \"Channy would come over at about 9pm and she'd stay until about 2am, which for her is like being up for 48 hours. She's definitely a mum, and I'm trying to stay as sterile as humanly possible.\" Once the framework for the songs was finished, Olson personally hand-picked the rest of the band, selecting local musicians he admired. It was his decision to not include a guitarist because he reckons they're \"just embarrassing\".</p> <p>With gigs booked almost immediately, there was little time for Channy, Chris, Ben and Drew to get to know each other. When did they start to feel like a proper band of friends? \"Definitely when we got stuck in the snow in the mountains in Colorado on the way to a show,\" Channy remembers. \"We were hugging each other, like 'Oh my God, we survived!' We had to push the van out and there was no phone service. The guys all pushed and I was just sat crying in the corner. It was scary.\"</p> <p>In many ways, Poli\u00e7a are a manufactured band, assembled by a svengali-like figure who gets final say on videos and sends his devotees off to tour the world while he stays at home. \"I think it's helpful,\" Olson says of his governing role. \"There's a thing that can happen in bands where compromise can make the worst decisions, where no one's happy.\" So, is Channy happy? She finishes her cocktail with one last slurp. \"It's an amazing job,\" she beams. \"The other day I danced for 12 hours to shoot a music video. I was like, 'What kind of job is this?' It's crazy.\"</p>",
  "<p>Cloud Atlas, Warner Bros' $100m adaptation of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780340822784/cloud-atlas\" title=\"published in 2004\">novel by David Mitchell</a> has been criticised by Asian-Americans after casting white western actors in \"yellowface\" makeup. Directed by Tom Twyker and Lana and Andy Wachowski, the film stars Tom Hanks, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halle_Berry\" title=\"the actor and model\">Halle Berry</a> and Jim Broadbent in a narrative that hops between countries and across the centuries.</p> <p>\"It's an <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cloud-atlas-asian-actors-yellow-face-MANAA-383070\" title=\"Cloud Atlas slammed for lack of Asian actors\">artistically ambitious approach</a> to film-making,\" said Guy Aoki, founding president of the Media Action Network for Asian\u2013Americans (Manaa). \"Unfortunately it reflects the same old racial pecking order that the entertainment industry has been practising for years.\"</p> <p>Aoki was particularly concerned by a segment set in a futuristic South Korea, in which the actors Jim Sturgess, James D'Arcy and Hugo Weaving are made up to play Asian characters. \"Every major male character in the Korean story is played by non-Asian actors in really bad yellowface makeup,\" he said. \"The Asian-Americans at the [preview] screening burst out laughing because [Weaving] looked terrible \u2013 like a Vulcan on Star Trek.\"</p> <p>The Manaa went on to contrast the Korean segment with sequence in the South Pacific, starring the Afro-British actor David Gyasi as a Maori slave. \"You have to ask: would the directors have used blackface on a white actor to play Gyasi's role?\" Aoki said. \"I don't think so: that would have outraged African-Americans. But badly done yellowface is still OK.\"</p> <p>Asianweek.com reports that the Manaa has previously led protests against alleged racial stereotypes in the Sean Connery thriller <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107969/\" title=\"1993's Rising Sun on IMDb\">Rising Sun</a>. They also criticised comedian<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/sarah-silverman\" title=\"the comedian at theguardian.com\"> Sarah Silverman</a> after using the term \"chinks\" on an episode of Late Night With Conan O'Brien.</p> <p>Released today in the US, Cloud Atlas is an extravagant fantasy epic that finds space for cannibals, parasitic brain worms and an artichoke that shoots laser beams. The American critic Roger Ebert has hailed it as \"one of the most ambitious films ever made\", although others are less convinced. Reviewing the film at last month's Toronto film festival, the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/09/cloud-atlas-review-toronto\" title=\"wildly overreaching but not entirely unsuccessful\">Henry Barnes described it</a> as \"a roaming behemoth of a movie\" that \"carries all the hallmarks of a giant folly\".</p>",
  "<p>If you had a set of superhero top trumps, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/123770/iron.man\" title=\"the 2008 film with Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Robert Downey Jr\">Iron Man</a> would probably not represent one of the very strongest cards. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN\" title=\"Imagine Games Network on wikipedia\">IGN</a> rated Tony Stark's alter ego <a href=\"http://uk.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/12\" title=\"#12: Iron Man \">the 12th greatest comic book hero</a> in a recent rundown, below Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, the Flash and even Dick Grayson, aka Robin. Yet somehow Iron Man punches above his weight on the big screen: 2008's debut Jon Favreau-directed venture delivered a modern-day superhero in the form of a reformed arms dealer and scientific genius who uses technology to reinvent himself. A comic book movie which took note of contemporary geopolitics may have been been a slightly unwieldy proposition, but it at least gave us a hero to root for who felt of his time (rather than eternally stuck in 1940s or 50s golden age purgatory).</p> <p>Stark arguably survived a slight dip in form for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/133991/iron-man-2\" title=\"the 2010 sequel\">Iron Man 2</a> but was centre stage for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144027/avengers\" title=\"2012, dir. Joss Whedon\">The Avengers</a>, which promptly became the highest-grossing comic book film of all time earlier this year. All of this means that the stakes have been upped considerably for Iron Man 3, for which the<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/video/2012/oct/23/iron-man-3-trailer-video\" title=\"Iron Man 3: watch the full trailer - video\">debut trailer</a> arrived this week. Bloggers have pored over the teaser in intense detail as they vie to glean the tiniest snippets of information about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/may/22/shane-black-12-rounds\" title=\"Hollywood's master of action\">Shane Black</a>'s forthcoming movie, and it's fair to say that fanboy interest has reached unprecedented levels for the series. The giant sex bunny in Stark's home (which cannot have appeared for longer than a second of the trailer) already has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StarkBunny\" title=\"@StarkBunny\">its own Twitter account</a>.</p> <p>Early signs are that the film might just represent the best Iron Man instalment so far because it poses the one question Robert Downey Jr's wisecracking billionaire has really struggled to answer: if Tony Stark and his alter ego are one and the same, why is it that all their powers appear to reside not in the man, but the suit?</p> <p>Before we rake over the trailer, let's remind ourselves of the movie's synopsis, published last week by Marvel/Disney.</p> <blockquote> Marvel Studios' Iron Man 3 pits brash-but-brilliant industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man against an enemy whose reach knows no bounds. When Stark finds his personal world destroyed at his enemy's hands, he embarks on a harrowing quest to find those responsible. This journey, at every turn, will test his mettle. <br> With his back against the wall, Stark is left to survive by his own devices, relying on his ingenuity and instincts to protect those closest to him. As he fights his way back, Stark discovers the answer to the question that has secretly haunted him: does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man? </blockquote> <p>A couple of shots in the trailer lend credence to this sense of a personality crisis: there's a snatch of a scene in which the Iron Man suit looms over Stark as if possessed with its own volition: later, we see the suit waking Stark and Pepper Potts from bed with a sense of urgency. Has it been compromised, or is it just doing its best to protect its masters? And if the suit is bright enough to act as guard dog, why does it even need Stark to function? The trailer also offers evidence that Iron Man, for all his usual insouciant arrogance, is struggling to come to terms with the aftermath of his debut Avengers mission. And with the arrival of a powerful new nemesis in the form of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/ben-kingsley\" title=\"the actor at guardian.co.uk/film\">Ben Kingsley</a>'s Mandarin, it really does seem to be bad timing for a fit of identity-linked navel gazing.</p> <p>What of the Anglo-Indian Kingsley's casting as a villain who is usually of oriental extraction in the comics? Marvel overlord <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/jul/23/marvel-studios-kevin-feige\" title=\"Meet Kevin Feige, the superproducer behind Captain America\">Kevin Feige </a>has said the film gives us a different Mandarin, one who apart from anything else did not learn his skills from a long-dead alien dragon, so it seems reasonable also to switch the character's ethnicity. On the other hand, why bother calling him the Mandarin at all? And what of Kingsley's strange rolling \"r\"s? Could this be the weirdest brogue since Daniel Day-Lewis in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122167/there.will.be.blood\" title=\"the 2007 film\">There Will Be Blood</a>?</p> <p>Personally I'm pleased to see an actor of this stature playing <a href=\"http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2009/04/13/did-you-notice-mandarin-in-iron-man-neither-did-we\" title=\"Mandarin in Iron Man - geeks of doom\">one of <em>the</em> iconic Iron Man villains</a> on the big screen, and there have been hints that the new iteration was behind the terrorist gangs who troubled Stark in the first film (which ties the whole trilogy together rather nicely). I'm also intrigued by the whole suit/man split, provided it's not thrown in as an afterthought like the misguided Venom subplot in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/118084/spider-man.3\" title=\"the 2007 action film\">Spider-Man 3</a>.</p> <p>It seems likely that the walking suit storyline has been borrowed from the Extremis chapter of Iron Man's history (which incidentally also gave us the Asia-set origins story borrowed by Favreau for the first film). Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian and Rebecca Hall's Dr Maya Hansen have both been described by Marvel as creators of a new nanotechnology named Extremis, which Stark was able to use to fuse more fully with his suit in the comics. We've seen in the Avengers (and in the new trailer) how Iron Man is increasingly able to snap his suit on to his body remotely: might the ultimate extension of that ability be the transformation of the suit into a semi-sentient life form capable of defending its owner even when unconscious? Or did we all go out drinking with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/139926/thor\" title=\"the Marvel superhero, also a 2011 film\">Thor</a> last night? It's worth mentioning that Extremis is also a dangerous virus that the Mandarin has used as part of his evil machinations in the comics, so we can probably expect both iterations to manifest in Iron Man 3.</p> <p>One thing is for certain: with Superman still a year away from returning in the unorthodox-looking Man of Steel and Batman currently in retirement until someone at Warner Bros works out how to trump <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/christopher-nolan\" title=\"the director at guardian.co.uk/film\">Christopher Nolan</a>'s trilogy, Marvel's Iron Man is coming off the back of The Avengers with a genuine shot of stealing the comic book crown. Are you expecting the character's third solo outing to soar above the stratosphere, or fall to Earth faster than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/felix-baumgartner\" title=\"the skydiver\">Felix Baumgartner</a>?</p>",
  "<p>Think of white stilettos as the ultimate in tacky? Fashion is suggesting you think again. Walking at a swift clip away from the 1980s stereotype, they have recently been adopted by the fashion crowd \u2013 from Vogue editors to catwalk models.</p> <p>This month, British Vogue's editor, Alexandra Shulman, tweeted a picture of her bright white Manolo Blahnik stilettos, commenting \"aren't they lovely\". To further endorse the trend, the magazine ran an article on white stilettos in the November issue. Its fashion features editor, Sarah Harris, wants to reclaim the shoes from, as she says, \"tiny trashy miniskirts and frosted pink lipstick and the sort of girls one's mother referred to as 'common'\".</p> <p>The white stiletto once stood for style that was bold, brash and sexy. With class the subtext, they were part of a look that also included short skirts, big blond hair and a Ford Escort. Fashion has longed turned its nose up. As the \"Essex girl\" became a caricature in the 80s \u2013 sent up by Birds of a Feather, Spitting Image and Harry Enfield, along with endless jokes \u2013 these shoes were sent to languish in the fashion wilderness.</p> <p>Such associations are fading fast. White stilettos have been seen on the catwalk at C\u00e9line (where they have been a regular feature since last year) and Chlo\u00e9, while celebrities including Sarah Jessica Parker, Laura Bailey and Gwyneth Paltrow have worn them on the red carpet. They were also a hit on the front row at the most recent round of shows. Carine Roitfeld and C\u00e9line doubled their influence by working together \u2013 the most watched fashion editor wore the most revered fashion brand's shoes and, arguably, a trend was born.</p> <p>That the fashion world has embraced the shoe again is perhaps unsurprising \u2013 it loves nothing more than nurturing something that was once only seen on worst-dressed lists. \"There was a time when a white shoe was tacky but I think a white stiletto now can offer an elegant touch,\" says designer Gianvito Rossi. \"I find it very interesting for the winter season.\"</p> <p>Sales of the shoes are up 30% and high street brands like Asos and Kurt Geiger are experiencing high demand for white styles.</p>",
  "<p>Job hunting can be a long and lonely experience \u2013 especially if you're dedicating most of your time to it. But when 'job search fatigue' sets in, you can lose the appetite for tailoring each application. Here are some ways to keep motivated in your job hunt, so that each application sounds fresh and positive and makes an employer want to meet you.</p> <p><strong>Involve other people</strong></p> <p>Keep other people up-to-date with your progress, as well as any disappointments or setbacks. Family and friends can be a great source of support, but also consider joining job clubs and networking groups so you continue to meet people, share leads, and keep each other's spirits up. It also helps to be accountable to other people so that you maintain your job search momentum.</p> <p><strong>Get out and about</strong></p> <p>It's tempting to conduct all your job search activities from behind your computer screen. Although this is a great way to research companies and opportunities, a successful job search usually <a href=\"http://careers.theguardian.com/careers-blog/the-best-places-to-look-for-jobs\" title=\"\">combines more than one approach</a>. It's vital that people meet you, so make a point of getting out. Attend industry events and start being active in local or voluntary organisations so you get your face known.</p> <p><strong>Organise your job search</strong></p> <p>Set yourself daily and weekly goals, tracking your progress and logging activities. As well as making sure you're avoiding duplicate effort, it's a psychological boost to know that your job search is moving forward and isn't just characterised by rejections (or silence). The sort of goals that are achievable and helpful are: researching x numbers of companies and people per day or week; mobilising x number of your contacts to find a way in to a company; writing a specific number of targeted, <a href=\"http://careers.theguardian.com/speculative-applications\" title=\"\">speculative applications</a>; and setting aside enough time to prepare for meetings and interviews.</p> <p><strong>Take time off</strong></p> <p>A job search is hard work. Tweaking your CV and cover letter, following up on job leads, or keeping current with industry blogs and forums (plus all the research you'll need to do) are all time-consuming activities. Make sure you stay fresh by taking some time off now and again. Regular physical exercise boosts energy \u2014 even if it's only five minutes every hour. Don't feel guilty about taking breaks that will help you recharge your batteries and see things more clearly.</p> <p><strong>Keep the dream</strong></p> <p>For many graduates and career-changers, the dream job is probably not the first. In fact, it's more likely to be further down the line, after you've amassed necessary skills and experience. A <a href=\"http://careers.theguardian.com/careers-blog/graduates-treat-your-career-as-a-series-of-stepping-stones\" title=\"\">stepping-stones approach</a> can help you see the bigger picture. If your current job doesn't fulfil you, stay focussed on the big prize. Find lateral moves that can get you closer to where you want to be, and stay connected to people who may be able to help you get there. Although your present job may be demotivating, always be looking for the next step up, or out.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

He said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Frankly, when you take a look at Colin Powell, you have to wonder whether that's an endorsement based on issues or whether he's got a slightly different reason for preferring President Obama.</p> </blockquote> <p>Prodded lightly by Morgan about what those reasons might be he did not hesitate to expand: </p> <blockquote> <p>Well, I think when you have somebody of your own race that you're proud of being president of the United States, I applaud Colin for standing with him.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/apps/cvp/3.0/swf/cnn_416x234_embed.swf?context=embed&amp;videoId=bestoftv/2012/10/26/pmt-sununu.cnn\"> <object width=\"416\" height=\"374\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" id=\"ep\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" /><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/apps/cvp/3.0/swf/cnn_416x234_embed.swf?context=embed&videoId=bestoftv/2012/10/26/pmt-sununu.cnn\" /><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\" /><embed src=\"https://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/apps/cvp/3.0/swf/cnn_416x234_embed.swf?context=embed&videoId=bestoftv/2012/10/26/pmt-sununu.cnn\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" bgcolor=\"#000000\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"416\" wmode=\"transparent\" height=\"374\"></embed></object> </figure>  <p>Morgan brought the interview quickly to a close. But <a href=\"http://www.kpho.com/story/19920987/john-sununu-top-romney-adviser-criticized-fof-racial\">reaction</a> to Sununu's comments came quickly. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Toure\">Tour\u00e9</a></strong>, the co-host of <a href=\"http://tv.msnbc.com/shows/the-cycle/\">MSNBC's The Cycle</a>, tweeted:</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p>John Sununu supports Romney.

Piers Morgan's question was whether Colin Powell should leave the party, and I don't think he should.</p> </blockquote> <p>Surprisingly enough, Powell made no mention of race when <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505263_162-57539893/colin-powell-endorses-barack-obama-for-president/\">he endorsed Obama for a second time</a>. </p> <p>Instead he praised Obama's handling of the economy in difficult times and expressed support for a range of his policies including healthcare reform, climate change and national security. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398418460\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/17/powell84.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Powell\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When he took over, the country was in very very difficult straits. We were in one of the worst recessions we had seen in recent times, close to a depression. The fiscal system was collapsing. Wall Street was in chaos. We had 800,000 jobs lost in that first month of the Obama administration and unemployment peaked a few months later at 10%. So we were in real trouble. The auto industry was collapsing, the housing was start[ing] to collapse and we were in very difficult straits.</p> <p>And I saw over the next several years, stabilisation come back in the financial community. Housing is now starting to pick up after four years, it's starting to pick up. Consumer confidence is rising.</p> <p>Powell also criticised Romney, suggesting he appeared to have changed his stance on some issues:</p> <blockquote> <p>The governor who was saying things at the debate on Monday night ... was saying things that were quite different from what he said earlier. I'm not quite sure which Governor Romney we would be getting with respect to foreign policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Powell's second endorsement of Obama <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/25/john-mccain-colin-powell_n_2017411.html\">has clearly riled his fellow Republican party members</a>. </p> <p><strong>John McCain</strong> played the role of the disappointed parent. In an interview on Fox News Radio's Kilmeade and Friends he said:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398418461\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/03/27/0327_mccain_140x84.jpg\" alt=\"Senator John McCain.

We were friends.</p> <blockquote> <p>All I can say is that General Powell, you disappoint us and you have harmed your legacy even further by defending what has clearly been the most feckless foreign policy in my lifetime.</p> </blockquote>",
