  "<p>The most musically adventurous trio in British folk team up with Tucker Martine, the US producer who has worked with REM and Gillian Welch, and the results are perhaps predictably unexpected. Lau are a remarkable band, particularly live, thanks to their stirring, complex, partly improvised compositions and the virtuoso interplay between fiddle, accordion and guitar. The new element here is electronic music: it is used to create percussive effects that are matched against their instrumental work on the ambient Far from Portland (a tribute to Martine's home city), or against Kris Drever's vocals on the sturdy Saint Monday, one of several songs dealing with industrial decay and hard times. But as ever with Lau, the mood constantly changes. Save the Bees switches from sombre to cheerful and back, while Torsa is a gentle, then upbeat example of Lau's exquisite and hypnotic musicianship at its best.</p>",
  "<p>If you believe everything you read (elsewhere, that is), you'd think modern pop is simply a cot blanket intended to pacify the masses. Fortunately, there are still true believers in music's potential for enlightenment. One such acolyte is Eddington Howard of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/07/new-band-oddience\" title=\"\">Oddience</a>, an LA-based, acid-laced outfit currently gathering giddy plaudits with their floaty, sunshine-powered, semi-improvised take on hip-hop.</p> <p>\"Music taught me to be a free-thinker,\" says Howard. \"It's taught me how to groove, to go with the flow. Overall, music has taught me to <em>be</em>.\"</p> <p>Oddience are part of a group of musicians who are deploying psychedelic philosophies in new territories. Sonically, these artists have little in common \u2013 after all, unlike, say, dubstep's infrasonic bass, psychedelia doesn't have a signature sound that can be easily appropriated with a Logic preset. What they share is a desire to expand their consciousnesses. This usually means gleefully dumping the conventions of their nominal host genre. <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/electricyouthmusic\" title=\"\">Electric Youth</a>, for example, had a narrow escape from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/feb/25/chill-wave-twee-pop-genres\" title=\"\">chillwave</a>, but their recent track <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRZNyCwaPoY\" title=\"\">The Best Thing</a> sounds like a lost pop anthem. <a href=\"http://kilokish.com/\" title=\"\">Kilo Kish</a>, meanwhile, mix psychedelic singer-songwriter stylings with hip-hop urgency and, as on new single <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" huk4riipow8&amp;feature=\"player_embedded&quot;&quot;\" title=\"\">Navy</a>, kitchen-sink observations about the celestial nature of humanity.</p> <p>At its best, this correspondence school of music weaves the boundaries of house, hip-hop, R&amp;B and miscellaneous electronica into a Venn diagram of genres resembling a Technicolor Spirograph spiderweb. It's at the heart of the avant-garde soul of Shabazz Palaces collaborators <a href=\"http://www.theesatisfaction.com/\" title=\"\">TheeSatisfaction</a>, whose deceptively catchy <a href=\"http://www.subpop.com/releases/theesatisfaction/full_lengths/awe_naturale\" title=\"\">awE naturalE</a> album conceals a multitude of <a href=\"http://theesatisfaction.bandcamp.com/album/theesatisfaction-loves-stevie-wonder-why-we-celebrate-colonialism\" title=\"\">shape-shifts</a>. It's the keystone of Flying Lotus's relatively restrained new album, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2012/sep/26/flying-lotus-until-quiet-comes-stream\" title=\"\">Until the Quiet Comes</a>, notable for reining his sprawling abstract funk into tunes you can almost whistle.</p> <p>And it's central to the aesthetic of <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sethtroxler\" title=\"\">Seth Troxler</a>, feted techno DJ, producer and linchpin of the Visionquest label collective, whose music is yet to find a sound it hasn't assimilated. Troxler's love of psychedelia is lavishly expressed on his <a href=\"http://www.residentadvisor.net/podcast-episode.aspx?id=156\" title=\"\">Resident Advisor podcast</a>, which skipped barefoot from Pink Floyd to hyphy rappers Dem Hoodstarz, while still making perfect thematic sense (his more recent <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/r_co/seth-troxler-essential-mix-07\" title=\"\">Essential Mix for Radio 1</a>, with Jamie Jones, is also a treat). Troxler's curiosity encompasses all aspects of the psychedelic experience, with a particular focus on the power of pattern recognition on consciousness. To explore this, his productions, and DJ sets, contain specific, evolving rhythmic patterns intended to induce a trance-like experience in the listener.</p> <p>Visionquest was famously born out of a communal acid trip shared by the label's founders, and the group now plan to make manifest their vision through a series of events held in \"explorative\" environments, augmented with music to try to open the attendees' pineal eyes.</p> <p>Troxler says they hope to encourage a wave of similar \"large, spiritual events, rather than just having raves and festivals, which are kind of bullshit at the moment. People aren't pushing the boundaries. And if people don't push those boundaries, people forget that there are boundaries to be pushed. Where will that leave us in 50 or 100 years? Is it something that will be lost?\"</p>&lt;  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:leila_h:playlist:1PNWKAXArhGxkq3jg31ybn\"> <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:leila_h:playlist:1PNWKAXArhGxkq3jg31ybn\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  p&gt;The interaction between the listener, the music and the environment is a source of inspiration for other artists, too. FlyLo heralded his album's launch with a fittingly eye-bending video for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuQGfk9Gmgo\" title=\"\">Putty Boy Strut</a> by psychedelic animator <a href=\"http://www.cyriak.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Cyriak</a>, whose own work is inspired by the mathematics of nature. <p>\"The music seemed to tell its story quite clearly,\" says Cyriak. \"It's a journey from naive simplicity to complex discord and back again, with a transformation at the end. The basic sounds and repetitive nature of the main theme suggested something mechanical and yet childlike, so from there I had the subject, style and storyline I needed: a cartoon robot world whose perfect balance is upset, resulting in destruction that in turn creates something new.\"</p> <p>Similarly, LA's Oddience wowed the music nerdsphere with their recent mini-movie <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHtIifSBGEs\" title=\"\">Lit Lava Lamp</a>, which cuts their trippy, cloud-headed tracks, Homeboy Palm Tree, The Dew and Goldblum into a \"tramedy\" about four isolated individuals sharing the same moment that may or may not be the end of the world. \"Where we live is a crazy place,\" says Howard. \"You can create your own reality, because it's a paradise, so it can be whatever you want it to be. You can be this unhappy person in this beautiful, sick, shiny city, but at the same time that's an idea you've missed in your own mind.Once you really open yourself up and look around, this place is nuts \u2013 it's got perfect weather, it's got every fuckin' geographical environment, there's always something to do. I think that mix comes across in the music.\"</p> <p>Although psychedelia is more commonly associated with skinny white boys with Boris Johnson hair and a borrowed sitar, many of its greatest achievements come from the worlds of soul, funk and jazz, whether it's the endtimes social surrealism of Funkadelic's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3bleXWaCk\" title=\"\">Maggot Brain</a>, the evolutionary introspection of Stevie Wonder's Innervisions or the embryonic-electronic generalised freakout of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alA8sjIejRk\" title=\"\">Miles Davis's On the Corner</a>. Howard refuses to self-identify as a psych artist yet he cites this seam as a key influence. \"A lot of the ideas that came out of psychedelia were about peace and love, the connection between human beings, and sharing human experience,\" he says. \"I feel like a lot of our lyrics, as well as the melodies, definitely go along with the psychedelic idea. I really believe in higher learning, speaking your mind, connecting with other people. Psychedelia will teach you a lot in terms of living.\"</p> <p>Peace, love and empathy aside, psychedelia was once viewed as a potential instrument of revolution during the civil rights era in the US: in 1971 vice-president Spiro Agnew personally intervened to block the release of Eugene McDaniels's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_Heroes_of_the_Apocalypse\" title=\"\">Headless Heroes of the Apocalypse</a>, believing it would inspire mass riots. It's not that surprising he wasn't a fan \u2013 aside from that album's incendiary lyrics, psychedelia encourages its fans to question their beliefs. Troxler enthuses that this particular element changed his life for ever.</p> <p>\"You can see the correlation between the music that people listen to and also the ideas that they represent in their everyday lives,\" he says. \"That's something that I think is profound about psychedelia. If you listen to experimental music, your perception of life is also more open. It's about finding that self within, and then when you do, you're much more able to create yourself in the outer world.'</p> <p>Quite aside from the acid and general bohemianism inherent in the scene, psychedelia encourages listeners to view existence more objectively, taking other personal perspectives into account. Troxler likens this process to hallucinogen - and ritual music-assisted initiation rites prevalent in many civilisations from the Americas and Africa, in which the passage to adulthood is marked by a great epiphany. \"With the music, or anything else, it's about giving the opportunity to realise that we are conscious beings,\" he says. \"In many ways I think that is the point of our existence.\"</p> <p>For his part, Troxler sees employing music's transformative power almost as a social responsibility, suggesting that the commercial neutering of music is mirrored by a societal drift away from mass political engagement.</p> <p>\"It's a weird situation \u2013 you want to challenge but you want to entertain. But not to challenge is a lost opportunity for influencing people. Once you go within, then you can stand up and say something. But if you don't, you live in this brainwashed lollipop world where it's easier to just be in a coma and take things as they are. People who are into more challenging psychedelic music challenge life itself, and that's where we make progress. Rather than in America, being like a sheep, where you're told, 'this is not just what it is, but also what it can be'. When you've had the psychedelic experience,\" concludes Troxler, \"the curtain in some way is dropped.\"</p> <p><em>Seth Troxler plays the <a href=\"http://www.thewarehouseproject.com/eventProfile.php?eid=2\">Warehouse Project</a>, Manchester, on Saturday 29 September.</em></p>",
  "<p>With Harvard Law Professor Elizabeth Warren gaining ground in the Massachusetts Senate race, US Senator Scott Brown's campaign decided there was nowhere to go but negative. Brown <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/Senate/2012/0926/Elizabeth-Warren-and-Cherokee-heritage-what-is-known-about-allegations\">has blasted Warren</a> for months, charging that she claimed Native American heritage to take advantage of university affirmative action employment policies. In the first debate between the two, Brown went so far as to say that Warren did not look Indian.</p> <p>But his campaign finally overreached. At a recent Boston campaign event, a group of Brown supporters, including some members of his Senate staff, <a href=\"http://bluemassgroup.com/2012/09/scott-brown-staffers-do-indian-war-whoop-tomahawk-chop-youtube/\">taunted Warren's backers</a> with tomahawk chops and pseudo war chants. Suffice to say that such displays don't go <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/09/origins_of_the_tomahawk_chop_scott_brown_s_staffers_mocking_elizabeth_warren_are_continuing_a_long_tradition_.html\">down well with Native Americans</a>.</p> <p>Brown's first apology wasn't enough for the Cherokee Nation. \"A campaign that would allow and condone such offensive and racist behavior must be called to task for their actions,\" Principal Chief Bill John Baker <a href=\"http://bluemassgroup.com/2012/09/chief-of-cherokee-nation-calls-on-scott-brown-to-apologize-for-his-staff/\">said in a statement</a>. Brown was finally forced to come up with a <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2012/09/26/Scott-Brown-warns-staff-over-war-whoops/UPI-57811348683620/\">stronger mea culpa and a zero tolerance policy</a> on any future stunts.</p> <p>The no-more-Mr-Nice-Guy strategy is fraught with perils for Brown. He won his Senate seat, in part, thanks to his carefully crafted persona as a genial, regular Joe in an old barn coat who cruises around the state in a pickup truck. Even long-time Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, a Democratic warhorse if there ever was one, counts Brown as a friend and <a href=\"http://bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/09/21/brown-warren-push-for-votes-day-after-debate/RtEQIpZLLr2jZyM2A6e2rI/story.html\">waited as long as politically possible before endorsing Warren</a>. </p> <p>The feisty Warren is easygoing and personable on the campaign trail. But she's opted against being either warm and fuzzy or too <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/03/fight-for-the-cfpa-is-a-d_n_483707.html\">in-your-face</a> where it counts for most voters: on television. Her response to the heritage controversy has been muddled and only recently has she come out with a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oIVinDXzOw\">more robust response</a>.</p> <p>Dial up the wayback machine and the personable Brown might well have been making short work of Warren, as he did with state <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/01/21/coakley_aides_paint_portrait_of_missteps_on_campaign_trail/\">Attorney General Martha Coakley in the 2010 special election</a> to fill the late Senator Ted Kennedy's seat. But in this Senate race, personal appeal is bumping up hard against the realities of party politics in a presidential election year. According to Alan Wolfe, a Boston College political science professor:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If we lived in a world in which we vote for the candidate [as an individual], you couldn't lose as a middle class person by voting for either, but we don't live in that world. Party \u2026 matters right now more than the person, and the parties right now have very different approaches to the middle class.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The two candidates break even on the crucial issue of middle class \"cred\". Warren often describes herself as growing up on the \"ragged edge of the middle class\". She worked as a waitress as a young teenager, after her father had had a heart attack. Her self-description could just as easily also apply to Brown, whose working mother briefly relied on welfare.</p> <p>So, Brown's strategy is to keep Warren off her game, which runs on <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-15/obama-eliminates-warren-as-consumer-head.html\">her deep knowledge</a> of the economy, consumer affairs, and Wall Street, lest she get more traction in turning the race into a referendum on the national Republican party and Brown's <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/scott_p_brown/index.html\">Senate record</a>.</p> <p>Four of five <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-massachusetts-senate-brown-vs-warren\">recent state-wide polls showed</a> Warren edging out in front of Brown in what remains a very close race. Warren picked up <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/DNC/Events/Elizabeth-Warren-at-the-2012-Democratic-National-Convention/C3779973/\">her Democratic national convention bounce</a> and ran with it. She hits all the right notes for her Democratic base on Massachusetts middle-class worries like unaffordable mortgages, student loan and credit card debt and bad guys like \"Big Oil\" and \"millionaires and billionaires\". For his part, <a href=\"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/08/scott_brown_says_hes_not_tryin.html\">Brown passed up a Republican national convention speaking slot</a> \u2013 a move that deliberately distanced him from Mitt Romney, the state's former governor and his political mentor. </p> <p>In the Senate, Brown has little room to maneuver on controversial issues like tax policy that are central to Republican orthodoxy. <a href=\"http://www.unh.edu/survey-center/news/pdf/bg_2012-bg32.pdf\">Few Massachusetts likely voters believe</a> that he would raise tax rates on the wealthy Americans. Indeed, he's opposed <a href=\"http://www.investinganswers.com/financial-dictionary/tax-center/buffett-rule-3653\">the \"Buffett rule</a>\" and <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2012/07/25/senator-scott-brown-votes-against-extending-tax-cuts-under-gop-democrat-plans/WsuIo08WEpvOo67TYcwizH/story.html\">lifting Bush era tax cuts</a> on higher-income earners while preserving them for workers making less than $250,000.</p> <p>Bay State voters are cool toward their former governor \u2013 President Obama is expected to trounce Romney easily here \u2013 and cooler still toward the conservative Republicans who dominate the national party. Yet, a strong Democratic turnout doesn't guarantee victory for Warren in a state where independents <a href=\"http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elepdf/2012_Party_Enrollment_Stats.pdf\">comprise more than 50%</a> of the electorate and historically have few qualms about voting for moderate Republicans like Brown.</p> <p>Which is why the tomahawk/chant episode could be a pivotal moment. It recalls a ghost of campaigns past: the 2006 Massachusetts gubernatorial race. Kerry Healey, the Republican candidate and Romney's lieutenant governor, deployed an ad <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1031/p10s01-uspo.html\">loaded with powerful racial overtones</a> against the Deval Patrick, the African-American political newcomer. The tactic backfired badly: Healey never recovered and lost to Patrick in a rout. He is now in his midway through his second term; she advises the Romney campaign.</p> <p>Much is riding on the mood of the Massachusetts electorate. Do voters believe that Brown is still an affable guy who understands their issues better and can make himself heard in a politically polarized capital? Or is the Harvard law school maverick and consumer protection champion the best person to send to Washington?</p> <p>Clearly, Brown <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2012/09/24/elizabeth-warren-defends-work-asbestos-lawsuit/LXxLBL9BBBHIXEDzQoFBLO/story.html\">has opted to keep voters focused</a> on his view of Warren's personal shortcomings. That could be a costly gamble for a nice guy.</p>",
  "<p>In 2010 I graduated with a first class honours degree in journalism. Since then I have had just a handful of temporary jobs lasting no longer than a couple months each. I have been on and off jobseekers support and have now been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/jul/09/work-programme-successful-ministers-claim\" title=\"\">referred to the infamous work programme</a>.</p> <p>I was under no illusion when I graduated that I would step straight off the conveyer belt of education and into my dream job. But a mountain of rejected or ignored job applications later, it feels like a mighty struggle to keep any sort of motivation or self-confidence.</p> <p>Sitting in the sun on a park bench watching the world rush by in a hectic haze can be a perk of joblessness for only so long. My frustration levels are at an all-time high given the lack of opportunities, including being priced out of any further education after hikes in fees.</p> <p>Despite all of the above it would be grossly misleading of me to say no silver lining has been found in my present situation. Here is what I have taken from my experience.</p> <p><strong>What do you want to be when you grow up?</strong></p> <p>You know the question and you probably remember the schoolmates whose hands would shoot up in a split second to answer. Fast forward to 2010 and my hand was still firmly at my side. But the current job market has given me enough time to reflect. Time spent exploring my interests and volunteering on various projects has given me a better idea of where I want to be than if I had rushed into a job.</p> <p><strong>Volunteering: the pros and cons</strong></p> <p>From film-making to co-curating a museum exhibitions, I have done various unpaid projects over the past couple of years. These experiences have been invaluable in building up skills through experience; something employers value highly.</p> <p>The importance of networking has never been more apparent. It may be a clich\u00e9 but in this highly competitive job market, rightly or wrongly, sometimes it really does come down to who you know rather than what. For example, through my contacts at the museum I have been offered a paid temporary role managing the social media for a local arts festival.</p> <p><strong>More support from the government</strong></p> <p>I do feel the government needs to be doing more to help graduate jobseekers.</p> <p>Volunteering, although invaluable, cannot be sustained indefinitely; contacts and skills do not put food on the table. As the third rejection from the local supermarket job comes through the door, I can't help but think a generation in danger of becoming eternal 'kidult's <a href=\"http://careers.guardian.co.uk/career-economy-graduate-jobseeker\" title=\"\">needs more backing and support to get things rolling again</a>.</p> <p><strong>Everyone I know is moving on and I'm not</strong></p> <p>I am all too familiar with the pang of envy I feel when school friends update their Facebook status with their latest career achievement, job offer or travel plans. It can feel like you're the only one not getting anywhere. In the period May to July 2012, 1.02 million young people aged between 16 and 24 years old were unemployed. That's more than 12.5 times the capacity of the Olympic stadium.</p> <p>I try to remember this when I feel as though I'm failing or the only one not making steps into employment. Things will change but for now I am using time to my advantage because who knows when I'll be the one rushing by someone sat on a park bench on a sunny day, wishing I had the chance to work out what I really want to do with my life.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.
