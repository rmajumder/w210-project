  "<p>Reflecting on the meaning of life, the chalk in the water, and why the local Italian cafes used to serve such diabolical coffee, Julian Baggini on Monday takes up his position as the first philosopher in residence on the White Cliffs of Dover. It will be a return to his roots for Baggini, co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.philosophersnet.com/\" title=\"\">the Philosophers' Magazine</a>, who says he was born with chalk in his veins.</p> <p>The white cliffs were the first sight of England for his father, who arrived from Italy in the early 1960s to work as a waiter in the White Cliffs hotel, which has long since changed its name. Baggini's mother came from Dover, and their son was born in Folkestone. He will be pondering why that vision of the white chalk ramparts, 110m tall at the highest point, is so important to millions of people \u2013 even if they've never in reality set eyes on the cliffs \u2013 as a national symbol, just as the Statue of Liberty is to the US. \"My first task is very easy, just to talk to my father about what that first sight meant to him. He came for the usual reasons, adventure, travel, to see the world, to get further than two days outside his village which was as far as most people got. He liked it enough to stay.\"</p> <p>Baggini, whose work includes a consideration of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/aug/01/philosophy\" title=\"\">The Poppadom Paradox </a>\u2013 where people's enjoyment of feeling multicultural depends on others remaining mono-cultural \u2013 also wants to brood about terrible coffee.</p> <p>\"I want to wander around a lot of the places I knew in my own boyhood there and just talk to people. My first job was a Saturday job in an Italian cafe in the town, and the coffee was really really terrible: they had a proper coffee maker but I suppose because the people they were serving didn't care, they didn't bother to use it \u2013 they used to make up the coffee in a great jug and just leave it, and then heat it up with the frother.</p> <p>\"My father had terrible food stories too \u2013 once when they were asked for ros\u00e9 wine, they just mixed a bottle of red and white.\"</p> <p>He has been commissioned by the National Trust, which owns miles of the cliffs, to spend a week thinking, <a href=\"http://whitecliffsofdoverwriter.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">blogging </a>and writing about what the intense popular affection for the place says about an island nation. The trust has <a href=\"http:// www.nationaltrust.org.uk/whitecliffsappeal\" title=\"\">mounted a \u00a31.2m appeal</a> to buy a 1.35km stretch of the cliffs above Dover, which towered over famous episodes in British history, including the arrival of the Romans, the Normans, and the troops rescued from the beaches of Dunkirk.</p> <p>Baggini will be based at the<a href=\"http://http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/south-foreland-lighthouse/\" title=\"\"> South Foreland lighthouse</a>, a landmark built to guide navigation safely through the terrors of \"the ship swallower\", the dreaded shifting straits of the Goodwin Sands. The light was kept for generations by the extraordinary Knott family, whose members worked continuously at Dover and other lighthouses from 1730 to 1906.</p> <p>He lives in Bristol, and is greatly looking forward to his week by the sea. But to his great regret the lighthouse, decommissioned in 1988, is uninhabitable, so he will stay in a cottage down the road. \"I don't expect to be there much, I want to be out and about as much as possible,\" he said.</p> <p>\"My suspicion is that if we look, there is an insightful portrait of the nation to be found engraved in the chalky cliffs of East Kent.\"</p>",
  "<p>A prominent Republican has accused vice president Joe Biden of \"playing the race card\" over remarks suggesting Mitt Romney's plans to loosen bank regulation would put people \"back in chains\".</p> <p>Rick Santorum, a conservative who ran against Romney in the primaries but has since fallen behind his party's nomination, led the renewed attack on Sunday by describing the comments as further evidence of dirty tactics by the Obama campaign aimed at pitting Americans against each other. </p> <p>On Tuesday, Biden told an audience in Virginia, which included African Americans, that less bank deregulation would harm ordinary people.<br>\"They're going to put y'all back in chains,\" he said. </p> <p>Santorum said that Biden's use of \"y'all\" was an inappropriate attempt \"to develop an affinity with the group that you are speaking in front of\" \u2013 taken to mean African Americans, most of whom are descendants of slaves. </p> <p>\"Y'all?\" he said. \"He tried to develop the affinity and he did it in a horrendous way, and he should apologise for it.\"</p> <p>Santorum said that Biden's remarks were indicative of the \"divisive\" tone of the Obama campaign's attacks on Romney.</p> <p>\"It is one thing to attack him on his record and fair game. Go for it. But to go out and do what he is doing as far as dividing the country, and he is, it is class warfare at its worst,\" he said.</p> <p>Rudolf Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, said Biden's comments, on top of a series of other gaffes over recent years, suggested he is not up to the vice presidency and therefore, implicitly, the presidency as the man who would take over the White House if Obama could not serve. </p> <p>\"I mean, there's a real fear is . . . whether he really has the mental capacity to handle it,\" he said. \"I mean, this guy just isn't bright.\" </p> <p>The Obama campaign dismissed the attacks as \"faux outrage\". </p> <p>The president's deputy campaign manager, Stephanie Cutter, told ABC's This Week that Biden's comments were a direct response to Republican proposals to \"unshackle\" businesses from government regulation which they blame for a poorly performing economy. </p> <p>\"Let's look at what the vice president actually said. Speaker [John] Boehner, even [Romney's running mate] Paul Ryan have been travelling this country talking about the need to unshackle the private sector, unshackle the financial industry and the vice president was just taking that metaphor a step further and talking about wanting to put other people in shackles,\"</p> <p>Cutter said the issue was not Biden's use of language but the broader point he was making about Romney's call for deregulation of Wall Street and the private sector which would encourage more of the \"reckless behaviour\" that led to the recent recession. </p> <p>\"They're using that one word as a distraction, but the larger point is an important point,\" she said. \"The president absolutely believes in the free-enterprise system, but we also believe that everybody should play by the same set of rules.\"</p> <p>Obama has already defended Biden.</p> <p>\"The truth is that during the course of these campaigns, folks like to get obsessed with how something was phrased even if everybody personally understands that's not how it was meant,\" he told People magazine. \"That's sort of the nature of modern campaigns and modern coverage of campaigns. But I tell you, when I'm traveling around Iowa, that's not what's on people's minds.\"</p> <p>But there was also criticism from some Democrats including Maryland's governor, Martin O'Malley who said Biden could have chosen his words more carefully.</p> <p>\"I think it was an indelicate play on the Republican words of shackling the economy with regulations and shackling small businesses,\" he said on NBC's Meet the Press. \"It was certainly an indelicate choice of words.\"</p> <p>The Boston Globe newspaper <a href=\"http://articles.boston.com/2012-08-17/editorials/33232304_1_president-joe-biden-slight-indian-accent-racial-insensitivity\">called on Biden to apologise</a> for the comments, saying that if Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, had made similar comments he \"would be pilloried for racial insensitivity \u2014 and so would Romney\". </p> <p>\"In the fight for civility and substance over pointless hyperbole, Biden may not be the worst offender. But he's an offender nonetheless, and he should apologize,\" the Globe said in an editorial.</p> <p>Obama's former spokesman and now campaign adviser, Robert Gibbs, denied that Biden is a \"drag on the ticket\".</p> <p>\"I'm happy to have Joe Biden out campaigning and telling his story to the American people, putting in front of people the choice that's going to happen in this election,\" he said. \"I'm happy and proud of Joe Biden and I'm happy and proud to have him on the trail every day.\"</p>",

  "<p>The white cliffs of Dover have a very special place in the collective imagination, even for those who have never seen them. Nat Burton, who wrote <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%28There%27ll_Be_Bluebirds_Over%29_The_White_Cliffs_of_Dover\" title=\"\">Vera Lynn's famous song about the cliffs</a>, was an American who had never crossed the Atlantic, let alone the Channel. We should harness their emotive and symbolic power, as we should with many other features of our coast and countryside, to help build a sense of togetherness and nationhood.</p> <p>Over several decades, politicians and commentators have fretted that Great Britain has become a disunited kingdom. Last summer's riots were the most troubling sign yet that a large minority does not feel the police, authorities or even shopping centres are really theirs.</p> <p>This year, the jubilee and the Olympics have papered over the cracks, providing a reassuring sense of \"coming together\". We'll be reminded of another such moment at the end of this month, with the 15th anniversary of the death of Princess Diana. But the truth is many of us were left baffled by the mass hysteria prompted by Diana's death, and cold by the flag-waving surrounding the diamond jubilee. Big sporting events and spectacles might give the national morale a shot in the arm, but they are too transient and taste-specific to stand as robust symbols of nationhood.</p> <p>The facets of Britain fit to bind us must have two characteristics. First, they need to be deep and abiding, connecting us to the past in order that we may confidently face the future. But this conservative element needs its progressive complement, which is that they need to express forward-looking values that are inclusive and universal.</p> <p>Both Gordon Brown and Tony Blair spoke of the importance of shared values rather than institutions for forging national identity. But neither prime minister found their symbolic counterparts, and simply draped the tired old union flag over anything new and exciting that could be rebranded by having \"Brit\" slapped on as a suffix.</p> <p>However, we have the right symbols ready made in those features of the natural environment that everyone recognises as meaning \"home\". The coast has a particular role to play here, as Blair recognised when he linked virtues of tolerance, openness and adaptability to \"our unique island geography and history\".</p> <p>It's this history that distinguishes the meaning of our coast from that of the Bay of Biscay or Bondi beach. Dover's cliffs call to mind the Roman invasion; the Battle of Britain; our proximity to, yet difference from, mainland Europe; and international trade and exploration, both fair and exploitative. These are reminders that our values have an ambiguous history, and they need to evolve to preserve the best of the past while enabling better from the future.</p> <p>But perhaps most important, the coast is both a border and a porous point of entry, and so the cliffs remind us that we are a nation of immigrants. That is something the country still seems to be ambivalent about. On the one hand, the diversity it has created will be celebrated again at this weekend's Notting Hill Carnival. On the other, when the latest quarterly immigration statistics come out on the 30th, the general assumption will be that the lower the figure, the better the news.</p> <p>But go back far enough and all of us can trace our ancestry to the other side of the water. Looking out over the port of Dover, with the endless steam of boats coming in and out, every British citizen is reminded that belonging here has never been about blood or genes. It's simply about being at home on this discrete island and being aware of the privileges and responsibilities that brings. Hence the cliffs have the rare ability to create a shared sense of identity that also fully acknowledges our differences.</p> <p>The National Trust looks after 7km of the cliffs and it is raising funds to buy a critical missing 1.35km section. More than 11,000 donations, adding up to over \u00a3800k has been raised so far, suggesting that there is indeed something about the cliffs that resonates with the British. In the trust's hands, unlike other purported symbols of national pride, they remain accessible to everyone and free from corporate sponsors and governments seeking to bask in their reflected glory. But the appeal might also help shift our perceptions of the nation as well as the trust \u2013 no longer defined by stately homes, with their history of blue-blood and privilege, but with the open-spaces whose history embraces us all.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 August 2012. The original referred to the flag-waving surrounding the golden jubilee rather than the diamond jubilee. This has been corrected.</p>",

What history is that? Can you identify this bird's taxonomic family and species? </p> <p><strong>Response:</strong> This is an adult white-bellied sea-eagle, <em>Haliaeetus leucogaster</em>, a member of Accipitridae, the hawks, eagles, kites, harriers and Old World vultures -- large raptors. </p> <p>The white-bellied sea-eagle is a large raptor with long, broad wings and a short, wedge-shaped tail. Adults' upperparts and underparts are mostly white, including the head, leg feathering and tip of the tail. The primaries are black and the base of the tail is grey. The hooked bill is blue-grey with a black tip, irides are dark brown and legs and feet are pale pink. Juveniles have mostly dark brown upperparts with buffy or creamy markings and the head is pale creamy-white. The underparts are dark brown. Adult plumage is achieved over a period of years during a series of moults. </p> <p>White-bellied sea-eagles are resident in India, Sri Lanka, southern China, and ranges south through southeast Asia, the Philippines, Wallacea and New Guinea to Australia. They associate with water -- large rivers, wetlands and coastal areas and they also inhabit nearby islands in tropical and temperate areas. White-bellied sea-eagles feed opportunistically on a variety of animals -- fish, birds, reptiles, mammals and crustaceans, and on carrion and offal. They also steal prey from seabirds and other raptors, and sometimes follow dolphins to feed on fleeing prey.</p> <p>The genus, <em>Haliaeetus</em>, is quite interesting for several reasons. Almost all of these birds are \"species pairs\" of reciprocal sister species that consist of a white-headed and a brown-headed species. The white-bellied sea-eagle's species pair is Sanford's sea-eagle, <em>H. sanfordi</em>, which is endemic to the Solomon Islands, an island cluster located east of Papua New Guinea. Interestingly, with the exception of this species pair, adults of all <em>Haliaeetus</em> sister species pairs have all-white tails. </p> <p>Another interesting bit of information that I dug up is this genus is amongst the oldest living genera of birds: fossil evidence [<a href=\"http://www.sil.si.edu/smithsoniancontributions/Paleobiology/pdf_hi/SCtP-0062.pdf\">free PDF</a>] shows this genus predates modern humans by millions of years. </p> <h2>The Mystery Birds reference library:</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/aug/18/1\">Asia</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/may/12/2\">Africa</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/aug/11/9\">Antarctica</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/may/05/6\">South and Central America</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/apr/28/6\">Oceania and the South Pacific Ocean</a></p> <p>.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. </p> <p>You are invited to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/punctuated-equilibrium/mystery-bird\">review all of the daily mystery birds</a> by going to their dedicated graphic index page. </p> <p>If you have bird images, video or audio files that you'd like to share with a large and (mostly) appreciative international audience here at <em>the Guardian</em>, feel free to contact me to learn more. </p> <p>.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. </p> <p>twitter: @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GrrlScientist\">GrrlScientist</a> <br>facebook: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/grrlscientist\">grrlscientist</a> <br>evil google+: <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/111331532997434679580/posts\">grrlscientist</a><br>email: grrlscientist@gmail.com</p>"
