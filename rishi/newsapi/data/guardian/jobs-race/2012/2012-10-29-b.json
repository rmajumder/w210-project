  "<p>The ancient forest of Selwood once covered great tracts of country that now fall within the counties of Somerset and Wiltshire. And although the establishment of Norman hunting grounds, and later the growth of great estates, followed by centuries of development have felled trees, built towns and spread tarmac, there are places where the sense of old Selwood still survives.</p> <p>One such is in the parish of Brewham, under the thickly wooded ridge from which King Alfred's Tower commands the territory. In a barn there, part of an ancient, secluded farm whose field boundaries have not changed in centuries, I learned about the <a href=\"http://www.somersetwildlife.org/selwood_living_landscape.html\" title=\"\">Selwood Living Landscape </a>scheme. It aims to preserve and link precious wildlife sites, and to encourage landowners, schoolchildren and village communities to value such threatened features of their landscape.</p> <p>The barn owl population is thought to have declined by 70% in 50 years, and one local initiative is the Somerset community <a href=\"http://www.somersetwildlife.org/barnowls.html\" title=\"\">barn owl project</a>. The owl (I learned) needs rough, tussocky grassland where small mammals such as voles (its favoured prey) will thrive. With its sophisticated listening equipment, it can skim low over the ground at dusk, strike accurately with talons that can penetrate long grass and find sustenance \u2013 of which it needs plenty, because of its high metabolic rate. And, with the singular appearance of its white face and its long wingspan, it is a creature people love.</p> <p>The decline is partly due to loss of habitat, and the project plans to set up a manmade nesting box in every one of Somerset's 335 parishes. The children of Upton Noble primary school, like others, are already doing their bit, dissecting owl pellets to find the tiny bones and skulls that are proof of diet, and assembling the owl boxes with large apertures and a ledge on which the young may perch just before fledging.</p>",
  "<p>\"I was just thinking, 'Oh my God. Oh no, oh no. Please, please, please don't let this happen,'\" Jess Varnish says in a breathless rush as she remembers the terrible moment when, during the London Olympics, it felt as if her life had been ruined. As the realisation tightened its grip, and Varnish began to understand that she and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/victoriapendleton\" title=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/victoriapendleton\">Victoria Pendleton</a>, her friend and partner in the team-sprint, were about to have their guaranteed silver medal, and likely gold, ripped away from them on a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/02/britain-disqualified-women-sprint-final\" title=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/02/britain-disqualified-women-sprint-final\">technicality</a>, the 21 year-old kept repeating the words to herself.</p> <p>\"I was going: 'Please God, no, please God, no,'\" Varnish says with resigned amusement. \"I can laugh about it now but that's how I felt. I was on the rollers and the coaches said: 'They're looking at the changeover.' At first I was like: 'Oh, right.' But then you could feel the worry. I don't know how long it took but, eventually, they came over and said 'Bad luck', and that was it.\"</p> <p>Varnish shudders and her words become painfully stark. \"I had nothing then. My world was over.\"</p> <p>She had dedicated herself to the 'Man One' position in the team-sprint for two-and-a-half years and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/mar/31/jess-varnish-london-2012\" title=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/mar/31/jess-varnish-london-2012\">all her work</a>, including 500 practice races in the starting gate, was obliterated in an instant. The unsmiling commissaire in a blazer ruled that, at the end of her lap, Varnish had moved fractionally above the red line before the change box and relinquished her lead to Pendleton a few millimetres too soon. A stonking 1.053sec separated them from their Ukrainian rivals and the result was clearly unaffected. But Varnish and Pendleton, who had set a world record in their previous race, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/02/victoria-pendleton-pain-olympic-sprint\" title=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/02/victoria-pendleton-pain-olympic-sprint\">were out</a>.</p> <p>Pendleton, at least, would return to win gold in the keirin and silver in the individual sprint. The end of Varnish's London Olympic dream was absolute. Her disqualification meant she became the only cyclist in the triumphant British team not to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/07/london-2012-gb-cycling\" title=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/07/london-2012-gb-cycling\">win a medal at London 2012</a>.</p> <p>\"The worst bit was when I saw my family. They were crying and my mum was saying: 'It's OK, Jess, you'll be fine. You'll be fine.' I was like [Varnish puts on a matter-of-fact voice]: 'I know I'll be fine.' But I wasn't feeling fine. My mum always says: 'Jess, let it all out \u2013 cry. It's fine.' But I couldn't cry then. I just wanted to be on my own. It sounds weird.\"</p> <p>Of course it sounds totally understandable \u2013 as does Varnish's reaction later that night when her parents, Jim and Helen, tried to console her. \"Did you hear that I'd dropped my phone down the toilet?\" Varnish asks. \"That very same day, before racing, I dropped it down the loo. I had my earphones in and I pulled down my skinsuit and the phone fell in the velodrome loo. I was just jinxed that day. I didn't have a phone that night when mum and dad were saying: 'Jess, you're getting all these lovely messages' \u2013 because <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VSprint1\" title=\"https://twitter.com/VSprint1\">dad's on Twitter</a>. He said: 'Everyone's being so positive.'\"</p> <p>Varnish shakes her head. \"I was just vile to mum and dad that night. I said: 'Dad \u2013 I don't care what anyone else is saying. This is about me.' That's how I felt. But later that night I read all those tweets and I thought: 'Oh my God, that's so nice.' But I was still upset.\"</p> <p>Varnish is strong, however, and she returned to the velodrome the following day to support <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/aug/03/london-2012-victoria-pendleton\" title=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/aug/03/london-2012-victoria-pendleton\">Pendleton as she won the keirin</a>. Varnish is so close to Pendleton that her own pain blurred with happiness. \"I was with Nicola [Pendleton's sister], holding her baby, and watching Vicky win I was blubbing. I was like 'Waaaaaaah!' It was so bad \u2013 yet so good.\"</p> <p>Pendleton again suffered misfortune <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/aug/07/london-2012-victoria-pendleton-olympic\" title=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/aug/07/london-2012-victoria-pendleton-olympic\">in the sprint final</a>. Her arch rival, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/26/london-2012-anna-meares-victoria-pendleton\" title=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/26/london-2012-anna-meares-victoria-pendleton\">Anna Meares</a>, elbowed her as they jostled for the lead round the final turn of a typically bruising and thrilling opening race. Pendleton still won an impossibly close finish \u2013 only for the commissaire to rule she had come out of her sprinter's lane. She was relegated and her 1-0 lead was reversed.</p> <p>\"If that hadn't happened,\" Varnish says: \"Vic would have smoked her \u2013 easily. To be one ride away from Olympic gold? Meares's head would have completely gone. No question.\"</p> <p>Pendleton still won silver and gold while Varnish's experience only helped cycling's officials decide to change the team-sprint rules. \"Now you have to cross a certain area which is much more clearly marked,\" Varnish says. \"But it's a bit late. I did think: 'Life's just not fair.' I worked as hard as I could and it got taken away. You do think: 'Why me?'\"</p> <p>Varnish is in a good mood, despite her account of Olympic heartbreak, and it does not take her long to decide when her spirits finally lifted. \"It's only just now, after the world cup in Cali. I felt like shit for ages but I've been so much better since Cali.\"</p> <p>The Colombian city hosted the first round of track cycling's annual world cup series this month and Varnish won the team-sprint with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/29/becky-james-british-cycling-olympics\" title=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/29/becky-james-british-cycling-olympics\">Becky James</a>, and finished third in the individual event. It marked the start of the post-Pendleton era and, despite her lack of preparation, Varnish was impressive. \"It was difficult because after the Olympics I thought: 'How am I ever going to do that again?' I didn't have much confidence \u2013 especially after a long break and eating and drinking whatever I liked and having just four weeks' training. I just lost to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/2012/athletes/dffdf328-ce12-4d28-bd5d-b376227a8fcb\" title=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/2012/athletes/dffdf328-ce12-4d28-bd5d-b376227a8fcb\">Lee</a> [Wai Sze, the Hong Kong rider who won Olympic bronze in the keirin] in the semis. She was going really well but both races were tight and I know exactly what I did wrong. A lot of plusses came out of Cali.\"</p> <p>Varnish's new partnership with James is promising \u2013 even if they have still to establish a definitive pattern. \"I went Man Two in Cali and really like it,\" Varnish says. \"Becky is more used to Man Two but we swapped this time because, not having ridden in the Olympics, she had been training hard. At the next world cup in <a href=\"http://www.trackworldcup.co.uk/\" title=\"http://www.trackworldcup.co.uk/\">Glasgow</a> [in three weeks] I'll do Man One. We'll see how that goes before next year's world championships. But riding Man Two helps because, before this, I'd just trained for Man One and that means, in the individual, you race in a certain way. It's all or nothing. But now, in the individual, I want to race smart.\"</p> <p>She is also determined to retain a healthy balance in her life and this past weekend she reluctantly missed the <a href=\"http://cyclingrevolution.com/\" title=\"http://cyclingrevolution.com/\">Revolution</a> series of domestic races, to which she is fiercely committed, in order to celebrate her mother's birthday. \"I want to do things right by my family too and there'll be a lot more Revolution events for me and I can still watch the highlights on ITV4 on Wednesday.\"</p> <p>Varnish sounds ebullient as she looks forward to riding four events, including the 500m time-trial, in both Glasgow and the 2013 <a href=\"http://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/minsk-handed-2013-track-cycling-world-championships-546593.html\" title=\"http://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/minsk-handed-2013-track-cycling-world-championships-546593.html\">world championships</a>. Her competitive chances are expanding but Varnish sounds plaintive when stressing how much she misses Pendleton, who has swapped the Manchester Velodrome for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vt--ro8hYg\" title=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vt--ro8hYg\">Strictly Come Dancing</a>, and a decade at the peak of world cycling for retirement.</p> <p>\"I struggle now without her,\" she says of Pendleton. \"I don't really like it without Vic. But I remember how hard Vic worked and how much she achieved. She trained harder than anyone I've ever seen.\"</p> <p>Pendleton has been Varnish's inspiration since she was a girl in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire. \"I had a Cycling Weekly poster of Vic on my bedroom wall and kept it up for ages. Vic was a hero then. At 17 I was invited to Manchester for sessions \u2013 but I was shy of her then. It was only when I moved up the following year that we became great friends. At first it was weird because heroes don't seem like real people. But she was always really nice to me.</p> <p>\"We're similar in the way we're both so conscientious and work so hard. But we're different characters. It just works between us. People say Vic is negative but with me she was always really positive. Going away to competitions we'd share a room and have a real laugh. I was young and nervous and Vic would be: 'Oh no, I'm doing the same thing as 10 years ago.' So we helped each other. We'd watch Downton Abbey and do our nails and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/28/victoria-pendleton-interview\" title=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/28/victoria-pendleton-interview\">talk about random stuff</a>. We laughed a lot.\"</p> <p>For Pendleton, however, life at the velodrome became miserable. Her dispute with her coaches, sparked by their reaction to her relationship with Scott Gardner \u2013 now her fianc\u00e9 \u2013 when he worked as a performance analyst at British Cycling, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/13/london-2012-victoria-pendleton-olympics\" title=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/13/london-2012-victoria-pendleton-olympics\">isolated Pendleton</a>. \"I was obviously aware of the situation,\" Varnish says, \"and I'd sit with Vic. She was my friend and I'd want to talk to her. She was good for me.</p> <p>\"I've seen Vicky when she's really upset but I thought of her as my friend. I knew she wanted to walk away from cycling but I tried to make her see the good things. I was not naive and I could see her point 110%. Vic and I are really good friends and I don't agree with what went on with the coaches and her but I'm at the start of my career. I need to work with the coaches. They've got lots of experience and skills.\"</p> <p>Varnish is now going out with Liam Phillips, the BMX rider who also came close to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/10/bmx-britons-shanaze-reade-liam-phillips\" title=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/10/bmx-britons-shanaze-reade-liam-phillips\">an Olympic medal</a> \u2013 while <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/cycling/9463993/Laura-Trott-admits-I-am-dating-Jason-Kenny.html\" title=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/cycling/9463993/Laura-Trott-admits-I-am-dating-Jason-Kenny.html\">Laura Trott and Jason Kenny are a couple</a>. But the relationship between Pendleton and Gardner was judged differently for, despite their closeness in age, he was considered a coach.</p> <p>Varnish talks enthusiastically about the future, suggesting that another two Olympics, in 2016 and 2020, offer her the opportunity to fulfil Pendleton's prediction that she will \"smash it\" and win gold. Yet she is at her most affecting in remembering her and Pendleton's happiest moment \u2013 when they broke a world record and won the London world cup last <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/cycling/9463993/Laura-Trott-admits-I-am-dating-Jason-Kenny.html\" title=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/cycling/9463993/Laura-Trott-admits-I-am-dating-Jason-Kenny.html\">February</a>.</p> <p>\"We had such fun. I look back and think: 'That's how it should be really.' After we won we went to Wagamama [a Japanese restaurant]. We were so hyper it was so funny. But we also just wanted to be in comfy clothes. I wore a grey hoodie and grey trousers [Varnish laughs] and Vic had on black trousers and a black hoodie. We didn't care. We were on top of the world.\"</p> <p>That elation contrasts with the desolation they felt after their Olympic disqualification. Yet even that pain can be turned into a positive. \"I'd rather be remembered as a nice and genuine person,\" Varnish says, \"but I've got a kind of anger from it. I want to keep that anger when I race. But the rest of the time I realise that it's part of my story now. It will make it all the sweeter when I do win. But, right now, I just need to step back and remember that cycling is not everything in life. I feel OK again. I feel back to normal.\"</p> <p><em>The Revolution Series cycling highlights are on ITV4 </em>on Wednesday<em>at 8pm</em></p>",
