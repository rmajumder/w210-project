  "<p>When the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/thewhitestripes\" title=\"\">White Stripes</a> conquered Britain in 2001, in a campaign that took all of a week, the novelty of seeing a two-piece band was countered by scepticism from the chin-strokers. \"No bass player?\" they mused. \"How will that work if they play longer sets and bigger stages?\" Countless headline festival slots answered that question, but Jack and his \"little sister\" Meg were still considered unique; the Musicians Union wouldn't have foreseen what happened next. While the myth of four guys who shook the world has served us well from the Beatles to the Roses, in 2012, two-piece bands are now the industry-standard shape of cool rock.</p> <p>Recessionary factors are undoubtedly at play: for the acts, it's cheaper and easier to pack the gear, travel, get gigs and make ends meet; for the labels, two egos are easier to deal with than four, and often more artistically simpatico. The recent success of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/sleigh-bells\" title=\"\">Sleigh Bells</a>, Beach House, Crystal Castles and Summer Camp has shown that a partnership can produce a more tightly focused project.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TRVCtbfuDqw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TRVCtbfuDqw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TRVCtbfuDqw\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to view</a></p> <p>All those acts, like the Kills before them, are happy to embellish their live sound with loops, synths and samples, but those two-pieces who make a virtue of their restricted means are arguably more interesting. Trailblazers in this respect were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/jun/17/1\" title=\"\">Death From Above 1979</a>, who didn't let their minimalist drums'n'bass set-up stop them from going full-on disco-punk. Brighton's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/blood-red-shoes\" title=\"\">Blood Red Shoes</a>, too, manage to channel every early-90s US college rock band, despite the absence of a bassist, second guitarist and plaid shirts. Here to save us from the Mumfords/Marling axis of niceness are doughty folk-grunge pairing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/nov/16/folk.popandrock\" title=\"\">Two Gallants</a>; while in the not-entirely-crowded field of post-Black Keys blues-rock duos you might want to listen to, the <a href=\"http://www.hot-soles.com/\" title=\"\">Hot Soles</a> deserve kudos for sounding like Solomon Burke fronting a 60s power trio (without the bassist, naturally).</p> <p>This year has seen an unexpected Black Keys-style breakthrough for Vancouver's <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16564-japandroids-celebration-rock/\" title=\"\">Japandroids</a>, who've blossomed from a noise-rock duo into blue-collar anthemicists, acclaimed by the NY Times as having \"by far the most exuberant, affirming live show\" of any two-piece they've seen (that's including the White Stripes). The US public agrees: the band's Celebration Rock album went top 40.</p> <p>In February, a Philadelphia festival dedicated solely to two-pieces showcased no less than 40, from turbo thrashers <a href=\"http://hirs.bandcamp.com/\" title=\"\">+HIRS+</a> (who've just released a 100-track album) to intense feminist punks Trophy Wife (not to be confused with the Oxford band of the same name who have three members, the hippies). \"I thought it'd be cool to see what two-pieces were out there,\" Two Piece Fest organiser Craig Woods told the Philadelphia Weekly. \"Apparently there's a shit ton.\"</p> <p>There's undoubtedly purity in a pairing: you can't contemplate the White Stripes re-forming without Meg; it would be every bit as forlorn as when one London boozer listed a knees-up in the Guide featuring \"Chas &amp; Dave (not original Dave)\". With Two Piece Fest inspiring a copycat event in Wellington, New Zealand this year \u2013 headlined by Aussie thrash-pop scamps <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/bands-in-transit/band/details/40\" title=\"\">DZ Deathrays</a> \u2013 and festivals having a tough time of it, will UK promoters be next to see the benefit of binary bands?

  "<p>It's day seven of a debilitating August heatwave in Los Angeles, but Elizabeth Olsen \u2013 deftly put together in an Annie Hall outfit of&#xa0;white shirt, light, puffy skirt and&#xa0;secondhand sleeveless vest (\"I&#xa0;don't know what this thing is... but it cost three dollars!\") \u2013 looks freezer-fresh. Blond-brown hair that should be stringy, damp and&#xa0;shapeless instead bounces against her round cheeks. Her face \u2013 like her physique \u2013 is marginally fuller than the rail-thin look favoured&#xa0;by her famous older twin sisters, the&#xa0;tween-moguls <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary-Kate_and_Ashley_Olsen\" title=\"\">Ashley and Mary-Kate</a>.</p> <p>No one had heard of Elizabeth Olsen before Sundance 2011, when she took the festival by storm playing an escaped cult member in Sean Durkin's unsettling indie drama <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/feb/02/martha-marcy-may-marlene-review\" title=\"\">Martha Marcy May Marlene</a>. Also playing that year was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/may/03/silent-house-review\" title=\"\">Silent House</a>, a psychological horror movie designed to look like a single unbroken shot, which featured Olsen in every frame. Martha Marcy May Marlene proved that here was a young actor \u2013 she was barely 22 when she made it \u2013 ready for anything you could throw at her: trauma, brutality, a creepy rape scene, ambiguity, hints of mental illness. Meanwhile, Silent House involved repeated retakes of lengthy tracking shots over the course of three weeks. \"It's something I'd never do again,\" she says, \"but I learned a lot about temperament and how to keep your cool. You have to talk about all the technical things, and also perform at the right pitch without bumping into the cameraman, who's always right there.\" She holds her palm inches from her face. \"But when you hit minute 10 of a&#xa0;12-minute scene and something goes wrong, and you have to start from the beginning\u2026 Everything you did till then is just for nought. So that can be heart-wrenching to deal with.\" She laughs, with a note of weariness at the memory. \"Especially when you have to do it over and over again.\"</p> <p>Martha was the breakout film of the festival that year, and suddenly Olsen, hitherto patronised as \"the third Olsen twin\", was crowned \"Little Miss Sundance\". \"I never thought I was going to go home from Sundance and find my whole life had changed, and honestly, it didn't. I just went home. But it was exciting. I had been nervous about putting myself out there on film. Theatre seemed so much safer at that point. But people loved the movie. And you can't say that about a lot of the work you do. Sometimes it&#xa0;all looks good on paper, but it doesn't come together, or it's great as a movie but&#xa0;the experience of making it wasn't. That time, it all happened the right way. The first time!\"</p> <p>Her latest movie, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNDhd381xrs\" title=\"\">Liberal Arts</a>, is the first project that she actively pursued. \"Until then, I&#xa0;had been out on casting calls and theatre and movie auditions. That was how I got cast, not because anyone was looking or asking for me in particular. I'm the kind of theatre person who loves auditions \u2013 I really do \u2013 whereas for a lot of actors it's just a nightmare, all nerves and panic. Me, I&#xa0;just love to watch everyone sizing each other up, warily looking around the room to feel out the&#xa0;competition, how people's faces look when&#xa0;they go in and then come out of the room.\"</p> <p>Shot mostly at <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;biw=887&amp;bih=1020&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbnid=IuElGww84Sjr7M:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php%3FlocIndex%3D56316&amp;imgurl=http://pix.epodunk.com/OH/oh_col_kenyon02.jpg&amp;w=400&amp;h=245&amp;ei=iMxIULqNM6rB0QWop4HwAw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=482&amp;sig=105277896821124903959&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=150&amp;tbnw=226&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=15&amp;ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0,i:73&amp;tx=57&amp;ty=62\" title=\"\">Kenyon College, Ohio</a>, Liberal Arts sees 34-year-old Nat (writer-director <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1102140/\" title=\"\">Josh Radnor</a>) return to his old college and fall for his old professor's hyper-intelligent 19-year-old niece (Olsen).

She has said that she almost reconsidered acting as a career back in 2004, when the media had a weeks-long feeding frenzy over rumours of Mary-Kate's anorexia. I'm more interested in the weird notion of growing up alongside twin sisters who were multimillionaires before they hit puberty.</p> <p>\"I never thought about working on movies or television as something super-special that all these super-special people get to do. Neither did my sisters, and they were on camera from the age of a year old onwards [both played the youngest child on the 1987-95 network hit <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092359/\" title=\"\">Full House</a>]. My parents had very little to do with my sisters' job really, at least not after getting them that first job. They always did what they could to hook them up with the right people to handle things, like being child stars and managing assets and running production companies and so on, but they never pretended they could do it well themselves.\"</p> <p>Which is a good thing, right? Nothing's worse than stage mothers. \"And my parents were so not that at all. My mother's a ballet dancer \u2013 which isn't what you call a job \u2013 and the mother of four children, and my father works full-time in real estate. My sisters run their own thing now. They have since they turned 18.\"</p> <p>Still, the shadow of her sisters' success and fame must have dogged her early on, I suggest. People used to come to her room at NYU, pretending to knock on the wrong door just to stare at her, didn't they?</p> <p>\"Oh absolutely. But their fame made me more determined to study. I knew I wanted to be an actor, but I&#xa0;also didn't want to start working when I was under 18. These days, my sisters are mainly an inspiration as business people, and whenever I&#xa0;feel like I'm ready to package some project of my own, they'll probably be the first people I'll talk to for advice. Also, I love their fashion lines \u2013 I practically live at <a href=\"http://www.therow.com/\" title=\"\">their clothes company</a> when I'm here.\"</p> <p>As a child, Elizabeth appeared in small roles in several of Mary-Kate and Ashley's straight-to-video tween-pics. \"Oh, I really got to exercise the acting muscles there \u2013&#xa0;you can't imagine the awesome thespian demands on the kid playing Girl In Car in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110068/\" title=\"\">How The West Was Fun!</a>\" she guffaws affectionately. \"And my biggest scene was getting bubblegum out of my hair!\"</p> <p>Wait, didn't she \"retire\" at the age of 10?</p> <p>\"I did! My parents made me write down a pros and cons list. And the cons just piled up. So I&#xa0;figured I'd keep acting as a hobby until I was older. Because I felt that pressure, and&#xa0;that people would say, 'Oh, that's nepotism.' I decided that as long as I felt confident and worked hard for it, instead of having it handed to me, no one could take that away from me. I don't have any insecurity about it. I never got any job because of my sisters. I could have pulled a few strings through them, but I never needed to.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396124206\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/12/1347446523901/Elizabeth-Olsen-and-famil-008.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Olsen and family\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keep it in the family: Elizabeth Olsen (far left) with sisters Mary-Kate and Ashley, mother Jarnette and brother Trent  Photograph: Rex Features</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At 17, Olsen moved to New York to study acting first at the <a href=\"http://www.tisch.nyu.edu/page/home.html\" title=\"\">Tisch School of the Arts</a>, then at NYU.

I'm a theatre kid, and the centre of that world is there, not here. The moment I get tired of it I come back here.

(\"Best raconteur ever! Then I saw her on Oprah and she told all the same stories again!\") But she's at the start of a career that promises to be a thing of wonder.

  "<p>After months of searching for work since graduating in June from the University of Kent, Lindsey Kendall has had enough. Next week, the 21-year-old from Bishop's Stortford in Hertfordshire will be boarding a plane to New Zealand, leaving behind the gloom of Britain's jobless economy.</p> <p>Kendall joins an exodus of 10,000 Britons to New Zealand this year, plus many more who are heading to Australia and Canada and less-traditional destinations for emigrants, such as Germany and Singapore.</p> <p>\"The only available jobs I could see were hospitality or general low-entry jobs \u2013 nothing for a graduate. So I decided that if I'm going to work in a bar or on reception, I might as well do it in a new country as part of a new experience. I'm heading to New Zealand to start my working holiday visa, and hopefully it shouldn't take me too long to find a job.\"</p> <p>Kendall says that few of her fellow leavers have had much luck landing a graduate job. \"There's only one I&#xa0;know who has got what you might call a proper graduate job. Everyone else is still looking.\"</p> <p>Youth unemployment in the UK has reached one million and is continuing to rise, with figures this week showing 1,017,000 16-24-year-olds now claiming&#xa0;benefit.</p> <p>Sitting out the UK recession by heading to a stronger economy will give graduates new life skills and experiences that, when they return, may help them land a better job. A lucky few may also obtain high-paying graduate-style jobs in their chosen country \u2013 but don't bet on it. Online forums used by Britons on visa programmes for 18-30-year-olds warn others not to expect it easy when they arrive abroad.</p> <p>One commenter on <a href=\"http://www.backpackerboard.co.nz/\" title=\"Backpackerboard New Zealand\">Backpackerboard.co.nz</a> says: \"My girlfriend and I arrived in Auckland with just more than \u00a310,000. The accommodation costs are expensive, food is expensive too. Jobs are hard to find this year. We went everywhere in Wellington and Auckland with our CVs \u2026 I don't have a full-time job yet after one month of looking, but my girlfriend luckily does. Don't be too confident about getting jobs and don't bring too much luggage.\"</p> <p>Earnings are never going to be that high. Don't expect to get much more than \u00a310 an hour in \"hospitality\" jobs, though it may be a little more in jobs in the construction industry. After its earthquake last year, Christchurch in New Zealand is going through a rebuilding boom, although most of the vacancies are for workers in skilled&#xa0;trades.</p> <p>Many individuals, such as Kendall, are happy to head out alone, but others will want help from travel agencies that assist in putting together visas, bank accounts and accommodation. Lucy Fenwick, 20, from Hampshire, has spent a year in Australia, which was partly organised by STA Travel.</p> <p>\"I started in Sydney and worked in a restaurant as a waitress for a few months, which gave me the chance to see the city through the eyes of a local. I moved from Sydney and worked behind a bar in Melbourne and in a clothes shop in Brisbane.</p> <p>\"I loved feeling part of the community rather than just another young Brit passing through on her travels, and the experience has totally boosted my confidence. I've got a far broader outlook on life and hopefully it will make me stand out a bit from the other thousands of graduates.\"</p> <p>But although Australia and New Zealand play host to the bulk of Britons heading abroad for short-term work \u2013 not least because they speak English and offer more generous working visa programmes than other destinations \u2013 other countries may provide just as many opportunities, and will prove to employers you're not just a semi-permanent gap-year traveller.</p> <p>Canada's economy is relatively strong: it didn't suffer the banking crash that affected Europe and the US, and young British people can work there for two years on the <a href=\"http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/united_kingdom-royaume_uni/experience_canada_experience/index.aspx?view=d\" title=\"\">International Experience Canada</a> programme.</p> <p>According to the Canadian high commission, the programme has been very popular this year. \"There are opportunities in a number of sectors for graduates, specifically in the hi-tech gaming industry, and there is always a high demand for workers in construction and hospitality,\" a commission spokeswoman says.</p> <p>Visa restrictions effectively make the US off-limits to British graduates seeking work, and elsewhere job seekers will run up against language barriers. One traditional route is to obtain a Teaching English as a Foreign Language (Tefl) certificate, then head to Spain, Italy or Japan for work.</p> <p>But there is a sting in the tail for already debt-laden graduates heading overseas: many countries demand evidence that you have enough money&#xa0;in the bank to look after yourself. Japan wants to see \u00a32,500 in cleared funds before admitting you, while in New Zealand you need to have NZ$350 per month of your stay. This represents around \u00a3180 a month. Staying for a year would require more than \u00a32,100.</p> <p>So what are the rules and prospects for young people heading abroad? Guardian Money looked at some of the leading, and less obvious, destinations</p> <h2>Australia</h2> <p><strong>Visa restrictions</strong> Up to 12&#xa0;months for people aged 18 to 30 interested in a working holiday. Apply online (A$280/\u00a3190 fee) at <a href=\"http://www.immi.gov.au/e_visa/working-holiday.htm\" title=\"\">immi.gov.au</a>. You can do any kind of work in Australia, but can only be with the same employer for six months. You may be asked on arrival to prove that you have&#xa0;\"sufficient funds\", which is assessed on a case-by-case basis. Anything less than A$3,000 (\u00a31,950) is considered risky.</p> <p><strong>Jobs</strong> The greatest demand is in Western Australia, home to the mining boom. A cafe job in Sydney will pay about A$18 (\u00a311) an hour. Head to the outback to try your hand as a jackaroo (boys) or a jillaroo (girls) working on a sheep or cattle farm. Roles may include caring for livestock, maintaining the cleanliness of the farm or even \"mustering\" (rounding up) on horseback. Full-time work could pay as much as \u00a3300 a week and accommodation is often provided.</p> <p><strong>Cost of living </strong>For a one-bed apartment you might pay between \u00a3750 and \u00a31,000 a month depending on if you are in a city centre or not. Generally, the cost of living is slightly higher in Australia than in the UK, something that is worth considering.</p> <h2>New Zealand</h2> <p><strong>Visa restrictions</strong> There are two options: a 12-month visa or a 23-month visa for UK citizens aged 18 to 30. Apply at <a href=\"http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/stream/work/workingholiday/unitedkingdomworkingholidayscheme.htm\" title=\"\">immigration.govt.nz</a>. With either option you are only entitled to work for 12&#xa0;months, and each is based on certain&#xa0;requirements \u2013 one being access&#xa0;to \u00a3180 (NZ$350) per month of your&#xa0;stay.</p> <p><strong>Jobs</strong> The usual hospitality roles in Auckland, Wellington and Queenstown. Construction jobs in Christchurch. Seasonal fruit-picking is ideal temporary work and can be done all over the north and south islands. It is hard-going and not especially well paid, but you could earn up to \u00a310 an hour for your toil. On the upside, agricultural work is a chance to get up close and personal with the stunning landscapes of New Zealand.</p> <p><strong>Cost of living</strong> The New Zealand dollar, as with the Australian dollar, has soared in recent years against sterling, so food and drink is on a par with, or indeed above, the UK. But rents are still affordable: accommodation in the form of a one-bed apartment might be about \u00a3450 a month.</p> <h2>Canada</h2> <p><strong>Visa restrictions</strong> Working visas available to adults aged 18 to 35 under the International Experience Canada programme. Apply at <a href=\"http://international.gc.ca/experience/\" title=\"\">international.gc.ca/experience</a> (\u00a390 fee). Unfortunately, applications for 2012 have already closed (there was a quota of 5,350 for the UK), but will open for 2013 later this year. You will also need to demonstrate cleared funds of C$2,500 (\u00a31,600).</p> <p><strong>Jobs </strong>The usual hospitality and construction jobs, but the high commission in London says jobs in the hi-tech gaming industry are aplenty.</p> <p>If you want a job in the public sector you will need decent French language skills. And don't be put off by the cold winters; you could turn it into&#xa0;an opportunity. A ski instructor in&#xa0;Whistler \u2013 a job with perks such as a free&#xa0;lift pass \u2013 might earn you up to \u00a3500 a month with food and accommodation included.</p> <p><strong>Cost of living </strong>Canada is another country whose currency has appreciated strongly in recent years. Vancouver often appears in lists of the most expensive cities in North America.</p> <h2>US</h2> <p><strong>Visa restrictions</strong> Very stringent. There is no working holiday visa programme of the type UK citizens enjoy in Australia and New Zealand. You need to have a job offer in place before even applying for a visa.</p> <p><strong>Jobs </strong>One option is the \"J-1\" visa, which allows those between the ages of 18 and 26 to work as an au pair for up to 12&#xa0;months, with the possibility of an extension if all goes well. You will be provided with food and board to work at least 45 hours a week, but must also complete certain courses before you are eligible.</p> <p><strong>Cost of living </strong>Generally, the cost of living is similar to that of the UK, but it can be cheaper depending on where in the US you are. Accommodation costs are extremely varied. A one-bed apartment in suburban New York will be well over \u00a31,000 a month, and \u00a32,000 in town, but elsewhere in the country will be much lower.</p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p><strong>Visa restrictions </strong>None. All EU nationals, including those from Britain, have the right to look for work in Germany. The country is a much better bet than Spain or Italy (suffering from high youth unemployment) or the Nordic nations (which suffer from high&#xa0;living costs).</p> <p><strong>Jobs</strong> Unemployment is lower than Britain, at about 7%, but while jobs are available they could not be described as plentiful. Search for work at the <a href=\"http://www.arbeitsagentur.de/\" title=\"\">arbeitsagentur.de</a>, Germany's job centres. Head to Bavaria where unemployment is less than 4% rather than the old East Germany where unemployment is widespread.</p> <p>Speaking German helps \u2013 so why not perfect your German as a tour guide? There are plenty of travel companies that will be happy to have you, and your job will undoubtedly expose you to some of Germany's finest attractions.

  "<p>There's something extremely impressive about Andrew Prentice and Jonathan Weil's debut novel, an Elizabethan tale set in London in 1592, based around the exploits of the young nipper (or cutpurse) Jack. This is not, however, London as it really was, but as it would have been had the magic rituals of the day actually achieved what their practitioners set out to do. Rather than simply weaving a magical construct of their own and imposing it on their 16th-century players, the authors have remained true to the central belief that magical power \u2013 good or evil \u2013 was achieved through summoning devils, and that containment of said beasts was central to the summoner's survival. Then they've made it their own.</p> <p>Although <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jun/25/fantastic-dr-dee-birth-modern-science\" title=\"\">Dr Dee </a>puts in a brief appearance and the Virgin Queen has a walk-on (non-speaking) part, <em>Black Arts </em>is not of the school of \"Good morning, Sir Walter,\" \"Good morning, your Grace,\" historical fiction, and is all the better for it. It stands and falls on the strength of the characters, plotting and setting rather than a reliance on the pre-existing or the second-hand.</p> <p>Remarkably few titled courtiers appear within its pages and, although the reader becomes immersed in the underworld of Sharkwell, his granddaughter, Beth, and Mr Smiles, we are not confined to the gritty underbelly of society.</p> <p>On the very day that should be Jack's proudest \u2013 his acceptance as a junior member of Sharkwell's criminal enterprise, following his \"testing\" \u2013 his world changes for ever. Among some stolen items, he finds a pipe with a blocked-up stem which he tries to clear. \"He wormed the wire deeper into the stem, peered inside \u2013 and suddenly the wire slipped and a puff of powder came flying out of the pipe, straight into his eye.\" The pain is excruciating and the eye transformed. Now he can see what remains unseen to most: the devils and old gods that haunt the city. Small wonder that he wears an eye-patch thereafter.</p> <p>The same rust-coloured powder has tainted his hand, which flares up and itches in the presence of magic, and is also the mark of the puritanical followers of the crusading preacher, Nicholas Webb. Now Jack is cursed with unwanted weapons in his fight against evil, his battlefield a London which includes whorehouses and real danger.</p> <p>I have, however, saved Prentice and Weil's finest skill till last. They can really write. They write action which is easy to follow, and totally convincing dialogue. I don't know if all the Elizabethan slang in <em>Black Arts</em> is genuine or not but, between you and me, I don't really care. What I do care about is that not only does this slang come across as totally convincing, it also comes across as colloquial: as if it's being spoken by people who always speak that way, rather than having words put in their mouths. This writing duo wear their research lightly in every way.</p> <p>I've little doubt Jack will be back in further adventures, no doubt with chameleon-like Beth Sharkwell and Kit Morely the spy/intelligencer at his side, but I'm pleased to report that <em>Black Arts</em> is a complete, self-contained and wholly satisfying novel in its own right. This is a sparkling and intelligent&#xa0;debut.</p> <p>\u2022 Philip Ardagh's <em>The Grunt in Trouble</em> is published by Nosy Crow.</p>",

One has since been addressed with the arrival from Manchester City of Dave Fallows as head of scouting and recruitment, together with Barry Hunter, formerly City's chief scout for Italy, Russia and Switzerland.</p> <p>Fallows and Hunter, who were approached by Liverpool before Rodgers's appointment as manager, were placed on gardening leave by City and able to commence work at Anfield only after the close of the transfer window.</p> <p>The Liverpool manager concedes the Dempsey deal would still have collapsed had his scouting team been installed earlier as \"availability and affordability\" ultimately determine whether a player is&#xa0;signed.</p> <p>But Rodgers, who insists his say is final on transfer targets, is confident Liverpool have corrected a major flaw from their approach to the last transfer window. He said: \"I've had long chats with the owners. Our scouting team wasn't in place. I've seen one or two things written about a technical team but every football club has a technical team. Let's not say we are trying to reinvent the wheel here. We had a manager but we didn't have a scouting department. Thankfully those guys have now come in and hopefully they'll do a terrific job.</p> <p>\"Operationally these are things we needed to sort out as well as learning from the process. It's a new manager, working with a new group of people. I'm sure the owners will have gone away and reflected on things. We had a couple of good conversations with them, and we learn from that and move on.\"</p> <p>Rodgers and Hunter were at Reading together and, despite not instigating the arrivals, the manager insisted: \"They were appointments I was fully aware of. I've known Barry for a long time and Dave also. Dave was already in the offing to come here. From Dave's position, he would only accept the job if someone like myself was coming in.\"</p> <p>The head of analytics, Michael Edwards, remains part of the team around Rodgers. The manager, seeking his first league win with Liverpool at Sunderland on Saturday, added: \"I can only repeat what I said when I came here \u2013 I'm not a power freak. I don't need to do everything on my own. The modern-day manager can't do that. But you have the final say on players, there's absolutely no question about that. If I want a player and we can't afford it, that's a different matter. Then it comes back to availability and affordability.\"</p> <p>Rodgers has also claimed Liverpool will not rush to reward Raheem Sterling with a new contract, although the promising winger is expected to sign an improved deal when he turns 18 in December. Sterling was called into the England squad against Ukraine by Roy Hodgson, purely for the experience, but that has not altered the manager's handling of the talented teenager.</p> <p>\"After I spoke to Roy Hodgson and I had got through to Raheem, my next call was to his agent,\" the Liverpool manager said. \"I wanted to let him know the news was coming out but to make sure that he wasn't jumping in the car up to Liverpool to have a chat with me when it did. I want to manage the expectation of the kid. The last thing we need is an announcement he has signed a five-year contract after two&#xa0;games. There has been dialogue between me, Raheem and the agent, and that has been it. There has been nothing official. The biggest thing that distorts the reality of people and footballers is money. I worked with players at Swansea who had spent their lives in football and not earned more than two grand a week. Now you are seeing young players who are multi-millionaires. No matter what you say, it takes the edge off them. The point I have made to Raheem \u2013 and he has been brilliant, to be fair \u2013 is that he will earn it. He will be rewarded in time.\"</p>",
  "<p>In a vast, echoing warehouse in Tilbury docks in Essex, a squashy green mountain of bean bag chairs has been piled 15m high, almost to the roof of the cavernous space. There are hundreds of them, most wrapped in clear plastic bags, some unprotected and a bit dusty, a few sagging sadly and spilling their polystyrene guts onto the ground.</p> <p>This is merely the squashy tip of an iceberg, however. \"You can get maybe 400, 500 of those into a 40ft container,\" observes Paul Levin idly. \"I've got 7,000 to shift. That's a lot of lorries filled with green bean bags.\"</p> <p>With the last spectator having vacated the Olympic Park, work has begun to dismantle and repurpose the Olympic and Paralympic venues. Some will be given new uses, others moved to new homes, a few will vanish without trace. But from each will be salvaged an enormous amount of \u2013 there is no better word for it \u2013 <em>stuff</em> that, with the crowds long gone, is now surplus to requirements.</p> <p>So what do you do with 78,206 white folding chairs that, for a few weeks only, filled press rooms and hospitality suites and dormitories? Transport them to a warehouse in Tilbury, it transpires, and try to flog them. That is the task in which Levin is currently engaged on behalf of Ramler, the Australian company that won the contract to fit out London 2012's venues, and must now dispose of their remains.</p> <p>From 50p coathangers to \u00a3790 armchairs, reception desks for \u00a3375 to traffic cones for a fiver, Levin claims to be overseeing \"the biggest-ever fire sale in peace time\" \u2013 and everything must go.</p> <p>Even before the Paralympics concluded, as many as 100 vans, flatbed trucks and huge container lorries were arriving at the site each day, a number that has grown since the closing ceremony.</p> <p>The Olympic origins of some of what's on offer through <a href=\"http://remainsofthegames.co.uk/\" title=\"\">remainsofthegames.co.uk</a> \u2013 the site set up by the furniture company to offload the fittings \u2013 are just about discernible. In the centre of one of the large warehouses, for instance, is a collection, wrapped in plastic, of deconstructed umpire chairs \u2013 used during the Games by megaphone-wielding volunteers to direct spectators around venues. Much more commonly, however, there is little to hint at the glamorous starring role these items have just played in the greatest sporting show on earth.</p> <p>Inside the warehouse there are stacks of wastepaper bins (\"They've all gone already,\" says Levin), and piles of coffee tables, panelling for temporary indoor walls and marble umbrella stands.</p> <p>There are 14,872 LED bedside lamps, 6,326 cushions, 7,496 laundry racks. Just \u00a399 will buy you an athlete's bedroom set \u2013 a single bed and mattress, a bedside table and nightlight. The green bean bags are \u00a315 each. The only hint of each item's origins will be a tiny gold sticker: \"This product was proudly made and supplied to the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\"</p> <p>Because Ramler supplied Games organisers on a \"buy-back\" basis, they will see none of the proceeds from the sale, but these utilitarian fitments are not the only remnants from London 2012 that are up for grabs.

  "<p>Our planet is waving the white flag of surrender. But as the polar flag becomes ever more tattered, with holes scorched by hotter ocean waters, humanity pumps ever more globe-warming gases into the air.</p> <p>The story of the Arctic ice cap is the story of modern environmentalism. In 1968, as satellites began to document the vast ice field blanketing the north pole, the iconic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise\">Earthrise image</a> was beamed back to the ground. It revealed a planet of awesome beauty, deep blue oceans, verdant continents and crowned with at least 8m square kilometres of gleaming ice. The image kickstarted the global green movement. </p> <p>In 2007, a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/sep/04/climatechange\">new record was set</a> for the minimum summer sea ice cover in the Arctic had halved. This furious flag waving attracted attention. That year, the world's scientists declared the end of any doubt that our addiction to burning fossil fuels was changing the face of the planet. Al Gore expounded his inconvenient truth and the world seemed set to act.</p> <p>Today, that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-smallest-extent\">2007 record is smashed</a> and the shredded white flag is now flickering rathering than flashing. But the danger is greater than even, even if the alarm signal is frayed.</p> <p>The last great global ice melt the planet witnessed came 11,700 years ago at the end of a deep ice age. As glaciers retreated, a benign and balmy climate emerged in which the human race has flourished. Our entire civilisation is built on the warm soils left as the ice sheets melted.</p> <p>This new great melting heralds the polar opposite: the gravest of threats to civilisation. Removing the lid from the pole will release heat equivalent to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/14/decline-sea-ice-arctic\">fast-forwarding human-caused climate change by two decades</a>, say scientists. </p> <p>Will this be the first great <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping_point_%28climatology%29\">tipping point</a> to tumble the world into a new and hostile climate regime, as the cooling, reflective ice vanishes? Will the new, warm Arctic radically alter the temperate weather enjoyed by Europeans, for whom global warming has seemed a distant concern?</p> <p>We seem to be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/may/29/carbon-emissions-nuclearpower\">prepared to take that chance</a>. The shrinking ice has not opened new leads for decisive global action to tackle climate change. Instead, in a vicious irony, the new channels are being exploited for oil and gas exploration, unearthing more of the very fuels driving the warming.</p> <p>Decades from now, will today's record sea ice low be seen as the moment when our Earthly paradise gave up the ghost and entered a hellish new era? I sincerely hope not, but with this global distress signal failing to attract attention, I fear the worst.</p> <p><em>\u2022 You can add your <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/sep/14/sea-ice-climate-change\">comments on our live blog</a></em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 September 2012.

  "<p>The senior police officer under pressure to resign over his role in the Hillsborough operation was fighting to hold on to his job on Friday, apologising for further upsetting fans in comments he made this week.</p> <p>Sir Norman Bettison, chief constable of West Yorkshire, who is resisting calls from the families of the dead and some MPs for him to quit, issued his second statement in 48 hours on the affair after the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said his words flew in the face of the damning conclusions of the Hillsborough independent panel.</p> <p>Within hours of the Liberal Democrat leader's intervention, Bettison issued a statement apologising if the families of the 96 who died had been upset by his remark that \"fans' behaviour \u2026 made the job of the police in the crush outside Leppings Lane turnstiles harder than it needed to be\".</p> <p>The words were included in a statement \u2013 issued after the report was published this week \u2013 in which he made clear he was staying in his post despite the independent panel report revealing more details about his key role in a South Yorkshire police internal review team condemned as a \"black propaganda\" unit.</p> <p>As his employers, the West Yorkshire police authority, began an investigation into the matters the report raised about his role, the storm grew. Asked about Bettison's position, Clegg said: \"His words were ill-judged. That is obvious. After a report like that, to suggest the fans were an impediment to the police operation when the report revealed the truth that the burden of responsibility lay with the police and other emergency agencies was insensitive and ill-judged.</p> <p>\"He will need to react pretty clearly to clarify what he meant. It flies in the face of the basic thrust of the report.\"</p> <p>Within hours, Bettison apologised. \"Let me speak very clearly,\" he said. \"The fans of Liverpool football club were in no way to blame for the disaster.</p> <p>\"I formed this clear view on hearing all the evidence that was presented at the Taylor inquiry.</p> <p>\"The evidence was overwhelming. The police failed to control the situation, which ultimately led to the tragic deaths of 96 entirely innocent people. I can be no plainer than that and I am sorry if my earlier statement, intended to convey the same message, has caused any further upset.</p> <p>\"My role was never to besmirch the fans. I did not do that. I am deeply sorry that impression and slight has lingered for 23 years.\"</p> <p>The Hillsborough independent panel \u2013 which had unprecedented access to 450,000 documents \u2013 uncovered the true scale of the South Yorkshire police cover-up, which began in the hours after the fans were crushed to death at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.</p> <p>Fresh evidence in the panel report showed 164 police statements were doctored, victims were tested for blood alcohol levels and checks were carried out on the police national computer to access criminal records in order \"to impugn the reputation of the deceased\".</p> <p>Criminal charges may now be laid against serving and former officers after South Yorkshire police set in motion a referral to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).</p> <p>The force said they were reviewing matters raised in the panel's report \"with a view to making a referral\" to the IPCC. Any referral requires them to identify officers and any offences they may have committed. Any referral would have to name officers and alleged offences \u2013 either criminal or disciplinary.</p> <p>Officers and former officers could be investigated for perverting the course of justice by doctoring statements, misconduct in public office and manslaughter.</p> <p>The current South Yorkshire chief constable has said there are 195 officers who were involved in the Hillsborough operation who are still serving.</p> <p>But there was anger and concern growing among many of those officers on Friday.</p> <p>Several serving and former officers telephoned the police federation expressing concern that they might be targeted unfairly in any investigation.</p> <p>Many, it is understood, said the dramatic revelations of the Hillsborough report had led to the trauma they suffered on the day resurfacing. Others expressed concern that they would become scapegoats.</p> <p>Neil Bowles, chairman of the South Yorkshire police federation \u2013 who was a serving officer in the force at the time of Hillsborough \u2013 said: \"The calamitous conclusions of the panel's report have only made the morale of officers which was already at an all-time low \u2026 worse. Every officer within South Yorkshire police then and since will be blamed for the sins of the past.\"</p> <p>Bowles himself was not on duty at the stadium on the day \u2013 but worked as a mortuary officer in the temporary facility for the bodies the following day. \"I worked for 14 hours there, and the feelings I had then have all returned now,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Great Britain's Tour de France stars Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome will assist Mark Cavendish in the defence of his title in next week's world road race championships in Limburg, but the coach who masterminded last year's triumph, Rod Ellingworth, says it is unlikely that the world champion will retain the rainbow jersey on the hilly Netherlands circuit.</p> <p>\"We are not thinking of getting a big result, but the guys will all have a job to do,\" Ellingworth said. \"For Cav it may well be a job earlier in the race for the team, to just get stuck in.\"</p> <p>The team will be a mix of experience and youth, with Cavendish, Wiggins and Froome joined by Luke Rowe, Alex Dowsett, Ian Stannard, Ben Swift, Steve Cummings and the climber Jonathan Tiernan-Locke.</p> <p>After last year's victory, which was several years in the making, Ellingworth is beginning to set his sights on a possible world championships on home soil in the near future, the road worlds being one of a number of events for which British Cycling is bidding. \"There's no reason why Britain wouldn't have the worlds and if we do it will be on a lumpy course like this one, so this year is about getting the lads thinking about the process,\" Ellingworth said.</p> <p>This year's hilly course, with an uphill finish on the top of the Cauberg climb, is typical of world championship courses, and Ellingworth feels that as well as giving future prospects such as Rowe, Stannard, Swift and Tiernan-Locke experience it could also suit Wiggins or Froome if either of the Tour stars feels it could be his day.</p> <p>\"I believe Brad could finish in the top 10 on this course with his best form and the right frame of mind, and if Froomie says he is up for it we will go for the best result possible, whatever that looks like. The whole priority this year for us and the riders was the Olympic Games.

Pooley has said she may take a year out after the world championships.
