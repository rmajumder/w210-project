  "<p>Andrew Mitchell faces a battle to hold on to his post as the government's chief whip after the Police Federation brought an abrupt end to a meeting with him in his West Midlands constituency and called for him to be sacked.</p> <p>Tory MPs, who believe that Mitchell's position has become untenable after he swore at armed police in Downing Street, are likely to seize on the federation's call.</p> <p>But No 10 stood by Mitchell on Friday night. David Cameron was said to be robust in his view that Mitchell had done enough to save his job by apologising to the officer concerned following the confrontation last month. The chief whip admitted swearing but denied calling the officer a pleb after he was barred from cycling through the security gates.</p> <p>The 40-minute meeting in Mitchell's Sutton Coldfield constituency, which was designed to clear the air, ended up piling more pressure on the chief whip after the police reacted furiously when he declined to accept their account of the Downing Street confrontation. The formal police account said that he swore at the police and described them as plebs.</p> <p>Ken Mackaill, the chairman of the West Mercia Police Federation, who led the delegation to the meeting, said the chief whip should resign or be sacked. \"I think Mr Mitchell now has no option but to resign. He is continuing to refuse to elaborate on what happened. His position is untenable.</p> <p>\"It was a very professional meeting. He repeated a profound apology about what he did say \u2013 that was a comment around officers being there to help them. But that is balanced with his denial of specific and precise speech recorded by police officers at the time.</p> <p>\"He has refused to tell us what he did say on the grounds he did not want to impugn police officers' integrity and start a 'fire fight with police'. Unfortunately that is exactly what happened. The question of integrity remains unresolved.</p> <p>\"In that we are no further forward it was a wasted meeting. But we did appreciate being able to talk to Mr Mitchell and put our concerns directly to him, albeit that they haven't been addressed.\"</p> <p>Mackaill declined to say whether the police who were involved in the incident have endorsed his call for Mitchell's resignation. \"We don't represent Metropolitan police officers. We are here representing officers in three police forces in this region. I know that for the officers we represent the integrity issue is a massive one for them and they want it finalised.</p> <p>\"We reached an impasse on the integrity issue and we felt it was time to draw the meeting to a close. I think Andrew Mitchell's position is untenable. If he won't resign, I don't think Mr Cameron has an option.\"</p> <p>Tory sources said that Mitchell would turn up for work on Monday morning. \"Everything is as it was before the meeting,\" one source said. \"Andrew Mitchell fully intends to be at his desk doing the job he is paid to do on Monday morning. He repeated his apology and has done so many times. He very much hopes that he is now able to draw a line under this.\"</p> <p>Cameron believes, for the moment at least, that Mitchell should stay. The Tory source said: \"The prime minister is very robust. The meeting was fairly predictable. The problem is there is always going to be a difference of opinion about what was said. It is like a road accident when there are three witnesses. Everyone agrees there was a road accident, but all the witnesses have different versions of what happened. But there are no liars. People just have different recollections. Andrew Mitchell is clear he did not use the word pleb.\"</p> <p>Tory sources are reluctant to say, even in private, why they are prepared to risk a confrontation with the federation. But some say that No 10 believes the federation, which is running a campaign against government police cuts, is behaving like a trade union.</p> <p>Mitchell is safe for the moment because the police officer on duty in Downing Street&#xa0;has accepted his apology. The Tory source said: \"The acceptance of the apology was enormously important. Andrew spoke to the officer and to the duty sergeant. It was a very friendly conversation with the officer who said it was the first time anyone had apologised in 20 years of police service. It ended on a friendly note.\"</p>",
  "<p>The White House was under intense pressure on Friday to disclose whether any senior administration officials were aware of requests for increased diplomatic security in Libya ahead of the fatal 9/11 attack in Benghazi, following Joe Biden's insistence in the vice-presidential debate that \"we weren't told\".</p> <p>The Republicans have gone on the offensive over Biden's remarks, claiming he misled the American people by claiming ignorance over security concerns in advance of the assault on the US consulate in Benghazi in which the ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed. Early on in the TV debate, the vice-president said: \"We weren't told they wanted more security; we did not know they wanted more security.\"</p> <p>Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, came under repeated questioning during Friday's news briefing about what precisely Biden had meant when he made that comment. The Romney campaign has seized upon testimony given to a congressional committee the day before the debate that suggested requests for beefed-up diplomatic security had indeed been made to the Obama administration before the 11 September attack.</p> <p>Carney said that Biden's \"we weren't told\" remark related specifically and only to the White House. \"The vice-president was speaking about himself and the president and the White House. He was not referring to the administration.\"</p> <p>Carney added that there were countless diplomatic facilities around the world and it was left to security experts in the state department to ensure adequate protection for embassy staff abroad.</p> <p>In a news conference almost exclusively dominated by the Benghazi issue, Carney tried to turn the controversy back on the Republicans by accusing Republican congress members of slashing the budget for diplomatic security \"in order to cut taxes for the wealthiest 2% in this country\". Under the budget proposal of Paul Ryan, Romney's running mate, non-military discretionary funding would be cut by 19% by 2014, which the Obama campaign has calculated would lead to a cut of $300m in embassy security.</p> <p>Carney also accused the Romney campaign of trying to \"politicise this, to turn this into a campaign issue.\" He said: \"That's a shame when we're talking about brave men and women in our diplomatic service who represent the American people.\"</p> <p>But Carney's counter-punches are unlikely to hold back the wave of questions that the Obama administration is now facing over exactly what it knew and when about requests for extra protection in Libya before the attack. The press spokesman repeatedly side-stepped questions from reporters about whether Obama had been informed about several previous threats to attack the Benghazi consulate in the days leading up to 11 September.</p> <p>\"I cannot get into the specific details of a classified briefing,\" he said, adding \"there was no actionable intelligence that suggested there would be an attack at the Benghazi facility.\"</p> <p>As the White House tried to fight back the flames of the Benghazi controversy, leading Republicans fanned them. Newt Gingrich, a failed candidate for the Republican nomination now backing Romney, predicted on CBS television Friday morning that Biden's remarks on Benghazi would \"haunt them from now until the next debate\".</p> <p>A senior Romney adviser, Dan Senor, questioned the administration's grasp of vital national security issues. He said Biden's comment had pointed to \"the larger failures of the administration to be completely transparent about the terrorist attacks in Benghazi and the security situations leading up to the attacks.\"</p> <p>Even before Thursday night's debate, pressure was mounting on the administration over whether it had done enough to protect US diplomatic staff in Libya. On Wednesday the congressional oversight and government reform committee was presented with a diplomatic cable sent on 2 August by Stevens to the state department in Washington asking for an additional 11 security personnel to be added to the rotation of 24. Though the 11 were to replace temporary security staff who were leaving, Stevens made clear in the cable that violence and terrorism were a threat amid a volatile political landscape.</p> <p>He wrote: \"Due to the level of threat in regards to crime, political violence and terrorism, post feels this is an appropriate number of LES [locally employed staff] security personnel needed to further embassy diplomatic outreach missions. Violent security incidents continue to take place due to the lack of a coherent national Libyan security force and the strength of local militias and large numbers of armed groups.</p> <p>\"Host national security support is lacking and cannot be depended on to provide a safe and secure environment.\"</p> <p>The Republican-controlled committee also heard from two former US security chiefs in Libya who testified that they had found it impossible to get the message across back home that security was a critical problem.</p> <p>Andrew Wood, former head of a US military team in Libya, told the committee that \"the security in Benghazi was a struggle and remained a struggle throughout my time there\". He added that the head of US security in the region had pushed for more people \"but was never able to attain the numbers he felt comfortable with\".</p> <p>Eric Nordstrom, the former security chief for US diplomats in Libya, said that in his view he had been fighting a losing battle over numbers in which \"we couldn't even keep what we had\". Pointedly, he said that he concluded after contact with state department bosses that \"we were not going to get resources until the aftermath of an incident\".</p>",
  "<p>The dozens of colourful bars and coffee shops in central Cork, along the banks of the river Lee, are still bustling as money flows into the city's tills \u2013 despite Ireland's precarious finances \u2013 from tourism, surrounding dairy farms and the presence of IT giants such as Apple.</p> <p>But the self-styled rebel city \u2013 harking back to its fiercely independent roots \u2013 could be about to move up a gear as it vies to become the Irish equivalent of Aberdeen and the centre of a new oil industry.</p> <p>The billionaire O'Reilly dynasty is promising to develop the country's first oilfield following new analysis of drilling results that suggests they have struck black gold in the Celtic Sea.</p> <p>Shares in Providence Resources, in which the former Irish rugby star and media magnate Tony O'Reilly is an investor and his son \u2013 another Tony \u2013 is chief executive, have soared from 180p a year ago to 686p as a result of the latest findings from its Barryroe field, off Cork, and increasing excitement about other prospects all around the coast.</p> <p>You might expect the locals to be celebrating, and certainly one middle-aged gambler, perched on a cushioned stool before a slot-machine at the Gold Rush casino on MacCurtain Street, is delighted. \"Good luck to those guys,\" she says over piped music, her eyes glued to neon dollar notes whirling in front of her. \"An oil discovery has got to be a good thing, hasn't it? It could bring jobs, which would stop all our children having to go abroad to London and Canada.\"</p> <p>But claims that the once-mighty Celtic Tiger has a chance to reinvent itself \u2013 this time as a petroleum state \u2013 are met with indifference elsewhere.</p> <p>Alan Duff, who runs the St Gabriel's Credit Union on St Patrick's Quay, around the corner from the Gold Rush, is more than well-acquainted with the debts of a hard-hit nation. He is more downbeat about the oil find.</p> <h2><strong>Petrol price</strong></h2> <p>\"It's hard to get excited about this,\" says the sharp-suited but softly spoken manager. \"You know the government have given away the leases for next to nothing and even if the oil is ever brought ashore it will not lead to a fall in the price of petrol.\"</p> <p>Out on the coast, closer to the waters where Providence has made its mark, there is also scepticism \u2013 plus worries about the impact that oil can have on the environment.</p> <p>Rory Jackson, who makes a now frugal living fixing up old yachts, says too many false dawns have been declared by the oil industry for him to get excited. \"These stories always seem to coincide with the government announcing tax increases,\" he says, pointing to punitive budget cuts to child benefit expected in December.</p> <p>The locals' reluctance to celebrate is understandable, not least because there have been some high-profile setbacks in the Irish oil and gas business, such as Ramco Energy's Seven Heads gas field producing water as well as gas at one stage. Shell has taken more than a decade to develop the Corrib gas field due to popular opposition to a pipeline route and the O'Reilly family's bid to become Ewing-type oil barons is not exactly new.</p> <p>The family have been the driving force behind the Barryroe field and its promised 100,000 barrels a day potential for almost 30 years, and have been involved with several discoveries that ultimately went nowhere.</p> <p>O'Reilly Jr acknowledges this. \"But that is why this is important,\" he says. \"My father must have sunk $60m or $70m into searching for oil and gas. Now we believe he is vindicated.\"</p> <p>Providence announced this week that its latest assessments of the Celtic Sea field indicated recoverable reserves of 280m barrels \u2013 far more than ever before and worth about \u00a320bn at today's prices.</p> <p>O'Reilly is in no doubt that this is the big one everyone had been waiting for. \"What we are announcing is the beginning of that [oil] industry. We hope there is a renaissance of international companies who come to Ireland and help us exploit our natural resources.\"</p> <h2><strong>Overtures</strong></h2> <p>O'Reilly claims he has had \"overtures\" from oil companies in Asia and America as well as Europe which are willing to share the risk \u2013 and potential $1bn (\u00a3620m) cost \u2013 of the first-phase development. ExxonMobil, the world's largest non-state-owned oil company, is already a partner with Providence at another offshore site, Dunquin in the Atlantic basin, where the two companies hope to start drilling in 2013.</p> <p>O'Reilly wants the oil to be landed in Ireland and refined locally but says a partner would be needed for this too. There is already a refinery at Whitegate, near Cork, plus a deep-water harbour that would provide a base for support vessels needed to develop the oilfield.</p> <p>But the biggest prize for Ireland would be if the Barryroe scheme develops as O'Reilly hopes \u2013 and triggers a resurgence of interest not only in the Celtic Sea but in other regions.</p> <p>Gas has been piped from the Kinsale Head field off Cork for 30 years and there have been other oil finds around the coastline, but none have been big enough to be worth developing. Now the economics have changed \u2013 as a result of higher energy prices, lower taxes and new drilling techniques \u2013 for fields such as Barryroe. \"We are leading the charge but we hope our success causes others to think about Ireland again,\" says O'Reilly. \"People are going to far-flung regions such as the Arctic, when they could be active in much more benign conditions.\"</p> <p>John Mullins, president of the Cork chamber of commerce and boss of the state-owned gas group Bord G\u00e1is, says foreign investment from IT and pharmaceutical groups has kept the region more buoyant than many others during the big economic downturn. Nevertheless, oil could help stem unemployment, which is nearly 10%. \"I'm not an expert in geology or seismology but all the information suggests quite a significant commercial find,\" says Mullins, who has already set up an oil and gas exploration group at the chamber. \"Whether it proves to be a false dawn or not, we need to be ready with partners to help.\"</p> <p>Also hoping for an oil boom is the Port of Cork. Executives there have already put forward plans for a \u20ac40m (\u00a332m) new multi-purpose terminal. This is mainly to handle containerised traffic but could be used for the oil support business, they explain. The dock managers have already received a delegation of Exxon executives.</p> <p>Foreign companies seem to be the key to much of what happens in Ireland at present. As one property manager said: \"When you talk to one of these large [overseas] firms it is like people from another planet. They are full of hope and optimism whereas locals have had so much bad news that cannot conceive anything getting better. No one in Ireland, perhaps O'Reilly aside, wants to take a risk: they're full of fear.\"</p>",
  "<p>Featuring infants and pensioners, hip-hop stars and ballet dancers, fashion editors and violinists, Chanel's <a href=\"thelittleblackjacket.chanel.com/en_GB/home\" title=\"\">Little Black Jacket exhibition</a>, now open at London's Saatchi Gallery, shows the tweed jacket in many, many guises. There are 113 in all. Styled by Carine Roitfeld and photographed by Karl Lagerfeld, every image features said jacket, but they can look completely different. The message? This is the jacket that can be worn by one and all.</p> <p>Versatility is something inherent to the philosophy of the little black jacket's creator, Coco Chanel. With the design dating back to the early 50s, the boxy shape was strikingly different to the cinched-in waist of <a href=\" http://designmuseum.org/design/christian-dior\" title=\"\">the New Look</a> in fashion at the time. Silk-lined, with pockets, and weighted so it hung just so, this was a jacket to do things in. Writing in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%253Daps&amp;field-keywords=justine+picardie+chanel&amp;sprefix=justine+pic%252Caps%252C307%20%3Chttp://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%253Daps&amp;amp;field-keywords=justine+picardie+chanel&amp;amp;sprefix=justine+pic%252Caps%252C307%3E\" title=\"\">her biography of Chanel</a>, Justine Picardie describes it as an example of how the designer advocated a \"way of dressing that was masculine in its unruffled dignity, while remaining true to its creator's idea of femininity\". This jacket showed she actually wasn't very interested in fashion. Instead, as her much-quoted adage \"fashion passes, style remains\" implies, she wanted to create clothes that could be worn for ever.</p> <p>You can imagine, then, that she would be delighted that Lagerfeld has reinvented the jacket again, for a new generation (arguably several, in fact). Taking over at the brand in 1982 (11 years after Coco died), he revitalised a dusty fashion house into something relevant again, with the archive at the centre. Coco staples such as pearls, quilting, monochrome and, of course, the jacket are grist to his mill. Chanel was associated with ladies who lunch when Lagerfeld took charge, and he deformalised it by taking apart the skirt suit, playing with the shape and constantly tweaking it over 40 years. A <a href=\"http://rdujour.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/2041ClaudiaSchifferChanelxx4.jpg\" title=\"\">young Claudia Schiffer</a> wore it on the runway in the 90s with a leather miniskirt, while <a href=\"http://chanel-news.chanel.com/en/home/2010/10/ines-de-la-fressange-tennant-back-on-the-runway.html\" title=\"\">the 80s saw the addition of power shoulders</a>.

If, in Coco's day, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Chanel_suit_of_Jacqueline_Bouvier_Kennedy\" title=\"\">Jackie Kennedy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.linternaute.com/photo_numerique/photographe/photo/de-prestigieuses-photos-de-stars-en-vente-privee/coco-chanel-et-romy-schneider.shtml\" title=\"\">Romy Schneider</a> were Chanel ambassadors, a Chanel jacket is now in the wardrobe of <a href=\"http://www.fashionablyours.net/the-biggest-style-influence-of-the-year-2011/alexa-chung-chanel-straw-bag/\" title=\"\">equivalent fashion taste-makers from Alexa Chung</a> to <a href=\"http://globalgrind.com/style/celebs-rocking-chanel-jacket\" title=\"\">Beyonc\u00e9</a>.</p> <p>Coco was, however, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Chanel\" title=\"\">her own best advertisement.</a> She wore her trademark jacket well into her dotage. Lagerfeld \u2013 ever the opportunist \u2013 draws this out in the exhibition: Roitfeld is photographed wearing the costume of the designer, complete with fabric scissors and lashings of pearls. Without the use of flashy logos, Lagerfeld has underlined something as distinctly Chanel. While the French brand might, in most people's heads, be associated with that trademark double-C logo, pearls and quilted bags, the Little Black Jacket puts the spotlight on another classic.</p>",
  "<p>The company that makes London taxi cabs has launched an <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=201210121254216106O\" title=\"\">emergency recall of 400 black cabs </a>after discovering a steering fault. It also suspended its shares and warned its financial poisition would be \"unclear\" until it had found a way to fix the fault.</p> <p>Manganese Bronze, which has been making black cabs since 1948, said it had been forced to recall the cabs and suspend all sales of its TX4 model after drivers reported serious problems with the power steering.</p> <p>The Coventry-based company - which manufactures the cabs in China - warned investors that the suspension of sales would have a \"very material and detrimental\" impact on its cash flow.</p> <p>The steering fault is just the latest problem to beset Manganese, which is 20% owned by Chinese car group Geely and has failed to turn a profit since 2007. This summer, just two days after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/12/london-2012-olympics-closing-ceremony-live#block-502826ca95cbf34442898d9f\" title=\"\">Spice Girls danced on top of five black cabs at the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics</a> the company revealed a \u00a33.9m black hole in its accounts.</p> <p>Manganese's UK sales dropped 9% last year to 1,502 taxis. The company's shares, which were suspended at 10p valuing the company at just \u00a33m has, have fallen 70% in the past year. Just five years ago, they were changing hands at more than \u00a38 each.</p> <p>It is not the first time Manganese has been forced to launch an emergency recall of the TX4 model. Four years ago it called back 5,000 of the early TX4 after some of them caught fire.</p> <p>John Russell, chief executive of Manganese Bronze, said there had been two incidences of drivers \"struggling to steer the vehicles correctly\" due to the failure of the hydraulic system that powers the steering.</p> <p>Russell said that in both incidences a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circlip\" title=\"\">circlip</a>, which holds hydraulic fluid pipes in place, had either fallen off or been damaged. \"[This means] you get very erratic performance of the hydraulic fluid in the power steering, which results in odd characteristics [to the steering],\" he said.</p> <p>In both cases the drivers had been able to wrest back control of their vehicles and, Russell said, the fault had not led to any injuries.</p> <p>He said Manganese engineers had examined the vehicles \"and came to the conclusion that we did have a problem\".</p> <p>The company immediately began the recall and some of the affected vehicles are already off the streets. Russell said all owners and drivers of affected cabs were being contacted by phone and by letter.</p> <p>Russell said he was unable to say what had caused the problem or how long it would take to fix it. \"We know that drivers aren't earning a livelihood if they can't drive. That is a real issue, and we aim to get them back on the road and earning money as soon as possible,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We are not going to have a witch hunt. We want to find a solution the root cause. Then we will discover who is to blame, and questions will get answered.\"</p> <p>However, Russell pointed out that the company had recently contracted a new Chinese company to supply its steering box. \"We firmly believed that we had a better supplier, and we went through a very thorough test evaluation,\" he said. \"We are very disappointed.\"</p> <p>He said Manganese holds a contract with the supplier that \"covers warranty and negligence, and that contract will come into play\".</p> <p>The company is also suffering from growing competition. Mercedes-Benz began selling its Vito cab in 2008 and now supplies almost a third of the capital's 22,000-cab fleet.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/nissan-reveals-new-london-taxi\" title=\"\">Nissan is also planning to break into the market next year with the launch of a modified version of minivans currently used by cabbies in New York.</a></p> <p>\"We are having a real tough time of it,\" Russell said. \"But we are one of the great British icons and so we will continue to power on.</p> <p>\"Despite various attempts to build a better taxi, no one has made a better one than ours.\"</p>",
  "<p>In August, <a href=\"http://www.trashtalkhc.com/\" title=\"\">Trash Talk</a> played a warehouse show in their adopted hometown of Los Angeles. A friend of theirs was releasing a new skate shoe line, and he wanted a band to play the launch party. \"We're not really into doing private events,\" says guitarist Garrett Stevenson, \"but we said we'd do it if we could make it a free show, just to make sure we could get in all the people who wanted to see us.\"</p> <p>Everything was going well. Fun times, rad people. But as the night drew on, the crowd outside grew, and when the band took to the stage, things got ugly. \"Right as we started playing people were rushing the doors to get in,\" says vocalist Lee Spielman. \"Then security started macing and tasering the kids who were getting in the way.\" Not that Trash Talk knew anything about it. \"The organisers cut the show short by five minutes. I was just like, 'Hey, maybe it's getting late,'\" says Garrett. \"But I went outside to have a cigarette and I was like, 'Oh <em>shit</em> \u2026 there are riot police in the street with shields, helicopters overhead, shit is <em>everywhere.</em>' I just missed a full-scale riot, and we were the last people to find out.\"</p> <p>From this, we can draw two simple but profound truths about Trash Talk: one, that their live show is a more compelling spectacle than a riot; and two, that if people are willing to risk getting tasered to get into their gig, they're probably doing something right. Trash Talk's new album, 119, backs this up. Tracks such as <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/ofwgkta-official/exile-on-broadway\" title=\"\">Exile On Broadway</a> and Uncivil Disobedience are brutal, downer takes on hardcore punk; proof that Trash Talk are not only one of the most thrilling bands operating in 2012, but also that they're working in the grand lineage of bellicose Californian punk. In the late-70s and early-80s, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jul/05/black-flag-keith-morris-formed-off\" title=\"\">Black Flag</a> and the Circle Jerks took punk rock, sped it up, laced it with suburban frustration and sold it to smalltown America from the back of a beat-up van. The DIY attitude wasn't just supplementary to the music: it informed it, engendering a spirit of personal integrity and no-compromise.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CBag0W08Zoc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CBag0W08Zoc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CBag0W08Zoc\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to view</a></p> <p>This is the spirit Trash Talk work in. Formed in Sacramento in 2005, Trash Talk network extensively, tour incessantly, record their own music, and press and distribute their records via their own Trash Talk Collective imprint. \"It came out of getting frustrated waiting on people,\" says Garrett. \"There's that point of realisation: 'Damn, this is all it costs to put out a record? Why didn't I do that in the first place?'\"</p> <p>Right now, Trash Talk are in the city of Lawrence, Kansas, where they're on tour with their friends <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all\" title=\"\">Odd Future</a>. This isn't your standard headline band, support band deal. Instead, the groups' agents booked the tours running in tandem, with Odd Future playing bigger venues and Trash Talk playing afterwards at the club a couple of blocks down the street. It's been a meeting of the tribes: punk kids checking out Odd Future, hip-hop kids getting their first taste of the moshpit. \"There's a bit of crossover, but it's fun to play to people who don't know us,\" says Garrett. \"We played Columbia, Missouri a couple of days ago. I walked outside afterwards and there were all these Odd Future fans, all like, 'I've never seen a punk band in my life \u2026 that's the craziest shit ever!'\"</p> <h2>'We built a place where we can practise, skate, make zines \u2026 do whatever we want, with our friends, on our own terms'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397652759\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349884574759/Lee-Spielman-Trash-Talk-008.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Spielman Trash Talk\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Spielman of Trash Talk on stage in Hythe, 2010.

Before long, friendship turned to collaboration. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/may/07/tyler-the-creator-odd-future\" title=\"\">Tyler, The Creator</a> directed the video to 119's lead single, FEBN, under his Wolf Haley guise, and he also performs a guest rap on the track Blossom &amp; Burn. But the real sign of the two groups' closeness is that 119 will be a joint release with Odd Future Records. It's a break from Trash Talk's DIY ethos, but the partnership feels natural. \"Odd Future handle business as a collective, a unit,\" says Garrett. \"They do everything they want to do, and if they don't want to do something, it doesn't happen. And that's exactly how we work.\"</p> <p>The album title refers to Trash Talk's living quarters, a repurposed mattress factory near the city's poverty-stricken Skid Row district. \"We wanted to get a spot that we can all live at and be creative,\" says Lee. \"We built a studio, a mini skate ramp and a bunch of lofts in there. It's a place where we can practise, skate, make zines \u2026 do whatever we want, with our friends, on our own terms.\"</p> <p>An illustration of the breadth of Trash Talk's creative enterprise is that their next release, after 119, is Trash Talk Collective: Volume Two, a 300-page hardback art book packaged with a seven-inch record. \"It's the coolest shit I've ever done, man,\" says Garrett. \"It's a mix of pictures, writing, art \u2013 we come back from tour like, 'That kid we met in Japan is an awesome fucking artist, or that guy from Portland takes killer photos \u2013 let's just press it ourselves.'\"</p> <p>It's tempting to try to inscribe political significance on to what the band do. Their track Uncivil Disobedience, introduced by Spielman's howled \"Occupy your streets!\" and dotted with lyrics about \"class war\" and \"inciting a riot\", seem to imply solidarity with the spirit of global protest. But the group deny any such simple political allegiance, with bassist and co-lyricist Spencer Pollard describing the song as being about \"the difficulties in channelling deep frustrations into peaceful movement when violent outbursts are just as easily executed and potentially more instantly gratifying.\"</p> <p>Perhaps it's more accurate to say that Trash Talk are a post-political band. For all the aggression in their music, they have a lot to say about the importance of family and friendship. The truth is that 119, the building \u2013 and by extension, the band itself \u2013 is a way to survive in a city gone feral, where punk kids live in fear of taser-happy policemen and the poor fend for themselves. \"Walk out of our house and you see tents, homeless dudes going through the trash,\" says Garrett. \"That all becomes material.\" So Trash Talk's fierce racket is just a dirty mirror directed at their environment? \"One-hundred-and-fifty per cent, man.\"</p> <h2>Punk's not dead</h2> <p><strong>Three other loud and fast bands you should hear right now </strong></p> <p><strong>SAUNA YOUTH </strong>Fleet-footed London art-punks mixing garage riffs with intellectual lyrics about the mundanity of existence.</p> <p><strong>Key track </strong><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/faux-discx/sauna-youth-psi-girls\" title=\"\">PSI Girls</a></p> <p><strong>CEREMONY </strong>For their fourth album, Zoo, these Rohnert Park punks toned down the hardcore for a sound inspired by the buzzsaw post-punk of Wire's Pink Flag.</p> <p><strong>Key track </strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6m_CbDMIdlI\" title=\"\">Adult </a></p> <p><strong>HOLOGRAMS </strong>Scruffy Swedish punks sing about Vikings and the dour concrete misery of the Stockholm projects, with added bloopy Korg synth.</p> <p><strong>Key track </strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOrRmH4azlk\" title=\"\">ABC City </a></p>",
  "<p>Many years ago when I was at college I took a part time job as a porter in a large office and conference facility. Our foreman, Kevin, had to manage and juggle an enormous number of different and often competing events and make sure each had what was needed on-time and without fuss. It was quite challenging keeping everything on track and never giving any external sign of panic! The team I worked with was great and I really enjoyed the experience.</p> <p>But beyond the laughs and the sometimes challenging logistics I recall one aspect in particular. In our tea breaks one of the guys Gary, used to doodle in a note pad. His drawings were of the most amazing quality \u2013 at least as good to my eye as anything by Steve Bell or Franklin. I asked him if he'd ever thought of taking these to the newspapers or the publishing world. He was clear that he'd have no chance because he didn't have any qualifications and that he wouldn't be given a second glance by such an employer.</p> <p>Social entrepreneurs meet so many people like Kevin and Gary \u2013 people with considerable talent, people who can organise quite complex projects or draw with real feeling and panache. But who quite simply have been let-down by school and did not have effective role models to guide them.</p> <p>We also appreciate that across the land there are millions of these people \u2013 naturally talented in a variety of ways and pretty resourceful; but uneducated. In fact there are 10 million people without a GCSE or equivalent which is 1:4 of the working population.</p> <p>This has been the case for decades but in previous times there were millions of low and semi-skilled hands-on jobs in factories, mines and shipyards that gave such people real work and a genuine opportunity to raise a family. I think the education system was complacent \u2013 it assumed that most local people would go to work in that factory and that a good education wasn't really necessary.</p> <p>But when these jobs started to disappear the system was incredibly slow in taking on the new challenge of educating people for the new world of work. Such people suffered a terrible double whammy \u2013 their local jobs gone and no up to date skills suitable for any other work. Only in the late nineties did we wake up to the challenge and start to invest heavily in our schools and in new ways of learning but we are still sending one in six children into the world with virtually no qualifications of any merit.</p> <p>I think that in effect some sort of Faustian plot was hatched \u2013 we accepted too readily that we couldn't create enough jobs for these people and that it was far too late to address their lack of skills. So we simply compensated them with benefits. Well, the pigeons have come home to roost now and we can't afford to have 30% of our working age population not working.</p> <p>This incredibly large number of non-working people sets a powerful negative example to the coming generations and trumps any new initiative that schools can deliver. With so many people not working and so few jobs available for them (and even fewer within a realistic travelling distance) it is not practical or moral to seek to reduce the burden simply through reducing individual benefits I firmly believe though that it's not too late. I believe that we can reverse years of neglect and help those who lost out twice to rebuild their lives and win back a sense of self-respect. However, it is clear that only particular people can do this work \u2013 people who believe in people and who are motivated to help others and who are patient and flexible. In other words it is social entrepreneurs who are the cutting edge of creating work for the let-down generation. As Stephen Bubb, chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.acevo.org.uk/\" title=\"\">ACEVO</a>, recently said at a fringe meeting, social enterprises just get on and employ people they don't carp about the difficulties of employing them and the cost of tribunals.</p> <p>But to do it on the scale that is needed we need to do two things: Firstly, we need to recruit more social entrepreneurs. To do this we need to work directly with those local people who do have ideas and can provide services and give them the tools to enable them to make the difference. Secondly, we need to persuade councils and businesses to buy services from social enterprises as a defined part of their general spend. My challenge therefore to government, local government and business is to spend 5% of their procurement budget in areas of high deprivation and critically with companies dedicated to creating work for the people that live there even where they if that commitment was made it would be possible to establish the businesses to meet the demand.</p> <p>We have some of the tools to help make this happen \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/3/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">Social Value Act</a> and the right to challenge to name two but we need to go so much further if we are to overcome the ingrained and ossified inertia that seems to have settled on so many of our communities.</p> <p>If we focus our attention on the millions who have been let-down then the benefits will be profound. If we can get adults back to work in areas where so many have been unemployed for years we can change an area and inspire all their children.</p> <p><em>Colin Crooks has been a social entrepreneur for 22 years and his new book </em><a href=\"http://authr.com/title/348/one-million-jobs_a-social-entrepreneur's.html\" title=\"\"><em>\"How to make a million jobs \u2013 A charter for social enterprise\"</em></a><em> is out now in all good bookstores. </em><a href=\"https://socialenterprise.guardian.co.uk/en/accounts/join\" title=\"\"><em>Sign up</em></a><em> for our social enterprise network newsletter for your chance to win a copy of Colin's book.</em></p> <p><em> </em><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Here come the blue beasts in all their nakedness. The Conservative party conference shows the emperor sans clothes, exposing a return to its traditional values: anti-welfare, pro-communities, do-it-yourself, pick yourselves up by the bootstraps policy. Or, in popular terms, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/oct/10/ten-things-conservative-party-conference?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">\"white van conservatism\"</a>. The message is a throwback to 1980s, Thatcherism and John Major's fated 'back to basics' campaign while the rest were left manage as best we could.</p> <p>Volunteerism and individuality are an important part of Tory tradition, so seems odd therefore that at the same time the \"big society\" appears to have gone west. When was the last time you heard that phrase?</p> <p>The local impact of the anti-welfare message can be glimpsed by looking at <a href=\"http://voluntarysectorcuts.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Voluntary Sector Cuts</a> online, where charities have self-reported the impact of 494 cuts during 2011-12 worth \u00a375.4m, and predict a further 33 cuts for 2012-13 will cost them \u00a31.9m. This, of course, is the tip of the iceberg, given that these figures only reflect where organisations have bothered to file details of their losses.</p> <p>So if not central government, who is going to meet the cost of localism to save us from the harsh winter of austerity? Local government is unable to pick up the slack; the government has already confirmed that council tax will be frozen for a third consecutive year, and voters are unlikely to support council tax increases after that.</p> <p>Perhaps parish and town councils, in a modest way, can tax locally to take on responsibility for some libraries and other services deemed important by local communities.</p> <p>But, as the University of Newcastle's Professor Mark Shucksmith has warned, we are stumbling towards \"a two-speed countryside\". Genuine localism includes devolving resources as well as responsibilities, with the state \"helping people to help themselves\".</p> <p>In contrast to this pure vision, the Localism Act appears be promoting self-reliance without the resources to deliver it. Its emphasis on voluntarism carries the real danger that we give more to the richest communities while taking away from the poorest.</p> <p>Academics Botes and van Rensburg argue this reinforces existing inequalities: communities with the numbers, education, resources and capability can get ahead whilst those without simply do not.</p> <p>I am appalled that red-blue policy guru Phillip Blond, director of the thinktank Respublica, is quoted as saying the \"key task for conservatism over the next two and a half years is how it can repeat what Mrs Thatcher did, which is enable a mass aspiration for entrepreneurship and ownership\". The aspiration may be there from individuals and communities, but where is the support, encouragement and resources to make it happen? It's common sense that, if you plant a seed, it will need watering to help it grow strong and productive.</p> <p>Sadly, the reality seems very different: Dave's big society house is still under construction, while the foundations are being undermined by cuts.</p> <p><em>James Derounian is principal lecturer in community development and local governance at the </em><a href=\"http://www.glos.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>University of Gloucestershire</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and the latest vacancies in your area</strong></p>"
