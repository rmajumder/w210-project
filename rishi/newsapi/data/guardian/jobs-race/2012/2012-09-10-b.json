  "<p>Good for the Republicans trying to mix it up, color-wise. Speakers at their convention last month included South Carolina Governor Nimrata \"Nikki\" Haley, whose parents emigrated from the Punjab, and Mia Love, a Haitian-American Mormon running for congress in Utah. They reached out to Latinos with New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, and to African Americans with former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Craig Romney, the nominee's youngest son, even gave a speech in Spanish.</p> <p>But a few sprinkles of chocolate and caramel don't change the overall flavour: Republicans are <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/118937/republican-base-heavily-white-conservative-religious.aspx\">still vanilla</a>. A <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/romney-and-black-voters-an-uneasy-relationship-20120827\">recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed that among African Americans</a>, Mitt Romney polls at 0%. Yes, zero. That doesn't mean absolutely no black people will vote for him: former presidential candidate and pizza king Herman Cain says he will. So do Representative Allen \"Democrats are Communists\" West, of Florida, and Texas Congresswoman Stefani Carter, who has just been named to Romney's \"Black Leadership Council.\" But the poll data mean that very, very few African Americans, fewer than the poll's 3% margin of error, support Romney. </p> <p>He does better with Latinos: between 25% and 30% (pick your poll) claim they're willing to give the ticket a whirl. Nevertheless, if the Republicans are to win in November, they will have to do it with <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/08/2012-or-never-for-gops-white-base.html\">white voters</a>. Romney's own campaign numbers gurus say he needs at least 61% of them. </p> <p>That might work \u2013 this year. But it will probably never work again. White America is shrinking. In 2012, for the first time in modern history, the majority of babies born in the US belonged to some kind of \"ethnic minority\". According to the Census Bureau, in 25 to 30 years, non-Hispanic whites will no longer make up a majority of the US population. If the Republican party continues to cling to plutocracy, misogyny, homophobia, and racial division, it will be, as President George HW Bush (surely the whitest of white men ever to occupy the White House) would say, \"in deep doo-doo\".</p> <p>South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the GOP's brighter bulbs, worries that they're \"losing the demographic race\". He told the Washington Post:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Ed Rollins, a senior strategist, agrees, calling his party \"a bunch of old white guys\", who are ignoring the way the country is heading:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We need to basically broaden the base, we need to have more women, we need to have more Latinos, we need to have more African-Americans.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Good luck, gents. Most American women are pretty keen on getting equal pay for equal work, now made easier by the 2009 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/06/republican-gender-gap-mirrors-womens-pay-disparity?newsfeed=true\">Lilly Ledbetter Act</a>. Paul Ryan, along with most Republicans in the House of Representatives, voted against it. Women also want to be in charge of their, you know, lady-parts. Yet Republican-controlled state legislatures have tripped over themselves to introduce laws forcing women seeking an abortion to undergo transvaginal ultrasounds to get, as one pious supporter called it, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/03/transvaginal-ultrasounds-coming-soon-state-near-you\">\"a window into her womb\"</a>. This year's Republican platform document declares that since \"life\" begins at the nanosecond of conception, abortion is verboten \u2013 even if the woman has been raped, even if carrying a pregnancy to term would jeopardise her health. Zygotes: good. Women wielding vaginas: bad.</p> <p>Republicans wonder why \"family values\"-loving Latinos favor godless, gay-marriage-promoting Democrats over them. Surely, it can't just be because conservatives loudly disparage Latino language and culture, denounce the Dream Act, defend the indefensible Sheriff Joe <a href=\"http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2012/07/sheriff_arpaio_struggles_to_an.php\">\"Mexicans are dirty\"</a> Arpaio, and see nothing wrong with a little racial profiling (in 2010, a California congressman confidently asserted that he could identify the undocumented <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2010/04/22/196971/rep-brian-bilbray-says-he-can-spot-illegal-immigrants-based-on-their-shoes/\">by their shoes</a>) is no reason not to sign up.</p> <p>And why are black folks so perversely resistant to joining the party of Abraham Lincoln? Could it be because it's also the party of Richard Nixon, whose \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/books/phillips-southern.pdf\">Southern Strategy</a>\" exploited fear of integration to transform the Republicans from a socially progressive (if fiscally conservative) party into a paranoid, racist-dogwhistling bunch of pro-gun, anti-science, anti-government fundamentalists whose political base is circling the wagons in the Old Confederacy? Could it be those Romney campaign ads with all the industrious white folks which state, wrongly, that Obama <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/28/rick-santorum/Santorum-Romney-claim-Obama-endging-welfare-work/\">waived the work requirement for welfare</a>?</p> <p>Or could it be the way even the so-called adults of the Republican party have tolerated and sometimes encouraged the constant birtherism of their Tea Party-infused co-religionists? Donald Trump's absurd assurances that Barack Obama's birth certificate is fake, Mitt Romney's birth certificate \"joke\", the bullfrog chorus of Republicans from John Sununu to Sarah Palin repeatedly croaking that Obama is a socialist/radical/elitist hell-bent on transforming America into France all sound like code for \"Oh God! He's a Negro!\" CNN presenter Soledad O'Brien put this to a Tea Party leader who dismissed it. She simply <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/80654.html#ixzz25oOJ0I1C\">\"doesn't believe that he loves America the way that we do\"</a>. </p> <p>Every time Republicans seem to be making at least cosmetic progress toward inclusiveness, some old white guy shows up and tears off the mask of tolerance: Clint Eastwood talking to an imaginary (though angry and profane) black man in front of millions of people; an apparently-mummified Chuck Norris and his pale wife warning that if Obama is re-elected, your children face <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/chuck-norris-warns-1000-years-darkness-obama-elected/story?id=17152039\">\"1,000 years of darkness\"</a>.</p> <p>This is what happens when you wrap yourself in the flag so tightly that oxygen can't get to your brain. This is what happens when you want to \"take America back\". Back to when?</p>",
  "<p>The number of university applicants has dropped by 8.9% over the past year, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-18768857\">according to the latest figures</a> from UCAS.</p> <p>This comes as no surprise, as many leading universities are demanding tuition fees of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/jan/04/ucas-applications-drop-tuition-fees\">up to \u00a39,000</a>. But how will this reduced competition for places affect students when it comes to the job market?</p> <p>In countries like China and South Korea college application rates are some of the highest in the world, but they also have some of the fiercest job markets. By that measure, reduced competition at an admissions level could potentially improve graduates' job prospects in the long term \u2013 but only if the number of applicants continues to drop.</p> <p>Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/Pages/Default.aspx\">Universities UK</a>, believes this is unlikely to happen. In a BBC interview earlier this year she said: \"If we look at how the dip worked in 2006, which is when tuition fees were originally introduced, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-16789295\">they did recover in subsequent years</a>.\"</p> <p>She adds: \"If you look at the number of 18-year-olds then the dip is very much less, around about 4% in terms of applicants.\"</p> <p>This may not have any measurable effect on the job market. In fact, some of the leading universities like Edinburgh, Durham and Nottingham <a href=\"http://www.ucas.ac.uk/about_us/media_enquiries/media_releases/2012/appdig30june\">enjoyed a marginal increase in applications</a> this time around, meaning their students are even less likely to profit from the wholesale dip in applicants.</p> <p>What's more, if you account for the 5.1% increase in applicants in 2011 the overall drop averages out at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/jan/31/ucas-reports-record-student-applications\">a much cooler 3.8%</a>. </p> <p>Stephen Mcaullife of the <a href=\"http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/careers/index.aspx\">Nottingham University Careers and Employability Service</a> says the drop in job applicants has been noticable. \"This time last year you would expect to have 70 graduates competing for a single job. Today that's reduced to around 60.\" </p> <p>If you examine the recruitment methods of employers today, better odds and fewer university applicants will not necessarily translate into more graduates being soaked up by major companies.</p> <p>Stephen says that every year some of the top corporations in the UK reach the end of their recruitment cycle and about a quarter of them have hundreds of vacancies that they can't fill because they can't find the right graduate.</p> <p>\"Literally thousands apply for these positions. But the employers are looking for that difference; they're looking for someone who has been involved in sports and societies, who are confident they can work in a team, who has done work with charities and within the local community.\"</p> <p>This all points to one conclusion: regardless of the level of competition, the biggest companies aren't prepared to lower their standards.</p> <p>It's not just recruiters that decide the job market, though. Widespread cutbacks, combined with the number of professionals seeking a second career after the recession, may price some graduates out of the market. </p> <p>But the demand still exists, and according to the annual <a href=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/100582830/1254_001.pdf\">High Fliers research report</a> almost half of all students cite a \"major national or international firm\" as their preferred employer after graduation. By contrast, 20% are willing to settle for a smaller or mid-size company and just 9% expressed interest in the public sector.</p> <p>One former student puts it perfectly when he says that the best option for students is to stop searching for a break and start knuckling down. Tom, an economics graduate from Manchester currently interning at HSBC, said: \"No-one should expect these [UCAS] figures to make an iota of difference when it comes to finding a job in today's economy\".</p> <p>\"You have to go into university with the mindset that the \u00a39000+ you are paying per year is a drop in the ocean compared to your salary at graduation. Unless you strive for the best and take advantage of every opportunity the university has to offer then you may as well start looking for jobs elsewhere.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>I used to work with former rough sleepers and often found myself counselling them about money problems and their fears of falling behind with the rent. Now, as chair of a <a href=\"http://www.unitetheunion.org/\" title=\"\">Unite</a> union branch for housing workers, I find myself counselling the people who work with the homeless about their own fears of losing their home.</p> <p>All housing providers are trying to find ways of saving money on their wage bills. In the case of <a href=\"http://www.onehousinggroup.co.uk/\" title=\"\">One Housing Group</a>, I took the unusual step of writing an open letter to the organisation asking it to reconsider a plan to re-employ its supported housing staff on new contracts, resulting in pay cuts of up to \u00a38,000 a year. In the wake of a four-year pay freeze, that is quite enough to tip many modestly paid families over the edge in a high-cost area such as London.</p> <p>In part, what pushed me to write the letter was the concern that staff expressed about a ruthless growth-orientated management culture which was damaging the service they provided. These people work closely with very vulnerable people and were clearly distressed at the impact the change was having on them. Talking to members, I realised how much things had changed in supported housing.</p> <p>Faced with widespread publicity, One Housing postponed its plan in August pending further negotiations. This is welcome, although its staff remain anxious about the future because the threat remains. But this isn't an isolated case. Many employers tell us in negotiations that they share our fears, but feel compelled to join in a competitive race to the bottom in order to stand a chance when bidding for new contracts.</p> <p>We frequently handle cases where staff are transferred to a new employer after a service is tendered, only to be faced with drastic pay cuts. Either the bid for the service never stacked up, or the employer seeks to boost its surplus to undercut other providers in future contract wars. Of course, commissioners are passing on government cuts but responsible providers should speak up about the concerns they express to us: safe services require decently paid staff.</p> <p>Housing providers should ask where this is leading. Under-funded services threaten to undermine the credibility of the sector. Over the last six months I have noticed a new mood of anger among support workers, including frontline managers. People who previously thought unions weren't for them have been signing up.</p> <p>These new members express disgust at executives on six-figure salaries, focused on taking business from competitors by undercutting rather than on improving services. I have repeatedly been told by frontline managers that they see executives of their own organisations among their biggest problems in providing good services.</p> <p>Unite will back these support workers, but I hope housing executives and board members \u2013 who were once prepared to speak up for vulnerable service users, even when it meant criticising government policy \u2013 will think again about their responsibilities. We want talk to responsible support providers about agreeing decent standards for the housing and care sector.</p> <p><em>Paul Kershaw is chair of Unite's housing branch</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for analysis, best practice and </strong><a href=\"http://housingjobs.guardian.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest jobs</strong></a><strong> direct to you</strong></p>"
