  "<p>It was a small point of law, well-spotted by the lawyers, but it may have changed the landscape \u2013 the equivalent of the <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/237038\" title=\"\">cloud no bigger than a man's hand</a> that grows into a storm. On Wednesday, the supreme court ruled that some out-of-time equal pay claims could come before the civil courts. It could, at last, be the moment when local authorities abandon the hopeless cause of resisting equal pay claims. It is a critical victory, but it is not the end of the war. The new battleground is the private sector, where those women who escape from lower-paid jobs are, according to <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/tucfiles/251.pdf\" title=\"\">TUC research</a>, penalised by a gender pay gap twice as big as it is in the public sector.</p> <p>Since the Equal Pay Act came in more than 40 years ago, it had seemed that the six-month cut-off point for unfair pay claims heard by employment tribunals was unbreachable. As a result, hundreds of thousands of women missed their chance of justice. The ruling that cases beyond the six-month limit could, after all, be heard in the civil court makes it possible to launch claims up to six years after leaving an employer. That delivers a deserved windfall to the low-paid cleaners, cooks and care assistants of Birmingham who retired or left before the council recognised their rights, and it also opens up the chance for thousands more women reluctant to challenge discriminatory employers while they still work for them, or in the same sector. Meanwhile, Birmingham, at a time of desperate cuts, is left with a huge bill for fighting and losing a battle it should have conceded years ago.</p> <p>The Equal Pay Act was a grand gesture in the dying days of a failing Labour government. Designing legislation that would successfully change the way people behaved was a novelty and its passage was a stitch-up between patriarchal unions and patriarchal employers. A five-year gap before implementation was meant to allow employers to equalise pay. Instead it allowed thousands of jobs to be reassigned to women only, perpetuating the undervaluation of women's work. Fighting cases is tricky, because an individual rather than a trade union or the equalities commission has to bring the case. The process was made worse by job segregation, because it made it near impossible to find a comparator to prove men got more for doing similar work. Where attempts have been made to make the law work better, they've been piecemeal: amendment on amendment, overlaid by EU law to produce something so dense that it's incomprehensible to all but specialist lawyers. Above all, the law is about providing a remedy when it has been broken, not about trying to shape the environment to encourage compliance. And when finally a serious attempt at reform was made, it again came at the end of a Labour government heading for defeat. The Equalities Act 2010 repeats its predecessor's mistakes. Its postdated proposals for pay transparency lie unimplemented and ignored by the coalition.</p> <p>Yet, although the women who marched on parliament on Wednesday<a href=\"http://ukfeminista.org.uk/events/feminist-lobby-of-parliament/\" title=\"\">under the UK Feminista banner</a> rightly protest at the distance still to travel before women are treated equally, the world is transformed since equal pay law was first introduced. Nearly as many women as men now work. The pay gap <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/economics/2012/07/were-solving-pay-gap-wrong-way?destination=node%2F187943\" title=\"\">is better understood</a>. It can be seen to be clearly linked to events in women's lives \u2013 motherhood, caring responsibilities, an interrupted work record (nearly half of all low-paid women earn even less when they return to work). And last year the pay gap for workers on median hourly pay was actually narrower than it has ever been.</p> <p>Hold the cheers. It is true that women's pay has been rising faster than men's, but that's not as exciting as it sounds. <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/economics/2012/07/were-solving-pay-gap-wrong-way?destination=node%2F187943\" title=\"\">Men's pay is static,</a> and fathers' pay has actually fallen as more men work part-time. Families are faring worse than other groups. The parent penalty is falling more equally, but that just means more children are in poverty. Affordable childcare and higher-quality part-time work are at last issues for men as well as women. A new equality is emerging, but it's an equality of misery.</p>",
  "<p>Every campaign <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/richard-adams-blog/2012/oct/24/romney-obama-october-surprise-politics-live\">fights for control over media coverage</a>. But campaigns depend on the media to get their messages out. A quid pro quo develops. Campaigns trade access for coverage. What's strange is when a campaign asks for coverage but wants the access part to be invisible. Case in point: asking for a newspaper endorsement based on an off-the-record conversation.</p> <p>President Obama agreed to speak with the Des Moines Register this week about the election and why the paper should endorse him. But then the White House made the conversation off the record.</p> <p>The story might have ended there, with the Register editors deciding to endorse without ever releasing the nature of their conversation with the president.</p> <p>But Register editor Rick Green wrote a blog post Tuesday evening about the strange stipulation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The conference call lasted nearly 30 minutes and was an incredibly informative exchange of questions, answers and an insightful glimpse into the president's vision for a second term. He made a genuine and passionate case for our endorsement and for reelection. [...]</p> <p>Unfortunately, what we discussed was off-the-record. It was a condition, we were told, set by the White House.</p> </blockquote> <p>Green's post caught the attention of Register readers and other media outlets. Speculation cropped up that the president had said something the White House did not want to be released. Questions about the off-the-record condition threatened to eclipse whatever impact an endorsement might have. There was the uncomfortable fact that Governor Romney had conducted an extensive, hour-long interview with the paper that he allowed to be filmed.</p> <p>The White House then suddenly reversed course, conceding to the newspaper's request to release details of the conversation. The paper published the transcript of the conversation online today.</p> <p>The bombshell in the transcript? No bombshell. Obama said a couple things slightly differently than he has said them before. The Huffington Post highlighted this passage about the Latino vote:</p> <blockquote> <p>Since this is off the record, I will just be very blunt,\" Obama said on a call Tuesday with the Register's publisher and editor, which was originally meant to be off the record. \"Should I win a second term, a big reason I will win a second term is because the Republican nominee and the Republican Party have so alienated the fastest-growing demographic group in the country, the Latino community.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Register will make its endorsement Saturday night.</p> <p>In 2008 the Register endorsed Obama, writing, \"Obama has earned the Register's endorsement for the presidency because of his steadfastness in the face of uncertainty, his clear-eyed vision for a more just America and his potential for rallying the country to do great things.\"</p>",
  "<p>There is little surprise that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/15/conrad-black-appear-bbc1-hignfy\" title=\"\">Conrad Black returned to London</a> this week to pursue his resurrection. Black passionately wants to get back to business and restore his social status. Sentenced in Chicago in 2007 to six-and-a-half years imprisonment for fraud and obstruction of justice, Black earned <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/21/conrad-black-released-on-bail\" title=\"\">early remission from a Florida jail</a> for good conduct and returned at the beginning of this year to his only remaining home in Toronto \u2013 he previously had four. Now he yearns to resume his life in London \u2013 not least because Canadians have shown loathing for the man who churlishly gave up his Canadian citizenship to accept a British peerage, and most are outraged that a British crook should be allowed to resume life in his Toronto mansion.</p> <p>Now it is up to the British to decide whether they will accept Black's return to the London stage.</p> <p>During his tour of London's television studios \u2013 most notably in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/23/conrad-black-adam-boulton\" title=\"\">confrontations with Jeremy Paxman and Adam Boulton</a> \u2013 Black spewed out a long-rehearsed monologue to dazzle his countrymen with professions of victimhood and demands for resurrection as a social giant fit to vote in the House of Lords and take tea in Buckingham Palace. In his carefully contrived redemptive plea, he spawns a tale of being the innocent victim of the US justice system.</p> <p>Understandably, his carpet-bombing of TV interviewers with obscure arguments confounds the public who are ignorant about the intricacies of his trial and his subsequent appeals. The facts, however, are incontestable. Black's frauds were discovered by the shareholders of Hollinger, the owner of the Telegraph group. \"You're a thief,\" one shareholder yelled during the company's annual meeting in 2001. Eventually, all his fellow directors realised that Black had lied to them about Hollinger's accounts and he had taken about $200m from the company. The US government prosecuted on 14 charges.</p> <p>The trial was staggeringly fair. Hugely damning evidence against Black was excluded by the judge. Most remarkably, having endlessly pontificated how he intended to destroy the prosecutors, Black did not testify in his own defence. Instead he propelled his hapless secretary to testify and she was slaughtered by prosecutors.</p> <p>The jury quickly found Black guilty of three counts of fraud and obstruction of justice, but then began five days of vituperative argument about whether Black's use of corporate money to pay for his honeymoon and a birthday party for his wife was criminal. On the remaining fraud and racketeering charges nine jurors believed he was crooked while three disagreed. The legacy of the blistering rows was their irreconcilable split \u2013 9 to 3. So Black was acquitted of 10 charges.</p> <p>But, as the trial judge and the subsequent appeal judges all said in open court, the evidence against Black was overwhelming. He was, the judges agreed, rightly found guilty by the jury of systematically looting Hollinger. So on appeal in Chicago his convictions were upheld.</p> <p>However, with great skill, Black appealed to the supreme court. In a complicated legal argument, he persuaded the judges to change one law about the \"honest services\" owed by a company director to his shareholders. Technically, two of the fraud convictions became \"unsafe\". But the judges stated that, as Black was so patently guilty of fraud, he should return to prison even on one count of fraud for $600,000 and obstruction of justice. The judges agreed with the jury, with Hollinger's shareholders and directors, that Black was guilty of systematic fraud.</p> <p>Disregarding the judges' universal condemnation, Black has arrived in London to assert his innocence. He states that since only two convictions out of 14 charges were upheld, he is really innocent. Spectators of Black's behaviour should not be surprised.</p> <p>Convicted fraudsters who want to stay in business obey a single rule for their future prosperity \u2013 they always protest their innocence and seek pity as the victims of vengeful prosecutors, governments or \"dark forces\". The fraudster knows that the slightest admission of guilt would permanently destroy his ambition to restore his social reputation and get back into making money. His mission of reassertion is always accompanied by cursing and trivialising an unfortunate interruption in his blessed way of life \u2013 like a damning government report, bankruptcy, or a period in jail.</p> <p>The eventual outcome of Black's mission to rise from the dead like Lazarus cannot be predicted. He follows in the footsteps of the most masterful practioner of resurrection \u2013 Robert Maxwell. The Bouncing Czech overcame universal damnation in 1971 for his dishonesty, and by 1985 was back at the hub of British politics and business.</p> <p>Throughout his life, Black has fought his critics. First, when he stole and sold exam papers at school. Then when he bought Argus, Canada's biggest conglomerate, and was accused of mismanaging the pension fund. And more recently for his conduct during a takeover bid for an American mining company that a US judge declared to be dishonest.</p> <p>After each case, Black cursed his critics as malicious and defended himself as a pillar of probity. His visit to London is just the latest in the familiar Black roadshow: \"Trust Honest Conrad \u2013 the scion of respectability\". The fireworks and his Wagnerian damnation of his critics is a familiar accompaniment to a tested performance.</p>",
  "<p>One agency in the US has the power to invade and investigate the White House: the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Its extraordinary powers make it the closest thing the country has to a secret police. With the intelligence at its command, the FBI can make presidents, and break them.</p> <p>Information is power; secret information is power squared. And eyes-only intelligence secured for the president \u2013 or against him \u2013 is the political equivalent of a nuclear warhead. Its mere possession is sufficient to deter an enemy, and the FBI's J Edgar Hoover had an arsenal unsurpassed in the annals of 20th-century America. Forty years after his death, the FBI still has that power, along with the keys and codes to unleash it. It was the FBI that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/watergate/part3.html\" title=\"toppled President Richard Nixon\">toppled President Richard Nixon</a>, made felony cases against President Ronald Reagan's national security team, and withdrew the blood and the DNA from President Bill Clinton that brought him to impeachment for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUDppdVXeMw\" title=\"lying about sex\">lying about sex</a>.</p> <p>The FBI has been with us for 104 years, and for much of the past century its relationships with presidents have been marked by a ferocious tug-of-war. Only in the past three years, under Obama, has a delicate balance between national security and civil liberties approached equilibrium. No other Democratic president has been free of the fear of the power of the FBI since Lyndon B Johnson took office in 1963. Harry Truman worried aloud that the Bureau would become an \"American Gestapo\". John F Kennedy knew Hoover had 20-year-old sex tapes of his liaison with a suspected Nazi agent, and he shared his national security adviser's opinion that Hoover was \"a goddamned sewer\", collecting and disseminating dirt. But most presidents have taken pleasure in using the FBI as a sword and a shield to protect and defend their powers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV316AC_YfI\" title=\"Franklin D Roosevelt gave J Edgar Hoover the power\">Franklin D Roosevelt gave J Edgar Hoover the power</a> to eavesdrop, plant hidden microphones, and purloin secrets through burglary. When the Supreme Court outlawed telephone wiretaps, Roosevelt told Hoover, in so many words, to hell with the court. He relished the political intelligence and the unsavoury scuttlebutt that Hoover brought him. He knew that secret agents can be scofflaws; yet their techniques are useful against terrorists.</p> <p>When Hoover ruled the FBI \u2013 as he did for 48 years, until his death in 1972 \u2013 he was confounded by the American electorate only once. After Roosevelt died in office, near the end of the second world war, Hoover, like his fellow Americans, assumed the Republican candidate, Thomas Dewey, would defeat President Truman in November 1948. Dewey, who had made his name as a crime\u2013fighting prosecutor, would have been the first rock-ribbed conservative elected to the White House in 20 years. Hoover was working behind the scenes to support Dewey, who shared Hoover's views on the national emergency confronting the US in the early days of the cold war.</p> <p>The autumn of 1948 was a dangerous moment in American democracy. As the civilian leader in the war on communism, Hoover was no longer obeying the president. \"He wasn't taking orders from Truman or anybody else,\" said Stephen Spingarn, an army counterintelligence officer serving as a White House adviser. Hoover sought sweeping national security powers over law enforcement and intelligence, sufficient to make him a secret police tsar. The White House pushed back. \"That was contrary to our whole tradition,\" Spingarn said. \"You did that in communist and fascist countries, but you don't do that in the United States.\"</p> <p>Hoover wanted to detain thousands of politically suspect American citizens in the event of a crisis with the Soviets. The broad outlines of Soviet espionage in the US were beginning to come clear; Stalin's spies had stolen American atomic secrets. Hoover now drew up plans for the mass detention of political suspects in military stockades: a secret prison system for jailing American citizens, including the suspension of the ancient writ of habeas corpus. Hoover's national security assistant, Mickey Ladd, began working out the details for an American Guant\u00e1namo in October 1948. The FBI and the army would hold the detainees at military bases in and around New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The FBI, the CIA, and army intelligence officers would share the duties of carrying out the thousands upon thousands of interrogations.</p> <p>Truman looked powerless and politically spent as the election approached. Travelling on a long whistle-stop campaign, with the election four weeks away, he caught a glimpse of a Newsweek magazine poll of America's 50 most prominent political reporters. Their unanimous prediction: Dewey defeats Truman. Hoover went to sleep on election night confident in the outcome. But at 11.14am on Wednesday, 3 November 1948, the bulletin went out across the world: Truman had won the biggest upset in the history of the American presidency. A shift of only 33,000 voters in California, Illinois, and Ohio would have given Dewey victory. When Hoover heard the news, he left his desk at FBI headquarters and did not come back for two weeks. He simply disappeared.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398289882\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351091990605/John-F-Kennedy-with-J-Edg-008.jpg\" alt=\"John F Kennedy with J Edgar Hoover in 1961\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President John F Kennedy (left) considered FBI chief J Edgar Hoover (right) 'a goddamned sewer'. Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hoover would not let that happen again. He served to ensure the election of Lyndon B Johnson, his long-time Washington neighbour, their friendship bonded over sips of Jack Daniel's and backyard barbecues. Johnson loved secret intelligence; he craved it as he did whisky and cigarettes.</p> <p>After the assassination of President John F Kennedy, both men feared that his brother, Attorney General Robert F Kennedy, would seize the fallen mantle. Hoover hated Bobby Kennedy with a passion and ceased to communicate with him. Though the attorney general was his titular superior, Hoover effectively cut off his supply of information and power, ending the possibility that Kennedy could command the Democratic party.</p> <p>Then an FBI intelligence operation in the Deep South provided Johnson with essential political ammunition for his election. Johnson was furiously pushing civil rights legislation that would allow black Americans the right to vote and deny racist senators the ability to block them from the polls. He needed to destroy the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan\" title=\"Ku Klux Klan\">Ku&#xa0;Klux Klan</a>, which was murdering civil rights&#xa0;workers, blowing up black churches, and ruling by fear throughout the South.</p> <p>On 2 July 1964, Johnson ordered Hoover to go to Mississippi and proclaim the omnipotence of the FBI. The director was dubious; he thought the civil rights workers, not the racists, were the primary problem. \"Whatever you do, you're going to be damned,\" Hoover said. \"Can't satisfy both sides.\" Then he got a direct order from the president. \"Ain't nobody going to damn you,\" said Johnson, who was secretly taping the telephone call. \"Ain't anybody in this country has the respect you have.\"</p> <p>Johnson knew how to twist Hoover's arm: \"Now I don't want these Klansmen to open their mouths without your knowing what they're sayin'. Now nobody needs to know it but you, maybe, but we ought to have intelligence on that state \u2026 I want you to have the same kind of intelligence that you have on the communists.\"</p> <p>Johnson was telling Hoover to go after the Klan in language he understood. Hoover obeyed. He would subvert them and sabotage them, so long as Johnson commanded that it be done. The FBI broke the Ku Klux Klan like dry twigs. The civil rights laws were passed, and Johnson won in a landslide, with the votes of millions of white liberals and newly enfranchised black citizens.</p> <p>Days before he left office, Johnson told his successor, Richard M Nixon: \"If it hadn't been for Edgar Hoover, I couldn't carry out my responsibilities as commander-in-chief \u2013 period. Dick, you will come to depend on Edgar. He is a pillar of strength in a city of weak men.\"</p> <p>Hoover had helped Nixon gain power from 1947 onward, feeding him secret intelligence on American communists such as <a href=\"https://files.nyu.edu/th15/public/home.html\" title=\"Alger Hiss\">Alger Hiss</a>. But Hoover died in May 1972, and six weeks later, Nixon's henchmen were arrested breaking into the offices of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate hotel. They had burglary tools and a gadget that the police thought was a bomb disguised as a smoke detector: it was a sophisticated electronic eavesdropping device. The suspects had crisp $100 bills and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZUQ6hKmwkI\" title=\"Watergate hotel\">Watergate hotel</a> keys in their pockets. Their ringleaders were Gordon Liddy, a former FBI agent, and Howard Hunt, a former CIA officer. The FBI quickly determined that both men worked for the president.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398289883\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351092617991/J-Edgar-Hoover-and-Richar-008.jpg\" alt=\"J Edgar Hoover and Richard Nixon \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hoover (right), who helped Richard Nixon (left) gain power, was dead by the time Nixon clashed with the FBI over Watergate.

He recognised Liddy's name; he had met him at the FBI a decade before. When he heard that the burglars had been caught with eavesdropping equipment, he immediately opened a case under the federal wiretapping statutes. At about four in the afternoon, his secretary answered the phone and told him the White House was calling.</p> <p>\"This is Agent Supervisor Dan Bledsoe,\" he said. \"Who am I speaking with?\"</p> <p>\"You are speaking with <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/watergate/johnehrlichan.html\" title=\"John Ehrlichman\">John Ehrlichman</a>. Do you know who I am?\"</p> <p>\"Yes. You are the chief of staff there at the White House.\"</p> <p>\"That's right. I have a mandate from the President of the United States,\" Ehrlichman said. \"The FBI is to terminate the investigation of the break-in.\" Bledsoe was silent.</p> <p>\"Did you hear what I said?\" Ehrlichman thundered. \"Are you going to terminate the investigation?\"</p> <p>\"No,\" Bledsoe said.</p> <p>\"Do you know that you are saying 'no' to the President of the United States?\"</p> <p>\"Yes,\" the FBI agent replied.</p> <p>The FBI investigated the break-in. Nixon's resignation came two summers thereafter.</p> <p>Fast-forward 40 years: the White House, 12 March 2004.</p> <p>The FBI director, Robert Swan Mueller III, who had taken office on 4&#xa0;September 2001, walked into the Oval Office with a handwritten letter of resignation in his breast pocket. He had determined, along with the attorney general, that the electronic-eavesdropping programmes created in great secrecy by President George W Bush after the 9/11 attacks had violated the constitution's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. He would not consent to their use unless the president scaled them back to the boundaries of the law.</p> <p>Mueller told Bush face-to-face that he would resign if the FBI was ordered to continue warrantless searches on Americans. Both men had sworn upon taking office to faithfully execute the laws of the US. Only one still held to his oath.</p> <p>Bush promised to put the programmes on a legal footing. This did not happen overnight. It took years. But he backed down. Mueller has never breathed a word of what happened at the White House. But he is an exemplar of what the FBI must do every day.</p> <p>The man who was then the acting attorney general, James Comey, later described what Mueller had heard from Bush: \"If we don't do this, people will die.\"</p> <p>\"You can all supply your own 'this',\" Comey said. \"'If we don't collect this type of information' or 'If we don't use this technique' or 'If we don't extend this authority.' It is extraordinarily difficult to be the attorney standing in front of the freight train that is the need for this,\" Comey said. \"It takes far more than a sharp legal mind to say 'no' when it matters most. It takes moral character. It takes an ability to see the future. It takes an appreciation of the damage that will flow from an unjustified 'yes'. It takes an understanding that, in the long run, intelligence under law is the only sustainable intelligence in this country.\"</p> <p>The FBI today is still calibrating the balance between liberty and security. Barack Obama, a Democrat grounded in civil liberties, and Mueller, still the civilian commander of domestic security, are two very different men who <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-seeks-extension-for-robert-mueller-as-fbi-director/2011/05/12/AFdmE8zG_story.html\" title=\"manage to see eye-to-eye\">manage to see eye-to-eye</a>. Mueller, born to wealth and privilege, joined the US Marines and led troops in combat at the height of the war in Vietnam, where he was decorated for valour. Marine officers follow a code: if your troops go up the hill, you go up the hill. Over the past decade, Mueller has led his agents to believe they must fight the threat of terrorism without trampling civil rights. By and large he has succeeded. Mitt Romney and the Republicans have thus far failed to credibly attack Obama's right flank on issues of national security. In this way, the FBI has protected the power of the&#xa0;president.</p> <p>Obama and Mueller have never clashed on any significant issue of counterterrorism or civil liberties. The two men meet most mornings in the White House; unlike the presidencies of Clinton and Jimmy Carter, the discourse is not a dialogue of the deaf. Obama, who never came on to the FBI's radar until he started running for the White House, is intensely attuned to the difference between existential threats and idle chatter; 99% of what US intelligence hears is the latter. Mueller works on the same wavelength; he spent much of his first five years in office after the 9/11 attacks trying to filter out raw intelligence reporting that led the FBI to investigate pizza deliverymen and delusional sociopaths. The focus on analysing actual threats from potential terrorists has reduced the fear factor in daily political discourse, both at the White House and on the 24-hour ravings on the airwaves at Rupert Murdoch's Fox and its affiliates.</p> <p>The balance between national security and civil liberties remains delicate. The authors of the constitution foresaw this struggle 10 generations ago. A free people must have both security and liberty. They are opposing forces, yet we cannot have one without the other. Mueller has said we will not win the war on terrorism if we lose our freedoms in the battle. He knows Americans will surrender guarantees of liberty for promises of security. They may feel more safe, but they will be less free. He&#xa0;lives each day in this state of continual conflict. We all do. No free republic in the history of&#xa0;civilisation has survived for more than 300 years.</p> <p>\u2022 Tim Weiner is the author of Enemies: A History of the FBI (Allen Lane, \u00a325/$30), out now.</p>",

No radio station in the world would ever play it and no charming, home-edited tributes exist on YouTube. This is a hellishly intense, deeply disturbing record that deserves a (somewhat) wider audience. But first, prepare yourself; there is no vintage nightclub weirdness or religious hippydom, no oddball psych-pop or far-flung folk here \u2013 there is only immense, dissonant noise and unwavering ear-punishment. This is a brutal record, but there is, I think, a strange sort of cleansing among all the flames. </p> <p>White Dog are a five-piece from Austin, Texas and New York and have been together since 2009. Their online biog says they focus on \"improvisation, trash, dirt, broken pedals, pawn shop saxophones and the worship and love of the mistake and the accidental\". That might all be true, what it means in real life is a track like Sarcophagus of Fat has at least three separate instruments looped in screaming feedback drones that shift almost imperceptibly from left to right before a death knell finally silences them. RiboOf Tanit (she was the Phoenician goddess of the moon) has two wildly out-of-tune guitars that battle for control of the upper-end of your hearing threshold then melt into a colossal noise-soup, while Ankled Acidic Mire is a percussive, screaming wall of throat-bursting terror.</p> <p>Not for every day, and not for everyone, but as an aural exciter, a way to prepare the ear for other, perhaps less catastrophic sounds, it's second to none.</p>",
  "<p>This is the perfect bedtime story for children afraid of the dark. </p> <p>Everything about this book is beautiful. The story is very much like a lullaby and the sumptuous illustrations compliment the story perfectly. Mya loved looking for the patch of black in each picture. There is lots of detail in the pictures so lots to look at and enjoy. </p> <p>The pace of the story is great for winding down at bedtime. It also gets Mya to think about the darkness in a positive way with the help of mermaids, pirates, dragons, castles, kings and queens, rainbows, clouds, jungle animals and even a chocolate money tree! </p> <p>The story ends when the girl pictured in the story wakes up to find a world full of light and the dreams drift away. </p> <p>I can't recommend this book highly enough, it really is a perfect bedtime read.</p> <p>We both love it!</p> <p><strong>If you would like to become a family reviewer, email us at <a href=\"mailto:\" childrens.books@theguardian.com\"\">childrens.books@theguardian.com</a></strong></p>",
  "<p>Forty-six per cent of Syria's buildings are illegally constructed, according to a government study in 2007 \u2013 and this includes the homes in which more than half the population live. The problem was mostly seen around the large cities but, amid a widening gap between rich and poor, the authorities generally turned a blind eye to it.</p> <p>Particularly since this summer, though, they have been bulldozing illegal buildings \u2013 but only in restive areas. In other areas, the authorities have been selective in their demolition orders. The campaign against illegal construction is thus being used to send a message: if you rebel against the regime, you will no longer enjoy the favours bestowed by it.</p> <p>A further complication is that officials also accept hefty bribes from internally displaced people to allow them to use abandoned or partly demolished buildings. Additionally, the regime's militias and rank-and-file officers are raiding houses, ransacking and then fraudulently selling or leasing them.</p> <p>Besides adding to people's suffering amid the current conflict, these practices are reshaping neighbourhoods across the country, from large cities to small villages \u2013 which is a recipe for future clashes between the old and new owners. Many will feel their properties have been usurped by other people or bought cheaply and at some point may try to retake them.&#xa0;</p> <p>Mona, 37 years old, used to live with her five children in a flat under construction in Adra,&#xa0;about 24km east Damascus where low-income workers and military personnel live. Earlier this month, five intelligence officers raided her flat and asked her to leave.&#xa0;</p> <p>Adra has been a destination for displaced people from other restive areas, like Douma, Harasta, and Dhumair. Hundreds of families have moved there, some of them sleep in the streets and others have occupied buildings under construction.&#xa0;</p> <p>Hussain al-Ali, a 68-year-old man in Adra, was threatened by a member of the \"local committees\" \u2013 pro-regime groups of local residents to protect their own areas \u2013 to be evicted from his flat if he does not continuously stay in it.&#xa0;</p> <p>Pro-government committees control many buildings in those areas, according to Mohammed Hamdan, a blogger from Damascus. They claim the flats are being used for humanitarian purposes but in reality they use them to earn money from displaced people.</p> <p>Racan Alhoch, an activist from Damascus's Midan neighbourhood, told me: \"If a home was abandoned, the Assad army would enter it, ransack it, take what they find and label it the home of a traitor.\" Alhoch added that there were incidents of regime's militias selling a property to more than one buyer, only for buyers to find out the property was to be demolished.</p> <p>Alawite residents in Damascus are said to be selling their properties in the outskirts, including in the neighbourhoods of Mazza-86 and Tadhamun, and moving back to their old villages. These residents had originally moved from their villages in the country's middle and western region to illegally constructed houses in Damascus after President Assad's father took power. Buyers, however, are reluctant to purchase these houses fearing the owners will retake them if the regime does not fall.&#xa0;</p> <p>There has been a tendency to buy properties from people escaping the violence for extremely cheap prices, according to Alhoch. \"These wealthy men are going to sit on these properties until post-revolution then sell them for profit which gives us a whole slew of issues to deal with in post-revolution [Syria],\" Alhoch said.</p> <p>More than 800 flats have been occupied by non-owners in Damascus, according to an official. A similar scenario is playing out in Aleppo, where displaced people have illegally occupied 1,800 flats owned by the government's housing authority.&#xa0;Also, many people from Aleppo's countryside moved to the city and occupied deserted buildings.</p> <p>Other complications include proving ownership when refugees outside the country return, considering that many had left in haste without carrying their belongings with them. And people currently exploiting violence to buy properties cheaply are already being labelled as war beneficiaries.</p> <p>The issue of displacement in general is among the legacies that Syrians will have to deal with far into the future, from the displacement of Kurds by the regime in the 1970s to the ongoing practices that are being overlooked by the regime. As the violence continues in Syria, the issue is likely to deepen. And the consequences remain to be seen.</p>"
