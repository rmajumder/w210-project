  "<p>The body of 12-year-old Tia Sharp was found wrapped in a black bedsheet in a black bag in the loft of her grandmother's house, it has emerged.</p> <p>Separately, Stuart Hazell, the 37-year-old man accused of her murder, was remanded in custody as he was sent for trial at London's Old Bailey after appearing before Camberwell Green magistrates via videolink.</p> <p>Wearing a blue T-shirt, he was seated at a table in Sutton police station during the five-minute hearing. A policewoman stood behind him throughout.</p> <p>Hazell, the partner of Tia's grandmother Christine Sharp, 46, is charged with the murder of the schoolgirl on a date between 2 and 11 August.</p> <p>He confirmed his name, date of birth and address at The Lindens, New Addington, south London. He gave no plea. When asked by the clerk of the court if he understood the charge, he replied: \"Yes. I do\".</p> <p>He will appear before the Old Bailey by videolink on Wednesday and a plea and case management hearing is set for 19 November.</p> <p>Details of the case were not opened in court as the chairman of the bench, Charu Joglekar, said it was an indictable offence and magistrates did not have jurisdiction. No family members attended the brief hearing.</p> <p>Tia's body was discovered on Friday afternoon in the terraced council house where her grandmother lived with Hazell. Hazell was arrested several hours later in a field in nearby Merton.</p> <p>The schoolgirl, who regularly visited her grandmother, was reported missing on Friday 3 August. Police had visited the premises frequently since then.</p> <p>A specialist team searched the house in the early hours of Sunday 5 August and apparently examined the loft where Tia's body was discovered five days later by another team.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police has apologised to Tia's mother, Natalie Sharp, 30, saying that human error was to blame for their failure to find her body sooner. That failure is now the subject of an internal Metropolitan police inquiry.</p> <p>The cause of Tia's death has not yet been established but it is understood that police are examining a theory that she may have been smothered. A postmortem examination was halted on Saturday night and is expected to recommence this week. Although officers await formal identification of a body found at The Lindens on Friday, the alleged victim is named in the murder charge as Tia Sharp.</p> <p>More than 100 officers were drafted in to search for the missing schoolgirl. Friends, neighbours and members of the local community carried out their own searches and handed out thousands of leaflets bearing Tia's photograph.</p> <p>Christine Sharp, Tia's grandmother, was arrested on suspicion of murder on Saturday but bailed on Sunday until October.</p> <p>Her neighbour Paul Meehan, 39, was bailed on suspicion of assisting an offender.</p> <p>Tia's mother, Natalie Sharp, and her partner, David Niles, 29, who live 10 miles away in Mitcham, Surrey, visited a shrine of hundreds of flowers and cards on the pavement near The Lindens on Sunday. The couple left a white orchid, a teddy bear and a card before Sharp was led away sobbing.</p> <p>Tia's natural father, Steven Carter, who lives in Northampton but came to London to help with the search, said he would miss her for ever. He told ITV News: \"I'm heartbroken, angry, robbed. Robbed of my beautiful little girl who I will never see again, hold, kiss, touch. I don't know what to say \u2026 I want justice for my daughter \u2013 the proper way.\"</p> <p>Of the last time he saw Tia, he said: \"She jumped in my arms, she told me she loved me, we spoke about her school, what she was doing \u2026 she called me Daddy. I'll miss her forever.\"</p> <p>Detectives examined more than 800 hours of CCTV footage and received more than 300 calls to the incident room during the search with 60 reported sightings.</p>",

Instead, it most resembles a group of birds it is only distantly related to. Which group of birds is this bird often mistaken for? Can you identify this mystery bird's taxonomic family and species? For extra smug points, can you tell me which of the two subspecies this bird is and where the two subspecies are located in relation to each other?</p> <p><strong>Response:</strong> This is an adult white-necked myna, <em>Streptocitta albicollis</em>, a member of the starling and myna family, Sturnidae. As you can see from the photograph, this bird has a superficial resemblance to magpies, which are distant relatives that are placed into Corvidae (crows, jays and magpies). </p> <p>The white-necked myna has black upperparts that are iridescent purple-blue and a broad white collar that covers the mantle and breast. The legs are black, as is the very long, graduated tail. The head is glossy purple-black with a short crest, and black bill has a yellow tip in the nominate subspecies, <em>S. a. albicollis</em>, from southern Sulawesi, which the northern subspecies, <em>S. a. torquata</em>, lacks. The irides are brown and the eye is surrounded by bare black skin. Sexes and juveniles are similar, although juvenile <em>albicollis</em> have less yellow on the bill. </p> <p>So convincing is this bird's resemblance to magpies, it was originally placed into the magpie genus, <em>Pica</em>. The white-necked myna has one other equally-confusing close relative, the bare-eyed myna, <em>S. albertinae</em>, its only congener. Together, these two species may form a superspecies complex. Both taxa are endemic to Wallacea. </p> <p>The white-necked myna is a resident frugivorous songbird that is endemic to primary and secondary lowland forests on Sulawesi and on some of the smaller nearby islands in Indonesia. It also consumes a variety of invertebrates and occasionally will eat small vertebrates -- mostly lizards. Little is known about this species' natural history but this cavity-nesting species prefers holes in dead trees and is probably monogamous. These birds tend to live in pairs or small groups although it will join mixed species flocks to feed. </p> <h2>The Mystery Birds reference library:</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/may/12/2\">Africa</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/aug/11/9\">Antarctica</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/may/05/6\">South and Central America</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/apr/28/6\">Oceania and the South Pacific Ocean</a></p> <p>.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. </p> <p>You are invited to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/punctuated-equilibrium/mystery-bird\">review all of the daily mystery birds</a> by going to their dedicated graphic index page. </p> <p>If you have bird images, video or audio files that you'd like to share with a large and (mostly) appreciative international audience here at <em>the Guardian</em>, feel free to contact me to learn more. </p> <p>.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. </p> <p>twitter: @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GrrlScientist\">GrrlScientist</a> <br>facebook: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/grrlscientist\">grrlscientist</a> <br>evil google+: <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/111331532997434679580/posts\">grrlscientist</a><br>email: grrlscientist@gmail.com</p>",
  "<p>Black Heart Blue is, in my opinion, a beautifully written book, with an intricately developed and simply tantalising plot. </p> <p>The novel follows the lives of twin sisters, Hephzibah and Rebecca. They may be identical in genes but they're completely different in personality - and looks, with Hephzi being the beautiful one, and Rebecca having a disfigurement, which leads to her life being considerably worse than her sister's. </p> <p>However both girls struggle to cope with life, living with their fundamentalist Christian parents, who abuse the children, particularly Rebecca, in ways beyond imaginable. But when the girls start college, they get a taste of freedom - only a taste however, for the sisters' father is determined to prevent his daughters from leading the lives they want to lead. </p> <p>Black Heart Blue deals with some complex issues such as child abuse, rape, love and death. At the start of the novel we are told about Hephzi's mysterious death and I enjoyed reading the book to try and find out why and how Hephzi had died. </p> <p>The book is told from two different points of view: Rebecca tells the story in the present tense, after her twin sister dies whilst Hephzibah tells about her own life, obviously before her death. </p> <p>Despite the book being quite simple in language I think the messages and themes within the story are portrayed effectively, although at times, I did feel that the author had incorporated too many really complex ideas into the story, therefore not spending enough time to develop each theme. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Black Heart Blue has a lot of twists and turns, so hop on the roller-coaster if you dare and enter the world of Rebecca and Hephzibah!</p> <p>Want to tell the world about a book you've read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site </a>and send us your review!</p>"
