  "<p>Thrice winner of BBC Folk's best group award, <a href=\"http://www.lau-music.co.uk/index.php\" title=\"\">the Scots trio</a> deserve their garlands. On this third album, they again transmute traditional elements \u2013 drones, reels, highland melodies \u2013 into elegant chamber folk whose orchestral richness far exceeds the normal limits of fiddle, accordion and guitar. Northern shores provide inspiration for soundscapes such as Far From Portland and Torsa that move between drama and contemplative serenity, but an undertow of electronica is also in play, shaped by new producer <a href=\"http://www.florarecording.com/\" title=\"\">Tucker Martine</a>. Tricky time signatures, woozy Wurlitzer and a clutch of enigmatic songs from <a href=\"http://www.krisdrever.com/\" title=\"\">Kris Drever</a> further add to an innovative, beautifully realised album.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Archery: Brown back with a silver </strong></h2> <p>Already the first disabled archer to represent her country at the Commonwealth Games, the Paralympic gold medallist Danielle Brown went further when she became the first disabled archer to take part in an able\u2011bodied World Cup grand final. Putting in an outstanding performance, she won silver in the individual compound in Tokyo on Saturday.</p> <p>Brown, who won gold medals at the Paralympic Games in both Beijing and London, was invited to take part after Venezuela's Olga Bosch had to pull out. She beat Britain's Mel Clarke in the final this summer and has since been honoured with a gold postbox but had not been expecting to take part in Japan.</p> <p>\"After the Paralympic Games, I put my bow away, and was expecting to take it easy for a couple of weeks,\" she said. \"Then I got a call from World Archery inviting me over to Japan, and the bow was back out in a flash.\" She beat Marcella Tonioli and Christie Colin, the archers ranked two and three in the world, before losing in the final by just one point to American Jamie Van Natta.</p> <h2><strong>Cycling: Zanardi to race again?</strong></h2> <p>Alex Zanardi, who won two golds and a silver medal at the Paralympic Games, is in discussions to return to motor racing after the acclaim he received in the wake of his London success.</p> <p>The 45-year-old, who lost his legs in an accident in 2001, won two Cart titles with Chip Ganassi Racing and team chief Ganassi is keen for him to return in the IndyCar series. \"To have him there would be one thing; to have a Paralympic gold medallist is another,\" he said. \"But to have somebody with his personality and all those wrapped up in one would be a team's dream.\"</p> <p>Jimmy Vasser, who drove with Zanardi at Ganassi, confirmed that the Italian said he wanted to race at the Indy 500 next year, while BMW are also in talks with the driver over a drive in 2013.</p> <h2><strong>Early start for Rio</strong></h2> <p>A great chance to see potential Olympians in action amid the thrill of a live velodrome again at the British Track Championships in the National Cycling Centre, Manchester, from Wednesday.</p> <p>Lucy Garner, the 2011 junior road race world and European champion and the 2012 junior team pursuit European champion will be racing, as well as Jon Dibben, who won silver in the omnium at the junior track world championships.</p> <p>That these are serious pointers for Rio cannot be underestimated, it was at this very point after the Beijing games that London medallists Lizzie Armitstead and Joanna Rowsell sprung to prominence.</p> <h2><strong>Athletics: London's last medal</strong></h2> <p>The New Zealand shot putter Valerie Adams finally received her Olympic gold medal this week in the wake of Belarus's Nadezhda Ostapchuk being stripped of her title after failing a dope test. Fireworks and the national anthem accompanied 2,500 fans and a London medallist guard of honour on Auckland's waterfront for the ceremony.</p> <p>Adams, who also won gold in Beijing, intends to defend her title again in Rio but felt for the moment she could finally relax. \"It's been a very humbling evening and it's been one hell of a year,\" she said. \"My party starts now.\"</p>",
  "<p>There was frustration for Britain's Olympic gold and silver medallists Nicole Cooke and Emma Pooley in Saturday's world championship women's road race at Valkenburg in the Netherlands as both riders were unable to match the power of the Olympic champion Marianne Vos and her Dutch team-mates.</p> <p>Pooley was close to Vos when she made her move on the course's main climb with 48km of the 128km race remaining, but she looked to have been blocked by another rider as the Dutchwoman rode away. Vos bridged a gap to an earlier move, whittling that down to a five-strong group of escapees who dominated the latter stages of the race, opening a substantial gap on the main&#xa0;pack.</p> <p>On the final climb Vos sprang away from her companions, crossing the line alone to emulate Cooke, the only woman to have won the world title and Olympic gold in the same year, back in 2008.</p> <p>At the line, Vos had time to snatch a Dutch tricolour from a supporter, waving it high as she clinched the victory from Australia's Rachel Neylan. It was a doubly sweet victory coming as it did after a run of five second places in the event. Pooley crossed the line 15th, 4min 37sec behind Vos.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, the British cyclist David Millar, a leading campaigner against doping in the sport, said that the US Anti-Doping Authority's investigation of the seven-times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong \"could end up being the best thing for cycling\". He added: \"I really do believe that. It's a positive in the long run. We will no longer have these shadows lurking in the background and this confusion.\"</p> <p>Millar, who was close to Armstrong early in his career, said he did not believe the American would ever confess to using banned substances, in spite of a recent Usada ruling which stripped him of his seven Tour titles.</p> <p>\"It's unfortunate for him,\" said Millar. \"He's too far in. Just the scale of him, the legal problems would be massive. That's sad: he's a phenomenal athlete, no matter what happened. And now he has to live with this for the rest of his life without having it clarified.\"</p> <p>The Scot, a member of the World Anti- Doping Agency's athletes commission, spoke out against calls for an amnesty for cyclists with a doping past. \"If you did something wrong, there needs to be some culpability,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We can't just say: 'Let's draw a line now,' and pretend nothing happened in the past because things happened in the past. We have to accept where we've been and where we are now, that's the only way to move forward.\"</p> <p>Millar, who won a stage in this year's Tour de France, has already finished his season and was present at the world championship to perform commentary duties for the BBC.</p> <p>In Sunday's men's road race Mark Cavendish will wear No1 as the defending champion but has said he does not feel the hilly circuit will suit him; instead, with the Tour de France stars Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome uncertain of their form, the Great Britain coach Rod Ellingworth has said that the team may experiment by backing Jonathan Tiernan-Locke, the recent Tour of Britain winner, who is unproven in a race of this length.</p>"
