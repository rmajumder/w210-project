  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Older people are being denied vital surgery for cancer, hernia repairs and joint replacements because the NHS imposes \"cutoffs\" for treatment based on age discrimination, a report has warned.</p> <p>Health professionals can be too quick to decide against offering surgery because of \"outdated assumptions of age and fitness\", according to the study by the Royal College of Surgeons, the charity Age UK and communications consultancy MHP Health Mandate. Doctors and surgeons should stop using chronological age to assess suitability for a procedure and instead use their \"biological age\", or overall health, because growing life expectancy and the increasingly good health of senior citizens make birth date alone redundant as the deciding factor, it says.</p> <p>The study found that while people's health needs increase as they grow older, rates of planned surgery for some common conditions among older people steadily decline. \"The gap between the increasing health need and access to surgery means many older people are missing out on potentially lifesaving treatment,\" concludes the study, which details the variation by age group in patterns of treatment for eight types of surgery.</p> <p>\"It is alarming to think the treatment a patient receives may be influenced by their age,\" said Professor Norman Williams, president of the Royal College of Surgeons. While there are often valid explanations why older patients decide not to have surgery or are recommended non-surgical treatment, he said: \"The key is that it is a decision based on the patient rather than how old they are that matters.\"</p> <p>The report details \"barriers\" to older people receiving surgery, including that \"some symptoms can be dismissed as an inevitable part of ageing rather than a potential sign of ill-health. This can mean a disease is at a more advanced stage by the time they are diagnosed, ruling out surgical treatment\". Equally, some older patients' overall health may mean the risks of having a procedure outweigh the benefits.</p> <p>The report takes doctors and surgeons to task for letting outdated attitudes influence their decision-making about older people's eligibility for surgery. \"The clinical benefit of providing treatment may be questioned when relative life expectancy is shorter,\" it says.</p> <p>Communication with older patients to discuss risks and benefits can be limited or ineffective. Conflation of chronological and biological age \"means decisions may not always be made on the basis of a comprehensive and objective assessment but on a series of assumptions about fitness in older age\".</p> <p>While the incidence of breast cancer is highest in women aged 85 and over, surgery peaks among those in their mid-60s and declines sharply from 70. Similarly, rates of surgery for prostate cancer, which kills 10,000 men a year, do not reflect the number of older men being diagnosed with the disease.</p> <p>Life expectancy is 78 for men and 82 for women. Yet men and women who need a new hip or knee, usually owing to arthritis or a fall, are most likely to get one up to the age of 75 but less likely to do so after that, even though National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) guidelines to the NHS say age should not influence whether someone has that surgery, given its benefits.</p> <p>Joint replacements appear to be increasingly restricted as the NHS rations treatments in an attempt to save \u00a320bn by 2015. That financial pressure could mean older people are disproportionately affected by this trend in coming years, the report warns.</p> <p>The gap between the number of people living with a condition or health need and the rates of surgery among older people should make surgeons and other health professionals rethink their attitudes to treatment for senior citizens, said Michelle Mitchell, charity director general at Age UK. \"When it comes to people's health their date of birth actually tells you very little. A healthy 80-year-old could literally run rings round someone many years younger who does not share the same good health.</p> <p>\"Yet in the past too many medical decisions we believe have been made on age alone with informal 'cutoffs' imposed so that people over a certain age were denied treatment.\"</p> <p>Such practices are now illegal. In June, the government said denying drugs or treatments on the grounds of age would be outlawed from this month, meaning older people may be able to sue the NHS to challenge decisions they feel are discriminatory because of their age.</p> <p>\"A new legal framework to outlaw age discrimination in the NHS cements our moral duty of care to older patients and sends a clear signal to the NHS to deliver the best care and support to every patient in line with his or her needs,\" the report notes.</p> <p>The Department of Health said the NHS should not deny patients treatment because of their age. \"There should be absolutely no place in the NHS for assumptions about entitlement to treatment that are based on age or any other form of unjustified discrimination,\" said Dan Poulter, the health minister. \"All patients should be treated as individuals, with dignity and respect, and receive care that meets their healthcare needs irrespective of their age.</p> <p>\"The government is committed to providing dignity in elderly care, and at the beginning of October we introduced an age discrimination ban, which means that all patients will receive a more personalised care service, based on their individual needs, not their age.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's not exactly what you would call sticking it to the Man, but I did save myself a premium rate phone call and a few bob in subscriptions by not watching the Audley Harrison fight at the weekend. Boxing has its own channel now, BoxNation, where for a small fee you can watch pasty-faced Eastenders, or African-Americans you have never heard of, knocking seven bells out of each other any hour of the day or night, and Audley was their big attraction on Saturday night, fighting David Price for the British and Commonwealth heavyweight title.</p> <p>As a consummate professional, I felt I ought to be among those present and set about accessing it, but they needed my Sky viewing card number which would have meant taking the card out of the digital box just as the rest of the family was gathered round the set for Strictly Come Dancing and those other Saturday night family bonding programmes that have replaced the sing-song round the piano we enjoyed when I was a lad \u2013 or would have had we had a piano.</p> <p>Also, with a lot of these subscriptions the onus is on the subscriber to cancel, and I never get round to it. As a result there are direct debits on my bank statement that are a complete mystery to me. I really do not need my monthly copy of Philately and Philatelist, having given up stamp collecting some 50 years ago, and I could probably do without MUTV as well.</p> <p>Still, if you were ever curious about what political and general world views underpinned the stylish midfield play of Scottish international and Manchester United legend Pat Crerand, the channel enlightened us this week. They're running a programme called The Football League Files, in which Jim Rosenthal looks back at the history of the world, much like Andrew Marr, but with more focus on United.</p> <p>This week it was 1970, and Jim took us back to the aborted Apollo 13 space mission, on which Crerand's views were sought: \"I was always interested in the space race because I'm a great believer we're not the only ones,\" said the elegant wing-half whose ball distribution played a big part in United's&#xa0;successes in the early 1960s. \"I think there's people out there somewhere, and one of the reasons they don't make connection with us is because we're always killing each other.\"</p> <p>Paddy added that 1970 was also notable for Ted Heath's election as prime minister, \"which I wasn't happy about\". Who knew? That was a tight election, as I recall, and if Crerand had made his views known at the time, he could maybe have swung it.</p> <p>The mind was free to concentrate on such issues, with no top-flight football at the weekend. I hate those weekends: no Match Of The Day, no Ray Stubbs on ESPN with his little grey goatee beard, nothing much to laugh at at all. It is not even as if England are fun to watch, especially against teams like San Marino, where collectively they remind one of someone struggling to get into a packet marked \"tear here\" but with no proper perforations, eventually resorting to a pair of scissors \u2013 or Andy Carroll, in the case of England.</p> <p>(Mark Lawrenson, also sporting a little grey goatee \u2013 is this some charity thing I have missed? \u2013 said on Football Focus that San Marino \"should be in their own group with the Liechtensteins\", who I remember as a charming couple who ran a small delicatessen round the corner from us.)</p> <p>And so, in the absence of MOTD, to the boxing on Channel 5, who got lucky with their European super-middleweight title fight between James&#xa0;DeGale and Hadillah Mohoumadi.&#xa0;Mohoumadi is the French champion, which I gather is about as significant as being Albania's top crown green bowls player, but 5 promised us he would give DeGale a decent fight and,&#xa0;unusually for boxing, this was not just hype.</p> <p>Not that the night was entirely free of the bombast fight game fans love. Profiled before the contest, DeGale asked: \"What does the future hold for me? This maybe sounds big, but: Greatness.\" Boxers, eh, you can't help liking them.</p> <p>Tyson Fury is another British boxer not greatly troubled by self-doubt, and Channel 5 was fortunate enough to catch him in the crowd for some inter-round chit-chat \u2013 or not, depending on how active m'learned friends are in the area of banter between boxers. Despite reminders he was \"live on Channel 5\", Fury was uninhibited in his assessment of Harrison's conqueror, David Price: \"You see, you plumber from Liverpool, it's personal between me and you, and I'm going to do you some serious harm, you big stiff. They're going to need 10 plumbers to do you up, when I've finished with you.\"</p> <p>Less controversially, he described Harrison as \"the biggest bum inside boxing\". The commentator Dave Farrar added that the Harrison fight had lasted just 82&#xa0;seconds. Result: another lifetime commitment sidestepped.</p>",
