  "<p>Christian Horner on Thursday hailed Red Bull's third successive year of domination in Formula One as \"for sure our biggest achievement.\" And the team principal suggested that Sebastian Vettel could go on to emulate and even beat Michael Schumacher's record of seven titles when he said: \"I can quite easily see him with us for another five years.\"</p> <p>Red Bull are poised to become only the fourth team to win a hat-trick of constructors' championship in Abu Dhabi this weekend. Vettel, meanwhile, is favourite to land another hat-trick \u2013 the drivers' title \u2013 in Texas or Brazil later this month.</p> <p>Horner could be forgiven his moment of pride, because his claims are justified. Formula One, dreading another period of monotonous domination so soon after the Schumacher/Ferrari era, changed the rules this year, especially in relation to the blown diffuser and the flexi-wing, to emasculate the runaway bulls from Milton Keynes.</p> <p>The plan was to drag Red Bull back into the pack. And for the first two thirds of the season, it worked. But the old order has been restored, with Vettel winning the last four grands prix; he has led every lap of the last three races, equalling Ayrton Senna's 1989 record.</p> <p>Referring to the rule changes that were designed to bring an end to his team's hegemony, Horner said: \"Formula One has a history of doing that sort of thing. Look at active suspension, or you can go back 20 years and see it. I think we saw a big regulation change which had a big effect on our performance. We have not moaned or complained about it, we have just worked hard on the same sheet of paper as everyone else.</p> <p>\"It is uncomfortable [for some people] the success that Sebastian has had and uncomfortable for some the success that Red Bull has had. That's not our fault.\"</p> <p>Time and again, Horner talk about the ethos of a successful team. \"It is very simplistic to say it is all about [chief technical officer] Adrian Newey. Yes, it's Adrian's team but you have to have all of the elements doing their bit. I liken it to a conductor \u2013 you can have the greatest conductor in the world but if you haven't got the right string instruments or wind instruments, the music will be rubbish.\"</p> <p>But Horner's efforts were in vain because Newey and Vettel were the only members of the team his audience wanted to talk about. \"Adrian is the greatest designer in Formula One since Colin Chapman. What he has achieved is unprecedented, in the modern world of F1 and we have created an environment that has got the best out of Adrian, one that he enjoys and feels stimulated in.\"</p> <p>Red Bull's domination is looking dangerously like an epoch. And if they do go on to match Ferrari, Horner feels it will be the greater achievement. \"The difference between that time and now is that then you had total freedom. You had competition of tyre manufacturers, you had total freedom of testing, and there was no one else operating at Ferrari at Schumacher's level. Whereas now, the way the regulations are, everybody's got the same tyres and everybody is allowed the same amount of testing.</p> <p>\"It's much more constricted and restricted. So to achieve success now, and dominance, is arguably a lot harder than it was in that period.</p> <p>\"This year, we have worked really, really well and effectively because we quite often haven't had the quickest car. On those days, the drivers \u2013 particularly Sebastian \u2013 have dragged the best out of it.\"</p> <p>Horner reserved his most fulsome praise for the driver who \u2013 aged only 25 \u2013 could equal Sir Jackie Stewart's record of 27 victories in Abu Dhabi on Sunday.</p> <p>\"What Sebastian has achieved in a relatively short period has been hugely impressive. And he will get better. That's the exciting thing about him.</p> <p>\"He's driving better this year compared to last year, and he drove better in 2011 than he did in 2010 because his experience is growing and his character is continuing to evolve. You forget what a young guy he is.\"</p> <p>Formula One is expected to have a fourth British driver next season, with Max Chilton tipped to take over from Charles Pic at Marussia. Chilton, who organises his own sponsorship and has a multimillionaire father, will take Pic's place in the first practice session on Friday. The 21-year-old said: \"I'm a racer and I want to get a race seat. I'd love the chance, and hopefully it will come soon. I'd like to do a good job, but it would be a bit silly for an F1 team to try to work out whether you are ready with just one session.\"</p>",
  "<p>What is it about Mitt Romney and Italians? The Republican presidential candidate seems to be possessed of a sublime capacity for, well, pissing them off.</p> <p>He was at it again on Thursday in Roanoke, Virginia, where he was reported by the Italian news agency Ansa as having asked his audience: \"If you're an entrepreneur and you're thinking of starting up a business, you need to ask yourself: Is America on the same road as Greece? Are we on the path to an economic crisis like that we're seeing in Europe, in Italy and Spain?\"</p> <p>Italians, who thought they'd just put the worse of the eurozone crisis behind them, are not exactly thrilled at being mentioned in the same breath as the Greeks. The Republican candidate's remarks were picked up by news websites here and <a href=\"http://www.corriere.it/esteri/speciali/2012/elezioni-usa/notizie/1nov-romney-con-obama-diventiamo-italia_86c696f4-243d-11e2-9217-937e87f32cd3.shtml9\">given front-page prominence</a>. La Repubblica ran <a href=\"http://rampini.blogautore.repubblica.it/2012/11/01/il-candidato-repubblicano-si-ricorda-di-noi/?ref=HREA-1\">an aggrieved comment</a> from one of its correspondents in the US:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The American right needs enemies. Italy, along with Spain and Greece, is the ideal bogeyman \u2026 the negative paradigm, the model of all that should not be done in terms of statism and nanny-statery.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>If reaction in Italy seems a bit OTT, you have to bear in mind that only four days ago <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ8P04q6jqE\">their flagship auto manufacturer was targeted (along with President Obama, of course) in a Romney ad</a> that claimed \"President Obama\u2026 sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build jeeps in China\" \u2013 a claim <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-11-01/romney-ad-seen-as-distortion-prompts-protest-by-u-dot-s-dot-automakers\">swiftly denied by Fiat's CEO, Sergio Marchionne</a>.</p> <p>If that were not enough, there is the involvement of Bain Capital in a privatisation deal that would bring cheer to the face of a Russian oligarch. The firm (of which Romney was chief executive) <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-06/romney-persona-non-grata-in-italy-for-bain-s-deal-skirting-taxes.html\">bought a telephone-directory company from the Italian government</a> that it sold two years later for about 25 times what it paid \u2013 a coup that left Italian taxpayers feeling they might just have lost out.</p>",
  "<p>Kenny Dalglish has said he was not dismissed as Liverpool manager due to his defence of Luis Su\u00e1rez and believes more senior Anfield figures should have taken responsibility for the club's handling of the striker's racism charge.</p> <p>Dalglish was at the forefront of Liverpool's belligerent support for Su\u00e1rez after he was found guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra and handed an eight-match ban last season. He was often the only person to defend Liverpool's position with the club's owners, Fenway Sports Group, silent throughout and the managing director Ian Ayre extending an apology only after Su\u00e1rez refused to shake Evra's hand at Old Trafford.</p> <p>Asked whether the Su\u00e1rez saga had cost him his job, Dalglish, who led Liverpool to the Carling Cup trophy and the FA Cup final, but only eighth in the Premier League last season after major investment in players, said: \"I don't think so. That was up to them [the owners]. I can go to sleep at night knowing what I did I did to the best of my ability and if that does not come up to their expectations or they want to go in another direction \u2013 they own the club.</p> <p>\"The owners made the decision they thought was best. They don't want to make a decision which is detrimental to the club because if they did that they would hang themselves, they have a huge investment in it. I think anything that is not done in a positive manner cannot help you but I was only the manager. There are other people with greater intelligence than me and greater responsibilities than me when it comes to something like this.</p> <p>\"I think [it was] the club as a whole. It wasn't just me [making decisions]. The T-shirts [worn in support of Su\u00e1rez at Wigan] were the players wanting to show their support for a team-mate. It might have been misguided and not have been right but it was not me who decided it.\"</p> <p>Dalglish was highly critical of the process that led to Su\u00e1rez being found guilty by an independent panel appointed by the Football Association. In an interview with TalkSport, he claimed he would not be as co-operative with the authorities should he find himself in a similar predicament in future. He added: \"A lot of things were misguided, misinterpreted and misrepresented. I was always brought up to tell the truth and what I believed to be the truth, I said. If it ever came up again I would do it differently. I would be less helpful and less forthcoming and I think that is sad.\"</p> <p>Liverpool want Tottenham's Alex Inglethorpe to take charge of their reserve team. The move would see the current manager, Rodolfo Borrell, taking a technical role at the club.</p>",
  "<p>Ministers are facing criticism after the removal of the only black and Muslim members of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission from their posts, heightening fears that the coalition will place less emphasis on fighting discrimination.</p> <p>Leading commissioners Simon Woolley and Lady Meral Hussein-Ece have discovered that their contracts as commissioners will not be renewed when they expire in December. Though both were invited to reapply for further terms by Lynne Featherstone, the equalities minister, before the reshuffle, neither has been shortlisted or called for interview.</p> <p>There has been no explanation, but both Woolley and Hussein-Ece have raised concerns within the commission and outside about the effect of swingeing budget cuts being imposed on the statutory body and the effect of downsizing on the minorities who work there. Woolley and Hussein-Ece, vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on race and community, were appointed commissioners three years ago on two-day-a-week contracts.</p> <p>Woolley has championed issues such as police stop-and-search and disability. He is also director and one of the founders of the organisation Operation Black Vote.</p> <p>Woolley would say only that he was disappointed, while Hussein-Ece declined to comment. But MPs joined critics in denouncing the treatment of the commissioners and calling for the decision to be reversed. \"There is a credibility gap opening up between the commission and black and minority ethnic communities,\" said David Lammy, MP for Tottenham and chair of the parliamentary group on race and community. \"Simon and Hussein-Ece represent senior mainstream campaigners who have had cross-party respect. It is unfathomable that they were not called for interview and confirms deep fears \u2026 that the commission is turning its back on race issues.\"</p> <p>Diane Abbott, the shadow public health spokeswoman, said: \"It's very worrying. Simon has a wonderful record working with all political parties and had a great reference. The fact that they wouldn't even interview him was a calculated insult. It seems to me that race is slipping off the agenda at the commission.\"</p> <p>Lester Holloway, an executive member of the grouping Ethnic Minority Liberal Democrats \u2013 once chaired by Hussein-Ece \u2013 said they would be pursuing the matter. \"A commission without Meral and Simon is like a train without a track. Looks like another nail in the EHRC's coffin from the undertakers in the coalition.\"</p> <p>The move is also being opposed by the unions. \"It is interesting that Simon Woolley has opposed the frontloading of cuts that would see many disabled and minority staff losing their jobs,\" said Sue Bond, vice-chair of the Public and Commercial Services Union and trades union chair at the commission.</p> <p>\"We have no assurance that a new board will itself have the diversity it needs to champion equality. We urge the government to think again.\"</p> <p>The commission has appointed Lady O'Neill as part-time chairman to replace Trevor Phillips, whose term ended last month.</p> <p>The revelations intensify widening concern about the impact of coalition cuts at the commission. Last month, officials from the United Nations warned that the body could lose its \"A-list\" status, which would mean the UK could no longer fully participate in the UN human rights council or work within the international co-ordinating committee. Almost all western European nations carry A-list status.</p> <p>The government has earmarked a budget of \u00a326.8m for the commission in 2014-15, a 62% cut to its 2007 budget of \u00a370m. Some fear that as spending cuts deepen and reflecting Tory scepticism about much of the commission's remit, the budget could be driven as low as \u00a318m.</p> <p>A government source said: \"The EHRC is undergoing a period of reform now being lead by Lady O'Neill. A new board will be appointed shortly and those on the shortlist reflect a variety of diversity and expertise.</p> <p>\"Those currently on the board due not to have an extended term will remain until the recruitment process is complete. The government is hugely commited to the EHRC's future and its unfortunate that people would seek to make a political argument on an issue the coalition government is on agreement over.\"</p>",

  "<p>I believe, now that <a href=\"http://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Black History Month</a> is drawing to a close, we need to look at the future of BHM in this country and ask some serious questions. New research reveals that spending on Black History Month by London's boroughs has dropped by almost half. This is striking because almost half of Britain's ethnic minorities are in the London area and local authorities might have been expected to take it seriously. The worst examples of these cuts come from Camden, Greenwich and Westminster councils, who have completely scrapped their BHM budget. Others, such as Islington, Lewisham and Wandsworth, have decreased their budgets by almost 70% since 2009.</p> <p>Some might say that, in a time of austerity, spending on this special month is a \"politically correct\" luxury that hard-pressed local authorities can ill afford. But many are arguing that the collapse of interest in BHM reflects a more serious issue. Local authorities feel free to slash spending on it because racial diversity is taking a back seat when it comes to public policy.</p> <p>To understand the political significance of BHM, it is necessary to understand its history. The first BHM event was organised by the Greater London Council in 1987 (which was also the year when history was made, with black MPs including me being elected to parliament). But BHM wasn't just an isolated celebration. It was part of a successful move to fight racism and push racial equality up the political agenda. Lord Herman Ouseley, Lady Valerie Amos and Lord Boateng all made their names as young black radicals in the local authority politics of the period. They argued for and implemented a whole range of policies on racial equality, most crucially around employment, housing and the voluntary sector.</p> <p>Without that political campaigning, London might have fallen victim to the entrenched political inequality and separatism that characterises so many northern towns. The BNP found it much harder to get a foothold in London than in the industrial north. This is the legacy of the anti-racist campaigning of the 1980s in which BHM played an important, symbolic role.</p> <p>When Boris Johnson became mayor of London, one of the first things he did was to slash spending on BHM by 92%, completely eliminate funding for Africa Day and remove the funding for London's anti-racism festival, Rise. The symbolism was unmistakable and was not lost on London's black population.</p> <p>What is harder to document is the picture that is gradually becoming clear of millions of pounds of public sector cuts which are falling most heavily on ethnic minority staff and the ethnic minority-led voluntary sector. There is the old American saying \"Last to be hired; first to be fired\" And BME workers, particularly at a management level, are a relatively recent phenomenon in the white-collar public sector world particularly at a management level. BME workers, particularly black women, are heavily over-represented in the public sector. One of the reasons for this is because local authorities \u2013 precisely because of the political campaigns of the 80s \u2013 have been more willing to adopt fair and transparent employment policies.</p> <p>Some of the left react badly when the argument is made that the cuts are falling most heavily on the black community. They claim it is wrong to \"racialise\" the effects of austerity. But a wilful refusal to even consider that the cuts may hit BME communities hardest is dangerous. When those communities explode it is too easy to see it merely as a law and order problem rather than to look at the underlying economic issues.</p>"
