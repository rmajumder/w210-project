  "<p>Rochelle Dalton is doing her daily rounds of the chapel of rest, checking up on her \"clients\". \"Every morning I come down here just to make sure there are plenty of tissues, to make sure the flowers are OK, and to make sure that all the deceased are all right,\" she says. Well, as all right as you can be when you're deceased I supposed. \"Sometimes the bodies can look maybe a little blue ... and so then we have to put a bit of makeup on just to cover that,\" she explains. Same with quite a lot of the living, too, I find.</p> <p>Rochelle works at Lilleywhite Funeral Services, a traditional family-run undertakers in Manchester and one of the subjects of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01ms3h2\" title=\"\"><strong>Dead Good Job</strong></a> (BBC2). The boss, Simon Lilleywhite, all in black, is just as you would expect \u2013 and want \u2013 him to be. Pale, polished, polite, bordering on obsequious. More than bordering on Dickensian. With a nice line in euphemisms. The deceased may need to be embalmed \"to make sure nature doesn't take its course sooner rather than later\", he says. Rot, I believe he means.</p> <p>There's little danger of that happening at Haji Taslim Funerals in east London, an altogether livelier place. It needs to be; for Muslims it's all about speed and getting the soul to paradise in the shortest possible time. The details of how it gets there are less important. \"They do it over the phone,\" says Gulam Taslim, who runs the company with his no-nonsense daughter Moona. \"Here they don't say I want class A or class B, I want a coffin with special handles. They just say give me a funeral, just like they're ordering a pizza, it's as simple as that.\"</p> <p>Got it. Hang on though, because when I order I pizza, I don't just call up and say: \"Give me a pizza.\" I say I want the 12in rustica with extra cheese, and anchovies, with special handles, delivered in a carriage pulled by white horses, or failing that by a man with a big box on the back of his moped. You may need to work on your metaphors Gulam. I do like the way Muslims do it \u2013 quickly and with the minimum of fuss.</p> <p>Paul Sinclair, a biking vicar (the \"faster pastor\"), also specialises in speed, though with quite a lot of fuss. He has a fleet of sidecar hearses and powerful motorcycles to carry his clients \u2013 mainly bikers \u2013 on their way. And he likes to give them a \"last blast\", a final twist of the right hand, that thrilling surge forward, blistering acceleration towards wherever it is bikers go next. There's something lovely about that.</p> <p>There'll be no \"last blast\" for Malcolm Frost though. Because along with dozens of his biking pals, there are a couple of police motorcyclists at his funeral as well, presumably there to lay to rest any plans for a last blast. Boo.</p> <p>There's a good mix here, then, of the different ways people say goodbye. The film is a lovely one (three actually, with two more parts to come) \u2013 sensitive, but surprisingly upbeat, jolly even. Celebratory, just as the best funerals are.</p> <p>The one really sad case is terminally ill Denise, who is having to organise her own cremation. No one should have to do that should they, unless they want to? Which Denise clearly doesn't. \"I'm terrified,\" she says. \"I'm absolutely frightened to death.\"</p> <p>The new season of <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/grand-designs/\" title=\"\"><strong>Grand Designs</strong></a> (Channel 4) started rather frustratingly. We're in a lovely place, Lough Key in County Roscommon, Ireland, which is overlooked by a lovely 19th-century folly. With a lovely name: Cloontykilla Castle. It now belongs to a flamboyant actor called Sean Simons (no, me neither, and a cursory search doesn't bring up much, but he appears to have lots of money \u2013 to start with anyhow).</p> <p>Sean sets about realising his dream, which seems to be to turn Cloontykilla into a sort of inhabitable faux-medieval fantasy, a little bit Disney, a little bit porn set, though no one (including the planning officers) really knows, because Sean's plans aren't on paper, they're in his head.</p> <p>We need to talk about design, yells Kevin McCloud, but Sean puts his hands over his ears, shouts la la la la, builds a wall, knocks it down again, builds it somewhere else. Then on the breeze, from beyond the castle walls, comes the stench of the rotting corpse of the celtic tiger. Work grinds to a halt.</p> <p>To be fair, Sean is good value, but I like Grand Designs more when it's that \u2013 grand designs \u2013 and you end up with something truly interesting and original. Sean's castle remains unfinished, and unsatisfactory. Better before, I think, when it was just a folly and not Sean's folly.</p>",
  "<p>Government plans to cut the public sector payroll appear to be faltering, as official figures revealed a sharp slowdown in job cuts across Whitehall and local government over the summer.</p> <p>The number of civil servants declined by 5,000 in the three months to the end of July, and the overall drop in public sector employment was restricted to 39,000, as cuts that have reduced the civil service headcount by more than 600,000 since the financial crash ran out of steam.</p> <p>Ministers heralded a 235,000 decline in the public sector payroll during the quarter, to 5.9 million, but the Office for National Statistics said the cut followed a decision to reclassify 196,000 further education and sixth-form teachers as private sector employees.</p> <p>The number of health workers was higher than three years ago, at 1.55 million, and the number of teachers remained at 1.6 million, including FE and sixth-form staff. Analysts said it was becoming more difficult for ministers to find easy ways to reduce staff numbers as the coalition's austerity plans entered a third year.</p> <p>David Cameron said he was disturbed by a rise in youth unemployment and a 16-year high in the number of people out of work for more than a year.</p> <p>ONS figures showed the jobless total fell by 7,000 in the quarter to July to 2.59 million, an unemployment rate of 8.1%. The number claiming jobseeker's allowance last month was 1.57 million, down by 15,000 on July \u2013 the largest monthly fall since June 2010.</p> <p>More than 100,000 people gained full-time employment and 136,000 part-time jobs were created during the three months to July, while the number of vacancies remained static.</p> <p>One economist said creating 236,000 jobs in a single quarter was \"a remarkable achievement at any time but in current economic conditions is near miraculous\".</p> <p>John Philpott, director of the Jobs Economist, said: \"Even more remarkable is the fact that the economy is adding so many jobs against a backdrop of a near static level of job vacancies. Indeed, the number of unemployed people per vacancy is slightly higher than in mid-2010. In other words, the labour market is proving really effective at filling whatever vacancies do arise even though, as a result of weak macroeconomic conditions, the economy isn't creating net extra vacancies.\"</p> <p>The Olympics is believed to have played a part in boosting the figures, after a recruitment drive during June and July in London, where the ONS found the largest rises in employment. The capital accounted for 5,500 of the fall in the so-called claimant count.</p> <p>The number of part-time workers increased by 134,000 to 8.12 million, the highest since records began in 1992. The number of Britons working part-time because they could not find a full-time job also hit a record high, of 1.42 million. The number of people out of work for more than a year was the highest for more than 16 years, at 904,000, up 22,000 on the previous quarter.</p> <p>The prime minister said there were some \"very encouraging\" figures in the data, but pressed by Ed Miliband during PMQs he acknowledged: \"The long-term unemployment figure is disturbing.</p> <p>\"That is what the work programme is designed to deal with. The work programme we have got up and running within a year has helped already 690,000 people and the key part of it is that those who are hardest to help \u2013 people on the incapacities-style benefit \u2013 and also who have been long-term unemployed we pay the training providers more to help them into work and that is the key for dealing with this problem in the time ahead.\"</p> <p>Miliband said the clearest evidence that the work programme was not working was the fact that over the past 12 months the number of young people unemployed for more than a year was up 247%. Cameron said it was \"disappointing\" that the latest figures showed youth unemployment was up by 7,000 in the last quarter, but stressed the figure included those in full-time education.</p> <p>John Walker, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the continued fall in unemployment was good news, but for the economy to recover at a faster pace more people need to find full-time work. \"Policies targeted at stimulating job creation, such as extending the national insurance contributions holiday, are needed to give small firms the confidence to create full-time positions and take on staff,\" he said.</p> <p>Unison's general secretary, Dave Prentis, said the government needed a long-term plan of job creation to ease the UK's economic woes. \"For families suffering the misery of unemployment, any decrease will be welcome news, but it is clear when you look at the bigger economic picture that any talk of growth is premature. In areas such as Yorkshire and Humberside, and the West Midlands \u2013 where unemployment is already among the highest in the UK \u2013 unemployment continues to go up, meaning yet more misery for families struggling to get by.\"</p>",
  "<p>News Corporation lobbyist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Michel's barrage of emails, texts and phone calls over Rupert Murdoch's bid for BSkyB almost brought down former culture secretary Jeremy Hunt and saw the resignation of his special adviser Adam Smith. And the gossips at the Leveson inquiry wondered who would be first to find a new job \u2013 Hunt or Michel. In the end it was neck and neck. Hunt was promoted to health secretary last week and this week it emerged that Michel has also popped up in a <a href=\"http://saladeprensa.telefonica.com/jsp/base.jsp?contenido=/jsp/notasdeprensa/notadetalle.jsp&amp;selectNumReg=5&amp;pagina=1&amp;id=66&amp;origen=notapres&amp;idm=eng&amp;pais=1&amp;elem=18735\" title=\"\">new job as the \"Europe director, public affairs and communication\" for Telefonica</a>, the parent company of O2.

  "<h2>David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce</h2> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/12/uk-unemployment-fall-olympics-jobs\" title=\"\">latest job market figures</a> are once again encouraging, and support our belief that the UK economy has returned to positive growth in the third quarter. Employment is up, unemployment and the claimant count are down, and the rate of inactivity is at its lowest since 1991. These figures will no doubt raise more questions about the accuracy of the latest GDP figures, which show three consecutive quarters of negative growth.</p> <p>Despite this positive news, there are still some areas of concern. The number of people forced to work part-time because they cannot find a full-time job has reached a new high, and there are still too many young people unemployed. More deficit cuts in the coming months mean there will be a further reduction in public sector employment, although it is reassuring to see that the private sector is willing and able to create new jobs.</p> <p>Overall, it is clear that growth is still too weak, and problems in the eurozone will continue to put pressure on our exporters. The government must build on the positive job figures by implementing more policies that allow businesses to deliver growth. An effective growth strategy should include further deregulation, increased infrastructure spending and the creation of a British Business Bank.</p> <h2>Jens Larsen, chief European economist, RBC Capital Markets</h2> <p>Unemployment is steady, the employment rate is picking up and the inactivity rate is falling. Given the weak output performance, the result is continued weak productivity performance. Our best explanation is that the underlying drivers of weak demand and weak productivity are the same: if the financial sector is constraining consumption and investment demand, and also holds back the necessary re-allocation of resources, then both demand and productivity will suffer. Of course, it might be possible that GDP will be revised up, or even surprise on the upside. Wage growth continues to be restrained\u2014whether that reflects spare capacity in the labour market or weak productivity growth remains the key question.</p> <h2>John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist</h2> <p>Today's figures confirm that the UK continues to enjoy a jobs boom even though the economy is struggling to emerge from the double dip recession. An additional 236,000 jobs in a single quarter, more than 100,000 full-time, is a remarkable achievement at any time but in current economic conditions is near miraculous.</p> <p>Even more remarkable is the fact that the economy is adding so many jobs against a backdrop of a near static level of job vacancies. Indeed, the number of unemployed people per vacancy is slightly higher than in mid-2010. In other words, the labour market is proving really effective at filling whatever vacancies do arise even though, as a result of weak macroeconomic conditions, the economy isn't creating net extra vacancies. This probably in part reflects pressure on welfare claimants to seek work more actively and partly to the fact that jobseekers in general are more prepared than in previous decades to take whatever work is on offer, no matter what pay or hours are involved. Either way this amounts to a structural shift in the operation of the labour market. Consequently, the labour market is at least to some extent decoupled from the macro economy, albeit prolonged weak output growth may eventually have a negative impact on jobs and unemployment if it results in far fewer net vacancies to fill or increased redundancies.</p> <h2>Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit</h2> <p>The UK economy appears to be in rude health, creating a near-record increase in jobs over the summer, led by the private sector taking on staff in increasing numbers. The data are in line with the message from the business surveys that the economy is by no means in another downturn, as indicated by official economic growth data, but enjoyed a strong expansion so far this year. However, recent downturns in the surveys suggest that the startling job creation seen so far this year is set to wane unless demand picks up further. In that respect, we see some encouragement from recent developments to alleviate the eurozone crisis, which may well bring about a swift upturn in business confidence and remove one of the biggest causes of weak global economic growth in recent months.</p> <p>Data from the Office for National Statistics showed employment rising by an impressive 236,000 in the three months to July, the third-largest increase ever seen and taking employment up to 29.56 million, its highest since May 2008. Since comparable data were first available in 1971, the latest increase has only been exceeded by the 276,000 rise seen in the three months to July 2010 and the 239,000 increase seen in the three months to August 1987.</p> <p>It was not all good news though, with the unemployment rate \u2013 as measured by the labour force survey \u2013 rising to 8.1%. Unemployment now stands at 2.59 million, but perhaps more worryingly the number of people that have been unemployed for more than one year rose to 904,000, its highest since May 2006.</p> <h2>Ian Brinkley, director of The Work Foundation</h2> <p>The overall figures are remarkably good. This is the third quarter that total employment has increased despite the economy apparently being in recession \u2013 still not enough to confirm a trend, but definitely not a blip. The private sector has continued to hire in large numbers, although the overall performance may also have been boosted by a temporary slowdown in public sector job losses in the three months to June.</p> <p>What is striking is how little impact this has had on unemployment \u2013 despite the large numbers of jobs created, unemployment has fallen by just 7,000. Large numbers of students, retirees and people on long-term sick leave seem to be returning to the jobs market, putting extra pressure on it. The rapid growth of the working age population is also having an effect. This development shows just how much of the pain in the labour market has been hidden in the past. There is still a long way to go before unemployment returns to normal levels. Digging beneath the totals, the figures show some weaknesses. The majority of the new jobs were either part-time or self-employed. While any increase in employment is encouraging, a full labour market recovery must offer more full-time employee jobs. The number of people in part-time jobs who said they wanted a full-time job did not increase significantly, but is still at a record high.</p> <h2>David Tinsley, economist at BNP Paribas</h2> <p>There's no doubt the UK labour market is providing a good deal of solace to those fed up with hearing about the recession. The big puzzle in the data remains however how an economy that still has a level of GDP that is 4.5% below the level seen in 2008 Q1, just before the UK entered recession, can have a level of employment that is now 0.2% higher over that period. This implies a puzzlingly large loss of labour productivity in the economy. Many of the candidate explanations, such as significant labour hoarding, the impact of sectoral rebalancing or the possibility that GDP or employment is being mismeasured, appear to provide only partial explanations.</p> <p>For policy of course this is fiendishly difficult. The MPC can't realistically be confident about where domestically generated inflationary pressures will be in year or two's time if the level of employment could quite plausibly be lower or higher than today. Only time will tell and with the benefit of hindsight no doubt the committee will be judged as having got it 'wrong' one way or another. But one has to have some sympathy with policymakers having to play the rather confusing hand they are being dealt currently.</p>",

  "<p>The public feuding between Israel and Washington ratcheted up sharply on Tuesday amid claims that Barack Obama has declined to meet Binyamin Netanyahu during the Israeli prime minister's visit to the US later this month.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/white-house-declines-netanyahu-request-to-meet-with-obama.premium-1.464328\">Haaretz reported</a> an Israeli official as saying that Netanyahu asked for a meeting with the president after attending the opening of the UN general assembly in New York in late September. Netanyahu offered to travel to Washington but the White House allegedly said Obama was too busy. Israeli officials confirmed that version of events to other reporters. </p> <p>But the White House denied any intentional snub of Netanyahu, saying that the president was not able to meet the Israeli leader in New York because the pair would not be in the city on the same day. It also said Netanyahu did not request a meeting in Washington, \"nor was a request for a meeting ever denied\". However, Israeli officials continued to assert in private that Obama appeared to have snubbed the Israeli leader. </p> <p>It will be the first time Netanyahu travels to the US as prime minister without seeing Obama. </p> <p>The perception of deepening strains was reinforced by an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/11/binyamin-netanyahu-us-iran-nuclear\">undiplomatic warning to the US from Netanyahu</a> on Tuesday over Iran's nuclear programme which prompted suspicions in the Obama administration that the Israeli leader is dabbling in the American election campaign. It also resulted in an hour long call from the president to Jerusalem although the White House released little information about what was said. </p> <p>Netanyahu said other countries have no moral right to block an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities if they are not prepared to set firm \"red lines\" for Tehran, including a deadline for it to meet western demands for a halt to uranium enrichment. He did not name the US, but that is where the warning was aimed.</p> <p>\"The world tells Israel: Wait. There's still time. And I say: Wait for what? Wait until when?\" said the Israeli prime minister. \"Those in the international community who refuse to put red lines before Iran don't have a moral right to place a red light before Israel.\"</p> <p>He disparaged economic sanctions against Iran as ineffective, saying that Iran is getting closer every day to building a nuclear weapon.</p> <p>Netanyahu's comments came in response to a statement by Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, who at the weekend rejected Netanyahu's calls for red lines, and said sanctions and diplomacy need to be given time to shift Iran.</p> <p>\"We're not setting deadlines,\" Clinton told Bloomberg Radio. \"We're convinced that we have more time to focus on these sanctions, to do everything we can to bring Iran to a good-faith negotiation.\"</p> <p>The Israeli leader's public challenge to Obama over Iran was taken badly in Washington. The White House said of the president's call to the Israeli leader only that the two \"are united in their determination to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and agreed to continue their close consultations going forward\". But there is a suspicion that Netanyahu is seeking to use the US election to bounce Obama into committing to early military action against Iran or is trying to influence Jewish American votes in favour of the more hawkish Republican candidate, Mitt Romney by suggesting the president is jeopardising Israel's security. </p> <p>Netanyahu only recently pulled back from months of threatening rhetoric over an attack on Iran, under pressure from the US and Europe \u2013 including, it emerged on Tuesday, a highly unusual visit two weeks ago of the head of the British intelligence service MI6, Sir John Sawers, as a special envoy from the prime minister, David Cameron.</p> <p>In meetings with Netanyahu and his defence minister, Ehud Barak, Sawers reinforced the message from Washington that an attack on Iran in the near future would only complicate attempts to dissuade the country from developing a nuclear weapon.</p> <p>An Israeli official source told Haaretz that British fear of an imminent Israeli strike was heightened by Netanyahu's failure in a phone call with Cameron \"to provide clear and precise answers\" to questions about Israeli intentions.</p> <p>As it toned down the rhetoric, the Israeli leadership sought guarantees of US action if Iran failed to meet western demands - the so-called \"red lines\". But Washington has refused to agree.</p> <p>The US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, further angered the Israelis by saying there is still more than a year to prevent Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon. He also contradicted Israeli claims that Iran had already decided to build an atomic bomb.</p> <p>Israel's defence minister, Ehud Barak, sought to cool tensions on Tuesday, at least in public, by saying that differences should be sorted out \"behind closed doors\".</p> <p>\"We must not forget that the US is Israel's most important source of support in terms of security,\" he said.</p> <p>Last week, the chairman of the House of Representatives intelligence committee, Mike Rogers, described attending a \"very tense\" and argumentative meeting between Netanyahu and the US ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro, in late August at which the pair had \"elevated\" exchanges.<br>Rogers described Netanyahu as at his \"wit's end\" over Obama's refusal to set red lines for Iran.</p> <p>\"It was very, very clear that the Israelis had lost their patience with the administration,\" Rogers told a Detroit radio station. \"We've had sharp exchanges with other heads of state and other things, in intelligence services and other things, but nothing at that level that I've seen in all my time where people were clearly that agitated, clearly that worked up about a particular issue, where there was a very sharp exchange.\"</p> <p>Rogers said Israel will probably bomb Iran if the White House does not lay down firm limits for Iran.</p> <p>Shapiro rejected the characterisation of the meeting.</p> <p>A former senior Israeli foreign ministry official and diplomat who served in the US, Alon Liel, said Netanyahu engineered the confrontation in front of Rogers.</p> <p>\"It appears to be an attempt to help the Republicans in the upcoming election. The entire show, under the patronage of Rogers, is meant to prove to the American public, and in particular to the Jewish community, that the rift between Israel and the United States is more significant and deeper than we thought,\" <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/diplomatic-dressing-down-part-ii.premium-1.463773\">he wrote in Haaretz</a>.</p>",

The whole thing is anchored by Gesundheit's lilting, otherworldly vocal that seems to breeze in and out of the song like a late summer breeze.
