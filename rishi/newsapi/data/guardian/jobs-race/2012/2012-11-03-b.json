  "<p>Wales's wild-haired propmeister Adam Jones has withdrawn, injured, from next Saturday's start of rugby's autumn internationals. So, possibly, will stalwart back-row and fellow Osprey Ryan Jones. But a Jones will still be in the team. One invariably is.</p> <p>It is all of eight Novembers since Ryan won his first cap and became Wales's 73rd rugby Jones when he joined Adam, Dayfdd, Duncan, Stephen and Steve to break an apparent Guinness record for surname surfeit which had stood for 65 years since 1939 when a red-shirted Davies quintet helped make up the XV who took on Ireland in Belfast. (On closer examination this week, that record seems slightly dubious for while Howard, Leslie, Micky and Willie were of the genuine six-letter brotherhood, the Cardiff prop that day WE (\"Wendy\") Davis was missing the third crucial vowel.</p> <p>Six Novembers ago, on the same day Wales were playing at home, at the nearby Millennium Centre the famous stout-founded record book contrived a gathering \"of the world's biggest congregation of people with the same surname\" when 1,000 Joneses turned up, easily to pass the existing record of 583 set by the Norbergs of Sweden. That same afternoon, the 76th Jones was playing for Wales \u2013 as well as the 60th Davies, the 51st Williams, the 47th Evans and the 42nd Thomas. This represented an astonishing spurt from the Jones boys, for only at the turn of the millennium in 2000 the various clans sharing the 975 Welsh caps awarded since 1881 had been just cruising along in a bunch with Jones boasting 60 caps, Davies 56, Williams and Evans each 47, Thomas 36, Morgan 22, Rees 20 and Lewis 19.</p> <p>Also left behind by this Jones rugby sprint were Wales's footballing Joneses. There was no Jones in Wales's recent World Cup football qualifiers and only a solitary Williams. To the turn of the century, the football Joneses had gamely kept in contact \u2013 and it was touching half a dozen years ago I thought, when, on being dropped, goalkeeper Paul Jones said his proudest moment was \"being the 50th Jones to be capped by my country\". At the time, the Jones football tally was 54, followed by 40 Davieses, 27 Williamses and 19 Evanses.</p> <p>Only a paltry seven Joneses have played football for England. But can the Smiths of England offer Wales's rugby Joneses a challenge? Not remotely. Twenty-one Smiths have played football for England and only 10 at rugby \u2013 and that's counting the one-and-only Starmer-Hyphen. There have been only 15 English Test cricketing Smiths. Eleven worldwide Joneses have played Test cricket \u2013 only four for England.</p> <p>Always good fun in surnames \u2026 More than half a century ago the national secretary of the Journalists' Union when I was a cub i/c inkwells, first at the <em>Stroud News</em> and then the <em>Hereford Times</em>, was Eric Blott. The BBC <em>Midlands Today</em> TV show often employs weather forecaster Sara Blizzard. I always smile and think of Evelyn Waugh's botanist hero in <em>Scoop</em> when Radio 4's <em>Saving Species</em> has a nature item by earnest enthusiast Kelvin Boot. Nice, too, that Britain's Lord Chief Justice is Judge Judge; and that one of our finest ever bowls champions is Willie Wood. A Jock McTavish really was capped for Scotland at football (in 1910) and, if you're interested, at soccer England have fielded a Bishop (1926), an Abbott (1902) and a Priest (1900). Whether Scotland's two Speedies were pacy I don't know, but for scholars of eponymy the surname strut of England's rugby team at Twickenham nearly 30 years ago remains descriptively spot on: Hare, Dodge, Swift and Smart, with Wheeler aptly leader of the pack and, on the bench, the thinking man's hooker Brain alongside that deceptive dasher Trick. Alas, that lilywhites XV were soundly beaten 22-12 by Scotland.</p> <p>Cleverly might be an apt name for today's canny Welsh boxing prospect, but not half as adjectivally potent as Newport's British welterweight champ of 1915-21, the obviously ferocious Johnny Basham. For England at rugby Neil Back (1994-2003) was a forward \u2013 and so was Wales's Pontypool policeman Allen Forward (1951-52). Fine Devonian cricketer Peter Bowler was a prolific batsman, but no bowler, for Derbyshire and Somerset, while at the turn of the 20th century England picked for six Tests Kent's bounding paceman Arthur Fielder, but he had to wait till his penultimate match in 1908 at Melbourne for the scorer to log: S Gregory c A Fielder b J Crawford. Arthur was, apparently, none too good a fieldsman and it was the only catch of his Test career.</p> <p>A North plays rugby for Wales, a West has played rugby for England, an East should possibly have played cricket for England, and a Northeast who plays cricket for Kent still may. But no South seems to have played international sport for anyone. For an anonymous news agency subeditor's pithy brevity and soft humour, however, I recommend the cutting I've hoarded for over three decades: \"Top US golfer Andy North's sister, Pamela, yesterday married Mr Dick South\" \u2013 UPI 1977.</p> <p><em>PS \u2013 HOLD THE BACK PAGE \u2026 re the above, I've forgotten to count Wales's Marsden-Jones (1921-24), Jones\u2011Davies (1930-31), Rees-Jones (1934-36), Williams-Jones (1989-95), and Jones\u2011Hughes (1999).</em></p>",

Both measures were eventually blocked by federal courts.&#xa0;</p> <p>Mitchell was also the man behind the removal of convicted felons from the Florida voters' role in 2000 which led to many innocent people with similar names being deprived of the right to vote. A disproportionate number of them were African Americans, who tend to vote for Democrats.&#xa0;The League of Women Voters said that Mitchell's involvement in the most recent legislation is evidence of a \"partisan agenda to manipulate the voting rules\".</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T16:20:47.323Z\">at 4.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50953cf595cb1506d24447b4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T15:49:10.127Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Former President Bill Clinton</strong> has just taken the stage at the Obama rally in Chesapeake, Virginia.</p> <p>Clinton will appear with Obama tonight at a major rally in Bristow, Virginia.</p> <p>The crowd likes them some Clinton.

The NBC/WSJ/Marist poll from yesterday midnight puts Obama ahead 49-47.

Other polls have the race tighter but with Romney generally holding a two percentage point lead.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Tampa Bay Times / Miami Herald poll confirms anecdotal evidence from voting lines - that a good number of undecideds have been persuaded that Romney will do a better job of fixing the economy even if they are not happy with the Republicans on other issues, such as unemployment. Many voters say that the principal issue for them is jobs in a state hit particularly hard by unemployment and the property crash.</p> <p>Both parties are claiming that early voting trends in Florida give them the upper hand. The Republicans say that Democratic turnout is down on four years ago. Democrats say that they are still ahead in absolute terms.&#xa0;About 3.5 million Floridians have voted early so far - either by post or in person. That's about 30% of the state's electorate and a dramatic increase on 2008 when 2.7 million voted early.</p> <p>About 1.39 million of those are registered Republicans and 1.47 are Democrats.

He added: \"I would like that the money I give from the marathon goes to victims.\"</p> <p>It was a common sentiment among disappointed runners.</p> <p>Until late afternoon Friday, participants had been reassured by Bloomberg that despite the devastation upon lower Manhattan and Staten Island \u2013 the race's start point \u2013 the marathon would go ahead.</p> <p>Bloomberg even likened the situation to the running of the 2001 marathon in the shadow of the then still recent terrorist attacks in the city.</p> <p>\"We have to find some way to express ourselves and show solidarity with each other,\" he said, adding: \"We have to have a city going forward\".</p> <p>City officials also cited the revenue brought in by the annual event. More than 1 million spectators turn out annually to line the 26-mile route, piling money into local shops, bars and restaurants.</p> <p>But hours after confirming the race would go ahead, Bloomberg changed his position Friday under intense pressure from those who believed it would be insensitive to stage the marathon.</p> <p>Disbelief and anger was particularly sharp from residents of Staten Island \u2013 the borough worst hit by Monday's storm.</p> <p>In a joint statement with New York Road Runners, Bloomberg said: \"While holding the race would not require diverting resources from the recovery effort, it is clear that it has become the source of controversy and division.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We cannot allow a controversy over an athletic event \u2013 even one as meaningful as this \u2013 to distract attention away from all the critically important work that is being done to recover from the storm and get our city back on track.\"</p> <p>The statement added that disappointed participants would receive additional information in the days ahead. They will now have to wait 12 months if they are to run the annual New York race.</p> <p>Some are not waiting until then for their chance to complete a marathon.</p> <p>Brooke Wood, 31, is one of those who searched elsewhere for a race to run after Bloomberg's change of mind was made public.</p> <p>Originally from Australia but now living in Brooklyn, Wood said she wanted to do the right thing by those who had donated to the cause she was running for \u2013 the SLE Lupus Foundation.</p> <p>As such she opted for the Anthem Richmond Marathon, due to be staged next Saturday.</p> <p>On Saturday, the website for the Richmond race noted that the cancellation of the New York Marathon had resulted in a \"surge\" of entries. As a result of the increased numbers, participants would have to wait for finisher medals to be posted to them in the mail, organaisers noted.</p> <p>For those who have dedicated a sizable chunk of the year getting their body ready for the ultimate running test, it was a small price to pay.</p> <p>\"Doing Richmond means I won't let four months of training go to waste, and it leaves New York City to focus on other critical things right now,\" Wood said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, others are opting for an unauthorised route to the finish line. A Facebook group calling itself Run Anyway Marathon is calling on runners to go ahead with their plans to run the 26.2 miles, by lapping Central Park four times.</p> <p>In a mission statement, the online community group states: \"In respect to those in need, cancelling the NYC marathon was the right move. But for those of us who are running for causes or for others, we should finish what we started.</p> <p>\"We will do it like the old days where we run the necessary amount of times around Central Park to complete 26.2 miles.\"</p> <p>According to the Facebook page, four makeshift aid stations will be set up along the route for those willing to take part.</p>",
  "<p>When Barack Obama was contemplating a run for the White House his wife, Michelle, asked him what he thought he could accomplish if he won. \"The day I take the oath of office,\" he replied. \"The world will look at us differently. And millions of kids across this country will look at themselves differently. That alone is something.\"</p> <p>Four months after he was sworn in, at least one kid saw himself differently. It was May 2009 and 5-year-old Jacob Philadelphia had gone with his dad, a black ex-marine, to the Oval Office for a family photograph with the president. </p> <p>With him were his mum, Roseanne, and his older brother, Isaac, 8. The boys were allowed to ask Obama one question each. The parents had no idea what they were going to say. Isaac asked why the president had got rid of the F-22 jet fighter. The president said because it cost too much. Jacob asked:</p> <p>\"I want to know if my hair is just like yours.\"</p> <p>He was so quiet, Obama asked him to repeat the question. Jacob obliged.</p> <p>Obama said: \"Why don't you touch it and see for yourself?\"</p> <p>He bent down lowered his head so that it was within Jacob's reach.</p> <p>Jacob paused. The president prompted. \"Touch it, dude!\" he said</p> <p>Jacob reached out and rubbed the presidential pate.</p> <p>\"So, what do you think?\" Mr Obama asked.</p> <p>\"Yes, it does feel the same,\" Jacob said.</p> <p>The White House photographer <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/24/us/politics/indelible-image-of-a-boys-pat-on-obamas-head-hangs-in-white-house.html\">snapped the moment</a>. \"Every couple of weeks the White House photographers change out the photos in the West Wing,\" Michelle Obama <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/the-obama-haircut/2012/10/25/efc1d556-1ea2-11e2-9746-908f727990d8_video.html\">said at a fundraiser in September</a>. \"Except for that one. So if you ever wonder whether change is possible, I want you think of that little black boy in the Oval Office of the White House touching the head of the first black president.\"</p> <p>The symbolic resonance of Obama's victory for black Americans has not diminished. At rallies the hawkers are still there with T-shirts setting him alongside Martin Luther King, setting his logo within Superman's crest or insisting: \"I like my coffee black. Like my president\". According to Gallup 90% of African Americans intend to back him and they plan to turn out at the same rate as white voters. No other block of voters is more loyal.</p> <p>No other block of voters is <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/behind-the-numbers/2011/02/race_and_recession_poll_aa_opt.html\">more optimistic</a>. Over the past few years polls have <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/19/AR2011021903265.html\">consistently shown</a> that African Americans are more likely than any other group to be bullish about their own future, to think the country's best days are yet to come and that the economy is already recovering.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2010/01/12/blacks-upbeat-about-black-progress-prospects/\">Pew survey</a> in January 2010 indicated that the percentage of black Americans who thought blacks were better off than they were five years before had almost doubled since 2007. There were also significant increases in the percentages who believed the standard-of-living gap between whites and blacks was decreasing. No wonder they love the president.</p> <p>There was only one trouble with these assessments. They weren't true. African Americans, as a group, are far worse off now than they were when Obama came to power and the gap between whites and blacks in terms of wealth and income has increased under Obama's tenure. The overall rate of unemployment may be close to where it was when Obama took office, but black unemployment is up 11%. Meanwhile <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/21/news/economy/wealth-gap-race/index.htm?iid=EL\">the wealth gap has doubled</a> during this recession with the average white American now having 22 times more wealth than their black counterparts. So too has the educational achievement gap with the rate at which white Americans graduate from high school growing at a far faster clip than black students.</p> <p>\"We haven't seen much of the stimulus trickle down to our people here,\" Mark Allen, a Chicago-based community organiser who used to work alongside Obama, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/for-obama-acquaintance-change-was-not-enough/2012/08/16/92deaf86-e7d8-11e1-a3d2-2a05679928ef_gallery.html\">told the Washington Post</a>. \"I liked the community organiser Obama better than President Obama \u2026 Democrats say Barack has got 90% or whatever of the black vote wrapped up. What they don't tell you is it's 90% of those who actually come out and vote. What if it's 90% of just 30 or 40% who vote?\"</p> <p>In short, Jacob's odds of getting a decent job when he gets older actually got worse since he felt the president's hair, while the gap between his life chances and his white schoolmates widened and his odds of going to prison remained pretty much the same. In empirical terms \"the change that [has been] possible\" for Jacob and his family under Obama has been change for the worse. One can argue about the cause of those changes and the degree to which Obama bears any responsibility for either creating them or fixing them. But one cannot argue about the fact of them: the ascent of America's first black president has coincided with the one of the steepest descents of the economic fortunes of black Americans since the second world war both in real terms and relative to whites.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398880173\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/07/10/0710_jesse_460x276.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and Jesse Jackson\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Then-senator Barack Obama with Reverend Jesse Jackson in 2007.

The group that has fared worse under Obama is not only the group most likely to support him but also the most likely to feel optimistic about the deteriorating situation in which they find themselves. And why has that loyalty to the president yet to be fully tested? What do they know that the numbers don't show?</p> <p>Discussing this dilemma within the black community can be tantamount to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/oct/02/younge-america-obama-black-vote-video\">heresy</a>. Wagons circle, messengers are shot, ranks close, critical faculties are suspended. \"Too many black intellectuals have given up the hard work of thinking carefully in public about the crisis facing black America,\" Princeton professor Eddie Glaude <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/opinion/sunday/the-price-of-a-black-president.html?ref=todayspaper&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">told fellow academic Fred Harris recently</a>. \"We have either become cheerleaders for President Obama or self-serving pundits.\" Not only are criticisms shunned but even constructive critiques are unwelcome. At times it seems like questions as to how his tenure has affected black communities either should not be asked or, at the very least, should not be answered honestly. </p> <p>\"I have friends,\" says Virginia state delegate, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/oct/02/younge-america-obama-black-vote-video\">Onzlee Ware</a> from Roanoke, who is an ardent Obama supporter, \"who, if I bring [his shortcomings] up as an intellectual conversation, they say I'm a traitor.\"</p> <p>There are some sound reasons for this. The first is the overt racism that Obama has faced from a significant portion both of the political class and the public as a whole. There are plenty of reasons why one might oppose Obama that have nothing to do with race. When you look at how the things they accused the Clintons of \u2013 killing people, smuggling drugs from abroad, embezzling \u2013 the Obama's are not unique in being the targets of a right wing hyper-caffeinated lie machine.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the nature of these particular lies and attacks have, as often as not, been <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/165576/gops-blatant-racism \">rooted in race</a>. Half of white Americans in one Pew survey shared the birthers' doubt that Obama was born in this country. The percentage of Americans who believed he is a Muslim has doubled since he took office. After the president produced his long-form birth certificate, Donald Trump demanded his college transcripts (claiming he was not smart enough to get into an Ivy League school). Newt Gingrich branded him the \"food stamp president\". Southern congressmen shout \"liar\" while he's speaking, Romney surrogates question his connection to \"Anglo-Saxon values\". </p> <p>Far from his election signalling a post-racial era of equality it has exposed and unleashed a visceral level of intolerance that has produced the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/poll-shows-widening-racial-gap-in-presidential-contest/2012/10/25/9d5be0d4-1ed1-11e2-9cd5-b55c38388962_story.html\">most racially polarised</a> electorate for at least a generation. Having alienated blacks and Latinos, a recent poll revealed that Romney's support is 91% white \u2013 that's a higher proportion than any candidate since Bush's father stood in 1988 and may yet surpass it.</p> <p>Meanwhile a recent <a href=\"http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/27/14740413-ap-poll-majority-harbor-prejudice-against-blacks?lite\">AP poll</a> revealed that, if anything, racist attitudes have hardened in the country since Obama's election. The poll showed that \"51% of Americans now express explicit anti-black attitudes, compared with 48% in a similar 2008 survey\". The proportion who express anti-Hispanic feelings is roughly the same. That's within the margin of error. But what's clear is that it's not going down. Anyone who seriously believes Obama's election ushered in a new period of racial harmony simply hasn't been paying attention.</p> <p>In this atmosphere many African Americans become understandably defensive. Under such sustained racial onslaught the space for free-wheeling conversation and constructive criticism becomes limited because the issue has shifted from what Obama has done to who he is. Given the nature of the attacks the need to defend Obama's right to be in office at all eclipses any more nuanced conversation about his actual record.</p> <p>Moreover much of the criticism Obama has faced from the black community has been either ridiculous or self-defeating. Last year former Princeton professor Cornel West <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/88521/cornell-west-uncovers-the-disturbing-truth#\">led a well-publicised assault</a> insisting that Obama has \"a certain fear of free black men\". </p> <p>\"It's understandable,\" he said. \"As a young brother who grows up in a white context, brilliant African father, he's always had to fear being a white man with black skin. All he has known culturally is white. He is just as human as I am, but that is his cultural formation. When he meets an independent black brother, it is frightening ... He has a certain rootlessness, a deracination. It is understandable.\"</p> <p>Essentialising Obama's racial and cultural makeup in such a way makes the very mistake that the right makes \u2013 assessing Obama not on what he does but by who he is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398880174\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347526519965/b2c9ac06-290a-45e7-8390-16afcdacadae-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Mona Renee Johnson weeps as President Barack Obama speaks at a campaign rally last night in Las Vegas, Nevada.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mona Renee Johnson weeps as Obama speaks at a campaign rally in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KEVIN LAMARQUE/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It also harps back to an era of black political leadership, where black politicians emerged from the church or historically black colleges, and fought not to win office outside the black community (white people wouldn't vote for them) but to put the needs of that community on the agenda. There was, in a previous generation, a sense of ownership that black communities had over their politicians that no longer exists. This is partly progress. Ivy League universities will admit them, corporations will hire them, funds will come to them, white people will now vote for them. A whole range of opportunities are open to politicians of Obama's generation that were created by Cornel West's generation.</p> <p>But that, in turn, has changed what it means to be a black politician and what, if anything, we mean when <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/obama-effect\">we talk about black politics</a>. Unlike, say, Jesse Jackson or Martin Luther King, Obama was not politically produced by the black community, but presented to it after he had made his way through the mostly white elites. His political ties to the black community are not organic but symbolic. His arrival in the political class is hailed as the progress of a community when in fact it is the advancement of an individual. </p> <p>\"[Obama] is being consumed as the embodiment of color blindness,\" Angela Davis, professor of history of consciousness at the University of California, Santa Cruz, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/nov/08/usa.gender\">told me in late 2007</a>. \"It's the notion that we have moved beyond racism by not taking race into account. That's what makes him conceivable as a presidential candidate. He's become the model of diversity in this period \u2026 a model of diversity as the difference that makes no difference. The change that brings no change.\"</p> <p>That is why criticisms of him for \"not doing enough for his own people\" both miss and devalue the point. The demand to close the racial gaps bequeathed by centuries of discrimination is not a sectional interest but a national one. Demands for equality and racial justice should be made to any president of whatever race or party. </p> <p>Obama should do more for black people \u2013 not because he is black but because black people are the citizens suffering most. Black people have every right to make demands on Obama \u2013 not because they're black but because they gave him a greater percentage of their votes than any other group, and he owes his presidency to them. Like any president, he should be constantly pressured to put the issue of racial injustice front and centre and if black people aren't going to apply that pressure then nobody else will.</p> <p>But in fact precisely the opposite has been happening. With Obama in the White House African Americans representatives have been backpedalling. Black politicians, too, have held their fire. </p> <p>\"With 14% unemployment, if we had a white president we'd be marching around the White House,\" said the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), Emmanuel Cleaver. \"The president knows we are going to act in deference to him in a way we wouldn't to someone white.\" That's pathetic and counterproductive. These are the very people who are now showing up with empty hands and trying to galvanise the black community to go to the polls.</p> <p>Their reticence is partly explained by the fear of a backlash. \"If we go after the president too hard, you're going after us,\" Maxine Waters, a California Democrat in the House, told a largely black audience in Detroit last year. But then that's what leadership is about. Explaining to those audiences that there are large numbers of people lobbying for Obama's attention, including people with huge amounts of money and power. If the black community wants it they must demand it.</p> <p>Some have spoken out. In August after a month-long round of job fairs organised by the CBC across the nation John Conyers, the longest serving black American in Congress <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21563718\">said</a>. \"We want [Obama] to know from this day forward that we've had it. We want him to come out on our side and advocate, and not to watch and wait \u2026 We're suffering.\" Unfortunately it was followed by little in the way of action.</p> <p>In the absence of that pressure Obama has felt little need to focus his attention on the problem, even rhetorically. In his first two years in office he talked about race less than any Democratic president since 1961. In all of his state of the union speeches he mentioned poverty just three times: last year's was the first since 1948 to not mention poverty or the poor at all. When he did talk about it it was to preach <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jul/19/us-race-obama-speech\">better parenting, healthy meals and greater discipline</a>.</p> <p>At a Congressional Black Caucus meeting in September he <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/michelle-singletary-obamas-unfortunate-remarks-on-peoples-misfortunes/2011/09/27/gIQAXpau2K_story.html\">told his former colleagues</a>: \"Take off your bedroom slippers, put on your marching shoes. Shake it off. Stop complaining, stop grumbling, stop crying.\" Compare that to the meeting he had with bankers not long after he was elected when they thought he was going to impose serious regulation. \"I'm the only thing standing between you and the pitchforks. I'm not out there to go after you,\" he told them. \"I'm protecting you.\"</p> <p>This would not be the first time that the black Americans have shown great loyalty to a Democratic president who did not return the favour. Bill Clinton is still revered even though when he ran in 1992 he made a special trip back to Arkansas to oversee the <a href=\"http://www.talkleft.com/story/2008/1/24/105451/284 \">execution</a> of Ricky Ray Rector \u2013 a black, lobotomised inmate so mentally incapacitated that when given his last meal, he opted to save the dessert for after the execution. When in power he signed off on a welfare reform that would prove devastating to large numbers of black families, especially women. He presided over an economic boom. Obama does not even have that.</p> <p>It may be in this mixture of realism and low expectations that one can understand the logic of optimism in harder times. That black Americans are doing worse than everyone else, and that the man they elected to turn that around has not done so, does not fundamentally change their view of how American politics works; almost every other Democratic president has failed in a similar way while Republicans have not even tried to succeed. </p> <p>Conversely the fact that a black man might be elected president, that enough white people might vote for him and that nobody has shot him, really has changed their assumptions about what is possible. Jacob's story from the Oval Office is new and inspiring; the story of his odds of success beyond that moment are wearily familiar.</p> <p>The day Obama took office, the world may have looked at black America differently, but black America has yet to look at Obama differently. When he went from being an aspiration to a fact of political life, the posters that bore his likeness in socialist realist style over single-word commands like Hope, Believe and Change should have been replaced with posters bearing the single-word statement: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jan/19/obama-inauguration\">power</a>. As Frederick Douglass said: \"Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.\"</p>",
  "<p>They are images from the golden age of space exploration: thousands of rare photographs recording the early days of manned flight into space. The collection, to be sold at auction this month, is the largest on the subject ever offered on the open market.</p> <p>It features more than 4,500 shots from the days when rockets were little more than guided missiles, adapted to carry a passenger or two instead of a warhead, through to the sudden sunset of manned moonshots in the 1970s.</p> <p>The photographs were amassed by a European collector. They are to be sold in just two large lots in Vienna and have an estimate of \u20ac400,000-\u20ac600,000 (\u00a3320,000-\u00a3480,000).</p> <p>The images shed fresh light on the extraordinary period of technological advance and human achievement that sprang from the struggle between the US and the former Soviet Union.</p> <p>As well as familiar pictures, such as a colour shot of Buzz Aldrin alone on the lunar surface, which became one of the world's most reproduced photographs, the collection contains hundreds of black-and-white documentary shots of astronauts and technicians, which reveal the fatigue, boredom and fear that was the true face of the space race.</p> <p>The space race was eventually won by the Apollo 11 mission of July 1969, witnessed by a television audience of around half a billion entranced by blurred, black-and-white images of Neil Armstrong, who died in August, taking a giant leap for mankind.</p> <p>It was an expensive win for America: the Apollo flights alone consumed an estimated $100bn (in present values). A reliable estimate of the total bill to US taxpayers for manned spaceflight, from the earliest Mercury launches to the final shuttle mission, is in the region of $486bn.</p> <p>\"During the space race, people tended to compare Neil Armstrong to Christopher Columbus,\" says Dr Roger Launius, senior curator of human spaceflight at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, Washington DC. \"That Armstrong, like Columbus, would open up this vast new territory to, I guess, western European activity. I tend to think that, as time has passed, we may more effectively refer to Armstrong as like Leif Ericson, who reached America hundreds of years before Columbus, but that did not lead to an opening up of that territory to European expansion.</p> <p>\"It may be who knows how long before there will be any real exploitation [of new frontiers in space]. It may be not be in any serious way in our lifetimes.\"</p> <p>Launius added: \"Space shuttle astronauts are not the kind of dashing, daredevil types that was the persona of the early astronauts.</p> <p>\"You don't have that with people who are mostly scientists. But the astronauts who flew with the shuttles look a whole lot more like the rest of the world in terms of demographics than the white, male Americans who went to the Moon ever did.\"</p>"
