Drummers clatter behind him, their music held on the edge of orbit and then, afterwards, he pleads with the audience at Cafe Oto in&#xa0;London, to \"knit your hearts together\", to fight sexism and racism.&#xa0;This is not your average free-jazz performance.</p> <p>Born Leo Smith in 1941, this part-time teacher and ethnomusicolgist added the name Wadada when he became a Rastafarian in the early 1980s, and then preceded this with Ishmael after converting to Islam the following decade. Not only did he keep his former names, he kept the dreads, now salt-and-pepper flecked. Currently a faculty member at the Herb Alpert School of Music at the California Institute of the Arts, Smith has released scores of recordings over the years \u2013 but only now has he finished his life's major work, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/album/b22bbe50-de0a-47d9-9e94-90e3e541d297\" title=\"\">Ten Freedom Summers</a>, which he began in 1977 and is now releasing as a four-CD box set.</p> <p>Smith started out playing in school marching bands in Mississippi, before moving on to blues and R&amp;B, styles he talks about with deep respect. \"Robert Johnson's blues,\" he says when we meet, holding forth with the air of a mystic. \"That's as heavy as Nietzsche talking about life and death.\"</p> <p>He blossomed in the crucible of late 1960s Chicago to become a major figure in free jazz, surrounded by fellow sonic&#xa0;explorers including Henry Threadgill, Roscoe Mitchell and Anthony Braxton. \"He found another way to organise music,\" Threadgill tells me. \"The actual realisation of that [music] on an improvisational level is still something that the individual players have to deal with, but he's got a landscape and a way of negotiating through that landscape that he can put in front of you, and then it's up to you to navigate that. He always had his own way of doing things.\"</p> <p>Smith joined the boundary-pushing jazz organisation, <a href=\"http://aacmchicago.org/\" title=\"\">the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM)</a>, and was \"hazed\" by the other members, who talked loudly through his first performance as a sort of initiation ritual. \"I felt it was very mean-spirited and it pissed me off completely,\" he remembers. \"And I played stronger, and I played stronger, and finally they all bust back on stage and joined me. And after that you kind of know you belong there. They've put you out in the water by yourself, you've swam across this vast ocean of whatever the expectation was, and you've conquered it.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F45716391&amp;amp;show_artwork=true\"> <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F45716391&amp;show_artwork=true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Listen to Song: Martin Luther King, Jr. (excerpt) from Ten Freedom Summers </p> <p>With Ten Freedom Summers, Smith originally set out to document a decade of civil rights activism, from the Brown v Board of Education trial of 1954, which ruled that separate schools for black and white students were unconstitutional, to the signing of the Civil Rights Act in 1964. But his span grew to encompass <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott\" title=\"\">African-American slave Dred Scott's unsuccessful legal challenge against slavery in 1857</a> and the events of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/11/911-ground-zero-american-century\" title=\"\">9/11</a>, taking in the Vietnam War, JFK's assassination, and what he calls \"the myth of a free press\" along the way. \"I wanted to identify that the black experience <em>is</em> American experience,\" he says, keen for it not to be seen as \"a kind of racial isolation\".</p> <p>Each piece uses a single event as its focus. The Freedom Riders Ride, for instance, tackles the murder of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner at the hands of the police and the Ku Klux Klan, after they took part in interstate bus journeys that challenged segregation on public transport. \"It's about that ride, the contemplation, anticipation and anxiety. I start with the point where they see the headlights and the police car stops. I don't try and make a pictorial image, I look for the psychological thread \u2013 what did they feel, in my imagination, and what do I feel, from their experience?\"The pieces are performed by his Golden Quartet ensemble, improvising jazz musicians that Wadada has played with for decades, along with and the Southwest Chamber Music, a 10-person outfit; the score is a blend of&#xa0;standard&#xa0;notation, with space for free improvisation, and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNrQ7Pdij0w\" title=\"\">Ankhrasmation</a>, a symbolic and pictographic method of scoring developed by Smith himself in the late 60s. To get the orchestral performers to improvise, he simply wrote music that was impossible to play. \"My instruction to them was: while you're playing this and you cannot completely play it correctly, keep going forward. At some point, it's going to break down completely \u2013 and at that point you're improvising.\"</p> <p>The result is extraordinarily moving \u2013 the freedom of the playing, and the democratic process of group improvisation, emulates the freedoms&#xa0;the civil rights movement was fighting for. So</p> <p>Is America's hostility to Muslims a new challenge? \"It's constantly creating new membership into Islam,\" he replies. \"People say: why do they hate Muslims so much? And they get in there and see this teaching is different from how it's perceived from the outside.\"</p> <p>And w, with a black man in the White House, have the battles sketched out in Ten Freedom Summers been won? \"When Barack Obama was elected,\" says Smith, \"it immediately brought out all the differences in society. He's been called a new Hitler, the devil in return, he's been called nigger. I relate this kind of stuff to growing pains: when a child has a tantrum, they're&#xa0;learning how to respect the rule of law.\" He cites \"very bright\" black politicians like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/nov/03/us-midterm-elections-2010-usa\" title=\"\">Deval Patrick</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/28/cory-booker-chris-christie-irresistible-force\" title=\"\">Cory Booker</a> as being part of a new generation: \"They know the sky's the limit now.\"</p> <p>Smith, who is now 70, recently recorded an album of duets with South African drummer Louis Moholo-Moholo, put together as the pair toured&#xa0;from the Azores to Finland. \"I've got that Beethoven energy, that Stravinsky energy,\" he grins. \"And it's all a gift from the Creator.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 Ten Freedom Summers is out on Cuneiform. Ancestors, with Louis Moholo-Moholo, is out October 18 on TUM.

  "<p>Frankel's final race in the QIPCO Champion Stakes at Ascot next month will unfold in front of a sell-out crowd of 32,000 after the creation of an extra 1,500 spaces for spectators in a marquee alongside the track's main grandstand. However, with no further increases to the capacity planned, some fans who would have wanted to attend are likely to be locked out.</p> <p>Ascot is licensed to hold crowds of up to 80,000, and frequently does so at its showpiece Royal meeting in June each year, but many are accommodated in temporary hospitality facilities. These are in place for the full five days of the meeting and are not cost-effective for a single Saturday afternoon in mid-October.</p> <p>Tickets for the new temporary facility, to be called the Champions Bar, will be on sale from Monday, and can also be purchased as an upgrade by racegoers who have already paid for a grandstand ticket.</p> <p>The attendance for next month's meeting will still be a significant increase on the 26,000 who watched the first British Champions Day last year, when Frankel took the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. Sir Henry Cecil's colt has since gone on to establish himself as a great champion and he is long odds-on to extend his unbeaten record to 14 races in his final start.</p> <p>\"We have worked closely with Ascot to decide on the final capacity,\" Rod Street, the chief executive of British Champions Series, said. \"The priority for us is that racegoers have an enjoyable and comfortable day and want to come back.\"</p> <p>Aloof, a 12-1 chance trained by David Wachman, took the Group Three Danny Cordell Lavarack &amp; Lanwades Stud Fillies' Stakes at Gowran Park on Sunday. Momentary, a rare runner for The Queen in Ireland, made most of the running but Aloof finished strongly for Billy Lee, her jockey, to win by three-quarters of a length. Shebella was third, with Aloof's stable companion Esentepe fourth and Momentary fading into fifth.</p>",
  "<p>Andrew Mitchell will hold on to his position as chief whip unless more damaging details emerge about his angry confrontation with police in Downing Street, David Cameron has decided.</p> <p>As his cabinet colleague Eric Pickles mocked Mitchell by describing himself as \"proud\" to be a pleb \u2013 the term Mitchell denies calling officers \u2013 the prime minister made it clear his support was conditional.</p> <p>Government sources said Cameron would stand by Mitchell, who was appointed chief whip in the recent reshuffle, unless there were further developments. Sources said there were no excuses for Mitchell's behaviour, which has prompted a difficult few days for the government.</p> <p>Mitchell has admitted swearing in front of officers who declined, on security grounds, to let him leave through the main Downing Street gates on his bicycle on Wednesday night. But he insisted he used the word \"fucking\" to express frustration and did not direct the word at the police.</p> <p>The public school-educated chief whip has emphatically denied accusations by unnamed police officers that he called them \"plebs\". Mitchell's position would be untenable if he was proved to have used the word, because it would lend support to Labour claims that the Tory leadership regards public servants \u2013 even those charged with guarding the prime minister \u2013 as socially inferior.</p> <p>The chief whip's explanation cut no ice with Labour. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said that the confirmation that Mitchell had sworn in front of police guarding Downing Street merited an investigation by Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary.</p> <p>Cooper said: \"We now know that Andrew Mitchell swore at police officers who were doing their job protecting Downing Street. This is completely unacceptable behaviour from a cabinet minister, and a half-hearted private apology is clearly insufficient. Given the justified anger and concern from police officers of all ranks, Mr Mitchell should apologise publicly immediately.'</p> <p>In the first detailed response by a Conservative cabinet minister, the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, said he accepted Mitchell's explanation that he did not use the word \"plebs\". But he mocked Mitchell when he told the BBC Sunday Politics: \"He's never used it in my presence, but then again I'm very proud myself to be a pleb.\"</p> <p>The most authoritative account of Mitchell's side of his confrontation with the police was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/9559658/I-dont-believe-that-Andrew-Mitchell-let-loose-the-explosive-P-word.html\" title=\"\">published by the Sunday Telegraph</a>. In his weekly column, Matthew d'Ancona wrote that Mitchell has admitted that he swore, though it was not aimed directly at the police.</p> <p>The paper reports that Mitchell admitted muttering in earshot of the police: \"You guys are supposed to fucking help us.\"</p> <p>Mitchell has let it be known he used the word \"adjectivally\" and was not directing it at the police.</p> <p>Mitchell's explanation may raise questions about the statement he issued on Thursday night when the Sun reported that he had sworn at police and had called them \"plebs\". In the statement, Mitchell said he did not accept he had used the words attributed to him. One of those words was \"fucking\".</p> <p>The Sun reported Mitchell as saying: \"Best you learn your fucking place. You don't run this fucking government. You're fucking plebs.\" The newspaper also reported an eyewitness as saying that Mitchell had described the police as \"morons\".</p> <p>The chief whip, who ran David Davis's unsuccessful Tory leadership campaign in 2005, is known to have a quick temper. But friends said he would never use the words morons or plebs.</p> <p>Mitchell was given a boost on Sunday when the Liberal Democrats declined to call for his resignation. Nick Clegg mirrored No 10's thinking when he said that a line should be drawn under the matter unless more details emerged.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1: \"I think unless something comes to light about the rival versions about what was and what wasn't said that I don't know about \u2013 I think he should apologise, apologise in full, he's done that \u2013 and [then] draw a line under it in that way.\"</p> <p>But Clegg was highly critical of Mitchell. \"I think that civility, being courteous to the police is important at all times. But of course it's especially important given the tragic events \u2013 the killing of Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes. So what Andrew Mitchell did was wrong, very wrong. He knows that and he's apologised to the police and explained himself and I think he was right to do so.\"</p> <p>Tim Farron, the Lib Dem president, told Sky News that Mitchell's remarks were \"utterly, utterly dreadful\".</p>",
  "<p>The 2012 election may be far from decided, but on Sunday all the speculation centered on the 2016 race, and whether a certain household Democrat name might once again feature on the ballot paper.</p> <p>The prospect of a Hillary Clinton run for the White House gained momentum when Bill Clinton offered the broadest hint yet that she might go for it.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton is due to stand down soon as secretary of state, probably in January, and take at least six months out to write her memoirs about her time in office. After that, she will make up mind whether she will run, according to the Clinton camp.</p> <p>Aged 64, she is still young enough for a bid in 2016 and is, at present, ahead of any of her rivals in terms of standing and popularity inside the party. She retains a driving desire to become the first female president.</p> <p>Other senior Democrats, including at least three governors, are already positioning themselves for a run \u2013 and vice-president Joe Biden might fancy his chances too \u2013 but Hillary Clinton has much more stature.</p> <p>Bill Clinton, in an interview with Face The Nation, talked up her achievements and said she would be well placed.</p> <p>\"I've never met anybody I thought was any better than her at this. But again, we got a lot of able people in our party who want to be president,\" he said.<br>Asked directly if she would stand, he opted against ruling it out and said: \"I don't know.\"</p> <p>Clinton, after coming off second-best to Barack Obama in the early stages of the 2008 Democratic nomination battle, won over many in the Democratic party with her stubborn refusal to quit. In a dignified and touching exit speech, she expressed thanks for the 18m votes she had received, portraying them as a step foward in women's fight for equality. </p> <p>In words that might yet find an echo in 2016, she said: \"Although we weren't able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it's got about 18m cracks in it. And the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time.\"</p> <p>Her popularity has grown over the last four years within the party, not least because of her loyalty to Obama. There have been no leaks or sniping from her office, and she is viewed as an effective and popular secretary of state.</p> <p>In writing her memoirs, she intends to retain that loyalty, sticking rigidly to her time as secretary of state rather than her version of the bruising battle with Obama in 2007 and 2008, according to the Clinton camp.</p> <p>Bill Clinton helped burnish the Clinton brand earlier this month in a keynote speech at the Democratic convention in which he made the case for a second term for Obama and joked that Obama was such a decent politician he had even appointed Hillary.</p> <p>In his interview, Clinton talked of how hard his wife had been working over hte last two decades. \"You know she's worked hard for 20 years. We had eight years in the White House. Then she ran for the senate. She served in New York for eight years. Then she immediately became the secretary of state, and she's tired,\" he said.</p> <p>\"She's really worked hard. I think she's done a fabulous job. I'm very proud of her. But she wants to take some time off, kind of regroup, write a book. I hope we'll be working together.\"</p> <p>He said he would support his wife whatever she decided to do.</p> <p>\"She's an extraordinarily able person. I've never met anybody I thought was a better public servant. But I have no earthly idea what she'll decide to do.\" </p> <p>After finishing her memoirs of her time in office, she may opt to do some charitable work, either for Bill Clinton's foundation or start something similar of her own. But she would need to begin organising for a presidential run in about two years from now.</p> <p>If Obama secures a second term and benefits from economic recovery, Clinton could find herself well-placed for the White House. If it is Mitt Romney presidency and the economy improves, it might be harder facing a Republican incumbent.</p> <p>If Romney loses, the Republicans have a long list of potential stars ready to run, including Florida senator Marco Rubio, Romney's running-mate Paul Ryan and former Florida governor Jeb Bush.</p> <p>Speculation about who might run for the Democrats is already rife in the party. Vice-president Joe Biden, 69, assuming Obama gets a second term, might feel that eight years at the White House entitles him to at least consideration.<br>According to a report in the New York Times on Sunday, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, wants to run but told an adviser: \"First, I've got to figure out what Hillary is doing.\" The paper went on to quote a Cuomo spokesman denying he had said this and insisting he was not positioning himself for a run.</p> <p>The governor of Massachusetts, Deval Patrick, has already made a visit to Iowa this year, usually a sign of an impending bid, given the first of the Democratic caucuses is traditionally held in the state. Martin O'Malley, the governor of Maryland, another potential contender, spoke in Iowa earlier this month at a big Democratic event, the annual steak fry of senator Tom Harkin.</p>"
