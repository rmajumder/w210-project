  "<p>Call of Duty Elite, the social online gaming service for Activision's blockbusting shooter series is to go completely free. Introduced last year to provide fans of the series with stats, challenges and linear content, Elite originally offered some free functionality together with a premium subscription package. With the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 on 13 November, however, all the Elite features will be free. </p> <p>All, that is, except for map packs, the regular download packages containing new multiplayer environments. As with previous Call of Duty titles, four of these will be released in the year following the launch of Black Ops 2, and they'll be available separately or for one discounted price via a season pass. The DLC will appear on xbox first, at 1200 each or 4000 points for the season pass.</p> <p>\"For us it simply comes down to the fact that Call of Duty is at its best when our community is united,\" said Activision CEO,Eric Hirshberg, speaking exclusively to The Guardian. \"This is why we're returning to four map pack drops per year as well as why we're making services such as leveling clans and Elite TV available to a wider Call of Duty community for Black Ops 2, not just to Elite premium subscribers. </p> <p>\"From the start, our goal with Elite was to make multiplayer a more social, more connected experience. And we have accomplished that, but for our premium members. We've come to the conclusion that Elite has more value as a community-wide platform driving engagement and connectivity, rather than as a paid members-only service\".</p> <p>For Black Ops 2, Elite developer Beachhead will be evolving some key features as well as bringing in some fresh additions. The Player HQ area will house all the gameplay stats, including heat maps of recent multiplayer encounters, as well as challenges. Here, users will also be able to manage the new 'Pick Ten' create-a-class system, which lets players create custom soldier classes using points rather than the the usual set slots. There's also a Clan HQ where players can join or start new clans, and gain entry to clan competitions. </p> <p>There will also be support features for the game's popular Zombie mode, allowing fans to track their personal stats and compare them against undead fanatics across the world. \"Zombies Leaderboards and stats are probably among the most high profile new features,\" said Hirshberg. \"The Zombies community for Call of Duty is like no other, and they've asked for this going back to the original Elite beta. So, we're thrilled to deliver. The team is really excited about this.\"</p> <p>The linear content section of the service, Elite TV, is also returning, with an emphasis on videos showing developer tips, hints and stately guides. \"We've learned a lot with our first year of Elite TV,\" said Hirshberg. \"One of the things we've learned is that by far the most compelling content to our fans is content that helps them become better players. People also want content that makes our community the stars. So you will definitely see a greater community focus here. </p> <p>\"You can expect to see weapon and map tutorials on a whole new level. There will also be programming devoted to topics like Treyarch's new 'Pick 10' system as well as a variety of features designed to ease new fans into the basics of multiplayer. And of course we'll be delivering tips and tricks for more advanced players to continue to hone their skills as well\". </p> <p>According to Hirshberg, the social sharing element of Elite is also being updated. \"Starting with Black Ops 2, players will be able to share custom classes,\" he said. \"If you lose a match you can visit your Recent Matches history to review how your nemesis bested you. So you can click one button and copy their loadout over to your own custom class settings. One more click sends you directly to the game. </p> <p>\"Additionally, we're introducing push notifications to allow users to stay informed of certain events and communications on the go. Fans will also have the ability to share screenshots and videos directly to their Elite feed. And lastly, with the emphasis of Elite as your personal Call of Duty HQ, players can not only keep up on the latest news and information, but also share them to various social networks\".</p> <p>According to the press release, Modern Warfare 3 users will still get the two-tier service and subscribers will receive the extra content until their subscriptions run out. Presumably then, the service will be free on MW3 as well.</p> <p>With iPad support also on the way, Activision is looking to create much more of a pervasive service this time round, reflecting the emerging trend for cross-platform functionality in games. Although it suffered from a few technical problems at the outset, Elite has proved a popular service with over 12 million users, two million of those subscribing to the premium version. Some industry watchers are surprised that Activision has moved away from a monetised social gaming system \u2013 however, close rival EA does not charge for its own equivalent, Battlelog, available with the Battlefield 3 shooter. </p> <p>It seems that, like information, social functionality wants to be free.</p>",
  "<p>Havas Media's latest meaningful brands report has cast its eye towards brand Romney and brand Obama. In a survey of 378 adults distributed across the political who intended to vote in the 2012 presidential election, the conclusion of last week's report was that President Obama's meaningful brand attributes scored higher than Mitt Romney's, despite Romney victory and subsequent poll swings in the presidential debate.</p> <p>The Meaningful Brands survey looks specifically at how brands can help us live more fulfilled lives, feel more connected, less stressed, secure and positive about the future, and how different media platforms form those views. Obama was voted more meaningful than Romney both in terms of how he impacts voters' personal lives and the lives of the communities they care about.</p> <p>For more individual, personal concerns, Romney lags behind Obama by 10 percentage points (14% vs. 24%). When it comes to more collective, social issues surrounding the community or economy, Obama outpaces Romney by 15 percentage points (36% vs. 21%). However, the percentages for both candidates across both individual and collective indicators of wellbeing are low.</p> <p>While Obama is winning the meaningful brands race by a significant margin, but meaningful scores for both candidates are low. Romney is only considered meaningful by his core Conservative audience and is threatened by low scores from moderate Conservatives and middle of the road voters. Does this show that voters in the US do not think that either candidate is doing enough to help them live better lives? Do measures such as the Meaningful Brands analysis give us a different view of perceptions offered by traditional polling data?</p> <p>Umair Haque, Director Havas Media Labs, comments, 'There is optimism in the US but it's clear that both candidates are not delivering on this desire to live better lives in any sort of tangible form. Our Meaningful Brands project highlighted that the American public are looking to live more fulfilled valuable lives \u2013 we are all if you like on a quest for meaning. Even though Obama wins this week, it's clear with scores in the 20th and 30th percentiles that he has a long way to go before 'Brand Obama' becomes really meaningful \u2013 as both a President and a leader.'</p> <p>The results also confirm that Romney is not considered meaningful with anyone other than hardcore Conservatives. If isolating the focus on his core audiences, his scores across all 39 aspects of meaningfulness could challenge Obama \u2013 especially when speaking about business and the economy \u2013 but results show that he needs to convince people who are identified as the moderate conservatives or the 'middle of the road / swing votes' that his policies resonate in terms of generating more meaningful lives to voters.</p> <p>The survey confirms that Democrats are more social and digital than Republicans. During the debates, the liberal audience shared ideas on social media platforms to a greater extent than their Conservative counterparts and were more likely to spend at least an hour per day talking about the candidates and the election. Liberals were three to four times as likely to be actively posting or reading about the election during the debates.</p> <p>Hernan Sanchez CEO Havas Media Intelligence, concludes, 'It's no surprise that Facebook usage and digital platforms in general are used more prolifically by the Democrat voters. However, unless the real strategic issues of meaningfulness are addressed, these digital platforms will only help close short-term gaps. Having a more socially oriented group of voters can open up gains for Obama but it also can make Obama's brand more volatile.</p> <p>Unless these social platforms are used to enable people to live better, more connected and meaningful lives, these gains are short-lived.'</p> <p>Fast facts on meaningful scores for the first first of the weekly surveys:</p> <p>1. Overall, voter confidence for the future of the country is low, but 26% strongly agree that Obama helps them feel more confident vs. 19% Romney</p> <p>2. More Conservatives reported watching the debate on October 3rd (27% more Conservatives watched the debate than Liberals)</p> <p>3. The weekly TV debates in the run-up to the election are still considered meaningful to the majority of voters surveyed</p> <p>4. Aligned with the post-debate sentiment, 53% of the voters asked reported that their feelings shifted more favourably towards Romney following the debate</p> <p>5. 45% feel that Obama listens and cares \u2013 compared to only 20% with Romney</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398239417\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350307330212/obama-romney-brand-analys-001.jpg\" alt=\"obama romney brand analysis infographic\" width=\"462\" height=\"1460\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">  Photograph: Havas Media</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Havas Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>6. Obama is still scoring well on social issues, such as fair pay and equal opportunities, with over 40% of voters scoring him well in these areas compared to scores averaging 20% for Romney</p> <p>7. Romney achieves a small margin over Obama on business related areas, such as creation of jobs and development of business</p> <p>8. On more personal issues, 31% of recipients respondents strongly agree that Obama treats them with respect (compared to 15% for Romney)</p> <p>9. Overall, Obama doubles the scores of Romney on such issues as 'helping us become better citizens' and 'becoming more informed' \u2013 but these scores are still only averaging percentages in the mid 20s.</p> <p>10. The key potential problem areas for Obama are mainly economic \u2013 it's a close call on how each is considered to help us make our money grow (18% scores for Obama with Romney close on nearly 17%)</p> <p>11. Respondents were twice as likely to read/post about the election on Facebook compared to Twitter during the debate</p> <p>12. Twitter comes in at second with just under 8% overall. Once again we see huge differences between the two parties \u2013 16% of Liberals are using it compared to only 5% of Conservatives 13. Middle of the road voters were more likely to be reading the newspaper or listening to talk radio during the debates than any other political leaning group</p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> of the Guardian Media Network.

  "<p>This book contains all five books in The Spiderwick Chronicles. They are totally different from other fairy books that I have read, such as Artemis Fowl. This has a shape-shifting ogre by the name Mulgarath, fairies that give you addictive fruits, and brownies that (like me) love honey. They also have a bit of an anger issue.</p> <p>The plot is quite simple: The three Grace kids (Mallory, 13, Simon, 9, and his twin, Jared) move into a house owned by their great-aunt, Lucinda Spiderwick, who is in a nursing home. But the kids find there is something different about the house, mainly because there is something in the walls. </p> <p>Mallory tries to get it with the handle end of a broom, and uncovers a dumbwaiter (a small elevator used for delivering objects from, in this case, the kitchen to a study).</p> <p>The study belonged to Arthur Spiderwick, Lucida's father, who wrote a guide-book, about all the magic creatures in the world that we didn't know about, entitled: Arthur Spiderwick's Fantastical Guide To the World Around You.</p> <p>In it is all he could find out about every magical creature he knew from griffins to hobgoblins. This makes it a dangerous weapon. </p> <p>The evil ogre Mulgarath and his army of goblins want the book. With it the evil creature and his minions could destroy the world and everything we know. </p> <p>The Grace children have to protect the book at all costs, but when they discover their mother missing, they go on a quest to find her.</p> <p>A delight for anyone from 9-99 years of age, this book is a win in many ways.</p> <p><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you've read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></p>",
