Here is the latest dilemma \u2013 what are your thoughts?</p> <p><strong>I am 22 years old and have been in the same job since I was 16. I'm currently a supervisor in a large retail store, but am trying to change my career path as I don't wish to be in retail for the rest of my life. I am interested in working in a bank or something along similar lines, although I appreciate I would have to start at the bottom \u2013 perhaps as a cashier \u2013 and work my way up.</strong></p> <p><strong>My problem is that I never know what to write in the application when asked what skills and qualities I could bring to the position. I don't really know how to sell myself as I've only ever had the one interview/job application; all the rest were internal. I hope you can give me some tips and advice.</strong></p> <p>\u2022 For Jeremy's and readers' advice on a work issue, send a brief email to <a href=\"mailto:dear.jeremy@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"dear.jeremy@guardian.co.uk\">dear.jeremy@guardian.co.uk</a>.
