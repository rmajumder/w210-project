  "<p>The House of Commons is not representative of the electorate. The House of Commons has 650 MPs. Of these 650, there are 504 male MPs, so women are seriously underrepresented. There are 27 MPs of black and minority ethnic origin, but there would need to be 55 to 60 MPs to be representative of the black and minority ethnic population. There are a handful of disabled MPs, but there would need to be 65 disabled MPs to be representative of the number of disabled people in the population.</p> <p>Letting MPs serve on a job-share basis would enable more people from underrepresented groups to stand for parliament. Legal advice has been obtained by the Equality and Human Rights Commission on this issue and is available on Disability Politics UK's website.</p> <p>We want the law to be changed to allow MPs to serve on a job-share basis. An e-petition has been set up and a bill will be introduced in November. We urge readers to&#xa0;sign the e-petition (<a href=\"http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/38829\" title=\"\">http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/38829</a>) and write to their MPs to support the change in the law.<br><strong>John McDonnell MP </strong><em>Labour party</em><br><strong>Margaret Hodge MP </strong><em>Labour party</em><br><strong>Natalie Bennett </strong><em>Green Party leader </em><br><strong>Angela Mason </strong><em>Chair, The Fawcett Society</em><strong> </strong><br><strong>Simon Woolley </strong><em>Director, Operation Black Vote</em><br><strong>Miranda Whitehead </strong><em>Chair, Women Liberal Democrats</em><br><strong>Liz Sayce OBE </strong><em>Chief Executive, Disability Rights UK</em><br><strong>Sir Bert Massie CBE </strong><em>Former Chair, Disability Rights Commission</em><br><strong>Catherine Casserley </strong><em>Chair, Discrimination Law Association</em><br><strong>Kamaljeet Jandu GMB</strong><br><strong>Saraka Keating </strong><em>Chartered Society of Physiotherapy</em><br><strong>Sean McGovern </strong><em>Chair of the TUC Disabled Workers' Committee</em><br><strong>Diane Mulligan OBE </strong><em>Newly elected member of the CRPD Expert Committee</em><br><strong>Robin Allen QC </strong><em>Head of Cloisters chambers</em><br><strong>Mike Mansfield QC </strong><em>Head of Tooks Court Chambers</em><br><strong>John Cavanagh QC </strong><em>11 King's Bench Walk</em><br><strong>Sean Jones QC </strong><em>11 King's Bench Walk</em><br><strong>Claire Darwin </strong><em>Matrix Chambers</em><br><strong>Sara Mansoori </strong><em>Matrix Chambers</em><br><strong>Colm O'Cinneide </strong><em>University College London, Law Department</em><br><strong>Pam Walton </strong><em>Visiting Fellow, Sheffield Business School, Sheffield Hallam University</em><br><strong>Jo Brand </strong><em>Comedian</em><br><strong>Victoria Wright </strong><em>Disabled writer and actress </em><br><strong>Jenny Sealey MBE </strong><em>Artistic director, Graeae Theatre Company; Joint Artistic Director for the 2012 Paralympic Games </em><br><strong>Nicola Wildin </strong><em>Actress, Miranda in Paralympics Opening Ceremony</em><br><strong>Sally Bercow </strong><em>Labour Party member</em><br><strong>Katy Gordon </strong><em>Convenor, Scottish Women Liberal Democrats</em><br><strong>Rosalyn Gordon </strong><em>Chair, Liberal Democrat campaign for gender balance</em><br><strong>Dinti Batstone </strong><em>Vice-chair, Liberal Democrat campaign for gender balance</em><br><strong>Michael Rubenstein </strong><em>Equal Opportunities Review</em><br><strong>Lorraine Mann </strong><em>Campaigner for member of the Scottish Parliament job-sharing</em><br><strong>Moi Ali </strong><em>Author and communications consultant</em><br><strong>Dr Peter Jepson </strong><em>Originator of the All-women Shortlist Challenge</em><br><strong>Helen Dent </strong><em>Partner, Keoghs and Nicholls, Lindsell &amp; Harris solicitors</em><br><strong>Julie Morris </strong><em>Partner, Russell Jones and Walker solicitors</em><br><strong>Eddy Canfor-Dumas </strong><em>Author and screenwriter</em><br><strong>Eric Atwell </strong><em>Associate professor, Leeds University</em><br><strong>Jeanne Gregory </strong><em>Author, retired professor of gender studies</em><br><strong>Deborah Orr </strong><em>Guardian columnist</em><br><strong>Frances Ryan </strong><em>Guardian contributor</em><br><strong>Joe Kelly </strong><em>Contributor, Disability Arts online</em><br><strong>Shelagh Prosser</strong><br><strong>Michael Reiss </strong><em>Professor of science education and Church of England priest</em><br><strong>Dr Raj Persaud </strong><em>Consultant psychiatrist</em><br><strong>Robin Beecroft </strong><em>Fairtrade ambassador</em><br><strong>Adam Lotun </strong><em>Independent candidate, Corby by-election</em><br><strong>Deborah King </strong><em>Disability Politics UK</em></p>",
  "<p>A senior police officer faced a secret disciplinary hearing on Tuesday over allegations he used his position to secure a job for the daughter of the police authority chairman.</p> <p>Sean Price, who is suspended on full pay from Cleveland police, is accused of using \"undue\" influence to get a civilian job for Councillor Dave McLuckie's daughter. Both men were arrested last year as part of a multimillion-pound criminal investigation into alleged corrupt practices and misuse of public funds by the police authority. A court heard last week that the criminal investigation concerned allegations \"of a corrupt relationship\" between Price and the former Cleveland Police Authority chairman McLuckie.</p> <p>The ongoing criminal inquiry \u2013 led by an outside force \u2013 is running alongside the disciplinary proceedings against Price and his deputy, Derek Bonnard.</p> <p>Price's lawyers attempted in the high court last week to postpone the disciplinary hearing on the grounds that its outcome could prejudice the ongoing criminal investigation. He also attempted to change the makeup of the four-strong disciplinary panel.</p> <p>Documents presented to the high court last Friday revealed that it was alleged Price involved himself in the recruitment of McLuckie's daughter to a civilian role in order to \"curry favour\" with the ex-authority chief.</p> <p>It was further alleged that Price then lied about his involvement to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and also instructed his personal assistant, Frances Bage, to lie to the IPCC, according to high court documents.</p> <p>Lawyers for Price argued last Friday that the disciplinary hearing should be delayed until the conclusion of the wider investigation into criminal wrongdoing within the force and the police authority to avoid any risk of prejudice.</p> <p>The court heard that the criminal investigation concerned \"allegations of a corrupt relationship\" with McLuckie.</p> <p>But Price's bid to delay his disciplinary hearing and to alter the makeup of the panel failed and Mr Justice Irwin said the hearing could proceed.</p> <p>The panel, which will decide whether the allegations against Price amount to gross misconduct, includes a member of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, a member of the police authority, an independent member and a senior barrister, Joanna Greenberg QC. The hearing is expected to last a week.</p> <p>Price also faces a separate misconduct hearing over a further 11 disciplinary charges of gross misconduct over allegations he misused credit cards and other alleged corrupt practices. He will face a hearing for these allegations at a later date.</p> <p>The chief constable is one of at least eight very senior officers in England facing disciplinary hearings or investigations over alleged misconduct. They include the Sussex chief constable, Martin Richards, Stuart Hyde, the temporary chief constable of the Cumbria force, Price's deputy, Bonnard, and the chief constable of Northamptonshire, Adrian Lee.</p> <p>Price, Bonnard and Cleveland police's former solicitor Caroline Llewellyn were arrested in August last year as part of the ongoing criminal inquiry into misuse of public funds and corrupt practices, codenamed Operation Sacristy. Led by officers from Warwickshire and North Yorkshire police, the investigation is said to be a major and complex inquiry into corrupt practices, including in the awarding of business contracts by the police authority.</p> <p>McLuckie was arrested in November last year as part of the same investigation.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 October 2012. The original described Caroline Llewellyn as Cumbria police's former solicitor. She was a solicitor for Cleveland police.</p>",
