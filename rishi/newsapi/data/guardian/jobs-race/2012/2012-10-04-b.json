  "<p>It is perhaps an unlikely theme for a blockbuster film in a country with a dire air safety record: a near miss in which a pilot steers a smoke-filled plane to safety.</p> <p>In Nigeria, Last Flight to Abuja has become the first homegrown production to outsell Hollywood films this year. Crowds have been packing cinemas to see how the Nollywood fiction matches the reality of taking an internal flight in Africa's most populous country.</p> <p>The film took a record-breaking 8m naira (\u00a332,340) in its first week on release in Lagos. It has toppled this year's box office hits The Amazing Spider-Man and Ice Age: Continental Drift, and is currently the second highest grossing film in west Africa after The Dark Knight Rises.</p> <p>\"Each time I fly in Nigeria it's a nervy experience. All the shaking, the bumpy landings, the unexplained noises, as the plane starts off five hours after you're supposed to have arrived at your destination,\" said the director, Obi Emelonye. \"The film was an accumulation of all those stories.\"</p> <p>The timing of the film's release was inauspicious. It coincided with a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/03/nigeria-plane-crash?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Dana Air plane smashing into a Lagos slum</a>, killing 163 people. Relatives of the dead encouraged the director not to cancel, to keep aviation safety in the spotlight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396617771\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/9/24/1348507749545/A-poster-for-Last-Flight--001.jpg\" alt=\"A poster for Last Flight to Abuja, directed by Obi Emelonye\" width=\"200\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster for Last Flight to Abuja, the Nollywood film directed by Obi Emelonye, which reflects his concerns at the abysmal air safety record in Nigeria.

I felt I had a social responsibility to show [improvements] we could make with just a little change of attitude, being proactive,\" he said.</p> <p>Audiences have given the fictional white-knuckle ride a positive reception.</p> <p>\"When I watched it, I thought that's how a country with big dreams like Nigeria should be able to handle an aviation disaster,\" said cinemagoer Daye Sola, who has spurned domestic carriers since a \"bad experience\" 12 years ago.</p> <p>Not everybody is convinced by the fairytale ending, in which emergency workers are at the scene before the plane's dramatic touchdown.</p> <p>Femi Alade, whose house is within sight of where the Dana plane crashed, is a rare person from the slum who watched the film. \"Someone like me, I have never entered a plane and I will not do so. I enjoyed the film but afterwards I remembered how people were looting and police were beating the crowds,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The emergency reaction wasn't realistic, it was just too prompt,\" said another filmgoer, Ohimide, 32, after a showing in Lagos. The reality is undoubtedly grimmer. June's accident marked the start of a tumultuous period in which half of Nigeria's domestic airlines have been grounded.</p> <p>Africa accounts for 14% of the world's aeroplane crashes although it has only 3% of global traffic.</p> <p>Whistleblowers have claimed that heavy debts in the aviation sector routinely compromise safety.</p> <p>In some cases, insiders say planes have been dangerously overloaded with fuel to avoid paying refuelling fees in each country.</p> <p>David Kolawole's seven-month-old daughter survived the initial Dana Air impact. But emergency services took 45 minutes to push through the crowds thronging the slum's narrow mud roads. At the local hospital, staff were unable to save her amid electricity blackouts. \"In a country where people are prepared, she could have been saved,\" Kolawole said.</p> <p>An inquest revealed other failings, including emergency staff who had not been trained to put out an aircraft fire with chemical foam rather than water. The aviation minister, Stella Oduah, has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/09/nigerian-plane-crash-airline-licence?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">cleared Dana Air to fly again</a>, although an inquiry continues.</p> <p>Safety in Nigeria improved after two aircraft crashed within two months in 2005. But public distrust has returned since the country's most popular airline, Arik Air, was briefly grounded when aviation workers raided its offices, saying they had not been paid.</p> <p>Hailed for its fleet of new planes in a creaking industry, Arik had mopped up passengers in west Africa's thriving market as competitors floundered.</p> <p>Accusations of financial mismanagement have threatened to engulf the sector, which has grown steadily as air travel has become an alternative to being transported along the region's often poorly maintained roads.</p> <p>\"We had situations where some of our aircraft were flying with only one engine working rather than pay for the cost of maintaining two,\" said John Nnorom, a former finance director at Air Nigeria, one of the recently suspended airlines.</p>",
  "<p>When Jim Lehrer laid out the ground rules for last night's debate \u2013 six blocks of 15 minutes, two-minute chunks of response, no cheering \u2013 about the only thing that held true was his granting of a preliminary \"noise exception\" as the candidates were introduced. It may be best to view the entire evening through that lens: an hour-and-a-half exception, for the purposes of introduction, to the campaign cacophony we've been subjected to so far, the babble and squeak of commentary and complaints that has been in the background consistently, even <em>during</em> the debates of the Republican primary, when the press was silent but the clown-car of GOP candidates acting as their own peanut gallery.</p> <p>Last night, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama went head-to-head without the distraction of other candidates \u2013 and there was no simultaneous commentary, no applause, not even, really, a moderator. </p> <p>It was an arena with no weapons except one's wits; maybe we shouldn't be surprised that the president's seemed duller. He hasn't participated in a one-on-one contest (much less a football-team-sized scrum) in four years. The only debates he's gotten into with someone who's even close to his equal have been with Michelle and, let's face it, she probably lets him win.</p> <p>In 2008, when John McCain wanted to \"suspend\" the presidential campaigns in order to \"focus on the economy\", he suffered in part because of what it seemed to say about his ability to manage actually being president. Anyone capable of doing <em>that</em> surely shouldn't have to choose between campaigning and participating in a discussion about the economy \u2013 or, as the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_09/014867.php\">pundits put it</a> then, \"I think walking and chewing gum at the same time is part of the president's job.\"</p> <p>In Denver, Obama barely seemed able to stand still and stay awake. He didn't even lift a finger to save Big Bird.</p> <p>The debate highlighted almost all of Obama's worst qualities: he seemed bored to the point of condescension, particular to the point of testiness, and proved for the hundredth or so time that he is Worst. Socialist. Ever. \"We ought to bring the tax rates down,\" Obama agreed, \"Both for corporations and for individuals.\" And that was in addition to telling Lehrer that he and Romney had a \"somewhat similar position\" on social security! This last concession was especially wounding to progressives and undermined the argument Obama implied when he said, \"If you are 54 or 55, you might want to pay attention.\" Maybe he meant that line more literally, in which case I guess there's a reason he put the rest of us to sleep.</p> <p>Not that Romney was much better. Personally more amped, but substantively just as bland, the GOP nominee pulled off only one truly astonishing trick: maintaining the attitude of someone on the high wire while, in reality, creeping close to the ground. Compared to the bold (even foolhardy) choices he's made throughout his campaign in service of appealing to the Republicans' most staunch rightwingers, this iteration of Romney hewed close to the center even as his eyes glinted with radical zeal (or maybe too much sugar).</p> <p>His bullet-pointed answers were all form and no function \u2013 and continued to gloss over specifics with an airy attitude that last night implied confidence rather than confusion. Maybe staffers told him he wasn't going to have to be funny, after all.</p> <p>Granted a context-free performance, Romney unveiled the brand-new General Election Edition of himself: an energetic advocate of bipartisanship and measured regulation of the market. Positioning himself as a cheerful alternative to the distracted, skinny stiff to his left, Romney 4.0 (I think?) so wowed conservative partisans that they seemed to have forgotten the Romney on stage was not the one they'd nominated. Will their excitement over the renewed prospect of winning prevent a Tea Party revolt, or provoke disavowal of the scorched-earth ideological strategy that has led to the re-embrace of Todd Akin?</p> <p>It largely depends on who appears on the hustings today. How much does the mileage for the \"Romney hybrid\" depend on journalists eager for an exciting race clearing the road ahead of obstacles \u2013 such as consistency or detail? </p> <p>The Obama team, reportedly, expected to see pundits swoon over an even tolerable performance by Romney. Indeed, recent history suggests that a desire for a close contest can inflate poor performing candidates' grades \u2013 John Kerry \"won\" all four of his debates against George Bush. Those same Obama staffers were probably less prepared for the onslaught of positive reviews from the general public that came via insta-polls last night and this morning. These results give weight to the argument that Republicans have been making all along: Americans are tired of seeing the same bad news over and over, and the president's turn as the problem-solver has passed.</p> <p>At best, he can only offer stewardship; Romney gave a glimpse of what it might be like to have a bright and shiny new leader. In the marketplace of ideas, Romney presented a beautiful gift box. Unopened. Mint.</p>",
  "<p>Godspeed You! Black Emperor have returned with their first album in 10 years, springing it on the world at a gig in Boston on Monday. The first anyone outside Godspeed's camp knew of the record was when fans approached the merch table at the Orpheum theatre and saw vinyl copies of Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend! for sale.</p> <p>The band will be talking about their new album in an exclusive interview in next week's G2 Film &amp; music, and the Guardian will be streaming the album in full.</p> <p>It has been a little over two years since Godspeed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/apr/13/godspeed-you-black-emperor-atp\" title=\"\">returned to the spotlight</a>, reforming to curate the All Tomorrow's Parties festival. The hugely influential post-rock ensemble have toured persistently since then, criss-crossing the US, visiting Europe and even playing outdoor festivals like Coachella and Pitchfork. Despite these appearances, the reclusive musicians revealed almost nothing about recording; percussionist Bruce Cawdron was the only one to <a href=\"http://voir.ca/nouvelles/actualite-musicale/2011/05/27/godspeed-prepare-un-nouveau-disque/\" title=\"\">admit it was happening</a>, in May 2011.</p> <p>Then abruptly on Monday night, Allelujah! was out. Sort of. Although the record won't be properly released until 15 October, the band has started selling it at gigs. It is also available for pre-order \u2013 although Godspeed's longtime label, Constellation Records, <a href=\"http://cstrecords.com/gybe-lp-pre-orders-suspended-due-to-overwhelming-demand/\" title=\"\">has run out of vinyl</a>. \"We sincerely and strongly encourage you to support independent music retailers by buying the album when it is in stores or appears on other mail-order sites,\" they said.</p> <p>On vinyl, the album consists of just two songs, each more than 20 minutes long. Both are old compositions, recorded recently in Montreal. An accompanying 7in includes two drone tracks. Although the album artwork could have been part of a Godspeed release circa 2000, full of urban decay and melted celluloid, the songs include references to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/02/quebec-student-protest-canada\" title=\"\">Montreal's recent protests</a>, the so-called Maple spring. One song is titled Strung Like Lights at Thee Printemps \u00c9rable, and another incorporates a recording of the clanging pots and pans of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/26/montreal-casseroles-student-protests\" title=\"\">summer \"casserole\"</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Doing anything ridiculous this weekend? I am. As part of the <a href=\"http://londongamesfestival.com/\">London Games Festival</a>, I'll be participating in a 48-hour game jam, in which journalists will be writing the games, with the help of student programmers, while a selection of established indie developers will act as journalists, writing previews and interviews as the madness progresses. </p> <p>\"The idea came to me when I was writing a blog to deadline for Develop at this year's GDC,\" says organiser and veteran developer, Will Luton. \"I thought 'we always bitch on journalists but these guys have a tough job'. It was a small leap to swap the roles in a Game Hack \u2013 I put it to Twitter, the response was insane and Ukie and Develop pitched in to make it happen.\"</p> <p>I'll be competing against three other games writers: Rob Crossley from CVG, Lewie Procter from Savy Gamer and Dan Griliopoulos from Rock Paper Shotgun. The developers writing it all up are Andrew Smith from Spilt Milk Studios, Mike Bithell, creator of Thomas Was Alone, Peter Theophilus-Bevis from Blitz Studios and Jim Griffiths from Mediatonic.</p> <p>The action will kick off at 5pm on Friday when the organisers will reveal the theme of the jam. We'll then be 'coding' (as I believe they say) until 5pm on Sunday. Gulp.</p> <p>I'll be live-blogging the event on Gamesblog \u2013 for just as long as I am able to construct coherent sentences. You'll also be able to follow the #journodevswap hash tag on Twitter.</p>"
