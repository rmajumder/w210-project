  "<p>Football administrators, supporters and players have no room for complacency regarding discrimination, racism included. That is the conclusion of a parliamentary committee which has urged the Football Association to demonstrate strong, example-setting leadership.</p> <p>Among its key recommendations are measures to increase the number of black managers, directors and referees. Although these stop short of advocating positive discrimination, there is a suspicion that certain recruitment processes are not entirely meritocratic and may instead favour white candidates.</p> <p>The committee also stops short of suggesting that new legislation is needed, pointing out that: \"There is already legislation in the UK concerning racist or indecent behaviour at football matches. The Football Offences Act 1991 made racist or indecent chanting an offence at a designated football match.\"</p> <p>Instead it says: \"We recommend that the Football Association commission an external body to conduct a review of the educational programmes about discrimination currently available and make recommendations based on their effectiveness.\" It adds: \"The FA should demand stronger leadership from Uefa and Fifa on tackling racism.\"</p> <p>The Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee conducted its inquiry in the wake of some high-profile cases of alleged racist abuse last season and concluded that consistent methods for reporting criminal behaviour, most notably racism, are still lacking, particularly at grass-roots level.</p> <p>Another concern, which it believes needs addressing, is homophobic abuse. This was described as a \"significant problem\", sometimes concealed by the euphemistic term \"laddish behaviour\". The use of social media by, among others, the FA, as a deterrent to this and other types of discrimination was advocated.</p> <p>Committee members also identified a clear need to encourage more candidates from ethnic minorities to train as coaches and referees, thereby ensuring that clubs can recruit from a more diverse talent pool. They stressed that all appointments should be based on merit, irrespective of race, and concluded that the most equitable way to introduce greater diversity among managers and club boards was to encourage a transparency and consistency of recruitment across the game.</p> <p>While noting radical changes in atmosphere and attitudes at matches since the 1970s and 1980s when racist abuse proved common and football was often far from family friendly, the committee stressed that room for improvement remained.</p> <p>It hopes the FA will prioritise the development of procedures and training which would enable stewards and other club staff to react swiftly and consistently to abusive incidents.</p> <p>While prosecutions in cases of racial abuse at league and club level are \"extremely welcome\", similar efforts should be applied to the grass-roots game, the committee said.</p> <p>John Whittingdale MP, chair of the committee, said: \"Much has been done to improve the atmosphere and behaviour at football matches. However, significant problems remain.</p> <p>\"Social media has become a tool for the spread of racist and abusive content but it is also a potential means of combating the ignorance and prejudice that lie behind such behaviour.</p> <p>\"The football authorities should be using this developing communication forum to spread positive messages about equality and diversity and to speak out strongly against racist abuse. More needs to be done to increase the diversity of coaches and referees, to embed the values of equality and diversity at all levels.</p> <p>\"While the general level of progress in combating racism and racist abuse in the UK should be applauded, there is much more that can and must be done. We believe it is for the FA to take the lead and set the example for everyone to follow.\"</p>",
  "<p>What defines a woman? Over the past few weeks the defining feature has been the new celebrity in town, a source of fascination to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-19319240\" title=\"\">deluded politicians</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/02/naomi-wolf-women-orgasm-neural-wiring\" title=\"\"><em>soi-disant</em> feminists</a> alike: the vagina, a magical creature that can distinguish between consensual sex and rape and, according to Naomi Wolf's now <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2012/09/10/120910crbo_books_levy\" title=\"\">much-</a><a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/sep/27/pride-and-prejudice/?pagination=false book\" title=\"\">mocked</a> <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/laurie-penny/2012/09/problem-naomi-wolfs-vagina\" title=\"\">book</a>, can hear when it is being insulted and will rebel in kind, turning the carrier person into \"a bitch\". This is the problem with essentialism: no matter how varied its uses, the ultimate point is always the same and always reductive.</p> <p>But femaleness doesn't stop at the vagina. No, no, no! Many things happen via the magical vagina and it is one of these in particular that certain US politicians see as defining a woman. No, not cystitis, or vajazzling, although I'd love to hear Mitt Romney's thoughts on those pressing issues. No, it is motherhood.</p> <p>This was most obvious at the Republican and Democrat national conventions, in which the current and aspiring first ladies did the traditional schtick of attempting to appeal to women voters by telling Americans what great husbands they have. Whether being even a halfway decent president is in any way connected with being a great husband is a question I reckon Hillary Clinton and the late Jackie Kennedy Onassis could answer with more authority than me but that was not the point these women were hammering home. Rather, it was their role as mothers.</p> <p>Ann Romney announced at the beginning of her <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NraMG2zImE\" title=\"\">sappy speech</a> that she would be talking \"not about politics, not about party\" \u2013 which raised the question why she was talking at the RNC at all \u2013 \"but love \u2026 that love so deep only a mother can fathom it\". It is mothers, according to Romney, \"who really hold this country together\" and while she was open-minded enough to include \"single, married, widowed\" in the varieties, the ultimate flavour was still the same: Mom. \"It's the moms who always have to work a little harder to make it right.\"</p> <p>Michelle Obama also played the mom card in her otherwise <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTPdKUA9Ipg\" title=\"\">perfectly judged speech</a>, saying \"at the end of the day, my most important role is still 'mom-in-chief'\". Writer Tami Winfrey Harris <a href=\"http://www.clutchmagonline.com/2012/09/a-black-mom-in-chief-is-revolutionary-what-white-feminist-get-wrong-about-michelle-obama/\" title=\"\">wrote</a> recently in response to the disapproval Obama received for this, saying that critics are missing the point here: Obama is overturning old stereotypes about black women by presenting herself as \"nurturing, beautiful and stylish as well as whip smart, athletic and strong\". But in this instance, the line between \"overturning racial stereotypes\" and \"kowtowing to a gender status quo\" seems an awfully fine one.</p> <p>The Republicans have a problem with women, on various levels. They have a problem with getting women votes; Obama currently has a <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/14/poll-obama-holds-narrow-edge-over-romney/\" title=\"\">12-point advantage</a> over Romney among women and <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-11/obama-tops-romney-in-poll-with-2-1-backing-from-single-women.html\" title=\"\">a poll</a> in July said twice as many single women favour Obama over Romney. The Democrats, encouraged by this and by the Republican's move to the intractable right in regards to birth control, have been <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/09/05/dems_to_ladies_you_are_important/\" title=\"\">talking </a>about abortion and contraception with increasing boldness.</p> <p>The Republicans, by contrast, have become hysterically conservative and retrograde about birth control and abortion. Simultaneously, they venerate the concept of motherhood yet don't want to deal with the messy realities of it, which is why they can <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/09/07/1129098/-Mitt-Romney-s-women-s-ambassador-says-birth-control-is-off-message\" title=\"\">claim</a> that birth control is not an economic issue when it clearly is precisely that.</p> <p>Paul Ryan can <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/18/paul-ryan-mother-medicare-florida\" title=\"\">wax sentimental</a> about his dear mother while simultaneously proposing <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/13/how-would-a-vice-president-paul-ryan-affect-women.html\" title=\"\">cuts</a> to women's healthcare, <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3717\" title=\"\">cuts</a> to what was once known as the food stamp programme by $133.5bn (\u00a382bn) and removing exemptions in abortions, even for rape and incest victims. This is because the mothers they want to think about are rich mothers. (They also like thin ones: when Romney was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/post/romney-hearts-snooki-among-other-interview-highlights/2012/09/14/ed11e80c-fe8e-11e1-8adc-499661afe377_blog.html\" title=\"\">asked</a> recently who his favourite reality TV star was he replied that it is Snooki from Jersey Shore, who recently had a baby: \"Look how thin she's gotten! She's lost weight,\" he replied, like a magazine that applauds women who lose the \"baby weight\".) Thus, when Ann Romney was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/ann-romney-responds-to-democratic-pundit-saying-she-never-worked-a-day-in-her-life/2012/04/12/gIQApstpBT_blog.html\" title=\"\">accused</a> back in April of not being representative of most American women due to her $250m bank account, the Romney campaign insisted that her status as a mother somehow outweighed her financial situation, meaning she really is an everywoman, such is the mythical power of motherhood.</p> <p>Now, I'd like to state for the record that I love mothers. Hell, I even have one myself. But it should surely go without saying that, just as not all parents are women, not all women are mothers. This somewhat undermines the idea that emphasising Obama and Romney's maternal roles makes them \u2013 and by extension, their husbands \u2013 universally relatable. A woman's role as a mother is of undoubtedly central importance within her home but, at the risk of undermining this Norman Rockwell mentality in US politics, it's not really all that relevant to those outside it.</p> <p>Moreover, this conflation of women and mothers and valuing motherhood itself over women plays into the mentality of anti-choice advocates who believe that the woman herself doesn't matter: it's the baby who is important here, who defines her \u2013 she's just the carrier pod. Contrary to what too many politicians think, not all mothers are the same and not all women are mothers. Just as the vagina doth not make the woman, nor does the uterus.</p>",
  "<p>In 1901, the total population of the Bangladeshi areas of British India was less than 2%. Now, more than a century later, urban planners are predicting the country's future will be one of sprawling, interconnected metropolises with a largely urban population moving between hundreds of cities and large towns.</p> <p>Last year, the national census showed that out of a population of more than 150 million, just under 30% live in the rapidly expanding cities and towns, with the urban population increasing about 6% a year as millions of people leave rural areas in search of work.</p> <p>Dhaka absorbs many of those on the move. Its sprawling slums are testament to the capital's struggle to accommodate the millions of new residents. Land is so scarce that people have filled in rivers around the city to make space for new housing. Mass evictions are on the rise as landowners clear out slums to make way for more profitable building projects. New residents are increasingly pushed out to the city's fringes.</p> <p>The government's refusal to acknowledge either the slums or the fact that 40% of Dhaka residents are now slum dwellers means that public service budgets \u2013 and basic facilities like water and electricity \u2013 are not being extended to accommodate the millions of new residents.</p> <p>While many rural districts now have an accessible community outreach healthcare system in place, in Dhaka the vast majority of healthcare services are still based in hospitals.</p> <p>According to healthcare workers, hospitals are already unable to meet the growing demand for treatment and services. Dhaka's largest hospital is operating at 50% staff capacity and trying to accommodate 3,000 patients in a facility with just 800 beds.</p> <p>Many rural migrants, fearful of hidden costs, are reluctant to access hospital or clinic-based services at all. And since no healthcare facilities are provided in the slums, Dhaka's newest \u2013 and poorest \u2013 residents are facing a healthcare black hole.</p> <p>Those who most often fall through the cracks are women. While urbanisation presents significant advantages for rural women and girls, not least the opportunity to join the burgeoning female workforce in garment factories and middle-class households, women in the slums are left without any kind of antenatal or child healthcare services.</p> <p>After Bangladesh's impressive strides in improving maternal and child healthcare nationwide, the Manoshi project is one of the initiatives that aims to bridge this gap and prevent urbanisation creating a freefall in maternal and infant mortality levels.</p> <p>The project, run by Bangladeshi NGO <a href=\"http://www.brac.net/\" title=\"\">Brac</a>, was launched in 2007 and is currently helping 3 million female slum dwellers access maternal and newborn healthcare services.</p> <p>A network of 6,000 volunteer healthcare workers \u2013 each responsible for 200 households \u2013 offers women care from family planning through to antenatal services. These services include awareness programmes for family members, labour preparation programmes and regular medical checks. But only 34 volunteers work in Korail, one of Dhaka's largest slums.</p> <p>In Bangladesh, 78% of births still occur at home. The Korail programme has installed a labour room in its central office to replicate the home-birth environment, but with trained midwives and traditional birth attendants on hand to ensure births are as risk-free as possible. An emergency referral system enables women who need to be transferred to hospital to be taken there as quickly as possible, with transport provided.</p> <p>\"There's no point demanding these women give birth in hospital, because they are reluctant to do so and, even if we put pressure on them to go, when they arrive they will probably find there is no room for them,\" says Dr Rashed Choudhury, manager of the Brac health programme. \"We're prioritising creating a safe and familiar environment for them to get the best care possible.\"</p> <p>The project has almost halved the number of maternal deaths among its patients, from 294 for every 100,000 live births in 2007 to 135 now \u2013 a figure below the national average of 194 per 100,000.</p> <p>The next challenge is to meet increasing demand and keep track of women as they move from slum to slum. Korail was the site of a controversial eviction this year; similar episodes are not unlikely.</p> <p>Brac healthworkers say maternal health in Dhaka is beginning to reflect the challenges of urbanisation. \"Mothers are facing more new dangers than they did in the rural areas,\" says Choudhury. \"We're seeing a lot of jaundice from polluted water sources, infants severely affected by poor sanitation, and mothers severely undernourished. We will have to adapt to all these things if we're going to respond to the needs of millions of people in Dhaka in the coming years.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <em>This article was amended on 19 September 2012. The original article said the urban population of Bangladesh was 2%, there were 6,000 volunteers in Korail, the maternal mortality rate was 297 per 100,000 live births and there were 4.1 million slum dwellers</em></p>"
