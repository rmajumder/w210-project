  "<p>Sir Henry Cecil is to return to the racecourse for the first time in months in order to see Frankel make his much-anticipated move up in distance in York's Juddmonte International Stakes on Wednesday. The world's champion racehorse will tackle eight rivals as he races over a mile and a quarter for the first time. Cecil, his trainer, was absent for Frankel's most recent victory in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood, but said: \"I just cannot miss the day and I want to be there for Frankel.</p> <p>\"Although I have had some medical treatment recently and not been racing because my immune system is low, I have been able to work from home. I am very hopeful that I will be able to make it to York on Wednesday.\"</p> <p>Cecil has been receiving treatment for stomach cancer for six years and a recent bout of chemotherapy reportedly took its toll on the 69-year-old. He has not been seen on a racecourse since Royal Ascot in mid-June.</p> <p>Two of the world's most powerful racing and bloodstock operations will be represented by teams of three runners and speculation as to how tactics will play out in the race is sure to be a popular topic of debate in the build-up.</p> <p>Frankel's regular pacemaker, Bullet Train, and their stablemate Twice Over will both join him in the line-up, while Aidan O'Brien has declared Windsor Castle and Robin Hood alongside Ballydoyle's big hope, St Nicholas Abbey.</p> <p>Instances in which pacemakers are ridden in a transparently kamikaze manner are thankfully rare. Bullet Train has led Frankel to the two-furlong pole in all three of his starts this season but even in defeat has achieved some of the best performances of his career. Windsor Palace, meanwhile, was good enough to win a Group Three at The Curragh when setting the pace for St Nicholas Abbey, who was given too much ground to make up.</p> <p>The clear potential for team tactics in this race has in the past led officials at the British Horseracing Authority to brief riders of their reponsibilities, though in this case there will be no such direct intervention. \"The rules on assisting another horse in a race are very clear and the jockeys involved are all very experienced and should know them well,\" said the BHA's spokesman, Robin Mounsey.</p> <p>\"It's worth emphasising that pure pacemaking is not prohibited. It's normally pretty clear when a horse will be acting as a pacemaker and, as long as the rules on team tactics are observed, then we don't have a problem with it.\"</p> <p>A dry day on the Knavesmire saw conditions remain unchanged at good to firm but an uncertain weather forecast has led course officials to consider the possibility of further watering later in the week, having already added 3mm of artificial irrigation to the track on Monday evening.</p> <p>That was not welcome news for the trainer Roger Charlton, who will try to win Friday's Nunthorpe with Bated Breath. He took to Twitter on Monday morning to issue a frustrated plea against any further watering, but later said he understood the difficult position that those at the track were in.</p> <p>\"I think they feel that the ground is as fast now as it has been and they understandably put some water on last night,\" he said. \"It has been very frustrating for everybody, racecourses included. The weather conditions have been really strange. There is no doubt that when racecourses are being forced to run a lot of horses when the ground is soft and heavy, it does damage the ground to a certain extent and, dare I say, leaves the potential for the ground to be rough.</p> <p>\"They [racecourses] are not in an easy situation. They didn't have it on their radar that it was likely to rain on Wednesday, but every forecast is different.</p> <p>\"Bated Breath doesn't deserve faster ground any more than anyone else but to be seen at his best he does need it.\"</p> <p>Motivado, the long-term favourite for Saturday's Ebor Handicap, appears likely to get a run in the race. After the latest declaration stage he needs only two runners to come out of the contest before Friday morning. He is now no bigger than 9-2.</p>",
  "<p>On Friday and Monday we publish the problems that will feature in a forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/series/dearjeremy\" title=\"Dear Jeremy series page\">Dear Jeremy</a> advice column in the Guardian Money supplement so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy's own insights. Here is the latest dilemma \u2013 what are your thoughts?</p> <p><strong>I have always been interested in politics and the third sector, but as I graduated with a middling English degree during the recession, I decided to take the safest course and apply to graduate schemes. I am currently working for a big organisation on a very good salary. I have a large peer group, job security and a lot of training and development. Some rotations are more interesting than others, but it's not an environment in which I ultimately want to work, and I am not happy working here.</strong></p> <p><strong>How can I make the move to a job in the political sphere that I would enjoy more, and when would the timing be right for me to do so? I have been in my current job for just over a year and the graduate programme is two years long. Would leaving early have any negative repercussions on my CV later on?</strong></p> <p><strong>I hoped the business experience I am gaining now would stand me in good stead, but the long hours mean I have no time for any extracurricular volunteering, so I am missing out on that side of things. I'm worried I am not qualified in the right ways for a job in politics. Would going back to university to do a masters in politics help, or just be an additional expense?</strong></p> <p>\u2022 For Jeremy's and readers' advice on a work issue, send a brief email to <a href=\"mailto:dear.jeremy@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"dear.jeremy@guardian.co.uk\">dear.jeremy@guardian.co.uk</a>.
