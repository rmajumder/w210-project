  "<p>More a literary gumshoe detective than a conventional biographer, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/bios/tom_reiss/search?contributorName=Tom+Reiss\" title=\"\">Tom Reiss </a>has written the last of a trilogy of enthralling biographies. His first book was <em>F\u00fchrer Ex</em>, co-written with a young East German, Ingo Hesselbach, who was involved in the neo-Nazi \"scene\" before repenting and shopping his erstwhile comrades. As a Jewish outsider, Reiss was well-placed to tell this story, as he was for his next book <em>The Orientalist</em>, the fascinating<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Nussimbaum\" title=\"\"> tale of Lev Nussimbaum</a>, aka Kurban Said, a Jewish Azeri writer and wheeler-dealer who assumed the identity of a Muslim in Hitler's reich and Mussolini's Italy.</p> <p>Now he tells a long-hidden story that sheds light on racism and the damage it does. And, although this time his research was conducted chiefly in rural France, it had its share of thrills. Reiss persuaded a French small-town official to blow open a municipal library's safe when the librarian \u2013 the only person knowing the combination \u2013 suddenly died.</p> <p><em>The Black Count</em> is a study of a hitherto obscure historical figure, General Alexandre (Alex) Dumas \u2013 not the famous Alexandre Dumas p\u00e8re, author of <em>The Three Musketeers</em> and <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em>, nor the novelist's playwright son, who wrote<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lady_of_the_Camellias\" title=\"\"> the classic <em>La dame aux cam\u00e9lias</em></a>. Reiss's subject is the first Alexandre Dumas, who proves to have had a stranger life than many portrayed in his son's and grandson's fictions.</p> <p>Dumas was born in 1762 in the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue (modern Haiti). It was not an auspicious start. Dumas was a \"<em>batarde</em>\" - the product of a relationship between his aristocratic French father, Marquis Alexandre Davy de la Pailleterie, and a freed slave, Marie-Cesette Dumas. (Her surname, meaning \"of the farm\", was bestowed on her because managing a sugar plantation was her occupation as a freewoman.) Reiss is excellent on the colonial attitudes to race exemplified by Alex's father, who, after Marie-Cesette died when the boy was 12, though proud of his strapping son, sold him into slavery to pay for his passage back to Normandy. After six months of Alex's servitude, the marquis purchased his freedom and duly shipped him to France, to commence an education befitting a gentleman.</p> <p>Alex proved adept at the skills expected of a young French aristocrat: especially fencing and horsemanship. His father remarried, however, and, possibly ashamed of his mulatto son, cut Alex off without a centime. Undaunted, the young man joined the army. During the French revolution he fought alongside other black men in a unit called the African Legion.</p> <p>Dumas's military abilities were quickly recognised and he rose through the ranks from corporal to general in a little over two years, commanding a division of 53,000 soldiers when he was just 30. He fought in the many wars waged against revolutionary France and captured a key fortress in the Alps from the Austrians, who dubbed him <em>Der schwarze Teufel</em> (the \"Black Devil\") after he scaled an ice-covered rock wall in boots he had fitted with crampons. He was also noted for showing unusual moderation in the savage civil war against Catholic royalists in the Vend\u00e9e. By the time Napoleon Bonaparte had emerged as the strong man from the chaos of revolution, Dumas was a dangerous rival.</p> <p>Napoleon took Dumas on his disastrous Egyptian campaign as his cavalry commander, where the two generals fell out and Dumas quit his command. When he was shipwrecked off Italy en route home from Egypt, he was imprisoned by the Bourbon king, Ferdinand I of Naples and Sicily. Reiss suggests that it was deliberate foot-dragging by a spiteful and jealous Napoleon that delayed his rival's release. Ferdinand attempted to&#xa0;poison&#xa0;Dumas with arsenic and by the time he was finally freed, the man who could reputedly lift his own horse off the ground was a half-blind, half-deaf wreck. Dumas went back to the small town of Villers-Cotter\u00eats where he had met his devoted wife Marie-Louise, and fathered the future&#xa0;novelist.</p> <p>The France to which Dumas returned was utterly changed. Napoleon's military autocracy had extinguished the last sparks of revolutionary zeal. In the most poignant change of all Napoleon reintroduced slavery in Dumas's native&#xa0;Haiti, and crushed the republic of former slaves established by the Haitian hero <a href=\"http://www.historywiz.com/toussaint.htm\" title=\"\">Toussaint L'Ouverture</a>. This even though Napoleon's first wife,&#xa0;Jos\u00e9phine, was a West Indian Creole, from Martinique. (Earlier, Dumas had refused to command the expedition France sent against L'Ouverture, who ended his days in a&#xa0;Napoleonic jail.)</p> <p>The story of Dumas's imprisonment&#xa0;and death in 1806 from stomach&#xa0;cancer exacerbated by arsenic&#xa0;(the same disease that would kill Napoleon) was told in <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em>. Reiss has written a swashbuckling tale of his own.</p> <p>Nigel Jones's <em>Tower: An Epic History of the Tower&#xa0;of&#xa0;London</em> is published by Hutchinson.</p>",
  "<p>Hippy redoubt, artsy hub, unofficial lesbian capital of Britain, ecotown, hill walker's paradise \u2026 is there a more Guardian-friendly destination than Hebden Bridge?</p> <p>The \"new\" White Lion offers another persuasive reason to visit. This old boozer is now a polished country inn, all log fires, smart designer fabrics and references, in wood panelling and exposed stone, to this Grade II-listed building's 17th-century vintage. In a West Yorkshire town that, unusually, lacks great pubs (the outlying <a href=\"http://www.stubbingwharf.com/\" title=\"\">Stubbing Wharf</a> is one real ale beacon), Michael Grimes and Rebekah Grayson's revival of the Lion is clearly welcome. On a rain-lashed Tuesday night, it is packed, the convivial hubbub merging with a discrete background soundtrack of Sinatra and Fitzgerald. Thanks to candles and sensitively distributed lights the whole place is suffused in an amber glow as warm and enticing as a glass of good single malt.</p> <p>Upstairs, four \"boutique\" rooms (\u00a3125) are finished to a similarly high spec, with rain showers and roll-top baths in chic slate bathrooms. If they lack vivid personality, the building, with its sloping floors and cobbled courtyard overlooking the Hebden river (and, erm, the back of Boots), adds quirky character. There is also a beauty room where Grayson offers treatments, which I didn't try. My face is beyond repair.</p> <p>Be warned, however, that not all the rooms have been renovated to this standard. The four cottages (\u00a395, dogs welcome) have had a \"cosmetic\" face-lift, ahead of full renovation in November.</p> <p>I ended up, as the pub was fully booked, in room five (two doubles in separate rooms), which is a half-finished hotchpotch \u2013 its trendy striped carpet at odds with the scruffy old bathroom suite. At \u00a3125, for four adults, the room is fair value (breakfast, where high-quality local ingredients shine, is included in the room rate), but at \u00a3105 for one couple it's not. Either way, until its January refurb, that room will lag behind. Certain details could be tweaked, too. The underpowered shower takes more than 90 seconds to come warm (a higher pressure boiler is being installed); the toiletries look a bit naff, and why, when you have a good kitchen, spoil a good tea tray (Yorkshire Gold, Taylors tea, ground coffee) with bought-in biscuits?</p> <p>In that kitchen, chef Simon Marshall has devised a broadly sensible menu of affordable pub dishes with, this being Hebden Bridge, plenty of vegetarian options. There is the occasional unnerving creative flourish (a lasagne of hot-smoked salmon, spinach and mozzarella, topped with garlic bread, is, if not unpleasant, strange), but a bowl, or rather a bucket \u2013 \"We're known for our portions,\" laughs Grayson \u2013 of rich beef stew topped with a perfect suet dumpling (\u00a310.95) is very tasty. Crisp, spicily bitter, Slightly Foxed, one of five well-kept ales (\u00a33.30), is a good foil.</p> <p><em>\u2022 For information on Yorkshire, visit </em><a href=\"http://www.yorkshire.com\" title=\"\"><em>yorkshire.com</em></a><em>.

  "<p>Spain's banks must fill a \u20ac59bn (\u00a347bn) hole in their capital cushions caused by a burst of reckless lending to building developers during the country's boom years that has left them awash with toxic real estate assets.</p> <p>The Spanish government and central bank on Friday revealed the results of an independent report commissioned to work out just how bad the damage is and to identify those banks that will need to be bailed out with eurozone rescue funds.</p> <p>The report, based on stress tests carried out by consultancy Oliver Wyman, lists seven banks that will certainly need bailout money or must raise further capital themselves by the middle of next year.</p> <p>Spain's secretary of state for the economy, Fernando Jim\u00e9nez Latorre, estimated that, over all, Spain's banks would eventually need some \u20ac40bn of the \u20ac100bn of bailout money on offer to them to cover the bad loans \u2013 adding that this marked the beginning of the end of the country's banking crisis.</p> <p>\"With this process capitalisation and restructuring needs will all be met,\" he said. \"All doubts should be dispelled.\"</p> <p>But markets remained nervous yesterday amid rumours that Spain's debt rating could be downgraded to junk status after the market closed. France's stock market index fell 1.5% while the German stock market was off 0.7% while US was 0.8% lower. Stocks in London edged 0.3% lower.</p> <p>Bankia, Spains's fourth-largest lender, topped the list with a hole in its capital needs estimated at \u20ac24.7bn. Catalunyabank will need another \u20ac10.8bn. In all cases, the hole represented the amount of extra capital the bank would need to survive a significant further turndown in Spain's recession-plagued economy.</p> <p>Bankia, created by the merger of half a dozen ailing savings banks, is one of several that also sold their own clients complex hybrid preference shares which will now see hundreds of thousands of ordinary Spanish retail investors forced to lose money.</p> <p>Eurozone authorities have made it clear they will not fill the entire \u20ac59bn hole with bailout money, and that part of it must be covered by inflicting losses on the preference shareholders.</p> <p>That will enrage the small investors, many of whom complain they were sold the shares without understanding what they were by insistent bank managers who cold-called them and claimed that they were as secure as ordinary deposits.</p> <p>Some put their life's savings into preference shares \u2013 and courts are dealing with thousands of cases where banks are accused of conning them into buying the shares. Central bank deputy governor Fernando Restoy said the losses for shareholders would be decided bank by bank.</p> <p>On Friday an investigating magistrate in Madrid, Javier G\u00f3mez Berm\u00fadez, ordered Spain's central bank to hand over information on the behaviour of senior executives of another collapsed savings bank \u2013 the Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM), which has since been cleaned up and sold on.</p> <p>Judge Bermudez wants the bank to say whether senior managers were honest about the amount of toxic real estate they had taken on as well as information on the way their pay was set. He also wants to know whether auditors should have spotted the problems before the bank collapsed.</p> <p>The Oliver Wyman report cleared most of the country's biggest banks, saying that Santander, BBVA, Caixabank, Sabadell and three others would not need any help.</p> <p>The figure of \u20ac59bn sets the upper limit of the amount of money the banks would need from the rescue fund. Two mergers between the banks affected should lower that to \u20ac54bn, with \u20ac44bn corresponding to banks that have already been nationalised.</p> <p>As part of the bailout terms those banks that receive bailout money will offload their toxic real estate onto a so-called \"bad bank\" which will pay prices well below the value reflected in banks' accounts.</p> <p>The \"bad bank\" will sell them off when the real estate market recovers. It has been given up to fifteen years to do that.</p> <p>With its banks now firmly set on the path to recapitalisation, Spain's government is widely expected to ask for a euro zone bailout for itself.</p> <p>Rating agency Moody's was expected to issue an evaluation of Spain's creditworthiness shortly, with concerns that the agency will downgrade Spain's government debt to junk status.</p> <p>Craig Erlam, markets analyst at Alpari, warned that this could \"create some panic\" among holders of Spanish debt. \"The positive side to this is this could accelerate the bailout request,\" he said.</p>",

  "<p>I've recently been offered the first full-time permanent position of my science career. It only took 11 years. This is my story but it could belong to many others.</p> <p>After completing my PhD in 2001 I worked as a post-doc researcher in biological sciences in two different labs until 2006. Despite best efforts, the second post-doc didn't work out research wise and after two years of negative results my funding ran out. Even though I applied for other positions, by the time my contract ended I was officially unemployed. To save money I decided to move back in with my parents and claim jobseekers allowance, a galling process when you are 33 and have three higher degrees.</p> <p>The job centre staff were nice. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/03/academic-job-seeking-and-post-doc-unemployment\" title=\"\">Contrary to some experiences</a>, they understood my qualifications, that I was trying hard to find another job and that they couldn't really help me. My jobseeker priorities were simple: monitor university and science websites for vacacnies. I registered with some science-focused recruitment agencies but any positions that came up were out of my area \u2013 subject-wise or geographic \u2013 and poorly paid.</p> <p>The department for work and pensions have a professional register for specialist careers, but the only job it found in six months that even vaguely matched my qualifications was lab technician in a secondary school. The chances of getting it were slim (they knew I would up sticks and leave for a post-doc as soon as I could) so I declined an interview to many frowns from my advisor, who understood but clearly didn't approve.</p> <p>In the meantime I applied for posts. Every day. Sometimes between six to 10 in an afternoon. I was willing to move anywhere and tailored my CV and application for every position I found. Despite some good publications on my CV and a lot of science experience, I couldn't get an interview. Eventually I took on some bar work, permissable part-time while claiming jobseekers allowance. What they don't tell you is that any wages for up to 16 hours work are taken out of your dole. I might as well have sat at home and watched Bargain Hunt. I was out of work, out of money and quickly running out of hope.</p> <p>But after four months things picked up. I got two interviews in as many days, one with a company in Cambridge and another in Aberdeen. Desperate for any job by then, I travelled hundreds of miles for the appointments and got to the last two for the Cambridge job, only losing out to a more experienced research candidate from UCL. That's the thing about negative results \u2013 you can't publish them. I was offered the position in Aberdeen but they wanted to job-share the post between two people, a fact they conveniently forgot to mention during the interview and that made relocation to Scotland financially impossible.</p> <p>The job centre did pay for my interview expenses, however, and my outlook improved \u2013 maybe I wasn't so rubbish after all. I soon got another interview for a one year post at Manchester University \u2013 some long awaited breathing space \u2013 and when I was given the position it was renewed for three years. I've since switched to another university and after two and a half years there and 11 years in total as a post-doc, I've been offered that permanent full-time post.</p> <p>Finally, I can forget about that sinking feeling that comes with knowing your contract is up. Is there funding? Will my grant application go through? Will I have to apply for another job? For the first time, I can look ahead and plan for my future. I can buy a house and build some foundations in a city without worrying if I have to move on in three years.</p> <p>What people sometimes don't realise is that a career in science is about sacrifice. You are overqualified and underpaid. You work late evenings and weekends when the experiments demand it. You're never permanently employed. No grant then no job. No HEFCE funding then no job. No exciting results then \u2013 guess what? \u2013 no job.</p> <p>You have to be a dynamic researcher with contacts and grants and results and publications. And you have to do it quickly. The gun sounds as soon as they shake your hand after the viva \u2013 and you're off. You have five to 10 years to get your own funding. Otherwise you become too expensive \u2013 I have twice taken a pay-cut to get a contract. After eight to 10 years you don't even qualify for research council starter fellowships.</p> <p>I know of many friends who have given up on a science career after completing their PhDs. No wonder, when it can take up to 15 years to get a lectureship. My own situation has improved. Both my university and line manager have been very supportive and allowed me to start a PGCHEP (Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education Practice) to improve my teaching abilities. But I am one of the lucky ones to get a permanent position.</p> <p>Anyone entering the research field should be under no illusion that it takes blood, sweat and tears to get anywhere unless you hit a magical bullseye: that truly novel find and that first Nature/Science paper from your first research project. To those lucky few, fellowships and PI grants and lectureships follow. The rest of us simply help them along the way, the faceless science post-docs trying to grind out a career and hit lucky on a project, idea or grant application before we become either too expensive or unemployed.</p> <p><em>Anonymous is a postdoctoral research associate in biological sciences at a UK university</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

He faces a disappointed liberal base, a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/27/us-gdp-growth-estimate-revised-down\">stuttering</a> economic recovery, stubborn joblessness, a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/15/lehman-brothers-collapse_n_1885489.html\">failure</a> to reform Wall Street and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/01/world/obamas-counterterrorism-aide-defends-drone-strikes.html\">defending</a> a drones and targeted killing programme that makes Dick Cheney look like Mahatma Gandhi. It helps the Democrat cause considerably, therefore, when Mitt Romney \u2013 far from attacking Obama \u2013 decides to self-destruct instead.</p> <p>So it was with the now-notorious \"47%\" <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser\">secret videotape</a> that emerged from inside a private Romney fundraiser. After all, why should the Obama team write their own attack ads when the Romney team give them the best lines free of charge?</p> <h2>What</h2> <p>Called \"My Job\", this 30-second TV spot is the third Obama ad to feature the secret video in which Romney lambasted almost half of all Americans as loafing, government-dependent \"victims\" to an audience of rich contributors.</p> <h2>When</h2> <p>It came out Thursday morning, 27 September.</p> <h2>Where</h2> <p>It will be airing in New Hampshire, Virginia, Florida, Ohio, Iowa, Nevada and Colorado. Which is a typical list of the battleground states.</p> <h2>How</h2> <p>You know you have made a big mistake when your opponent does not have to attack your words, or splice them out of context, or extract a single sentence as damning while ignoring everything else. Instead, your opponent just repeats your words right back at you. So it is with this ad. Romney's comments about how 47% of Americans are freeloaders (ignoring the fact <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/hot-news-views/jon-stewart-fox-coverage-romney-47-video-chaos-bullsht-mountain\">many</a> are the working poor, retirees, injured veterans, students and, indeed, Republicans) were so toxic that the Obama campaign has cut an ad in which it simply plays the speech. </p> <p>This can be likened to the Saturday Night Live skits of Sarah Palin where, instead of a script, Tina Fey <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgRA8oTk8ig\">just repeated Palin's own quotes</a>. (That was enough to lampoon her as unfit to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.) This advert begins with Romney speaking:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"There are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what \u2026 who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As his stentorian voice drones on, the ad flashes up pictures of ordinary-looking Americans at home, at work or wearing their veterans' gear. They are presented in the sort of washed-out palate beloved of music video directors for tragic love songs. </p> <p>But they also look seriously annoyed. \"Do you mean me?\" they seem to be saying. But Romney goes on:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"So my job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Further portraits of incredulous-looking working-class Americans appear. Then, the ad fades to black. Not a single spoken word in the ad comes from anywhere but Romney's own mouth. It is astonishing, really.</p> <p>After score upon score of different political ads this electoral season, the one that really packs the most devastating punch is one that just shows Romney talking honestly and openly about his true beliefs among some of his biggest fans. And that should tell you everything you need to know about the dire state of his campaign.</p>",

Here is the latest dilemma \u2013 what are your thoughts?</p> <p><strong>I was made a verbal offer of employment by a pharmaceutical company about two weeks ago. I had five interviews and a long assessment to discover competencies, and was told I did very well indeed. </strong></p> <p><strong>After discussing salary, grade, location etc, as well as training events I was to attend in October, I was asked to have a meeting with the vice president \u2013 and assured this was not another interview.

  "<p>Australian officials, under pressure to protect beachgoers after a string of deadly shark attacks, have approved a plan to kill sharks that venture too close to people in the water.</p> <p>The plan, <a href=\"http://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Results.aspx?ItemId=151064\" title=\"\">which was announced by Western Australia state premier, Colin Barnett, on Thursday</a>, has infuriated conservationists and marks a sharp reversal of the current policy that permits the killing of sharks only after they have attacked.</p> <p>\"We will always put the lives and safety of beachgoers ahead of the shark,\" Barnett told ABC radio. \"This is, after all, a fish \u2013 let's keep it in perspective.\"</p> <p>Barnett, along with the state fisheries minister, Norman Moore, announced the policy change as part of a AU$6.85m (\u00a34.41m)) package of \"shark mitigation strategies\" aimed at reducing the risk of attacks on beachgoers.</p> <p>There have been five fatal shark attacks in Western Australia in the past year, prompting some residents to demand a more aggressive shark management plan. The new funding will pay for a fisheries department service to track, catch and kill sharks that get too close to swimmers, a study of shark enclosures at beaches, more jet skis for lifeguards and a GPS tracking program.</p> <p>Great white sharks are a protected species in Australian waters, but the new policy would allow fisheries department officials to kill any great whites that present an \"imminent threat to people\", Moore said.</p> <p>After an <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15414385\" title=\"\">American diver was killed by a great white in Western Australia last year</a>, the government set tuna-baited hooks to try and snare the predator. It was the first time authorities used an emergency legal exemption from the state protection of great whites to hunt the animal in the interest of protecting the public. The shark was never caught.</p> <p>The Conservation Council of Western Australia praised the additional funds for research and increased patrols but slammed the new pre-emptive kill policy as ineffective.</p> <p>\"We are concerned that plans to kill sharks that approach beaches applies a 'guilty until proven innocent' approach to sharks and is a knee-jerk reaction to public concern that will harm the environment without protecting swimmers,\" the council's marine coordinator Tim Nicol <a href=\"http://ccwa.org.au/media/%E2%80%98guilty-until-proven-innocent%E2%80%99-not-right-approach-large-sharks\" title=\"\">said in a statement</a>.</p> <p>Sharks are common in Australian waters, though the nation has averaged just over one fatal attack a year over the past 50 years.</p>"
