  "<p>A decade on from their split, this Montreal collective still sound like nothing else. Comprising two hypnotic 20-minute epics and two short, drone-based pieces, the reformed band's sixth album continues where 2002's Yanqui UXO left off, with a barrage of surging crescendos, drones and shimmering strings. The allure of the opening Mladic hinges on thudding rhythmic threats, all eight musicians lost in a storm of feral energy. After the menacing ambience of We Drift Like Worried Fire, the euphoric Their Helicopters Sing provides a celebratory release: an improvisational squall rises&#xa0;and falls before the band soar off on a Neu!-like rhythmic pulse. It's beautiful, thrilling and exhausting. The Godspeed ethos&#xa0;of wordlessly eliciting universal truths is remains as&#xa0;devastatingly effective as&#xa0;ever.</p>",
  "<p>Americans for Prosperity, the Tea Party-aligned group part-funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, is building a state-of-the-art digital ground operation in Ohio and other vital battleground states to spread its anti-Obama message to voters who could decide the outcome of the presidential election.</p> <p>The group hopes that by creating a local army of activists equipped with sophisticated online micro-targeting tools it will increase its impact on moderate voters, nudging them towards a staunchly conservative position opposed to President Obama's economic and healthcare policies. Americans for Prosperity (AFP) is spending tens of millions of dollars developing its local strategy, already employing more than 200 permanent staff in 32 states.</p> <p>Classified a non-profit \"social welfare\" organisation, AFP is legally obliged to project itself as a non-partisan campaign that neither endorses nor opposes candidates for public office. But there is no disguising its targets, nor their political nature.</p> <p>In Ohio, volunteers are given a script which they follow when engaging voters. \"President Obama took office three years ago and promised to fix our economy,\" they say, \"yet unemployment is still high and our debt is up to $6tn.\"</p> <p>AFP has already spent $30m so far this election cycle in opposing President Obama and other prominent Democratic candidates and their policies. It says it aims to reach up to 9 million targeted voters in crucial swing states, through the efforts of its 2 million activists.</p> <p>But it is ambitions do not stop on election day on 6 November. \"The goal is to build a long-term grassroots infrastructure,\" its president, Tim Phillips, told the Guardian. \"We are not some election-year group desperately trying to ramp up attention \u2013 we are in this year-in year-out to make a difference in favour of economic freedom.\"</p> <p>AFP's growing influence is highly visible in Ohio, one of the most crucial battleground states upon which November's outcome depends. It now has 80 paid staff operating in the state out of seven permanent offices.</p> <p>Volunteers are empowered with mobile canvassing technology that directs them to the households that are most likely to be influenced by AFP's message of small government and tax cuts through software built on to handheld tablet computers. They are also equipped with the latest phone banking technology through which they have made 400,000 calls to Ohio's voters since May.</p> <p>AFP's funding status allows it to raise unlimited sums from undisclosed sources, among them David and Charles Koch, brothers whose oil, coal and plastics businesses have earned them personal wealth of $25bn each. David Koch is president of the organisation's foundation.</p> <p><a href=\"http://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/2012/09/12/convention-or-ad-bounce/\">Research by the independent Wesleyan Media Project</a> has found that AFP is spending an astonishing $6m every two weeks on TV advertising that favours Mitt Romney's presidential candidacy. That pays for more than 7,000 TV ads to be served in the battleground states and outguns even Romney's own spending on political adverts.</p> <p>With the presidential race tightening across the country in the wake of Obama's widely denounced performance in the first TV debate earlier this month, all eyes have turned to Ohio, which Romney must win if he is to have a fighting chance of taking the White House. No Republican candidate in history has won the presidency without bagging Ohio's electoral college votes that today stand at 18 out of the 270 needed for victory.</p> <p>Polls vary widely in Ohio, making predictions difficult. But the latest tracking survey by Real Clear Politics has Obama two points ahead of Romney \u2013 a statistical tie.</p> <p>AFP is also waging an aggressive campaign against Sherrod Brown, the Democratic senator for Ohio, under the rubric: \"Has Brown worked for you?\" It has a fleet of vans bearing the senator's picture with the logo: \"Obama's rubber stamp for failure.\"</p> <p>Leading figures within the Ohio Democratic party have been watching the activities of AFP and other outlying conservative groups with mounting alarm. Ted Strickland, the former Democratic governor of Ohio, told the Guardian that in his view the activities of such groups had the capacity \"to move us from a democracy to an oligarchy where a handful of wealthy people use their money to try to control the political process\".</p> <p>Strickland said that Brown's struggle to get re-elected was a \"clear example of the corrosive influence of outside money. He should be 20 points ahead were it not for a massive amount of negative advertising coming from billionaires trying to buy a senate seat\".</p> <p>(Recent polls have put Brown and his Republican challenger, Josh Mandel, neck and neck, though the latest survey from the Columbus Dispatch shows the incumbent pulling ahead.)</p> <p>AFP's ground operation in Ohio and other states is built around an interactive online network that links its volunteers with a centralised database of information on millions of American voters. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/07/koch-brothers-database-2012-election\">The database, called Themis after the Greek god of wisdom</a>, was created with the help of seed money from the Kochs.</p> <p>The database draws information on voters from a range of public and commercial sources to create a profile of their likely political behaviour. What you buy on Amazon; the magazines your subscribe to; your friends on Facebook; your age, neighbourhood, occupation and house value; what petitions you have signed; what church you belong to; whether or not you own a gun \u2013 all such data points and many more go towards the creation of your personal, albeit anonymous, voter file.</p> <p>That, in turn, allows AFP activists to micro-target households with a level of precision that could only be dreamed about in previous generations. \"This is an exponential leap forward for our side \u2013 with Themis as our crucial partner, we are able to leverage our dollars and refine our message,\" Phillips said.</p> <p>Much media attention has been paid this election cycle to the avalanche of billionaires' money, including that of the Koch brothers, that has been spent on negative TV adverts. But in the longer term, the creation of this local lattice of activists able to identify key voters through online micro-targeting could prove to be a far more effective political weapon.</p> <p>In AFP's case, its interactive database serves up what the group calls an \"affinity score\" for each voter. He or she is awarded a number from 0 to 1. Those registering 0 on the scale being so leftwing and pro-government in outlook that, from the organisation's perspective, they are not worth bothering with.</p> <p>Those showing a 1 are equally worth bypassing because they are already so in favour of tax and spending cuts that to talk to them would be preaching to the converted. The technology is interactive, so that if a volunteer discovers that the affinity score of a voter on the doorstep is inaccurate \u2013 he or she is found to be more or less fiscally conservative than the rating suggests \u2013 it can be instantly corrected. The information is sent back at the push of a button to Themis, which is thus constantly updated and improved.</p> <p>The target group for AFP are those voters who fall between 0.4 and 0.6 on the affinity score \u2013 those moderate voters deemed by its digital planners to be \"persuadables\". \"Our goal is to get everybody into the 0.7 to 1 zone. We want to move the center towards economic freedom, to drive the debate through word-of-mouth marketing,\" says Matt Seaholm, the national field director of AFP.</p> <p>He added that in his view it was working; that AFP were driving the debate to the right. \"Cap-in-trade is now a dirty word. Stimulus is now a dirty word. Debt and spending are at the forefront. These were things that were not talked about in the past.\"</p> <p>AFP began testing its new micro-targeting gadgetry in Wisconsin last year, where it used the technology to energise its 120,000 activists in a succession of volatile recall elections. The group's efforts were one factor behind the survival of the Tea Party-backed governor, Scott Walker, in his recall vote this June.</p> <p>Phillips rejects the argument that AFP and other conservative outside groups are having a pernicious impact on the democratic process. \"We are proud to have the support of the Kochs. They have every right to be involved in the political process \u2013 they have been steadfast in this area for four decades.\"</p> <p>He added that for Obama and other Democrats to complain about corporate money entering politics was \"hypocrisy at its greatest. It's laughable, and most Americans know it. Obama receives tens of millions from Hollywood and the entertainment industry \u2013 so that is good money, and other money is bad?\"</p>",
  "<p>Put in the hands of Sherlock Holmes, the mystery of Britain's shrinking dole queues would be a three-pipe problem. Hundreds of thousands of people found work in the summer at a time when the economy was supposed to be dead in the water. If Britain is really in its first double-dip recession since the mid-1970s oil shock, isn't it a bit strange that a record number of people are in work and youth joblessness was down by 50,000 in the three months to August?</p> <p>For the past year, the economy has appeared to be a twitching corpse. Had the UK's top economists been set the task a year ago to predict the level of unemployment assuming a double-dip recession lasting nine months, they would have come up with a figure in the region of 3 million. Instead, the figure is currently just over 2.5 million.</p> <p>It's a puzzle that would test the skills of the occupant of 221B Baker Street and the game is certainly afoot in Whitehall to find a solution. Evidence is being examined and clues are being sifted in an attempt to find out how it can be that an economy that has contracted for three successive quarters has created 500,000 jobs in the past year.</p> <p>Any moderately competent detective would start by examining the reliability of the data. Are the unemployment figures \u2013 which are calculated in two separate ways \u2013 plain wrong? Some analysts think the surveys might be less reliable than they once were but the idea that the figures are being massaged by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) is a red herring. While the true level of joblessness, once those pensioned out of the workforce are included, could be a lot higher than the official figure of just over 2.5m, there has been no change to the way the figures are calculated in the past year that would explain the improvement in the labour market.</p> <p>A second \u2013 perhaps more fruitful line of inquiry \u2013 is that the unemployment figures might be right but the growth figures are wrong. Ministers would certainly like this theory to be true and would happily say \"case closed\" if facts could be provided to support it.</p> <p>There is certainly some circumstantial evidence. The quarterly growth figures tend to be revised, quite regularly and often years after the event. Sales of new cars to private buyers have been strong this year, which suggests there is life in the consumer yet.</p> <p>But this explanation also sounds a bit fishy. The ONS certainly doesn't believe it is getting growth estimates badly wrong, so it's worth digging around the labour market statistics to see whether any clues have been overlooked.<br>Happily, that does seem to be the case. The headline figures are all good, and should be welcomed as such. In the three months to August, employment was up by 212,000 and unemployment fell by 50,000. The unemployment rate, according to the internationally agreed yardstick, dipped below 8% to its lowest in a year, while youth unemployment \u2013 a particularly serious blight \u2013 was down by 50,000. There was even a small pickup in the rate of earnings growth. Forensic examination of the labour market data complicates the picture. </p> <p>John Philpott, director of thejobseconomist consultancy and an expert on unemployment, said that of the 212,000 jobs created in the latest quarter, one in three were mini-jobs of fewer than 15 hours work a week and more than half (54%) provided fewer than 30 hours.</p> <p>Philpott said it was good news that the mini-jobs were being taken by young people who would otherwise be classified as \"neets\" (not in education, employment or training), rather than students looking for jobs to see them through college. These jobs are not well paid and are insecure, but at least they ensure young people do not lose contact with the labour market altogether.</p> <p>There are other curiosities in the figures that create suspicion that the jobs market is not quite as strong as it looks. Scott Corfe, of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, notes that almost half the job creation over the past quarter was in one region, London. The Olympics had an impact here, with the drop in the claimant count in the six host boroughs over the past year roughly twice that in the non-Games boroughs. There has also been a longer-term trend of the south of England doing much better than the rest.<br>Seen in the round, the labour market data is more nuanced than it appears at first glance. Over the past year, the number of people working part-time has increased by 353,000 to 8.1 million. Of these, almost one in five are working part-time because they can't find a full-time job. What's happened is that firms have exploited the flexible labour market to bear down on pay and adjust working hours to meet weak demand, avoiding the need for mass layoffs.</p> <p>The solution to the mystery is that even a slow growing or stagnant economy can generate jobs. But only low-pay, low-hour jobs where the wages don't keep pace with inflation.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was updated at 16:20 on Thursday 18 December to reflect the final version of the article, which appeared on the front page of the 18 December edition of the Guardian.</p>",

Lancashire police issued an apology, the case was referred to the IPCC and the police announced an \"urgent investigation to understand what lessons can be learned\" from the incident which resulted in the victim being taken to hospital for treatment.</p> <p>At first sight this might look like a bizarre and isolated incident. Earlier this year though, the Metropolitan police had to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17366756\" title=\"\">pay out damages to a 16-year-old boy diagnosed with severe autism</a> after the high court ruled they had assaulted him by forcing him into handcuffs and leg restraints during a school trip. This case reflects much broader concerns raised by people who identify as on the spectrum of neuro-diversity, people diagnosed as having ADHD, Asperger's and Tourette syndrome, that their behaviour is often misinterpreted by the police as violent and aggressive and treated as criminal. Some have had Asbos placed on them. There seems to be a pattern of limited police understanding of disability and disabled people, often at critical times. This raises questions about the state of disability equality training among the police, which appears patchy at least.</p> <p>But there may be a much bigger issue here, both for the police and the rest of us. A key legacy hoped for from the 2012 Paralympic Games has been that it would help all of us rethink our stereotypes of disabled people. Instead of seeing them as passive and dependent, isolated and cut off from the mainstream, we would increasingly recognise their skills and abilities and their right to do the same things as non-disabled people, from going clubbing to forming relationships, from raising families to following careers. This is a far cry from the past when disabled people were invisible, either kept in institutions, segregated in day centres or restricted to their homes.</p> <p>Like the rest of us, the police have had to do a lot of catching up and it hasn't always been easy. Earlier this year there was the highly visible case of disabled student <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/aug/24/ipcc-upholds-protester-complaint-police\" title=\"\">Jody McIntyre</a>. His complaint about excessive police force in dragging him along the road from his wheelchair when he was protesting against student tuition fees was upheld by the IPCC. More to the point, it highlighted the contradictions of police behaviour in relation to disabled people. Here was a group that, if the police saw them at all, they were more likely to conceive of as the victims of crime rather than the perpetrators of disorder. The script for how to behave and react was not properly written.</p> <p>Yet since the emergence of the disabled people's movement in the late 20th century, the police have had to get used to wheelchair users chaining themselves in public places, protesting against inaccessible transport and cuts in services. And as disability activists have repeatedly reported, the police have not always been able to respond to disabled people's new assertiveness in positive or equal ways. There have been accounts of them being corralled without access to personal assistance and of their toileting and support needs not being met. The police service still need to find ways of treating disabled people as equals, without ignoring the particular barriers and difficulties that they may face.</p> <p>Disabled people have also reported big problems around police recognition of \"disability hate crime\". The police have been slow to acknowledge or record this problem. Now the situation is improving, but it still isn't clear if the growing statistics for such crime simply represent its increasing incidence, or disabled people's greater preparedness to report it, because of increased police understanding and awareness.&#xa0;</p> <p>The police have a complex role to play in relation to disabled people and disability at a time of change in their individual roles and public attitudes. All this at a time too when some politicians and media are cranking up negative stereotypes of disabled people in the name of welfare reform. Some mental health service users highlight the positive treatment they receive from the police when they are disturbed or behaving strangely in a public place, even if others have less reassuring stories to tell. Like the rest of us, the police need support and guidance if they are take forward the egalitarian and inclusive values highlighted by the Paralympics. And there is no one better equipped to provide this than disabled people themselves, and their own user-led organisations.</p>",

He said he initially thought he was being attacked by hooligans when he was struck by the Taser.</p> <p>The matter is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) after Farmer made a complaint to the force.</p> <p>Farmer, who used to run an architects' practice, was on his way to meet friends at 5.45pm and was walking in Peter Street near a restaurant. \"I was just walking along and I heard some men shouting really angrily and thought I'm going to get mugged.
