Watch here</a></p> <p>The expected <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/oscars\" title=\"\">Oscars</a> run for Steven Spielberg's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142607/war-horse\" title=\"\">War Horse</a> this time last year eventually manifested itself as more of a languid trot, with the poor old first world war filly finally staggering over the line with zero wins, from six nominations. Surely Lincoln, the American film-maker's biopic of the US leader who won the civil war and outlawed slavery, ought to return him to the Academy's bosom? Starring Daniel Day-Lewis as the 16th president of the United States, the historical drama is due on 9 November in the US and 25 January in the UK: prime timing for an Oscars tilt.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/tony-kushner\" title=\"\">Tony Kushner</a>'s screenplay, based on historian Doris Kearns Goodwin's book Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, reportedly focuses on Lincoln's fight to abolish slavery in January 1865 to his death in April the same year at Ford's theatre at the hands of assassin John Wilkes Booth, less than a week after the surrender of Confederate general Robert E Lee.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lincoln-teaser-spielberg-daniel-day-lewis-369127\" title=\"\">Paramount has just released a teaser trailer</a> \u2013 though it's more of a teaser for a trailer than for the film. The official trailer will be released on 13 September, during a Google+ video chat with Spielberg and one of his stars, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays Lincoln's son. In the meantime, we get a brief look at Day-Lewis in profile, looking uncannily like the best-known photographs of post-civil war Lincoln. The Oscar-winning actor has been known for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDVzmbtVZ6s\" title=\"\">delivering unorthodox intonations in the past</a>, of course, but surely that's not him delivering the Gettysburg address? We'll have to wait to find out.</p> <p>What do you think? Are you expecting Lincoln to mark a return to form for Spielberg, and another notch on the greatness post for Day-Lewis? Or is this a project so grand and portentous that its chances of going down in film history are conversely diminished?</p>",

He said the \u00a357m G4S management fee that the company was still demanding was actually only 15% profit \u2013 the rest covered the cost of the company's Canary Wharf operation that was used to employ and train the 10,000 private security recruits. The \u00a3236m total price tag was revised downwards from the original \u00a3280m that had been originally agreed before the breakdown in the contract was realised.</p> <p>It was also revealed that G4S paid nearly \u00a35m for their role in sponsoring the Games but Deighton insisted this marketing rights payment was completely separate from any consideration about the security contract.</p> <p>Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, who was effusive in his praise of Coe and Deighton \u2013 at one point he joked about Coe's pending \"canonisation\" \u2013 gently suggested that two reports by Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary should have set alarm bells ringing at Locog over the G4S contract.</p> <p>Vaz revealed that the conclusions of the HMIC report last September said the Locog security programme was behind schedule and \"may put aspects of security at the Games at risk\".</p> <p>Deighton said the organisers had commissioned their own consultants' report by Deloitte because they were not comfortable about the quality of G4S management information. However, while there were \"amber signs\" in the weeks before the Olympics, it was not until 12 July \u2013 two weeks before the opening of the Games \u2013 that G4S admitted the scale of its problems.</p> <p>\"The assurances we were getting from senior management, I believe they absolutely believed themselves,\" said Deighton.</p> <p>Coe, asked if G4S were solely to blame, responded: \"It is difficult to look beyond their inability to deliver when we were consistently being assured they would deliver.\"</p> <p>In particular he said he was \"acutely aware\" that some of the military personnel who were used to bail out the G4S operation had had to cancel family plans, especially as some of them had only recently been on active duty.</p>"
