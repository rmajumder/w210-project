  "<p>Unemployment in the eurozone has risen to a new record, with more than one in four out of work in Spain and Greece.</p> <p>There are now 18.49 million people without jobs in the 17 countries sharing the euro, said the European statistics office Eurostat on Wednesday with an extra 146,000 joining the ranks of the unemployed last month.</p> <p>Youth unemployment \u2013 joblessness among under-25s \u2013 rose to 23.3%, up from 21% during the same month a year ago.</p> <p>The prospect of high and rising unemployment, especially among younger workers, is expected to persuade the European Central Bank to cut interest rates in the new year from the current record low of 0.75% to support the flagging economy, which probably slumped back to recession in the third quarter, analysts said.</p> <p>But in contrast to the hope of stimulus from the ECB, Brussels and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/oct/31/europe-leaders-unemployment-economic-disaster\" title=\"\">most eurozone governments have put cuts in spending ahead of schemes to create jobs</a>, despite predictions that the situation will worsen over the coming months.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/31/portugal-tax-rises\" title=\"\">Portugal's right of centre administration</a> on Wednesday pushed through its third attempt at a budget for 2013, which is expected to lead to a third year of contraction and rising unemployment. Likewise <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/31/greek-unions-two-day-strike-austerity\" title=\"\">Greece's coalition government published \u20ac13.5bn of spending cuts and tax rises</a> that will result in a sixth year of falling GDP and and increase in the jobless rate.</p> <p>Eurostat said the jobless rate across the eurozone increased to 11.6% in September, the highest on record, from a revised 11.5% in August.</p> <p>The lowest unemployment rates were recorded in Austria (4.4%), Luxembourg (5.2%), Germany and the Netherlands (both 5.4%), which are near full employment. Spain (25.8%) and Greece (25.1% in July) had the highest unemployment in the eurozone, while France looks much like Italy (both at 10.8%), with a steady rise in joblessness. August data for Greece will be published next week, although the true picture is probably worse than the official figures show as a growing number of Greek workers remain nominally employed but have not been paid for some time.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the jobless data was \"dismal\", adding: \"Eurozone labour markets remain under serious pressure from ongoing weakened economic activity and low business confidence.\"</p> <p>Youth unemployment also hit a new high in Spain with 54.2% of under-25-year-olds out of work, up from 53.8%.</p> <p>Across the whole 27 nation European Union, 25.751 million men and women were without jobs last month \u2013 an increase of 169,000 from August \u2013 while the unemployment rate stayed at 10.6%.</p> <p>By comparison, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/17/uk-unemployment-falls-lowest-ons\" title=\"\">unemployment rate was 7.9% in the UK</a>, 7.8% in the US and 4.2% in Japan in September.</p> <p>There was some good news for the eurozone though \u2013 inflation eased to 2.5% in October, from 2.6%. Energy prices continued to rise, by 7.8%, but by less than the month before, when they climbed by 9.1% year-on-year. Food became dearer, however, with prices up 3.2% compared with 2.9% in September.</p> <p>Andrea Broughton, an economist at the Institute for Employment Studies said: \"Given the ongoing financial difficulties of the European Union and the likelihood of continuing job losses in the public sector as austerity measures begin to bite, overall unemployment levels and youth unemployment in particular are likely to carry on rising for the foreseeable future.\"</p> <p>She said a north-south split, which has dramatically opened up since the banking crash, would get worse.</p> <p>\"The trend is not upwards in all countries \u2013 unemployment levels actually decreased in seven member states on a year-on-year basis, including in Lithuania and Latvia, where it may be that the worst effects of the crisis are over. In Germany, although the economy is slowing there are as yet no adverse effects on unemployment, which has fallen on a year-on-year basis.\"</p> <p>In some countries the unemployment figures are depressed by a rise in emigration. Ireland, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain have seen a strong rise in the number of people, mainly young, seeking work abroad.</p> <p>Roughly 370,000 people emigrated from Spain in 2011, 10 times more than before the banking crisis hit the country in 2008.</p> <p>Although about 86% of them were naturalised immigrants born abroad, there is also a growing number of native Spaniards saying \"ya basta\" (\"enough is enough\"). More than 50,000 left last year, up 80% since before the crisis hit.</p>",
  "<p>One of the aspects of applying for teaching jobs which I get the most questions about is the personal statement. Do you need to write a letter of application in addition to completing the section in the application form which is entitled further information? My advice is simple, do both. One of the problems that many applicants have is trying to get their message across to the reader in the limited space that they have available so hence it is always a mistake to do one without the other. If you only complete one you may be struggling to keep your letter to a reasonable length or have a section of the application form that goes on for pages.</p> <p>Unfortunately some trainee teachers get so bothered about this aspect of the application that they slip up on other elements of their written application. So let's take a look at other parts of the form.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Completing the application form</strong></h2> <p>This should be the simplest part of the applying for a job but you would be surprised by how many applicants make a complete mess of the application form and in the current competitive school job market, the interviewer may only then give the letter of application a cursory glance.</p> <h2><strong>Electronic forms</strong></h2> <p>Nearly all schools will now provide an electronic copy of their application form. School leaders are expecting their new teachers to be ICT literate with solid skills ranging from using an interactive whiteboard to completing online reports. No matter how beautiful your handwriting, an application which is not word processed will immediately raise doubts in the interviewer's mind that you do not have the ICT skills required in today's schools.</p> <h2><strong>Dates</strong></h2> <p>The second most frequent error is the applicant who gets confused with some of their dates on the application form. This is an applicant's professional foul, as all interviewers will have completed their safer recruitment training and one aspect of this which is hammered home is that gaps in an applicant's history could raise safeguarding concerns. At the other end of the spectrum it just shows a slap-dash attitude. One suggestion is that before you start applying for jobs, complete a word processed document which has two sections: your previous employment history and your education/qualifications listed in reverse chronological order. If you spend a little time completing this list at your leisure when you are then rushing to complete an application form in between planning the next day's lessons you should be able to copy and paste the list line by line into the application form.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Don't leave any gaps</strong></h2> <p>If getting the dates wrong is a professional foul, then missing sections of the form really is a red card offence especially if the section you miss out is that where you have to disclose any criminal convictions. You would be surprised by the number of applicants who forget to complete this box when they have a completely clean criminal record and have nothing to hide. Yet again in today's safety conscious world, if you do miss that box out and the interviewer already has five strong applicants, then you may not make the shortlist for interview.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Further information</strong></h2> <p>As I suggested at the beginning of this article, the section of the form that can really make a difference to your application is the further information section. Where I always prefer to see a letter of application written in continuous prose, I am quite happy to see this section written in bullet points. Some of the best further information sections that I have seen are those who have taken the job description and tried to write notes on each point showing they have all the skills required by the school. If the interviewer is taking a very scientific scoring approach to shortlisting the applicants, by using this approach, you are making it much easier for them to check off that you are the ideal person for the job and the final signing for their team.</p> <h2><strong>Follow these golden rules</strong></h2> <p>\u2022 Always try to word process your application form</p> <p>\u2022 Ensure there is something in every box</p> <p>\u2022 Double check that the dates in your employment history and education are correct</p> <p>\u2022 Ensure the further information dovetails with your letter of application</p> <p>\u2022 Include information from your letter and other additional information</p> <p>\u2022 Be prepared to explain any gaps in service</p> <p><em>Paul K Ainsworth is a secondary school head teacher in Leicestershire and the author of <a href=\"http://www.continuumbooks.com/books/detail.aspx?BookId=161940&amp;SearchType=Basic\">Get that Teaching Job</a>.<br></em></p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>Last week <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/\">Policy Exchange</a> held a one day conference in Birmingham for Police &amp; Crime Commissioner candidates. The aim was to delve into some of the very real challenges that Commissioners will have to deal with from day one: the media, the public, concerns over outsourcing and what they need to do in the first weeks and months in office.</p> <p>The conclusion was, I think, overwhelming. Commissioners will have their work cut out for them. Some will inherit forces with strong management and a keen sense for fighting crime, others won't be so lucky.</p> <p>Those without a determined private office will find their diaries jammed with meetings: interest groups, local authorities, partner agencies, businesses, staff associations, members of the public and perhaps even a thinktank or two.</p> <p>They will be expected - if not required - to get to grips with managing the budget for a large organisation, while also mastering at least a basic knowledge of policing and the criminal justice system that lies beyond.</p> <p>In spite of all these challenges almost 200 candidates are standing in the 41 police areas affected. Many are independents - some with policing experience, others just with an interest in the issues. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/oct/23/police-and-crime-commissioners-police\">See the list of north of England candidates here.</a></p> <p>There is no doubt that a good commissioner, with a good team, and a good chief, will have the potential to make a real difference to the lives of the public: particularly those who find themselves disproportionately affected by crime, or the fear of crime. Often this is the poorest, youngest and oldest in our society.</p> <p>It is reasonable to expect debates on police governance to rumble on, but Commissioners - whatever the turnout on 15 November - are here to stay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398621822\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/pictures/2011/9/2/1314980610512/Manchester-riots-002.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester riots\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street violence in Manchester last year.

Commissioners can also be expected to welcome, celebrate and support those policing activities the public hold most dear and want more of: notably, community policing.</p> <p>It helps that foot patrol and preventative approaches have been shown to both cut crime and improve satisfaction, especially among those groups with a history of dissatisfaction or poor service. The challenge will be developing a sustainable approach to providing this.</p> <p>The absence of a taxpayer-funded mailshot for candidates, the late arrival of the official Home Office website, the decision to hold the election on a cold dark night in November and a media hungry for tales of woe, might all contribute to the idea of a failing policy. As might the failure of some candidates to even claim their profile on our own <a href=\"http://www.PoliceElections.com\">PoliceElections.com website</a>.</p> <p>However the real test will be in three and a half years time, when the public get to vote again, on a brighter day in May, for a role they better understand - and, crucially, when they can see what has or hasn't changed.</p> <p>The brightest and best Commissioners will, like the rest, face challenges - but the opportunity to make a real difference, to real people, living real lives is unprecedented. Furthermore, is there any more crucial or noble pursuit than the maintenance of law, order and public safety?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398621823\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351688658835/ror.jpg\" alt=\"policy exchange\" width=\"130\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Rory Geoghegan </strong>is Crime &amp; Justice Research Fellow at the think tank <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/\">Policy Exchange.</a> </em></p> <p><strong>The full line-up of candidates for the 12 PCCs in the north is on a <em>Northerner</em> post <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/oct/23/police-and-crime-commissioners-police\">which you can read here</a>.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/31/eurozone-unemployment-record-high-eurostat\" title=\"\">Unemployment in the eurozone has reached a new record high</a>. Here is what economists made of the Eurostat figures.</p> <h2>Ben May, European economist, Capital Economics</h2> <p>With surveys suggesting that firms are becoming more reluctant to hire, the eurozone unemployment rate looks set to rise further, placing more pressure on struggling households.</p> <h2>Tim Ohlenburg, senior economist, Centre for Economics and Business Research</h2> <p>Over the past week, Eurostat has delivered a string of statistics that don't bode well for the eurozone economy. Today, a reported rise in the unemployment rate to a new high of 11.6% for September is one item while another is the flash estimate of October consumer price inflation showing price pressures remaining elevated with a 2.5% year on year rise.</p> <p>The labour market continues to diverge across the currency union as a process of internal devaluation results in weak economic activity and falling wages in the periphery. In the core economies, the labour market is stable, which should ultimately lead to a narrowing of unit labour costs. Spain, now with 25.8% unemployed, is a particular source of concern. France looks much like Italy, exhibiting a steady rise in joblessness. Germany, on the other hand, is still operating near full employment.</p> <p>For the currency union as a whole, two other data points are worrisome. The latest figures for Q2 2012 show that households have been forced to reduce their savings to a euro-era low because real disposable incomes are depressed by weak income growth and significant food and energy price inflation.</p> <p>Secondly, with recession approaching eurozone governments are facing a similarly difficult time in reducing their debt burden. The debt to GDP ratio of the currency union has now reached 90.0%. Though this is driven by increases in the bailout nations, Italy, France and Spain, it illustrates a general point that it is difficult for the public and the private sectors to reduce their debt burden at the same time. Only large export gains could provide sufficient demand in this situation to keep the economy afloat, but with emerging markets slowing and both Japan and the US sliding towards their own sovereign debt crises there is no realistic prospect for that to happen.</p> <p>Financial markets have calmed somewhat, but we expect that the deteriorating economy will soon enough lead to more crisis headlines and a resurgence in bond yields. While the European Central Bank will assure liquidity, longer-term solvency is far from guaranteed. A full bailout for Spain and perhaps another for Italy are looming on the horizon.</p> <h2>Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist, IHS Global Insight</h2> <p>The modestly good news is that eurozone consumer price inflation edged down to 2.5% in October</p> <p>The very bad news is that the number of eurozone unemployed jumped by 146,000 in September taking the unemployment rate up to a dismal record high of 11.6%</p> <p>High and rising eurozone unemployment, and relatively sticky inflation, does not bode well for consumer spending across the eurozone, especially as consumers in many countries are also facing muted wage growth and tighter fiscal policy.</p> <p>With the further, appreciable rise in unemployment in September highlighting that the eurozone faces a difficult fourth quarter and beyond after almost certainly suffering further GDP contraction in the third quarter, and with the underlying inflation situation in the eurozone still looking far from alarming, we believe that the ECB will ultimately take interest rates down from 0.75% to 0.50%. We have pencilled an interest rate cut to 0.50% in December on the assumption that continuing weak economic data and surveys will gradually convince the ECB that lower interest rates are warranted. However, the ECB could delay trimming interest rates until early 2013 due to concerns that the impact of a near-term cut could be diluted by the problems in monetary policy transmission channels.</p> <h2>Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist, ETX Capital</h2> <p>That [the rise in the jobless rate] is not a surprise given the austerity measures implemented by various governments, deterioration in eurozone economic activity and struggling corporate profits across Europe. As such, investors have shrugged off the labour market data and instead amped up appetite for risk on the last day of October.</p>"
