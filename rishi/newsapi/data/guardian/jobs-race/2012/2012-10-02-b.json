  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>For eight series it has provided smash hits, screaming fans and deepening unease about one of the world's most racially divided societies.</p> <p>But on Tuesday, finally, the television talent show <a href=\"http://idolssa.dstv.com/News/13264/NewsKhayaWinsIdolsSeason8.html\" title=\"\">Idols South Africa</a> got its first black winner.</p> <p>Khaya Mthethwa, 25, won a nationwide vote against 23-year-old Melissa Allison, ending the dominance of racial minorities since the contest, based on Britain's Pop Idol, launched in 2002.</p> <p>The gospel-influenced Mthethwa, from Durban, had been the favourite to win and was backed by a vociferous campaign. Some fans reportedly bought multiple mobile sim cards so they could vote more than once.</p> <p>Mthethwa's season eight victory was announced at a gala event in Johannesburg featuring performances by local artists. Almost 3 million South Africans voted over the past week, broadcaster M-Net said.</p> <p>Idols has become a cultural litmus test 18 years after the end of apartheid, with viewers apparently tending to vote along racial lines.</p> <p>White people make up less than one in 10 of the South African population. But black contestants are said to be disadvantaged because Idols is shown on a subscription channel and viewers must pay to vote, meaning that voters are disproportionately from the white middle-class.</p> <p>When there have been non-white winners of the series, they were mixed race, a category often regarded as culturally separate from the black majority.</p> <p>On Monday <a href=\"http://www.timeslive.co.za/thetimes/2012/10/02/race-heats-up-in-idols-final\" title=\"\">South Africa's Times newspaper</a> noted that in each of the previous seven seasons of Idols, M-Net has had to defend itself against allegations of vote-rigging and racism.</p> <p>\"Smelling blood, black celebrities have, to use political-speak, canvassed and mobilised voters on Mthethwa's behalf, sensing that he is on the verge of changing the trend,\" the paper said.</p> <p>A famous picture of thousands of women marching against apartheid-era pass laws had been digitally altered to read \"SMS 08 to 37400. Vote for Khaya\", the Times added.</p> <p>A change in the racial trend seemed on the cards two years ago but strongly tipped <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/03/south-african-idol-black-winner\" title=\"\">Lloyd Cele</a> was eventually defeated by Elvis Blue. They split the winnings.</p> <p>Mthethwa takes home a prize package worth almost R1m (\u00a374,139), including a recording contract with Universal Music South Africa.</p> <p>He will start work on an album in the next two weeks.</p>",
  "<p>Senior Republicans in Congress have written to Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, claiming to have evidence of a previously undisclosed attack on the US consulate in Benghazi and threats to American ambassador in Libya in the months before he was killed.</p> <p>Darrell Issa, chairman of the House oversight and government reform committee, and Jason Chaffetz, chairman of a subcommittee on national security, are demanding Clinton hand over information about previous attacks and threats as Republicans step up pressure on the White House with accusations of incompetence and a cover-up over the assault that killed the US ambassador, Chris Stevens, and three other American officials last month.</p> <p>The letter says that US diplomats in Libya made repeated requests for increased security at the Benghazi consulate but were rejected by officials in Washington. The congressmen have called a hearing for October 10 and want Clinton to reveal what the state department knew about earlier incidents and how it responded to the growing security threat.</p> <p>Issa and Chaffetz have disclosed an attack on the US consulate on April 6 in which two Libyan former guards at the building who had been fired threw a homemade bomb over the fence. No one was hurt. That incident came two months before a bomb blew a large hole in the consulate gates, again without causing casualties. The second attack was already public knowledge.</p> <p>Issa and Chaffetz say that whistleblowers also pointed to other incidents that should have caused the US administration to better protect its diplomats in Benghazi. These include threats made openly on Facebook.</p> <p>An attack on the International Red Cross compound in May was followed by a claim of responsibility on Facebook which said it was a \"message for the Americans disturbing the skies over Derna\" \u2013 taken to mean US drones flying over a Libyan city that was a recruiting ground for anti-US insurgents in Iraq.</p> <p>The letter says that the following month a Facebook page linked to supporters of the dead Libyan dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, directly threatened Stevens and included a reference to his jogging route. Issa and Chaffetz say that \"after stopping these morning runs for about a week, the ambassador resumed them.\"</p> <p>Issa and Chaffetz also say that weeks before the assault that killed Stevens' and three other officials, Libyan guards at the consulate employed by a British company, Blue Mountain Group, were warned by family members to resign because of rumours of a looming attack.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/world/africa/mistaken-sense-of-security-cited-before-envoy-to-libya-died.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">The New York Times on Monday</a> reported that some American officials believe that the relatively small scale and swift response by Libyan security guards to the earlier incidents may have led to a false sense of security.</p> <p>Republicans accuse the Obama administration of misreading the warning signs in the run-up to the full scale attack on the Benghazi consulate on September 11, and then of covering up the true nature of what they say was a well-planned terrorist assault with links to al-Qaida.</p> <p>Senior Democrats accuse Republicans of playing politics with Stevens' death.</p> <p>The administration has rejected a call from congressman Peter King, chairman of the House homeland security committee, for Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the UN, to resign after she presented the White House's initial claim that the attack was spontaneous and a reaction to a short anti-Muslim video on You Tube that prompted protests across the Middle East.</p> <p>Issa and Chaffetz say the evidence in their letter demonstrates that the assault on the Benghazi consulate was well planned. </p> <p>\"It was clearly never, as administration officials once insisted, the result of a popular protest,\" the letter said.</p> <p>King echoed the criticism and accused the Obama administration of an intelligence failure in not reading the warning signs and giving sufficient protection to the consulate and Stevens.</p> <p>\"Why did the administration ignore these warning signals over the last few months? We had attacks on our own consulate, we had attacks on the British ambassador, we had attacks on the Red Cross,\" he told Fox News on Tuesday. \"It's such a dangerous area and yet nothing was done as far as securing the compound there. The ambassador was travelling with minimal security. And then when the event did occur, the administration went on for more than a week, two weeks, denying it was a terrorist attack.\"</p> <p>Republicans accuse the administration of shifting position after it acknowledged on Friday that there was a \"deliberate and organised terrorist attack\". However, there remains a strong difference of opinion over what that means.</p> <p>Republicans are choosing to equate \"terrorist attack\" with al-Qaida. A steady stream of members of Congress have appeared on Fox News to suggest that a Libyan militia could not have launched such a comprehensive and well-armed assault without outside help. Some critics point to the precision of mortar attacks during the assault which suggest well trained fighters, although they could have served in Gaddafi's army.</p> <p>Administration officials point out that there are several militias in Benghazi armed with weapons seized from Gaddafi's military during last year's revolution, which could have launched the assault on their own initiative. </p> <p>King accused the administration of a cover-up. \"It fits into the president's narrative that there's not really a threat from al-Qaeda, there's just a threat from a few radicals out there who get excited about a video,\" he told Fox News.</p> <p>\"The Obama administration has a view of the world and, whether they do it intentionally or not, they end up selectively putting in facts that fit into their narrative. The president's narrative is that al-Qaida has been decimated and the war against terrorism has been won, and now we can turn our attention to the Pacific.\"</p> <p>Another member of Congress, Marsha Blackburn, went so far as to compare the alleged cover-up with Watergate. </p> <p>\"This is why we need an independent counsel and we need the investigations top begin immediately,\" she told Fox News. \"Benghazi-gate is the right term for this. This is very, very serious; probably more serious than Watergate.\"</p> <p>Sorting the claims and counter-claims has been made more complicated by the failure of FBI investigators to visit Benghazi because of fears for their security.</p> <p>The Libyan government on Tuesday said plans are finally being made for FBI agents to travel to the city but that details of the cooperation agreement between the US and Libya on the investigation have still to be finalised. </p> <p>The state department said on Monday that it has now pulled all US officials out of the city and closed the consulate there.</p> <p>\"Everybody who was in Benghazi and posted there has been withdrawn,\" said the state department spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland. The US embassy in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, remains open with reduced staffing.</p>",
  "<p>I joined the Conservative party as a 20-year-old student. It was May 2008, the recession was just starting to hit and I just felt like it was time for a change.</p> <p>But I am very much in a minority. In the 2010 general elections only 16% of black and Asian voters backed the Conservatives. And black people in particular are not only less likely to vote, but we are also much less likely to vote Conservative than other ethnic minority communities. For many people who share my heritage, the Conservatives are seen as being out of touch, sometimes racist, and only caring about the rich. I think they're wrong, but I also think the Tories need to recognise this strength of feeling, and respond to it.</p> <p>Black people are becoming an increasingly large political force within the UK, and are becoming more organised, particularly within faith communities. A first step in attempting to reach new communities would be for the party to stop using the rhetoric of blaming immigration for seemingly every problem that the country is facing.</p> <p>We know that every race equality policy passed since the second world war came under the Labour government. Sometimes it appears that the Tories' sole passion when it comes to race is on immigration. History has taught us that many people love to blame those not born here for their problems. Even during the premierships of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, Labour talked tough on immigration so that voters who were unemployed, in a small house with a big family, or couldn't get the school they wanted for their child, could blame someone else. Refugees were accused in the media of being given mansions, and there was a growing though misplaced perception that asylum seekers were entitled to the same level of benefits as UK citizens.</p> <p>The ambitious pledge to reduce migration from over 100,000 to tens of thousands is a clear sign that the party feels immigration is a natural vote winner.</p> <p>But for the Conservatives to ever be able to attract a significant level of votes from Britain's growing minority population, their courting of this blame culture must stop. Recent figures suggest that the UK economy will lose around \u00a31bn because of the fall in the number of international students, and the problems with London Metropolitan University will further affect how Britain is perceived abroad by potential students, tourists, and ultimately investors. This cannot be seen as good news during such challenging economic conditions. Immigration does need to be controlled but it isn't the only reason for the economic mess that we are in today.</p> <p>Alongside this, the Conservative party should do more to recognise the massive disparity in stop and search, which has been an issue within the black community for years. Disproportionate unemployment, and major funding cuts to community groups, must also be addressed sympathetically. We must not be so lazy to think that because budgets are tight we cannot find solutions.</p> <p>The world is becoming increasingly global, and the same migrants who are vilified today could one day be the dual nationality citizens who will help to build relationships with emerging markets. In the years to come Conservatives, like myself, should not be saying the same things we are today; instead I hope to see a political system that has a more diverse representation. It's the best thing for everyone. Under David Cameron, much work has been done to broaden the Conservatives' appeal, but there is still some way to go.</p>"
