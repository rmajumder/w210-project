  "<p>As a persistent hum rings out, the eight members of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/godspeed-you-black-emperor\" title=\"\">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a> are drawn to the dark stage. Without a glance, they assume practised&nbsp;positions for this, the first of&nbsp;two nights, as the word \"Hope\" is projected on to a giant screen behind, marking the inauspicious start of what becomes a thrilling five-song, two-hour&nbsp;journey through the troubled heart&nbsp;of the 1990s post-rockers and perennial outsiders.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/oct/11/godspeed-you-black-emperor-interview\" title=\"\">Back together since 2010</a>, GY!BE have been relentlessly touring ever since, and&nbsp;it shows. As the hypnotic Hope Drone dies, it is wordlessly replaced by the tick-tock rhythm of Mladic, from the&nbsp;band's first album for a decade, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2012/oct/08/godspeed-you-black-emperor-stream?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend</a>. Named after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/16/ratko-mladic-trial-begins-hague\" title=\"\">the Serbian general</a>, Mladic sounds like a traditional folk song played by the devil. Packed with sharp riffs and punchy bass reminiscent of the Stooges, it is given a cinematic nihilism and punctilious intensity that only the Canadian band could pull off, with three&nbsp;queasy guitars and two basses swooping over brittle violin before exploding into a deadly dance.</p> <p>Never keen to play by the rules, the publicity-spurning, corporation-shunning GY!BE turn their backs on their latest release and dive instead into&nbsp;intoxicating oldie Gathering Storm, sending a sea of heads nodding. Footage&nbsp;of a dilapidated house in the woods spills from one of four projectors, lacing the sad, graceful melody with suspicion before a blistering cacophony erupts. Things get even heavier with the&nbsp;unreleased song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT9wQ0aStIM\" title=\"\">Behemoth</a>, a churning 45-minute epic that, by turns, sounds like the death throes of a dinosaur and the sassy theme to a cartoon spy caper.</p> <p>GY!BE let loose their political angst as&nbsp;the haunting melancholy of 1997's The Sad Mafioso accompanies blood red images of stock exchange figures and marching protesters. One holds aloft a placard that reads Take Back the Future, which is just what the vengeful GY!BE look determined \u2013 and ready \u2013 to do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?button_hashtag=GdnReview\"class=\"twitter-hashtag-button\">Tweet #GdnReview</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){ varjs,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script> </figure>  <p>What have you been to see lately?

  "<p>Officials in New York and New Jersey were engaged in a race against time on Monday to house vulnerable residents left in uninhabitable accommodations by superstorm Sandy before another storm hits this week.</p> <p>Overnight temperatures are set to drop to near freezing levels on Monday night, putting in focus the plight of up to 40,000 people in New York who need shelter from the cold amid ongoing blackouts.</p> <p>The \"massive, massive housing problem\", as state governor Andrew Cuomo has described it, comes as much of Manhattan began to get back to business as usual on Monday.</p> <p>With power restored to lower Manhattan and 90% of schools open, the city's network of subway lines were full with commuters and students as it operated a revised timetable.</p> <p>But further afield concerns were more grim. In the Rockaways \u2013 a coastal region in the borough of Queens \u2013 thousands of residents were without power for the seventh straight day.</p> <p>With temperatures dropping and a powerful new storm due to hit mid-week, city officials are facing an uphill battle to find alternative accommodation in a city where spare housing is scarce.</p> <p>On Sunday, mayor Michael Bloomberg said between 30,000 to 40,000 New Yorkers may need to be relocated as they could be without power for some days to come.</p> <p>\"We're not going to let anybody go sleeping in the streets \u2026 but it's a challenge, and we're working on it,\" he said.</p> <p>Governor Cuomo was likewise frank with his assessment.</p> <p>\"People are in homes that are uninhabitable,\" he told reporters at a press briefing. \"It's going to become increasingly clear that they're uninhabitable when the temperature drops and the heat doesn't come on.\"</p> <p>One option could be setting up mass trailer camps, similar to those that existed in New Orleans in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina in 2005.</p> <p>Of those that need temporary resettlement, it is thought that 20,000 currently reside in public housing. </p> <p>The storm this week could bring gusts of up to 55mph and further flooding.</p> <p>\"Prepare for more outages,\" was the advice of National Weather Service meteorologist Joe Pollina. \"Stay indoors. Stock up again,\" he added.</p> <p>The immediate concern facing those in cut-off areas is how to keep warm.</p> <p>\"Nights are the worst because you feel like you're outside when you're inside,\" said Genice Josey, a Far Rockaway resident who has slept under three blankets and wears long johns under her pyjamas in an effort to keep warm. \"You shiver yourself to sleep,\" she added.</p> <p>In parts of the badly hit borough of Staten Island, it was a similar story.</p> <p>\"When I woke up, I was like, 'It's freezing.' And I thought, 'This can't go on too much longer,'\" Sara Zavala said.</p> <p>Sandy has already been blamed for the deaths of some 113 people in the US, adding to the 69 killed as the hurricane made its way through the Caribbean.</p> <p>The fear now is that more people may die as a result of hypothermia. The elderly are particularly at risk.</p> <p>Adding to people's woes is the ongoing scarcity of gas. Long lines at the pumps has becoming a common scene across parts of New York and New Jersey.</p> <p>Part of the problem has been panic buying by motorists, who have been filling the tank in anticipation of gas running out. New Jersey governor Chris Christie tried to allay the fears of drivers on Sunday, stating that the state did not have \"a fuel shortage\".</p> <p>He had earlier ordered a rationing of supply to customers in a bid to head off dwindling supplies.</p> <p>To help ease the flow, President Barack Obama ordered his administration to release an additional 12m gallons of unleaded fuel and 10m gallons of diesel. Much of that gas was trucked to New Jersey and New York over the weekend and should be delivered by the time the new storm arrives.</p> <p>Meanwhile, politicians have begun turning up the heat on utility companies over their response to the crisis. A week after the storm struck hundreds of thousands of homes remained subjected to power outages.</p> <p>On Sunday, Cuomo warned power suppliers that they would be held accountable for any delays that could have been prevented.</p> <p>\"I want them to provide the service that they get paid to perform,\" he said, adding: \"We will be reasonable, but we will hold them accountable.\"</p>",

  "<p>A cheerful note to start the week: the <em>Guardian Northerner</em>'s first Bloggers Weekend was a major success, thanks to the weather god or gods and a young couple called Suzie Brett and Martin Lyne.</p> <p>Regulars in the Lake District will know them as the exemplary wardens for the past two years of that shrine for fellwalkers, <a href=\"http://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/black-sail\">Black Sail youth hostel</a> in the far reaches of Ennerdale, beneath the bastions of Great Gable, Kirk Fell and Pillar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398848849\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352103647588/enner5.jpg\" alt=\"black sail\" width=\"460\" height=\"292\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heaven on earth: Black Sail youth hostel this weekend, with Great and Green Gables and Kirk Fell in snow behind.

Suzie and Martin are moving on, initially to cycle out to Turkey and other parts of the Middle East to use their energy and enthusiasm as English teachers. We were the last party to enjoy their curries and wine cellar at the former shepherds' bothy, seven miles' walk from the car park at Bowness Knott on Ennerdale Water.</p> <p>New hands will take over when the hostel reopens next Spring (apart from the YHA's <a href=\"http://www.yha.org.uk/escape-to\">weekend self-catering bookings </a>which continue over the off-season without resident wardens). Black Sail is also going to benefit from a major overhaul, although thankfully not the<a href=\"http://www.livefortheoutdoors.com/News-Landing/Search-Results/Outdoor-headlines/Special-report-The-future-of-Black-Sail-Youth-Hostel/\"> transformation originally planned </a>by the Association.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398848850\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352103682207/enner1.jpg\" alt=\"black sail\" width=\"460\" height=\"311\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Setting out.

That approach is working at other YHA premises, but at Black Sail the 16 bunks, outdoor loos and mountain hut atmosphere - complete with curries made by someone else - <em>are</em> the place. They are what its visitors, of whom there has never been a shortage in all its 75 years, go to enjoy.</p> <p>To its credit, the YHA <a href=\"http://www.grough.co.uk/magazine/2008/11/21/hot-meals-back-on-menu-after-black-sail-u-turn\">listened and changed its mind</a>; a process which also gets plenty of comments in the visitors' book, this time warmly approving. The tiny cabin will retain its character as part of 'Wild Ennerdale', a combined approach to the valley by all involved in its welfare which <a href=\"http://www.wildennerdale.co.uk/\">you can read more about here</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398848851\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352103725415/enner3.jpg\" alt=\"black sail\" width=\"460\" height=\"299\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bright ideas.
