  "<p>Last week, Mitt Romney and President Obama traded insults in a most amazing way, reminding us that success in American politics these days requires two things: saying the most absurd things with a straight face, and maximizing the appearance of differences with your opponent, while minimizing their reality. Consider \u2026</p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> </p> <blockquote> <p>\"I've learned some lessons. Most important is you can't change Washington from inside, only from the outside.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> </p> <blockquote> <p>\"He said he can't change Washington from inside. He can only change it from outside. I can change Washington. I will change Washington. We'll get the job done from the inside.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> </p> <blockquote> <p>\"What kind of inside job is he talking about? Is it the job of rubber-stamping the top-down, you're-on-your-own agenda of this Republican Congress? Because if it is, we don't want it \u2026 We don't want an inside job in Washington.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, Romney's a pretty obvious case of Mr Insider. But let's look at Obama. He doesn't want an inside job? Over the last four years, Obama has appointed nothing but insiders \u2013 many of whom had actively contributed to the financial crisis and profited from it \u2013 to his administration's senior regulatory, law enforcement, and economic policy jobs. The head of the SEC, Mary Shapiro, was fresh from running the investment banking industry's \"self-regulator\", Finra, which gave her a $9m severance bonus to soften the pain of a low government salary. Her director of enforcement, Robert Khuzami, had been general counsel for the Americas of Deutsche Bank during the bubble.</p> <p>The head of the justice department criminal division, Lanny Breuer, had been in charge of the white-collar criminal defense practice of Covington &amp; Burling, a law firm that represents and lobbies for nearly every major bank. The head of the office of management and budget, Jacob Lew, made millions as the chief financial officer of Citigroup Alternative Investments, even as that group lost billions for Citigroup. As head of the National Economic Council, we got Larry Summers, who as Clinton's treasury secretary pushed through the repeal of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_Act\">Glass-Steagall</a> and a law banning regulation of OTC derivatives, and who then proceeded to make $7m from financial services firms in the year prior to joining the Obama administration (including $135,000 for a single speech to Goldman Sachs). Other senior jobs went to Goldman Sachs lobbyists, investment bankers, private equity executives, and the <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/obama-administration-hires-lobbyist-it-attacked-in-2008/\">former chief lobbyist of Fannie Mae</a>.</p> <p>And beyond Obama's personnel, there were his policies. He did nothing about the obscene $14bn in bonuses awarded in early 2009 by banks that would literally have been bankrupt without federal bailouts; he failed to prosecute even a single bank or financial executive despite clear evidence of rampant, systemic fraud; and he has since attempted only the most pitiful of systemic reforms.</p> <p>Nor is this pattern restricted to the financial sector: despite the worst oil spill in history, one that killed 11 people, and a lethal mine disaster that followed deception of safety inspectors, there have been no prosecutions of energy executives, either. And it all shows: in this campaign, Obama has actually raised more money than Mitt Romney, the poster boy of plutocracy.</p> <p>Well, I'll be the first to admit that I have a personal axe to grind. Like, how do I know all this stuff? Well, two years ago, I made a <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1645089/\">documentary film about the financial crisis</a>, followed recently by a book. The film, based on a year of research and nearly 100 on-camera interviews, chronicled the thoroughly bipartisan process of deregulation, political corruption, and lack of law enforcement that paved the way for the financial crisis. It concludes with a detailed examination of the Obama administration's abysmal record.</p> <p>The film won the Academy Award for best documentary in 2011; in my Oscar acceptance speech, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpz5DVwnbnk\">I called out the lack of criminal prosecutions</a>, to audience applause. The title of this film? I never thought you'd ask.</p> <p>Inside Job.</p> <p>So there you have it \u2013 my real gripe is that Obama stole my title for his petty spat with Romney, each of them pretending to be the guy who would fix Washington corruption \u2013 when, of course, neither of them would.</p> <p>I should say for the record that despite the foregoing, I support President Obama's re-election. For all Obama's faults, Romney and the new Republican party would be even worse. Obama has at least tried to do a <em>few</em> things, some of the time, however timid. Not to mention little details like gay marriage, abortion, climate change, tax returns, et cetera.</p> <p>But the sad truth is that the more the two candidates pretend to be at each other's throats, the more similar they are in reality, at least where money is concerned. They would both let America's new financial oligarchy run amok, at the nation's great expense. This is just one domain among many in which both candidates avoid the truth, preferring to trade blows in the theater of the absurd.</p>",
  "<p>We've become used to exam standards dominating a day or two of the summer news agenda then fading away. This year is different. Well into the autumn term assessment is still in the news. The debacle of the marking of this year's English papers is still unresolved and now the very future of GCSEs is open for debate. The two issues have become intertwined, with this year's English marking being used to bolster the case for abolishing GCSEs \u2013 but they need to be de-coupled.</p> <p>Let's be clear. The English marking problem was the consequence of errors by both the exam boards and Ofqual, the organisation responsible for regulating them, and although the government certainly shouldn't interfere with marking, it does have an overriding responsibility to safeguard the reputation of exams and to act against ineptitude. All have failed this summer, letting down thousands of young people and their teachers.</p> <p>This fiasco has provided a very convenient launch pad for the government's announcement on the future of GCSEs. The assertion that the modular nature of GCSEs caused this summer's problems has been perfect cover for a return to end-of-course assessment. I fly no flag for modular assessment \u2013 I had my own problems when modular A-levels were introduced a decade ago on my watch as secretary of state \u2013 but to use this year's errors to shape the future of an important examination is plain irresponsible.</p> <p>Assessment might lead this policy announcement but the proposal heralds a more fundamental change: it gives us a glimpse of the government's vision for our school system and its aspirations for a generation of children. And it suffers from three significant fault lines.</p> <p>First, it is a missed opportunity for really radical reform. Assessment at the age of 16 is a relic from when most children left school at that age. Now, 16 is part way through what should be a coherent 14-19 curriculum. The examination should have been brought forward to the end of year 9, which is when the national curriculum finishes.</p> <p>Second, it bears all the marks of a policy drawn up by two parties that fundamentally disagree. The proposal Michael Gove first floated was a similar narrow qualification but aimed at a minority of the age group \u2013 openly talked about as a return to O-levels.</p> <p>The line drawn in the sand by Liberal Democrat partners was that there should be no return to a two-tier system and all students must be assessed through the same examination. Whereas Gove's ideas might have been fit for purpose as an elite part of a two-tier system, they are inadequate as assessment for the whole ability range. We are being sold a politically expedient botched job.</p> <p>Third, the proposals are rooted in the past and show little understanding of the society that surrounds children growing up at the start of the 21st century. That world has changed since O-levels. Of course, the facts and knowledge that the curriculum has traditionally passed down remain important \u2013 but they are no longer sufficient.</p> <p>In a world transformed by science and technology, a new set of skills, attitudes and knowledge have also become important. Creativity and communication, team work and flexibility; learning through doing and excellence in practical skills, let alone fluency in technology itself, will be what divides successful nations from also-rans.</p> <p>The government's proposals don't prohibit these things, but neither do they indicate they are valued. Experience shows that what is assessed is what schools teach. It will be so again.</p> <p>Gove seized on this summer's examination difficulties to strengthen his case for the changes he favours. He has constructed a narrative that persuades him there is a halcyon past, redolent of the schoolroom he once sat in, that can be resurrected to guide our future.</p> <p>It's an argument that uses the old trick of appealing to the sentiment we all sometimes feel \u2013 that things used to be better. It might be good politics. It's far from good education.</p>",
  "<p>Racegoers who want to see the colt described in various quarters as the best we have ever seen in a horse race are being urged to call Ascot racecourse quickly with the track announcing on Monday that the extra 1,500 tickets released for Frankel's appearance on Champions Day are expected to sell out by Wednesday.</p> <p>However, an earlier opportunity to catch a glimpse of the world's highest-rated racehorse arrives on Saturday when Frankel gallops before racing at Newmarket.</p> <p>It is a rare occasion in the sport when a card featuring two Group One races, a Group Two and one of the most famous handicaps on the British turf is rivalled by a pre-race gallop but after Frankel's explosive performances this summer at Royal Ascot, Glorious Goodwood and York's Ebor meeting that is definitely the case.</p> <p>Frankel is due to work under Tom Queally an hour before the first race and his trainer, Sir Henry Cecil, is expected to attend, despite still fighting a throat infection, a side-effect of treatment for stomach cancer which has left him struggling to find his voice.</p> <p>\"We're delighted that Frankel will be coming to the track as he is such an awesome horse to watch when at full stretch,\" said Newmarket's spokesman, Tony Rushmer. \"Sir Henry plans to bring him along with Bullet Train and Midsummer Sun to work at 1pm. Frankel will be saddled up at the racecourse and then brought into the pre-parade ring for a couple of circuits before going out on to the track. Prince Khalid [Abdullah, Frankel's owner] has also agreed to allow the horses to work in three varieties of his silks in order to help with identification.\"</p> <p>The workout will be shown live on the Racing UK channel while Newmarket have also moved quickly to seize on the interest in the horse by marketing a 'Brunch with Frankel' event at the track.</p> <p>In view of Frankel's planned participation Newmarket officials were relieved at missing the worst of the national deluge and officials say the going remains officially good for the three-day meeting, which gets under way on Thursday.</p> <p>Ascot's decision to offer another 1,500 tickets by creating a new temporary facility, upping the 20 October Champions Day capacity to 32,000, was rewarded by the sale of 750 on Monday and the remainder are expected to be gone within the next 48 hours.</p> <p>But there are no plans for further expansion, with the course's spokesman, Nick Smith, admitting that lessons had been learned from previous negative feedback.</p> <p>\"There's just no question of us cramming people in as our priority is that we give every customer as positive an experience as possible,\" he said. \"The Silver Ring doesn't have the facilities to support it being opened up beyond the Royal meeting and the Heath enclosure can't operate because the ground is being protected for the jumps season.</p> <p>\"If it rains, we need to be sure that we can get everyone comfortably under cover. We believe that 32,000 is the most we can manage that with and it was a unanimous [Racing Enterprises Limited] board decision to stick to that number.</p> <p>\"The truth is that we have never before held a raceday at this stage of the year where there has been this kind of demand for tickets. Yes, you could say that we have been blessed by having Frankel for the first two years of the fixture but nevertheless it is proving as popular as we could have hoped.\"</p> <p>The French 1,000 Guineas winner, Beauty Parlour, who became a stablemate of Frankel in July when transferred from Elie Lellouche to join Cecil's team, could make her debut for her new yard in Saturday's Sun Chariot Stakes. Also due to line up in the race are the fellow Group One scorers Elusive Kate, Chachamaidee, La Collina and Emulous.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/aug/03/ukcrime.sophielancaster\" title=\"\">Sophie Lancaster</a> was a 20-year-old goth with dreadlocked hair. On 11 August 2007, she and her boyfriend, Robert Maltby, went to talk to a group of teenagers in Stubbylee park in Bacup. The group turned on them. As she tried to protect Maltby from their assault, Lancaster was kicked so viciously that her face was left imprinted with the shape of a metal star from the end of some trainer laces. She never regained&nbsp;consciousness.</p> <p>First produced on Radio 4, Black Roses is an elegy for Sophie. It intercuts Sylvia Lancaster's recollections of her daughter with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/12/poetry-should-be-subversive\" title=\"\">Simon Armitage</a>'s first-person poetic sequence, which gives the silenced Sophie back her voice. Sophie was a vegetarian and a pacifist. What was it about her and Maltby that so aggravated their attackers? \"Something in their lives despises ours. The difference between us is what they can't&nbsp;stand.\"</p> <p>Sarah Frankcom and Susan Robert's simple, moving production is played out on a set designed by Amanda Stoodley. This creates a physical separation between the living and the dead, the domestic and the poetic, and cunningly offers a vision of a green and pleasant England where the birds always sing and there are no threatening shadows. What follows reveals that vision as a lie.</p> <p>Sophie is played with unshowy command by Rachel Austin, and Julie Hesmondhalgh is superb as Sophie's mother, struggling to make sense of her daughter's life and death. The play may not entirely escape its radio origins, but it gains a great deal on stage: Sophie's beauty and difference are underscored because they are visible. \"Now let me go. Now carry me home. Now make this known,\" says Sophie. Black Roses makes it known that hate crimes take many forms.</p> <p>\u2022 What have you been to see lately?

  "<p>Public relations exercises usually bring out my cynical side, so it was quite a surprise to hear of one two weeks ago that I actually liked: the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/09/01/ale-chief-white-house-beer-recipe\">White House published two recipes for beer</a>. These, we were told, are made in the White House for, if not actually by, the President, under his instructions and paid for out of his own pocket. My scorn deserted me and I warmed to President Obama as never before. Not only had he demonstrated that he was indeed the sort of guy you could enjoy a beer with, he had also given the world something that is actually of use. If only all politicians were so thoughtful.<br><br>Like most brewing enthusiasts who came across them, I studied Obama's recipes for White House Honey Ale and White House Honey Porter closely, wondering what they would actually taste like. While an experienced brewer can make an educated guess at their qualities, the only way to really find out what they'd be like was to make them. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396641002\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348477496256/A-selection-of-the-malts--006.jpg\" alt=\"A selection of the malts used in President Obama's beer recipes\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A selection of the malts used in President Obama's beer recipes. Photograph: John Wright</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Wright</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a daunting list of ingredients including several malts, several hops, some specialist yeasts and an assortment of other esoteric ingredients. They are all available in the UK with a bit of searching, or in my case, a bit of help. I called my friend Coreen from <a href=\"http://www.dorsethomebrew.co.uk/shop/\">Dorset Homebrew</a>, told her what I was up to and she put all the ingredients together for me. The intractable exception was White House honey which, despite my extensive connections in high places, proved impossible to acquire. I settled for local Dorset honey, consoling myself with the thought all the food miles I would save. </p> <p>The only other ingredient that gave me pause was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_sugar\">corn sugar</a>, but that just turned out to be another name for dextrose. I kept as closely to the recipe as I could except that I made half batches of each beer, a practical step as it removes the need for a saucepan the size of a dustbin. I also added some carragheen <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finings\">finings</a> at the same time as the second lot of hops to help clarify the beer \u2013 it was not in the recipe but I thought it would do no harm. </p> <p>As with all beers the sugar from which the alcohol is made comes from malted barley (or other grain). The White House recipes save time and hard work by using a malt extract but a variety of malted grains are also employed to allow the development of more complex flavours than from an extract alone \u2013 particularly in the case of the porter, which uses roasted grains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396641003\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348477272289/White-House-beer-recipes--008.jpg\" alt=\"White House beer recipes as brewed by John Wright\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">White House beer recipes as brewed by John Wright. Photograph: John Wright</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Wright</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Well, the results are in and the news is good, mostly. The Honey Ale is a pleasant light drink if not exactly a revelation for the palate; it has also turned out mysteriously cloudy and I would be interested to hear if anyone has any idea what I might have done wrong. I have not the slightest doubt that any failings in this brew are entirely my own doing, not President Obama's. </p> <p>The Honey Porter however is quite splendid. I don't much like dark beers, having been treated with (rather than to) a daily dose of powerful stout as a child. Obama's brew has rather changed my mind. It is not overpoweringly bitter, not too treacly and not too toasty. The grains, hops and Nottingham yeast have combined to produce something which is rich and dark, clear, complex and fragrant. As the original White House press release said \u2013 \"Ale to the Chief!\"</p>"
