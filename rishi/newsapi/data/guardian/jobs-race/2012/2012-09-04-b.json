  "<p>Squash 'em! That was the advice I was given on finding a little colony of cabbage white butterfly caterpillars. Many gardeners struggling against weather and weeds to maintain an aesthetic or productivity will be moved to violence when faced with the indolence of \"pests\" freeloading off their lovingly tended plants. There is a kind of moral indignation about wild Nature wriggling out of control and nibbling the precious produce as if it's a premeditated crime.</p> <p>Even now those attitudes jump the garden fence and inflict themselves on the environment. In this case the caterpillars were feeding on garlic mustard, a cabbage relative and therefore the prerogative of cabbage whites. The caterpillars had recently hatched from a cluster of eggs. Bristly, green and yellow like little commuter trains, their shear-like jaws chomped succulent leaf, leaving only a skeleton of veins as if the plant had been zapped by some alien death ray. The caterpillars worked together quickly, efficiently. They seemed so vulnerable \u2013 and slightly frantic, as if they had to get as much food&#xa0;into the wrinkly sleeping bags of their skins before being eaten themselves, or squashed.</p> <p>All this, just to grow, then pupate, then fly away as a butterfly to lay its own eggs. There's a lot about the idea of metamorphosis that we accept on faith. The difference between those gobbling grubs and the paper-white flutterers they will become is astonishing. Perhaps caterpillars and butterflies look so different because they are? That was the fascinating view of biologist Donald Williamson, whose evolutionary theory of hybridogenesis considered butterfly metamorphosis to be a result of larval transfer between velvet worms \u2013 the caterpillars and insects \u2013 and butterflies. Like many good ideas and things that don't fit in, that was squashed too.</p>",
  "<p>The Conservatives' first full reshuffle has left the cabinet slightly more male, more Oxbridge, with fewer people from ethnic minorities and with a more pronounced southern bias.</p> <p>Though the demographics are only slightly changed by the reshuffle, the new cabinet makes David Cameron's goal to have women in one third of government posts by the end of this parliament remote, and his wider modernisation agenda \u2013 to make the party more appealing to non-white voters, people outside the traditional, southern Tory heartlands, lesbian, gay and other minority groups \u2013 more difficult.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/sep/04/cabinet-reshuffle-coalition-cameron-data\" title=\"\">Analysis by the Guardian</a> reveals the changes between the new and old cabinets. The changes are dominated by Cameron's reshuffle since the Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, left his five cabinet members unchanged.</p> <p>The cabinet is two posts bigger and more Tory after the former justice secretary Ken Clarke and ex-party chairman Lady Warsi both remained in the cabinet.</p> <p>But the detail is possibly more telling about the struggle Cameron is having modernising his party at the top.</p> <p>Before Tuesday's changes, there were five women among the 29 full cabinet members, all of them Conservatives. Caroline Spelman and Cheryl Gillan have lost their seats in cabinet; Maria Miller and Theresa Villiers have been brought in and Warsi was demoted to a minister who attends cabinet but does not vote. On balance the number of women remained the same, but there are two more seats for men at the table.</p> <p>The shadow equalities minister, Yvette Cooper, tweeted: \"So looks like 3 of 5 women (Spelman, Gillan, Warsi) &amp; 1 of 19 men (Young) sacked from cabinet posts. Shows Cameron's attitude to women.\"</p> <p>Ceri Goddard, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, also attacked Cameron's lack of progress. \"Despite near universal acceptance that we need more \u2013 not less \u2013 involvement of women in building our economy, the prime minister has chosen to further marginalise women's influence on politics,\" said Goddard. \"Sweden, Switzerland and France all have equal numbers of men and women in their cabinets. Why can't we?\"</p> <p>Some of the party's female MPs were more pragmatic, however, stressing the importance of promoting women from the big influx of 2010 into junior ministerial ranks to prepare them for future cabinets. \"The PM has limited room for manoeuvre at the top end and has done the best he can by promoting both Maria Miller and Theresa Villiers, [and] at the junior ministerial level I am hopeful we will see more women appointed some of whom have great potential,\" said Margot James, a party deputy chairman, who also welcomed the promotion of a Lib Dem female MP, Jo Swinson.</p> <p>Penny Mordaunt, a new MP and member of the defence select committee, also warned against token women's appointments: \"As with chaps it must be on merit, expertise, talent and their ability to deliver.\"</p> <p>Warsi's move demotes the only non-white member of the cabinet, and the promotion of Chris Grayling appears to put two opponents of expanding gay rights in the cabinet since he sits alongside Owen Paterson, who has spoken publicly against legalising gay marriage.</p> <p>After two years of jibes about the party being led by southern posh boys, epitomised by the infamous photos of George Osborne and David Cameron in the tails of Oxford's Bullingdon drinking club, the Tory side of the cabinet has lost its majority of public schoolboys, with two more members from grammars and two more from state schools, though the number of Oxbridge graduates is slightly higher. Meanwhile there are the same number of northern MPs, but more secretaries of state born in or representing southern constituencies \u2013 despite the border being so far south that Birmingham qualifies as \"north\".</p>",
  "<p>A rise in Spanish unemployment \u2013 already the highest in Europe at 25% \u2013 added to the woes of prime minister Mariano Rajoy as he tried to fight off a bailout of the eurozone's fourth largest economy.</p> <p>With the economically vital tourist season coming to a close and the country sliding further into double-dip recession, Spain's dole queues looked set to get still longer over the coming months.</p> <p>Increased unemployment benefit payments are already putting pressure on Rajoy's budget plans, with figures released on Tuesday showing a 5% increase for the first seven months of the year. The budget minister, Crist\u00f3bal Montoro, had predicted that benefit payments, which fall over time for the long-term unemployed, would actually come down by 5% this year.</p> <p>The miscalculation may add several billion euros to the budget deficit, ramping up pressure on Rajoy as the recession hits tax income, borrowing costs soar and big-spending regional governments struggle to finance themselves and reduce their own deficits.</p> <p>With the markets on tenterhooks ahead of Thursday's meeting of the ECB, the bad news from Spain compounded a decision by Moody's ratings agency to place the entire European Union on negative outlook, citing the mounting financial strain of the crisis on key countries like Germany, France and Britain. Britain's FTSE 100 closed down 1.5% at 5672.01 while Germany's DAX lost 1.2% to 6932.58 and France's CAC 40 dropped 1.6%. The Dow Jones industrial average on Wall Street dropped 0.6% as the key ISM manufacturing index showed the sector continuing to shrink last month.</p> <p>Analysts increasingly believe that Spain, which has already been given up to \u20ac100bn of eurozone money to rescue its banks, will be forced into seeking a full bailout.</p> <p>Jens Nordvig, a forex strategist at Nomura, said that capital flight from Spain was an indicator that the country was on the path to bailout. Some \u20ac98bn left in May and June alone.</p> <p>\"The scale of capital flight that took place over the last few months in Spain supports this view,\" Nordvig wrote in a note to clients quoted by CNBC, adding that capital flight from Spain was now worse than from Indonesia during the 1990s crisis in Asia.</p> <p>Spanish banks will start tapping a \u20ac100bn bailout facility in coming weeks as they struggle to cope with a vast pile of toxic real estate assets left over from a property bubble that exploded four years ago.</p> <p>Four Spanish banks, including the fourth biggest, BFA/Bankia have been part-nationalised after being overwhelmed by the bad loans they gave to real estate developers.</p> <p>Bankia needed a further \u20ac4.5bn emergency injection of capital from Spain's state FROB rescue fund on Monday as it prepared itself for the eurozone bailout.</p> <p>In the first half of this year alone the four nationalised banks increased the amount of toxic real estate assets on their books from \u20ac56bn to \u20ac71bn as loans continued to sour, according to a study of their accounts by El Pa\u00eds newspaper.</p> <p>Bankia admitted to some \u20ac3bn (or 10%) more in loans to developers than it did six months ago.</p> <p>This was not because it had started lending again, but because these loans had only recently been reclassified at the former savings banks which came together to form Bankia.</p> <p>Bankia and the other nationalised banks \u2013 CatalunyaBanc, NCG Banco/Novagalicia and Banco de Valencia \u2013 are due to offload their toxic real estate onto a new bad bank which will be set up by the end of November as part of the eurozone rescue deal.</p> <p>The \"bad bank\" will have up to 15 years to sell them and try to make a profit.</p> <p>Some \u20ac28bn worth of property has already been foreclosed by these banks, meaning that they now own it, with almost half of that building land in a country that already has some 600,000 unsold residential properties.</p> <p>Rajoy will meet Germany's Angel Merkel in Madrid on Thursday, the same day that European Central Bank boss Mario Draghi is expected to reveal details of a plan to shore up Spanish and Italian bond prices.</p> <p>Moody's credit rating agency is due to review Spain by the end of the month and could downgrade its debt to junk status, blocking it from markets.</p>",
  "<p>Classical ballet celebrates pale princesses and fair swans. It's a world where dancers cake their limbs in white powder, and where performers with darker skin don't always feel welcome.</p> <p>Junor Souza is one of only two black dancers (out of 64) at <a href=\"http://www.ballet.org.uk/\" title=\"\">English National Ballet</a>, both of them male. \"Most of the time ballet dancers are white,\" he says. \"It's disappointing, and it makes me sad.&nbsp;Usually, when I go to see ballet, there is no one dark on stage.\" Nor is this dramatic imbalance limited to the UK: the picture is poor worldwide. Russia's elite <a href=\"http://www.bolshoi.ru/en/persons/ballet/\" title=\"\">Bolshoi Ballet</a> has no black dancers in its company of 218; there are very few black dancers at any of the major US and British companies. The Royal Ballet has four \u2013 three men and one woman \u2013 in a company of 96. At the <a href=\"http://www.centralschoolofballet.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Central School of Ballet</a>, which trains many future ballet stars, there are four black dancers in a student body of 110.</p> <p>Carlos Acosta, principal guest artist for <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/about/the-royal-ballet\" title=\"\">the Royal Ballet</a> and one of the world's most successful black dancers, agrees that the statistics are discouraging. \"The percentage of classical black ballet dancers around the world is sadly minimal, which is quite embarrassing,\" he says. \"In most companies, when a talented black dancer is chosen as a member, they don't know how to cast them properly. Still there is this mentality, especially with directors, that&nbsp;a black ballerina in the middle of a flock of white swans would somehow alter the harmony.\"</p> <p>While performing arts such as theatre&nbsp;and television have become increasingly diverse, progress in the world of ballet is painfully slow. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/dec/04/black-ballet-cassa-pancho\" title=\"\">Cassa Pancho</a> was a student at the Royal Academy of Dance when she set out to interview black ballerinas as part of her final dissertation. But she discovered there wasn't a single black ballerina in Britain, and so after graduating in 2001 she founded <a href=\"http://www.balletblack.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Ballet Black</a>, a company for black and Asian dancers. Over a decade later, little has changed. \"The number of black dancers is still very low,\" she says. \"In this country, there are no black British female dancers at the major companies. The Birmingham Royal Ballet has one woman, who is Canadian, via Trinidad.\"</p> <p>She worries that the lack of black ballet dancers will continue into another generation. \"If you don't see someone reflective of you, then young dancers may not even consider ballet. A lot of ballerinas go into musicals instead, because they'll be accepted there. I&nbsp;hope&nbsp;the younger generation will grow&nbsp;up without feeling ballet is not for&nbsp;them.\"</p> <p>Ballerina <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9uGWyndt3o\" title=\"\">Aesha Ash</a> joined <a href=\"http://www.nycballet.com/\" title=\"\">New York City Ballet</a> when she was 18 and danced there for eight years, until 2003. She then became a soloist at <a href=\"http://www.bejart.ch/fr/\" title=\"\">B\u00e9jart Ballet</a> in Switzerland, and later danced at <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Alonzo King's Lines Ballet in San Francisco</a>. Now in her mid-30s and freelance, Ash&nbsp;blames traditionalism for the resistance to black dancers: \"I have a strong sense that, behind the scenes, donors are saying that they don't want to see African Americans promoted in ballet. They want to see Giselles as pale,&nbsp;they want things to remain how they are \u2013 for the 'pure' swans to look like the traditional swans they've seen their whole lives.\"</p> <p>It's a mindset Souza recognises. \"I'm not going to say everyone is racist, but there is a little bit of racism. If I go to Swan Lake, there is never a black dancer&nbsp;as the swan. I think people would ask why they would put a black woman as a white swan.\" Ballet Black dancer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/dec/04/black-ballet-cassa-pancho\" title=\"\">Cira Robinson</a> believes her skin colour would affect the amount of work she was offered by a classical company (she has yet to dance for one). \"I would consider myself a darker brown,\" she says, \"but when you are lighter brown you are still dark. It's unfortunate that this is still an issue.\"</p> <p>There are so few black dancers, in fact, that ballet shoes are not made for&nbsp;dancers with dark skin. Robinson colours her shoes by hand. \"You just buy a cheap bottle of brown make-up to&nbsp;match your skin colour and dye the fabric.\" Wigs and tights are all designed for white dancers, as&nbsp;Pancho points out:&nbsp;\"Black dancers look terrible in pink&nbsp;tights, but so many companies try&nbsp;to make all the dancers wear the same tights. In Swan Lake, dancers are&nbsp;supposed to dust themselves with white powder.\"</p> <p>In an industry that struggles to accept black dancers, the successful few can feel isolated. \"You're always scrutinising your image and standing in front of the mirror,\" says Ash. \"As a young girl, you always want to fit in, and it was very difficult because no dancers looked like me \u2013 not even close.\" Souza also admits to being insecure as a young dancer. \"Now my director really pushes me and encourages me to take new roles. But when I was younger and I came on stage, I could hear the audience gasp. I&nbsp;wasn't sure if it was because they liked&nbsp;me or because I'm a black guy in a white costume.\"</p> <p>While most companies will hire a non-white dancer, there are very few that will employ more than a handful. Christopher McDaniel, a dancer at <a href=\"http://losangelesballet.org/\" title=\"\">Los Angeles Ballet</a>, believes unofficial quotas affect job offers. \"I've done a few auditions, and companies are initially interested because they needed one or two black dancers in the company. But once the spots get filled, the attention is no longer there. I have felt that some companies will accept you because they need one black dancer to look better in the public eye.\"</p> <p>For dancers in traditional companies, casting opportunities are often limited. \"I'm lucky to have directors who cast me on ability,\" says McDaniel. \"But a lot of black men are cast in full-mask roles, like the Mouse King or the wolf in Sleeping Beauty. It's also common for black men to be cast in aggressive parts.\" Ash has encountered similar prejudice. \"Black women are often perceived as rude, ostentatious and aggressive. In ballet, the meek, humble,&nbsp;innocent young girl roles are rarely given to black women. But we are&nbsp;all those things and then some. We don't always have to be exotic \u2013 all fire, athleticism. The images we don't see of&nbsp;black women as princesses: that speaks volumes.\"</p> <p>Asked about its ratio of black and white dancers, a spokeswoman for English National Ballet, where Souza dances, said the company employs dancers from a range of backgrounds. \"We take new dancers every year, and find the best talents from across the world. We currently have dancers from 20 different countries, incorporating seven different ethnic groups.\" At the Central School of Ballet, director Sara Matthews says: \"The school has a programme to recruit new dance talent, and we are particularly active in areas that don't normally have access to dance opportunities. We're proud of the diversity of our student body \u2013 every one of them a talented dancer with enormous potential.\" Last October, <a href=\"http://www.centralschoolofballet.co.uk/news.php?Year=2012&amp;Month=01\" title=\"\">CSB launched a satellite school</a> in Southwark, south London, which provides free weekly ballet classes to more than 100 children aged seven to 11.</p> <p>While this is a positive step, the fact remains that, until dance moves beyond its traditional limitations, the artform risks becoming truly outdated, leaving audiences and performers behind. \"It requires brave and bold leaders,\" says Acosta, \"to represent the world as it is today on the stage.\" Still, not everyone is so pessimistic. \"I would love to see a black dancer play a Sugar Plum Fairy,\" says Ballet Black's Robinson. \"And I&nbsp;think it will happen.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 September 2012. The original quoted Cassa Pancho as saying, about the lack of black British female dancers at the major companies: \"The Royal Ballet has one woman, from Kenya.\" Although that is true, the words Cassa Pancho used were: \"The Birmingham Royal Ballet has one woman, who is Canadian, via Trinidad.\"</p>"
