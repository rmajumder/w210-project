  "<p>The most famous white suit in the world, a classic example of the finest 1970s polyester tailoring, has been tracked down by the Victoria and Albert Museum after an international search.</p> <p>The three-piece suit was as much a star of the 1977 film Saturday Night Fever as John Travolta who played Tony Manero, or the Bee Gees, who provided the soundtrack for the story of a young man who disco-dances his way out of the ghetto.</p> <p>Bought off the peg in a cheap men's clothes store in Brooklyn, the suit was last seen in public 17 years ago, when it was sold at a Christie's auction to an anonymous bidder for $145,000 (\u00a393,000), three times the top estimate. The curators of this autumn/winter's<a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/exhibitions/exhibition-hollywood-costume/\" title=\"\"> exhibition on Hollywood costume </a>were determined to find it and put out an international appeal. To their surprise it has turned up in London, in immaculate condition, and the owner has agreed to lend it to the museum.</p> <p>The owner, who wishes to remain anonymous but has let slip his age, is not a collector. He said: \"I was nine years old when Saturday Night Fever came out and before seeing the film I had already fallen in love with the legendary soundtrack.</p> <p>\"The ritual of [Travolta's character] choosing his clothes to go out at night, in a world of his own and disconnected from the reality of his life, particularly resonated with me. It was the first film I really loved, and in essence it was part of my own rite of passage \u2026 When I saw the suit on sale, I wanted to buy it because of what it represented to me personally.\"</p> <p>Professor Deborah Nadoolman Landis, a designer and historian of film costume \u2013 her own credits include Michael Jackson's Thriller video and Raiders of the Lost Ark \u2013 is senior curator of the exhibition. She said: \"Saturday Night Fever was actually a very dark little movie, and this suit, made of completely gross polyester, was the shining light, the symbol of aspiration and hope that shone in the film in that heart-stopping moment when it all comes together, the music, the lights, the suit, and Travolta dances in it.</p> <p>\"It took me totally by surprise. I fell completely in love with him, as everyone who sees the movie does.\"</p> <p>The broad lapels, tight waistcoat and high-waisted flared trousers \u2013 a 71cm (28in) waist which Travolta could never get into these days \u2013 have been endlessly imitated. But there is no doubt that this is the genuine article. The curators have already been to inspect it, and found conclusive proof in the actor's handwriting.</p> <p>It was first auctioned in 1978 for charity, when <a href=\"http://www.cmgww.com/stars/siskel/collector/index.htm\" title=\"\">the American critic Gene Siskel</a>, who listed Saturday Night Fever as one of his favourite films of all time, paid $2,000. The actor signed it and the inscription is still faintly visible in the lining: \"So here's to a classic, your friend, John Travolta.\"</p> <p>Originally the character of Tony Manero was to strut in a black suit, but white was the inspired choice of the film's costume designer, Patrizia Von Brandenstein. \"Heroes from Sir Lancelot to Tom Mix wore white in the great contests to express purity and single-minded devotion to the task at hand. So for me, white was the only choice for the suit.\"</p> <p>She went shopping in Brooklyn where the character lived, with the director John Badham, and Travolta \u2013 who was then starring in a hit television series, Welcome Back, Kotter. As word spread that he was in the neighbourhood, screaming mobs descended on the small clothes shop where he was trying on the suit, beating on the windows and pleading with him to come out.</p> <p>Nadoolman Landis said buying it off the peg was a piece of genius: \"Even in a low-budget movie like Saturday Night Fever, they could have found the money to make Tony a suit \u2013 but the fact that it was bought from an ordinary shop that anyone could go into gave it a great truth, exactly the sort of garment somebody from his background would see and long to own.\"</p> <p>Brandenstein actually bought several suits, two to dance in, and two that had to be turned up at the hem for Travolta's much shorter stunt double. The other suit worn by Travolta was stolen from an exhibition in the US, so Nadoolman Landis had almost abandoned hope of including the item in the V&amp;A show, which includes costumes worn by characters including Pirates of the Caribbean's Jack Sparrow, Holly Golightly from Breakfast at Tiffany's and Darth Vader.</p> <p>\"The costumes in this exhibition are so powerful that each has its own soundtrack which the visitor will hear in their heads \u2013 but even in this company the white suit is special,\"\u2211 \"It is the Turin shroud, the closest an ordinary mortal can come to the body of the actor.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 Hollywood Costume, Victoria and Albert Museum, London, October 2012 to January 2013 </em></p>",
  "<p>The prospect of London's black cabs going electric has come a step closer with the unveiling of a prototype that will be trialled on the capital's streets as early as next year.</p> <p>Nissan has promised that its new London taxi, a van-like vehicle, can eliminate 20% of the capital's exhaust pollution caused by its 22,000 black cabs. But the carmaker warned that it was now down to politicians to make electric traffic a practical reality.</p> <p>The London mayor, Boris Johnson, has pledged that a zero-emission taxi fleet will be in service by 2020, although London assembly members have queried the slow rate of installing charging points for electric vehicles.</p> <p>The NV200 taxi will also be produced in a diesel engine version that Nissan claims is 50% more fuel-efficient than existing cabs. The vehicle retains the distinguishing features of London cabs \u2013 the for-hire light and the 25-foot turning circle reportedly required to drive to the Savoy hotel's front door \u2013 but also has aesthetically questionable tinted sunroofs and sliding doors.</p> <p>The taxis, expected to be on general sale to cabbies by 2014, will be built in Barcelona but the electric versions will have the batteries and motors produced in Sunderland.</p> <p>Andy Palmer, executive vice-president of Nissan, said the vehicles had a potential range of 200 miles a day, based on an overnight charge and a 30-minute fast charge at one of the anticipated future network of charging points.</p> <p>While Nissan is also adapting the same model for Tokyo and for New York's yellow fleet, it held out the prospect of London's hackney carriages winning the race for a fully electric future.</p> <p>Palmer said: \"The ball was in the manufacturers' court. Now it's with the cities to see who can get the infrastructure in place.</p> <p>\"Charging is the big question. This needs collaboration with government and the authorities to get the range you need.</p> <p>\"The ENV200 will have a range of 200 miles but that relies on having chargers in the right place. There's a lot of work to be done.\"</p> <p>Despite the possible public perception that London's cabbies may not be the most ardent environmentalists, taxi drivers' representatives were enthusiastic about an electric fleet, and not just because Nissan has promised to price its vehicle below those built by rivals the London Taxi Company and Mercedes.</p> <p>Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association, said: \"People think 'Ah, cabbies, they don't care', but we sit in traffic all day. We sit in more pollution than anyone.\"</p> <p>He said the lack of noise from electric vehicles was the \"real competitive edge\" for drivers. \"They're so quiet, it's so much more relaxing.\"</p> <p>However, he cautioned against anticipating a transformed experience: \"I can't promise you cheerful cabbies or interesting banter. But it can't happen soon enough.\"</p>",
  "<p>Eat, work, watch the Olympics, sleep: that's pretty much been my routine has been for the past 10 days \u2013 along, I suspect, with 60 million others across Britain. But there's one crucial difference. On Tuesday morning, I will be competing in the London 2012's men's triathlon.</p> <p>I really can't wait. Watching the glut of British medals has been amazing and uplifting \u2013 and training, first at altitude at San Moritz and then in Yorkshire, has gone brilliantly. Everything is in place. Now myself, my brother Alistair and Stuart Hayes, the third member of the British team, just have to show what we can do.</p> <p>Al and I enter the race as favourites, but that doesn't faze us. He has won 12 of the 15 world series races he's entered since 2009, while I've finished in the top three in my last 13 races at elite level \u2013 winning six of them \u2013 so while people talk about pressure, it won't affect us. A race is a race whether it's in Madrid, San Diego or London. There is always pressure to do well. And controlling nerves, like winning, is a skill.</p> <p>It might surprise some people, but we've not practised on the Hyde Park course since we've been in London. We've swum in a local leisure centre not the Serpentine, and zipping around it on the bike doesn't appeal either with all that traffic. But we've competed on the course twice before, so we know what to expect. The bike, for instance, has a little hill going from Hyde Park to Buckingham Palace, but it's only a 2% incline, and the real challenge comes from handling the corners. We also knew that the bend where several riders crashed in the women's race on Saturday was tricky.</p> <p>You might also be surprised that we've not talked detailed tactics yet. We'll wait to see what the weather is like on Tuesday morning first. If the water in the Serpentine is below 20C it will be a wetsuit swim which changes things slightly, for instance, and if there are significant downpours we might alter our approach too. But we've won in blistering sun, heavy rain and even a hailstorm, so the British weather doesn't scare us!</p> <p>But I'm happy to tell you what our general approach will be during the race. It can be summed up in four words: we will be aggressive. We will go off hard in the 1500m swim and try to be in the top five out of the water to set ourselves up on the bike. We will then try to engineer a breakaway on the 43km bike ride so that when it comes to the run there are only a handful of athletes with a chance of a medal.</p> <p>You have to flexible, mind, because things often don't always as you expect. People look at us, and maybe they are scared of what we can do. They know we can run faster than most too, so it wouldn't be a surprise if someone tried a breakaway on the bike. Having Stuart in the team as a domestique will help us respond to any challenges or difficulties. Al picked up a puncture while winning the European championships last year, for instance, so you have to be able to think on your feet.</p> <p>We haven't tried to change too much beforehand. People think that because it's the Olympics, you have to train super hard, but if you push too much you'll be absolutely shattered. Yes our training has been hard, but it's also been controlled and we've tapered over the past week to ensure we are spot on.</p> <p>I always eat pizza the night before a race, because wherever you go in the world pizza is pretty much the same and the chances of your body reacting negatively to it are slim. Breakfast will be toast or cereal, and I'll finish it by 7am to allow my body to digest it before the 11am start.</p> <p>And then it will be time to race in front of a crowd of thousands of people cheering us on in Hyde Park. I know most people don't follow the triathlon world series format, which sends us around the world from Sydney to San Diego, but the Olympic triathlon race is easy to understand: you swim 1500m, bike 43km, run 10km and in the end somebody wins.</p> <p>It will be tough to beat Al, who usually gets the better of me when we race, but it's not impossible. I am going to give it my all.</p> <h2>Three keys to victory</h2> <p>1) Don't think of the race as anything special. Yes, it's the Olympics but it's a normal swim-bike-run.</p> <p>2) Swim fast, get a good clean start, and then everything will fall into place.</p> <p>3) Find a way to beat my brother!</p>"
