  "<p>There goes the last remnant of a better era. Farming minister <a href=\"http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/17/10/2012/135768/DEFRA-consults-over-Wages-Board-abolition.htm\" title=\"\">David Heath announced the abolition of the Agricultural Wages Board</a>, the last of the old wages councils. There are just four weeks of \"consultation\" before farm workers lose this special protection. The rest of the wages councils were eviscerated by Margaret Thatcher and axed by John Major in 1993, ending an era when governments saw endemic low pay as their concern.</p> <p>In the old days, the sectors with workers at most risk of exploitation had their own wages councils, with representatives of employers and workers fixing pay and conditions, mindful of what an industry could bear. Hairdressing, catering, retail, laundry and tailoring had some of the lowest-paid and most vulnerable workers. Wages councils were founded in 1909, the year of the Liberal government's radical People's Budget, with its unprecedented taxes on the wealthy. What a sad paradox that, in their first return to government since Lloyd George, Heath, a Liberal Democrat, is killing off the last wages council.</p> <p>His press release is headed: \"Getting rid of outdated labour restrictions will mean more jobs.\" These days certain killer words flash out instant red alerts: \"reform\", \"flexible\", \"harmonise\" and \"modernise\" all signify their opposites. Heath's \"plans to modernise the agricultural labour market\" mean taking farm workers back in time. His plan for them to be \"harmonised with the rest of the economy\" won't feel harmonious when it \"leads to a more flexible labour market\" to \"end an anomaly requiring farmers to follow outdated and bureaucratic rules\".</p> <p>Farm work is not noted for good pay and conditions. It is still one of the most dangerous occupations with a high accident rate. Isolated, under-unionised, with little choice of other work, a third of agricultural workers live in tied housing, exceptionally vulnerable to the whims of employers. That's why their wages council was allowed to survive when the others were scrapped. Their current minimum pay, which is legally enforced, is just 2p an hour above the national minimum. But the board also sets sick pay, holiday pay and a graded pay progression, important when so many work on small farms with little chance of promotion. The board ordains other conditions, such as warm clothing, essential for outdoor work. It sets a pay rate and age for child pickers, who will lose all protection from now on. (Nine-year-olds were discovered picking spring onions from dawn till dusk in freezing weather in Worcestershire last year.) The board sets fair rents for tied housing \u2013 \u00a328 a week for a caravan \u2013 but there will be no rent limits from now on.</p> <p>Richard Neville, a union member, drives a tractor on a Sussex farm. His farm-working parents were veterans of the last battle in 1976 over security in tied housing. \"Wages are bound to fall back. The board fixes overtime rates at time and a half: we'll lose that, though sometimes we're doing 20 or 30 extra hours a week. There's a lot of poverty in these rural areas, because costs are high, but people don't see it.\" Labour's <a href=\"http://www.marycreagh.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Mary Creagh</a>, shadow environment secretary, is fighting to save the board. \"Those who pick the apples should be able to afford to buy them,\" she says, watching the rise in rural poverty: \"The most picturesque market towns now have food banks.\" One chance of reprieve comes from the Welsh assembly, which claims they have the right to prevent the board's abolition in Wales \u2013 though Defra denies that's within its powers: lawyers are at work on both sides.</p> <p>Heath is right on this: the idea of a statutory board with legal enforcement officers, ordering employers to provide footwear and clothing to their workers, giving them three days' extra holiday, better sick leave on full pay and graded pay rates, does seem an oddly outdated anomaly. In a free market, why would the state intervene? Back in the 1970s workers' pay, rights and conditions were the stuff of politics. In those fractious times, unions' struggle to keep members' pay from falling far behind sky-rocketing inflation led to head-on confrontation with governments trying to hold inflation down. As the prices and incomes board strove to arbitrate, the net result was pay scales that made this country more equal than it had ever been in history \u2013 or will be again on the present trajectory. But all that was blown away spectacularly in the 1980s, as boardrooms turned kleptocrat. Within a few years the number of poor children shot up from one in seven to one in three, where it has stayed \u2013 and it will now worsen.</p> <p>This week ONS figures reveal that real living standards have fallen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/23/uk-wellbeing-fails-to-recover-financial-crisis\" title=\"\">by more than 13% since 2008</a> \u2013 but that virtually meaningless average hides a gigantic difference between high and low earners, as useful as averaging Zimbabwe and Manhattan. Resolution Foundation figures show that the incomes of the bottom half of households have stagnated ever since 2003: without change, stagnation is the new norm and recovery won't help. At \u00a36.19, the real value of the national minimum wage has fallen back to 2004 levels. Everything this government does conspires to depress low incomes further, with cuts in credits and housing benefit as wages still fall behind high food and fuel inflation.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/14/statutory-london-living-wage-ed-miliband\" title=\"\">Labour contemplates the living wage</a>, currently set at \u00a37.20. Labour councils urge public and private employers to sign up. It's a great gesture when organisations do sign up, but it costs little for banks, local councils, KPMG or anyone else employing few minimum-wage staff. So far no large employer of the low-paid has signed up: no hotel, care home or catering chain, no supermarket, cleaning company or security guard provider. Voluntaryism isn't enough.</p> <p>Labour should use its fight to save the Agricultural Wages Board to think again about the old wages councils. Bringing in the minimum wage was one of Labour's best achievements \u2013 but a single rate across all industries will always be a lowest common denominator, rising only at the pace of the most precarious sector. Market conditions in hairdressing, sandwich-making and care homes are unconnected. A fair rate set for each industry would help to keep wages up, avoiding the risk that the minimum wage is the norm, not a rock-bottom backstop. Wages councils could restore some of the best spirit of the postwar settlement, when the state did intervene on pay.</p>",

If you liked Kurt Wagner's near-whisper of a voice and the way it crooned gently over that Nashville outfit's subtle evocations of early-70s US country and soul, you'll love what this Virginia musician and producer together with his Spacebomb House Band achieves on his debut album.</p> <p>Big Inner is soulful in a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/jun/19/bon-iver-bon-iver-second-album-review\" title=\"\">second Bon Iver album</a> or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/mar/30/new-band-gayngs\" title=\"\">Gayngs</a> way. Via a sequence of hushed, meditative songs it communicates a calm spirituality as well as a deep love of the dexterously intermingled soul, funk and country you would have heard 40 years ago on an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/oct/17/popandrock10\" title=\"\">Al Green</a> or Curtis Mayfield record. Fully expect in these songs \u2013 which reference love, mortality and god and have an almost holy reverence for the beautiful, intricate instrumental performance \u2013 the kind of \"licks\" they used to describe as \"tasty\" and the sort of ensemble approach adopted by the Philly, Stax or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jul/17/bob-babbitt-motown-funk-brothers-dies\" title=\"\">Motown house bands</a>.

He means it, man.</p> <p>White, a 29-year-old from Virginia who also operates as a jazz arranger, spent four years in the Philippines during his youth with his evangelical Christian/missionary parents. He talks with missionary zeal about the healing power of music in the face of life's travails. He is especially passionate about the work done by his band and the auxiliary brass and string musicians and choir who all came to his Richmond attic to recreate the golden age of country-funk-soul. We were almost fooled into thinking there was an ironic inflection to his voice and the delivery of these inch-perfect versions (we nearly said \"pastiches\") of said era, but further investigation revealed that this is life-or-death stuff for White. There is even a moving but uplifting track on the album called Gone Away, written on the night his young cousin died. These are songs of faith and redemption that are born out of tragedy but with a determination to provide spiritual uplift: Big Love (\"Moving on like any other man should / Moving on like any other man would\") has a typically positive message, although he does find time for more earthly pursuits. Will You Love Me finds White coming on like his namesake <a href=\"http://www.lyricstime.com/barry-white-love-serenade-lyrics.html\" title=\"\">Barry</a> (\"Baby, you're magnificent / Child, you're intelligent / Honey, you can pay the rent with that smile on your face\"). The songs move at a uniformly Steady Pace (as one of the titles here has it), and the whole thing would work superbly on a soundtrack for a sequel to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Jackie-Brown-Music-Motion-Picture/dp/B000002NJM\" title=\"\">Jackie Brown</a>.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Rich baritone \u2026 driving chamber pop arrangement(s)\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://consequenceofsound.net/2012/07/new-music-matthew-e-white-big-love/\" title=\"\">Consequence of Sound</a>.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Matthew E White gets next to you.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Be grittily sweet.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/soul-singer-al-green-is-attacked-in-his-own-bathtub\" title=\"\">Have hot grits poured on him by an angry ex-lover</a>.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> Big Inner will be released via Hometapes and Spacebomb on 21 January 2013.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Lambchop, Bon Iver, Curtis Mayfield, Allen Toussaint.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://matthewewhite.tumblr.com\" title=\"\">matthewewhite.tumblr.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>Friday's new band:</strong> Lowell.</p>",

  "<p>You could say <a href=\"http://peterfetterman.com/artists/pentti-sammallahti/\" title=\"\">Pentti Sammallahti</a> was <a href=\"http://www.valokuvataiteenmuseo.fi/en/component/content/article/10321\" title=\"\">born for photography</a>. His grandmother, Hildur Larsson, was an accomplished Swedish photographer for the Helsinki newspaper Kaiku in the 1900s. He grew up surrounded by her images. His father took him, aged nine, to the famous <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/learn/resources/archives/archives_highlights_06_1955\" title=\"\">Family of Man</a> group exhibition, curated by <a href=\"http://www.atgetphotography.com/The-Photographers/Edward-Steichen.html\" title=\"\">Edward Steichen</a>, when it came to Helsinki in 1959. From that moment, the young Sammallahti knew what he wanted to do with his life.</p> <p>At 11, he made his first photographs \u2013 small contact prints of everyday life in Helsinki. In 1964, he joined the <a href=\"http://www.kameraseura.fi/english/history-of-the-helsinki-camera-club/\" title=\"\">Helsinki Camera Club</a> and blossomed. He had his first solo show in 1971, aged 20. The earliest photograph in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1907893261/dewilewispublish\" title=\"\">Here, Far Away</a>, a beautiful retrospective book of his work just published in Britain, dates from 1964, when he was 14. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/gallery/2012/oct/25/photography#/?picture=398335241&amp;index=7\" title=\"\">A man sleeps in a doorway, oblivious to the bird that pecks at the earth in the foreground</a>. It is an almost austere image, formally accomplished and understated in its arrangement of vertical and horizontal lines: the doorframe, the wood panels, the bricked pavement. But there is an odd melancholic poetry too, not least in the two stark white lines someone has painted on the doorframe, one of which seems to rise, dreamlike, out of the sleeping man's outstretched palm. Above the bird, on the wall, someone has chalked a neat love heart with an arrow though it. Even at 14, Sammallahti's eye was drawn to the quiet illumination of everyday life. As he grew older, his <a href=\"http://www.candacedwan.com/#New_York/Artists/Pentti_Sammallahti\" title=\"\">vision deepened and widened, becoming both more poetic and more austere</a>.</p> <p>The book is divided into nine chapters, <a href=\"http://www.photoeye.com/gallery/forms2/homepage.cfm?image=1&amp;id=68149&amp;imagePosition=1&amp;Door=1&amp;Portfolio=Portfolio7&amp;Gallery=1\" title=\"\">each a record of Sammallahti's restless wanderings</a> through Finland, Norway, Britain, eastern Europe, Africa, China and India. His first published portfolio, a limited edition of 200 signed silver gelatin prints in a box, featured images taken in the west of Ireland in 1978. It was dedicated to Paul Strand, but his photographs of rural Ireland, as well as those taken in Hungary and Romania, have more in common with <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP=XSpecific_MAG.PhotographerDetail_VPage&amp;l1=0&amp;pid=2K7O3R135R3G&amp;nm=Josef%20Koudelka\" title=\"\">Josef Koudelka's images of similar people and places</a>. Sammallahti's gaze, though, is warmer, more intimate and, at times, more epic. A landscape in Erd\u0151b\u00e9nye, Hungary, taken in 1979, looks like a monochrome still from a beautiful film, or a landscape painting drained of colour. There is something both old-fashioned and timeless about it. <a href=\"http://prod-images.exhibit-e.com/templates_exhibit-e_com/Erdobenye_Hungary_19790.jpg\" title=\"\">A horse-drawn carriage transports two farmers and several stacks of hay.</a> The wet road sweeps off into a misty backdrop, where two faraway steeples are divided by a telegraph pole rising out of tall grasses, silver-grey in the muted light.

Here, the blankness of the landscape, shading into grey forests or skies, is an atmosphere in itself. Wolfish dogs and solitary birds feature in many of the images, survivors in a harsh, beautiful environment where everything \u2013 rivers, lakes, skies and bare trees \u2013 seems frozen into stillness. He also captures the changing of the seasons \u2013 snow giving way to mud, a different kind of grey making the landscape an entirely different world.</p> <p>For all that, Sammallahti's vision is also a lyrical one. He often captures humans and animals in worlds of their own, lost in reverie: dogs chase birds, birds cautiously approach humans or circle above them. Often, his camera captures a single figure in a dreamlike landscape: <a href=\"http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lo2s0znz2U1qhqfw3o1_r1_500.jpg\" title=\"\">a man walking down a road in a silent, snow-covered world at dusk, his dog waiting</a>, patient but alert, ahead of him. You can almost hear the crunch of snow underfoot. But what is most palpable is the silence of the surroundings.
