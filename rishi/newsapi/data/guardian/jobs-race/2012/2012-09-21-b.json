  "<p>The battle is on for France's opposition party to find a successor to Nicolas Sarkozy to unite the divided right and return it to power.</p> <p>The centre-right UMP party is looking for a charismatic leader who can rally support after losing its 17-year hold on the presidency to Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in May.</p> <p>Several former ministers had suggested they would stand as party general secretary, but after weeks of speculation the field was reduced to just two when the deadline for nominations closed last week.</p> <p>Now the former prime minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, 58, and his younger rival Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9, 48, the current party chief, will go head to head for the job.</p> <p>The two men claim to be natural successors to Sarkozy, with whom both had an uneasy, at times hostile, relationship in recent years.</p> <p>Fillon, a discreet and serious character whose wife is Welsh, is seen as an experienced, safe pair of hands. He was appointed PM in 2007 after helping Sarkozy win his presidential election bid.</p> <p>Defying frequent reports that he was to be replaced in a reshuffle, Fillon remained at Matignon (the prime minister's official residence) throughout Sarkozy's five-year term in office.</p> <p>Cop\u00e9, once sidelined by Sarkozy as a potential rival, was brought back to his inner circle as head of the UMP in 2010. Unashamedly ambitious and seen as more charismatic and hyperactive than his rival, he is presenting himself as Sarkozy Mark II, telling supporters he will \"walk in the footsteps\" of the former president.</p> <p>\"France needs someone who is going to jump in and get their hands dirty,\" he said recently. He added he would step down if Sarkozy decided to return to mainline politics.</p> <p>Fillon said he too would remain close to Sarkozy: \"I cannot imagine leading the party he helped to develop without his support,\" Fillon told the daily Le Parisien.</p> <p>In a swipe at Cop\u00e9 he added: \"The truth is that Sarkozyism is a bit like love; there are those who speak a lot about it because they have reason to do so. Their love is fairly recent, while there are others who over the years can prove their love.\"</p> <p>Both are keen to play up links to Sarkozy after an opinion poll by LH2 published on Tuesday found that 43% of rightwing voters think Sarkozy would have the best chance of regaining the presidency for the UMP party in 2017, ahead of Fillon, with 32%, and Cope, with 21%.</p> <p>However, polls give Fillon a considerable lead over Cop\u00e9, which the younger candidate will hope to close in the coming weeks.</p> <p>In policy terms, less divides Fillon and Cop\u00e9, who have similar views on economics and Europe. Both support tighter budget discipline and reforms to lower employment charges.</p> <p>Last week, there was a brief spat between both camps over the number of supporters each had among card-carrying UMP members.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Cop\u00e9 announced with great fanfare that he had amassed 30,000 signatures. Within hours the Fillon camp responded by announcing its candidate had at least 45,000. A member of Cop\u00e9's team said the news had fallen on the candidate like \"a thump on the head\".</p> <p>The only woman who had been seriously in the running, former environment minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, who was Sarkozy's spokesperson during his election campaign,was in third position but stood down at the last minute.</p> <p>\"Many of our supporters were hoping for a third way so the election didn't end up being a duel between Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9 and Fran\u00e7ois Fillon,\" she told French journalists. \"It's not necessarily such a good image for our party,\" she added.</p> <p>NKM, as she is known, refused to say who she would support.</p> <p>The candidates will officially begin their campaigns on 5 October and party members will vote on a new leader on 18 November.</p> <p>Cop\u00e9 will publish his campaign programme on 3 October, entitled Manifesto for an Uninhibited Right. \"Those who read it will see what I have in my heart,\" he said, adding that it contained some \"suggestions to shock\".</p> <p>The highlight of the campaign will be a televised debate. Cop\u00e9 has welcomed the chance to go face-to-face live with his rival, but Fillon's camp has been more cautious.</p> <p>\"A debate in the same political family is always a little complicated,\" said Fillon's campaign director Eric Ciotti.</p>",
  "<p>If you're a headteacher whose school is being forced to make the switch to sponsored academy status, you probably assume that all staff jobs are covered by <a href=\"http://www.cipd.co.uk/hr-resources/factsheets/transfer-of-undertakings-tupe.aspx\" title=\"\">Tupe</a>, legislation that guarantees the terms and conditions of existing employees. But when you meet the broker employed by the Department for Education to discuss the transfer, you may be in for a shock.</p> <p>\"We're being told directly by heads that DfE brokers are saying Tupe legislation doesn't apply to them, that a different job of principal would be created in the new academy, and that it would be advertised nationally,\" says Rob Kelsall, senior regional officer at the <a href=\"http://www.naht.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Association for Head Teachers</a> (NAHT).</p> <p>\"We've got heads who have been terrified not only by the thought of academy conversion being forced on their school but also that they do not feature in the future of that school.\"</p> <p>In one meeting between the headteacher of a primary in the north of England and DfE brokers, the senior leadership team was given advice that the NAHT says is unlawful and could lead to expensive industrial tribunals.</p> <p>In minutes of the meeting seen by the Guardian, the DfE broker explains that it's up to the sponsor to decide whether a headteacher is transferred as principal to the new academy. The rationale is that the role of principal is so different to that of headteacher that advertising the job is justified, should the sponsor choose to go down this route.</p> <p>Interestingly, it is also suggested by the DfE broker that it may not be in the best financial interests of a head to transfer to the academy. As a new principal, he or she would be rigorously performance-monitored and if it were subsequently decided that the person wasn't up to scratch in the new position, a compromise agreement with accompanying financial package pre-Tupe transfer would not be offered.</p> <p>This is not an isolated instance. Kelsall says that several headteachers have raised the same concern. His colleague, Ian Coupe, based in the west of England, explains that with one head he is advising, the DfE broker has \"virtually come in and said 'You don't have a job'.\"</p> <p>DfE brokers may be advising heads that their jobs are on the line, but it seems that academy sponsors \u2013 the employers of new academy staff \u2013 interpret Tupe legislation in an interesting variety of ways.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.harrisfederation.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Harris Federation</a>, which from this month has 19 academy schools, says it works by the principle that Tupe legislation applies to all staff including the headteacher. So far, however, all but two of the heads in local authority schools which transferred under Harris sponsorship, have automatically become principals. The exceptions are a new free school and a head who resigned before the switch.</p> <p>But other sponsors take a different view. At <a href=\"http://www.oasiscommunitylearning.org/\" title=\"\">Oasis Community Learning</a>, which has 14 academies, spokesman Gary Streeter confirms that Oasis does require headteachers \"to reapply for their jobs\", unlike all other staff who are automatically transferred across.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.arkschools.org/\" title=\"\">Ark Schools</a>, with 11 academies, spokeswoman Lesley Smith says that heads \"have precisely the same rights [under Tupe as other staff],\" but then goes on to say, \"but there tends to be a conversation, particularly with the senior leadership team as the role changes\".</p> <p>Most worrying for heads is the response from <a href=\"http://www.e-act.org.uk/\" title=\"\">E-ACT</a>, a not-for-profit company that runs 27 academies and two free schools. Christine Lynch, its head of human resources, says that \"from a statutory point of view, in the transfer of any employee, the transferees carrying on the same business are Tupe-transferred.\"</p> <p>However she continues by saying: \"Where we'd have areas of variation around that is where we'd be saying to our academy principals that they come as new appointees. So our view on this is it's not quite the same in the case of the principal.\"</p> <p>Lynch suggests that the role of principal in a new academy is sufficiently different from that of headteacher and that it may require a different skillset . This means that when E-ACT sponsors a new academy, it advertises the role of principal, and \"we do go through a very rigorous selection process.\"</p> <p>Although Lynch says that in the three years that E-ACT has been running academies, all headteachers bar one (who did not reapply for the role of principal) have been transferred across, the NAHT's Kelsall says this misses the point completely.</p> <p>\"From our perspective,\" he says, \"we're seeing this as people trying to find a way round the legislation.\"</p> <p>Kelsall notes that <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/tupe\" title=\"\">guidance</a> on the BIS (<a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Department for Business, Innovation and Skills</a>) website says: \"The new employer cannot pick and choose which employees to take on. It follows that they cannot terminate contracts and dismiss employees just because the transfer has occurred.\"</p> <p>So are headteachers protected under Tupe or aren't they? Unfortunately for anyone involved, it seems that the department for education and business are contradicting each other.</p> <p>In an attempt to clarify matters, the NAHT's lawyers have written to the Department for Education to explain that Tupe applies to every member of staff including heads. They say that their understanding of the law means that, \"even where an economic, technical or organisational reason entailing changes to the workforce exists, dismissal may still be considered unfair, and in the rare circumstances where there is a substantial change of role during conversion, the employer still has a duty to take reasonable steps to avoid redundancy and operate a fair selection process.\"</p> <p>But the DfE seems to be keeping its options open. In a statement to the Guardian, it says: \"Headteachers are able to retain their existing terms and conditions when they transfer to the same role in an academy. Some academies advertise for an academy principal, which is a different role with a much broader remit. Headteachers may chose to apply for this position.\"</p> <p>It hardly offers unqualified reassurance that all headteachers will be protected. Until the two Whitehall departments sort out who's right on Tupe, it seems that heads who are told they must transfer to a sponsored academy will still have to wonder if the knock on the door from a DfE broker means that their job is for the chop.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 September 2012. The original stated that E-Act runs 15 academies when it actually runs 27 academies and two free schools.</p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>An Israeli government minister has sought to defuse accusations that Binyamin Netanyahu is attempting to influence the outcome of the US presidential election, saying Israel's official policy is \"to stay as far away as possible\" from its ally's domestic politics.</p> <p>Danny Ayalon, Israel's deputy foreign minister and a former ambassador to the US, told a conference in New York that Israel \"makes no distinctions\" between Democrats and Republicans. \"Israel has no better friend than the US and no better friend than President Obama in the international community,\" he said, according to a report in Haaretz.</p> <p>Footage of Netanyahu <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/20/netanyahu-us-political-ad-obama\" title=\"\">featured in a political advertisement</a> broadcast in the swing state of Florida. The ad was produced by Secure America Now, a hawkish non-profit organisation, without the consent of the Israeli prime minister's office.</p> <p>Ayalon told the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organisations that he wanted to set the record straight in case there was any \"misreading\" of Israel's intentions. The current \"noise\" over US-Israel relations was a result of \"not very well judiciously planned remarks from both sides\" being misconstrued. On the issue of Iran, Israel and the US \"see eye to eye\", Ayalon said.</p> <p>Relations between the US and Israel have been severely strained in recent weeks over the issue of how to deal with Iran's nuclear programme. Netanyahu has publicly demanded that the US sets clear \"red lines\" beyond which it would take military action to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities. The US has declined to do so.</p> <p>After a press conference at which Netanyahu said that without red lines there could be no \"red light\" to unilateral military action by Israel, he and Obama spent an hour on the phone in an attempt to repair the breach. But officials in Jerusalem subsequently claimed that the White House had rejected a request for a face-to-face meeting when Netanyahu visits the US next week. US officials denied this version of events.</p> <p>Obama's opponent in the election, Mitt Romney, has adopted a significantly more hawkish stance on Iran. Netanyahu's warm relationship with Romney contrasts with the froideur between him and Obama.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Israeli foreign ministry said he could not confirm the veracity of Ayalon's remarks.</p>",

  "<p>James Murdoch is reportedly being lined up to run News Corporation's Fox TV business in the US despite being sharply criticised by British broadcasting regulator Ofcom on Thursday.</p> <p>The role being discussed would put him in charge of the Fox Networks Group, which includes the Fox terrestrial TV network as well as cable channels such as FX and National Geographic, says a report in the Financial Times.</p> <p>Murdoch had hoped the promotion, which would return him to pole position to take over from his father and to run the TV business when News Corp demerges it from its newspapers next year, would have been announced in July.</p> <p>Sources told the FT that the new role had been formalised but Rupert Murdoch resisted the announcement.</p> <p>Another source cited said that News Corp could not countenance announcing the expanded role in July until there was a better idea about what would happen in London, where potentially damaging Ofcom and Leveson inquiry reports were still on the horizon.</p> <p>On Thursday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/20/sky-broadcast-james-murdoch-criticised\" title=\"\">Ofcom declared BSkyB \"fit and proper\" to own broadcast licences, but the regulator was highly critical of James Murdoch's</a> handling of the phone-hacking scandal.</p> <p>It found that Murdoch's conduct in relation to News Group Newspapers \"repeatedly fell short of the conduct to be expected of a chief executive and chairman\" and that his lack of action in relation to phone hacking was \"difficult to comprehend and ill-judged\".</p> <p>If Murdoch ascends to the new role, there would be a new reporting structure at News Corp with Peter Rice, the Los Angeles-based head of News Corp's lucrative Fox Networks, reporting directly to him.</p> <p>Rice was promoted to this role in July and Murdoch had hoped his father would rubber stamp the deal then.</p> <p>The move gave Rice control of all programming of the Fox Networks Group, including Fox Sports, Fox International and National Geographic channels. However, Fox News, run by Roger Ailes, remains a separate business.</p> <p>In London, the phone-hacking scandal and its fallout will continue to cast a shadow over News International for some time. Lord Justice Leveson's final report on the future of press regulation is still to come, there are several hundred more civil damages cases to settle next year, and the Metropolitan police investigations into alleged criminality at the publisher and any resulting prosecutions could continue for up to three more years.</p> <p>Tensions are running high at Murdoch's favourite paper, the Sun, over the mounting number of arrests of journalists. On Thursday afternoon, the chief executive of News International, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/20/news-international-sun-journalist-arrest\" title=\"\">Tom Mockridge, called an unexpected staff meeting to try to boost morale</a>.</p> <p>The meeting was called after the third Sun journalist in two days was arrested in relation to Operation Elveden, the Met police inquiry into alleged payments to police and other officials for stories, and to Operation Tuleta, the police investigation into alleged computer hacking which was recently widened to include alleged criminal breaches of privacy.</p> <p>In all, 21 journalists at the Sun have now been arrested.</p> <p>According to one staff member who was at the meeting, Mockridge is very uneasy about the continuing role of the management and standards committee, the internal inquiry unit that set up by News Corp to clear Wapping of all alleged criminal practices.</p> <p>Mockridge told Sun staff that he had \"no date\" for when the arrests would end and said the company continued to co-operate with the Metropolitan police, as agreed by parent company News Corp.</p> <p>He said it was up to News Corp, not News International, to decide when to end co-operation with the police.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
