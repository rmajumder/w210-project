I was in Atlanta, Georgia that day and I remember the line snaking right round the school where the polling station was set up; on and on it went. This year I truly didn't expect to see anything nearly as impressive, what with the mood of the country being so sour and the economy still so sluggish. But I've just seen one of the longest lines I've ever seen at the polling station in downtown Cleveland. It was so long it went round the block and around another block. I walked all the way along it and counted my steps \u2013 400 full paces of voters queuing up dutifully in the cold to cast their ballot. You'd have to be pretty cynical not to find that impressive.</p> <p>The line is 90% African American, I'd say, and every one of the people I spoke to were intending to vote for Barack Obama. This is Souls to the Polls day when black churches encourage their congregation from all over the city to come to the polling station and vote. I've come down here with a black church from the suburbs, God's Tabernacle of Faith. Pastor Thomas Eppinger finished his Sunday service, then piled his congregants into two vans and brought them to the polling station.</p> <p>It takes some determination on a cold day like this to join the very back of the queue. But that is what Barbara Dixon, 39, had just done when I spoke to her just now. She said she was happy to wait \"as long as it takes because I want to make sure this election is won by a president who has values that I care about\". She's got at least two hours to go before she gets to the voting booth, but really she didn't seem at all bothered.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-dd51ea76-1ff1-4d58-8dfd-c591cc8ca906\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/4/1352064233397/-460.jpeg\" alt=\"voters queue in Cleveland, Ohio\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People in Cleveland, Ohio, waited in long queues to cast early votes.

The Republican-controlled Florida legislature cut back early voting days from 14 to 8. That included scrapping voting today, the final Sunday before election day, when large numbers of African Americans traditionally went to the polls after church.

Saturday night was bitterly cold in Bristow, Virginia, but that didn\u2019t stop thousands coming to a rally addressed by the two best orators their party has produced since Robert Kennedy. \u201cIt\u2019s once in a lifetime,\u201d Jennifer Rodriguez, a nurse who\u2019d made the journey from Richmond, told me.</p> <p>Of course Bill Clinton has to play the support act these days, but he does so with huge heart. He bounded on stage in brown leather bomber jacket, wrapped up far less warmly than his audience, and delivered what was largely a reprise of his Charlotte showstopper, when he wowed the Democratic convention with a masterclass in substantive rhetoric, patiently laying out the policy-based reasons why the American people should re-elect their president. His voice was so hoarse, you wondered if it would give out. But the crowd stayed with him, lapping up the unarguable simplicity of lines such as \u201c\u2019We\u2019re all in this together\u2019 is better than \u2018you\u2019re on your own.\u2019\u201d And he can still work a rally like the most seasoned Catskills comic. Of Mitt Romney\u2019s multiple positions on the auto-bailout, Clinton said: \"He\u2019s tied himself up in so many knots, he could be hired as the chief contortionist of Cirque du Soleil.\u201d</p> <p>There were two moments of almost imperceptible tension. One came early, when Clinton confessed himself \u201cmore excited\u201d about supporting Barack Obama \u201ceven than I was four years ago.\u201d It brought a fleeting reminder that in early 2008, Bill Clinton was devoting all his red-faced energy to dismissing the Obama candidacy as a \u201cfairytale.\u201d Later the former president spoke of the ailment known as Romnesia, the habit of forgetting the Republican\u2019s past record. I\u2019m pretty sure I heard him add, as an aside, that \u201cHis opponent may even have got a bit of it.\u201d That sounded like a reference to Obama himself, an apparent dig at the president\u2019s failure, especially in the first debate, to nail Romney\u2019s many contradictions.</p> <p>If that's what it was, few noticed it. Instead, the crowd cheered for Obama when he come on to high-five and hug his predecessor - and cheered louder as he delivered a strong, confident and, at times, stirring performance. He lavished praise on Clinton, saying his team \u201ccalls him the Secretary of Explaining Stuff\u201d. He added that \u201cthe only person working harder than he is is Hillary.\u201d</p> <p>When the speeches were over, the two men worked the ropeline together to the sound of Clinton\u2019s old anthem, Don\u2019t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow. Yesterday the Clintons were Obama\u2019s foes. Today they are two of his most useful friends.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4904d4d3-5714-4a5d-998e-7e76eee714bb\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/4/1352038483183/f647848e-9104-48a6-b46d-7885295c6730-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Bill Clinton and Barack Obama in Virginia\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Clinton and Barack Obama at their joint appearance in Bristow, Virginia, on Saturday night.

  "<p>The race is on. The polls are in. We have a frontrunner in trouble. A muscular challenger making hay. Gaffes. Melt-downs. Campaign coffers swollen with cash. The only question is: can the voters learn to love a sandcastle humper? I refer, of course, to the race for the Academy Award for best actor. You didn't know it was already underway? Where have you been? You've got better elections to be obsessing over? </p> <p>While everyone's attention was diverted by the small matter of who gets to lead the free world, Hollywood has begun the five-month-long jamboree that now constitutes the run-up to the Academy Awards. </p> <p>Here's what you need to know: everyone has decided Jennifer Lawrence is going to win best actress. Joaquin Phoenix was the front-runner for best actor until a few weeks ago, <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Joaquin-Phoenix-Calls-Oscars-Bullshit-Shouldn-t-Surprise-Us-33666.html\">when he called the Oscars \"bullshit\"</a>. </p> <p>Then everyone had a freak-out on Twitter over Daniel Day-Lewis' accent, as revealed in the Lincoln trailer. Everyone loves Alan Arkin. Oh, and Argo is going to win best picture. <a href=\"http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121010/REVIEWS/121019999/1023\">Roger Ebert says so</a>. </p> <p>Such is the received wisdom of the Oscarologists, that strange mole-like race of people who live underground for most of the year, emerge blinking out of the ground in early September to attend film festivals, pore over trailers and teasers, sift the soil through their fingers, sniff the air and type things like \"I smell trouble\" on their blogs. <a href=\"http://www.goldderby.com/cms/view/213/\">Here is how the race for best picture looks to them</a>[click for graph], as of last week.</p> <p>The keen-eyed amongst you will notice two things: 1) Silver Linings Playbook's spell as frontrunner bore a suspicious resemblance to \"the length of time it was playing at film festivals\" snd 2) Argo's turn in the spotlight bears a suspicious resemblance to \"the number of weeks it has been in general release.\" </p> <p>Those of you who object on the grounds that Silver Linings Playbook hasn't been released yet, and furthermore you have zero idea what it even is, need to toughen up. Awards season is not for pussies. By the end of it, we'll have you calling next year's race, blind, on the basis of which agent got the biggest shout-out at this year's ceremony.</p> <p>The tracks of the best actor race are roughly set. This year it looks like a three way race between Joaquin Phoenix, Denzel Washington and Daniel Day-Lewis. Thus far, Phoenix has been dominating the conversation with his electrifying jumble of method voodoo and chemically-induced jibber-jabber in The Master, although he damaged his chances considerably by giving an interview in which he called the Oscars \"bullshit. I think it's total, utter bullshit, and I don't want to be a part of it. I don't believe in it.\" </p> <p>Actors have gotten away with this sort of thing in the past \u2014 Dustin Hoffman called the Academy Awards \"<a href=\"http://www.alternativereel.com/cult_movies/display_article.php?id=0000000004\">a beauty contest</a>\" while George C Scott, nominated in 1970 for Patton, called the ceremonies \"<a href=\"http://www.alternativereel.com/cult_movies/display_article.php?id=0000000004\">a two-hour meat parade</a>\" but that was then. Such comments don't go sit well in the world of $15m Oscar campaigns.</p> <p>And the performance? Phoenix's portrait of a man in a state of acute spiritual undress is right up the Academy's street. They certainly like their meat gamey: see Halle Berry's win in 2000 for Monster's Ball, or Natalie Portman's 2010 win for Black Swan. Although it's also a curiously opaque, depthless performance, raising more questions about the intentions of the director Paul Thomas Anderson than it does Phoenix's character. <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/movies/2012/09/paul-thomas-anderson-the-master.html\">As Richard Brody put it</a>, \"It's not a work of psychological realism,\" one reason, perhaps, why the film has failed to catch on the box office. Is it too nuts even for the Academy? As one of the commentators at Hollywood Elsewhere put it, referring to a scene in which Phoenix makes out with a beach, \"Oscar doesn't generally go for sandcastle humping.\"</p> <p>This could well turn out to be the question of the season.</p> <p>Well, do they or don't they? Phoenix's main competition couldn't be more dignified or draped in gravitas \u2014 and twice decorated already. Given his track record at bringing American period to life, I wasn't sure Daniel Day-Lewis was going to find much fresh turf in Spielberg's Lincoln \u2013 between his Hawkeye, Bill the Butcher and Daniel Plainview, haven't we already seen his Abraham Lincoln? \u2013 but Day-Lewis tacks in the complete opposite direction to come up with a soft miracle: stoop-shouldered, spindly of frame, his Abe Lincoln is slightly weary, sagacious soul, but ramrod straight, driving the entire two-hour-and-twnety-minutes of Spielberg's epic as surely as an ox. </p> <p>Ordinarily I would say: no contest. One of our greatest screen actors, playing one of America's greatest presidents. No humped sandcastles, just nations rebuilt with blood, sweat and oratory. Call it a night and go home early. The only question hanging over the performance is whether the Academy are quite ready to usher Day-Lewis into the hallowed company of three-time winners that include the likes of Hepburn, Streep and Nicholson. Put it like that, and the prospect seems irresistible. The Academy are whores for \"greatness\" and love to make their own history. Or would they prefer to bestow that honor on Denzel Washington?</p> <p>He's landed one of the meatiest roles of his career in Robert Zemeckis's Flight (released last week), playing Whip Whitaker, the substance-abusing pilot who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/15/flight-first-look-review\">lands a malfunctioning plane while high as a kite</a>. </p> <p>It's by far the best star performance of the year, which is not to downplay it. As <a href=\" http://www.vulture.com/2012/11/movie-review-flight.html\">David Edelstein said </a>of Washington:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He's not an actor who opens himself up \u2013 you never quite feel you know him, underneath. But that's why his onscreen explorations of control and its opposite feel so right, so true to who he is as a performer and a man. When you watch Joaquin Phoenix in The Master, you see the Method at its most perilous and wobbly: you see an actor who has lost control as an actor and with it the ability to shape his performance. Phoenix is vivid but he's all over the place: if he played Whip, he'd be dissolving in the first shot, randomly zigging and zagging in the ether. But Washington takes Whip to another level. Despite the script's overfamiliar beats (yes, there are twelve-step meetings), he anatomizes Whip's existential seesaw. He breaks Whip's \u2013 and his own \u2013 cool into pieces, the good and the bad, the supremely potent and pathetically impotent. This is a titanic performance.</p> </blockquote> <p>My own feeling is that it's too good for the Oscars. Like Brad Pitt's performance in Moneyball last year, Washington's work in Flight has the kind of sanded ergonomic beauty that sails right past the grimacing and gurning required by the Academy to reassure them they are in the presence of \"great acting.\" </p> <p>Washington's major impact on this year's race could be to draw enough votes away from Day-Lewis to allow Phoenix to slip through - but right now, it feels like Day-Lewis's to lose.</p> <p><em>From now until 24 February this column will examine all the major categories in the Oscar race (best picture, best director, actor, actress, supporting actor, supporting actress) factoring in all the elements \u2013 talent, history, buzz, 'narrative', the arrangement of the tea leaves in Harvey Weinstein's morning cup of tea \u2013 that make for an Oscar win.

  "<p>Leading Republicans in a key Florida battleground have condemned Mitt Romney's campaign for writing off African American voters and attitudes toward minorities that they say have cost the party crucial support.</p> <p>Art Wood, chairman of the Republican party in Hillsborough County, a diverse area of about one million people and one of the most heavily contested regions of the state, said his party's presidential candidate failed to even try to win over black voters.</p> <p>\"Romney did a really poor job with minorities. That was my greatest disappointment. You'd go on to his website and he'd have a column for outreach. You clicked on that and there was Catholics for Romney, Democrats for Romney, fishermen for Romney. You never saw blacks or African Americans for Romney until four weeks ago,\" Wood said.</p> <p>\"I think it's the big frigging smart guys at the top who think they know how to run a campaign, and they probably just wrote off the African American vote. Romney did a really poor job with the African Americans. They're in many ways like Hispanics. They favour traditional marriage, they go to church regularly, they're suffering worse from unemployment.\"</p> <p>Wood was backed by a Republican contender for the US Congress in the area, EJ Otero, who is not even including his party affiliation on his election posters and literature because he thinks it will harm his chances.</p> <p>\"I think it's true but not only with the Romney campaign. That's a problem with the Republican party as a whole, and not just with African Americans. Hispanics, too. The Republican party has written off African Americans and Hispanics for the past 20 years and it needs to change,\" he said.</p> <p>Otero, a former air force colonel who served in Iraq and is of Cuban descent, said part of his party's problem is how it discusses issues that are important to minorities such as immigration and welfare.</p> <p>\"I do believe we've got to get off the emotional argument of: the border, the border, the border. We need to control the border so white slavery stops and narco trafficking. But when it comes to the people, we're talking about community,\" he said. \"There's also this myth that all poor people want here is handouts. They don't. All they want is the jobs they used to have.\"</p> <p>Otero acknowledged that he has distanced himself from his own party. \"I put my ideas. Nowhere in there does it say I'm a Republican. That's not helpful,\" he said.</p> <p>African American and Latino voters waiting outside the C Blythe Andrews library in Tampa to cast their ballot in early voting said Republican attitudes towards the less well off, and even \"fear\" of a Romney presidency, is driving people in the area to the polls.</p> <p>\"This is a serious election,\" said Tonya Lewis who runs a charity, Children With A Vision, to help underprivileged young people in school. \"There's been so much negativity from the Republicans. Mitt Romney scares the hell out of me. Romney can't relate to the people, he has no connection to the people. People are really afraid because if you get somebody whose worth millions of dollars, how can they know?\"</p> <p>Betty Reed, a Democratic party representative in the Florida legislature, said that turnout for early voting in the area is so high that she was arranging buses to move people to less busy polling stations.</p> <p>\"Voters in this area support the president but they're turning out to keep Romney out. His campaign played a big role. He went to the NAACP meeting and he talked about how he wanted to get rid of Planned Parenthood, things that are good for poor people. He didn't talk about what he would do for us,\" she said. \"Race is also a part of it. There's more than one issue but we know some people did not want Obama to be successful as president and we know why.\"</p> <p>Vivien Warren, who was brought from Cuba to the US as a child, was among those at the library voting for Obama. She said that the Republican-controlled Florida legislature's cutting in half of the number of days early voting, along with attempts to introduce new photo identification requirements at polling places that were struck down by a federal court as discriminatory, also drove people to vote.</p> <p>\"There's been a lot of talk among people about voter suppression. People are angry. How dare they? They're trying to prevent us from voting,\" she said.</p> <p>\"People are also angry that Romney and the Republicans have been disrespectful of the office of the president. The way Romney talked to him at the debate. People think that's about race. They don't want a black person in the White House.\"</p> <p>The legislature's removal of the last Sunday before the general election as an early voting day \u2013 a day when many African Americans went to the polls after church \u2013 mobilised religious leaders to launch a campaign, Souls to the Polls, to get black people to vote the previous Sunday instead. Vote monitors say it was successful and that turnout in minority districts will at least match that of 2008.</p>",
  "<p>Those of us who are seduced by the saccharine comforts of costume drama will have to face facts tonight, when the third series of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/sep/16/downton-abbey-review-series-three\" title=\"\">Downton Abbey</a> draws to a close. It will be months before we find out what happens next. Of course, most of us already know, somewhere in our subconscious. Either that, or we don't really care.</p> <p>For the reason we watch Downton is to seek solace in a glorious past while trying to cope with the crises of the present. The kindly Crawley family and their beloved servants settle our nerves. Their fiction reassures us, drawing us to a time when life was simple \u2013 when, give or take the odd exception, people accepted their place in society, and when our isles were homogeneous and hermetically sealed, as one <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/julian-fellowes/90418\" title=\"\">Lord Fellowes of West Stafford</a> would have us believe.</p> <p>But what if the classic costume drama were turned on its head? What if we were presented, not with the reinforcement of this untroubled past but its absences \u2013 those people and events that have been erased from hundreds of years of national myth-making? What might Sunday evenings be like then?</p> <p>To test the water, you could start by engaging in the work of two British artists, <a href=\"http://www.rivingtonplace.org/Exhibition-and-Events\" title=\"\">Kimathi Donkor</a> and <a href=\"http://www.carrollfletcher.com/artists/40-John-Akomfrah/overview/\" title=\"\">John Akomfrah</a>, whose solo exhibitions are currently on at London's Rivington Place and <a href=\"http://www.carrollfletcher.com/artists/40-John-Akomfrah/overview/\" title=\"\">Carroll/Fletcher</a> galleries. Although they work in different mediums \u2013 Donkor uses oil paints to create lavish figurative portraits whereas Akomfrah works with film, sound and photography \u2013 they share a common concern with the spectres of the past and how their presence might be felt in the present.</p> <p>In Queens of the Undead, Donkor brings us face to face with four historic female commanders from Africa and the African diaspora. Spanning four centuries, from the 17th to the 20th, these women were fighters, who either led slave rebellions or rose up against Europe's colonising armies. Yet they are little-known here. With his large paintings, Donkor disrupts our memory, showing these women, candidly, in their full glory and complexity. His vivid use of colour grabs your attention, imploring you to stop and consider.</p> <p>One of these heroic figures, Angola's 17th-century Queen Nzinga, is portrayed wearing 21st-century clothes and using a mobile phone. More disconcerting, however, is Donkor's appropriation of classical European paintings. Jamaica's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanny_of_the_Maroons\" title=\"\">Nanny of the Maroons</a>, an 18th-century folk hero and former slave, is modelled on Joshua Reynolds' 1778 portrait of Jane Fleming: the two women strike the same pose. This technique makes his work appear to be familiar, even to the amateur eye, but as you stand before it, the centrality of the black figure is unsettling. And it is precisely in this moment of realisation \u2013 that you are shocked \u2013 that his work is so effective. You find yourself querying history and reflecting on that which has disappeared from view.</p> <p>Some of Donkor's paintings show more contemporary scenes of police brutality and racism. We see the artist, naked, being hit across the face by a white policeman, and, in another scene, the body of Jean Charles de Menezes being carried by Stephen Lawrence and Joy Gardner.</p> <p>In Hauntologies, Akomfrah is less overtly political, but the politics of representation is at work here too. Exploring the components of costume drama, the artist is emphatic in his insistence on the place of Africans in western history. The catalyst for his film Peripeteia is a pair of portraits \u2013 one of a young woman, the other of a man \u2013 from the 16th century by Albrecht D\u00fcrer. They are thought to be among the earliest representations of black people in Europe. Akomfrah also draws on The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch, showing close-ups of encounters between white and black figures. \"For me this painting has always depicted a utopia,\" comments Akomfrah, \"because it suggests that the Adamic space of our emergence was multicultural!\"</p> <p>In a year in which Danny Boyle was congratulated for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2012/jul/28/olympics-2012-danny-boyle\" title=\"\">including Windrush arrivals in his Olympic opening ceremony</a>, watching Peripeteia reminded me how short-sighted a historical representation that was. Black people have been in Britain for hundreds of years, possibly thousands, and it is a sad indictment of all of us that the work of artists such as Akomfrah and Donkor still seems to be so radical, so rare and so political \u2013 while Downton's aristocratic agitprop goes largely unnoticed.</p> <p>Yet there is overlap in these works of drama. In staging history, they all invoke questions of mourning and memory, and the artists' attempt to exhume the dead. They are all encouraging us to imagine a past, one in which we might place ourselves and from which we might gain comfort. And they are all testimony to the circular nature of history, which repeats itself with such regularity. However, unlike Fellowes, Donkor and Akomfrah are encouraging us to rethink these islands along more hopeful and provocative paths.</p>",
  "<p>The UK music press was looking northward to Liverpool on Saturday night for the annual Music Of Black Origin, or Mobo, awards. Cue the now traditional debate about whether white prizewinners are desirable, whether the awards really represent black music \u2013 and whether, if they don't, that's something we should even be worried about.</p> <p>There are grounds to say that there has never been a better time to be a black musician. In 2012, black music <em>is</em> pop music: the charts are populated by rappers and soul singers and there has certainly been a change in the musical landscape since the Mobos began in 1996. In recent years artists such as Dizzee Rascal, Wiley, Chipmunk, Tinchy Stryder and Tinie Tempah have emerged from the east London grime scene of mixtapes, pirate radio and MC battles atop tower blocks and stepped into the commercial pop charts.</p> <p>Singers such as Leona Lewis, Rebecca Ferguson and Alexandra Burke have gone on from <em>The X Factor</em> to be superstars and from that same show JLS have become that rarest of things: a successful black British boy band. Surely the best black musicians have never had it so good?</p> <p>But a look back over 70 years of British black music shows that the true story is more complicated. Not for the first time in popular culture, mainstream success has come at a price.</p> <p>Black music first emerged as a force in Britain in the years after the second world war, with imports of soul and blues from America and<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/06/ronnie-gordon-jamaica-music-ska\" title=\"\"> ska and rocksteady from Jamaica and the Caribbean</a>. There was also success for the Trinidad-born British pianist Winifred Atwell \u2013 the first black person to have a UK number one, with her 1954 ragtime classic Let's Have Another Party. But it wasn't until 1969 that Desmond Dekker topped the charts with Israelites and inspired a generation of black British musicians. Then the early and mid-70s produced hits for artists such as Eddy Grant and Linda Lewis and the roots reggae of Aswad also emerged.</p> <p>Dotun Adebayo, the former music editor of the <em>Voice</em> and a BBC radio presenter, remembers that time fondly: \"If you walked down Kingsland Road or through Stoke Newington, you'd notice around 20 black record stores in that small area alone, with reggae, lover's rock, roots, soul and funk on sale \u2013 and there were studios as well.\"</p> <p>For Adebayo, the late 70s and early 80s form an alternative golden period for black British music, when a homegrown DIY aesthetic flourished, allowing artists to operate by their own rules. A time when creativity could co-exist with the major labels. A time that has come and gone.</p> <p>\"There was no better time for British black music than between 1978 and 1980,\" Adebayo says. \"It looked like we were about to take over. And we did, on a street level \u2013 but it wasn't until Jazzie B and Soul II Soul came along that things really blew up. That success changed everything.\"</p> <p>Above all, as a result, according to this school of thought, the edge became blunted. The attention that acts such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/28/massive-attack-blue-lines-remaster\" title=\"\">Massive Attack </a>and Soul II Soul created on both sides of the Atlantic, with their mix of dance music and soul and hits like Back To Life, gave other black British musicians a platform on which to build. But that success and attention also brought labels that were interested in repackaging and selling this product to as many people as possible. With that came compromise \u2013 and, for some artists, pressure to sacrifice authenticity for mainstream success.</p> <p>The lines between what was black music and what was not were blurred. Reggae, soul, R&amp;B and lover's rock were all genres that were seen as black, but in recent years such distinctions have become fuzzy to the point that black artists topping the charts are loth to describe their own output as \"black music\". And the specificity that was once attached to black music has been replaced by a manufactured concept of what it is; one that usually takes inspiration from American hip-hop and R&amp;B, and presents black music as a genre open to all performers regardless of skin colour.</p> <p>In the lead-up to Saturday night's Mobos, one of the show's star attractions, four-time nominee Labrinth, told the <em>Daily Star</em>: \"I think [the Mobo ceremony] is a bit weird because Ed Sheeran doesn't make black music, and neither does Conor Maynard \u2013 he makes commercial pop.</p> <p>\"Even I'm not making black music. It's commercial music, but at least it is more related to hip-hop so it makes more sense.\"</p> <p>Labrinth is hardly out on a limb. When Jessie J, a white singer singing mainstream pop songs that have very little to do with black music, walked away with four awards last year, even the Mobos' staunchest supporters were asking if the remit of the awards had become too mainstream, neglecting the artists the ceremony was supposed to celebrate.</p> <p>In the 15 years since the Mobos began, there has undoubtedly been an undoubted shift towards \"urban\" acts, who \u2013 unlike their predecessors \u2013 can look forward to a career rather than simply being a one-hit wonder. But have those acts had to tone down their blackness in order to get on?</p> <p>Adebayo, who is married to Carroll Thompson, the lover's rock singer, believes that there are now only certain types of black artists who will get backing from labels: \"If you come across as too black, too strong, yeah you will get a certain type of audience but labels are trying to sell to every person in the country. To reach that number of people takes a lot of promotion and they're not going to do it for someone who is only going to appeal to 16-to-25-year-old black men.</p> <p>\"Look at Tinie Tempah. Somebody knew that this kid had it. Look at him. He's got that quirky, black, preppy look with the oversized glasses. That could be anybody.\"</p> <p>Charlie Dark understands the pressures that the pop industry puts on artists to conform. He was signed to Sony as part of the hip-hop trio Attica Blues in the mid-90s and now helps young people with his <a href=\"http://www.rundemcrew.com/\" title=\"\">Run Dem Crew</a> project.</p> <p>He said: \"There's a blueprint you must follow and if you don't follow that blueprint then basically you will be ignored. You can be a black artist in your bedroom with YouTube, become successful, and sign for a major label, but you still have to adhere to the blueprint.</p> <p>\"It's frustrating for me, being old enough to have seen Soul II Soul come through and to get 30 years down the line and people are still facing similar&#xa0;problems.\"</p> <p>Above all, Dark says, the Mobos are missing out by not offering the major prizes to the newest, most innovative acts. And there are plenty of young black musicians making exciting and different music today.</p> <p>As in the 60s and 70s, much of the good stuff is again coming from overseas. Afrobeat \u2013 the largely west African mix of western rap with funk and contemporary African pop \u2013 has become a huge draw and can pack out the O2 in London with artists and DJs such as D'banj and Abrantee spreading the message.</p> <p>After the first wave of grime artists were courted by the pop world and in some cases changed beyond all recognition, a new generation of UK grime producers such as Swindle, Preditah and Royal-T, led by Elijah &amp; Skilliam and their Butterz label, have been dubbed Grime 2.0. Their focus is on the instrumental side of grime with stark synth- and bass-driven sounds offering a refuge for fans who became disillusioned by the transformation of Dizzee Rascal, Tinchy Stryder and Lethal Bizzle into pop stars.</p> <p>Dance music and electronica have always been areas where black artists have innovated. In 2012 labels such as Hyperdub have provided a platform for artists such as Ossie, Cooly G (who was Mobo-nominated) and Scratcha DVA who re-imagine the limits of garage mixing neo-soul with complex productions.</p> <p>They are not household names but the talent and freshness is there. And the Music Of Black Origin awards need to do a better job of recognising them, to recover the spirit of their own origins and purpose, according to Dark.</p> <p>\"The Mobos shouldn't be an annual event where everyone pats themselves on the back for very small advances that they've made, when they are powerful enough to bring real change. If they don't adapt, artists who aren't interested in commercial pop and being put in musical boxes will just do their own thing.\"</p>",

  "<p>How much has the extraordinary wave of hope that swept the world four years ago, when President Obama was inaugurated, been borne out by his first term in office?</p> <p>Why do I think it is so vital that he wins again this week, for America and for the world?</p> <p>Let's remember President Obama inherited a very deep hole, a hole most Americans did not imagine existed. When he came in, we had lost four million jobs in four years \u2013 800,000 jobs evaporated in January 2009 alone. Since that time, we have created five and a half million new jobs. That's more than 30 straight months of job growth in tough economic times. In addition, he had to confront banks that, through their greed, had forced record-breaking home foreclosures. The global economy \u2013 from the US to Europe and around the world \u2013 was at the point of total collapse. The banks were bailed out.</p> <p>The automotive industry had collapsed. Now, because of the Obama administration's policies to rescue the auto industry, we're the number one auto-producing nation again. Autoworkers are once more working three shifts and producing high yields. The auto industry is back, though Romney said: \"Let them go bankrupt.\"</p> <p>Furthermore, when President Obama came into office, we were caught in a war of choice \u2013 an immoral, bad choice \u2013 in Iraq. President Bush and Tony Blair dealt us a severe blow. The whole world was telling them not to wage war \u2013 I was speaking in London at Hyde Park on the day of the big <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/2765041.stm\" title=\"\">protest</a>. We told them there was no basis for going into Iraq. Since then, we have lost British and American lives, resources and honour, and they have not been humble enough to apologise. That war cost us trillions of dollars, which took us from a budget surplus to a budget deficit.</p> <p>Now we have left Iraq and the administration has implemented a plan to wind down the war in Afghanistan, which is coming to a close in terms of American involvement. Billions of dollars spent on war can now be redirected to jobs, investment and economic development at home.</p> <p>There's a lot more we must do to be seen as leading the world by right. We have become addicted to leading by might and it takes some time to restore confidence and credibility. We're not there yet but we're moving in the right direction.</p> <p>So yes, when President Obama took office, the US and the world were in a deep, dark economic (and political) hole. But now we are moving through fields towards the mountaintop. Though we've yet to reach that point, the arrows are pointing in the right direction \u2013 jobs, industry, healthcare cover all on the rise, wars on the decline.</p> <p>Romney and the conservatives have derided the comprehensive health care plan as \"Obamacare.\" But the truth is that Obama does care. People would be dead without health insurance. And young people benefit as they can stay on their parents' health plans into their 20s. The insurance companies were charging higher and higher fees for ever lower cover and they claimed the right not to insure people. Obama broke up that kind of exploitative behaviour and today 30 million more Americans are covered. Obama's historic healthcare legislation will stand the test of time.</p> <p>And all of this achieved despite the attempt by the Republicans&#xa0;to demean the president.&#xa0;They called him a liar. They said that he's not an American, he's not a Christian, he's illegitimate.</p> <p>Romney offers no positive alternative for America. We are currently in the throes of a weather crisis, hurricane Sandy, which has wreaked havoc on the east coast. Railroads, subways, roads, bridges, houses, banks, whole communities have been devastated. Romney once said we don't need Fema, the federal government agency now co-ordinating the rescue and recovery programme related to these disasters. He says \"state authorities\" (not the federal government) should handle that devastation \u2013 and private investors.</p> <p>The fact is a state alone cannot handle such problems. And&#xa0;private investors should not be profiting out of such misery. It's the role of&#xa0;central government to be a part of the emergency repair and to be a part of the clean-up and reconstruction. Because of an act of nature, there must now be a massive investment in infrastructure. It will create jobs and contracts, new technology as well as other scientific advances.</p> <p>President Obama had made the case for that before the disaster \u2013 for the need to invest in infrastructure, in roads, buildings and bridges, to reinvest in America to put Americans back to work. Now that he's leading us in this crisis, even his adversaries are saying he's doing a good job. &#xa0;The president's leadership during hurricane Sandy is steady and confident.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/18/obama-inauguration-obama-white-house\" title=\"\">I said in an article in the <em>Observer</em> four years ago that Barack Obama's inauguration</a> was a magnificent moment in a five-decades-long race for civil rights in America and in the world as a whole. Has his first term&#xa0;stood up to the extraordinary hope he inspired? For black Americans, a ceiling has been removed. An African American, a woman or a Latino can&#xa0;now believe that their path through life will carry them as far as their dreams can imagine. If Obama can do it, it inspires women to think they can do it and Latinos to think they can do it. So the barrier to our dreams has been removed.</p> <p>But you cannot have racial reconciliation unless you have racial justice. Our <a href=\"http://www.rainbowpush.org/\" title=\"\">Rainbow</a> friends in the UK call it Equanomics \u2013 racial equality and economic justice. Black people are still facing tremendous racial injustice; we're number one in home foreclosure; the banks target us. We're number one in infant mortality. Number one in short life expectancy. Number one in unemployment. We're still very much on the margins.</p> <p>A few have done well enough to become symbolic examples. You look at Colin Powell, you look at Oprah and you look at some great athletes. But you can't measure the progress of the masses of black Americans by the symbolic value of extraordinary achievers. It's like swimming the English Channel. It's not the distance that makes it difficult to swim \u2013 it's the undercurrent. That's what we're struggling against \u2013 an undercurrent based on centuries of enslavement, institutional race inequalities and unfounded fears.</p> <p>I look at America embracing&#xa0;Olympic&#xa0;medallists, black and white; embracing the impact of black music upon the culture. You'd think those achievements would have brought more reconciliation. But we seem to be cherry-picking \u2013 selectively recognising black success while still disregarding racial injustice.</p> <p>The scar on America's soul is racial injustice. It is the key to equality, workers' rights, children's rights, environmental security and ending war. So how this issue is handled is the key to the salvation of our nation. Martin Luther King would say that the pursuit of racial justice is the way to redeem the soul of America. President Obama's achievement can only be seen as part of&#xa0;a long battle for civil rights. What one must appreciate is that his ascendancy is a long journey that can be traced in modern history He did not come to us unilaterally. He came out of a 64-year process. In 1948, President Truman ended military racial segregation. The Supreme Court knocked down decades of legal segregation in the Brown v Board of Education decision. We won a big victory in 1955 with the Montgomery bus boycott, after Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white person, leading to the end of segregation by 1964. We won the <a href=\"http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/1964_civil_rights_act.htm\" title=\"\">1964 Civil Rights Act</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/intro/intro_b.php\" title=\"\">1965 Voting Rights Act, e</a>nding discrimination at elections. We staged the anti-Vietnam war protests. From 1948 to 2008, there were 60 years of victories: overcoming obstacles, removing walls, pulling down barriers. Obama comes out of that process. &#xa0;He's a result of the &#xa0;years of struggle. He is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. He ran a fast, able leg of the race we're in. He is a member of a team.</p> <p>So has the issue of race in American politics been transformed for all time? &#xa0;Absolutely not. The forces of hostility have in a strange way been reinvigorated, their fears have been revived, their anger has been rekindled, the mean spirits have resurged. America has a deep-seated commitment to unfounded racial fears and, win or lose, those fears will not go away.</p> <p>There are attempts to take the civil rights victories back. Our opponents are fighting the civil war of 1865. They're trying to pit states' rights against a more perfect union, the federal government. If Obama loses, they'll be empowered to undermine years of work. &#xa0;If Romney wins and puts right-wingers on the Supreme Court, the courts could rule to undermine the entire movement made by Dr King. Who appoints the next Supreme Court justices will determine the next 50 years of America. &#xa0;</p> <p>The scale of the president's achievement is not just a matter of his complexion, but the direction in which he has tried to take the country. He has done a huge amount, but a unified America could have achieved twice as much. Instead, the Republicans have been planning how to make him a one-term president since the time of his inauguration in January 2009. Their mission was not about job creation, bank reconstruction or to revive manufacturing. Their mission was not to rebuild. Their mission was at all costs to undermine his authority. &#xa0;</p> <p>If the president wins, conservative right-wingers will not stop fighting ideologically. &#xa0;We must maintain our struggle to prevail. We need to keep taking the nation forward by hope and never backward by fear. We need to keep hope alive.</p>"
