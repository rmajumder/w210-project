  "<p>Indhu Rubasingham arrives early at the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/tricycle-theatre\" title=\"\">Tricycle theatre</a> in Kilburn, north London \u2013 and that's as it should be because she runs it. Rubasingham has been its artistic director for three months since taking over from Nicolas Kent, who ran the theatre for 28 years. She's a welcoming, warm and wonderfully open person. She admits Kent is a daunting act to follow and yet enthuses about her new home \u2013 its exotic paint colours, its renovated bar. But we are not, as she knows, here to inspect the bar. We're here to meet Adrian Lester and his wife, Lolita Chakrabarti, and to talk about <a href=\"http://www.tricycle.co.uk/current-programme-pages/theatre/theatre-programme-main/red-velvet/\" title=\"\"><em>Red Velvet</em></a>, the play launching Rubasingham's first season. Lester is to star, and Chakrabarti wrote it. It could not be a more enticing prospect. And now here they are, pushing open the door to the Tricycle's upstairs interview room \u2013 tall, late and damp from the morning's rain. He cuts a dash and so does she (Lolita is both a writer and an actress \u2013 she first made her name as Jamila Blake in <em>The Bill</em>). Lester is dressed in black from head to toe \u2013 they're smiling, approachable and look slightly beset like the parents they are.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2001/jul/22/features.review27\" title=\"\">The last time I met Lester</a> was in 2001 when he was in his 30s and playing Hamlet in Peter Brook's production. I remember he talked almost as much then about his four-and-a-half-month-old baby daughter, Lila, as about the prince of Denmark. He was worried about not being home more (<em>Hamlet</em> and nappy-changing did not mix), and he said, with a laugh, that he was lucky to have \"an understanding wife\". Great to meet that understanding wife today, temporarily unshackled from domesticity \u2013 their daughters are now 11 and eight \u2013 and to be able to congratulate her on what is a tremendously accomplished play.</p> <p>In theory I'm interviewing three people but we would not be here without a fourth \u2013 the 19th-century African American Ira Aldridge, one of the greatest Shakespearean actors of his day and the play's subject. There's a festive atmosphere up here in the Tricycle's attic (one feels sure Rubasingham would throw a good party and that the same talent must inform her directing). And in our light-hearted way we all wish the interview could turn seance and Aldridge join us. Whatever would he be like? How would his acting strike us? \"Would his acting work?\" Chakrabarti wonders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397165167\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/10/4/1349347936544/Ira-Aldridge-painting-001.jpg\" alt=\"Ira Aldridge painting\" width=\"200\" height=\"239\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ira Aldridge as Othello, by James Northcote (1826). Photograph: Manchester Art Galleries</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manchester Art Galleries</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We know what Aldridge looked like from <a href=\"http://www.manchestergalleries.org/the-collections/about-the-collection-2/history-of-the-collection/\" title=\"\">James Northcote's 1826 portrait</a> in Manchester Art Gallery. A creamy chemise and white lace kerchief perfectly sets off his dark skin. He has finely curved eyebrows, a sensual mouth, a distinguished nose. His countenance looks as if to be alert was habitual \u2013 the sideways glance watchful. But then he was playing Othello \u2013 a stormy sky behind him. In publicity shots, Lester looks satisfactorily similar with wary eyes and white necktie. And as one of our most talented Shakespearean actors he's the man for the part (even if his career includes roles Aldridge never got a stab at \u2013 Rosalind in Cheek by Jowl's celebrated all-male <em>As You Like It</em> and non-Shakespearean triumphs such as confidence trickster Mickey Bricks in the BBC's <em>Hustle</em>).</p> <p>Rubasingham explains how the play came about: \"I directed Lolita 12 years ago at the National and we became friends. She told me she was doing a screenplay about Ira Aldridge, and I was shocked because I'd done&nbsp;a drama degree but had never heard of him. She told me, with passion, that&nbsp;we should know his story. I said, 'Don't make it a screenplay: write a play.'\"</p> <p>It's a play that \"works on many levels, which is why I wanted it as my opening at the Tricycle. It's partly about politics in theatre and what we need to do to make theatre relevant. It's about how, in spite of obstacles, talent shines through. This man \u2013 in a period when slavery still existed in America and we were debating here whether to get rid of slavery in the colonies \u2013 was on the Covent Garden stage in one of only two theatres to have a royal patent.\"</p> <p>She adds that Aldridge, who was born in New York in 1807, became the highest-paid actor in Russia. When he died on tour in Poland in 1867 he was given a state funeral. \"He's a role model,\" says Rubasingham. \"I hope young people will see the play and go, 'Wow, if he can do it\u2026 ' For we are all full of self-doubt about whether we belong: are we inside or outside?\" And she implies that she's going to need Aldridge's example as she takes on the Tricycle (coping with its \u00a3350,000 subsidy cut, for starters).</p> <p>She is a woman on a mission, believing in drawing in \"people who don't go to the theatre \u2013 it must not become a rarefied art form or we will lose the reason taxpayers fund it\". For the first time in the Tricycle's history, there is to be a Christmas show, <em>One Monkey Don't Stop No Show</em>, a reworking of the Arabian Nights. But she is not playing safe: her season also includes <em>Paper Dolls</em>, a play that resists paraphrase about five immigrant workers caring for Hasidic Jews (the carers perform cross-dressing cabaret in their spare time). Rubasingham talks with particular zest about the Tricycle's multicultural neighbourhood and her desire to \"make the world a smaller place\" through theatre. A goal you could say she shared with Aldridge.</p> <p>Chakrabarti first heard of Aldridge at a reading of Lester's in 1998 and was determined to find out more: \"I didn't know where to start \u2013 there was no internet then \u2013 but he drew me on.\" Her play is more than a portrait; it's an exploration of acting, an <em>Othello</em> masterclass. And for Lester this is fortuitous as he has been cast as Othello in Nicholas Hytner's production at the National next year. \"It's a brilliant way in,\" he says. He describes Aldridge as \"a one-man case for the abolition movement\" \u2013 as well as being a pioneer for black actors.</p> <p>In a recent newspaper interview, Rubasingham, with characteristic humour, reversed a question \u2013 about being a female, Asian&nbsp;director \u2013 to inquire as to how being white and male might be affecting the journalism of her interrogator. One can understand that there might be a limit, as she laughingly suggests, to how often she wants to be asked about her Sri Lankan parents. And yet, I put it to&nbsp;all of them, is there not a danger that treating race as a non-issue tilts the subject too far towards a homogeneity in which roots, history, individual differences mean nothing? Here we have a play about an extraordinary figure \u2013 the first to prove that being black was no bar to classical acting. Is it fair to his memory to persist in saying there is nothing to discuss?</p> <p>It's a tussle to which we are about to return. But before we do, I want to add that I was startled and amused by the play's take on journalism. When a Polish female journalist breaks into Aldridge's dressing room, he turns on her: \"You exist because I do. Without me you'd be even less than you already are.\" And so I ask the trio to name their pet-hate questions from journalists &nbsp;\u2013 the worst they have ever been asked. And the conversation takes off:</p> <p><strong>IR:</strong> My worst is: \"How does being Asian inform your directing?\" And I'll tell you why: because that is what we always get labelled with. Every interview I have ever done. I don't know what the answer is. But I came up with a good response; said because I was born in this country, I knew what it was like to straddle two cultures, and as a director the ability to be inside and outside is good. Headline: \"Culturally confused Indhu Rubasingham.\" I am not culturally confused! Journalists need to find their story but that's too easy.</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> And mine is: \"What is it like being a black actor?\" Ira had all his acting talent; his supreme skill, reduced to the colour of his skin. It bores me to death to sit in front of interviewers and have four or five questions on, say, Peter Brook and <em>Hamlet</em> and then: \"So\u2026 what is it like being black?\" I think: do you need to sell the piece this way? Why? Why not take the fact I was born on a council estate, had no contact with Shakespeare, did not go to university, got into Rada, left there at a young age\u2026 Yet the most interesting thing is: you're brown. That is a reduction.</p> <p><strong>LC: </strong>My pet-hate question is: \"What is it like being married to Adrian Lester?\" [Everyone laughs.] No, but that reduces me entirely. And it's not just journalists. People come up to me in the street and I get told: \"Oooh, you're so lucky being married to Adrian Lester.\"</p> <p><strong>KK:</strong> I'll have to cross that question off my list then\u2026 But in your play you have the line: \"I don't know how actors manage children. A lot of them do it \u2013 often, though, the parents are even more demanding than their offspring.\" How is your work/life balance?</p> <p><strong>LC:</strong> I wrote those lines and laughed my head off. This is a mad career to have children in \u2013 unstable, unpredictable.</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> At least no more nappies now\u2026 Yet working together has strained us, because normally when Lolita is working I catch the weight of what's going on at home. But if we're both on call it's trickier. We couldn't have done this when the children were younger.</p> <p><strong>LC:</strong> Our eldest has just started secondary school so is going through her own change. It's pretty full-on. You couldn't sustain it but for short bursts like this.</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> We don't have a rule about talking about work at home but sometimes we say: let's stop now, close the door, check on the kids, watch something light.</p> <p><strong>IRLC:</strong> If I'm worried about a line, I'll be worrying from a structure point of view. I don't tell Adrian as he will worry from an acting point of view.</p> <p><strong>KK:</strong> Do we know what Ira Aldridge's acting style was like? Are you trying to play him in a dated way?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> The style then was to be beautiful. It was all gesture: you retained an elegance even in the most painful moments. Indhu wants us to take on a style relevant to a modern audience, but at the same time be stylistically true to what would have been created then. So it's really, really easy!</p> <p><strong>KK: </strong>The scene in which Charles Kean, son of the legendary actor Edmund Kean, is being racist is particularly brilliant but excruciating\u2026</p> <p><strong>LC:</strong> I didn't think of it as writing about racism. I thought of different people in a room. I thought of Ira, the only black Shakespearean of the time, entering this hallowed hall: what would that be like?</p> <p><strong>AL: </strong>When intelligent people have racist thoughts they intellectualise feelings. The basis may be: you are different, I don't like you, and you're taking something which should be mine \u2013 but they add an intellectual spin. It becomes an argument about theatre and art.</p> <p><strong>KK:</strong> Ira's courage was extraordinary \u2013 to withstand such prejudice. What takes courage in your lives?</p> <p><strong>AL: </strong><em>As You Like It</em>, the first night \u2013 fear and worry. I had to have the courage to let go and do it honestly, but this is tiny compared to what Ira did\u2026</p> <p><strong>LC:</strong> I don't want to get complacent so I constantly challenge. I write, act and have started producing. It sounds far too much. But I'm going to write a film\u2026 You need courage to keep pushing.</p> <p><strong>IR:</strong> This job as artistic director has already tested my mettle and forced me to take a deep breath\u2026</p> <p>And this sounds like a cue for us to part company. Extraordinarily, later on the same day that we meet there is news that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/sep/26/painting-ira-aldridge-garage\" title=\"\">a rare unsigned 1820s painting of Ira Aldridge</a>, wearing piratical scarlet (in an as yet unidentifiable play) has turned up in a Birmingham garage. The other actors in the painting look feeble, white and flabbergasted. The man's spirit is surfacing. Rubasingham, Lester and Chakrabarti had better not hang around. They have only days now in which to bring Aldridge back on&nbsp;stage.</p>",
  "<p>In architecture, says Alexander Brodsky, \"you want on the one hand to build something that lasts for ever. But then you can have the problem of building something that disturbs you for the rest of your life. It's not good enough, but it stays.\"</p> <p>It's refreshing to hear an architect admit that he might make mistakes and also question the value of permanence, but then Brodsky is not a normal architect. He didn't design his first building until 2000, more than two decades after he left architecture school. He is now 57, and his practice is still small, mostly designing interiors and private houses around Moscow.</p> <p>When I meet him he is visiting London to install his first British exhibition, called White Room/Black Room, at the <a href=\"http://www.calvert22.org/e/exhibition-programme/\" title=\"\">Calvert 22 gallery</a> in Shoreditch. He's sleeping in the gallery, and he says he has to limit his travelling because his staff \"are always angry when I leave\". He confesses to a degree of computer illiteracy and doesn't have a website, but despite lacking the trappings of a major modern practice he nonetheless gets called Russia's greatest living architect.</p> <p>The main basis of his fame isn't built work but imaginary projects and sculptures and installations that might be called architectural art. An artist was what he wanted to be as a child, and when he graduated as an architect during the Brezhnev era he wasn't interested in working for \"one of the big state institutions\" which were the only likely sources of employment. So he started dreaming up \"paper architecture\", imaginary projects, in collaboration with the artist Ilya Utkin.</p> <p>\"I was very lucky\", he says. \"Somehow I could do what I wanted to do and even survive doing these things.\" It was \"quite illegal to sell art during Soviet times, but in the 80s we won some international conceptual competitions\". The prize money from these helped him to eat. Even after the fall of communism he continued to make art rather than buildings.</p> <p>Brodsky's work includes <em>Coma</em>, a model of a city partly submerged in crude oil, and other musings on endangered grandeur. Piranesi's imaginary drawings and views of ruins are influences, and he likes to use hollowed-out classical forms such as rotundas and porticos.</p> <p>He likes to create powerful spatial experiences, and in the Calvert 22 show he has created a very bright room next to a very dark, shrine-like space whose combined effect is in the contrast. There is also a large model of an imagined factory with a base carpeted with debris. \"I love old factories,\" says Brodsky, by way of explanation, and he once lived in one in New York. This one could be American or Russian, and it has the crumbling, abandoned look you might find in either country, but it's not a portrait of any one building. It is rather a fiction or an archetype, something that stands for all the mid-century industrial semi-wrecks you might have seen.</p> <p>The model's material is unfired clay, \"which is a favourite of mine. It is very fragile, and fragility is an important quality for me. It may become dust at&#xa0;any moment, but if you don't touch&#xa0;it it stays for ever.\" Here Brodsky's suspicion of permanence resurfaces; it also expresses itself in a bar made of ice on a lake. If he dislikes bad buildings that outstay their welcome, he is attracted to the idea that something \"is good enough, but you can let it go\".</p> <p>It's possible, though he doesn't especially encourage this line of speculation, that his interest in the fragile and short-lived has something to do with his home city of Moscow, where successive regimes have thrown up monuments that outlive their creators. They then become symbols of the city \u2013 Stalin's skyscrapers, for example, mean something to \"young people who hardly know who Stalin was\". These monuments are subject to erasure \u2013 the communists removed churches and monasteries, and now historic works that are inconvenient to&#xa0;developers are disappearing. Whatever seems solid and eternal is apt to disappear.</p> <p>In general, Brodsky resists attempts to see his work as critical commentaries on the extreme political climates through which he has lived. In Soviet times, \"everything was somehow connected to politics, but I tried to avoid these things. Of course I didn't like what was going on, but in my art I never touched it. I just followed my fantasies.\" Later he adds: \"the most important thing for me is independence.\"</p> <p>According to Clementine Cecil, now director of Save Britain's Heritage, but also an enthusiast for Russian architecture, Brodsky is a \"romantic\". He is \"heartfelt, direct, not pretentious\" and someone who \"brings out the best in people\". The writer and architect Beatrice Galilee has said that Brodsky has \"no notion of building according to conventions\", and his unusual career path gives him a freedom from stylistic allegiance that conventional architects find difficult. There is a whiff of postmodernism about his work, but really it belongs to no movement. He is able to pick up and play with any material \u2013 plastic bags, ice, oil \u2013 that comes to hand. One of his most charming works, to judge by the images of it, was a small vodka bar made of wooden frames taken from abandoned warehouses.</p> <p>Described in words, Brodsky's works can sound naive, but their physical realisation makes them interesting. He likes working with his hands. \"I was always drawing,\" he says. \"Drawing is the really important part of architecture, but a lot of architects never take the pencil and draw. It's a very personal thing \u2013 it is the entrance for me to some kind of world of the imagination.\" He used to love the process of making etchings \u2013 \"a miracle thing that gives space and depth on a flat piece of paper; after you press the copper plate you get really deep space and a lot of strange mysteries, things you cannot predict\".</p> <p>The physical, the tactile, the bodily, the material, also memory and dream: these are things you don't see much of in the globalised, computerised, abstracted architecture now marching through most major cities of the world. Moscow especially. Brodsky is a reminder of alternative values.</p>"
