  "<p>The dews are heavier in the garden, the mists gather in the valleys, and there is a morning freshness which tells us the sad news that summer is&#xa0;passing. Even if we were blind to nature's signs, we would know it to be so from the newspapers and commentators. The&#xa0;August silly season stories (my favourite this year was a news item about wireless transmitters being installed on hairy ants from Yorkshire) give way as they always do, to the press's September pre-conference bombardments on the political parties and their leaders.</p> <p>All party dissidents, minor or not, suddenly find themselves welcome on&#xa0;every front page and in every news studio. Opinion pollsters, out of business during the dead days of summer, suddenly find themselves able to&#xa0;use a late August poll to predict the outcome of an election still three years away. I remember one in 1995, two years from&#xa0;the election in which the Liberal Democrats doubled their seats, which had me losing my seat in Yeovil. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/charleskennedy\" title=\"\">Charles Kennedy</a> was told the same in 2003, two years before he led us to our greatest ever score of elected MPs.</p> <p>Even the normally scrupulous Martin Kettle, writing in Thursday's Guardian, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/29/lib-dems-ruthless-nick-clegg-loser\" title=\"\">preferred to suggest Armageddon for us</a> in the next election using a mid-holiday poll showing us at 10%, rather than Tuesday's poll in his own newspaper <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/27/george-osborne-liability-tories-poll-reveals\" title=\"\">giving us 15%</a>; no comment on the fact&#xa0;that this was precisely in line with our average between 1997 and 2001, before returning 52 seats in parliament. When you have a point to make, any fact&#xa0;will do.</p> <p>Liberal Democrats have long ago learned to ignore the polls and get on with the job in hand. I should know. I am the only political leader in modern British history who has presided over an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/19/liberal-democrat-polls-party-future\" title=\"\">opinion poll rating represented by an asterisk</a> \u2013 denoting that no detectable support could be found for us anywhere in the land!</p> <p>We will be judged at the next election by one fact and one fact only. Whether we have had the mettle to stay the course in delivering effective government for our country at a time of crisis. That is the only thing that matters. All the rest is the froth.</p> <p>History has not dealt the Liberal Democrats the easiest of&#xa0;hands. It does not help that we are trying to prove that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberal-conservative-coalition\" title=\"\">coalition government</a> works in such difficult circumstances. Or that those with whom we have to work are not (to say the least) natural bedfellows. These things make life more difficult. But they do not lessen the need to see it through \u2013 or the consequences for us if we fail to&#xa0;do so.</p> <p>We face an existential choice both for&#xa0;our country and our party. Britain is&#xa0;confronting the severest economic crisis for half a century at a time when everyone else is in crisis too. When our major trading partners in Europe are facing economic meltdown. When the traditional foundations of wealth and how we make our way in the world are changing. When conflict and instability seem a growing contagion. And when the whole structure of world power is changing. In these circumstances, who can be surprised that the attractions of easy solutions are more seductive than tough ones, or that popularity is hard to&#xa0;come by.</p> <p>As it is for our country, so also for our&#xa0;party. When we all overwhelmingly supported Nick Clegg's decision to lead&#xa0;us into government, we knew it would be difficult. We also knew that we&#xa0;were embarked on a course that would change our party as well as our country. Nick challenged us to leave our&#xa0;comfort zone and make the change from a party of perpetual opposition to one capable of carrying the burdens of government.</p> <p>Without Nick, that decision would never&#xa0;have been made, and the historic opportunity to show who we really are would never have existed. It is the job of our leader to take us into government. I&#xa0;failed; Nick has succeeded.</p> <p>In my view he has led our party in government, not flawlessly of course, but with a skill no one else in British politics could have matched and a grace under fire that should make us proud. If you want to see how successful he has been, just listen to the complaints from the Tory right.</p> <p>Of course, now there are plenty of easier courses on offer. In tough times there are always petty ambitions to be&#xa0;aired, the kind suggestions of our enemies to be ignored, and helpful comments from the sidelines to be endured. But there are mighty things to be done in the next year. Getting growth out of hard times; ensuring that even in austerity Britain can remain a fair society; limiting the powers of the state to snoop into our lives; protecting our fundamental rights from attack in the name of security; asserting our independence as we run up to the next election; and preparing the way for the partnerships and policies that will be necessary afterwards.</p> <p>None of this will be achieved by being distracted by mid-term summer polls, passing newspaper comments, or short-term personal manoeuvring. The right thing for Liberal Democrats to do now is to continue to do what we have done so well so far. Concentrate on the job we set our hands to under Clegg's leadership. Nothing else.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was corrected on 31 August 2012; 2003, not 2001, was two years before Charles Kennedy led the Liberal Democrats to their greatest ever score of elected MPs</p>",
  "<p>'All right, mate?\" chirrups <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/steviewonder\" title=\"\">Stevie Wonder</a> in a mockney accent<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_rVzBt20N0\" title=\"\"> last tried by Dick Van Dyke</a>. He is tired, hardly surprising given it is 2.30am where he lives in California, but that doesn't stop him from acting his usual playful self. Nor does it prevent him from talking at length about his 50-year career, and the events that shaped it.</p> <p>He's not one to hold back. Before long, he is vividly <a href=\"http://www.steviewonder.org.uk/bio/life-stories/1973_accident_images/1973Crash-Newspaper.jpg\" title=\"\">remembering the car crash </a>in which he nearly lost his life. It was 1973, and the sedan in which he was travelling careened into a truck. His wounds were severe.</p> <p>\"It was on 6 August that I almost died in that car accident,\" he recalls. It was a key date for another reason. \"It was also on 6 August \u2013 1988 \u2013 that my son Kwame was born. Life is funny.\"</p> <p>Does the crash remain the signal event of his life?</p> <p>\"It is significant,\" he replies, and it's a typical Wonder response, \"but I was blessed to come out of it. God gave me life to continue to do things that I would never have done.\"</p> <p>Principal among these was the electrification of modern soul that he effected on his extraordinary series of 70s albums. They have exerted a tremendous influence on musicians, from Michael Jackson and Prince in the 80s to rapper Drake and this year's most lauded new R&amp;B star, Frank Ocean.</p> <p>\"Yeah, I like Frank,\" says Wonder, who sang the hook from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M37VucWh06Y\" title=\"\">Ocean's No Church In The Wild</a> to the Odd Future sensation when he met him at a party recently. The feeling is mutual: reviews of Ocean's 2012 album, Channel Orange, drew comparisons with Wonder's music at its most expansive.&#xa0; &#xa0;</p> <p>After being consigned to MOR-soul hell following the likes of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwOU3bnuU0k\" title=\"\">I Just Called To Say I Loved You</a>, Wonder \u2013 who next week headlines Bestival \u2013 is hip again. Is there anybody who doesn't like him?</p> <p>\"Heh,\" he chuckles, then pauses. \"Well, there are those. But we don't like to think about that.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>No, Wonder-haters are few. Maybe he's thinking of his early days. In <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Where-Did-Our-Love-Go/dp/0711995117\" title=\"\">Where Did Our Love Go?</a>, a history of Motown, Nelson George noted the jealousy among staffers towards the <a href=\"http://www.steviewonder.org.uk/discography/albums/12year_old_genius/12year_old_genius.html\" title=\"\">12-year-old-genius</a>, even if detractors were soon silenced by his fabulous run of mainly self-penned hits: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14hskyBXkPo\" title=\"\">Uptight (Everything's Alright)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vxVyaYuGYE\" title=\"\">For Once In My Life</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnykC_Hjd7Y\" title=\"\">My Cherie Amour</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS2nfeN4DEw\" title=\"\">Signed, Sealed, Delivered</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395439184\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346348389740/Wonder-in-the-early-60s.-010.jpg\" alt=\"Wonder in the early 60s.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wonder in the early 60s. Photograph: David Redfern</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Redfern</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1971, he released the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/jun/11/marvin-gaye-whats-going-on\" title=\"\">transitional Where I'm Coming From</a>, which along with Marvin Gaye's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzPA-FrVu3I\" title=\"\">What's Going On</a> was the first serious album from a label accustomed to singles. It was a brave departure from the Motown sound, with forays into psychedelia, baroque pop and folk-inflected soul.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"I had fun doing that album with [ex-wife] Syreeta,\" he says. \"Berry [Gordy, Motown boss] said: 'Do your thing.'\"</p> <p>He recalls writing the song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIFVh_5cfmw\" title=\"\">If You Really Love Me</a> at the apartment of Laura Nyro, no stranger herself to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/apr/02/popandrock\" title=\"\">startling chord sequence</a>. Fellow Motown songwriter Smokey Robinson, however, was unimpressed with his new direction after he saw Wonder on comedian <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMmkYoiVkhE\" title=\"\">Flip Wilson's TV show</a>.</p> <p>\"I got a call from Smokey and he says: 'I didn't like your choice of material. I think it's really ridiculous.' I said: 'I don't give a \"uh\" what you think, or what anyone thinks!' That was my growing-up moment at Motown.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Hooking up with Malcolm Cecil and Robert Margouleff of electronic duo <a href=\"http://www.tontosexpandingheadband.com\" title=\"\">Tonto's Expanding Headband</a>, Wonder pursued a radical synthesised context for his new soul vision. His purple streak continued with 1972's Music of My Mind and Talking Book, 1973's Innervisions, 1974's Fulfillingness' First Finale, culminating in 1976's double-LP (plus additional EP) treasure trove Songs In The Key Of Life. With their dazzling melodies and blend of gritty politicised funk and elegant ballads, these albums appealed to rock and soul fans alike.&#xa0;</p> <p>He overreached himself on 1979's Journey Through The Secret Life Of Plants, a double concept album full of new age noodling, but he redeemed himself, critically and commercially, with 1980's Hotter Than July. And if his recordings since have been patchily received, there is consensus among music lovers that his golden age lasted longer than anyone's, Bob Dylan and the Beatles included. &#xa0;</p> <p>Wonder is adamant that his heyday of exploratory music-making is not over, despite the fact that his last album, A Time to Love,only his fourth LP proper in three decades, was issued in 2005. \"I'm still experimenting,\" he enthuses. \"There's a new instrument I'm learning to play called the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV2AtWPmOtM\" title=\"\">harpejji</a>. It's between a piano and a guitar. I'm writing really different songs with it \u2013 I have so many. The question is, will they outlive me? Time is long but life is short.\"</p> <p>Does Wonder, who has just turned 62, have a growing sense of his mortality? \"I don't feel it,\" he says of time's marching. \"I know it for a fact.\"</p> <p>He feels a pressing need to achieve in non-musical spheres, and digresses to discuss gun crime, a subject on which he has been outspoken. \"I'm concerned about how accessible guns are,\" he says. Is he referring to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/20/batman-shooting-killed-colorado-cinema\" title=\"\">\"Batman shootings\"</a> in Colorado?&#xa0;</p> <p>\"No, I'm talking about in the hood,\" he replies. \"That [Colorado] was also very sad, but this is an occurrence almost every week in various cities. But no politician wants to confront it. The right to bear arms? What about the right to live?\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Does he fear what happened to John Lennon could happen to him?</p> <p>\"I've had threats,\" he says, \"but I don't put that energy out there because that's just craziness.\"</p> <p>Can he feel the same connection to \"the street\" that he did in the 70s when he penned sociopolitical anthems such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRyf5G2uI8\" title=\"\">Living For The City</a>?</p> <p>\"Of course,\" he exclaims. \"I travel and do stuff.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>What's it like when he and his entourage sweep through town?</p> <p>\"I just focus on what I'm doing,\" he says. \"If fans take pictures ... Every time I think about getting annoyed I remember how blessed I've been to have people who have followed my career.\"</p> <p>Is he in touch with the young man who wrote, say, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDZFf0pm0SE\" title=\"\">Superstition</a>?&#xa0;</p> <p>\"Oh yeah,\" he replies, breezily. \"I listen to him.

But the reality is, your money is only as good as you're able to help others with it.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Even before his accident, when his music was at its most supersonically joyous, Wonder spoke in dread tones of an apocalyptic future, and of the ominous present presaging it. \"It's the last days of life, of beauty,\" he declared, referring darkly to \"all the horrors and hypocrisy in the world\".</p> <p>After the crash he became increasingly affirmative. But how do these times compare? Is he more optimistic now?</p> <p>\"I'm always optimistic, but the world isn't. People need to make a jump to a place of positivity but they put it all on one person to make it happen,\" he says. \"It takes everybody. And the mindset has to be different. I mean, how do we have, in 2012, racism in the world?\"</p> <p>Did he assume that racism would be obliterated?</p> <p>\"It can't be obliterated until people confront the demon in the spirit,\" he says. No wonder one of his current roles is as a Messenger of Peace for the United Nations.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"You need to put your heart into making a difference,\" he says, proposing \"an end to poverty, starvation, racism and illiteracy and finding cures for cancer and Aids\" as just some of the jobs that need doing.&#xa0;</p> <p>Doesn't he wish he could subvert his beatific image? Has the Messenger of Peace ever wanted to punch someone?</p> <p>\"No,\" he says patiently, as though to a child who has said something particularly dumb. \"When you punch somebody it means you have let your ability to communicate out the gate.\"</p> <p>Wonder mentions \"the demon in the spirit\". How has he managed to endure when his revolutionary soul peers \u2013 Marvin, Sly Stone, James Brown \u2013 succumbed to torment and temptation?&#xa0;</p> <p>\"First of all,\" he stresses, \"I'm no better than the next person. But I've never had a desire to do drugs. When I was 21 I smoked marijuana, and I didn't like the way it made me feel. When I woke up the next morning I felt like I'd lost part of my brain.\"</p> <p>Wonder has also seen the passing of younger talents: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/michaeljackson\" title=\"\">Michael Jackson</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/whitney-houston\" title=\"\">Whitney Houston</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/amywinehouse\" title=\"\">Amy Winehouse</a> ...</p> <p>\"It's been a heartbreak,\" he says. \"Obviously I knew Michael.\" In 2009 he broke down during a performance of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzyJGHjREk0\" title=\"\">Jackson's The Way You Make Me Feel</a>. \"I knew Whitney, too, and I understand Amy came to my concert in England a couple of years ago.

It would have been amazing.\"</p> <p>Had he met Winehouse, would he have offered her words of wisdom, or would there have been no point?&#xa0;</p> <p>\"There's always a point,\" he says.&#xa0;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395439186\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346348232843/Recording-We-Are-The-Worl-010.jpg\" alt=\"Recording We Are The World with Lionel Richie, Daryl Hall, Quincy Jones and Paul Simon, 1985.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recording We Are The World with Lionel Richie, Daryl Hall, Quincy Jones and Paul Simon, 1985.

I am what I am. I love me! And I don't mean that egotistically \u2013 I love that God has allowed me to take whatever it was that I had and to make something out of it.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Does he never allow himself an egotistical moment to survey his career?</p> <p>\"Nah,\" he says, \"that's a waste of time. I enjoy listening to the stuff I've done, but that's it.\"</p> <p>Is he a genius?</p> <p>\"No,\" he says, \"I was just blessed to have ideas. The genius in me is God \u2013 it's the God in me coming out.\"</p> <p>This summer, he met the Queen after performing at the jubilee concert in London.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"She was born under the same astrological sign as me: Taurus,\" he marvels. \"It was wonderful meeting her.\"</p> <p>When I suggest that, if anyone should have been bowing and scraping, it was the one who, by accident of birth, acquired enormous status and wealth, not the one who, by sheer hard graft, changed the course of popular culture, he disagrees.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"That's because you don't believe in the power and the spirit that is intangible but is all around us,\" he mildly scolds. \"There has to be a higher energy power.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, Wonder is aware of his impact, and of those who have picked up his progressive soul baton, such as Ocean. Was he surprised that there could, in 2012, be a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jul/04/frank-ocean-courage-come-out\" title=\"\">furore at the revelation that a rapper might be gay</a>?</p> <p>\"I think honestly, some people who think they're gay, they're confused,\" he says. \"People can misconstrue closeness for love. People can feel connected, they bond. I'm not saying all [gay people are confused]. Some people have a desire to be with the same sex. But that's them.\"</p> <p>In 1974, US rock critic Robert Christgau described Wonder as \"a sainted fool\". He wrote: \"I'm not saying he's a complete fool; in fact, I'm not saying he isn't a genius. But you can't deny that if you were to turn on a phone-in station and hear Stevie rapping about divine vibrations and universal brotherhood ... you would not be impressed with his intellectual discernment.\" Certainly, with Wonder, you have to suspend your cynicism. But he has to contend with being narrowcast still.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"I've never said I was a soul artist or an R&amp;B artist,\" he responds when I venture that the music he made in the 70s was a soul version of progressive rock. \"They're just labels. When you're soul it means black, when you're pop it means white. That's bullshit. If it's good, it's good. It's like that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBeBQJHhIj4\" title=\"\">old Jerry Reed song</a>: 'When you're hot, you're hot, when you're not, you're not.'\"</p>",
  "<p>This week, like the ruminant mammal enjoying a bolus of regurgitated food, Lost in Showbiz fears it must retrace <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/lostinshowbiz/2012/aug/23/prince-harry-naked-antics-britain\" title=\"\">the footsteps taken by Hadley Freeman</a> in this column last week and lead you back to Room 2401 of Las Vegas's Wynn Encore resort. You&#xa0;are doubtless familiar with its two-storey, 5,829 sq ft, three-master-bedroom interior \u2013 the 72in flat-screen television, the walls padded with mohair to absorb sound, something mysteriously described as \"privacy controls\", which, under the circumstances, they might want to send someone from maintenance up to have a look at \u2013 but news of what took place in its opulent surroundings during Prince Harry's recent Naked Romp just keeps on coming.</p> <p>First, let us examine the report \u2013 from our old friend An Anonymous Source <a href=\"http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/08/prince-harry-vegas-party-guests-cocaine-drugs-says-eyewitness\" title=\"\">on showbiz website Radar Online</a> \u2013 that the spirit of the late Hunter S Thompson was unexpectedly abroad once more in Sin City that fateful evening. Apparently, among the&#xa0;prince's new-found American friends were some people on drugs. Thus far, the papers seem to have concentrated on the angle that \"some were doing cocaine\".</p> <p>Lost in Showbiz, however, is far more intrigued by the suggestion that others had ingested psilocybin, or, as AA Source put it, were \"rolling on 'shrooms\". Lost in Showbiz wonders if it was one of them who was operating the cameraphone that US media claim was filming His Naked Romp, and if the reason footage has yet to surface is that it consists entirely of another 'shroom-user delightedly making the suite's touch-screen-operated curtains open and close for 45 minutes.</p> <p>It also likes the idea that some members of the party may have spent&#xa0;the Naked Romp trying to commandeer the stereo in order to turn off Essential R&amp;B 2012 and put on&#xa0;Ozric Tentacles' Fetch Me the Pongmaster, suggesting they all stop playing strip billiards and watch The Wizard of Oz with the sound turned down and Dark Side of the Moon playing, or \u2013 as was the case with a similarly fuelled acquaintance of Lost in Showbiz during a stag weekend in Amsterdam \u2013 continually interrupted proceedings by alternately bellowing \"I'M CLINGING ON TO SANITY BY MY&#xa0;FINGERNAILS\" and howling like a&#xa0;wolf.</p> <p>Furthermore, Lost in Showbiz is impressed to the point of awe by the notion that there were people present, tripping on powerful psychedelics, at the exact moment the third in line to the British throne decided to show his penis to everybody. It can't think of circumstances more likely to deliver a&#xa0;catastrophic blow to a psyche undergoing an intense hallucinogenic experience. If they are not currently being attended to in a psychiatric unit as a result \u2013 their faces locked into a horrified grimace, their voices mute save for the terrible, bloodcurdling scream they let out whenever they hear Ozric Tentacles' Fetch Me the Pongmaster \u2013 it can only salute their sheer mental fortitude. Here, surely, are what Allen Ginsberg would have called the best minds of our generation: people with brains of purest titanium, capable of withstanding the worst the world can throw at them.</p> <p>But let us move from the event itself to the aftermath. Lost in Showbiz is delighted to note that for every voice carping about royal duty, there are many who not merely support the Naked Romp, but feel it is the key that&#xa0;unlocks a glittering future for the&#xa0;wayward prince: when life hands&#xa0;you lemons, you go to the fully stocked wet&#xa0;bar in your two-storey, 5,829 sq ft, three-bedroom suite and make lemonade.</p> <p>It applauds the optimism of&#xa0;Las Vegas's self-styled \"Diamonds in the&#xa0;Buff\", the Chippendales, who have&#xa0;apparently invited Prince Harry&#xa0;to&#xa0;join them onstage in their custom-designed theatre complex with&#xa0;adjacent boutique \"hosting a variety of items that appeal to women\" (neon vibrating crotchless panties, $19.95). Its applause turns to a&#xa0;veritable standing ovation when it thinks of Steven Hirsch, founder and co-chairman of a company called Vivid Entertainment, who swiftly dispatched a letter to Clarence House, offering Harry not merely $10m, but \"the opportunity to truly become the coolest prince of all time,&#xa0;by starring in a fun, sexy, big-budget adult film called The Trouble with Harry\".</p> <p>\"We assure you the sex will be well-scripted,\" he added, as if Harry might expect anything other than auteur film-making and high quality mise-en-scene from the company behind Big Tit&#xa0;Jack Off, The Anal Intern and the educational Penny Flame's Expert Guide to Hand Jobs. There are voices who will doubtless suggest that any situation that commences with you taking all your clothes off in a room full of people on drugs and ends with an offer to make a celebrity porno must, by default, involve some loss of dignity. Lost in Showbiz prefers to view said situation as an unexpected platform on which the protagonist's manifold qualities can come to light. For proof, let us finally turn to Sharon Osbourne, who used a discussion on American television to inform viewers that Harry was in possession of a rare wit, which she encountered during a&#xa0;visit to Buckingham Palace: \"I said to&#xa0;him, would you watch my bag while&#xa0;I go to the loo. And he said: 'Fuck off.' How fabulous. What a fabulous answer in jest.\"</p> <p>What a week: hallucinogenic drugs,&#xa0;porn, neon vibrating crotchless panties, the kind of repartee unheard since The Vicious Circle drifted apart. Exhausted, but wide-eyed with wonder, Lost in Showbiz plaintively asks: where will it all end? Who among us can dare to predict where the Naked Romp will lead us next?</p>",
  "<p>Today, we're going to talk about race. That might have some of you heading for the exit, but rest assured: this is not about race relations. Rather, we are going to talk about race and the demographics of the 2012 electorate.</p> <p>Race matters in US politics for the simple reason that whites tend to vote Republican, while Latinos and especially African Americans tend to vote Democratic. If the proportion of the electorate that is white were to go up just 2 percentage points, that would bode very well for Mitt Romney. If the electorate were to become 2 points \"more Latino\", then President Obama would be in much better shape.</p> <p>There have been <a href=\"http://decoded.nationaljournal.com/2012/04/four-recent-national-polls-inc.php\">some arguments</a> that the percentage of whites in this year's electorate will fall from its 2008 level. That's based on the belief that Latino communities are a growing segment of the American electorate. There is just one problem with that hypothesis: it's not happening.&#xa0;</p> <p>Latinos <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/04/20/counting_minorities_are_poll_sampling_complaints_legit_113904.html\">have made up</a> a consistent 8% of the electorate since 2004, according to exit polls. Given <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/22/13415554-obama-leads-big-with-latinos-but-enthusiasm-still-lags?lite\">low Latino enthusiasm</a>, and the possibility of second- and third-generation Latinos identifying as \"white\", instead of ethnic Hispanic, the percentage of self-identifying Latinos may actually decrease.</p> <p>But let's agree, for the sake of this article, that the electorate will mirror 2008's. That's why the <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/08/why-is-obama-so-confident.html\">percentage of white voters expected</a> is being put at 74%, instead of the 72% predicted earlier this year, when some were modelling for a higher Latino percentage of the electorate. (That 74% comes from the percentage of voters who identified as white, non-Hispanic in the 2008 election, according to exit polls.)</p> <p>There is a problem with this 74% number, however. It was only the election night exit polls that pegged whites at 74%. The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/images/wysiwyg_images/Untitled-419.gif\">updated and final exit poll data</a> put whites at a slightly higher 75%. So, if we're going to take the exit poll data from 2008 as gospel, then 75% should be the percentage of whites we'd want to use as a benchmark.</p> <p>Does that mean we should assume any pollster who doesn't mirror this 75% (plus or minus 1%, given the margin of error) is incorrect? Apparently, the Obama campaign folk feel quite confident because they work off the exit polls and regard the telephone polls such as those conducted by ABC/Washington Post and Gallup as \"too white\". The reality is that exit polls are surveys, just like telephone polls. They all have sample biases.</p> <p>The most exhaustive study of exit poll biases is <a href=\"http://poq.oxfordjournals.org/content/71/4/588.short\">Michael McDonald's 2007 article, \"The True Electorate\"</a>. McDonald studied voter registration files, exit polls, and the Current Population Survey. All of these sources have their own pros and cons, but they disagree on age and race.</p> <p>Exit polls tended to report an electorate that is younger and less white than the other post-election surveys. This is not to say that the exit polls are incorrect, but rather that there are multiple \"right\" answers.</p> <p>Some surveys in 2008 matched the exit poll percentages quite well. <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/blogs/dcor110208fq21.pdf\">Democracy Corps (pdf)</a>' final poll put whites at 76% of the electorate and had Obama winning by 7 points. NBC/Wall Street Journal's <a href=\"http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/081103_NBC-WSJ_Poll.pdf\">final poll (pdf)</a> registered about 74-75% for non-Hispanic whites, and had Obama winning by 8 points. Obama actually won by 7.3 points.</p> <p>Other polls in 2008 were slightly different than the exit polls. <a href=\"http://pollingmatters.gallup.com/2012/04/whites-and-non-whites-in-gallups.html\">Gallup</a>, whose weighting practices were the subject of a seminal Mark Blumenthal <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/17/gallup-poll-race-barack-obama_n_1589937.html\">inquiry</a>, found whites to be 78% of the electorate. An ABC/Washington Post poll likewise put whites at 78%. You might expect that would lead them to underestimate Obama's margin; in fact, not \u2013 because they overestimated how well he would do among white voters. Thus Gallup predicted Obama's margin of victory would be 3.7 percentage points higher than it actually was, while the ABC/Washington Post did so by 1.7 points. </p> <p>But if we were to weight the Gallup and ABC/Washington Post surveys to match the exit polls' percentage of non-Hispanic whites in the electorate, they would have produced an even greater pro-Obama bias. For that reason, I'm extremely wary of making adjustments to some polls based on what other surveys say the percentage of the electorate that is white is likely to be.</p> <p>Instead, I tend to place more trust in pollsters whose numbers (concerning race) look relatively consistent with their 2008 data. If a pollster had whites at 75% of the electorate in 2008, then I expect them to have them at 75% for 2012 \u2013 plus or minus a few points, given the margin of error. The demographics are just not going to have changed that radically.</p> <p>Pollsters whose survey demographics on race were close to the 2008 exit polls seem to be adhering to this rule.&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.democracycorps.com/attachments/article/906/dcor.nat.polt.082812.pdf\">Democracy Corps (pdf)</a> is finding around 74% to 75% of the electorate to be non-Hispanic white \u2013 right around its 2008 number of 76%. I estimate that <a href=\"http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/A_Politics/_Today_Stories_Teases/August_NBC-WSJ_Int_Sched.pdf\">NBC/Wall Street Journal (pdf)</a> has non-Hispanic whites at about 72% (among registered voters) right now, but that percentage will almost certainly rise to a level near or slightly above 2008's 74-75% once NBC goes over to surveying likely voters.</p> <p>Pollsters whose predicted electorates were slightly \"whiter\" in 2008 than the exit polls said they were have retained that bias: Gallup has whites at 76% of registered voters, so that percentage, too, will rise to near its 2008 figure of 78% (after the switch to likely voters). Meanwhile, ABC/Washington Post's current registered voter model pegs whites at 78%, matching its 2008 likely voter percentage; a 2012 likely voter estimate will move that up slightly (though not as much <a href=\"https://twitter.com/electionate/status/239944374581075968\">as we might expect</a>) \u2013 in which case, the ABC/Washington Post's predicted percentage of white voters should still be hovering around its 2008 levels.</p> <p>I know the people at both the NBC Political Unit and Washington Post polling team, and both are top-notch. The <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/blogs/rating_pollster_accuracy_predi.php?nr=1\">accuracy ratings agree with me</a>. The two outfits, though, do happen to arrive at slightly different answers on the presidential contest right now: NBC finds Obama up 4 points, but the Washington Post sees Romney ahead by 1. One factor behind this discrepancy might be race (or rather, what the demographic surveying is telling each of them), but the past history recalled above argues otherwise. <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/08/29/minority_turnout__the_racial_breakdown_of_polls.html>As Sean Trende, who has similar quibbles to mine about polling and race, notes&lt;/a>, slight differences in the predicted composition of the electorate by race make little difference. Other demographic differences, or simply random sampling error, are more likely the culprit. I'd expect the numbers from NBC and Washington Post polling respectively to converge as election day nears.&lt;/p>&lt;p>For now, let's not get too bogged down in the demographic weeds. The &lt;a href=\" http: www.theguardian.com commentisfree 2012 aug 24 why-next-two-weeks-make-break-romney-ryan\">polling aggregates</a> indicate this election is tight \u2013 with perhaps a slight edge for President Obama.</p>",
  "<p>Black Caribbean workers received the biggest pay rises on average during the pre-recession boom years, earning more per hour than their white peers by 2008, according to new research.</p> <p>Researchers from the University of Essex say that although the gap between the hourly pay of white people and those from ethnic minorities as a whole more than doubled in the 15 years to 2008, there were marked differences between groups.</p> <p>In an article published in the latest edition of the journal Work, Employment and Society, Essex University's Malcolm Brynin and Ayse G\u00fcveli analysed more than 650,000 results from the UK's large-scale quarterly Labour Force Survey.</p> <p>This showed that in the four years beginning in 1993, pay per hour for whites averaged \u00a36.90, 40p more than that earned by black Caribbeans, 30p more than British Indians and \u00a32.20 more than Bangladeshis in the UK.</p> <p>However, in the four years to 2008, the position was reversed with black Caribbeans' average hourly pay rising to \u00a38.40 \u2013 more than whites, who earned \u00a38.10 an hour. British Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis all earned less and only British Chinese matched their Caribbean peers' hourly pay levels.</p> <p>\"It was a very surprising result,\" said Brynin, reader at the Institute for Social and Economic Research. \"But I think this is really about the success of black women in the public sector. In somewhere like nursing there is no doubt they succeeded and got well-paid, secure jobs.\"</p> <p>The academic accepted that by many measures black people appear to be seriously disadvantaged in Britain \u2013 suffering high rates of incarceration and unemployment. But he said he was concerned \"with what goes on in the labour market, not outside it\".</p> <p>Experts said \"hard-won gains\" by black people before the recession would disappear as cuts disproportionately affect ethnic minorities. Last year a quarter of a million public sector staff lost their jobs as the government's austerity measures started to bite.</p> <p>Rob Berkeley, director of the Runnymede, a race equality thinktank, said that for \"black Caribbean families the public sector is a source of stability and employment. If you see jobs going in the public sector then the impact will be particularly severe on black women. You will see their advance disappear.\"</p> <p>Berkeley also pointed out that more than half of young black people were growing up in lone-parent households. \"If levels of unemployment go up for black Caribbean women then there would be significant repercussions for the whole community.\"</p> <p>The authors of the paper also warned against the idea that the data could be used to suggest that barriers or racism do not exist for non-whites.</p> <p>In fact the gulf was growing. Brynin pointed out that in 1993 white people earned an average of 18p an hour more than non-whites, but by 2008 the gap had risen to 43p an hour.</p> <p>The paper states that most of the gap between \"whites and non-whites was caused because non-whites found it harder to get into well-paid professions and trades\".</p> <p>\"The analysis shows not only that the ethnic pay gap varies considerably by ethnic minority but that it is in large measure the result of occupational segregation,\" the authors say.</p> <p>Even where the two groups worked in the same profession or trade, there was a gap in pay \u2013 by 2008 whites were earning an average of 18p an hour more than non-whites doing the same type of work. This compared to 1993 when non-whites earned an average of 3p an hour more than whites in the same profession or trade.</p> <p>Brynin said the overall gap had widened despite the fact that the proportion of people in most ethnic minorities groups working in managerial jobs was about the same as whites by 2008 \u2013 around 45%. This was probably because non-whites did not get \"ahead in the job hierarchy\".</p> <p>\"It is clear that on this basis most ethnic minorities earn consistently less than white people, if not always by much. One implication is that some minorities do not earn as much as their education would warrant.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 31 August 2012 to clarify Malcolm Brynin's affiliation.</p>",
  "<p>It's now nearly half a century since two black American athletes, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, supported by the Australian athlete Peter Norman, made history at the 1968 Mexico Olympics by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/feb/08/olympic-moments-tommie-smith-john-carlos\" title=\"\">staging a protest against racial discrimination</a>.</p> <p>There is little chance of a similar protest against disability discrimination by medal winners at the London Paralympic Games. But for many disabled people such a high-profile protest would be timely, in the face of a tidal wave of prejudice and discrimination against disabled people. This is embodied both in the coalition government's welfare reform and wider social policies, and the acceptance of Olympic sponsors such as Atos and the Dow Chemical Company. The latter companies have come to be associated in many disabled people's minds with cruelly disablist policies: in the case of Atos for carrying out harsh and discriminatory disability benefits assessments and Union Carbide (a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow) for failing in its responsibilities to the many people disabled by the Bhopal disaster.</p> <p>The rush of good feeling engendered by the success of the London Olympics and Team GB will doubtless carry the Paralympics in its slipstream. But the growing gap between the positive rhetoric underpinning the Paralympics and the day to day experience of thousands of disabled people in Britain raises big questions. Isn't it a betrayal of every Olympic ideal?</p> <p>More to the point, isn't it a betrayal of the rights and needs of all disabled people, old and young, in a civilised society? The Paralympics show just what disabled people are capable of, with support and when they are valued. Cuts in disability benefits, social care and mainstream services, meanwhile, are likely to make it impossible for other disabled people to come close to their potential.</p> <p>Disabled people are far too important for the Paralympics to be used as a fig leaf to hide the oppression and discrimination they seem increasingly to face. Ultimately this can only bring the games into disrepute.</p> <p>We must also recognise the wider complicity many of us have in disability policies. The government would hardly be pursuing them, against a significant minority, unless it calculated it had public opinion on its side \u2013 opinion prepared to go along with the view that in hard times, disabled people should no longer expect so much and need to tighten their belts too.</p> <p>The Olympics are meant to encourage optimism. Perhaps there will be a big government and tabloid media change of heart about disabled people after the Paralympics. But let's not hold our breath.</p> <p>The issue now is not so much what legacy the London Paralympics will leave, but what legacy policymakers are leaving the growing number of disabled people that will help make up society in the future and what the rest of us plan to do about this. On this occasion, the most important and effective protest is likely to be one that extends far beyond the Olympic Stadium, beyond disabled people, to embrace the rest of us.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-social-care-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the social care network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>"
