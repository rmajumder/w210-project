  "<p>Sarah Storey joined the ranks of Britain's greatest ever Paralympians on Thursday, winning her fourth cycling gold medal of the London Games in the women's road race in an utterly imperious ride that saw her finish more than seven minutes ahead of her closest rival.</p> <p>So dominant was the 34-year-old from Cheshire in the 64km race that by the second lap of the Brands Hatch course, having left the women's field far behind her, she caught and passed the peloton of the men's road race, which had started two minutes earlier.</p> <p>Her victory, the 11th gold of a career spanning six Paralympic Games, equals the modern-era records of wheelchair racer Tanni Grey-Thompson and swimmer Dave Roberts. But the cyclist's tally is all the more remarkable given that she began her Paralympics career, as a 14-year-old at the Barcelona Games, as a swimmer, winning two golds and three silvers in her debut appearance in 1992. London is her second Games competing as a cyclist \u2013 she won double gold in Beijing in her track and time trial debut.</p> <p>Speaking immediately after the race, Storey said she was \"just so chuffed\" to have matched in the road racing the two golds she won in the velodrome, after taking time trial gold with an almost equally comfortable win on Wednesday.</p> <p>\"The crowds around the course, and coming into the finish straight every single lap, I wanted to be able to say 'thank you', but obviously I had to keep my head down, make sure I made no mistakes.\"</p> <p>The race \"hurt a lot but it was amazing\", added Storey, who was able to savour her success by free-wheeling across the line.</p> <p>\"The Americans went off to send everyone up the road one at a time. I decided to test some legs. I had a bit of gas to spare, so I dug in \u2013 62km on my own.\"</p> <p>Asked about equalling the records of Roberts and Grey-Thompson, Storey said: \"To be even on the same page \u2026 as Tanni, but to have won 11 and made today a clean sweep for this week is just a dream come true. I can't thank enough people. I'm so proud to be part of such an amazing team and I'm just so pleased to be finished now as well.\"</p> <p>Storey, who competed as Sarah Bailey before her marriage to the cyclist Barney Storey, was born with an underdeveloped left hand. She only narrowly missed selection for the team pursuit squad at the Olympic Games, with whom she has previously won World Cup medals.</p> <p>Together with the gold and silver medals won in the Paralympic velodrome by her husband, who rides as a sighted tandem pilot with Neil Fachie, Storey's latest gold would take the couple on their own to 20th place in the medals table, ahead of South Africa, New Zealand and Mexico.</p> <p>Storey credits her 35-year-old husband, whom she met through the sport in 2004, for much of her cycling success, saying: \"Barney's at the centre of my world, his expertise in cycling is just phenomenal. Before he was a tandem pilot he was an able-bodied solo sprinter, riding World Cup events, spring grands prix in Europe.</p> <p>\"Barney's got an immense knowledge and background in cycling. And when I came along, this big-shouldered, raw swimmer, he taught me everything.\"</p> <p>Speaking after Storey's time trial victory, which the cyclist said had been inspired by the performances of Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome in the Olympics road race, the Team GB coach Shane Sutton said her achievement was \"right up there\" with the performances of Chris Hoy and Usain Bolt in the earlier Games. \"What she has achieved is incredible. She is as good as any able-bodied cyclist around at the moment.\"</p> <p>He said he would not be surprised if Storey were to qualify for the able-bodied competition in Rio in four years' time, when the women's pursuit team expands from three to four riders.</p>",
  "<p>Channel 4 and London 2012 organisers have defended the fact they did not provide live coverage of Sarah Storey's historic victory in the cycling road race, one of the biggest moments of the Paralympic Games.</p> <p>The event was not covered live by Channel 4, which blamed the fact that the host broadcaster, Olympic Broadcasting Services, did not provide a live feed or live timing and graphics information. Nor will the channel, which is providing an unprecedented level of coverage from the London Paralympics, be able to show David Weir's attempt to win the wheelchair marathon live on the concluding day on Sunday. OBS, which is paid by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games to provide coverage, has cameras at only certain venues for economic reasons. The number of hours broadcast overseas is far lower than for the Olympics, so OBS is unable to provide the same breadth of coverage.</p> <p>\"We would love to show every session of Paralympic sport live and we are sure that day will come but for now we had to make choices based on the available budget,\" a Locog spokeswoman said. \"More Paralympic sports have been covered live at London 2012 than any other Paralympic Games and the schedule was agreed with all the rights holding broadcasters in advance of the Games.\"</p> <p>The level of coverage that OBS provides was stipulated in the contract agreed when Channel 4 outbid the BBC to win the rights in a deal worth around \u00a39m in 2010. The broadcaster, which is showing more than 150 hours of live coverage on its main channel and has cleared its schedules for the event, has had to augment the OBS coverage with its own cameras.</p> <p>At Brands Hatch for Storey's fourth gold of these Games and 11th overall, equalling the total gained by Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson, the broadcaster has been restricted to showing highlights and reports from its cycling expert Ned Boulting.</p> <p>Insiders have pointed out that the volume of coverage and scale of ambition are much greater than anything attempted for the Paralympics before. Locog said that, despite selling the rights to more countries than ever before, it would have been simply uneconomic for OBS to provide live coverage from the cycling road race at Brands Hatch and the marathon in central London.</p> <p>OBS was involved in other controversies during the Olympics. Before the Games, there were clashes between Danny Boyle's creative team and OBS over camera positions for the opening ceremony. And there were furious complaints from cycling fans over the lack of timing information provided during Mark Cavendish's failed bid to win the men's road race, after the GPS units used by organisers failed to work.</p> <p>A Channel 4 spokesman said: \"The host broadcasters OBS do not provide live coverage, or live timing and graphics, for the Paralympic road cycling events \u2013 although Channel 4 has put in place cameras at Brands Hatch and Ned Boulting has broadcast highlights and updates throughout our coverage. Channel 4 is broadcasting an unprecedented level of coverage of the London 2012 Paralympic Games, with through-the-day coverage broadcast on Channel 4 and around 500 hours of coverage in total across our channels.\"</p> <p>Encouraged by healthy ratings for its Paralympic coverage, which has peaked at more than 3m every night and attracted more than 11m for the opening ceremony, Channel 4 recently moved its only block of non-Paralympic programming to More4. It also providing three live streams via its website and is airing more than 400 hours in total.</p>",
  "<p>A rash of legal challenges to a core piece of US civil rights legislation is threatening the foundations of nearly half a century of laws to combat racial discrimination.</p> <p>Republican-led state legislatures from Florida and Texas to Alaska have engineered a series of legal showdowns with the federal government over the 1965 Voting Rights Act that, following several court rulings last week, appear likely to end up before a US supreme court which has already hinted it is ready to revisit the heart of the law.</p> <p>Civil rights activists warn that if the supreme court strikes down a key section of the Voting Rights Act, which gives the federal government some control over elections in states with a history of blocking African Americans from voting, then separate legislation affecting discrimination in other areas, such as in employment, education and housing, may also be vulnerable.</p> <p>The moves against the Voting Rights Act also come as Texas and other states separately challenge the legality of racially-based affirmative action programmes in what some lawyers see as a concerted attempt to undermine and even kill off decades of civil rights legislation.</p> <p>The legal assault has zeroed in on a provision of the Voting Rights Act which requires nine states \u2013 Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia \u2013 to seek approval from the US justice department in Washington for changes to voting laws or procedures. Some districts in seven other states are also bound by the legislation.</p> <p>\"There has been a proliferation of cases that aim to take down and rip out this core provision of the Voting Rights Act,\" said Debo Adegbile, acting president and lead counsel of the NAACP legal defence fund, who has argued in the defence of the law at the supreme court. \"I think it's fair to say that the supreme court invited these challenges.\"</p> <p>Several states have taken on the Obama administration over the law with legislation requiring people to produce photo identification to vote, redrawing electoral boundaries and measures limiting voter registration.</p> <p>Obama's justice department has won a series of victories in recent weeks in which federal courts ruled that the changes amounted to racial discrimination and attempts to manipulate elections.</p> <p>Last week, courts in Washington DC separately struck down <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/28/texas-loses-electoral-maps-latinos\">plans by Texas to redraw constituency boundaries</a> because they diminished the impact of a rapidly growing Latino vote and to require photo identification at the polls, which the court said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/30/texas-battle-voter-id-law\">would discourage minorities from voting</a>.</p> <p>The justice department has won similar victories over changes to election laws and procedures in other states, including Alabama and Florida, and is fighting legislation by South Carolina in a case the Obama administration appears likely to win.</p> <p>But they may prove pyrrhic victories. Several state governments are looking to the conservative-leaning supreme court \u2013 which has already expressed its doubts about racially-based policy \u2013 to challenge the provision of the Voting Rights Act requiring \"pre-clearance\" by the US justice department, known as Section 5.</p> <p>Nathaniel Persily, a Columbia University law professor whose work was cited in earlier supreme court opinion on the issue, said it is only a matter of time before the supreme court strikes at the heart of the Voting Rights Act by limiting the federal government's ability to enforce the legislation.</p> <p>\"The question is not whether Section 5 of the voting rights act will be struck down, but when and how. Will it die a death of a thousand cuts? Or will it be killed with one swift blow?\" he said.</p> <p>Persily said the supreme court hinted at its willingness to declare Section 5 unconstitutional in a 2009 ruling which upheld the Voting Rights Act while laying the seeds of its potential destruction.</p> <p>In that case, officials in Austin, Texas said they should not have to ask Washington's permission to move a polling place from a house to a public school. The supreme court upheld the Voting Rights Act, which was extended for 25 years by large majorities in both houses of Congress in 2006.</p> <p>But the chief justice, John Roberts, raised doubts about whether Section 5 could survive. He said the failure of Congress to update the law to take account of the changes it has brought about \u2013 such as black and white people voting in similar proportions across the south \u2013 raised questions about its constitutionality.</p> <p>\"The south has changed. The evil that Section 5 is meant to address may no longer be concentrated in the jurisdictions singled out for pre-clearance. The statute's coverage formula is based on data that is now more than 35 years old, and there is considerable evidence that it fails to account for current political conditions,\" Roberts wrote.</p> <p>While flagging up his doubts, Roberts said that \"the importance of the question does not justify our rushing to decide it\" \u2013 a view widely read as encouraging further legal challenges to the law so the supreme court can consider the matter at length.</p> <p>The chief justice's comments opened the floodgates. Since the 2009 ruling there have been more legal challenges to Section 5 than in the previous 44 years of its existence. <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/texas-politics/as-texas-voter-id-law-heads-to-hearing-2413543.html\">Texas</a> and Florida have already said they intend to ask to the supreme court to hear their cases. Two weeks ago,<a href=\"http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/more-alaska-redistricting-litigation-attorney-general-challenges-voting-rights-act-precleara\"> Alaska filed a constitutional challenge</a> to its obligations under Section 5.</p> <p>But the case closest to a hearing is out of an Alabama county, Shelby.</p> <p>The county's legal bills are being paid by the <a href=\"http://www.projectonfairrepresentation.org\">Project on Fair Representation</a>, which describes itself as a legal defence fund fighting \"the creation of racially gerrymandered voting districts\". Its director, Edward Blum, says that Section 5 exceeds Congress's powers under the constitution and that it punishing states for past sins.</p> <p>\"Section 5 was a draconian yet completely necessary provision in 1965 when mostly southern jurisdictions we purposely shutting out blacks from the ballot box. Today, however, Section 5 is no longer a needed remedy and has evolved into a racial gerrymandering tool,\" he said. \"African Americans and Hispanics no longer live in barrios and ghettos. Over the last 40 years, inner city America, which was heavily minority, has emptied out and African Americans and Hispanics live in all corners of these large major metropolitan areas now.\"</p> <p>But Adegbile said that the proliferation of laws being blocked by the justice department and courts under Section 5 is evidence of continued need for the Voting Rights Act. </p> <p>\"Courts with judges appointed by Republican presidents and Democratic presidents are saying these underlying voting changes are discriminatory and will harm minority voters,\" he said. \"What we see is a rash of voting measures targeted at minority voters in a number of places across the country that surprises folks who believed we had moved beyond though practices. I think the average person understands that it seems there's still different ways that you can try to win elections. One is by mobilising your voters. The other is by blocking a certain segment of the electorate and that second approach remains, unfortunately, a technique that is being deployed in too many places around the country.\"</p> <p>The supreme court has also taken up another case, involving race based affirmative action, that potentially has a profound impact on civil rights. Abigail Fisher sued after she was denied a place at the University of Texas claiming that she was discriminated against because she is white.</p> <p>In 2003, a divided supreme court ruled that a student's race could be considered in order to achieve a diverse university student body, but only after attempting to use other means. Fisher argues that Texas law already provides for a diverse admissions policy and therefore race based affirmative action was unnecessary.</p> <p>The Project on Fair Representation is financially backing that legal challenge, too. Blum said that he regards affirmative action based on race as a mistake from the beginning. \"Affirmative action assumed that all African Americans regardless of their family income or their family educational background were deserving of some special help,\" he said.</p> <p>Persily said that if that central part of the Voting Rights Act is struck down then other civil rights legislation is likely to come under legal attack.</p> <p>\"The thing about Section 5 of the voting rights act is that it's been the standard against which all other exercises of federal power in the civil rights realm have been judged. When you're talking about the disabilities act or the age discrimination in employment act or any number of other pieces of legislation, when the courts find problems with those laws they say they're not as good as the voting rights act,\" he said.</p> <p>\"So now the gold standard for civil rights legislation is potentially going to be declared unconstitutional with unclear repercussions for all kinds of other laws.\"</p> <p>Adegbile agrees. \"If the rulings were overly broad, the knock-on effect could be felt in other areas such as employment, education and the like. I think that there are serious threats,\" he said.</p> <p>Blum hopes so, saying that he believes employment laws and public contracting, in which a proportion of government contracts are awarded to minority-owned firms, will be particularly vulnerable to legal challenge.</p> <p>For Adegbile, the looming supreme court battles are a test of where the US stands on civil rights half a century after the laws that changed America.</p> <p>\"Right now we are at a moment where there are competing visions of equality and opportunity in America. One side says that we have to celebrate our progress but recognise that we can do better. The other view is that we should stop talking about our history. We should deny the context, and we should move past all of this as if to pretend that racial discrimination does not continue to exist in America.\"</p>",
