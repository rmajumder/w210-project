  "<p><em>[Updated below - Update II (Fri.)]</em></p> <p>Vanity Fair just published <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/10/michael-lewis-profile-barack-obama\">a lengthy profile of Barack Obama</a> by Michael Lewis, a profile he was able to write by \"hanging around Barack Obama for six months, in the White House, aboard Air Force One, and on the basketball court\". How did Lewis get such extensive, unfettered access to the President? In large part, it was by agreeing that he would give the White House full veto power over any quotes he wanted to include, as <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/12/161003362/michael-lewis-studies-obamas-way\">he told NPR today</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"'My whole goal was to create a very natural environment so I could observe him without lots of people worrying about how it was going to be made to look in print.<em> So the agreement I had with him was, 'Don't worry about me. I don't mind you vetting his quotes, and if you set me up with an interview with someone else in the White House and I want to quote that person, I'll show you those quotes, too', and that ended up happening</em>. . . .</p> <p>\"So I sent those in, and they did almost nothing to them. Very, very little. . . .\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It's understandable that the White House exercised the quote-approval power he gave them \"very, very little,\" because most of the profile is filled with admiration, fluff, and awe. That's hardly surprising given this incredibly revealing passage, in which Lewis -- who is pictured at the top of the article strolling with the President as they both smile at each other -- watches Obama play basketball against younger men and then speaks afterward to one of those players [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"No one held back, no one deferred. Guys on [Obama's] team dribbled past him and ignored the fact he was wide open. . . .</p> <p>\"'No one seems to be taking it easy on [Obama],' I said.</p> <p>'If you take it easy on him, you're not invited back,' he explained.</p> <p><em>I thought to myself, It must be hard not to take it easy on the president</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p>In an act of glaring and extreme projection, Lewis purports to imagine what it's like to play basketball with the president but is obviously revealing his own thoughts: it's \"hard not to take it easy on the president\", he writes. That is more or less the motto of modern American journalism.</p> <p>That's not to say that there are no revealing passages. Lewis writes that when Obama learned he won the Nobel Peace Prize, he spoke to his speechwriters and \"told them he intended to use the acceptance speech to make the case for war\". And Lewis wrote, presumably channeling Obama, that \"the Nobel Prize Committee had just made it a tiny bit harder for him to do the job he'd just been elected to do, as he could not at once be commander in chief of the most powerful force on earth and the face of pacifism\". </p> <p>But those were obviously facts the White House wanted the public to hear in the months leading up to the election. In fact, one can say the same about every quote in Lewis' article, since, by virtue of the terms Lewis agreed to, none could appear unless the White House gave explicit permission. Whatever that arrangement is, it is not journalism (as some media outlets are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/us/politics/national-journal-bars-quotations-tweaked-by-sources.html\">now acknowledging</a>). It's more akin to what someone would set out to do when they believe that \"it must be hard not to take it easy on the president\".</p> <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: George Orwell <a href=\"http://quotevadis.com/post/25110952622/george-orwell-everything-else-is-pr\">famously wrote</a>: \"Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printed: everything else is public relations\". If a writer in advance promises the subject of their profile that nothing will be revealed except that which they explicitly approve, then it's not exactly difficult to determine in which of these two endeavors that writer is engaged.</p> <p><strong>UPDATE II (Fri.)</strong>: Several commenters have responded that there's nothing \"surprising\" about this quote-approval practice because it has been a common practice for so long. Leaving aside the fact that I never said or suggested there was anything \"surprising\" about any of this, there are several brief points worth making in response:</p> <p><strong>(1)</strong> Whether certain conduct is \"surprising\" is totally irrelevant to whether it is worthy of condemnation. That Behavior X is common (and therefore \"unsurprising\") does not remotely negate the view that Behavior X is wrong and destructive; the former point is a non sequitur to the latter. Indeed, this mentality -- that once a certain practice becomes common it no longer merits real condemnation -- is itself quite harmful, for reasons I <a href=\"http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2012/09/cynicism-as-enabling-force-for-power.html\">set forth recently here</a>.</p> <p><strong>(2)</strong> The New York Times apparently did not believe that this practice was so common and long-standing as to be worthy of being overlooked, giving that, just two months ago, they published a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/us/politics/latest-word-on-the-campaign-trail-i-take-it-back.html?pagewanted=all\">long article blowing the whistle</a> on these quote-approval arrangements, ones offered to Obama campaign officials by several news outlets including the Times itself. That Times article prompted widespread discussion among media professionals, journalism professors, and media critics precisely because it was not very well known that this practice had become anywhere near this pervasive.</p> <p><strong>(3)</strong> There are many news outlets that clearly do not take such a dismissive stance toward this quote-approval practice because -- both before that Times article and since -- they prohibit their reporters from entering into such arrangements on the grounds that such agreements are journalistically corrupt. That includes <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/181346/ap-doesnt-let-sources-approve-quotes-beforehand/\">Associated Press</a>, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/23/national-journal-bans-quote-approval_n_1694434.html\">National Journal</a>, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/07/mcclatchy-joins-quoteapproval-opposition-129624.html\">McClatchy</a> and others.</p> <p><strong>(4)</strong> The excuse journalists use here is the same one they use to justify the indiscriminate granting of anonymity: <em>we have to do this, or they won't talk to us, and it's better to get corrupted access than none at all</em>. I think the opposite is true: it's better to have no access than corrupted access, as there really is nothing worse for a journalist than to serve eagerly as a P.R. stenographer for a politician. </p> <p>But even if this excuse were convincing, its premise is factually inaccurate. Politicians need media to cover them and convey their messages. If journalists stopped offering politicians corrupt arrangements -- quote-approval power and the ability to hide behind anonymity for no good reason -- then politicians would be trained to know that such arrangements would not be available to them and would stop expecting them. These excuses are nothing more than attempts to wrap what is plainly careerist, access-desperate, subservient behavior into a pretty package of noble journalistic justification (<em>we're just doing this, as distasteful as we find it, in order to keep our readers informed</em>). </p> <p>No readers are being \"informed\" by the publication of a profile in which the subject of the profile has the power to decide what does and does not get printed. They're being propagandized.</p>",
  "<p>The crisis engulfing Greece has deepened after two of the governing coalition parties resisted demands from Brussels for 50,000 public sector job cuts, and unions called a general strike for this month.</p> <p>The left-of-centre Pasok and Democratic Left parties vowed to prevent the government from capitulating to demands for jobs cuts after figures revealed a jump in the unemployment rate to almost 24%.</p> <p>Tensions rose inside the prime minister's official residence, the Maximos Mansion, during a meeting of the three party leaders that make up Greece's new government. Under pressure from Brussels, right-of-centre prime minister Antonis Samaras has promised to find an extra \u20ac11.5bn (\u00a39.2bn) in public spending cuts and tax rises over the next two years, and is under pressure to fire large numbers of workers as part of the plan.</p> <p>Democratic Left leader Fotis Kouvelis, who has already voiced his objections to the plan, was joined in opposition at the crunch meetings by Pasok leader Evangelos Venizelos, who said: \"For us there is no question of layoffs of civil servants.\"</p> <p>Venizelos, who is also under pressure to agree a six-day working week as part of the proposals, said Greeks must continue to enjoy the labour rights enjoyed by other Europeans.</p> <p>\"There can be no further change in labour relations beyond the European framework. Whatever is valid in the rest of Europe must also be valid in Greece. We are a member state of the European Union, not just the eurozone.\"</p> <p>Echoing widespread concerns that cuts will drive Greece further into recession, he insisted that the financial realignment deadline of 2013-14 must be extended another two years to 2015-16: \"Just as I said \u2026 after my discussion with the troika, the extension of the fiscal adjustment period to four years is a foregone conclusion. The discussion with the troika was also based on this case.\"</p> <p>The troika is made up of officials from Brussels, the European Central Bank in Frankfurt and the Washington-based International Monetary Fund, whose inspectors are concluding a review that will determine whether Greece gets further aid.</p> <p>A spokesman said the government would resist proposals for further wage cuts and was making \"every effort to not touch labour relations\". Simos Kedikoglou said a pay reduction of 6% for police and military personnel, which is among the proposals in a package of austerity measures, must be overturned. \"We have already lowered labour costs, and there is no reason for such issues to be raised by the troika\", Kedikoglou said.</p> <p>Unions called for a 24-hour stoppage on 24 September as the jobless rate hit 23.6%, leaving 1.17m people out of work.</p> <p>Although no final agreement was reached between the coalition parties, Venizelos said there had been an \"improvement\" in the discussions and that an end was in sight.</p> <p>French finance minister Pierre Moscovici, in Greece for talks with Samaras said: \"The essential thing is that the commitments made by Greece are met and that an agreement is reached with the troika.\"</p> <p>Analysts said Moscovici showed no sign of being willing to back Greek requests for an extension of its latest bailout package, saying that it was vital that the conservative-led government in Athens maintained \"determination\" in pursuing reform goals.</p> <p>\"We hope that this determination is unwavering,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Mustafa Abu Shagour will be spending much of his time as Libya's prime minister grappling with the country's grave domestic security problems, which have been painfully highlighted by the assault that killed the US ambassador in Benghazi.</p> <p>Abu Shagour, a US-trained optical engineer who is admired for his negotiating skills, clinched victory by just two votes on Wednesday night over the better-known Mahmoud Jibril, architect of the rebel opposition and lobbyist for the Nato intervention that helped overthrow Muammar Gaddafi last year.</p> <p>Libya's first democratically elected leader presents himself as a unity candidate who will work with liberals, Islamists and independents when he takes office next month. Problems await at every turn but at the top of his intray is the need to impose central government authority over the groups of <em>thuwar</em> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/10/libya-split-between-militias\" title=\"\">(revolutionaries) who control separate fiefdoms</a> and have largely refused to lay down their weapons more than a year since Tripoli fell.</p> <p>Efficient delivery of basic services, long-term economic development, oil exports, foreign investment, a lack of strong institutions and transitional justice also require urgent attention. Political infighting and drawing up a new constitution are taking up time and effort.</p> <p>Libya has suffered from serious insecurity in recent months. Incidents include clashes between rival brigades, revenge attacks against Gaddafi loyalists and ordinary disputes settled by force because the judicial system is not functioning.</p> <p>Early efforts to create a national army and police force gave way to a practice of subcontracting security to militias whose commanders were ordered to quell tribal fighting in the western mountains and Saharan towns. During the July election, ballots were counted at the headquarters of Benghazi's strongest militia.</p> <p>\"The strategy of trying to dismantle the regional militias while simultaneously making use of them as hired guns might be sowing the seeds for the country's descent into warlordism,\" the Carnegie Endowment's <a href=\"http://carnegieendowment.org/2012/07/15/libya-s-militia-menace/csdq\" title=\"\">Frederic Wehrey warned in a recent article</a>.</p> <p>Little is known about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/13/chris-stevens-libya-brutal-death\" title=\"\">Ansar al-Sharia group in Benghazi</a>, which was reported to have demonstrated at the US consulate over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/muhammad-film-reaction-middle-east\" title=\"\">offensive film about the prophet Muhammad</a>, though it claimed it took part in a \"spontaneous popular uprising\". Its symbols are a Qur'an and a Kalashnikov, hinting at its Salafi-jihadi ideology. But it denied targeting the US ambassador.</p> <p>\"This is not sustainable,\" said Robert Malley of the International Crisis Group (ICG), whose new report on Libya highlights the challenges ahead. \"The new government needs to take concrete steps to reform its security forces and establish structures of a functioning state. Anything less will perpetuate what already is in place: local disputes \u2026 in a fragmented and heavily armed landscape.\"</p> <p>Shagour has said that security is his number one priority but linked this to the need to create jobs for young people.</p> <p>Pressure from the US and European allies such as Britain is certain to increase in the wake of the Benghazi attack. Only two days after the storming of Gaddafi's compound in Tripoli last August, Hillary Clinton called on the National Transitional Council to take \"a firm stand against violent extremists\" \u2013 meaning Islamists.</p> <p>The Benghazi killing, the ICG now says, must serve as \"wakeup call\" for Shaghour and colleagues. \"There is much to celebrate in post-Gaddafi Libya but also reason to worry,\" the report argues. \"The battle between central government and armed groups is not yet won, yet of late the latter have been acting as if they enjoyed the upper hand. If steps are not swiftly taken, reversing this trend is only going to get harder \u2013 and what has been a relatively good news story could turn depressingly sour. Precipitous moves against the armed groups are likely to fail and backfire. But time is running out, the government is plagued by inertia, and the need for across-the-board reforms of the military and police is more urgent than ever.\"</p>",

In fact, 16 September 1992 was liberation day for the UK economy, which was slowly being strangled by membership of the European exchange rate mechanism, the forerunner of the single currency.</p> <p>The effects of that momentous 24 hours live on two decades later. Without Black Wednesday, Tony Blair would never have become prime minister, there would have been no monetary policy committee, and Britain, in all likelihood, would have been part of monetary union. David Cameron, who can be seen in the<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHDsO7gvXHQ\" title=\"\"> footage of Norman Lamont </a>announcing Britain's exit from the ERM as the autumn night closed in around the Treasury, would still be a young MP working his way up through the Conservative ranks.</p> <p>British politics was turned on its head as a result of the humiliation of John Major's government. Labour had just suffered its fourth straight general election defeat in April 1992 and, deep down, its leaders thought it possible they would never form a majority administration again. In 1997, Blair won the biggest victory in Labour's history and went on to do what Attlee and Wilson had never managed: to serve two full terms in Downing Street.</p> <p>By contrast, the Conservative brand suffered permanent damage. The four election victories from 1979 and 1992 were not because the Conservatives being liked, but because they had the reputation for being more competent managers of the economy than a Labour party still tainted by the austerity programme imposed on Britain by the International Monetary Fund in 1976. That reputation was shredded when the Major government surrendered to the power of financial speculation and, despite the strong bounce in the economy between late 1992 and May 1997, voters neither forgave nor forgot. For the Conservatives, if not the country, it was indeed Black Wednesday.</p> <p>The economic and political crisis of September 1992 had its origins in the raging boom of 1987 and 1988. Until then, the government of Margaret Thatcher had believed it had cracked Britain's long-term economic problems, with several years of strong growth and low inflation in the mid-80s. The then chancellor, Nigel Lawson, decided that the best way to keep the cost of living in check was for the pound to shadow the German mark, believing that this would import Teutonic anti-inflationary zeal into the UK.</p> <p>It was a policy disaster. Interest rates were cut to prevent sterling from rising and this led to an orgy of mortgage borrowing. House prices rose sharply and so did inflation, from a trough of just over 2% in 1986 to almost 10% in 1990. By that point Lawson had gone, but his successor \u2013 Major \u2013 decided that the way for Britain to kick its inflation habit for good was to join the ERM, a device by which European currencies had to trade within fixed bands against the mark. The central point of the UK's band was DM2.95 and it was only allowed to fluctuate by 6% in either direction \u2013 from DM2.78 to DM3.13.</p> <p>The Treasury was convinced that ERM membership would provide a solid anchor for monetary policy, and the decision to join in October 1990 was welcomed by all three main political parties, the CBI and the TUC.</p> <p>Unfortunately, two things conspired to wreck the ERM experiment. Firstly, at that very moment the economy was plunging into a deep recession triggered by a doubling of interest rates from 7.5% in the summer of 1988 to 15% in the autumn of 1989. Unemployment rose sharply and many of those who had bought homes during the boom found themselves out of work, unable to pay their mortgages and sitting in homes worth a lot less than they had paid for them. Repossessions rose to record levels, as did bankruptcies.</p> <p>The second factor was the reunification of Germany at the end of the cold war, which led to rapid growth and upward pressure on inflation in 1991 and 1992. Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, raised interest rates and this made the mark more attractive to investors, leading to an increase in its value. Countries that had their currencies pegged to the mark came under pressure to raise their own rates in order to keep within their ERM bands. By the summer of 1992, the Major government was facing a dilemma.</p> <p>The poor state of the domestic economy \u2013 with the jobless count heading towards three million for the second time in a decade \u2013 necessitated cutting interest rates. However, the discipline of ERM membership meant there was pressure to raise them.</p> <p>Major and Lamont insisted that there was not the slightest possible chance of this dilemma being resolved by Britain leaving the ERM, issuing a stream of increasingly defiant speeches culminating in one by the prime minister to the Scottish CBI in Glasgow six days before Black Wednesday in which he attacked those peddling \"quack doctor\" remedies. \"The soft option, the devaluer's option, the inflationary option, in my judgment that would be a betrayal of our future at this moment, and I tell you categorically that is not the government's policy,\" Major said to applause.</p> <p>The government did its best to avoid the \"soft option\". Lamont pleaded with the Germans to cut rates. They refused. The British government made large-scale intervention in markets as the pound dropped towards DM2.77. The pound refused to budge. And on Black Wednesday itself, there was an announcement that interest rates were being raised from 10% to 12%. When that failed to stem the tidal wave of selling, Lamont announced that rates would go to 15% the following morning.</p> <p>In truth, this marked the moment when the white flag of surrender was raised above the Treasury and the Bank, because the financial markets knew that Lamont could not implement rates of 15% without completely wrecking the economy. The London stock market rallied before the close.</p> <p>By the next morning, the government was making the best of things. Interest rates were cut and continued to come down until they stood at 6% by early 1993. Home loans became easier to finance and consumers had more disposable income to spend. Outside the ERM, the pound fell by 15%, making British exports cheaper. A 16-year long period of continuous expansion began almost immediately.</p> <p>A number of key lessons were provided by Black Wednesday. The government had, at various times, tried to cut borrowing, restrict different measures of the money supply, shadowed the mark and joined the ERM in the hope of securing low and stable inflation. Now it decided to target low and stable inflation directly through an inflation target. The monetary framework that exists today had its genesis on 16 September 1992.</p> <p>Politicians of both parties also realised that ceding control over interest rates and the exchange rate was a risky business. The fact that the UK economy was not aligned with the German economy in 1992 meant the Major government was forced to import an entirely inappropriate set of policies. When the time came to decide whether Britain should join the single currency in 2003, Gordon Brown wisely insisted that the UK economy should show convergence with the other members and be flexible enough to cope with unexpected shocks as conditions of membership.</p> <p>A third lesson was that it was impossible for governments running dumb economic policies to resist the power of the financial markets. Major and his ministers dug their own grave by insisting, in the face of the evidence, that the policy was going to plan and could not be altered under any circumstances. That lesson has, perhaps, not been so well learnt.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>1. Coming off the Gold Standard in 1931</strong></h2> <p>Winston Churchill during his time as chancellor put Britain back on the Gold Standard at its pre-war rate of $4.86 against the dollar with disastrous consequences. The economy was already struggling and returning to the Gold Standard made UK exports uncompetitive. The global downturn following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 deepened the slump and make it impossible for the minority Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald to hold the line, despite unpopular welfare cuts. Leaving the Gold Standard for good helped the economy recover in the 1930s but split the Labour party.</p> <h2><strong>2. The devaluation of 1949</strong></h2> <p>Britain paid a high economic price for victory in the second world war. The country was flat broke and its industrial base, battered by six years of conflict, needed to be converted back into civilian use. The Attlee government negotiated a loan with the Americans, but was forced by Washington to make sterling convertible with the dollar in return. Britain was unable to compete with the much more productive US economy, and this resulted first in the crisis of 1947, followed by the devaluation of the pound from $4.03 to $2.80 two years later. Labour won a general election in 1950, but only just, and was ousted from power in 1951.</p> <h2><strong>3. The devaluation of 1967</strong></h2> <p>The UK performed less well than its main rivals in the so-called Golden Age of the 1950s and 1960s. Growth was strong and jobs plentiful, but Britain found it hard to compete with the United States, France and Germany. The Labour government of Harold Wilson came to power in 1964 with an ambitious National Plan designed to accelerate Britain's growth rate, but made the blueprint stillborn by refusing to devalue the pound immediately. Instead, Wilson and his chancellor, James Callaghan, imposed austerity measures to keep the pound's exchange rate at $2.80 before giving up the fight in November 1967. Consumers were squeezed so that resources could be diverted to exports, and Wilson \u2013 to his surprise \u2013 lost the 1970 election.</p> <h2><strong>4. The IMF comes to town</strong></h2> <p>In the mid-1970s, Britain suffered a number of unpleasant economic shocks. Ted Heath's 1970-74 Conservative government had caused industrial chaos and left office with the country on a three-day week and inflationary pressure rising. Wilson's second spell in Downing Street saw the advent of stagflation \u2013 rising unemployment and inflation that reached a post-war high of more than 25%. Wilson handed over the reins to Callaghan in March 1976 and the scorching summer that followed saw pressure mounting on sterling, even though it was by now a floating currency. Eventually, the UK had to swallow a package of spending cuts to secure a loan from the IMF. Callaghan lost power, narrowly, to Margaret Thatcher in 1979, but the humiliation of the IMF bailout haunted Labour for more than 15 years.</p> <h2><strong>5.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/business/2012/sep/12/black-wednesday-20-years-pound-erm\" title=\"\"><strong>Black Wednesday</strong></a></h2> <p>The stain of the IMF was only removed from Labour when the Conservatives suffered a disaster of equal magnitude: the inability of the UK to continue with its membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism in the face of wave after wave of speculative selling of the pound. In many of the other crises of the 20th century, the Conservatives were fortunate that they had left office before the full extent of their economic blunders had been exposed. That was true in 1931, 1967 and 1976, when Labour had a rotten inheritance. In 1992, however, the Conservatives' luck ran out. Black Wednesday was followed in 1997 by the biggest electoral defeat suffered by the party in 150 years.</p>",
  "<p>Within minutes of the London markets opening, it was clear the pound was going to come under renewed pressure.</p> <p>There were only three days until the weekend referendum in France on the Maastricht treaty. Unlike the UK, French voters were preparing to decide on plans drawn up by the then president of the European commission, Jacques Delors, for majority voting and closer economic ties. Polls suggested 58% were against.</p> <p>Sterling had joined the EU's longstanding Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in 1990 but had struggled to remain inside its designated floating band. Now circling City speculators saw a chance to attack Britain's currency and wreck a fledgling monetary union that many of them thought would never work.</p> <p>The Italian lira and Spanish peseta were also under pressure, but it was the pound that was grabbing the headlines.</p> <p>George Soros's Quantum Fund led a field of speculators who borrowed UK gilts only to sell them and buy them back later at cheaper prices. They repeated the trick every few minutes, making a profit each time. Soros said later he <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bXNt1ec2FQ\" title=\"\">had made \u00a31bn from selling sterling he didn't own</a>.</p> <p>By mid-morning the selling was so intense that Bank of England officials were buying \u00a32bn of sterling an hour.</p> <p>The prime minister, John Major, was staying in Admiralty house in Whitehall. He was told about the frenzy of selling and convened a meeting of key ministers. He talked about the possibility of interest rate rises beyond the already sky-high 10% and the need for further interventions by the Bank of England. Senior Conservatives Michael Heseltine, Douglas Hurd and Kenneth Clarke joined Major and the chancellor, Norman Lamont, who was on the end of a phone.</p> <p>At 11am they agreed to push up interest rates to 12%.</p> <p>Jim Trott, former chief dealer for the Bank of England, described the day as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJOaYkbwcP0\" title=\"\">\"stunningly expensive\"</a>. He said that behind the scenes he bought more sterling in four hours that day than anybody had before or since. All of his purchases lost value during the day \u2013 and went down even more when the government pulled out.</p> <p>The ERM demanded that currencies stayed within a band set in relation to other currencies in the club. To maintain the currency values relative to each other, countries with the most valuable currencies had to sell their own and buy the weakest. In September the deutschmark was the most powerful currency and sterling the weakest within its band.</p> <p>As Trott tells it, the Bank of England was furiously buying sterling but little was done by the Bundesbank to sell deutschmarks.</p> <p>\"The cavalry were the Bundesbank. We kept on looking over the hill, but there was no dust and there were no hats and no sabres. And then later at the conference call they suddenly didn't speak English, which was extraordinary. So we were kind of stretched on that day,\" he said.

News had filtered through to traders that the head of the German Bundesbank was in favour of Britain devaluing its currency. If this was his view, it explained why he was unwilling to spend money propping up the UK at a higher exchange rate.

Rushdie's memoir Joseph Anton is published on 18 September.</p> <p>\"Tomorrow is huge, and 27 September will be big purely because the new Jamie and new JK Rowling [her first adult novel The Casual Vacancy] will be hitting shelves on the same day. Many other publishers have brought stuff forward to get out of their way \u2013 which is perhaps why Thursday looks so strong,\" said Philip Stone, charts editor at the Bookseller, who is tipping titles including Balding's memoir, Bear Grylls' Survival Guide and William Shawcross's collection of the late Queen Mother's letters as potential surprise hits this Christmas.</p> <p>\"For about three weeks, lots and lots of books will be published,\" said Andre Breedt from book sales monitor Nielsen BookScan. \"Most people aim to get their books out before mid-October at the latest, and there are more than 200 hardbacks published today.\"</p> <p>\"We deliberately went as soon after the Olympics as possible because we knew the timing would be great,\" said Joel Rickett, who is Balding's editor at Penguin. \"We wanted September because October has been such a crowded time over the last couple of years.\"</p> <p>Philip Pullman's take on the Brothers Grimm fairy tales and memoirs from unlikely colleagues Jessie J, Chinua Achebe, Tulisa Contostavlos and Jack Straw will also be jostling for place on 27 September, but the Bookseller is dubbing 11 October as \"Super Thursday\" \u2013 the annual day when the majority of potential Christmas bestsellers are released.

  "<p>Analysts and trade unions have raised concerns over the proposed \u00a329.8bn merger of BAE Systems and EADS, amid concerns that the transaction faces significant regulatory hurdles and will lead to job cuts in the UK if it is successful.</p> <p>Unite, Britain's largest union, said it would seek an urgent meeting with the business secretary, Vince Cable, and the defence secretary, Philip Hammond, in order to secure guarantees over jobs at BAE, Britain's largest manufacturing employer. The combined business will employ 48,000 people in the UK, encompassing a range of manufacturing sites from BAE's shipyards in Govan, Scotland, to the Airbus wing facility in Broughton, north Wales. BAE has cut thousands of jobs in the wake of the government's strategic defence review. It is shedding around 2,000 jobs at its aerospace division and is reviewing its shipbuilding arm, which could result in the loss of more than 1,000 employees at BAE's Portsmouth yard. In May it announced plans to close the historic Armstrong factory in Newcastle upon Tyne as part of a further 620 jobs at its UK business.</p> <p>Ian Waddell, Unite's national officer, said: \"Our first priority will be to safeguard jobs and skills. Any merger will need political approval in Europe and the USA. Questions need to be asked about when the UK government knew about this and what they will do to safeguard jobs.\" He added: \"We will be seeking an urgent meeting with Vince Cable and Philip Hammond and demanding guarantees from the company that a merger will not result in slashing jobs to cut costs. The new company would be the largest manufacturing company in the UK, employing tens of thousands of people in critical defence manufacturing and at Airbus. It is vital that the government ensures these jobs are protected in the UK before approving the merger.\"</p> <p>The Prospect union, which has around 700 members at BAE, said private sector defence contractors had been under \"immense pressure\" due to spending cuts. \"Whether the news of this merger brings reassurance or not for the workers depends on whatever plans for consolidation or growth the merged company will provide. Prospect will be seeking early dialogue with the companies,\" said Mike Clancy, the union's general secretary designate.</p> <p>Sources close to the deal have indicated that the British government has been made fully aware of the implications of the deal with EADS, which is co-controlled by the French and German governments, alongside the Spanish state as a minor shareholder. A government spokesperson said last night that the UK would ensure that the \"public interest\" was protected, but declined to comment on jobs.</p> <p>A source close to the deal played down the concerns. \"It is not about redundancies. Their activities and geographic strengths are largely complimentary. In terms of cost-savings the cuts will be in sourcing and procurement.\" However, the source added that one long-term fear about EADS's UK operations - that the Airbus wing business will move from the UK to Spain - will be eradicated by a successful deal.\" Referring to BAE's proposed 40% shareholding in the combined business, the source said: \"BAE would not take a 40% interest in Airbus only to let those jobs go abroad.\"</p> <p>Lagard\u00e8re, a key shareholder in EADS, said on Thursday it would closely examine any tie-up between the owner of the planemaker Airbus and BAE before accepting any deal. The French media-to-aerospace group, which owns a 7.5% stake in EADS, said: \"The Lagard\u00e8re group intends to ensure that all consequences associated with the proposed EADS NV-BAE Systems plc merger are taken into consideration in determining the terms and conditions of the proposed transaction before it consents to the deal.\"</p> <p>The Lagard\u00e8re holding in EADS is part of a pact designed to maintain the balance between the company's French and German shareholders. The French state also owns 7.5%, while the German carmaker Daimler holds 15%.</p> <p>BAE and EADS have largely complementary businesses, with BAE specialising in defence from the UK nuclear submarine fleet to armoured vehicles for the US army, while EADS is Europe's largest civil aerospace contractor as the owner of Airbus, the Toulouse-based maker of the A380 superjumbo.</p> <p>The regulatory concerns over the deal are twofold: the clearing of any competition hurdles; and receiving clearance from multiple governments that have defence contracts with BAE and EADS. Guy Anderson, a defence analyst at IHS Jane's, said: \"A merger between BAE and EADS is unlikely and wouldn't happen without a lot of trials and tribulations. It would have to navigate onerous regulatory hurdles and sell off many overlapping chunks along the way. If it did go ahead it would create a goliath in terms of scale, putting BAE/EADS ahead of Boeing in revenues, but there is no telling how much of the combined offering would have to be sold off to satisfy regulators.\"</p> <p>However, Anderson said political concerns might be less difficult to overcome, referring to BAE's statement that the UK government would receive a new golden share in the business, which would safeguard its defence interests. \"There is a political dimension. The fact that the UK will keep a stake of sorts in the combined group bodes well and the UK-France defence pact shows that pragmatism can prevail.\" Nick Cunningham, an analyst at Agency Partners, told the Financial Times that the deal would be a \"tough sell\" to the US government, BAE's biggest customer. He said it would be difficult to persuade them \"that they should allow one of their top five prime contractors [BAE] to be part of a European group when one of their major concerns over the years has been about transfer of intellectual property\".</p> <p>One of the biggest rivals of a combined BAE and EADS, Boeing, was relaxed about the deal on Wednesday night despite the raising of regulatory concerns. Jim McNerney, Boeing's chief executive, said: \"I have a pretty deep and abiding faith in our company's strength, so I don't see this as something that is going to threaten us fundamentally.\" McNerney added that BAE and EADS were pursuing a strategy of balancing commercial and military units that Boeing and others were attempting to achieve as well. \"It does reflect a global consolidation that is beginning to happen,\" he said.</p>"
