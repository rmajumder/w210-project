[
  "<p>The 2012 campaign began before the campaign of 2008 had finished. In February of that year, while Barack Obama was still locked in an epic struggle for the Democratic nomination against Hillary Clinton, Mitt Romney summoned his closest allies to a Boston office to work out why his effort to be the Republicans' standard-bearer of 2008 had failed so badly. He handed out a memo he had written about himself, detailing his strengths and weaknesses, assessing his own defeated candidacy as if it were one of the businesses he once assessed as a hotshot management consultant. This was no mere exercise in navel-gazing. Romney was determined to learn the lessons of defeat in 2008 in order to win in 2012.</p> <p>Thus began a long march that ended today. The visible miles came last winter, when Romney trudged through the pig farms of Iowa and the snows of New Hampshire in his search for the Republican nomination. But that followed an invisible primary, an endless round of closed-door fundraisers to fill up a war-chest he hoped would scare off the most fearsome potential rivals.</p> <p>Whether money was the explanation or not, Romney was indeed rewarded by the decision of several big-beast Republicans not to challenge him for the nomination. The New Jersey governor Chris Christie, Indiana's Mitch Daniels and others, including Sarah Palin, skipped the race, leaving the path open for Romney.</p> <p>When ambitious politicians duck a presidential contest, that's usually because they suspect the incumbent will be too hard to dislodge. In the summer of 2011, that looked like the smart decision. For Obama had just done what George W Bush had failed to do: he had removed \u2013 killed \u2013 Osama bin Laden. Many Republicans concluded that, given the US economy was bound to at least slightly improve by November 2012, the scalp of Bin Laden made the president tough to beat.</p> <p>The course for Romney ran anything but smooth. Instead of warming to the former Massachusetts governor as the obvious choice \u2013 a successful businessman who looked like Hollywood's idea of a president \u2013 Republican primary voters seemed ready to fall in love with almost anyone but him. The field of rivals included outlandish characters who seemed absurd to outsiders: pizza magnate Herman Cain, evolution-denying congresswoman Michelle Bachmann, Texas governor Rick Perry, who could not remember which three government departments he planned to shut down. Former McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt said: \"The Republican primary resembled a reality-TV show. All these guys might as well have been living in a tree house with Simon Cowell.\"</p> <p>And yet each of those candidates enjoyed a moment in the sun, a surge in support that made them \u2013 rather than Romney \u2013 the frontrunner. It was as if Republicans were desperate to find someone else to nominate. Accordingly, former senator Rick Santorum and the former House speaker Newt Gingrich won enough states between them to ensure the primary race dragged on.</p> <p>That long, bruising primary battle cost Romney dear, and not just financially (it forced him to spend money defeating his fellow Republicans rather than saving it for the fight against Obama). The greater cost was political.</p> <p>It exposed the future Republican nominee to sustained attack from his own side. The notion of Romney as a ruthless plutocrat, coldly laying off American workers, did not come from the Democrat attack machine. Romney was not seen as embodying the 1% because of the Occupy movement. Rather, that portrait was drawn by Gingrich, who aired an extended commercial, \"When Mitt Romney came to Town\", that tore apart Romney's tenure at the helm of the private equity firm Bain &amp; Co. It depicted him as a corporate raider, willing to shutter factories and shatter working lives if it made him richer. That critique lingered all year, eagerly picked up and advanced by the Democrats. But it originated with the Republicans.</p> <p>Still, the damage of the primaries went deeper. To push aside Santorum, Bachmann and the others, Romney was obliged to adopt positions that would endear him to the Republican faithful \u2013 but which stored up trouble for later. So Romney reversed his previous support for abortion rights and gun control, called on undocumented migrants to \"self-deport\" and rebranded himself from a Massachusetts moderate, who as governor had passed healthcare reform, into the \"severe conservative\" who now promised to repeal \"Obamacare\".</p> <p>Those reverses left him doubly wounded. For one thing, he could now be slammed as a serial flip-flopper, just another politician who believed in nothing and would say whatever it took to be elected. For another, he had been boxed into a series of positions bound to alienate core blocs of the electorate that had long been tough for Republicans to reach \u2013 the young, Latinos and suburban women among them.</p> <p>Sure enough, through the summer months he was on the receiving end of an air assault from Obama, in the form of saturation TV ads in key states, which portrayed Romney as part boardroom vulture, part unprincipled phoney. Obama, who had faced no primary challenge of his own, had the money to do it \u2013 defining Romney before he had a chance to define himself.</p> <p>Yet Romney could not just blame Obama. Much of his trouble was of his own making. He helped colour in the cartoon of himself as an out-of-touch one percenter when he boasted that his wife had \"a couple of Cadillacs\" or when his tax returns \u2013 showing that he paid a meagre 14% \u2013 had to be dragged out of him. In July, he botched an overseas tour meant to boost his credentials as a potential world leader by offending America's most easily pleased ally, Britain, when he suggested the London Olympics could be a flop and by travelling to Jerusalem to offer his view that cultural inferiority might be the cause of Palestinian suffering.</p> <p>What should have been a moment to relaunch his candidacy and make Americans look at him anew \u2013 his party convention in Tampa in August \u2013 also had little effect. His speech was overshadowed by a moment of Dadaist theatre, as Clint Eastwood harangued an empty chair standing in for an imaginary Obama. Romney was on his way to becoming a joke figure.</p> <p>In September, he went from being ridiculed to being hated. A leaked video showed him addressing fellow millionaires at a fundraising event in May, where an unplugged Romney candidly wrote off 47% of the electorate as parasites, non-taxpaying dependents who would never vote Republican because they would not \"take responsibility for their own lives\". Even many on his own side believed it was an act of self-destruction so complete that no candidate could possibly survive it.</p> <p>But Romney had one more chance. The first TV debate in Denver on 3 October was, for many Americans, the first time they had paid close attention to the election. What they saw was an incumbent president who looked exhausted, listless and disengaged. With his head down, his answers sluggish, it seemed he either was too tired to be president or no longer really wanted the job.</p> <p>Romney, by contrast, was spirited and energetic. Above all, he came across as a human being rather than the caricature of Obama propaganda: all he had to do was not seem like a rapacious capitalist bloodsucker and, in an instant, he had broken the core message of the Obama campaign. The immediate bounce that Romney enjoyed in the polls suggested that a small chunk of the electorate, disenchanted with the president, had been waiting to see if the Republican was a plausible replacement. In Denver Romney crossed that threshold.</p> <p>That change revealed what had always been the structural reality of this race. By rights, it should always have been close. Here was an incumbent president who had struggled to lift his approval rating above 50%, who had seen the number of Americans saying the US was on the \"wrong track\" become a majority and, most crucially, had watched as the unemployment rate had remained stuck at 8% for almost his entire presidency, shifting below that figure only a matter of weeks ago. The last president to be re-elected with a jobless percentage that high was Franklin Roosevelt in 1940, in what were rather different circumstances.</p> <p>So the election should never have been a cakewalk for Obama. That it had seemed that way, until Denver, attested to the deeply flawed candidacy of Romney. By raising his game at that first debate, he restored politics to something like normal service.</p> <p>Obama conceded that he had messed up, joked that he had been napping in the first encounter and sharpened up for the next two, where he remained clear, focused and unafraid to confront his opponent: in Denver he had failed even to mention Romney's 47% remark. Now he made it his closing argument.</p> <p>But October was a tough month for the president. He was hobbled by accusations that he had bungled or even deceived the public over the September killing of four US diplomats in Benghazi, an issue unlikely to go away. Still the end of the month brought some unlikely and helpful allies.</p> <p>The first was a former nemesis, Bill Clinton, who in 2008 had dismissed Obama's presidential bid as a \"fairytale\". In the campaign's closing days, Obama let the man they call the big dog run \u2013 as the country's most beloved Democrat grew hoarse making the case for his successor. Obama didn't just exploit Clinton's ability to connect to the white, male blue-collar Americans who remain beyond the current president's reach \u2013 he all but ran on Clinton's record, arguing that \"We know my plan works because we've tried it,\" referring to Clinton's success in the 1990s.</p> <p>The second ally was a genuine surprise. Some pollsters doubt that Superstorm Sandy really made a big difference for Obama, noting that Romney's surge, \"Mittmentum\", had already stalled before the weather changed. But few deny that Obama benefited from the chance to be seen doing the job of president, while Romney was sidelined, and profited especially from the bearhug he received from the Republicans' rising star, Chris Christie. His gushing praise for Obama, and refusal to campaign at Romney's side in Pennsylvania, was precious validation for the president \u2013 and it came at just the right time.</p> <p>And so the two men duelled to the very last, Romney making two campaign convention-breaking stops on election day itself. The campaign had finished, but the politics is anything but over.</p>",
  "<p>It's finally here. Election day. By the end of the night, we'll most likely know who'll be running the country for the next four years. In the blue corner, Barack Obama, rapidly graying but game for another term. In the red corner, Mitt Romney, graying at the temples like a model in a Just For Men commercial and grabbing, desperately, at the job he's been interviewing for for the better part of a decade.</p> <p>Red or blue, regardless of who wins today, one thing is certain: it will take years of work to remedy the harm that has been done to reproductive freedom in the last two years. It will take more than the four years that President Obama would win; and should Romney win, it will take even longer.</p> <p>\"This is not the 1950s,\" <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/08/obama-campaign-airs-planned-parenthood-ad-this-is-131093.html\">argues one Obama ad</a>, warning about the Romney-Ryan positions on abortion, contraception, and Planned Parenthood. The reality is that, in many parts of the country, that time travel has already occurred, and without their help. In large swaths of the United States, abortion has become inaccessible to many women: too expensive, too time-consuming, too intimidating, too <em>hard</em> to access. </p> <p>A second term for Obama would, of course, be far better for American women than would a President Romney and Vice-President Ryan. Romney, after all, has pledged to cut all federal funding to Planned Parenthood on day one of his presidency. And Ryan, who has been far more consistent in his anti-choice policies, favours a national version of the controversial mandatory transvaginal ultrasound law currently in effect in Texas. The official GOP stance on abortion \u2013 the one in its party platform \u2013 is that all abortions should be illegal, with no exceptions in the case of rape. It also declares that constitutional rights ought to be granted at the moment of conception, taking a cue from the too-extreme-for-Mississippi law that would have banned the pill, the IUD, and in vitro fertilisation.</p> <p>A vote for Obama and the Democrats is a vote against that regressive platform and those \"pro-life\" policies that would let women die rather than allow them abortions. But an Obama win alone won't undo the stunning shifts that have occurred in both law and culture in the last few years. In 2011, state legislators proposed 1,100 reproductive rights-related measures, almost all of them aimed at restricting those rights. That was an increase from 2010's 950 measures. Last year, states enacted a record number of abortion restrictions, as <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2012/01/05/endofyear.html\">the vertiginous line on this graph demonstrates</a>.</p> <p>In addition to legislative changes, the last two years have seen a shift in the national discourse around reproductive rights, in which positions that were once considered extreme \u2013 removing rape and incest exceptions from abortion bans \u2013 became mainstream Republican positions. In the space of just a few years, America has become a country in which an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/31/planned-parenthood-bullying-cancer-charity\">organization dedicated to defeating breast cancer pulls funding</a> from clinics that provide breast cancer screenings in addition to abortions and STI tests, and where politicians with presidential aspirations discuss whether or not the birth control pill should be banned.</p> <p>To those unfamiliar with these issues, it may seem as though the right's fixation on rape, the pill, and ultrasounds has sprung out of nowhere. The truth is far more sobering. A generation ago, when my mother was a vocal young feminist, the pro-choice movement made slow advances towards decriminalising contraception and abortion \u2013 advances that culminated, of course, in the success of arguing a case before the US supreme court and securing 1973's historic Wade v Roe ruling. Similarly, the right's desire to throw up as many obstacles to abortion as possible \u2013 mandatory ultrasounds, waiting periods, higher costs, the impossible-to-meet requirements for clinics <a href=\"http://reproductiverights.org/en/project/targeted-regulation-of-abortion-providers-trap\">known as Trap laws</a> \u2013 has been brewing for some time. Nor did the desire to target hitherto uncontroversial forms of contraception like the pill and the IUD spring fully-formed into existence in 2011. Of course, it was largely thanks to GOP electoral victories, fueled by Tea Party enthusiasm and extremism, that those plans were finally turned into policy.</p> <p>Electoral advantages and groundwork aside, it's my belief that the misogynistic hostility towards women's bodily autonomy, the desire to turn back the clock on gender equality, is part of a reaction to the election of the nation's first African-American president. The sense that America has rolled dangerously far down an undesirable road has not only brought out the hideous racism that until now had mostly lain dormant and covert, but has also fed a desire to undo what the left sees as progress toward gender equality and what conservatives view as the dismantling of everything they hold dear. The re-election of President Obama will, in all likelihood, serve to deepen that sentiment on the right.</p> <p>This is not to argue against re-electing Obama: when you're pissing off America's racists and misogynists, it means you're doing something right. It is simply to warn that a win for Obama will mean a continuation, and even a worsening, of the cultural and legislative trends we've witnessed in the last few years.</p> <p>Regaining the ground lost, and bringing the national discourse back to where it was before this madness began, will take an enormous amount of hard work. It will also take time \u2013 far longer than the four years Obama would have in office. Yes, rights can be stripped away in one or two congressional sessions, but restoring them, and crawling out of this horrendous cultural quagmire, will take many more than that.</p> <p>A victory for Obama will shield America from a president and vice-president who will are eager to appoint anti-Roe justices, and who will be delighted to see abortion and contraception made inaccessible to even more American women. It will prevent the elevation of Paul Ryan, a man who in effect believes, as so many others in his party do, that rape is \"just another method of conception\".</p> <p>Even if Obama wins, those of us who care about reproductive rights will have a hard road ahead of us. No, this is not the 1950s, but when it comes to reproductive freedom, an Obama victory alone will not bring us magically back to 2012. It will not guarantee us a just and progressive future. Regardless of who wins Tuesday, we will have to fight for that future. Again.</p>",
  "<p>It's almost 50 years since Harold Wilson was described as the first British Prime Minister to understand the importance of television. He would probably have boggled had he seen the reach and variety of media on offer in 2012, and it's that media which is set to define the political lives of both American Presidential candidates as they wait to find out who's going to enter or remain in the White House in January.</p> <p>The incumbent President Barack Obama has had the edge in social media since he started engaging through Twitter whilst still a candidate in 2007. Media consultant Alan Stevens from Mediacoach.co.uk gives him a lot of credit for it. \"[Obama] has gathered 21.5 million Twitter followers, whereas his challenger has fewer than two million,\" he says. \"In addition, he (or his campaign team) is more active, having so far delivered over 400 tweets in this campaign to a mere 16 from the Romney camp. Obama scores more highly on YouTube too, with 21 campaign videos to Romney's 10.\"</p> <p>Social media is normally a two-way channel, but in this election it seems not to be so. \"What's noticeable about both candidates is the use of social media almost exclusively as a broadcast channel,\" says Stevens. \"Neither has very much engagement with their followers and Facebook friends, and retweets and response to messages are as rare as a friendly word between them. It would have made good sense to create at least some opportunities for engagement by responding to some messages, giving material for those personal stories in speeches that politicians covet.\"</p> <p>Mary Askew, <a href=\"http://maryaskewmedia.co.uk\">media commentator</a> and lecturer and a former political editor for the BBC, suggests this is the first American election in which social media has played such a prominent part in spite of Obama's use of Twitter in the previous one, and suggests this will help engage younger voters. She sees significance in the character of the communications: \"The campaigns teams have been using social media for much more than pictures from campaign trial or pleas for donations and volunteers \u2014 they have been using them to paint a picture of the candidates' home lives, trying to depict family men with a sense of humour and a life outside of politics,\" she says. \"We've learnt about the White House veg plot from Michelle Obama's Pinterest site, and seen pictures of the Mitt Romney having takeaway pizza with some of his grandchildren on Ann Romney's site.\"</p> <p>It's not quite Twitter and 'what I had for breakfast' but it's not far. \"From Spotify we've learnt about the candidates' favourite music, and with Twitter we're able to know exactly where the candidates are, and what they are doing,\" comments Askew. \"The New York Times even reported that Mitt Romney's bodyguard posted a picture of the candidate's family playing Jenga before a debate.\"</p> <p>The mainstream media remains divided. In the US the laws regulating the UK, which state that a television broadcaster may not be politically biased, don't apply. This opens the door to the obvious 'usual candidates' declaring their hands; there was never a possibility of Fox News supporting anyone but a right winger, for example. \"Both camps have claimed media bias against their guy,\" says Stevens. \"As usual, that means that the coverage is fairly balanced. Naturally, some media outlets such as Fox News make their preference clear. They don't sway voters at all, simply reinforcing entrenched views about either Romney or the lack of balance of Fox News, depending where your loyalties are. Overall, both candidates are media-savvy, but neither is doing enough to pull ahead of the other.\"</p> <p>Indeed there is some debate about just how important this media stuff is to the candidates anyway. Askew isn't sure just yet: \"More people must know more about the presidential campaigns than ever before, but what I'm fascinated by is what, if any, impact all this effort will have at the ballot box,\" she says. \"If you can predict an election by how many people like your Facebook page or follow you on Twitter then Obama is a shoe-in \u2014 more than 31 million people follow him on Facebook. But this is an American election first, nobody knows the influence of social media yet. What is certain is that nobody is taking any chances.\"</p> <p>In terms of what actually matters to people when they hear it, Romney's gaffes have undoubtedly helped Obama. His implied mistrust of the UK's handling of the Olympics has been overstated; the American public has no particular reason to worry about what he may or may not have said about the prospects of a remote country on another continent running the Games. He was particularly memorable in the televised debates insisting that Obama had taken two weeks to describe the Libyan attack on Benghazi as an 'act of terror'; in spite of the correction (the President had used that phrase the morning after) he repeated the allegation.</p> <p>Other than that moment TV played a less significant part than unofficial sources. Romney's famous quote about 47% of Americans paying no tax and being part of a dependency culture leaked online rather than being an 'official version'. The debates themselves were pretty tame. \"Barack Obama was asleep though the first debate and probably edged the other two, without landing a knockout blow,\" suggests Stevens. \"These days, candidates are so well prepped for head-to-head debates that a big win is unlikely, which makes the first debate look even more extraordinary, and one can only assume that the Obama camp underestimated their opponent.</p> <p>\"Neither candidate delivered a killer soundbite, which suggests either a lack of imagination from their teams, or an awareness that TV debates don't sway many undecided voters. I think that was a mistake, since campaigns can turn on a pithy, memorable phrase.\"</p> <p>In some ways that's what's been missing from this election campaign. In the 1990s Bill Clinton became President on the strength of the word \"Change\"; during the 1980s Ronald Reagan became President at least partly through taking advantage of his considerable charisma in front of the camera.</p> <p>It's possible that the current election is going to be the first in many years in which neither candidate has really grasped what Harold Wilson understood some 50 years ago: the importance of television and, in the early part of this century, the wider media.</p>",
  "<p>Like her husband, Michelle Obama must wait until the results are in to find out whether she has another four years in Washington or gets to leave the White House and reclaim her life.</p> <p>It's hard to say which option she'd prefer because if the last four years have been tough for Barack Obama, they haven't exactly been a cakewalk for the first lady. But whatever the outcome of today's election the next four years will be easier for her. In either case they could be very different.</p> <p>Michelle Obama has never hidden her ambivalence about moving from Chicago to Washington. Even in this year's speech to the DNC she brought it up.</p> <p>\"Our life before moving to Washington was filled with simple joys,\" she said. \"Saturdays at soccer games, Sundays at grandma's house, and a date night for Barack and me with either dinner or a movie because as an exhausted mom, I couldn't stay awake for both. \u2026 And the truth is, I loved the life we had built for our girls.\"</p> <p>The daughters of the self-described mom-in-chief are older now \u2013 one of them is in high school. They are more independent. They need her less. She has more time to do what she wants. And because this would be her husband's last term in the White House, she could push the boundaries of the role of first lady if she so chose.</p> <p>Win or lose she has more options. Here are some for her to consider.</p> <h2>If Barack Obama wins</h2> <p><strong>She could change her issues.</strong> In her husband's first term, her first focus was on military families, but combat forces are already home from Iraq and are due to be out of Afghanistan within the next two years. While she can remain involved in the lives of military families and the problems they face post combat, this doesn't need to be a priority. Nor does obesity, which was a safe option for a first lady who didn't want to make waves. She can remain concerned with it, but as her heart never seemed to be in it, she should put it on the back burner (no pun intended).</p> <p><strong>She should be more vocal on behalf of women. </strong>As a lawyer, and a woman of eloquence she would be an antidote to the grey-haired men of the Republican party. She could become first lady in more than just name. If she speaks out on subjects like pay equity, childcare, even contraception people will listen. She has the power and the spotlight to make a real difference for women in and out of the workforce. An added bonus is, that if she did, it would add considerably to her husband's legacy.</p> <p><strong>She should position herself for a career after the White House. </strong>She will have four years to consider and prepare for whatever it is she wants to do next. By the time the Obamas leave Washington Malia will be headed to college and Sasha will be in high school. Michelle Obama could follow the Clinton model and head into politics herself, but she doesn't seem drawn to the political arena unless it's in a role like ambassador to the UN. But she'd have the time to try out a few ideas and make some relationships for the future.</p> <p><strong>She should write a book.</strong>No more gardening. But maybe she could put together a parenting book based on her unique perspective. After all she is the mom-in-chief, and there is the precedent of It Takes a Village. She'd get an enormous advance and the book tour would give her a platform to promote her ideas of child-rearing and family values.</p> <h2>If Barack Obama loses</h2> <p><strong>She should immediately reclaim her own professional achievements and get a job.</strong> If the family moves back to Chicago she could explore local community-based professional options. That seems to be where she was happiest before. She could even take those options national. There's no reason why she can't pick up where she left off but with more of a megaphone.</p> <p><strong>She should NOT host a talk show.</strong> The talk in Hollywood is that the former first lady could be the secret to daytime TV gold. They say she is so telegenic (and she is) she could be the next Oprah. But taking that path is selling herself short. She should confine herself to being a guest not a host.</p> <p><strong>She should re-embrace her alma mater.</strong> Obama admits that her Princeton years were not her happiest, but it's time she got over it. University officials have made at least six direct overtures to her to return to Princeton or speak at Princeton-affiliated events. (She even declined to attend her 25th reunion in May 2010.) In all but one case, she has rebuffed their advances, often citing a busy schedule, according the The Princetonian. Her Ivy League (don't forget Harvard law school) education is something she should be proud of and she should realize what an inspiration it could be to other women from less than privileged backgrounds.</p> <p><strong>She should continue writing op-eds.</strong> She wrote her first one last month, (\"Do children who go to an understaffed, crumbling school truly have a fair shot at success? If a family has a son or daughter born with a genetic disease, should they have to fight day and night with insurance companies just to get the insurance coverage they need?\") It was good. She has a voice and anyone will publish her. It's an easy way to keep her profile high and use her influence.</p> <h2>In either case</h2> <p><strong>She should take more risks.</strong> She has enormous influence, and nothing to lose. She should be more outspoken and more passionate about the causes she believes in. She should ditch the mom-in-chief title and revert to what she was before her husband ran for the White House \u2013 a bright well-educated, articulate, accomplished woman, inspirational in her own right.</p>",
  "<p>A prison officer shot dead in an ambush last week represented \"those things completely the opposite of the murderous thugs and bloodthirsty criminals who took his life\", a minister at his funeral on Tuesday told mourners.</p> <p>David Black was described as a man of kindness, committed to peace in Northern Ireland. The 52-year-old was murdered by Republican dissident paramilitaries in an attack on his car along the M1 motorway outside Portadown last Thursday.</p> <p>Cookstown in County Tyrone came to a standstill at lunchtime as shops and businesses closed, and hundreds turned out in the town the centre to pay their respects.</p> <p>Up to 20 prison officers in uniform flanked Black's coffin as it was taken from the family's home following a private service to Molesworth Presbyterian church. There was also a discreet security presence, with sniffer dogs deployed to search the church grounds.</p> <p>Mourners included the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Matt Baggott, the director of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, Sue McAllister, the first minister of Northern Ireland, Peter Robinson, and the leader of the SDLP, Alasdair McDonnell. The deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, is understood to have offered to attend the funeral, but the family requested that no members of Sinn Fein should turn up. McGuinness is understood to have expressed his desire to respect the family's wishes.</p> <p>Condemning those responsible for killing Black, who was a regular attender at Molesworth Presbyterian church in Cookstown, the Rev Tom Greer said: \"It is so terrible that evil men with such hatred in their hearts should rob us of a great man like David with love and kindness in his heart.\"</p> <p>He said many prisoners who had been guarded by Black told how his help and advice had turned their lives around.</p> <p>\"David viewed his work as something that was meant to improve society. He wanted those who came into prison to leave as changed men,\" Greer said.</p> <p>He also paid tribute to the murdered officer's widow, Yvonne, and his children Kyle and Kyra for urging that there be no retaliation over the killing.</p> <p>\"They have determined not to seek revenge or to encourage it in anyone else. They long to see justice done, but will not meet other people's bitterness and hatred with any of their own. They set an example to us all,\" he added.</p> <p>Three men who were arrested following the fatal shooting have all been released unconditionally.</p> <p>David Black was the 30th prison officer murdered by paramilitaries since the early 1970s. He was buried after a private ceremony in Kildress parish cemetery.</p> <p>As the funeral was taking place, several hundred people turned up for a vigil at Belfast city hall organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. A lone piper played a lament and Black's killers were denounced from the platform by the trade union movement.</p>",
  "<p>Black Sabbath have recorded six songs for a new studio album produced by Rick Rubin \u2013 their first with original singer Ozzy Osbourne since 1978's Never Say Die!, and also featuring Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler, the original guitarist and bass player.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfP1YENOZIE&amp;feature=player_embedded\" title=\"\">an interview with Blairing Out</a>, Iommi said: \"We've written the 15 songs and we've played them all, but now at the moment we're recording them. We're about six tracks in at the moment.\"</p> <p>However, he said, there was no chance of original drummer Bill Ward rejoining the fold. \"We'll always have a heart for Bill, but I think it's gone past that now, because it's gone on so long I don't see that happening at the moment.\"</p> <p>What's \"gone on so long\" appears to be the disagreement between Ward and the rest of the band after he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/feb/06/black-sabbath-reunion-bill-ward\" title=\"\">excluded from this summer's headline show at Download festival</a> \"I [can't] help feeling some resentment towards the failure to reach an agreement, the failure to remember where we came from, the failure to be as brothers, as we once were,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/16/bill-ward-black-sabbath-reunion\" title=\"\">Ward said before the festival</a>. \"To be clear, I'm not blaming the other guys or finding any faults with them. I would think it can't be easy for them either, but this situation is just really sad.\"</p> <p>However, the news that Black Sabbath have made it back into the studio will delight fans, given that earlier this year 64-year-old Iommi was diagnosed with early-stage lymphoma.

But we also know that only a minority can be adopted.\"</p> <p>Mansuri, who will address the Lords select committee on adoption legislation led by Lady Butler-Sloss, said ministers increased their popularity by highlighting difficulties in adoption but did not take responsibility: \"They set the policies and release the resources. What Gove said is an example of adoption as a political football, of the misrepresentation and distortion that gets people's backs up.\"</p> <p>The changes relating to race and adoption had the backing of significant stakeholders, many of whom sat on a working group led by Gove's adoption tsar Martin Narey. But there is continuing disquiet among some minority social workers and activists who say local authorities will feel less obliged to find the most advantageous match. This summer, around 60 people met to protest that ministers were downgrading the importance of race and heritage in the adoption process. The Race Equality Foundation subsequently sent a critique of ministers' adoption intervention to Butler-Sloss's select committee.</p> <p>Sally Baffour, a black adoptive mother and a former government adviser who was for six years a trustee of the British Association for Adoption and Fostering, said: \"There are going to be cavalier decisions made. If it is possible to make a quick match and take the pressure off, why keep looking for a better one?\"</p> <p>Baffour, who sits on adoption panels, said trans-racial adoptions are hard to get right. \"Race and heritage and culture are important, but ministers seem totally dismissive. A lot of people think the repercussions are going to be very damaging.\"</p> <p>Marlene Ellis, a black Londoner raised for 18 years by white foster parents in the home counties, said the complexities should not be underestimated. \"It is impossible to come out really clear and comfortable about who you are in a society that still has very clear classifications for race and culture,\" she said. \"My parents did the best they could do but there are subtle things that happen that erode your confidence. My real memory is loneliness; of not knowing.\"But minsters can say, with justification, that some social work professionals and trans-racial adoptees fully back the government's stance on race and adoption. Jo Bonnett, a black police officer raised in rural Leicestershire and east London by white English adoptive parents, is one of them. \"I didn't find it a negative experience,\" she says \"I think I was very lucky. I had an older brother who was their birth son; a brilliant childhood and fantastic friends. My challenges came at 17, but when you get to that age, and have been brought up in a loving household, you are strong enough to deal with racism or any issues you might have.\"She said the benefits greatly outweigh the drawbacks. \"I don't think race matters in adoption as long as you have loving parents and have all the things a child needs.\"</p> <p>Bonnett, 40, said she and her husband, who is white, tried themselves to adopt a black child. \"But we were told the child must be mixed race. Ridiculous!\"</p> <p>The figure most directly identified with the adoption review was Tim Loughton, the coalition's first children's minister, but he lost his job in the reshuffle. He was replaced by Edward Timpson. Loughton will also appear before the Lords select committee as will officials from the the College of Social Work. Having conducted a survey, the College of Social Work will say ministers are right to speed the adoption process but must be careful to ensure that haste doesn't lead to bad decisions and adoption breakdowns.</p> <p>Nearly 90% of social workers polled say adoptions take too long. And more than half think it is right to tackle delays caused by caused by 'excessive emphasis' on an ethnic match between the child and its adoptive parents. But the college will tell peers that most do not feel adequately trained to deal with adoption. Alongside the parliamentary discussions, there will be initiatives incoming days to raise the profile of adoption as part of National Adoption Week.</p> <p>A Department for Education spokeswoman said the government's motivation was to \"make it as easy as possible for people to foster and adopt so that more children in care find loving and stable homes.\" She added: \"We have also introduced measures to tackle delay, sharpen accountability, and hold the local authorities slowest to act to account.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2012. The original said Edward Timpson was adopted. That is not the case.</p>"
