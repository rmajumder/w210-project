  "<p>A Labour-led alliance of entrepreneurs, academics and trade unionists will be announced on Mondayin an initiative to tackle youth unemployment in Britain's 10 worst-hit areas.</p> <p>Liam Byrne, the shadow work and pensions secretary, will tell the conference that the group, Labour's Youth Jobs Taskforce, will monitor government policy. It will also aim to help MPs and councils set up job summits and create a network of councillors to swap ideas on employing young jobless people.</p> <p>The body, which will also include an executive from the accountancy giant KPMG, is meant to show Labour putting forward a serious plan to tackle unemployment, in contrast to the government's policy which has been criticised for being lacklustre by a committee of MPs. Byrne will speak to conference live from a youth jobs summit in Manchester to launch the taskforce.</p> <p>\"Britain's youth jobs crisis can't wait for a Labour government in 2015. We have to take action today. So Labour's leaders from across the country are today uniting in a new drive to give the best thing we can give to our young people: a chance to work,\" he will say.</p> <p>\"The Tory-led government's measures have failed. Across the UK, it's now Labour leading the fight-back against the curse of youth unemployment. Our task is to make sure the best ideas anywhere become Labour's approach everywhere.\"</p> <p>It is a year since youth unemployment rose above a million for the first time since records began. Around 40% of unemployed people in the UK are aged 16-25.</p> <p>Labour has accused ministers of a U-turn for scrapping the previous government's future jobs fund and then introducing its own youth jobs initiative, the youth contract.</p> <p>Whitehall officials point out that the future jobs fund placed people in the public sector or community organisations and that they did not always learn marketable skills.</p> <p>By contrast, the youth contract is aimed at private sector opportunities. The aim is to match people up with employers who might go on to offer them real jobs.</p> <p>The drawback is that it depends on the willingness of private sector companies to step forward.</p> <p>Byrne will chair the taskforce which will also include Alan Buckle, the global deputy chairman of KPMG, the chief executive of Daylesford Organic, and representatives from Unison and the TUC.</p> <p>Prof Paul Gregg, a former member of the CBI's steering committee, has also agreed to join, Labour said.</p> <p>The launch comes as Labour local authorities demand new powers from the government under the City Deal programme to tackle youth unemployment. Some councils have prepared bids to the \u00a3100m Big Lottery Talent Match fund designed to finance youth jobs initiatives.</p> <p>In June, the Cabinet Office and the Department for Work and Pensions calculated the 20 worst areas for youth unemployment in the country, all of them in the north of England, Scotland and Wales.</p>",
  "<p>The White House has defended its ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, after criticism from Republicans determined to exploit the Obama administration's shifting position on the attack in Libya that killed the US ambassador.</p> <p>David Plouffe, a senior White House adviser, said on Sunday that Barack Obama had \"100% confidence\" in Rice, who initially described the Benghazi attack as a spontaneous assault in the wake of anti-US protests elsewhere in the Middle East.</p> <p>Late last week the White House began calling it a planned terrorist attack by forces who may have been linked to al-Qaida, prompting criticism of Rice from senior Republican figures.</p> <p>On Friday, Peter King, chairman of the House of Representatives homeland security committee, said Rice should resign for \"misinforming\" the American public in the interviews she gave in the aftermath of the attack. \"Somebody has to pay the price for this,\" he told CNN.</p> <p>Republicans sense an opportunity in what they regard as the White House's faltering reaction to the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi on 11 September, when a mob set fire to the building, killing the ambassador, Chris Stevens.</p> <p>After initially describing the attack as opportunistic in the wake of protests against an internet video made in the US that was offensive to Muslims, the White House changed tack. Speaking to reporters on the campaign trail on Thursday, White House spokesman Jay Carney described it as \"terrorism\".</p> <p>Libya's president, Mohamed Magariaf, has also blamed \"al-Qaida elements\" for the death of Stevens and three other Americans working for the state department.</p> <p>The issue is sensitive to the Obama campaign, which has made the killing of Osama bin Laden and the president's determination to beat al-Qaida a central plank of his re-election effort. Also, any suggestion that groups linked to al-Qaida were gaining ground in Libya would be a blow to the US-backed international coalition that mounted air strikes which eventually led to the downfall of the former Libyan leader, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.</p> <p>In a statement on Friday, Shawn Turner, the director of public affairs for national intelligence, clarified the position. He said: \"In the immediate aftermath, there was information that led us to assess that the attack began spontaneously following protests earlier that day at our embassy in Cairo. We provided that initial assessment to executive branch officials and members of Congress, who used that information to discuss the attack publicly and provide updates as they became available. Throughout our investigation, we continued to emphasize that information gathered was preliminary and evolving.\"</p> <p>A lack of information about the circumstances of the attack has left open the question of whether it was planned in a few hours, to take advantage of a spontaneous anti-US protest in Egypt against the anti-Muslim video, or whether it was planned over longer term to mark the 11th anniversary of al-Qaida's 9/11 attacks on the US.</p> <p>In the NBC interview on Sunday, Plouffe defended the change of explanation for the Benghazi attack. \"I think now based on the recommendations and the investigation of the intelligence community, they made the decision to conclude that this was a terrorist attack. In the days after, that was not clear. This was a very fast-moving period of time \u2026 we provided information that we received from the intelligence community as we got it.\"</p> <p>Plouffe insisted that Rice had the full backing of the administration. Asked by Meet the Press host David Gregory if Barack Obama had \"100% confidence in her\", he said: \"Absolutely. She's done a terrific job for this country, for this administration.\"</p> <p>The response to the attack has rapidly become an election issue in the past few days. On Friday, the former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who sought the Republican nomination for the presidency in 2008, accused the White House of a cover-up.</p> <p>Speaking to Fox News, Giuliani said: \"This is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the most transparent in history. And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of cover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four Americans.\"</p>",
  "<p>Union leaders are seeking urgent talks with Biffa, in the latest move to protect jobs and services at the debt-laden waste management group.</p> <p>The move comes as the company, which has contracts with numerous local councils, is reported to be on the verge of falling into the hands of 76 banks and financial institutions, which are owed \u00a31.1bn by Biffa's owners, Montagu Private Equity and Global Infrastructure Partners.</p> <p>Brian Strutton, national secretary for public services at the GMB union, said: \"Biffa is a fundamentally sound business crippled by the greed of private equity owners. The core waste and recycling operation can emerge stronger without the millstone of debt around its neck.\"</p> <p>In August, a consortium of Chinook Urban Mining, a London recycling specialist, the private equity investor Clearbrook Capital and the American bank JP Morgan bid \u00a3520m for the group.</p> <p>A Biffa spokeswoman said: \"The company is undertaking a well-managed, planned restructuring process and working closely with its lenders.\"</p>"
