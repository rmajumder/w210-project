  "<p><a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/september-2012/statistical-bulletin.html\" title=\"\">Unemployment</a> in Britain stands at 2.59 million. That may be mercifully lower than many experts might expect it to be, given the stagnant state of the economy. But it still means a million more people are now searching for a job than six years ago, before the credit crisis struck. Another 1.4 million say they are working part-time because they can't find a full-time post; and a generation of young people faces a grim struggle to join the 21st-century workplace.</p> <p>Yet the coalition's priority is to cap the amount employers can be forced to pay out in unfair dismissal claims. Vince Cable \u2013 the caring face of the coalition, to the extent that it has one \u2013 announced on Friday that rewards will be limited to 12 months' salary. In principle, there's nothing wrong with the Department for Business giving recession-hit firms more certainty about their potential liabilities. But the real sadness about Cable's latest intervention is the signal it sends about the coalition's priorities during the deepest slump in living memory.</p> <p>This is a government in the grip of a clapped-out ideology, as out of date as the suits from Margaret Thatcher's 1980s wardrobe <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/30/margaret-thatchers-suits-for-sale\" title=\"\">that recently came up for auction</a>: it's what Chuka Umunna, Labour's shadow business secretary, calls \"retro economics\", and it's wrong-headed, for four reasons.</p> <p>First, it is nonsense to suggest that during the weakest upturn in living memory, when much of the eurozone \u2013 our biggest trading partner \u2013 is on the floor, the US is stalling, and British households are hamstrung by the debts from the boom years, what's holding firms back from hiring new workers is a bit of red tape.</p> <p>It was this idea, still rife on the Tory right, that motivated venture capitalist Adrian Beecroft's report on employment law, commissioned by David Cameron earlier this year. Yet America's ultra-flexible labour market is stuck in the doldrums; while Germany, where employers face far more rules and regulations, has halved its unemployment rate since the peak of the crisis.</p> <p>Beecroft's own report acknowledges the fact that his recommendations are based more on anecdote and hunch than sound economic analysis. \"Quantifying the loss of jobs arising from the burden of regulation, and the economic value of those jobs, is an impossible task,\" he says. \"How many more businesses would there be, how many people would they employ, how many more people would existing businesses employ, how profitable would all these businesses be? Who knows?\"</p> <p>Yet the Tory right continue to seize on his proposals, and others like them, as a way to unleash the \"wealth creators\", and kick-start growth.</p> <p>Second, even if the argument that cutting red tape boosts jobs had firmer economic foundations, it's hard to see it as relevant to the UK. Analysis by the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/\" title=\"\">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> suggests that only the US and Canada make it easier for firms to fire their staff.</p> <p>Third, though business confidence will have to be an important factor in restoring economic growth, consumers' mood matters too. Hard-pressed employees are hardly likely to feel more secure if they are told that it's now easier still for them to lose their jobs.</p> <p>Finally, it's one legacy of the crisis of the past five years that a growing number of economists are beginning to argue that not only does slashing red tape not create new jobs, but increasing workers' bargaining power might actually help to generate recovery. <a href=\"http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2011/04/08/inequality-and-growth/\" title=\"\">The International Monetary Fund</a> \u2013 hardly a hotbed of lefties \u2013 has made a link between widening income inequality and stagnating growth. The <a href=\"http://unctad.org/en/Pages/Home.aspx\" title=\"\">United Nations Conference on Trade and Development</a> has gone further, and urged western governments to adopt a full-blown incomes policy \u2013 even more retro than Mrs T's shoulder-padded power suits \u2013 to boost the living standards of low-paid workers, and stoke domestic demand.</p> <p>Those at the bottom of the pay scale, the argument goes, are more likely to spend what they earn \u2013 and create demand \u2013 than super-rich business owners whose wealth leaches away offshore, or piles up unspent. The idea remains taboo even on the left; but it may be that re-regulating the jobs market, not deregulating it, is a surer route to economic success.</p> <p>Yet in a time of deep anxiety, the coalition's best plan is to cut the recompense for staff who have been chucked on the scrap heap through no fault of their own.</p>",
  "<p>What do David Beckham, Alexi Lalas and Rezart Taci share? All three, the first two in tandem, have been linked with mooted buy-outs of M\u00e1laga.</p> <p>Whereas Taci, an Albanian oil magnate, reportedly held talks with the La Liga side's Qatari owner earlier this summer, recent days have been suffused with speculation that Beckham and Lalas aim to relocate a partnership forged at LA Galaxy to southern Spain. Spokesmen for Sheikh Abdullah Al-Thani have reiterated that the man who bought M\u00e1laga only two years ago has no intention of selling but the truth remains opaque.</p> <p>Conspiracy theories abound as wealthy Zenit St Petersburg, Hulk et al, prepare to visit La Rosaleda \u2013 M\u00e1laga's home was built on the site of abundant rose bushes \u2013 on Champions League duty on Tuesday. Many fans of a club popular with the Costa del Sol's sizeable British expat population maintain it is no coincidence that the sheikh's hefty investment waned after he encountered difficulties in obtaining planning permission for a \u00a3400m redevelopment of the port of Marbella.</p> <p>M\u00e1laga rebut such suggestions, claiming that the football business is simply being \"restructured\" to comply with Uefa's financial fair play rules. This does not quite explain why players are still owed wages or why a club who had just enjoyed their best season needed urgently to sell Santi Cazorla to Arsenal for \u00a312m. M\u00e1laga have until 30 September to reboot their finances or explain to Uefa why they remain in debt to players, rival clubs and the taxman. Concerns emerged last January when the club were banned from making signings due to unpaid instalments on transfer fees; then, in May, Fernando Hierro, the former Real Madrid luminary, resigned as technical director.</p> <p>How Manuel Pellegrini, M\u00e1laga's Chilean coach and another former Real Madrid star, must envy Luciano Spalletti, Zenit's coach. Spalletti's net transfer market outlay this summer was nearly \u00a383m, making him the second highest European spender after Paris St-Germain's Carlo Ancelotti.</p> <p>More significantly Spalletti accomplished the unprecedented feat of persuading two leading players in their prime to swap the balmy climes of Portugal for St Petersburg's relentless, vitamin D deficient chill and a team whose average home attendance was a modest 20,000 last season. Within the course of 24 hours Spalletti signed Hulk from Porto for \u00a340m and Axel Witsel, the Belgium midfielder, from Benfica for \u00a324m.</p> <p>While the lavish salaries on offer at a club underwritten by Gazprom \u2013 the world's largest extractor of natural gas \u2013 constituted a key attraction, so too did Zenit's unashamed ambition to win the Champions League.</p> <p>The shifting topography of European football's power bases is such that it is not beyond possibility that Spalletti's Russians could find themselves up against Paris St-Germain in next spring's final at Wembley. Considering that Ancelotti's chart-topping net spend this summer was nearly \u00a3127m \u2013 Leonardo, PSG's sporting director described it as \"a studious window\" \u2013 few would bet against a French finalist. Yet while most eyes were focused firmly on the arrivals of Sweden's Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Brazil's Thiago Silva from Milan, it went almost unnoticed that PSG have invested the best part of \u00a35m in their women's football team.</p> <p>That sort of sum is small change to the Qatar Investment Authority \u2013 the owner of a PSG side who begin their Champions League group campaign at home to Dynamo Kiev on Tuesday.</p> <p>The logic behind the Qatari investment in the Parc des Princes' female team is that the women footballers may be better equipped to secure TV coverage in the United States and thereby begin the process of brand PSG \"cracking America\".</p> <p>With Uefa's financial fair play regulations, under which clubs are supposed to become self-financing, due for enforcement in 2014 such initiatives have assumed heightened importance. So, too, have French tax laws. Should Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the president, implement proposals to impose a 75% tax on incomes in excess of \u00a41m (\u00a3800,000 a year), it is thought that PSG would be the only club capable of paying such a levy on its players' behalf.</p> <p>This could see many of the 150 top-earning players emigrating to more generous habitats, with Russia, and Zenit in particular, an increasingly appealing destination.</p> <p>Their absorbing involvement in a European footballing \"beauty contest\" with Abu Dhabi underwritten Manchester City should not blind PSG's Qatari backers to the threat posed by Gazprom's Hulk-propelled toy.</p> <p>After spending decades believing that West invariably trumps East, some of the world's top football talents are changing direction.</p>"
