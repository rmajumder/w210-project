  "<p>If a single word dominates the recent white paper, <a href=\"http://caringforourfuture.dh.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Caring for our future</a>, it is \"quality\". The word is dotted throughout the white paper and an entire chapter is devoted to the concept.</p> <p>The white paper stresses the government's desire to drive continuous quality improvement in services. The health secretary, Andrew Lansley, for example, states in the foreword that \"the quality of care and support that people receive can vary considerably \u2026 And all too often, the system only grinds into action in response to a crisis, rather than acting quickly to prevent one.\"</p> <p>The white paper outlines a number of initiatives that seek to raise standards and quality. The government reinforces its belief in a market-based approach to continuous improvement, seeing informed and empowered service users (using their own money or a proxy such as a personal budget or direct payment) making choices which drive up quality and/or force poorer providers to improve or exit.</p> <p>But the key question is whether or not the initiatives in the white paper amount to a coherent strategy for quality. The truth is that most do not require legislation to be progressed and several have already been announced or are in train. For example, the role of regulator the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is reconfirmed as being one of ensuring (and if necessary enforcing) compliance with essential standards of quality and safety.</p> <p>So the white paper contains few completely new ideas and, as such, the aspirations for better quality care are unlikely to be easily met by the proposals it contains.</p> <p>The fundamental problem is that the government fails to appreciate that driving continuous quality improvement requires, among other things, a consistent definition of high quality around which all parties can coalesce. There is also huge potential for the public to be confused about the roles of the key agencies in relation to quality.</p> <p>The government's role is to set the overarching policy and legal framework, provide funding, and ensure accountability. But while a consumerist approach \u2013 that is, giving users of social care and their families a greater role in the choice and standard of their care \u2013 is to be welcomed, it is short-sighted if it then means the government appears to play less of a strategic leadership role. Leadership in this respect is critical; each of the recent Winterbourne reports underlines this. But the message, loud and clear, is that it is for others to both assess and drive quality above the compliance level.</p> <p>For example, far from rationalising the number of organisations concerned with social care quality, there appears to be a trend towards increasing them. So, as well as established bodies like local councils, the CQC, Skills for Care, Scie (the Social Care Institute for Excellence) and TLAP (Think Local Act Personal), there are plans to involve or extend the remits of NHS Choices, Nice, HQIP (Healthcare Quality Improvement Programme) and Healthwatch. Only the government can address this issue of overlapping roles \u2013 not least because it controls the purse strings and the legislation governing many of them.</p> <p>There are organisations like Scie whose exclusive focus is social care and yet the task \u2013 and presumably funding \u2013 of developing a \"library of social care standards\" is given to Nice, a \"clinical\" excellence body. Then the government plans to invest in developing an ambitious web-based data portal on providers' quality profiles which it claims will \"support the production of independent quality ratings that are easy to understand\", though it's not clear how this is going to happen.</p> <p>Too many cooks spoil the broth, as the adage goes. I wonder who at the DH thinks it is a good idea to involve so many different and diverse agencies in delivering its quality strategy?</p> <p>Furthermore, the government will support and work with organisations developing websites that allow service user and families to feedback on practice and quality. For example, the government's portal, which is part of the NHS Choices website, sounds like an ambitious version of how CQC quality and risk profiles were originally presented. But these consumer-informing risk profiles have not developed into the quality improvement tool some envisioned, due in part to the relatively limited data flows in social care. The government's portal though sounds like a heavyweight industry in waiting and providers are concerned that it will add administrative burden with little real benefit for service users or families.</p> <p>It is important to note that many of the initiatives outlined in the white paper are voluntary and it is unclear how key features of the new architecture will work together. Take the Nice-produced quality standards, these will be aspirational statements of high-quality care while CQC-monitored essential standards are legally binding. But how will consumers and commissioners know which is which and whether services meet a relevant quality standard?</p> <p>And finally, there's an obvious but important note of caution about how you can drive up quality without significant investment. The detailed impact assessments accompanying the white paper suggest additional spending on quality and the workforce \u2013 a critical and central influencer of quality \u2013 of only some \u00a3140m over 10 years and only \u00a315.2m over the years 2012-13 and 2013-14. Such small sums are surely unlikely to be transformative, in a sector currently spending some \u00a316bn of public funds on adult social care.</p> <p>The longer I look at the white paper, the harder it is to see it as a coherent and compelling vision for driving continuous improvement. The best strategies are usually simple ones but the degree of structural complexity and competing systems these proposals introduce will be confusing and unhelpful to the public. Combine that with the fact that the proposals in Caring for our future present us with little that is new, the transformative vision of quality in social care that Lansley presents at the start of the white paper looks increasingly out of focus.</p> <p><strong> This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-social-care-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the social care network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>"
