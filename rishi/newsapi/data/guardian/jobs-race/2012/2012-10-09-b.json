  "<p>Nosa Aimuyo represents a dilemma for the US supreme court. The young African American student cannot say precisely how he won a place at the University of Texas in Austin. His grades were good although not near enough to the top of his class to guarantee him entry. But he had a couple of extra strings to his bow as a musician and in speaking a foreign language. Then there was the colour of his skin.</p> <p>\"I can't say what got me in. I was raised in an upper middle class neighbourhood in Dallas, and went to a middle class school so I wasn't disadvantaged,\" said Aimuyo. \"But my background is unusual. I was born in Oklahoma but my parents are from Nigeria. In school, I played in the band, I was a volunteer, I was in French class. There was more to me getting in than just my academics and just my race.\"</p> <p>The supreme court may see the things differently as it takes up the divisive issue of affirmative action in education on Wednesday. The nine judges will hear arguments on behalf of a white woman, Abigail Fisher, who says she was denied a place at the University of Texas because black and Latino students got precedence. Students such as Aimuyo.</p> <p>Fisher is backed by an array of interests that see the case as part of a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/sep/06/civil-rights-voting-under-threat-discrimination\">broader challenge to civil rights-era laws and policies </a>intended to reverse the historic injustices endured by racial minorities, in particular African Americans. Those groups argue that even if affirmative action was at one time legitimate and necessary \u2013 and not all accept that \u2013 the need for racial preferences is past and they are now unfairly disadvantaging white people.</p> <p>Critics want the court to rule that it is illegal to consider race in any shape or form in university admissions, a move that could turn efforts to broaden higher education in the US on their head.</p> <p>The University of Texas says it is a mistake to portray the issue as black and white. It argues that race plays a \"modest and nuanced\" part in its admissions procedure as the university seeks to create a diverse student body that also takes account of other factors such as class, where the student grew up, school performance relative to classmates, and political and religious affiliations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397680292\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/9/1349798412075/university-of-texas-austi-006.jpg\" alt=\"university of texas austin\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Despite its diversity, the University of Texas is not without its racial problems. Photograph: Eric Gay/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Gay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Greg Vincent, the University of Texas vice-president for diversity, said it is difficult to separate race out from the circumstances and experiences that shape potential students \u2013 and that without taking those on board, white students from privileged backgrounds and private schools would have a significant advantage.</p> <p>\"You look at all of the factors that make up a person. It's not this neat formula. Race is a very important factor in today's society \u2013&#xa0;there's no getting around that. But there are many other dimensions about an individual. All of those things become a factor. If race doesn't fit into a category it's because it's not supposed to,\" he said.</p> <p>The university has the backing of Obama administration. In a brief to the court, it said that diversity in education is a national security issue with the military, FBI, CIA and department of homeland security relying on a regular supply of well educated recruits from an array of backgrounds.</p> <p>Colin Powell, the former US secretary of state and ex-chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, joined other retired senior military officers in urging the supreme court to rule in favour of the University of Texas. So have large corporations, including Microsoft and Walmart, which told the supreme court that they \"must be able to hire highly trained employees of all races, religions, cultures and economic backgrounds\".</p> <h2>'Race is still a huge determining factor in your quality of life'</h2> <p>Texas has an unusual but not unique law that allocates 75% of places at the university to the best performing students in each state-run school. That has made its own significant contribution to diversity by, ironically, relying on the reality that many Texas schools are effectively segregated by geography, class and race.</p> <p>This year, the top 9% of pupils from every state school \u2013 from inner city Latino neighbourhoods, wealthy Houston suburbs, poor white rural small towns and districts with mostly African American residents \u2013 secured automatic places at the University of Texas.</p> <p>The legal fight is over how the remaining 25% of students are admitted \u2013 or rejected, in Fisher's case.</p> <p>Her lawyers argue that the automatic entry for top performing students is its own form of affirmative action in providing a path for underprivileged Latino and black students, and no more is needed. Vincent said it has contributed to diversity but it is not enough.</p> <p>\"Things have improved in some significant ways. There's no doubt the world is better today than it was 50 years ago. That being said, race is still a huge determining factor in your quality of life,\" he said. \"You have at least a third of African Americans who are solidly in the underclass, who are mired in poverty and have very little opportunity to get out.\"</p> <p>The Center for Equal Opportunity is among more than 20 groups and individuals filing briefs with the supreme court <a href=\"http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/briefs/11-345_petitioneramcuplfetal.authcheckdam.pdf\">in support of Fisher</a>. Its president, Roger Clegg, who served in senior legal positions in the Reagan and Bush senior administrations, calls the university's policy \"racial gerrymandering\".</p> <p>\"The costs of engaging in racial discrimination in college admissions are huge and they overwhelm any conceivable benefit. The benefits are negligible if not non-existent,\" said Clegg. \"You begin with the fact that by making an exception to the principle of non-discrimination you're setting a very dangerous precedent and also it's personally unfair to tell somebody that you would have gotten in if you'd had a different skin colour. You create resentment. You stigmatise so-called beneficiaries.\"</p> <p>Almuyo is not among the beneficiaries who feels stigmatised.</p> <p>\"Affirmative action is supposed to remedy a lot of historical inequalities that have been the result of the civil rights tensions our country has gone through. There's so much less opportunity in underprivileged areas of this state,\" he said. \"And so this Fisher case is so important because it could have a drastic effect on how the university admits people if the supreme court is against it.\"</p> <h2>Students appreciative of diversity</h2> <p>The University of Texas has been at the heart of a groundbreaking supreme court decision on race before.</p> <p>In 1950, the court struck down the \"separate but equal\" doctrine when an African American man, Heman Sweatt, sued after he was barred from the university's law school in Austin because the Texas state constitution imposed segregation in education. When Sweatt took the issue to court, the university established a separate law school for black students in Houston. The supreme court ruled that the black law school might be separate but it was not equal both in the quality of its facilities and teaching staff.</p> <p>More than 60 years later, a series of supreme court rulings have barred the use of racial quotas or a points system based on ethnicity as part of university admissions. But the court did permit the consideration of race as an influence in pursuit of a diverse student body provided it is not the deciding factor.</p> <p>\"One of the reasons why diversity is so important is that having a diverse class both promotes cross-cultural, cross-racial understanding and decreases the harmful effects of stereotypes,\" said Vincent.</p> <p>That does not mean the University of Texas is without its racial problems. Last week, a few hundred students led a protest march through the campus against incidents of racism including the throwing of balloons filled with bleach at black students. Four such attacks took place last month alone.</p> <p>Students at the University of Texas generally said they appreciated the value of diversity because it brought different experiences and ideas into the classroom. But that did not necessarily translate into support for racial preferences.</p> <p>\"I think on a college application you shouldn't even be able to print what your ethnicity is,\" Kaitlin Valentine, a biology major. \"They just shouldn't even look at that. Then the top people would get in. That would be the criteria.\"</p> <p>Adison Martinez, an information science student who describes his family as Anglo even though he has a Hispanic name, is also sceptical. </p> <p>\"I don't think racial discrimination is as pressing as it used to be. I know Hispanics do fall under the umbrella of being a minority but in Texas I don't feel like there's discrimination against Hispanics,\" he said. \"My relatives are in north Texas, and they say they're white people and a minority now. Obviously there's so many minorities they're displacing white people in Texas.\"</p> <p>But Sam Hermitte, a graduate student at studying public affairs, scorns that view. </p> <p>\"Until there's equal treatment all the way up the pipeline, I don't think you can be at the end of the pipeline and say now everything's completely level when others haven't had the same opportunities for education because they grew up in poor areas. There are lots of things that are still very inequitable in the system and so I think it is still necessary in the university,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>Let's start with the vignettes. Wind back to the 1980s. A young reporter, with a big afro and minimal experience joins a local newspaper not known for its liberalism. The early days are difficult. His performance is discussed out of earshot. \"He's just so slow and lazy, isn't he?\" says an executive, all matter of fact. \"They're all like that,\" his colleague replies.</p> <p>Time moves on. Said reporter pitches up at the Daily Express on a night shift. The newsroom is vast and open-planned and \u2013 in keeping with the black fashion of the day \u2013 he has shaved his hair low at the sides, leaving the bulk of it up top. He enters. The cavernous newsroom falls silent \u2013 like a western saloon bar when the stranger comes to town. He scans the room, frames something between a smile and a scowl and barks \"evening\" to no one in particular. The normal hubbub resumes.</p> <p>Days turn into years and, along with Fleet Street's finest, he is sent to Suffolk where a black woman, troubled of mind, has killed her children. The press pack scour the area for friends or confidants. One is located and a veteran reporter shares the spoils with his colleagues. \"He's a big bloke,\" he says, garrulous, gabbling, mouth outpacing his brain. \"He's also a nigger,\" he adds by way of description. His voice tails off as his brain sees the danger \u2013 but it's too late. The words are audible. For a second, there is silence.</p> <p>The past was indeed another country. To survive as a visible minority in the workplaces of the 70s and 80s required the ability to manoeuvre strange and occasionally hostile territory. It doesn't feel like that now, but that's not to say it might not feel like that for others. Generally, the focus shifts to the next group that hasn't yet assimilated into the dominant culture of the office. I can say things are fine, for I speak the language, watch football, drink alcohol and pay scant attention to religion. Is everything different?</p> <p>Try asking a Pole with an accent or a religiously observant Pakistani.</p> <p>For Linda Bellos, chair of the Institute of Equality and Diversity Practitioners, race relations in the workplace reflect changes in society and those changes have largely been shaped by legislation. The Race Relations Act of 1976 and the Sex Discrimination Act were little observed in the early years but came to be utilised by local authorities. \"They were ridiculed at the time as 'loony left', but councils such as Lambeth and Haringey began insisting that managers actually obeyed the law concerning discrimination,\" says Bellos. The law doesn't change hearts but it can regulate behaviour. \"We have got fewer ethnic minorities being denied jobs in general. But, of course, we know there isn't the kind of representation there should be in management or in the boardroom. If you are black and middle-class, you are reasonably OK. If you are black and working-class, that's different. Class plays a big role in determining whether you fit in and, consequently, how you are treated.\"</p> <p>But change will never be uniform. Workplaces reflect society, and some are more closed than others, be they a City trading floor, or the House of Commons, or a newsroom or Radio 1 in the 80s. They maintain a culture within the perimeter. The world outside changes: they barely notice. It's in those places that progress is most patchy.</p> <p>Change has been slow, but it does emerge. Neanderthal bosses retire. Their replacements absorb the culture, but they are younger and have different experiences; minority friends, minority neighbours; less fear of \"the other\". They start from a different place. And as different people work together, their differences seem less important. \"They're all like that,\" the senior journalist said. Five years later, he helped me get to Fleet Street.</p>",
  "<p>Sharon Bowles, the Liberal Democrat MEP, has joined the race to succeed Sir Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England, saying she had applied for the \u00a3302,000-a-year role after encouragement from \"people in London\".</p> <p>Speaking from Brussels, Bowles told the Guardian she had \"reservations\" about the benefits of quantitative easing \u2013 the electronic printing of money.</p> <p>The increasingly powerful role of governor will oversee monetary policy, financial stability and banking regulation.</p> <p>\"It's a huge job that is going to have to be done in response to eurozone integration that is progressively going to threaten the single market in financial services \u2026 The governor is going to have to go out there and negotiate so we are not on the sidelines.\" A surprise candidate to succeed King, who will step down in June next year, Bowles said she had applied on Sunday evening \u2013 hours before the 8.30am deadline on Monday.</p> <p>Bowles, who chairs the European parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee, will compete for the eight-year post with Financial Services Authority boss Lord Turner, deputy Bank governor Paul Tucker, and Sir John Vickers, who led the government's independent commission on banking. Lord Burns, currently chairman of Santander in the UK, is also regarded as a possible candidate. An Indian prisoner is said to have applied after reading the advert in the Economist.</p> <p>None of Bowles's main rivals is speaking publicly about their interest in the job, which is being advertised for the first time. However, Turner is due to address a City audience on Thursday in a speech at the Mansion House which will be closely monitored for any signals of how he might approach the governor's role.</p> <p>Bowles said her experience of Europe would demonstrate a \"change at the top\" of the Bank at a time when a new wave of financial regulation is coming from Brussels as it attempts to tackle the eurozone crisis. While she is a politician, Bowles describes her current role as chairing the economic and monetary affairs committee as \"95% apolitical\".</p> <p>\"We are going to have to negotiate and get a good relationship going between the Bank of England and the European Central Bank,\" Bowles said. An MEP since 2005, Bowles, who will not stand for re-election in 2014 when the current European parliament ends, began her career as a patent lawyer \u2013 and unusually for a potential Bank of England governor does not have a background in economics. But she was driven to politics in response to Lady Thatcher's economic approach in the 1980s.</p> <p><strong> </strong>\"I'm a physicist, a real economy person working with people doing patent applications. I could see the squeeze first-hand on them \u2026 I wanted to fight harder to keep manufacturing,\" she said.The Treasury refused to name the candidates and a spokesman said: \"The structure of the appointment process remains as set out by the chancellor.\"</p> <p>There is speculation King's successor will be named on 5 December, alongside the autumn statement.</p>",
  "<p>The Republican presidential campaign has persuaded me. Not to vote for Mitt Romney, God no. They have, however, convinced me of something else I previously considered unthinkable. In some ways, the idea betrays my black nationalist inclinations, but having witnessed the GOP's flailing for the past year and a half as they've tried to mount a campaign to unseat President Obama, I've finally come around.</p> <p>We need a White History Month.</p> <p>For anyone who speaks on issues of race publicly, the idea has long been a joke \u2013 a retort thrown at you from frustrated white folks who believe they are being discriminated against because there doesn't exist a special month set aside to celebrate <em>their</em> racial identity. They cry foul at the notion of Black History Month, Black Entertainment Television, Black Enterprise and everything else with \"black\" in the title \u2013 even, sometimes, going so far as to say these things are racist in nature because their names and missions are \"discriminatory\". It's preposterous, but they counter that they need a White History Month to provide balance and equality.</p> <p>After laughing this off for years, I'm now on the same page.</p> <p>I don't mean White History in the same way we (attempt) to celebrate Black History during February, or Women's History in March. Where these are intended to correct an imbalance in the way history is celebrated from an overwhelming white male perspective, White History Month need not rehash the tales of great white heroism. We need a different approach here.</p> <p>I mean for us to have a White History Month in the way James Baldwin once suggested a White History Week. During <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYka_Tq_mTI\">a speech before the National Press Club in 1986</a>, he presented the idea and was later questioned about the seriousness of his remark. He <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYka_Tq_mTI\">responded</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"I was not joking about White History Week \u2026 I'm serious about that. White Americans really do not not know their history, and that's one of the reasons they're in trouble. And when I suggest White History Week, I'm not making a parody of Black History Week, but I'm suggesting that the truth about this country is buried in the myths that white people have about themselves. These myths have to be excavated and only can be excavated by white people.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Most of the history we learn is built on myths. Even the black history we choose to teach in response to eurocentric learning is centered around myths. But those myths are meant to help a people reclaim a history long denied to them, to instil self-esteem in the face of disempowerment. It may not be exactly ideal, but the rationale is at least noble. The myths of white American history perpetuate oppression and inequality. They instil in white America a false sense of self-imperviousness to facts or logic.</p> <p>When George Washington can't tell a lie, Abraham Lincoln singlehandedly freed the enslaved, FDR lifted the nation out of depression and Ronald Reagan tore down the Berlin Wall with his bare hands \u2026 it's no wonder <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal/2011_06/not_all_of_history_is_open_to030564.php\">Michele Bachmann believes</a> the founding fathers fought to end slavery, <a href=\"http://theminorityeye.com/newt-gingrich-says-teaching-poor-black-kids-to-be-janitors-would-stop-them-p1167-158.htm\">Newt Gingrich thinks</a> poor black children should be janitors to teach them about work ethic, Rick Perry hunts at \"<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/03/texas-governor-rick-perry_n_992712.html\">Niggerhead</a>\" and sees no problem, Republican presidential nominee <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80097.html\">Mitt Romney can tell \"jokes\"</a> about the president's birth certificate and his campaign co-chair, John Sununu, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUSDD03B7j0\">can refer to the president</a> as \"lazy\" and \"not that bright\".</p> <p>The race-baiting and sabre-rattling that has been on display for the duration of the presidential nomination process \u2013 and now is a part of the national campaign \u2013 reveal not just a disdain for people of color, but also a deep misunderstanding of what it means to be white. Whiteness has its privileges, and among them is that your view of history is through that of the default, the conqueror, the triumphant. And when you can see history through that lens, you don't have to be burdened with understanding the consequences of your triumph from the perspective of those who were stepped on during the conquest.</p> <p>As the racial and ethnic demographics shift in this country, the Republican party has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/10/no-country-for-angry-old-white-men\">become home to an angry white reactionary base </a>that feels their privilege being threatened. What a White History Month could teach them is that this is nothing new, and that even their identity as white people has evolved. White immigrants of the 18th and 19th century, particularly those of eastern European descent, experienced discrimination, <a href=\"http://www.davidroediger.org/working_toward_whiteness.html\">but gradually gained acceptance</a> as they embraced American racism and the white Anglos needed more among their ranks to ensure they retained power.</p> <p>White America needs their myths interrogated, deconstructed and ultimately replaced with a new history altogether. Like Black History Month, a White History Month would be unable to cover all the territory needed to accomplish such a feat in so short a period of time. One would need to do so around the clock, around the calendar.</p> <p>But this is the United States, and we enjoy our pageantry. Let us observe White History Month and use it to rescue white America from itself.</p>",
  "<p>Stylish trick and treating will come easy this year. Goth is smouldering on the catwalk. Dark lipstick, pallid faces, deep-purple dresses and vampiric capes are all on trend \u2013 all you need to add is the pumpkin.</p> <p>Don't be scared. The key word is stylish.

Take <a href=\"http://www.style.com/fashionshows/review/F2012RTW-GUCCI Gucci\" title=\"\">Gucci's collection</a>. Inspired by 19th-century bohemians, it featured slithery velvet skirts, flowing chiffon gowns and brocade trousers, all in a palette of inky black, deep emerald and wine. It's dark in a wafting around a country house on New Year's Eve kind of way, rather than <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1440345/\" title=\"\">Sean Penn</a> as Robert Smith in This Must Be the Place or scowling black-clad sixth-former.</p> <p>And naysayers to Gucci's dark romance can check out other variations. <a href=\"http://www.style.com/fashionshows/review/F2012RTW-PUGH\" title=\"\">Gareth Pugh's</a> monochrome, architectural collection had a futuristic slant, which he described as \"savage, raw, and untamed\". The ultimate endorsement of the dark side comes from <a href=\"http://www.style.com/fashionshows/review/F2012RTW-ERDEM\" title=\"\">Erdem</a> \u2013 usually a purveyor of deliciously light, feminine frocks loved by Samantha Cameron, this autumn he added deep purple to his colour palette and fused his signature lace with black latex on shift dresses. The result was a pretty goth look. \"My work has been about a kind of femininity even if the aesthetic is darker,\" he says. \"Fall was much more about a woman as opposed to a girl. I was attracted to a certain type of toughness.\"</p> <p>Off the catwalk, a gothic mood is blowing in \u2013 and has just as many guises. For a streety take, celtic crosses have been spotted on <a href=\"http://fashiondip.com/trends/the-inverted-cross-trend\" title=\"\">Rihanna</a> and rising star Delilah, while <a href=\"http://theblackbelles.com/\" title=\"\">the Black Belles</a>, signed to Jack White's Third Man Records, come complete with black lipstick.

While October's Vogue features makeup artist <a href=\"http://www.illamasqua.com/explore/about-us/the-art-team/\" title=\"\">Alex Box</a> on teenage adventures in \"Hammer House heroine\" style, <a href=\"http://www.harpersbazaar.co.uk/latest-news/keira-knightley-september-cover-310712\" title=\"\">Keira Knightley</a> was on the cover of Harper's Bazaar for September, hair wild, pout painted in a delicious shade of blackcurrant. This cover alone demonstrates that this is a trend backed by the big hitters. \"The September issue is the most important of the year and we want to represent the season with the cover,\" says Kay Barron, fashion features editor. \"Goth is one of the biggest trends of the season, but it's not Camden Town goth, it's romantic.\"</p> <p>If <a href=\"http://siouxsie.firebrandstore.com/\" title=\"\">Siouxsie Sioux</a> and <a href=\"http://www.evilbeetgossip.com/2012/09/25/winona-ryder-just-sh-t-all-over-your-beetlejuice-2-hopes-and-dreams/\" title=\"\">Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice</a> were icons for 80s goths, Barron points to Rooney Mara as a reference point \u2013 \"but her on the red carpet, not in Dragon Tattoo\". <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/kristen-stewart-goes-goth-for-interview-854001\" title=\"\">Kristen Stewart</a> and <a href=\"http://gossilicious.com/?tag=evan-rachel-wood\" title=\"\">Evan Rachel Wood</a> could also work. Slick but still slightly sinister compared with, say, Emma Stone, they appeal to a customer who has devoured Twilight and True Blood. \"She's grown up with goth culture so it's not as radical as it was to people a bit older,\" says Judd Crane, director of womenswear at Selfridges. \"A full leather outfit won't be scary.\" Topshop's design director Jacqui Markham agrees. For the store's Sensationalist trend this season, they have merged goth and rock for a perfectly marketable mix. \"For a whole new generation, goth is about being noticed,\" she says. \"It's a sharp, fierce body-conscious look.\"</p> <p>It's almost enough to tempt the uninitiated such as myself. In my misspent youth, I experimented with many a street style \u2013 dyeing my hair green in a punky phase, and wearing Fred Perry polo shirts to channel a latterday mod. Yet goth fashion always seemed too much of a commitment. \"It takes a bit of getting used to, wearing this look,\" admits Amy Townsend, of the <a href=\"http://ultimategothguide.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Stripy Tights and Dark Delights' </a>goth fashion blog. \"Everyone has an opinion when you walk down the street.\" Perhaps, with goth at its softest interpretation this season, now was the time to dip a toe in the dark side?</p> <p>My goth-over comes courtesy of <a href=\"http://bleachlondon.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Bleach</a>, the hair salon in east London known for its love of subcultures. Identical-twin dream team of makeup artist Danielle Kahlani and hairdresser Nicole Kahlani \u2013 both, for extra confusion, sporting dark locks and identical ombre'd fringes \u2013 get to work in transforming me from a pastel-wearing norm to a dramatic, wild-haired romantic, and we chat about goth now. \"I don't think it's as rigid as it used to be,\" says Nicole, 25. \"You might feel like being a goth one day, and something else the next.\"</p> <p>Stepping into a goth look didn't feel as if there was no going back from black. A black velvet skater dress from Oasis had a touch of the Wednesday about it (always my favourite goth), and passed the supermarket test. It is after dark when this trend comes alive, obviously. While an empire-line Paul Smith number with lace straps was beautiful but a bit too much for real life, a Topshop chiffon frock with lace back and long layered skirt was fun for a night out. It was the makeup that really convinced me, though. Berry-coloured lips felt glam even when not worn with black. Knightley's, I'm told, is Chanel D\u00e9termin\u00e9e. That's what I'll be wearing for just enough gothic romance this winter \u2013 Halloween and beyond.</p>"
