City economists had expected the rate to stay stable. This compares with 10.5% in the EU \u2013 Spain had the highest unemployment rate at 25.1% in August while Austria had the lowest at 4.2%.</p> <p>The number of employed people in Britain rose by 212,000 to 29.6 million, the highest since records began in January 1971, although more than half of the increase was a result of part-time job creation. A survey from Legal &amp; General showed 78% of workers feel secure in their jobs this month.</p> <p>Jobless benefits claimants dropped by 4,000 to 1.6 million last month, confounding expectations of a flat outturn. This came after a sharp fall of 14,200 in August, which the ONS attributed partly to hiring in London for the Olympics. The Olympic organisers said the games required about 6,000 paid staff, up to 70,000 volunteers and around 100,000 contractors.</p> <p>\"Once again, UK data has rebutted the claim that the UK is as bad as some of the eurozone's struggling economies,\" said ING economist Rob Carnell. \"Progress was evident across a broad range of the labour report. With revised GDP data suggesting the UK returned to underlying growth in the second quarter, this labour data provides hope that this recovery has been ongoing over recent months, raising some doubt about whether the monetary policy committee will unleash a new round of asset purchases next month.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/17/bank-england-mpc-quantitative-easing\" title=\"\">Minutes of the MPC's last meeting a fortnight ago</a> showed that while the committee voted unanimously to keep interest rates and the \u00a3375bn bond-buying programme unchanged, members were split over whether more economic stimulus would be needed in future.</p> <p>The ONS data also showed that youth unemployment improved, with the number of 16 to 24-year-olds out of work falling below a million in the three months to August, down 62,000 compared with March to May. That took the jobless rate among young people down to 20.5% from 21.8%.</p> <p>Wage growth finally picked up across the economy, with average earnings rising by 1.7% in the three months to August from a year earlier. Wages have failed to keep up with inflation, which was above 5% a year ago taking the gap to over 3%. The squeeze on household incomes has now eased considerably with regular pay, excluding bonuses, up 2%, inching closer to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/16/uk-inflation-lowest-since-november-2009\" title=\"\">the rate of inflation at 2.2%</a>.</p> <p>John Hawksworth, chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, noted: \"The fall in public sector employment has slowed considerably since March while private sector employment has risen significantly. This supports our view that the economy should see a gradual recovery during the second half of this year.\"</p> <p>There are still some areas of concern, in particular further increases in long-term unemployment and the growth in part-time and freelance work. But the resilience of the labour market has puzzled economists, at a time when the UK economy slipped back into recession. One explanation is that companies have been able to hang on to more people by keeping wages low.</p> <p>Scott Corfe, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: \"UK employers may be behaving in a different way during this economic crisis compared with previous crises. Instead of shedding jobs, many employers seem to be favouring pay restraint and reduced working hours as a means of controlling costs.\"</p>",
  "<p>When I tell people I study Africans in Renaissance Britain, they often reply: \"Oh, you mean slaves?\" Despite the fact that Black History Month \u2013 currently being celebrated \u2013 is now in its 25th year, and that it's more than 60 years since <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Empire_Windrush\" title=\"\">the Windrush</a> brought the first postwar Caribbean migrants, it's clear that many wrong assumptions about the black presence in Britain are still made.</p> <p>It seems the emphasis on the horrors of slavery, including the commemoration of the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act's bicentenary in 2007, can leave many, especially the young, with a very bleak image of black history. The assumption that Africans in 16th- and 17th-century England must have been slaves is not only wrong, but dangerous.</p> <p>Of course, slavery dominates the history of Africans in the Caribbean, from where the Windrush generation arrived. John Hawkins, now infamous as the first English slave trader, <a href=\"http://slavevoyages.org/tast/database/search.faces?yearFrom=1514&amp;yearTo=1866&amp;anycaptain=john+hawkins\" title=\"\">made four slaving voyages to the Spanish Caribbean between 1562 and 1569</a>. But the English had one rule at home and another abroad. They had few qualms in trading in slaves in the Atlantic world when it suited them, but maintained that all men in England were free. In the same year as Hawkins' final voyage, an English court resolved that England had \"too pure an air for slaves to breathe in\".</p> <p>And it really was true that Africans in England were free. Diogo, an African who had been taken to England by an English pirate in 1614, later reported to the Portuguese Inquisition that when he laid foot on English soil, \"he immediately became free, because in that reign nobody is a slave.\" <a href=\"http://www.mirandakaufmann.com/common-law.html\" title=\"\">It was not legally possible to be a slave in Tudor and Stuart Britain</a> and the hundreds of black people present in these isles during those centuries were not treated as slaves either. Africans such as <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/early_times/settlers.htm\" title=\"\">Jacques Francis</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/events/edward-swarthye.htm\" title=\"\">Edward Swarthye</a> were allowed to testify in court \u2013 a privilege denied to slaves in ancient Rome and the American south, as well as to English villeins.</p> <p>Some were financially independent and owned goods, such as Reasonable Blackman, a silkweaver in 1590s Southwark, and Cattelena, who owned a cow \u2013 a valuable asset in 1625. \"James the Blackamoor\" earned wages of \u00a34 a year \u2013 on top of board, clothes and lodging \u2013 as cook to the Earl of Bath in Tawstock, Devon, in the 1640s.</p> <p>Africans were far more integrated into the English community than we might expect. Black people were baptised, married and buried in English churches. They developed long-standing, intimate relationships with English people. In October 1616, George, a \"blackamoor\", married Marie Smith in Kent. Gylman Ivye, described as a \"negro\" or \"Ethiop\", had two children named Elizabeth and Richard with Anna Spencer of Dyrham, Gloucestershire in 1578 and 1581. They were the first of over 30 children of mixed parentage to be found in parish registers before the outbreak of the English civil war in 1642.</p> <p>The lives of the free black men and women living in this country 500 years ago tell a far more positive story than is usually told. Their contribution to British history was not merely as victims of white slave-traders. If we are to counter modern-day prejudice and inequality it's important that this contribution is understood and respected by all British people, both black and white. We must not allow the spectre of the transatlantic slave trade to warp our view of black British history.</p>",
  "<h2>John Hawksworth, chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers </h2> <p>There was more good news in today's labour market data with employment continuing to rise strongly in the three months to August, and unemployment, particularly for young people, remaining on a downward trend. The fall in public sector employment has slowed considerably since March while private sector employment has risen significantly. This supports our view that the economy should see a gradual recovery during the second half of this year.</p> <p>In addition, regular pay growth edged up to 2% and is now only slightly lower than consumer price inflation of 2.2%. So the squeeze on real household incomes has eased considerably in relation to a year ago when the gap was over 3% and this should support consumer spending going forward.</p> <h2>Blerina Uruci, UK economist at Barclays Capital </h2> <p>Today's data indicates an improvement in the labour market \u2013 although it does not change the stock situation significantly as the number of unemployed remains very high at over 2.5 million. In addition, compared with the same period in 2007, the number of people in full-time employment has actually fallen by 355,000, while part-time employment has increased by 724,000. We think that with the economy still weak and consumer and investor confidence subdued, the underlying conditions are not ripe for a significant improvement in the labour market in the near term.</p> <h2>David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce </h2> <p>The latest job market figures are encouraging and support our assessment that the UK economy has returned to positive growth in the third quarter of 2012. The level of employment is at a record high, and the fall in the level of inactivity is a positive development, signalling that people are returning to the workforce. The strong trend in the labour market raises questions about the accuracy of GDP figures, which are still showing three consecutive declines over the period to the second quarter of 2012.</p> <p>Despite the positive job figures, there are still some areas of concern, particularly the further increases in the number of people that have been unemployed for more than a year, and for more than two years. The overall economic situation remains difficult. There is little doubt that the economy has been stagnant for too long, and forceful measures are needed to ensure that we return to sustainable positive growth.</p> <h2>Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit </h2> <p>The UK labour market continues to improve, with the unemployment rate falling to its lowest for over a year and employment hitting a record high. The labour market is an area where the business surveys and official data have generally agreed with each other. The concern is that the signal from the surveys has now turned from showing strong growth to a situation where companies are now cutting staff due to weak sales and uncertainty about the outlook, suggesting the good news on employment may fade as we move towards the end of the year.</p> <p>Although the third-quarter GDP data is likely to show a rebound from the drop in activity caused by extra holidays in the second quarter, the business surveys have signalled a deterioration in the underlying health of the economy in the autumn, and slower growth has induced an increased reluctance for companies to hire. This has been evident in the PMI survey, which showed companies reporting a drop in employment for the first time in ten months in September. Similarly, official data on vacancies has shown no increase over August and September (a 1,000 fall in August being offset by a 1,000 rise last month).</p> <h2>Scott Corfe, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research </h2> <p>The UK labour market has defied economic gravity since the start of the year, with unemployment falling despite the UK economy contracting between Q4 2011 and Q2 2012. This has led to questions about whether the UK's economic growth statistics are inaccurate, painting an overly pessimistic picture. It has also raised questions about conventional economic theory. The labour market statistics provide some answers, suggesting that UK employers may be behaving in a different way during this economic crisis compared with previous crises. Instead of shedding jobs, many employers seem to be favouring pay restraint and reduced working hours as a means of controlling costs.</p>",
  "<p>Young black men have experienced the sharpest rise in unemployment since the coalition came to power, a TUC report showed ahead of official unemployment figures.</p> <p>The TUC said more than one in four of black 16 to 24-year-olds are currently out of work. Young black men are more likely to be unemployed than any other ethnic group, although young Asian women have been hit by the biggest rise in unemployment over the past decade, up from 6% to 13%.</p> <p>The TUC's general secretary, Brendan Barber, said: \"The UK is in the midst of a youth jobs crisis. Over a million youngsters are out of work and many more are struggling to find the finances needed to further their education. Last week the prime minister singled out employment as a great success of the government. That's cold comfort to the one in four young black men struggling for work, or the one in six jobless young black women.\"</p> <p>Overall, unemployment is expected to have been little changed last month, while earnings growth is set to have declined further, dealing another blow to squeezed households. Figures from the Office for National Statistics are forecast to show no change in the number of people claiming jobless benefits in September. The unemployment rate is seen steady at 8.1% in the three months to August.</p> <p>Wage growth is expected to have fallen to 1.2% in the three months to August, from 1.5%. Earnings have failed to keep up with inflation, which is running at 2.2%.</p> <p>\"The resilience of the labour market has been much in the spotlight recently,\" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. \"While we cannot explain this completely, at least part of the reason rests with the restraint in pay. Moreover job patterns are much more flexible \u2013 note that despite the material rise in employment over the past year, the number of full-time employees has fallen by 65,000 with part-time working and self-employment both rising significantly.\"</p> <p>Behind the headline figures, the picture is worsening for young people. A study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that up to 66 unemployed people are chasing every retail job and two thirds of those applying for jobs did not get any response. Vacancies were filled within days and in some cases hours.</p>"
