  "<p>The Republican congressman at the centre of a row over remarks he made about rape has once again insisted that he will not quit the Missouri Senate race and described the pressure on him to quit as \"an overreaction\".</p> <p>Todd Akin said he would be ignoring a state election deadline this evening that would have provided an opportunity to exit easily. </p> <p>He is under huge pressure from the Republican leadership to stand down from the closely fought Missouri race. His decision to press on will be viewed with dismay by senior members of the party.</p> <p>Speaking live on the Mike Huckabee radio show on Tuesday, he said that he was receiving a large amount of support from small, grassroots supporters, including donations, and this helped counter-balance withdrawal of support from Republican leaders. \"I just misspoke one word in one sentence on one day,\" Akin said.</p> <p>An unusual coalition of senior and grassroots Republicans has been making a concerted effort to get him to quit.</p> <p>Tea Party groups, some of which helped Akin secure victory in the primary last week, urged him to go. There were similar calls Monday by presidential challenger Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan, congressional leaders and conservative talk show hosts. </p> <p>Under state election law, Akin would face no financial penalties if he pulls out by 6pm ET on Tuesday, and the party would be free to pick an alternative. If he goes beyond that time, the next date for withdrawal would be 25 September, but that would require a court order to allow him leave the race. </p> <p>Leaving it until September could also mean he would face significant financial penalties, such as reimbursing the cost of reprinting ballot papers or other election material.</p> <p>But the Republicans' difficulties on abortion are unlikely to go away even if Akin does quit. On Tuesday, as the leadership turned up the heat on Akin, the party approved language in its platform calling for a constitutional amendment banning abortion with no explicit exemptions in cases of rape and incest.</p> <p>Meanwhile, another Republican congressman, Steve King of Iowa, inflamed the row, defending Akin and suggesting that he'd never heard of a woman getting pregnant from statutory rape or incest. </p> <p><a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/08/steve-king-statutory-rape.php\">Talking Points Memo</a> on Monday reported that King told Iowa radio station KMEG-TV reported him saying: \"Well I just haven't heard of that being a circumstance that's been brought to me in any personal way and I'd be open to discussion about that subject matter.\" </p> <p>The controversy has also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/paul-ryan-pro-life-akin\">focused attention on the anti-abortion views</a> of Mitt Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan. </p> <p>The Missouri seat held by Democrat Claire McCaskill is regarded by Republicans as the top target in the campaign to take control of the Senate. McCaskill, who has used the row to portray Akin as an extremist, is urging him to stay in the race. </p> <p>The Republican Senate campaign committee and conservative Super Pacs have withdrawn about $10m in financial support for Akin. The last remaining hope for Akin is to attract donations from individual donors. </p> <p>If Akin quits, he could be replaced either by Jim Brunner, a businessman who came second in the primary with 30% \u2013 6% behind Akin \u2013 or Sarah Steelman, a former state treasurer, who took 29%. Brunner has already been sounding out party members about replacing Akin.</p> <p>Public Policy Polling, in a survey conducted on Monday night, showed the row has not had any significant impact on voting intentions yet. Akin is leading McCaskill 44% to 43%, almost unchanged from May when he was ahead 45% to 44%.</p> <p>It may be that the poll was conducted too soon to fully register any unease with Akin.</p> <p>As well as possible repercussions for the Senate race, Democrats also see Akin as useful in highlighting differences between the Obama-Biden ticket and the Romney-Ryan ticket on abortion. </p> <p>In the light of the row, there will be pressure to change the draft to include exceptions for rape and incest.</p>",
  "<p>The eminent US fantasy magazine <a href=\"http://weirdtalesmagazine.com/\" title=\"\">Weird Tales</a>'s decision to publish an extract from a young adult novel featuring a minority white race called the Pearls that is dominated by the black race of the Coals, which has been widely described as racist, has been attacked by readers, reviewers and authors.</p> <p>Victoria Foyt's self-published novel Revealing Eden: Save the Pearls Part One is set in a dystopian future where solar radiation means the Coals (with dark skin) can survive better than the fair-skinned Pearls. Pearls cover their white skin with dark make-up, and the black love interest of the 17-year-old white heroine Eden \u2013 shown in blackface make-up on the front cover and <a href=\"http://www.savethepearls.com/\" title=\"\">in promotional videos</a> \u2013 is described as a <a href=\"http://www.sanddollarpress.com/purchase-save-the-pearls/\" title=\"\">\"powerful, beastly man\"</a>. At one point, Foyt writes: \"Eden flinched. One of them was touching her. White-hot light exploded in her head. Before she knew it, she blurted out an incendiary racial slur. 'Get your hands off of me, you damn Coal!'\"</p> <p>The novel has been the subject of widespread attacks across the internet, with <a href=\"http://mybookgoggles.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/save-pearls-victoria-foyt-still-doesnt.html\" title=\"\">readers criticising it</a> as \"incredibly racist to pretty much every reader. Especially readers of colour\", and as a <a href=\"https://requireshate.wordpress.com/2012/08/05/down-with-coals-save-the-whites-victoria-foyts-revealing-eden-pt-1/\" title=\"\">\"white supremacist fantasy\"</a>. \"The coals/pearls contrast is itself offensive: after all, coal is dirty and cheap, whereas pearls are beautiful and valuable,\" <a href=\"https://fozmeadows.wordpress.com/2012/08/03/racism-revealing-eden-and-stgrb/\" title=\"\">wrote one blogger</a>. Some readers have said they are considering boycotting the magazine.</p> <p>Foyt, who self-published Revealing Eden but has previously been published by HarperCollins, has <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SaveThePearls/posts/443266232363526\" title=\"\">defended herself on Facebook</a> and <a href=\"http://www.savethepearls.com/judging-a-book-by-its-cover-gives-birth-to-racism/\" title=\"\">in blog posts</a>, saying that she \"abhor[s] racism\", that the book has received many positive reviews, and \"if you ask if all these reviewers are white then consider that you have a racist point of view\".</p> <p>When Weird Tales, America's oldest fantasy magazine, ran an editorial by Marvin Kaye last week defending the novel as \"a thoroughly non-racist book\" and announcing its intention to run an extract, it prompted a huge backlash from readers and writers. The author Jeff Vandermeer said he would never submit to the magazine again while it was run by the current editorial staff, describing himself as <a href=\"http://www.jeffvandermeer.com/2012/08/20/weird-tales-ann-vandermeer-and-utter-stupidity/\" title=\"\">\"just quite frankly livid and utterly enraged\"</a>, as did the writer NK Jemisin, hitting out at Weird Tales' \"brave commitment to racism\" in a blog post entitled <a href=\"http://nkjemisin.com/2012/08/this-is-how-you-destroy-something-beautiful/\" title=\"\">\"This is how you destroy something beautiful\"</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://weirdtalesmagazine.com/2011/08/23/ann-vandermeer-on-no-longer-editing-weird-tales/\" title=\"\">Ann Vandermeer</a>, the former editor of the magazine who was pushed out when it was sold to new editor Kaye, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnnVanderMeer/status/237611474233749505\" title=\"\">resigned from her current position as contributing senior editor</a> (her husband Jeff said she was <a href=\"http://www.jeffvandermeer.com/2012/08/20/weird-tales-ann-vandermeer-and-utter-stupidity/\" title=\"\">\"personally devastat[ed] given that the new vision for Weird Tales seems to be so against everything that she envisioned for the future of the magazine\"</a>).</p> <p>Now the publisher of Weird Tales has weighed in, removing Kaye's original editorial from the site \u2013 <a href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://weirdtalesmagazine.com/2012/08/15/a-thoroughly-non-racist-book/\" title=\"\">it remains cached on Google</a> \u2013 and issuing a blanket apology for the piece. \"I deeply apologise to all who were offended by our association with this book. I am offended by it. I fully respect those who have been writing negative things about us today. You are correct,\" wrote John Harlacher. \"I have not read the novel, but have gone over its online presence today. I have no need to read it. I saw the blackface video and read the excerpts the author and publisher chose to make available. I must conclude that the use of the powerful symbols of white people forced to wear blackface to escape the sun, white women lusting after black 'beast men', the 'pearls' and 'coals', etc., is goddamned ridiculous and offensive. It seems like the work of someone who does not understand the power of what she is playing with.\"</p> <p>Kaye, said Harlacher, believes that \"if you read the whole book, [Foyt] explains her use of this imagery, and it ends up as a plea for tolerance\".</p> <p>\"I say, so what,\" Harlacher continued. \"And that is the position of Weird Tales \u2014 and upon reviewing the video and other materials, Marvin is in full agreement.\"</p>"
