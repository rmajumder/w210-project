  "<p>The TUC's leader-in-waiting has suggested that unemployment is being used part of a deliberate government strategy to \"keep people scared\" and depress pay.</p> <p>Frances O'Grady, who will become the trade union organisation's first female general secretary later this year, also accused No 10 of singling out women for some of the deepest public spending cuts, after women's unemployment reached a 25-year high.</p> <p>\"You'd be forgiven for thinking that this was part of a 'back to the kitchen sink' campaign,\" she said in an interview with the Guardian: \"When you look at what's happening, with women being hit hardest by job losses, service cuts, threats to take away employment rights, pay depression and rising bills and lack of childcare... you could be forgiven for thinking there is a plan here.\"</p> <p>A preliminary motion at the TUC's annual conference next week warns that increasing unemployment is a \"deliberate policy aim of this government\". O'Grady said there is \"a fair bit of evidence\" that lengthening dole queues can be a calculated political move.</p> <p>\"There was certainly a strong view in the 1980s, not just amongst trade unions, but also amongst a number of intellectuals and commentators, that unemployment was being used as a deliberate measure to keep pay down, and to keep people scared. As long as the No 1 worry for people, keeping them up at nights, is whether they're going to have a job in the morning, then they are less likely to resist unfair changes, or unfair treatment, or cuts in real pay at work.</p> <p>\"I think we do legitimately have to ask why the government isn't taking action to create decent employment for young people, when the evidence is that if you don't do that, you really are going to pay a very high price.\" More than 2.5 million people are unemployed in the UK, a rate of 8%, including a million 16- to 24-year-olds out of work.</p> <p>This week, the TUC claimed that the number of \"underemployed\" adults, who want to convertmake their part-time job into a full-time post or wish to work more hours, has risen by 1 million since 2008 to 3.3 million. O'Grady saidalso suggested the increasingly part-time nature of the labour market had made it more difficult to unionise workers. \"If you were very cynical,\" she said, \"you might think it was a deliberate strategy.\"</p> <p>The biggest \"underemployed\" group are workers in low-skilled occupations such as farm workers and security guards. This category has grown from 500,000 people seeking full-time work or more shifts to nearly 674,000 people, according to TUC calculations based on official government data. The highest rate of underemployment is among 16 to 24 year-olds, with nearly one in five working people in that age bracket qualifying as underemployed.</p> <p>The TUC represents 54 trade unions and more than six million workers in the UK.</p> <p>A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said of the TUC's claims: \"To suggest [youth unemployment] is a deliberate policy is utterly ridiculous, a ridiculous accusation that is, quite frankly, utterly laughable.</p> <p>\"The government is determined to tackle youth unemployment; the Youth Contract will provide nearly half a million new opportunities for 18 to 24-year-olds and is backed by almost \u00a31bn of funding. We support the creation of jobs be they full time or part-time.\"</p>",

We proposed that it should be displayed on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square during the Paralympics, but this was turned down. However, we have presented a bronze bust of Guttmann from the same mould to the <a href=\"http://www.paralympic.org/TheIPC\" title=\"\">International Paralympic Committee</a>, which will display it at all Paralympic Games, summer and winter. It took pride of place at the special service in St Paul's on 26 August before being sent to the Paralympic Park.

  "<p>Two things surprised me, the first time I saw Atos emblazoned all over the Paralympic Games: first, what a bizarre idea, for a company that is the single biggest identified threat to disabled people, to want to sponsor the event; second, what's in it for them? They already have incredible brand recognition. Anyone with even a passing interest will have heard wordplay (\"they couldn't give a tos\"). It is well known that the value of their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/28/atos-3bn-government-contracts-paralympics\" title=\"\">contracts from the UK government</a> currently stands at \u00a33bn. We know from <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/articles/britain-on-the-sick-clips\" title=\"\">Dispatches</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00wq21j\" title=\"\">Panorama</a> that Atos assessors are being given targets for removing people from the benefits \"support group\" \u2013 effectively, Christ-like, pronouncing them not disabled, in the hope that they will thereafter no longer be disabled.</p> <p>It doesn't appear to work \u2013 40% of people have appealed the decision, and 38% of those were successful. It's a mistake to infer that the rest were, therefore, caught bang to rights. Some of them simply give up, some die of their lack of illness, some take their own lives. The appeals process costs the government another \u00a350m, but that comes out of some other budget (it will probably be used, somewhere along the line, as an argument for legal aid being too expensive).</p> <p>There is no reason to suppose that a large number of disabled people are faking it. The <a href=\"http://statistics.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd2/index.php?page=fraud_error\" title=\"\">DWP's figures</a> give a preliminary estimate for 2011/12 of benefits overpayment through fraud and error at 2%, but wait: 0.8% is customer error, 0.5% is DWP error. Only 0.7% of claimants are fraudulent.</p> <p>On the subject of appeals, we know that you're more likely to be successful if you've got audio of the assessment. For \"security reasons\", Atos will not let claimants use their own recording equipment, and has purchased only 11 machines, to be split between 123 centres, to interview 11,000 people a week. At the last check, several machines were broken, but \"unfortunately\" assessments couldn't be postponed until they were mended.</p> <p>We know that Atos requires no mental&#xa0;health training from its assessors, has no specific test for the mentally ill, and takes no account of fluctuating conditions; so that's a discrimination case waiting to happen.</p> <p>Sorry to recap, when all of this has been established \u2013 but it underlines the puzzle. This is a company for whom scrutiny, indeed any kind of attention, can only lead to greater unpopularity. So why do they put themselves through it?</p> <p>Because it's part of the deal \u2013 they are not simply the government's henchmen. They are its flakcatchers.</p> <p>At a <a href=\"http://atosvictimsgroup.co.uk/2012/09/04/private-members-debate-from-11am-westminster-hall-4th-sep-2012-atos-healthcare-wca/\" title=\"\">public meeting in Westminster</a> Hall last night, various Labour MPs put questions about Atos to Chris Grayling; John McDonnell MP tweeted \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnmcdonnellMP/statuses/242947183119331328\" title=\"\">Protesters sum up exactly what this debate is all about. The Atos system is causing immense suffering &amp; killing people</a>.\" It's true but it's also wrong: all Atos does is enforce a government policy that causes immense suffering.</p> <p>People at the coalface of the work capability assessment already know this. Disability campaigners protest outside the DWP as much as Atos headquarters. Tony Smith, spokesman for <a href=\"http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Uncut</a>, pointed out: \"Atos are doing the government's dirty work.\"</p> <p>Analyst Rachael Stormonth, of <a href=\"http://www.nelson-hall.com/\" title=\"\">NelsonHall</a>, calls Atos \"whipping boys\" for the government, which I quote not to make anyone feel sorry for them \u2013 rather to point out that the very visibility, the signposting of this firm's deficiencies, should wise us up to the fact that it's a diversionary tactic. There is nothing easier than to dislike a faceless foreign corporation with apparently no attachment to the people whose lives it wrecks. But they wouldn't do it if they weren't being paid to; all our ire should go to the people who are paying them. The spectacle of the minister appearing in public to defend a company of his own commission, which enforces policies of his own devising, is ludicrous.</p> <p>On the one hand this is an inevitable side-effect of outsourcing. When services go wrong having been contracted out, of course questions are going to be asked about the company that undertook them. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/24/london-2012-olympics-g4s-military\" title=\"\">Olympics security debacle was a G4S failure</a>; while there was debate about the nature of the contractual process, G4S remained the culprit.</p> <p>But what's interesting is that these failures are rewarded with more contracts. About \u00a3400m of Atos's contracts with the government were won last month, by which time the deficiencies of their work capability assessment had been widely flagged. G4S is apparently set to win \u00a32bn worth of contracts for five prisons, its recent shambles notwithstanding (this has yet to be announced: I hope I'm wrong. I bet I'm not) And welfare-to-work firm A4e&#xa0;was repeatedly awarded new contracts <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/feb/09/a4e-welfare-to-work-contract\" title=\"\">despite an abysmal record</a>. It looks like mismanagement from a distance, but the more often it happens the more obvious it becomes \u2013 this isn't an accident. These firms take the fall, and their reward is that they are lavishly paid to enforce other unpopular and/or ill-considered policies, for which they will again take the fall. It's the perfect division of labour, since the government needs popularity and will throw money at masking its unpopular decisions, while the firms care nothing for popularity and will hoover up the money.</p> <p>At root, this is an attempt to privatise our anger \u2013 take it out of the public domain, where it might mean something, and direct it towards the private sector, where it means nothing. The flaw in this calculation is that anger&#xa0;is a limitless resource. You might as well try to privatise air.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/zoesqwilliams\" title=\"\"><em>@zoesqwilliams</em></a></p>",
  "<p>It was supposed to be so different. He promised to kick start a renaissance and make high streets the beating hearts of their communities. But when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/grant-shapps\">Grant Shapps</a> dropped his high street responsibilities to become the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/04/david-cameron-government-reshuffle-cabinet?newsfeed=true\">new Conservative Party co-chairman</a> this week, he left behind not so much an unfinished job as a well-wrought catastrophe.</p> <p>There was a small irony in that Shapps' day of departure coincided with news that the number of empty shops in Britain <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19465725\">had risen again</a>. In the previous weeks, tales of bitter recriminations and dysfunctional breakdown had emerged around Shapps' beloved Mary Portas Pilots. </p> <p>People were resigning <em>en masse</em> from town teams, councils being accused of being excessively controlling and the whole project being more about entertainment and reality TV rather than the hard work of bringing communities together. Shapps was fast turning the serious business of regenerating high streets into a farce. A headline this week read: <a href=\"http://www.drapersonline.com/blogs/are-the-portas-pilots-dead-before-theyve-been-born/5040295.article?blocktitle=Comment&amp;contentID=7480\">'Are the Portas Pilots now dead in the water?'</a></p> <p>In the north west there's now a 20.1 per cent vacancy rate on high streets with deep-rooted problems that Shapps never had any intention of tackling. I say this because from day one it became blatantly obvious that Shapps wasn't interested in outcomes. He was more interested in column inches and air time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395719236\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/3/1346694426628/Grant-Shapps-002.jpg\" alt=\"Grant Shapps\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Falling off his high wire: Grant Shapps. Photograph: Martin Argles for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Argles/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was guided by gimmicks, not the hard business of devising policy to make a difference on the ground. Rather than adopting a language that spoke to businesses he talked like the leader of a circus, evoking Willy Wonka and promising \"golden tickets\" for towns he selected to become Portas Pilots. It was a high wire act and for a while he pulled it off, creating a great media buzz.</p> <p>But it soon started to wear thin and serious questions remained. Like how can you really be doing everything possible to support retailers when you introduce the biggest increase in business rates in 20-years? The government received a \u00a3350million business rates windfall and spent less than \u00a320million on Portas Pilots, which is a mere quarter of what the Government spent on the AV vote. This wasn't so much austerity politics; it was holding the high street up to ridicule.</p> <p>Businesses on the high street saw through it, even if the media didn't. I've lost count of the number of businesses who've told me that excessively high business rates had made their business no longer viable. When I put this to Shapps on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/SimonDanczuk\">Twitter</a> a short while back, the day before it was announced that Britain was back in recession, he made a hopeless <a href=\"http://twitter.com/grantshapps\">attempt to defend </a>the 5.6% rise he oversaw. His argument was rubbished by all corners of the Twittersphere and he quickly deleted his tweets.</p> <p>Shapps' style of delivery was all about milking the media. Businesses were an afterthought. He wasn't interested in thorny issues like credit insurance and thought he could get away with a big hike in business rates during a recession. But he couldn't avoid reality. Retail insolvencies went up by 10 per cent over the last quarter and more and more business chiefs began to speak out. The chief executive of Kurt Geiger, Britain's third largest shoe retailer was the <a href=\"http://www.drapersonline.com/news/\">latest this week</a>.</p> <p>\"At our store in the Metro Centre in Newcastle we pay \u00a3160,000 a year in business rates,\" he said. \"It basically makes the store completely unviable. When we sit down and explain this to our American owners, they say, 'What are you getting for this \u00a3160,000?' and we actually have no idea.\"</p> <p>Whether Shapps ever bothered to listen to comments like this is uncertain.</p> <p>But beneath his high wire circus act was a very different reality on the ground that was all about survival and trying to make a living in a very unforgiving economic climate. In many parts of the country now bricks and mortar retail is no longer viable. We don't need a dizzying circus act trying to divert attention from this; we need a sober assessment of what's needed to save our high streets from irreversible decline.</p> <p>At this moment, no minister has stepped forward to assume responsibility for the high street. After the reshuffle, Mary Portas was asked on Twitter who she thought would assume the remit. \"I don't have a clue,\" she responded. \"Hoping for someone with real commitment ongoing\u2026\"</p> <p>You can safely assume that she didn't mean Shapps. What we need now is a serious operator not a publicity hungry dilettante.</p> <p><em><strong><a href=\"http://www.simondanczuk.com/\">Simon Danczuk</a></strong> is Labour MP for Rochdale and Parliamentary Private Secretary for the Shadow Business Secretary, Chuka Umunna.</em></p>",
  "<p>The future of the government's review on alternatives to the Trident nuclear missile system is in doubt after Liberal Democrat Nick Harvey was stripped of his defence minister post in the reshuffle, according to MPs and campaigning groups.</p> <p>Harvey, as the armed forces minister, was responsible for monitoring the progress of a report on possible replacements for the existing fleet of Trident submarines, part of the 2010 coalition agreement. \"When you have got a review at the request of the Lib Dems, who the hell is going to manage that from now on?\" said Tessa Munt, the Lib Dem MP for Wells.</p> <p>David Laws, the Lib Dem MP for Yeovil, has been brought back into government as a junior education and Cabinet Office minister, and officially given the task of overseeing the Trident review.</p> <p>However, there is now no Lib Dem presence in the Ministry of Defence and the view in Whitehall is that the Lib Dem leadership does not think it can fight Conservative support for a new Trident system, or at least wants to concentrate its energies elsewhere.</p> <p>Harvey said on Tuesday night: \"Nick Clegg made it clear that the decision was not a reflection on my performance in the job, which he said was widely regarded as having been excellent, but rather a strategic political decision to 'trade' this post for one in another government department.\"</p> <p>Trident is not on the agenda of the Lib Dem conference in Brighton later this month.</p> <p>The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) expressed dismay at the decision to remove Harvey from his post. The group's general secretary, Kate Hudson, said: \"This is a blow to all those inside and outside the Liberal Democrats who want Trident to be reviewed. Even though they have not opposed nuclear weapons outright, they, and Nick Harvey in particular, forced the Tories to conduct a Trident alternatives review and he pushed the review forward. Now this lone dissenting voice has been purged from the MoD.\"</p> <p>In Scotland, the SNP has called for clarification over the status of the Trident alternatives review, which was due to report by the end of the year.</p> <p>Angus Robertson, the SNP's Westminster leader and defence spokesman, said: \"We need clarification from the Lib Dem leadership \u2013 have they abandoned the promise they made in the coalition agreement and capitulated to the Tories on Trident?</p> <p>\"Trident is not wanted in Scotland, and never has been \u2013 yet the UK government are proposing to waste \u00a3100bn dumping another generation of Trident nuclear weapons on the river Clyde\".</p> <p>He added: \"The vast majority of MSPs, as well as the churches, trade unions, and civic society across the nation totally oppose Trident nuclear weapons being based in Scotland. A key advantage of independence is that it is the only constitutional option which gives Scotland the powers to have Trident removed from Scottish waters.\"</p> <p>Scrapping the Trident nuclear missile system would save \u00a383.5bn and many of the jobs at risk could be transferred to other defence projects, according to a recent report by Prof Keith Hartley, a leading defence economist.</p> <p>The government has already agreed to spend \u00a35bn on a new Trident system, most of it on a new submarine design, according to the MoD. Some of the money has gone on research at the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston into the capability of a new warhead.</p>",
