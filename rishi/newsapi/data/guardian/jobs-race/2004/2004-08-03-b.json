  "A black woman whose colleagues referred to her desk as \"Robben Island\" while she worked in the most politically sensitive unit of the Home Office's immigration and nationality directorate (IND) has won her claim of racial discrimination. <p>An employment tribunal unanimously ruled that the Home Office discriminated against Devaline McKenzie after hearing that senior officials had failed to investigate her claims of bullying and harassment over two years. </p> <p>Ms McKenzie worked in the immigration service's ministerial cases unit in Croydon, which deals with decisions in which ministers and MPs have declared an interest. Ms McKenzie, 38, from Norwood, south London, told the tribunal she felt \"humiliated and victimised\" by her managers and a staff member who was supposed to be her mentor. </p> <p>She said she faced bullying on a regular basis. She was told that she was too young to be a mother and \"must have been 12\" when she gave birth to her daughter. Her desk at the Croydon headquarters was referred to by other staff as Robben Island, the South African apartheid prison where Nelson Mandela was incarcerated.</p> <p>\"The senior managers happily referred to my desk as Robben Island, claiming they did so as a representation of freedom, when Nelson Mandela was freed from that prison. I found it highly insulting to discover that the area in which I worked was being referred to as Robben Island and it was clear that this was a derogatory reference towards myself.\"</p> <p>Ms McKenzie told the tribunal that a female colleague publicly belittled her and continually made changes to her work, culminating in an \"outburst of insults\" when she was asked to draft a response to a parliamentary question.</p> <p>Her immediate managers tried to persuade her to drop her complaints against their colleague. She said she was made to feel like the instigator rather than the victim. She was given hospital treatment for stress-related pain in her legs and asked for a transfer from the Croydon office because she could not cope with the harassment.</p> <p>But senior Home Office officials refused to consider the request and failed to investigate her allegations. She felt ostracised by her colleagues. </p> <p>\"I was extremely shocked by the attitude being taken at such a high level of management. I had raised issues which had affected my ability to work at Croydon and were affecting my psychological health. Despite this, the Home Office was unwilling to investigate the matter properly.\" </p> <p>Eventually Ms McKenzie learned that she had been replaced while she was off sick due to depression. </p> <p>The London South employment tribunal unanimously ruled that the Home Office had discriminated against Ms McKenzie on racial grounds. </p> <p>Shah Qureshi, her solicitor, said: \"The tribunal was scathing in its judgment. There seemed to be collusion at local level to prevent Devaline pursuing her grievances despite the serious nature of the allegations. There was a closed shop which led to institutional racism within IND at Croydon, yet senior management failed to address this for over two years.\"</p> <p>A decision on the amount of compensation was reserved.</p>"
