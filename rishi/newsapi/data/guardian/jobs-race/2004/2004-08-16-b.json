  "<p>The last time Everton lost their opening game of the season on Merseyside as emphatically as this, they went on to win the title. That was 1984/85. There is absolutely no chance of history repeating itself. </p> <p>A pre-season of turmoil has spilled into the campaign and this was a humiliating way to begin. It was also utterly predictable. \"This would be a hard job for Alex Ferguson or Ars\u00e8ne Wenger,\" said David Moyes, offering no excuse. \"It's probably the toughest job in the Premier League at the moment. Sure, it's hard at the promoted clubs, but they don't have the expectation we have here.\" </p> <p>That expectancy has been appreciably tempered since a year ago. It is hard to judge, on the basis of an opening game against the best team in the country, if Everton's 51st year in succession in the top flight is to be their last. They were merely victims of the ritual humiliation which will be touring the country. But there were still plenty of worrying signs here to keep Moyes fretting before the transfer window closes. </p> <p>His side offered little bite in midfield, the sight of the slight Cesc F\u00e1bregas barging Thomas Gravesen off the ball summing up the Dane's wretched performance. Only Joseph Yobo offered any barrier to Arsenal's swashbuckling attacks, but up front Everton were anonymous. Kevin Campbell and James McFadden started up front and McFadden's display was so gummy that he made Pascal Cygan appear dominant. </p> <p>The young Scot limped away at the interval and presumably out of his country's squad for Wednesday's friendly with Hungary. In his absence Arsenal created incisive moves at walking pace, the ol\u00e9s having started long before the hour. </p> <p>In contrast one home partisan desperately cried out \"Come on, you bastards\" to rally Everton's crestfallen players. The plea might have come from the as yet unidentified financial backers whom the chairman Bill Kenwright has persuaded to pump \u00a320m into the club. That money is desperately needed not only to appease the bankers but also to provide Moyes with money to recruit reinforcements. </p> <p>\"My concern is that it's a bit late in the day for us to do what we really want,\" added the manager. \"I knew who I wanted, and maybe one or two things are still possible. But I'll need to be really careful what I spend the money on. I might just stick with the squad that I have.\" </p> <p>That will send shivers of apprehension down Evertonian spines. At least Wayne Rooney is expected to sign a new contract this week, albeit a deal that includes a get-out clause which is likely to see him sold next summer. In the circumstances Everton are grateful for small mercies.</p>"
