  "<p>The distinct chill we've had in the air of late will inevitably herald the usual seasonal influx of colds and flu. Lest we forget that such wintry infections are on their way, the government recently launched a media campaign urging those at high risk of flu to get vaccinated against it. However, the same week, the government also suspended the licence of a major flu vaccine manufacturer because of problems with sterility. The shortage of stocks and delays this is anticipated to cause is likely to needle those keen to protect themselves from virulent infections this winter.</p> <p>Those without the protection of a flu vaccination may be glad to know of contingency medicaments from the natural medicine chest. The natural substance most renowned for its anti-viral and immune-stimulating properties is vitamin C. Despite the fact that vitamin C is often recommended for its ability to prevent colds and flu, the science shows it is quite ineffective for this. High doses do, however, have considerable healing potential once the virus sets up camp in the body.</p> <p>In one study published in the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics, the effect of mega-dosing with vitamin C was tested on more than 700 people. </p> <p>Throughout a winter, two-thirds of the test group were treated with painkillers and decongestants if they fell foul of cold or flu. In the other third, winter infections were treated with vitamin C at a dose of 1,000mg (1g) each hour for six hours, followed by 1,000mg three times a day until the infection resolved. Overall, those receiving vitamin C treatment had cold and flu symptoms reduced by 85 per cent compared to those receiving conventional treatment.</p> <p>Another natural flu remedy is the black elderberry (Sambucus nigra L). In the laboratory, black elderberry extract has been shown to incapacitate several strains of the influenza virus, and studies show that it activates the immune system. In research published earlier this year in the Journal of International Medical Research, the effects of black elderberry extract were tested in a group of individuals with flu. Half the group were treated with 15ml of black elderberry extract, four times a day for five days, while the other half took a placebo. Those taking the black elderberry extract became well an average four days earlier than individuals taking inactive medication. Black elderberry extract is available from most health food stores under the brand name Sambucol. For those wishing to take a belt-and-braces approach, I recommend taking vitamin C and black elderberry extract together.</p> <p><strong>Dear John</strong></p> <p><strong>I am the head teacher of an infant and nursery school. We encourage the children to have a bottle of water on their table every day, but some parents are resistant to this and say their children do not like water. I was delighted with your article recently that was critical of fruit juice, but parents say they want their children to have diluted juices. Should I stick to my guns?</strong><br> Anne Holland</p> <p>As I explained in my column, I think the potential health hazards of fruit juices have been understated, and that the prime fluid for children should be water. Diluting the fruit juice - at least half and half - with water will help reduce their sugariness, but I do believe that plain water is better. I suspect one of the main reasons children will not drink water is because they have been weaned on to fruit juice at an early age. I suggest a compromise. For instance, you might consider allowing diluted fruit juice outside the class, but insist on plain water only, in transparent bottles, within the class. You may find that some children who 'won't' drink water mysteriously take up this habit in class.</p> <p>If you have any issues you would like Dr Briffa to address in his column, please email him on <a href=\"mailto:john.briffa@observer.co.uk\">john.briffa@observer.co.uk</a>.

Excesses of the hormone insulin in the body have been linked with a variety of health issues, including weight gain, raised blood pressure and diabetes.</p> <p>Recently, some science research has suggested that insulin may promote the development of certain cancers. In a study published in this month's edition of the medical journal Gastroenterology, researchers assessed the link between the use of insulin and colon cancer in almost 25,000 diabetics. Insulin use for three to five years was associated with a rough trebling of risk of colon cancer, while insulin use for more than five years appeared to increase risk of colon cancer five-fold.</p> <p>Individuals wishing to reduce their need for insulin are likely to achieve this through the consumption of a diet generally lower in sugar and starch-based carbohydrates - a concept I covered in my column last week. Any changes to insulin dosages, however, should be made in consultation with a doctor.</p>",
  "<p>Rarely can politics have been held in lower regard in the civilised world than it is today. According to the press, the governments of the United States, Britain, Germany, France and Japan have never seen their stars lower in the ascendant. The vitriol meted out to President Bush by virtually every non-American newspaper is staggering, and if it were up to them, Bush would be history on 2 November. </p> <p>Although the likes of George Soros and Warren Buffett have, surprisingly, come to the aid of John Kerry - as has the rather grubby and pernicious Michael Moore - this may not be sufficient to oust Bush from Pennsylvania Avenue. Bill Clinton is leaving his sickbed on Monday in the hope that his silver tongue will persuade wavering voters to rally to the Demo crat flag. But, alas, it is not Clinton who is seeking election. </p> <p>In the UK, the weight of money suggests that Bush, though not exactly home and hosed, is in with a great shout to be returned as commander-in-chief for another four years. It really doesn't matter a jot what the press and the public outside the US think of him. The fact remains that middle America's support is all that counts. </p> <p>Were the votes left to the young, The 'Kids' Vote', sponsored by Nickelodeon, sees Kerry in by 57 per cent to 43 per cent. Conversely, Scholastic, which claims to have had the most accurate poll since 1960, believes that pupils polled from first grade to eighth grade support Bush, 52 per cent to 47 per cent. </p> <p>In other words, this election is going down to the wire. The electorate has a choice between what are perceived as two deeply average candidates, both flawed in different areas. </p> <p>Kerry should have nailed Bush on the economy months ago. He also failed to gather momentum after three effective TV performances. That may well count against him on the day of reckoning. On balance, the hot money tells us that voters are probably more comfortable with Bush, with security of the nation against terrorism and the strong leadership he provides the orders of the day. </p> <p>Perhaps the devil you know is better than the one you don't?

  "<p>For the first time in a long while car insurance premiums paid by the UK's long-suffering motorists are no longer rising. In fact, if you insure your car comprehensively you can probably expect to see a small reduction in your premium when you next renew - assuming that you haven't made a claim or been zapped by a speed camera during the past year. </p> <p>In the past few weeks, three different organisations have all produced figures showing that car insurance premiums have peaked and in some cases are actually falling. The AA recently published its insurance index showing that the average comprehensive insurance premium fell 3% to \u00a3753 last year. Over the same period, the average quotation for third party, fire and theft (TPF&amp;T) cover rose just \u00a32 to \u00a3904. </p> <p>Neale Phillips, director of AA Insurance, says it is particularly good news for comprehensively insured car owners who suffered sharply rising premiums from 1996 until around Christmas 2003. </p> <p>\"Non-comprehensive cover is mainly chosen by young drivers who represent the highest risk for insurers - I believe this small upward trend reflects the increasing cost of meeting third-party claims. However, insurers appear to be refining the way they calculate premiums. This is leading to the reductions in premiums we are now seeing despite rising claims costs,\" he said </p> <p>It is a similar, if slightly contradictory, story over at Insuresupermarket.com. It has totted up the insurance premiums it has provided over the past 12 months and reckons they rose, on average, just under a quarter (23%) to \u00a3469 - but it said, \"quotes have been falling since May\". The difference in prices probably reflects the two organisation's different client bases. </p> <p>One area in which price falls will be particularly welcome is to cover young drivers. Quoteline Direct has just surveyed 100,000 personal car insurance customers and found that drivers aged between 17 and 24 have saved the most. </p> <p>It estimates the average premium for a driver aged between 17 and 24 in August 2004 was \u00a3682 - \u00a349 less than in August last year. Its figures for the past three months again show a steady decline in the cost of premiums. Over the past five years, young drivers have seen the largest increase in premiums of any group of drivers. </p> <p>So, what's driving these falls given that we are constantly being told that the cost of claims is rising? </p> <p>Insuresupermarket's director Richard Mason puts the price falls down to the number of recent entrants into the market which has increased competition. </p> <p>It's certainly become a more crowded market over the past few months. In the summer the Post Office launched its own insurance scheme that was provided by low-cost provider, Budget. And it has been joined by the Bradford &amp; Bingley, Nationwide and, this week, the supermarket chain Asda. </p> <p>Nationwide has embarked on a high-profile poster campaign proclaiming that it will refund any customer who takes out a policy and then discovers a cheaper quote elsewhere, which given the level of competition, looks a brave policy. </p> <p>To test some of the new entrants against the better-known existing providers, we asked them all to provide two quotes for two young drivers. </p> <p>Although by no means indicative of the overall insurance market, our mini survey does highlight the need to shop around for quotes. </p> <p>It's worth remembering that different insurers target different groups of drivers. Some will decide they don't want to insure young men, and will quote accordingly. </p> <p>Interestingly, Insuresupermarket.com also revealed which companies it thinks are coming up with the cheapest quotes. Tesco, which was number one a year ago has dropped to number five. It says the company currently offering the best deals is Budget - although this does not cover the entire market. </p> <p>Looking as past figures, it would be easy to conclude that new entrants often offer good deals at the start. They then raise premiums in the second year in the hope they will be able to retain customers too lazy to switch. </p> <p>One problem we found was that it is very difficult to make like-for-like comparisons using car insurer's websites. It most cases it was unclear what excess would be payable - particularly as most companies impose a minimum excess for young drivers. </p> <p>Lastly, consumers should also look closely at the cost of financing insurance. Insuresupermarket has also highlighted the huge difference in the interest rates charged to customers who spread the cost of the premium over the year. </p> <p>More Than is the best in this respect despite charging a hefty 13.7% - Lloyds TSB comes out the worse charging an unbelievable 23.7%. The message appears to be: pay it off in one go, and borrow the money elsewhere, if required. </p> <p><strong>How to get those premiums down</strong></p> <p>When we asked for insurance quotes for an 18-year-old, we found companies that ask for an annual premium of more than \u00a35,000 - even on a car worth just \u00a33,000. </p> <p>We asked for two sets of quotes - one for an 18-year- old, and one for a 24-year- old. We said they live in South London and drive quite a sporty car - a Peugeot 206 with a 1600cc engine which is worth around \u00a33,000. The 24-year-old had a three-years no claims bonus, the 18-year old had just passed his test. </p> <p>In both cases most companies imposed a compulsory excess - up to \u00a3400 for the 18-year-old and \u00a3150-\u00a3300 for the 24-year-old. For our 24-year-olds, Churchill offered the lowest comprehensive quote of \u00a3550 - the highest was Endsleigh at \u00a3838. New entrant Nationwide came out as the next cheapest. Other new firm Asda was the second most expensive for comprehensive cover, but was much more competitive for third party fire and theft (TPF&amp;T). </p> <p>Admiral topped the table with an eye-watering quote of \u00a35,119 for comprehensive cover - narrowly beating Asda and Bradford to the uncoveted top spot. Churchill narrowly undercut Tesco to offer the cheapest quote - \u00a32,667. </p> <p>The more likely scenario of TPF&amp;T also threw up some crazy prices. Endsleigh was the cheapest by some margin at \u00a31,968 -some \u00a3432 cheaper than the next firm Direct Line. </p> <p>Before you start panicking, there are ways to get that premium down. The most important factor is the choice of car. </p> <p>Young drivers have to stick to cars in the lowest insurance category (group A or B) such as a Vauxhall Corsa or Ford Ka, and buy a low value car. </p> <p>The installation of an industry-improved immobiliser will help, and don't modify the car in any way by adding things like alloy wheels. </p> <p>Try an advanced driving course called Pass Plus which involves taking six extra hour-long lessons comprising a range of driving conditions. Details at <a href=\"www.passplus.org.uk\">passplus.org.uk</a> </p> <p>Most insurance companies recognise this scheme and offer discounted rates (sometimes the equivalent of one year's no claims bonus) to those who have completed it. Well worth the \u00a3120 to \u00a3150 the course typically costs. </p> <p>When applying for insurance try putting the new driver's mother on the policy as a named driver, as this can bring the premium down considerably. </p> <p>Lastly, consider buying new. This is not as mad as it sounds as some manufacturers offer free insurance with some models. It can be cheaper to take the hit in depreciation than to pay the first year's insurance.</p>",
  "<p>There comes a time in a woman's life when all her friends start having babies. For the sake of argument, let's call this time 30, and let's say that while we are very happy for said friends, we are also a mite weary of the assumption that we suddenly give two hoots about how hard it is to find decent childcare/maternity clothes/three-wheeler prams. Pregnant skin, however, I can do. </p> <p>Stretchmarks, itchy skin (due to tightening) and varicose veins (the body compensating for the extra blood flow) tend to be the most obvious skin concerns for newly pregnant women, all of which are a wee bit medical for me. But having had three pregnant friends confide that their skin has suddenly gone \"haywire\" - (one dry and flaky, two excessively oily and acned), I thought I'd call pregnancy skin care expert Zita West. </p> <p>\"Use creams that include extracts of borage, rose and calendula to soothe the itching and nourish the dryness, and drink plenty of water,\" is West's advice for those with dry, flaky skin. \"And if your skin becomes too oily, use an oil-free cleanser,\" she adds. \"It's also a good idea to use fragrance-free products to avoid nausea. Cleanse your face regularly, but don't overdo it, as this will cause your skin to become dry. Stay away from any acne medicated astringents; they might contain acne medicine that may not be recommended for pregnant women.\" </p> <p>If oily skin is giving you acne, diluted tea-tree oil or lavender (both are antiseptic) may help to reduce inflammation, but if there is no improvement after a couple of treatments, \"it's best to stop\", says West. Either sit it out (it tends to clear up later in pregnancy) or see your GP. </p> <p>So what are her top tips? \"The condition of your skin represents your state of health. Eating well helps to prevent skin problems - avoid sugary foods, junk food and caffeine, and remember, alcohol is an absolute no-no during pregnancy. Drink plenty of water to ensure your skin is properly hydrated and also to flush out toxins.\"</p>",
  "Civil servants are to stage the biggest Whitehall strike for more than a decade on November 5 in a showdown with the government over plans to axe 104,000 jobs. <p>The Public and Commercial Services union announced yesterday that members voted two to one for industrial action as part of a national campaign. </p> <p>Members of the public face cancelled driving tests, delayed passports, closed benefit offices and museums, plus disruption at airports and ports in what the union described as the first step in a concerted campaign. </p> <p>Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the PCS, accused the government of a \"slash-and-burn\" approach to public services. He said: \"The people going on strike aren't faceless bureaucrats, but people providing essential services that are consistently taken for granted. They ... face massive uncertainty about their jobs and the prospect of having to work five more years to receive their pension.\" </p> <p>Ministers condemned the action. They say the union does not have the full support of its members - just 42% of the 265,000 who received ballot papers returned them. The union said 72,780 voted for the walkout, with 40,142 against. </p> <p>The industrial action promises to be the most widespread in the civil service since protests in 1993 against Tory plans to privatise parts of the public sector. The PCS is also locked in disputes over sick leave and pensions in what looks likely to be a protracted confrontation. </p> <p>Only 6,000 of the 104,000 jobs are due to go before the general election expected next spring, and the union will seek to make it a campaign issue.</p>"
