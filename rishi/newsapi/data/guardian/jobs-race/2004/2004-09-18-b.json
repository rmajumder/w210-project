  "<p>What is it with black women and shine? Skin is supposed to shine. There, I've said it. Some call it shine; I call it radiance. Of course, there is a big difference between a healthy glow and sweating buckets, but I'm talking about faces here, not bodies, and as far as I am concerned, a face that is completely matt looks all wrong. </p> <p>Making sure you're on the right side of the shine spectrum is the difference between looking like you've got great skin and looking like you've been dead a few hours. The key is to find the right face powder. I have been inseparable from my MAC pressed powder from a tender age, and while in many ways MAC still cuts the mustard as far as shades and textures are concerned, I am pleased to report there are a few new challengers to its crown. </p> <p>Armani's sheer powder is as smooth as silk, giving the skin an appearance so perfect it's almost spooky. And the pressed powder from Nars in Mountain is fab for those with Naomi skin tones, but too light for anyone darker. T LeClerc, a range that has just gone into Fenwick, also has a couple of pressed powders worth looking at (and the silver packaging is stunning). </p> <p>Most exciting, though, is Haute Face, a new range that will be available this month at Liberty. \"Our team consists of individuals from various backgrounds - Asian, Hispanic, Caucasian and African-American,\" says founder Casandra Mills. \"It is our combined sensibility that has helped us know what works for every woman.\" Mills, herself African-American, set up the company out of frustration: \"I was sick of the fact that, after years of wearing make-up, I was still having to mix different shades to get the right colour.\" </p> <p>The pressed powders are indeed fab, but it's the Zero powder that threw me - a fine powder that is so white it practically glows. I instinctively moved backwards when the brand's make-up artist, Jocelyn Zayco, tried to apply it to my forehead. I have no idea why it works, but it does: the powder instantly lifted and brightened my complexion without being remarkably chalky ... despite its scary whiteness.</p>",
  "<p>Kevin Keegan acknowledged for the first time yesterday that his job was on the line. He used words such as \"unfair\" and \"harsh\" and accused the Sun newspaper of waging a deliberate campaign to remove him from power but, ultimately, Manchester City's manager admitted their poor form had brought him to the edge of being dismissed. </p> <p>\"I've never been sacked before and I don't know how it feels. But if you're asking me whether I feel under threat, I would have to say yes,\" he said. \"My position is under threat already and we've not even come to the game [at Crystal Palace today]. We've taken only four points from our first five games, three of which have been at home. So if I said no, it would look as though I was being dismissive and unrealistic. The buck stops with the manager and nobody at this club can be happy with our results.\" </p> <p>Keegan insisted he would not resign. \"I'll stick this out. If we beat Palace we're in the top half of the table and the circus will move out of town. But if results don't go well we'll see what happens. I'll give it my best shot and if it doesn't work out I'll go back to my family.\" </p> <p>As it stands, Keegan has lost the confidence of many supporters but, crucially, he still has the support of the chairman John Wardle and the joint-majority shareholder David Makin. Makin sits with the supporters and has indicated he will call time on Keegan only if the fans turn against him. Wardle was at the training ground yesterday and though he did not want to speak publicly on Keegan's behalf this was simply because it might be construed as \"the dreaded vote of confidence\". </p> <p>\"I've got a terrific relationship with my chairman and that will continue even when I leave this club,\" said Keegan. </p> <p>\"All the supporters I meet are telling me to keep my head up. But then again I know there are fans out there who are not happy with the way things are going. If John Wardle taps me on the shoulder and says 'thanks but no thanks' I will be distraught but I will understand.\" </p> <p>Privately, Wardle has been willing to express his support for Keegan. The club have also backed Keegan's claims that the Sun is deliberately increasing the pressure on him because of a dispute between the former England manager and its editor Rebekah Wade, who was in charge of the News of the World when he sued it in 2001. \"The Sun took a cheap shot by saying Keegan would be sacked,\" said a boardroom source. \"It might as well have been Rebekah Wade's byline on the story.\" </p> <p>\"I took the woman to court and it cost them a lot of money,\" said Keegan, who banned the Sun from his press conferences because of its coverage of Marc-Vivien Foe's death. \"People hold grudges. There are people there who want to see me fall. I know guys at the Sun and they cringe about what's happening. I'm not paranoid, but what everyone asks for is fairness.\" </p> <p>Perhaps most damagingly, several players have castigated the manager in off-the-record briefings, sometimes with vitriolic criticism. Keegan is well aware of their identities but denied that he had \"lost\" the dressing room. \"I don't think there's a manager in the league who could say, honestly, that he doesn't have a problem with a player,\" he added. </p> <p>The dressing-room dissent has been rumbling since last season when Keegan's players asked him for fewer days off and more rigorous training sessions. It was not their intention to undermine him, but it did so anyway. Likewise, Danny Mills felt the need to seek a private meeting with Keegan this week to explain that he was unhappy with their preparations. Mills has involved solicitors after this was subsequently reported as a training-ground bust-up. Robbie Fowler, meanwhile, will probably be dropped today. </p> <p>Keegan's inclination is to be optimistic but, with Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle to come in the next month, he is bracing himself for the worst. \"Am I disappointed with where we are? Yes. Am I surprised I'm under pressure? No. I've been in the game a long time and whatever happens next won't surprise me. It might hurt my family and my friends but it won't surprise me.\"</p>",
  "A 20-year-old man who racially abused the owner of an Indian takeaway as he battered him about the head was convicted of murder yesterday. <p>Daniel Palmer bragged that he had broken his victim's nose as he left the scene, but in fact Quadir Ahmed, 60, of South Harrow, north-west London, died about a month after the attack on Halloween last year without regaining consciousness. </p> <p>Palmer, of Northolt, Middlesex, pleaded guilty at Snaresbrook crown court to manslaughter, but the jury convicted him of murder after just under four hours' deliberation. </p> <p>The jury was then told that Palmer was the subject of three community rehabilitation orders when he murdered Mr Ahmed. He had a conviction for the attempted robbery of an 87-year-old woman when he was just 13, and a string of other assaults. </p> <p>Palmer remained impassive as the judge told him that he must serve at least 12 years of a life sentence before he would become eligible for parole. </p> <p>The court heard that on Halloween last year trick-or-treaters had begun throwing eggs at the Zahl Indian takeaway in South Harrow. </p> <p>Mr Ahmed and his brother Abulish went outside to calm the situation, but the group became abusive and ran off, returning with Palmer. </p> <p>Palmer began mimicking the men and calling them \"Asian bastards\" before pulling an estate agent's sign out of the ground and swinging it across his victim's head. </p> <p>Witnesses described hearing a cracking noise and said the group laughed as they left the scene. </p> <p>Mr Ahmed collapsed and smashed his head on the pavement. A postmortem examination found he had internal bruising to his skull. </p> <p>Judge David Radford told Palmer that Mr Ahmed was the \"wholly innocent victim\" of a racially aggravated incident. </p> <p>He added: \"You took the leading role in shouting at the Asian men and seeking to provoke them. </p> <p>\"No violence was proffered to you or any of those you were with, but you did not break off from the confrontation you had led.\"</p>",
  "The race for the presidency appeared wide open yesterday as contradictory opinion polls suggested that the electorate is increasingly volatile. <p>After a fortnight of trailing heavily against George Bush, the Democratic challenger John Kerry appeared to have recovered much of the lost ground in two polls. </p> <p>Another, however, showed Mr Bush pulling away from Mr Kerry with a 13 percentage point lead. </p> <p>Mr Bush got another boost last night when Florida's top court ruled that the independent candidate Ralph Nader should be allowed on to the ballot, following a dispute. Mr Nader is considered likely to lure support from Mr Kerry. </p> <p>Voter volatility was best summed up by two polls for the Pew Research Centre. The first, between September 8 and 10, gave Mr Bush a 16-point lead. The second, conducted between September 11 and 14, had Mr Bush with a statistically insignificant one-point lead among probable voters and the two candidates were deadlocked among registered voters. </p> <p>A Harris Interactive poll, conducted from September 9 to 13, gave Mr Kerry a one-point lead - the same organisation gave Mr Bush a 10-point lead in June. A Gallup poll published yesterday and conducted from September 13 to 15 showed Mr Bush widening his lead with a 13-point advantage over Mr Kerry. </p> <p>Given the low turnout, the difference between likely voters and registered voters could be a significant factor.</p>",
  "<p>Clarissa Abson, 23, is a young woman who knows what she wants and is not afraid to ask for it. So when she approaches Zane, the bestselling author of black erotica in the United States, at a book signing in midtown Manhattan, she dictates a simple, clear inscription. \"Wishing you much hellified sex,\" writes Zane on the inside cover of Abson's book. </p> <p>What qualifies as hellified sex? \"Freaky shit,\" says Abson, with a laugh that threatens to drown out the city traffic. \"Screaming and shouting and hanging off the chandeliers and shit.\" </p> <p>Her friend Janelle Robinson, 29, who bought the book for her mother, opts for something slightly more modest. \"Continue to get your groove on,\" it says. \"Her writing's not sugar-coated,\" says Robinson, explaining Zane's appeal. \"When she writes about sex, she breaks it down. She gives it to you straight, plain and simple.\" </p> <p>This is about as concise and precise a description of Zane's work as you are likely to get. Zane's is a literary world in which \"dicks throb\", \"pussies flood\" and nipples stand to attention. It is a world of pre-cum, cum, postcoital, 69s and 72s (a 69 with three fingers up the bum, if you're interested). </p> <p>To call it porn, says Zane, would be inaccurate: \"Porn is just straight sex. My books have a story. If you took the sex out of it, you'd still have the story.\" This is true. In one of Zane's best-known works, Addicted, about Zoe Reynard, a successful businesswoman who discovers she is a sex addict, the protagonist does not lose her virginity until page 83. Still, since in two instances it takes only 13 pages between Zoe meeting a man for the first time and him performing cunnilingus on her, it is fair to say that there wouldn't be an awful lot of story left without the sex. </p> <p>Having sold more than two and a half million books, Zane has entered a hugely lucrative world in which the central theme - sex - is sufficiently universal that she has been translated into Japanese, Danish and Greek. At the Barnes &amp; Noble store in Union Square, Manhattan, her books were put behind the counter, not because of their explicit content, but because they kept getting stolen. </p> <p>In April, she held the number one and two spots on the bestseller list of Essence (a magazine aimed at black women), above Nobel prize-winner Toni Morrison. Last October, seven out of 15 titles on the Waldenbooks African-American bestseller list were by Zane. \"When I asked my students what they were reading, 90% of the women and about 40% of the men admitted they were reading Zane,\" says Robin Coleman, professor of communication at the University of Pittsburgh. </p> <p>On one level, Zane is to letters what Barry White is to music. \"In Chicago, a guy came up and said I was the reason for him having a second child,\" she says. \"There are a lot of women who fall into my arms crying.\" For Zane's is also a world in which the characters, plotlines and language belong to Black America. Pity the Japanese translator who had to offer a faithful rendition of: \"No matter how hoochie I tried to be, she out-hoochied me every single time. She had on a skin-can't-get-no-tighter-unless-you-embed-the-clothes-in-your-ass-tight black sundress and some black leather pumps.\" </p> <p>Back at the book signing, Robinson and Abson are at the head of a line of 50 or so fans, of whom only one is male and two are white. The sight of so many black women at a book signing in downtown Manhattan is rare. But the glimpse of Zane is even rarer. Her renown in print belies her negligible public profile. Until recently, nobody knew what she looked like because she refused to be photographed. She still refuses to divulge her real name. \"My family know what I do, but I'm married with children,\" she says. \"I chose to do this, but they didn't.\" </p> <p>Then people started masquerading as Zane. In Atlanta and Los Angeles, impostors showed up at book signings claiming they were Zane. One was even a man. Zane had to come out, and she decided to do it in style. In late July, she started a \"love bus tour\", taking her to 10 cities over three weeks, with her husband and children coming with her for some of the way. </p> <p>Zane is one of a kind. A 37-year-old former scout leader and PTA president who lives in suburban Maryland, she describes herself as a \"homebody\". By the end of lunch, the idea that this softly-spoken and gently-mannered mother of four has made a fortune out of writing dirty books seems absurd. Then, just when the bill is coming, she explains a plotline with words that make you think she has just developed Tourette's: \"... but she kept waking up with the smell of dick on her breath\", she says, in precisely the same mild voice she used to order salad. </p> <p>Her books are part of a genre that is undergoing a vigorous resurgence: fictional works in which middle-class African-American women work hard and play even harder, asserting both financial and sexual independence as they negotiate hectic jobs and frantic love lives. </p> <p>In February came Cosmopolitan Girls, by Charlotte Burley and Lyah Beth LeFlore, currently in its second printing, in which the two main characters bond over cocktails and the woes of work and family in New York. Sexual Healing, by Jill Nelson, is about two women in San Francisco who set up a sex spa in Nevada offering male prostitutes. And there is Bling, by Erica Kennedy, about a young woman from Ohio who nets a recording contract in New York and mixes it with hip-hop's elite. </p> <p>Such themes are not new. Terry McMillan, author of Waiting To Exhale and How Stella Got Her Groove Back, has trod this path before, as have Bebe Moore Campbell and rapper and broadcaster Sister Souljah with her novel The Coldest Winter Ever. But over the past 18 months a critical mass of such books has gathered, most of which are doing well. </p> <p>\"We think there is a very healthy market for African-American chick lit, and we plan to capitalise on it,\" Janet Hill, president and executive editor of Harlem Moon, told the New York Times. (Harlem Moon, publisher of both Cosmopolitan Girls and Beautylicious: The Black Girl's Guide To The Fabulous Life, is an imprint of Doubleday.) \"Once these black women readers realise these books are out there, they will really catch on, and they're going to be big.\" Most include suggested themes for book clubs at the back. </p> <p>None is quite as raunchy as Zane's, but a few come close, and all share the same unapologetic blend of race, sex and class, packaged into pulp fiction. Quite what this rush of black female talent on to the nation's bookshelves means - beyond the success of the individual authors - is a moot point. If there is a theme running through them, it does not concern racism or sexism, but sex and conspicuous consumption. You do not need to venture past the first page of many to learn the status of the protagonists by their brands. On page one of Bling, for instance, we learn that Lamont Jackson is wearing a Brioni suit and Bulgari aftershave; in Cosmopolitan Girls, we know that Lindsay Bradley drives a BMW 325i; Sexual Healing starts with Lydia Beaucoup and Acey Allen swigging Taittinger. </p> <p>\"In this post-civil rights era, it's about the commodification of everything,\" says Coleman at Pittsburgh University. \"Any collective memory around struggle is minimised and status is determined by what we can buy.\" Similarly, if there is a feminist message in these books, it is not obvious. While female camaraderie lies at the heart of almost all of them, the focus is quite specifically on self- gratification, rather than on any broader sense of gender uplift. They show individual black women making strides in the workplace, but the principal way in which they assert their independence is in relation to men and, more specifically, to sex. This is girl power with an African-American \"flava\". At the end of Cosmopolitan Girls, the authors give \"the kind of advice only a friend will give\". </p> <p>Tip number one urges: \"Show off your fly-girl style. Pull out those tight jeans, that micromini or clingy dress and prance down to the nearest dance floor and shake what your mama gave ya!\" Number 11 suggests: \"Take a self day: get that hair done, those nails and toes done, and treat yourself to an expensive meal. Looking like a million bucks comes in handy, too, when you run into your ex.\" </p> <p>Zane says she is just \"flipping the script\". \"Women want their mate to have a specific image of them, and are afraid that if they open sexually their husbands won't respect them. Men are partly responsible. I want women to know there's nothing wrong with them.\" </p> <p>Tricia Rose, professor of American Studies at the University of California, believes that this is particularly apposite where black women are concerned. \"There is a stigma around black women's sexuality, which is often used as a marker of morality within the black community, where the church is so dominant, and beyond,\" says Rose, author of Longing To Tell, a book about black women's sexuality. \"It creates a squeamishness and discomfort around open sexual expression.\" </p> <p>\"Zane isn't making a feminist statement,\" says Coleman. \"It's not part of her agenda at all, but that doesn't mean that the work cannot be regarded as a contribution to the feminist debate.\" </p> <p>Given the relatively few black women authors published in the past, the significance of the current phenomenon may simply be that a demand, once ignored, for racy, pacy reads centred on the black female experience, is now being met. \"You just don't have it in popular culture in any role where black women are concerned,\" says Rose. \"Go to a newsstand and you pick up 20 magazines that do that for white men.\" Indeed, the fact that the themes of the book do not speak to broader issues is precisely their point - to shed the baggage of race and gender politics, and to travel light. \"We didn't want our book to be heavy,\" says Tonya Lewis Lee, co-author of Gotham Diaries and wife of film-maker Spike Lee. \"We need levity somewhere. We need to be able to laugh at ourselves.\" </p> <p>This hardly makes the books great works of literature. In most, both the characters and the language are clich\u00e9d. \"Time flies\", mothers get \"under your skin\", things sell \"like hotcakes\" and high-fiving drunk women shout \"You go girl\" at each other in crowded bars. But they work well as light reading, as sales indicate. African-Americans spent $325m on books in 2003 - an 8% increase on the year before and a 62.5% increase on 1996, according to Target Market News, a research company that specialises in black consumer statistics. </p> <p>To call it \"black chick lit\" is useful shorthand but, in reality, a misnomer, since that would suggest that the books represent a sub-genre of \"white chick lit\" - an attempt to inject melanin into Candace Bushnell's Sex And The City or Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones's Diary, whose principal and even secondary characters are all white. </p> <p>For some, though, this is true. \"I loved that show,\" said Lyah Beth LeFlore, referring to Sex And The City, \"but when you watched, it was as if the only people in New York living fabulous lives were thirtysomething white women, and that's a complete fallacy. There are a lot of amazing black women living interesting, glamorous lives, and it was time for our stories to be told.\" But, for the most part, the characters do not mirror their white counterparts so much as ignore them altogether, creating a self-sustained black world in which white people usually only ever enter at work. They live in black neighbourhoods, listen to music by black artists and frequent places where you are likely to find a lot of black people. </p> <p>Generally the genre is no more racially self-conscious than, say, Sex And The City, where, in a city less than half white, black people are more or less invisible. Sexual Healing is one exception. The male brothel is set up for black women only, and at one stage white feminists complain. \"If you came over this morning to give us the Miss-Ann-was-as-oppressed-as-Mammy version of history, we might as well end the meeting right here,\" says one black character. They end up joining forces to block a corrupt black preacher's efforts to revive his career by campaigning against the spa. </p> <p>The demand for these books appears to have emerged quite autonomously from their white counterparts, like a parallel universe mirroring the segregation that prevails throughout the US. This is notably true of Zane's success - she has never even seen Sex And The City, nor had most of her fans at the book signing. \"I never watched it - nobody looked like me on that show,\" said Eada Lewinson, who was waiting in the queue. \"Their sex and the city was different from mine.\" </p> <p>Zane's journey into erotica started with a short story called First Night, which she sent to a few friends while she was working in rural North Carolina. \"I was bored. The book I was writing was a legal thriller. It was the first time I had ever written something like erotica.\" Unbeknown to her, her friends sent it to their friends, and so it went on until she was receiving emails from people she didn't know. \"They said it was the hottest thing they'd ever read, that it was better than Playboy.\" </p> <p>She set up a website on AOL and received 8,000 hits in the first three weeks. AOL took it down because of the bad language. Zane started moving it around and writing more. In 1999, she set up eroticanoir.com - an ezine complete with sex advice and dirty jokes, as well as a few stories every month. People started asking for more and Zane told them if they sent her $10 she would send them 50 pages. \"I got three or four thousand orders,\" she says. \"Zane was the name on the chatrooms and it just stuck. If I was doing it again, I would still have used a pseudonym, but I would have picked something with a last name.\" </p> <p>Zane began publishing herself, starting with a collection of short stories called The Sex Chronicles: Shattering The Myth. She used black distributors to get her books out to street stalls and black bookstores, where they began to get noticed. \"It was a real FUBU moment,\" says Coleman, referring to the black-owned casualwear brand that stands for For Us By Us. \"It's for us and about us, with no relation to the other. That's part of her credibility. In chocolate cities, black bookstores are where a lot of people get their books. Then they spread by word of mouth and just get handed around.\" </p> <p>Zane also has the advantage of being prolific. She has written nine books in the past four years. Addicted, which is 326 pages long, took her just 19 days. She hadn't risen through the ranks of Amazon or the New York Times, but below the radar she was already a phenomenon when the all-too-white publishing world began to notice. Some approached her, offering six figures for more books with less explicit sex. She turned them down. \"They wanted me to write a more romantic type of novel, but I didn't see anything wrong with what I was doing, so I just carried on and thought I'd wait to see what would happen.\" </p> <p>Responses in the black community at large were mixed. Some bookshops refused to stock her and some church leaders denounced her. But a group of women in another church invited her to come and talk to them. </p> <p>She also had another problem. How to break her success to her parents? Her father is a theologian, her mother a schoolteacher. Throughout this time she had been carrying on her job in North Carolina as a saleswoman, selling everything from insurance to paper. She was making more in a month on the books than she was in a year in the day job. \"I was leading this double life because I didn't want to tell my parents. They knew I was writing, but they didn't know what I was writing.\" </p> <p>One day, while out with her mother, she nipped into a drug store and came out with a copy of Essence magazine. She showed her mother the bestseller list, on which Zane featured prominently. \"Zane, who's Zane?\" asked her mother. Zane confessed all and her mother bought a book and read it. \"She told me the language and the sex was a bit much, but that was all.\" Her father knows but has not, to her knowledge, read a book, and she doesn't expect him to. </p> <p>Finally Atria, a subsidiary of Simon &amp; Schuster, offered her a six-figure sum to keep on doing what she's doing. Now she has her own publishing house, Sterborbooks, promoting other black authors. Every now and then, when it looks as though her name might get out or her renown as a sex writer complicates matters, her husband reminds her that \"this is the hell you created\". </p> <p>And while her father hasn't mentioned her work, he did suggest they go on a writing weekend together. Zane had to say no: \"I'm not sure I could concentrate enough if I knew that my dad was in the next room, writing about religion.\"</p>"
