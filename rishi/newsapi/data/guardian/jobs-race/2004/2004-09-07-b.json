  "<p>For generations, the islanders of Sao Tome and Principe made a meagre livelihood by cultivating cocoa. The recent discovery of oil in its territorial waters took the tiny west African state somewhat by surprise. The islands' 170,000 inhabitants lacked even an effective banking system in which to deposit their sudden windfall. </p> <p>Oil exploration and production has left its mark across the African continent over the last three decades. Oil has all too often has provided the catalyst for corruption, economic mismanagement, civil unrest and even attempted coups as with the botched attempt in Equatorial Guinea that led to the arrest of Sir Mark Thatcher last month.</p> <p>Angola is often cited as a prime example of the curse of black gold. Figures from the International Monetary Fund earlier this year suggest that over $1bn (\u00a3563m) a year of the country's oil revenues have gone unaccounted for since 1996. </p> <p>In Nigeria, meanwhile, the former military dictator, General Sani Abacha, is estimated to have siphoned off $2-5bn in oil revenues directly into his personal account during his five-year reign in the mid-1990s. The average per capita income of the two countries stands at $710 and $300 respectively. Sao Tome and Principe has already experienced its fair share of instability. Dissident army troops briefly took control of the highly indebted country in July last year, anxious to gain control of the expected oil wealth. </p> <p>The decision by the restored president, Fradique de Menezes, to publicly disclose all transactions resulting from oil activities in Sao Tome and Principe's territorial waters has therefore been warmly welcomed by international lenders and development agencies.</p> <p>Nigeria, which has joint ownership of the oil-rich Gulf of Guinea, also put its name to the nine-point Abuja joint declaration, signed in late June. The transparency pact marks part of a wider programme of public financial management ushered in by the country's current president, Olusegun Obasanjo. </p> <p>The disclosure agreement explicitly endorses the <a href=\"http://www.eitransparency.org\">Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)</a>, a UK-led campaign to promote the disclosure of payments to governments from the oil, gas and mining industries. </p> <p>Announced by Tony Blair at the world summit on sustainable development in September 2002, the EITI aims to ensure that revenues from natural resources go towards public expenditure on basic needs such as health and education, rather than into the pockets of the corrupt few. </p> <p>The EITI requires countries to establish ongoing independent audits of extractive revenues and to publish all payments by companies in the participating country. </p> <p>Nigeria is one of four initial nations working with the World Bank and the UK's Department for International Development to implement the scheme. The resource-rich state is also participating in parallel transparency initiatives run by the G8 and the New Partnership for Africa's Development.</p> <p>From an international investment and development perspective, the emphasis given to public transparency in recent years is easily justified.</p> <p>\"Lack of transparency undermines public confidence in the legitimacy of the state,\" Mr Blair argued in a speech supporting the EITI last year. On the positive side, transparency can help attract foreign investment, reduce investor risk and increase the efficient use of public expenditure, the prime minister said. </p> <p>Unfortunately, keeping the books as opaque as possible benefits the immediate interests of too many people in the world's poor-but-rich countries. </p> <p>In the last couple of years, pressure groups such as the <a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoupay.org\">Publish What You Pay campaign</a> have turned their eye to the corporate sector to act as a catalyst for change, arguing that the publication of oil revenue receipts should be made mandatory. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly the position finds little support among extracting companies, few of whom are prepared to publicly break down the payments they make to individual countries. Confidentiality clauses, competitive disadvantage and non-participation by national companies have, by and large, combine to keep the data under wraps. </p> <p>Yet, some promising examples of more open book-keeping are slowly emerging. In May this year, the Angolan government took the unprecedented step of revealing that US oil major ChevronTexaco had paid $300m for the extension of a drilling concession. The government of Chad also agreed to an innovative revenue management plan for a 1,070 km (665 mile) pipeline led by US oil giant ExxonMobil. In a deal brokered by the World Bank, all the oil royalties and dividends from the project are paid into an offshore sequestered account. The oil funds are then reinvested in the country in the form of high priority poverty relief programmes. </p> <p>Essential to both cases, however, was the initial willingness of the national government to pursue a policy of openness. When BP famously decided to go it alone in 1999, disclosing its payment of a $111m signature bonus for Angola's block 31, the state oil company threatened to kick the British company out of the country.</p> <p>The example served as a convenient pretext for every other oil company since to sit on its hands, nodding assent to the principles of transparency but waiting for national governments to make the first move. With no obvious incentive for corrupt elites, such political will has been a long time in coming. When it does come, however, as with Sao Tome and Principe, oil companies will have little choice but to open their books. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Oliver Balch is managing editor of the bi-monthly journal, <a href=\"http://www.ccbriefing.co.uk\">Corporate Citzenship Briefing</a></p>",
  "Twenty years after the Swann report concluded that West Indian children in English schools were receiving a poor deal, a new education commission on London schools will reach the same conclusion today. Between these two reports are many more that have echoed the same sentiment. The results for black boys are even worse than for black girls. The report finds them \"consistently the lowest performing group across all key stages in most subject areas\". Indeed, the gap with other ethnic groups widens at each of the four key age groups that pupils are tested (7, 11, 14, 16). The differences can not be solely attributed to class since working- class boys in London from other ethnic groups, such as Bangladeshi boys, outperform middle-class black boys. <p>In a foreword to the report, Ken Livingstone, the mayor, explained his concern. Black people were London's largest ethnic minority, representing 11% of all residents. With 70% of their children failing to achieve five good GCSEs grades (A* to C), this large proportion was failing to reach a skills base that led to fur ther training and better jobs. It was crucial the city's schools harnessed the vocational, creative and intellectual skills of all its young people: \"London must be the world's most economically inclusive city if it is to be a world leader in a range of economic markets.\" </p> <p>Although Mr Livingstone stated \"nothing I say should be taken in any way as a criticism of the teaching profession as it exists today\", the report was much blunter. It found relations between black pupils and black teachers \"were generally very positive\" but \"this was often not the case with the majority of their teachers who were white\". Many black pupils reported racism including \"being overlooked for answering questions, verbal aggression from teachers and harsher reprimands\". The report noted that black boys were the least likely to receive support from home, but did not develop this important factor. Clearly more black teachers - currently only 3% of the total - are urgently needed, but those already recruited were right to warn that wider reforms were also necessary.</p>",
  "Black schoolboys have been betrayed by the education authorities for almost half a century and are struggling to overcome racism from many of their own teachers, according to a damning new report out today. <p>Members of an influential education commission say the failure of the schools system and individuals within it to successfully engage with students of African-Caribbean origin has severely hindered them and contributed to massive underachievement. </p> <p>Last year 70% of African-Caribbean boys in London left school with fewer than five or more GCSEs at the top grades of A*-C or equivalent, while African-Caribbean men are the least likely of any group to have a degree. </p> <p>During the research, which was commissioned by the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, and conducted over the past year, black boys complained of racism and stereotyping from teachers. They said chances of success were also limited by an archaic curriculum. </p> <p>Their parents told researchers they felt schools did not welcome their input. Black teachers spoke of discrimination. Only 7.4% of London's teachers are from ethnic minorities and 2.9% are black. </p> <p>The 285-page report, which represents the most exhaustive study to date of the educational underachievement of black boys, concludes that \"the English schooling system has produced dismal academic results for a high percentage of black pupils for the best part of 50 years\". </p> <p>Mr Livingstone, who has called for action to ensure that the number of ethnic minority teachers in the capital rises to least 33%, said: \"The composition of the teaching staff, governors and other professionals dealing with the education of our children must change dramatically to fully reflect the diversity of London's children.\" </p> <p>His officials have organised the London Schools and the Black Child conference to be addressed by schools minister Stephen Twigg on Saturday. </p> <p>In the study, conducted under the direction of the mayor's London Development Agency and an advisory board led by MP Diane Abbott, focus groups reached a wide degree of agreement: \"The consensus was that low teacher expectations played a major part in the underachievement of African-Caribbean pupils. In addition, inadequate levels of positive teacher attention, unfair behaviour management practices, disproportionately high levels of exclusions and an inappropriate curriculum took their toll.\" </p> <p>Pupils were acknowledged to suffer from negative peer pressure and many are said to be disadvantaged by inadequately funded schools with a high turnover of teachers. The insufficient level of involvement by some black parents is also singled out. </p> <p>The commission also heard evidence of direct discrimination. \"Racism manifested itself most harshly in being over looked for answering questions, verbal aggression from teachers and harsher reprimands than for students from other ethnic groups for the same misdemeanour.\" The report says that relationships between black pupils and white teachers was generally characterised by \"conflict and fear\". One participant complained: \"When it is white boys, it is a 'group' but when it is black boys it is a 'gang'. I think that's wrong.\" </p> <p>The commission found that in 2002, black boys started to lag behind from primary school year two. The gap widened every year after that. It plays down the role of social backgrounds because working class boys from other communities outperformed middle class African-Caribbean boys. </p> <p>In a series of recommendations, the commission calls for intervention on several levels. It urges ministers to give every parent three days a year paid leave so they can play a part in the schooling process. It also says black teachers should benefit from fast-tracking and \"golden handshakes\". </p> <p>The commission calls for urgent action to reduce the number of black pupils excluded. Controversially, it suggests that heads should not exclude pupils for a first serious offence unless the catalyst is an incident involving a knife or gun. It calls for clear procedures which would allow pupils to report racism by teachers. But they also call on black parents to play a more proactive role with their children and schools, \"regardless of resistance\". </p> <p>Last year the government launched a new package - Aiming High - backed with \u00a310m of extra funding to tackle the problem of African-Caribbean pupils' underachievement in both primary and secondary schools. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Department for Education and Skills said: \"We recognise that many pupils, particularly from African-Caribbean backgrounds are not achieving their full potential. That is why we are working with parents and community representatives to raise the achievement of minority ethnic pupils.\" </p> <p>Steve Sinnott, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"It is grossly unfair to blame teachers alone for a phenomenon which is more complex than the report appears to make out.\" </p> <p> Rampton Revisited, The Educational Experiences and Achievements of Black Boys in London Schools , published by the LDA Education Commission. </p>",
  "<p>Interviews began at the BBC yesterday for one of the most coveted jobs in radio: controller of Radio 4. </p> <p>Among applicants understood to have been called upon to explain their vision for the station were senior figures in the BBC's news and current affairs division. </p> <p>The position has been vacant since the former incumbent, Helen Boaden, was appointed director of news in the summer. </p> <p>Roger Mosey, the BBC's head of television news, is seen by some as the leading candidate. His CV includes a stint as editor of Today on Radio 4 and controller of the BBC's continuous news and sport station, Radio 5 Live. He is known to be held in high regard by Jenny Abramsky, the BBC's director of radio, who will make the appointment along with Mark Thompson, the director general. </p> <p>Mark Damazer, the BBC's deputy director of news, technically superior to Mr Mosey in the BBC hierarchy, is also thought to want the post. </p> <p>Mr Damazer, a former head of BBC political programmes, is noted for his sharp intellect. He was intricately involved in the David Kelly affair, assisting the former director general Greg Dyke in fighting off the attacks from the government. </p> <p>Others in the frame include Anne Morrison, the head of contemporary factual programmes, and Anna Carragher, the head of BBC Northern Ireland. </p> <p>The Radio 1 controller, Andy Parfitt, whose name was connected with the job when it was first advertised in August, has ruled himself out. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Tyler Br\u00fbl\u00e9, the founder of the style magazine Wallpaper*, will present BBC4's media show. Canadian-born Br\u00fbl\u00e9 will front the 30-minute programme, to be called The Desk, when it launches in January. </p> <p>In a separate development, Ofcom criticised the BBC for unnecessarily endangering a Libyan tour guide who featured in a BBC2 documentary without his consent. After Libyan authorities learned Muhunnud al-Mungoush had appeared in Holidays in the Axis of Evil, he was interrogated and beaten up. He also lost his job.</p>",
  "<p>Etienne de Villiers blamed the workload expected of a non-executive director for his decision to resign from the board of broadcaster ITV yesterday. </p> <p>The departure is the board's first since the company was listed in February and since Sir Peter Burt joined as non-executive chairman in March. </p> <p>Mr De Villiers said he had first thought of leaving when Carlton, where he had been non-executive director, announced its merger with Granada last year. He stayed on to ensure that the merger was \"constructed in an even-handed way and that a chairman was appointed who would look after the interests of all constituents\". </p> <p>With those objectives satisfied, he wanted to reduce his workload. This feeling was exacerbated, he said yesterday, when he arrived back from holiday to find a pile of documents ahead of Friday's board meeting 4 inches thick. </p> <p>\"You are expected to understand the issues and the intricacies as if you were an executive director, yet you don't have the access to information,\" he said. \"That's an unreasonable position.\" </p> <p>In a statement, he said that he was sorry to leave but that \"the workload is greater than the time I have available\". </p> <p>Mr De Villiers, a former head of Walt Disney Europe, was appointed by Michael Green, the former Carlton boss ousted as chairman of ITV following the merger. He joined the board in 2001, after Mr Green's contract - which eventually earned him \u00a315m as a payoff - was agreed. He was criticised, along with other members of the Carlton board, when the payoff was revealed. </p> <p>Mr De Villiers, 55, said yesterday that he wanted to spend more time with his wife of 31 years. He also runs a private equity fund. </p> <p>ITV denied that Sir Peter had been responsible in any way for the departure. Calling yesterday a \"sad day\", Sir Peter said: \"Etienne has made a significant and valuable contribution to ITV and at a personal level, I have benefited hugely from his insights and input.\" </p> <p>The departure prompted speculation that the two oldest members of the ITV board - Sir Brian Pitman and Sir George Russell - would soon leave. A spokesman for ITV denied that any further departures were imminent. </p> <p>Mr De Villiers' departure comes ahead of the company's first set of interim results - since the merger - on Thursday. Shares rose 1% to 105.5p yesterday amid speculation that the company would announce greater savings than the expected \u00a3100m. </p> <p>Following his appointment, Sir Peter said that he believed in refreshing company boards but that further change would be counterproductive. </p> <p>\"It would be bad enough having a new chairman without having a new bunch of non-executives.\"</p>"
