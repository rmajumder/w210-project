  "<p>Fulham's manager Chris Coleman yesterday called for the appointment of a Welshman to succeed Mark Hughes as coach of the national team but ruled himself out of contention for the position. </p> <p>John Toshack, Gary Speed, Ian Rush and Brian Flynn have been linked with the vacancy, as has the former Liverpool manager G\u00e9rard Houllier, but Coleman believes it would be a mistake to appoint the Frenchman. </p> <p>\"I'd like a Welshman to be given the job. We're a passionate nation and a Welshman should be put in charge because he'd understand the way we are,\" said the 34-year-old former Wales captain. \"I know who has been mentioned to take the job but I would like to see the manager of Wales being Welsh.\" </p> <p>Speed, who retired from international football after Wednesday's defeat by Poland, would be a popular choice but his club Bolton have attempted to block any such move by putting a \u00a3750,000 price tag on him. </p> <p>The midfielder's lack of experience also counts against him and Coleman has warned his friend that it will take an outstanding candidate to emulate Hughes. </p> <p>\"I don't know who will get the job. Gary Speed has been mentioned but Bolton have got something to say about that,\" he said. \"When Mark Hughes took the job over he went from player to manager and did it with ease. But Mark is an exceptional man; he made it look easy and it's not.\" </p> <p>Coleman's success at Craven Cottage since taking over in April 2003 makes him an ideal choice and he is reportedly on the FAW's wish list. </p> <p>But the Barclays Premiership's youngest manager said: \"I'm flattered to be linked with the Wales job. I'm a passionate Welshman who loved playing for his country, and managing the national side is something I'd love to do one day. But I'm not ready for it yet and I don't want to do it because I'm loving every minute of being at Fulham.\"</p>",
  "The Democratic challenger, John Kerry, emerged yesterday from the third and final televised debate with enhanced credentials, as he and George Bush moved into the last phase of the campaign. <p>Polls taken shortly after Wednesday night's debate in Arizona between Mr Kerry and President Bush gave the challenger the spoils for the third successive time. But an ABC poll last night put overall ratings level at 48% each. </p> <p>The Bush camp sought to wrest back the initiative. In a campaign stop in Nevada yesterday, the president attacked the Democrats' interventionist promises, as Dick Cheney, the vice-president, rebuked Mr Kerry for mentioning his daughter Mary Cheney, a lesbian, during a debate discussion on gay rights. </p> <p>\"You saw a man who will do and say anything to get elected, and I am not just speaking as a father here, although I am a pretty angry father,\" said Mr Cheney yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Kerry mentioned Mr Cheney's daughter during the debate when asked whether being gay was a choice. </p> <p>\"We're all God's children,\" he said. \"And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, who she was born as.\" </p> <p>Lynne Cheney, the vice-president's wife, accused Mr Kerry of playing politics with her family and denounced his response as a \"cheap and tawdry political trick\". </p> <p>\"This is not a good man,\" she told a post-debate rally. </p> <p>Nonetheless, Mr Kerry came out of the televised showdown with the upper hand. A CNN poll of 500 voters immediately afterwards showed a 52% to 39% split in favour of Mr Kerry. A CBS poll gave the challenger a 39% to 25% advantage. </p> <p>\"This was the knockout punch,\" said Terry McAuliffe, a Kerry adviser. \"The swing voters are not going to move until after the four debates. I think now you are going to see a huge movement.\" </p> <p>But the Bush camp said it had always expected a tight race. \"The president was confident, Senator Kerry was dour and defensive,\" said Ken Mehlman, the Bush campaign manager. \"It's going to be hard for anyone to have a big lead in the polls.\" </p> <p>As expected, Mr Bush painted his opponent as a tax-and-spend liberal who was out of touch with the American people. </p> <p>On the eve of the first debate Mr Bush held an 11% lead but yesterday, with just 19 days until polling day on November 2, that lead had evaporated. </p> <p>The 90-minute final debate, in which the candidates answered questions from a moderator, followed a pattern: Mr Bush talked in terms of big ideals, Mr Kerry tried to nail the incumbent on his record. </p> <p>Mr Bush attempted to engage the audience with jokes which fell flat in the formal setting and steered clear of discussing specifics and his record. </p> <p>Mr Kerry tried to erase his reputation as a wordy policy wonk by looking at the camera to deliver firm, short answers, but old habits tripped him up at times, particularly during an extended answer on the outsourcing of US jobs overseas. </p> <p>As with every debate, a moment arrived when the two men were given an opportunity to show their human sides. </p> <p>Asked by the moderator, the CBS news presenter Bob Schieffer, what they had learned from the strong women in their families, Mr Bush, referring to criticisms of his performance in the first debate, said: \"To listen to them. To stand up straight and not scowl.\" </p> <p>The comments drew the first laughter of the evening. </p> <p>Mr Kerry responded to the same question by talking about his mother. But he also showed a self-deprecating side. \"I guess the president and you and I are three examples of lucky people who married up,\" he said to Mr Schieffer. </p> <p>\"And,\" he added, in reference to his marriage to the heiress to the Heinz fortune, \"some would say maybe me more so than others.\" </p> <p>A question about federal spending and deficits yielded one of the sharpest exchanges. </p> <p>\"You know, there's a mainstream in American politics, and you sit right on the far left bank,\" Mr Bush said, accusing his opponent of voting to exceed budget ceilings 277 times. </p> <p>\"Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country,\" Mr Kerry responded, referring to the TV mafia boss. \"This president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see.\" </p> <p>Domestic issues, ranging from healthcare to the debt burden to social security reform, dominated the evening. </p> <p>The answers to a question about abortion rights gave perhaps the clearest indication that the two candidates do offer different visions for the US. </p> <p>Asked whether he would like to overturn Roe v Wade, the supreme court decision that established the legal right to abortion, Mr Bush answered: \"I will not have a litmus test. I will pick judges who will interpret the constitution, but I'll have no litmus test.\" </p> <p>Mr Kerry said\"the right of choice is a constitutional right. So I don't intend to see it undone _ Clearly the president wants to leave it in ambivalence or intends to undo it.\" </p> <p>In his most eloquent passage of the evening, Mr Bush said: \"Prayer and religion sustain me. </p> <p>\"I receive calmness in the storms of the presidency. But when I make decisions, I stand on principle, and the principles are derived from who I am.\" </p> <p>Mr Kerry replied: \"Frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbour to do in this country and on this planet.\"</p>",
  "<p>Not good. The Wayans brothers have a history of turning so-so ideas into box-office gold (I mean, those Scary Movie movies can't really be anybody's idea of a laugh-riot), but there's no excuse for this. It's as if everyone working on the film was too terrified to point out that there wasn't a single giggle in the entire thing. For the record, this is a sort of African-American take on Some Like It Hot: Shawn and Marlon Wayans play Feds who, for a painfully flimsy reason, have to impersonate a pair of skinny blonde heiresses - not a million miles away from the Hilton sisters - at a weekend in the Hamptons. This involves a lot of white latex skin covering - if nothing else, an enterprising reversal of the old blackface - but the string of allegedly humorous situations the pair find themselves in roll by to increasingly dispiriting effect. It's all a bit of a shame considering the Wayanses can be engaging performers, and Marlon has done some good stuff in Requiem for a Dream and the Coens' Ladykillers.</p>"
