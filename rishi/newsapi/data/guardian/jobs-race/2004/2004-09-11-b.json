  "<p>I have been fiddling with my eyebrows for about 15 years. But while I have just about got the hang of tweezing (super sharp tweezers, magnifying mirror and always restraining yourself a few hairs before you think you should), give me an eyebrow pencil and there is still a danger that I will come out looking like I've drawn two worms on my brow. </p> <p>Given the ridiculous amount of time and money I have spent on my brows over the years (waxing, tweezing, threading), it drives me mad that they still seem to do whatever the hell they want. I have become convinced that if I could just learn how to use an eyebrow pencil, the never-ending cycle of too thick, too thin would finally be over. </p> <p>\"Filling in with a very dark pencil gives a Halloweenish look,\" warns Wende Zomnir of Urban Therapy, whose double-ended Brow Beater, which comes in Brilliant Blonde and Brunette Bombshell, is a power tool of an eyebrow pencil. </p> <p>\"Start by filling in your brows with the 'fill' end of the pencil,\" she says. \"You'll immediately notice two things: first, the pencil is not very dark, and that is a good thing.\" (Zomnir's brows are almost black, but she uses a light chocolate shade for a more natural look.) \"The second thing,\" she continues, \"is that the pencil is quite firm. Make little feathery strokes with it, to fill in brows subtly and naturally. Then use the attached brush to brush brows up. Again with the brush, smooth your upwardly brushed brows across from the inner to outer corner, making sure to lay down any of those brushed-up hairs. That way, brows will look lifted and polished.\" </p> <p>Also great for pencil dunces is Clinique's Brow Sculpting Duo, a wonderfully easy-to-use powder and wax combination to tame the angriest brow. And finally, my favourite, Brow Zings, the shaping kit by Benefit, which has a soft pigmented wax (in redhead, blond, brunette and dark brown) and a setting wax, as well as a tiny pair of tweezers, hard angle brush and blending brush. A shoddy workman looking to blame their tools should look elsewhere.</p>",
  "More than five years after the Metropolitan police force was branded \"institutionally racist\", less than half its staff believe it treats people from different ethnic backgrounds equally. <p>A survey of officers and civilian staff published yesterday revealed that only 49% agreed that it \"treats people equally regardless of their ethnicity\". </p> <p>The survey also revealed that large numbers of Met officers believe they are under-trained, under-equipped and under-appreciated. </p> <p>Questionnaires were sent to all the Met's 43,359 officers and staff by the Work Foundation for the independent Morris inquiry, led by the former Transport and General union leader Sir Bill Morris, which is looking at professional standards and employment issues including racial bias. </p> <p>A total of 15,616 forms were returned, although the Work Foundation said many more would have been completed had they not been delivered late by the force's internal communications system. </p> <p>After extensive efforts by the Met commissioner, Sir John Stevens, 45% agreed that \"diversity has become part of the culture of the Met rather than something that needs to be consciously thought about\". </p> <p>But there was also a belief that the force was focusing too heavily on ethnic diversity rather than discrimination against women, the disabled or gay staff. Only 33% thought the balance was right, while 38% disagreed. </p> <p>The Met said it was not surprised by the results. \"However, the results need to be viewed against an organisation where record numbers of people are queuing to join, fewer people than ever are leaving, police sickness is at an all time low and, most importantly, we are delivering across the board in reducing and solving crime,\" it said.</p>",
  "<p>Barry Hills saddled his fifth winner of the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster yesterday when Etlaala overcame a nightmare run to beat the Royal Ascot winner Iceman and stake his claim for next year's Classics. </p> <p>Etlaala, a horse Hills described as being \"right out of the top drawer\", is now disputing favouritism for the 2,000 Guineas with Shamardal at 10-1 with Coral and Ladbrokes. </p> <p>Hamdan Al Maktoum's scopey chestnut had won his only previous start in good style, and Hills said: \"He missed the break and he ran green in behind horses because he's only had the one run. He was always travelling well and I hope he'll go for the Dewhurst.\" </p> <p>It was a good run from Iceman, who was conceding 5lb all round. His trainer John Gosden said: \"We are delighted with him. We will have a look at the Grand Criterium and the Dewhurst.\" </p> <p>Sean Fox's appeal against a 21-day ban has been carried over until a future date. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tony McCoy was given a 10-day ban for failing to ride out for third place on Batten Down at Bangor. The horse was subsequently found to have broken a blood vessel and the champion jockey would have obvious prospects of having the decision reversed if appealing against the ban.</p>",
  "<p>In Beyond the Fringe Jonathan Miller delivered a whimsical monologue about the day he visited the sales department of the British Rail Lost Property department. Miller had gone in search of cheap clothing and discovered to his amazement that on offer were several hundred pairs of brand new, \"cerulean blue\" gentlemen's corduroy trousers. How, Miller pondered, could so many people on a train absent-mindedly divest themselves of several hundred pairs of trousers when \"it's hard enough to lose a bagful of orange peel when you really want to\"? </p> <p>Miller's words came back to me this week when I read that thieves in Rainham had broken into a garage and made off with 3,000 umpire's jackets. According to Kent police, a member of the Association of Cricket Scorers and Umpires had been storing the coats - embroidered with the ACS&amp;U badge and the red logo of the sponsors, the Post Office - in his garage and had returned on Monday to find them gone. </p> <p>Not since it was reported that Willington FC of the Northern League had suffered the indignity of having their pitch stolen has any crime so alarmed the world of sport. That tale happily proved to be apocryphal, though that did not deter hordes of armed vigilantes eager to claim the putative reward - a free ticket in the Hall Lane half-time meat draw - from scouring County Durham in search of freshly laid lawns with penalty spots on them. </p> <p>Tragically this latest chilling dispatch from Blair's Battleground Britain proves to be incontrovertibly true. The distinctive jackets - estimated street value \u00a345,000 - have gone and so far nobody has any idea who took them or, more worrying still, why they took them. </p> <p>Questioned about the case Kent police remained stony-faced. \"Anyone who may have information in connection with this crime should come forward,\" said a spokesperson in a cunning, but so far unavailing, ruse to flush out the villains. </p> <p>Meanwhile the shockwaves from the case have reverberated down cricket's corridors of power like a late-night kebab. The ACS&amp;U has 8,000 members ranging from David Shepherd to the old blokes who pass their Saturdays and Sundays on suburban council pitches trying to ignore yelling slip cordons and get a bit of a kip. The prospect that these legal overlords of strip, square and outfield might in future have no pockets in which to store their counting stones has sent the game into crisis mode. </p> <p>Questioned about the possible effect of the loss of the association's vital supply of coats, Clare Skinner, communications officer for the MCC, said: \"It could be a bit of a problem. They are the governing body of umpires everywhere.\" Fighting hard to keep the panic from her voice Skinner added: \"Maybe they should try looking on eBay.\" </p> <p>I have just done so. Sadly I must report that instead of \"BNWT Cricket Official's Coat (poss. fetish/sexual interest). Winning bidders state size. 2,999 more available\", all I found when I typed \"umpire's jacket\" into the search engine was a hardback edition of Dickie Bird's autobiography (offered at 99p, no bids) and the Official Handbook of the Association of Cricket Umpires (1957) by RS Rait Kerr at a tempting Buy It Now price of \u00a34.50. </p> <p>In the wake of this terrible crime two obvious questions arise: why did the ACS&amp;U have so many jackets and what are the thieves planning to do with them? The first is easily dealt with. Following advice in the government's recently distributed booklet on what to do if terrorists explode a dirty nuclear device in your toolshed - for those who missed it, tuck your trousers into your socks and eat baked beans was the gist - the association had taken the precaution of stockpiling enough umpiring coats to see the summer game through a nuclear winter, with enough spare to get through a chilly start to nuclear spring as well. </p> <p>As to why anybody should want to steal the coats, one can only speculate. One hope is that as part of some situationist-style tribute to Jonathan Miller the thieves intend over the coming weeks to spread their load across Britain's train network. Already there are rumours that the rail companies are pre-recording announcements - \"We regret to report that the 3.12 service from Hatfield is running approximately 52 minutes late. This is due to umpire's jackets on the line in the Welwyn region.\" </p> <p>A more real fear is that the thieves have stolen the coats as part of some terrible plot. Is it possible that some evil mastermind has hit on the idea of using the traditional affection and respect all Britons instinctively feel for cricket officialdom to establish a totalitarian regime by sending an army of 3,000 bogus umpires on to our streets? </p> <p>Is our willingness in all circumstances to abide by the ump's decision, no matter how crazed or arbitrary, with no more protest than a shrug of the shoulders and the mouthing of the words \"blind bastard\" at the nearest TV camera, about to be used to seize control? Will a raised finger and a rueful grin send us all to the gulags? In the current climate of international menace nothing can be ruled out. By the time you read this the men in white coats may be coming for us all.</p>",
  "<p>Do you remember Henry Olonga and Andy Flower? Just asking because it seems to me that in all the fuss about substandard teams, racism, safety and security in Zimbabwe, all the talk of repercussions and the game of cricket imploding in this country if England do not fulfil their agreement to tour that beleaguered country, the real issue seems to have been carefully slipped on to the back burner. </p> <p>So to refresh any memories that need it, Olonga and Flower, Zimbabwean cricketers both, one black the other white, were the two immensely brave individuals who risked not just careers but - and this is not overdramatising - the lives not just of themselves but of friends and family by a black-armband protest, signifying the death of democracy in their native land, at Zimbabwe's opening match of the last World Cup, against Namibia in Harare. Olonga has been in self-imposed exile since; Flower plying his trade as a professional cricketer in Australia and this country. Neither is likely to return home. </p> <p>On Thursday, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board David Morgan, chose the eve of yesterday's Champions Trophy match against Zimbabwe to reiterate the ECB's intention to honour its agreement to tour. At the same time Michael Vaughan, the England captain, stressed that while there was no obligation on any of his players to tour if they had strong personal grounds for not doing so, he had received no indication from any that they had any intention of not going for the five-match series in November. </p> <p>This is strange. At the time of England's withdrawal from their World Cup match in Harare, on a spurious safety and security issue, there was believed to be a significant group who had moral objections at the time who are still in the shake-up. </p> <p>The time, though, is drawing near for a few heads to be stuck over the parapet, and just in case heads have been filled with talk of England suspension and livelihoods disappearing should players not go, all England-con tracted players, as well as ECB board members, Richard Bevan of the Professional Cricketers Association, and the media, will shortly receive a letter from a credible Zimbabwean action group (which, until it is officially in the public domain, cannot be named) which outlines a few home truths. It needs no paraphrasing: </p> <p> \"It is now inevitable that England will be touring Zimbabwe later this year, and we all understand the circumstances that have led to this inevitability. Since the tour is going ahead, however, it is important that those who may be travelling as members of the touring party be very aware of what kind of a place they will be visiting. We had hoped to be able to talk to you and to answer any questions you may have had face to face. Despite numerous requests, however, the ECB have decided not to allow us to brief you in person. Hence this letter. </p> <p>\"Eighteen months ago, the England team chose not to travel to play the World Cup fixture against Zimbabwe scheduled for the Harare Sports Club. Other teams did make the journey north; two matches were decided in Harare, and three at the Queen's Ground in Bulawayo. The document we have enclosed was compiled shortly after the Bulawayo matches. It details what happened to some of the Zimbabweans who attended those games, and who, without disrupting play in any way, exercised their constitutional right to peaceful protest. The brutal experiences related by these people, who are only a sample of those arrested at the time, are nothing short of disgusting. </p> <p>\"By the time the England players arrive in Zimbabwe on the forthcoming visit, a new law will be in force which will ban organisations such as those who compiled the document we have sent you. Reporting of such abuse will cease, and such appalling behaviour by a government against its own citizens will become invisible to all but the victims. </p> <p>\"Other organisations, which treat such victims of torture, or feed the hungry, or nurse the sick, will have to register with the government, and have their activities closely controlled. The government itself has refused international food aid, despite a catastrophic shortfall in this year's harvest, so that it may more easily manipulate food supplies for political ends. And the previous 48-hour limit on the time that the police can detain a person before bringing charges has now been extended by an additional 21 days - renewable. </p> <p>\"The physical safety of the touring party will not be put in any jeopardy. The England team will be closely protected from any danger, and will be treated to the most lavish hospitality. But if you are one of those who do travel to Zimbabwe, remember what is going on behind the sight-screen.\" </p> <p>The document to which the letter refers, a copy of which will accompany each letter, refers to arrest, torture and rape in custody and can be viewed at <a href=\"http://www.zwnews.com\">www.zwnews.com</a> in the Exclusives section at the bottom of the home page. There is little to add.</p>",
  "<p>For some people, loafing is a full time occupation. For others, the need to make money and pay the bills restricts their loafing to a part-time occupation. Think of actors like Love Actually star Bill Nighy, who confesses that between films he loafs at every opportunity. Likewise, Capital Radio DJ and occasional chat show host Johnny Vaughan, who is a champion of the art. Like the staff of the Idler magazine, they deplore the Protestant work ethic that marries virtue to hard work. </p> <p>The people who wrote in to the Idler last year to tell readers of the jobs they accepted between loafing, fared much worse. Their stories have been compiled in Crap Jobs, a 157-page book filled with stomach churning tales. </p> <p>Editor Dan Kieran says he was surprised by the number of people who said their high-flying, full-on career was, in fact, mundane and should, more accurately, be described as a crap job. </p> <p>\"All jobs seem to be crap, whatever they are,\" he says. </p> <p>\"I think the concept of a job is completely outdated. It is a 19th century construct - selling your labour by the hour. Some people had a job for life, but even that's gone now. I think we need to reassess our relationship with work because the way we live doesn't make sense,\" he says </p> <p>\"For instance, you don't need people watching ready meals go along a conveyor belt. They are working because other people are working too hard, and don't have the time to cook. It's part of the western system of over-work and over-consumption.\" </p> <p>He argues we should end our fixation with careers and accept the need for a little loafing. \"It's the lazy who make life more interesting.\" </p> <p>Crap Jobs documents 100 of the worst occupations picked by readers. Here we choose some of the worst stinkers. </p> <p><strong>Night petrol cashier: </strong>It's tedious, soul destroying work, says one contributor. \"You're locked in, there's no escape. You're made to feel like a terminally bored zoo exhibit. </p> <p>\"Even Jesus would have lost patience had he been forced to hunt down snack foods and dairy products all night. </p> <p>\"Of course there was more to the job. I had to contend with dodgy scallies trying out newly stolen credit cards, those doing runners after filling up, and those who fling bottles and bags of coal around the forecourt. There were also the nightly thrills of the two-hour stock-take and floor mopping.\" </p> <p><strong> Phone sex-line operator: </strong>One of the best paid jobs highlighted in the book, a contributor says the manual given to new staff was the highlight. \"It contained gems such as 'phrases men like to hear from you', with 'I'm separating my arse cheeks' in the top 10. Also there was an excellent 'dictionary of filth', scripts for 'Lesbian Watersports' and a 'Guide for the Dominatrix'. </p> <p>Yet the initial fascination with guiding male callers to a sexual climax wore off quickly. \"It is quite shocking how this all very quickly becomes mundane,\" she says. </p> <p><strong> Battery breaker: </strong>Not your average torch battery - they just go straight into landfill sites. These monsters are industrial strength batteries from trains. In a hangar somewhere there are blokes (and they are all men) breaking open batteries to retrieve the lead core. \"You'd drain the acid, slam the battery at an angle to break the pitch seal, and then the lead core would fly out,\" says Stephen Murray. The acid was always a problem. \"It always found a way in,\" he says. </p> <p><strong> Pea checker: </strong>This is Mr Kieran's favourite...standing by a conveyor belt picking out discoloured peas. Like many workers on conveyor belts, a glance away and \"you feel as though everything around you is moving\". </p> <p><strong> Kebab shop assistant: </strong>Much worse than pea checking. \"You take about 10Kg of defrosting lamb mince and mix it with 'secret ingredients' (spices salt, pepper and volume-increasing 'grit'). Then you grab a huge handful of the freezing mixture, form it into a doughnut shape and then push it over a three-foot pole that is welded to a metal base.\" Repeat the process until you have the fully-fledged \"tower of meat\". Then make another one...and another one. </p> <p><strong>North Sea ferry cabin cleaner: </strong>Let's face it, the North Sea is never kind. So working in the bowels of a ferry with a cargo of fat truckers can only make worse. Just a snippet from this long tale of woe is enough to turn off most jobseekers. </p> <p>There are some benefits, apparently. \"At night ... we would all pile into one of the crew cabins and get slaughtered on duty free. There were more girls than geezers and, needless to say, in the absence of DVDs, Playstations and good TV, there were lots and lots of sexual relationships: three, four, five in a bed - you name it.\" </p> <p>Vomit and worse, however, was never far away. </p> <p><strong>Maggot farmer: </strong>It goes without saying that anything to do with maggots is not for the squeamish. </p> <p>In this case, there was an Olympic-sized swimming pool squirming with millions, if not billions, of maggots feeding on rotting animal carcasses and fish. The carcasses must be turned regularly. Nice. </p> <p>Then there is the other hangar with \"breeding\" flies that must be cleaned out and the babies - or maggots - transferred to the swimming pool. Lovely. </p> <p><strong>Trainee solicitor: </strong>It's not just the grubby and monotonous jobs people hate. They also despise jobs that make up the first stages of a glittering career. You've worked hard, been to college, completed a masters and then find your reward is the role of dogsbody at a big firm. </p> <p>Whether it's the private school fag system transferred to work, or a genuine attempt to toughen up future high-flyers, the result is the same. Bill Handley found himself repairing photocopiers, rooting around a library for forgotten files, washing cars and cleaning shoes. His time in court was limited to apologising for his boss running late. He resigned. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Crap Jobs by Dan Kieran is published by Bantam Books at \u00a39.99, available from October 7.
