  "<p>Up to 12 candidates are expected to be interviewed today and tomorrow for the controllership of Radio 4, one of the most coveted jobs in media.</p> <p>The BBC's head of TV news, Roger Mosey, who is also a former Today editor and controller of Radio 5, is being widely tipped as a frontrunner but there are at least half a dozen other internal candidates, including the head of documentaries and contemporary factual programming, Anne Morrison.</p> <p>Head of current affairs Peter Horrocks and Mark Damazer, the deputy director of news who lost out on a promotion when the director of news, Richard Sambrook, was moved to the BBC World Service, are also believed to be in the running, as are the Radio 4 drama and Anna Carragher, the head of BBC Northern Ireland.</p> <p>It is believed ITV's former head of current affairs Steve Anderson was also approached about applying for the job but has not expressed an interest.</p> <p>The post has been vacant since July when the then incumbent, Helen Boaden, was named as the new director of news in the reshuffle that saw Mr Sambrook moved. She had held the post for four years.</p> <p>The \"boards\" - as top level interviews at the BBC are called - begin today and run over several days because there are \"quite a lot of people\" to see, according to a Radio 4 spokeswoman.</p> <p>The BBC director of radio, Jenny Abramsky, begins interviewing candidates today to fill one of the highest profile positions in the BBC Radio network, which also includes running comedy and drama station Radio 7.</p> <p>It is widely believed the winning applicant will have a journalistic background and come from within the BBC. It is also thought someone without experience of radio is unlikely to get the job.</p> <p>Last year an internal candidate, Lesley Douglas, succeeded in fighting off internal and external contenders to become Jim Moir's replacement as Radio 2 controller.</p> <p>One potential BBC candidate, whose name was connected with the job when it was first advertised in August - Radio 1 controller Andy Parfitt - has also ruled himself out.</p> <p>Whoever takes over from Ms Boaden - an announcement is due by mid-September - will have much to live up to. </p> <p>The station had a record10 million listeners in 2003, boosted by news coverage of the war in Iraq, although the audience slipped back to 9.5 million by June of this year.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>From today, politics gets interesting on both sides of the Atlantic. Labor Day in the United States is the moment once every four years when the presidential election campaign shifts into top gear, and with the conference season looming here the long countdown has begun towards a general election tentatively pencilled in for next May. </p> <p>On the face of it, George Bush faces a tougher race than his Gulf war comrade, Tony Blair. The polls had him level-pegging with John Kerry until the bounce Bush gained at the end the Republican convention, and despite Friday's news that the American economy generated an extra 144,000 jobs last month, you have to go back to Herbert Hoover to find a president who has a worse employment record. </p> <p>Blair, by contrast, is defending a parliamentary majority well into three figures at a time when unemployment, at least on the claimant count, is lower than it has been since 1975. By historical standards, money is cheap and inflation benign. The polls suggest Labour will win a third term comfortably at any time of the prime minister's choosing. </p> <p>Naturally, the pundits don't always get it right. As Donald Rumsfeld put it: stuff happens. Bush could yet have an easier time of it than Blair, not least because Iraq has cemented his support among the Republican faithful, while in Britain, Labour party membership has fallen to its lowest level since the 1920s. </p> <p>The forces shaping politics also differ between the two Anglo-Saxon economies. In the US, the dividing line between Democrats and Republicans is not the economy but national security and the war of values. Bush's economic record is nothing to write home about but Kerry has yet to persuade swing voters that his alternative is any better. Come to think of it, does Kerry actually have an alternative worthy of the name? </p> <p>Given Al Gore's fate in 2000, this approach seems somewhat misguided, even perverse. Gore paid the price of failing to cash in on Bill Clinton's legacy; now Kerry seems unwilling or unable to get any traction out of the fact that the US is living massively beyond its means, courtesy of a trade deficit of 5% of gross domestic product and a budget deficit of a similar order. </p> <p>But to do so, of course, would mean Kerry would have to spell out a few uncomfortable truths: that the US needs to consume less and produce more to close the trade gap, and to spend less or tax more to close the budget deficit. </p> <p>Kerry is scared of being painted as doing down Uncle Sam, so he must try to outbid Bush for sunny optimism while hoping that poor economic news in the next two months makes the economy the defining issue of the election. </p> <p>That, frankly, does not look likely. The US economy is growing less quickly than earlier in the year but it is not about to go off the edge of a cliff. There are not that many swing states which have been particularly hard hit in the past four years in comparison with the US as a whole. Ohio is one, and that helps explain why Bush and Kerry seem to be in Cleveland or Toledo every other day. </p> <p>Kerry's soundbite is that America must stop exporting jobs - an empty slogan unless he plans to leave the World Trade Organisation and embrace protectionism. There is no indication that he has the slightest intention of taking such drastic action, which is why his real pitch to the voters is: \"I'm not Bush but my purple hearts from Vietnam guarantee that I'll be no soft touch as commander-in-chief.\" My guess is that Bush will get his second term. </p> <p>Coming up with a bullish scenario for Michael Howard is more difficult. Difficult, but not impossible. Start from the position that the fallout from Iraq has been far more serious for Blair than for Bush. Labour's private polls show that trust in the government has collapsed, leaving the government here far more dependent on the economy than the Re publicans are in the US. Labour's killer argument is that it wants to invest in the public sector while the Tories want to cut spending. Yet the government's promised spending is only possible because the economy is growing - and Gordon Brown has been prepared to raise taxes a bit. There has not been a single quarter of negative growth on Blair's watch, house prices have doubled and real incomes have risen. </p> <p>While it would be stretching a point to say the government is benefiting from a \"feelgood factor\", there is no \"feelbad factor\" either. For that to happen, there would have to be some seriously duff economic news. </p> <p>All of which makes the news from the Halifax last week particularly intriguing. Britain's biggest mortgage lender reported that house prices fell by 0.6% in August, and while there is a need to be cautious about one month's data, the sharp drop in mortgage approvals in July suggests that the long-anticipated correction may now be upon us. </p> <p>Imagine now that house prices carried on falling for the next six months and that consumers took fright. In those circumstances - and even more so should a slowdown in the US and China choke off exports - the economy would start to look pretty sick. Tax receipts would dry up and the Tories would argue that Labour's ambitious plans for the public sector could only be financed through higher taxes in a third term. </p> <p>Britain has far more undecided voters than the US and given that trust in Labour is at such rock-bottom levels, the emergence of a feelbad factor could make the election a far closer run thing. Labour is banking on many of those who have deserted the party returning to the fold, however reluctantly, before the election. But there is no cast-iron guarantee they will. </p> <p>This is very much a worst-case scenario. A counterweight to falling house prices are the surveys today from the CBI and the EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, showing that both the service sector and manufacturing are in rude good health. </p> <p>Brown remains convinced the economy is strong and getting stronger, even though he is concerned that the electorate is now deeply cynical about all aspects of the government's record. Should the economy take a turn for the worse over the autumn and winter, he also knows the Bank of England will act to steady the ship. Market sentiment has changed markedly over the past month, with predictions that interest rates will peak at 5.5% scaled back. Most analysts now believe rates are at or close to their peak; another month of weak economic data will have them talking about the likelihood of the next move in rates being down. </p> <p>Even so, cheaper borrowing might not come in time for a spring 2005 election. Monetary policy works with a lag, and the full effects of the five rises in rates since November have yet to be felt. The Bank will take some convincing that the current softness in the housing market warrants lower rates, so it will be early next year before policy might be loosened, with the full impact not feeding through for six months after that. </p> <p>No problem, you might think. The government doesn't have to call an election next spring; it could wait until October 2005 or even early 2006. In the past, though, this has been a risky strategy. The record of governments that go far into a fifth year is not good. Clement Attlee just about held on to power in 1950 but saw a majority of 144 cut to single figures. The Tories managed it in 1992. Whether they would have done so without the defenestration of Margaret Thatcher is a moot point.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>"
