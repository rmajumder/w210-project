  "<p>Walk into any campus in the country, and you will see compelling evidence that British universities are becoming more diverse. There are more international students and more from ethnic minorities; more mature students and more with disabilities. Admissions of female students have soared, and state school students mix freely with those from independent schools.</p> <p>On the surface, it might seem that the utopian vision of equal access to higher education for all is fast becoming a reality. However, if the rash of discrimination lawsuits in recent years is anything to go by, the potential for discrimination and harassment within the education system has never been greater. Now a number of British universities are hoping to nip discrimination in the bud by offering diversity training to students.</p> <p>Diversity training is already widespread for university staff, but this is the first time it has been extended to the student body. With fewer than one in 10 white Britons socialising outside their own ethnic group, the aim is to raise awareness of the advantages of social diversity and discourage behaviour that can lead to accusations of discrimination and harassment.</p> <p>The benefits for students can be enormous, according to Mike Hill, chief executive of the government graduate recruitment service, Prospects. \"Students with diversity training will be better all-round employees,\" he says. \"We live in an increasingly diverse society and it is obviously an advantage if students can engage with people from all sorts of backgrounds when they go out to work.\"</p> <p>Employment legislation is the driving force behind diversity training in the workplace. New laws are being introduced from Europe that will make it illegal for an employer to discriminate on the grounds of race, gender, disability, sexual orientation, religion or age by 2006. Similar forces are driving the campaign to educate students about diversity. Under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, higher education institutions have a legal responsibility to eliminate discrimination and promote equality of opportunity and good race relations on campus.</p> <p>One of the universities in the frontline of diversity training for students is Harper Adams University College in Shropshire. The university is planning to pilot online diversity training for its business management students early in 2005. Following assessment and evaluation, diversity training will then be rolled out to the entire student body as part of the university's professional skills programme.</p> <p>Nick Gallagher-Hughes, staff development officer at Harper Adams, says: \"One of the requirements of the Race Relations Act is that we make our student body aware of diversity issues,\" he says. \"However, we are also looking at this from a commercial point of view. We wanted to get the message across to the student body that students with diversity awareness make better employees. An online training system seemed to be the best way to do this.\" Online diversity training will be discussed at a workshop at the Leadership Foundation's staff development conference in Glasgow this week.</p> <p>Along with a few dozen universities and colleges, Harper Adams is investigating the potential of e-learning as a tool to educate students about diversity. Harper Adams is about to join 15 other institutions to buy a web-based training module from e-learning consultancy Marshall ACM, which supplies diversity training to staff at a number of universities, county councils and primary healthcare trusts.</p> <p>\"Students are often given a lot of responsibility at a very early age,\" says David Marshall, director of Marshall ACM. \"For example, you might find a 21-year-old student warder in charge of a hall of 18-year-olds. Students in these situations do not always realise they have legal responsibilities when it comes to bullying and harassment. Even a minor situation could escalate into a scenario that has legal consequences for the university.\"</p> <p>For Brunel University in Middlesex, the main attraction of web-based diversity training was the ability to train large numbers of students quickly and cheaply using the university's existing e-learning infrastructure.</p> <p>\"We wanted to make sure that we fulfilled our obligations under the Race Relations Act to eliminate discrimination and promote good relations,\" explains Kate Smith from the university's learning and teaching development unit. \"However, it would have been very difficult to provide face-to-face training for all our 13,000 students. We already use virtual learning at all of the seven schools in the university, so we chose to deliver diversity training using the same virtual learning environment.\"</p> <p>Brunel is one of the first universities actively to roll out diversity training to students. As a second stage, the university is hoping to incorporate diversity training into the mainstream syllabus. \"We are looking at ways to reflect diversity throughout the curriculum,\" says Smith. \"We want to provide opportunities for students to develop intercultural awareness, rather than simply teaching students about other cultures.\"</p> <p>But isn't there a risk that increasing awareness of discrimination and harassment on campus will lead to an increase in lawsuits against universities? Marshall doesn't think so. \"Some people are concerned that this kind of training may contribute to a more litigious society,\" he says. \"But all we are doing is informing people of their rights. It is the organisations that don't offer training who are having problems at employment tribunals.\"</p> <p>Universities in the US have been training students in diversity since the 1980s. According to a recent study by the Association of American Colleges and Universities, more than 63% of American higher education institutions offer diversity workshops or courses of academic study that focus on diversity issues. The result is a growing awareness of the benefits of diversity on campus, claims Caryn McTighe Musil, senior vice-president of the AAC&amp;U. \"Diversity is now seen as being integral to excellence, rather than being in opposition to it,\" she says.</p> <p>Discrimination is an increasingly complex issue in the education sector. Many universities are facing accusations of discrimination in favour of students from state schools, after decades of preferential treatment in the opposite direction. With growing numbers of international students at British universities, racial discrimination is no longer simply a case of black v white. The Race Relations (Amendment) Act requires universities to promote good relations between all ethnic groups on campus.</p> <p>In partnership with the National Union of Students, the Union of Students in Ireland has developed into a major provider of diversity training. More than 12,000 students and university staff have been trained by the union since 1994. Thus far, the attention has focused on students who are studying to become teachers or social workers, but the University of Ulster recently extended diversity training to student union sabbatical officers, with plans to provide diversity training to the general student body from 2005.</p> <p>\"Sectarianism is one problem in Northern Ireland,\" says Anne Monaghan, community relations manager at the university. \"But we also have more and more students coming to us from diverse backgrounds, including international students. We don't see our role at the university as just being educational. We also feel we have a social and civic responsibility to promote good community relations and citizenship values.\"</p>",
  "The independent candidate, Ralph Nader, limped into the home stretch of his presidential campaign yesterday, with barely 1% of voters behind him. <p>Despite a huge collapse in support compared to 2000 and little organisation on the ground, Mr Nader's meagre showing could still prove a decisive factor in a tight race. </p> <p>\"The reality is the Nader factor is arguably still there,\" Chris Kofinis, senior adviser to the anti-Nader group TheNaderFactor.com told the Associated Press. \"But we've been incredibly successful at minimising it in part because of Nader's own failings and in part because people don't buy his message anymore.\" </p> <p>Democrats accuse Mr Nader, an anti-corporate crusader, of handing the election to George Bush in 2000 by siphoning votes that would have gone to Al Gore. Mr Nader, who gained 2.7% of the vote nationwide, won more than the margin between Mr Gore and Mr Bush in New Hampshire and Florida. </p> <p>Exit polls from 2000 show that two thirds of those who voted for Mr Nader would not have voted otherwise and Mr Nader replies that he took more votes from Republicans in New Hampshire and Mr Gore was defeated because he could not win his own state, Tennessee. </p> <p>But many prominent left wingers who backed Mr Nader in 2000, including Noam Chomsky and Michael Moore, have abandoned him this year, arguing that his candidacy will be counterproductive. </p> <p>Democrats have successfully sought to keep Mr Nader off the ballot around the country by challenging the signatures he has submitted. Mr Nader has condemned \"dirty tricks, harassment and intimidation\" by Democrats. </p> <p>\"If you're not willing to lose in politics, and fight and lose again, and fight and lose again, your agenda will never prevail,\" he said last week. </p> <p>He will still be running in many battleground states, including Florida, Minnesota, Iowa and New Hampshire where the race between Mr Bush and Mr Kerry is effectively tied. </p> <p>But in many of the areas where he performed best last time, such as Minnesota and Colorado where he attracted 5% of the vote, his support has effectively collapsed, bumping along between 1% and the asterisk of an also ran. </p> <p>Polls vary on whom Mr Nader hurts most. A recent Gallup poll suggested 52% of those backing him would otherwise vote Republican, as opposed to 48% who would go to the Democrats. Others have shown his voters favouring Mr Kerry to Mr Bush by three to one.</p>"
