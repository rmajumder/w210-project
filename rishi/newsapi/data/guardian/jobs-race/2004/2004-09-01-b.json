  "<p>Steve Harmison took only the second hat-trick in England's one-day international history as the home side swept India aside in the first match of the NatWest Challenge series at Trent Bridge.</p> <p>The Durham paceman took the final three wickets of Mohammad Kaif, Lakshimpathy Balaji and Ashish Nehra to become the first international bowler to take a one-day hat-trick since James Anderson cleaned up the Pakistan tail at The Oval last summer. Vikram Solanki then hit a fluid half-century to mark his return to the side, and lead England to a comfortable seven-wicket victory.</p> <p>The other new face in the side, Alex Wharf, earlier bowled brilliantly to rip the heart out of the Indian batting line-up and claim figures of 3 for 30. The late call-up to the team after the withdrawal of Kabir Ali made an immediate impact by dismissing Sourav Ganguly with his fifth ball, just as the India captain and VVS Laxman were building a threatening stand.</p> <p>Wharf followed up with the wickets of Laxman and Rahul Dravid in consecutive overs, and the England bowlers continued to pile pressure on the Indians, evidenced by Ashley Giles's accurate 10-over spell, which included the wicket of Irfan Pathan and not a single boundary. </p> <p>Kaif led a mini fightback with a fine half-century, before he became the first of Harmison's victims. The rest of the tail were unable to resist the world's No1 Test bowler, leaving six overs unaccounted for.</p> <p>Solanki and Marcus Trescothick wasted no time in setting about their target of 171, spraying Pathan and Nehra to all parts of the ground before the Somerset opener fell to Balaji for 33. Balaji then bowled Michael Vaughan to extend the England captain's dismal run in one-day internationals: Vaughan has scored just 61 runs in his last seven ODIs.</p> <p>When Pathan trapped Solanki lbw for 52, the crowd got what they wanted: an Andrew Flintoff cameo. The Lancastrian slugger smashed a quickfire 34 off 23 balls, hitting a six to round off the win with more than 17 overs to spare.</p>",
  "Champion jockey Kieren Fallon is one of the three jockeys arrested today as part of an investigation into alleged race fixing <p>Fergal Lynch and Darren Williams have been named as the other two, together with trainer Karl Burke. </p> <p>More than 130 officers raided 19 addresses across Suffolk, North Yorkshire and South Yorkshire. Police suspect widespread corruption involving more than 80 races over the last two years.</p> <p>\"Of the people we have arrested three are jockeys and one is a horse trainer,\" said detective chief superintendent Steve Wilmott, of City of London police, which is co-ordinating the case. \"We have amassed a large amount of information, including computer records and documentation seized today, and will now commence the detailed task of examining it all.\" </p> <p>\"This case is of great national significance,\" added assistant commissioner Mike Bowron added: not just to the racing community but to the wider public throughout the UK.\" </p> <p>John Blake, chief executive of the Jockeys Association, was quoted by the BBC as saying: \"These are serious issues and are very damaging to the reputation of racing.\"</p> <p>Today's arrests come as a fresh blow to the reputation of the racing scene after a series of high-profile controversies. A 2002 investigation by the BBC's Panorama programme led to the resignation of Jockey Club security chief Jeremy Phipps.</p> <p>A report by the News of the World earlier this year led to a Jockey Club inquiry into disrepute charges against Fallon and John Egan, which was due to start in September but has been delayed.</p> <p>In a four-page article published on March 7 and described as the \"sports scandal of the decade\", the paper alleged that Fallon told undercover journalists before a race at Lingfield that eventual winner Rye would beat his mount Ballinger Ridge. </p> <p>Fallon was found guilty of not riding out for first place on Ballinger Ridge, which was beaten a short head by Rye, and he served a 21-day suspension for the offence. Both jockeys have insisted they are innocent of allegations of race-fixing. </p> <p>Another rider, Sean Fox, is to appear before the Jockey Club disciplinary panel on September 10 to appeal against a 21-day ban for his ride on Ice Saint at Fontwell in March. Local stewards found him guilty of breaching a racing rule after they decided he intentionally stepped off the horse at the Sussex track. </p> <p>The Jockey Club's security department launched an investigation into the race and public relations director John Maxse revealed that information gained from that investigation may be used in separate proceedings. </p> <p>Former jockey-turned-bloodstock agent Graham Bradley is waiting to hear the outcome of his High Court appeal against a five-year ban imposed after he gave evidence at a drugs trial. Bradley, 44, claims the April 2003 disqualification order by the Jockey Club's disciplinary committee and appeal board is unlawful. </p> <p>The order bans Bradley from entering any racecourse or premises owned, used or licensed by the Club and from dealing in any capacity with a racehorse. </p> <p>It was imposed in the wake of his appearance at Southampton Crown Court in September 2001 when he gave evidence at the trial of a friend who was later acquitted of drugs charges. </p> <p>During his evidence, Bradley stated that he had received presents in the form of nights out and the occasional flight, and cash payments, from a man called Brian Wright in return for privileged racing information. Mr Justice Richards reserved judgment in June and is due to give his decision in writing.</p>",
  "<p>National Grid Transco, the pipes and pylons company, yesterday announced a \u00a36bn deal to sell half its gas distribution business. The move pleased the City but alarmed unions and consumer groups.</p> <p>One of the biggest cash deals to date in Britain raised fears about safety, job losses and profiteering, with shareholders benefiting from a \u00a32bn windfall worth 65p a share.</p> <p>Foreign firms such as Cheung Kong of Hong Kong, Borealis of Canada and Macquarie of Australia are among those that paid a 20% premium to a regulatory asset value given the gas businesses.</p> <p>They have joined up with better-known British utilities such as Scottish &amp; Southern Energy and United Utilities to take over the gas pipes and storage holders in four regions - Scotland, Wales and the west, the north and the south of England.</p> <p>NGT will hang on to the four businesses that provide services to 11m customers in the rest of England - including London and the West Midlands - and which have a regulatory asset value of \u00a35.6bn.</p> <p>The eight energy networks take gas from NGT's high pressure national transmission system and transport it through 275,000 kilometres of pipelines to 21m businesses and homes.</p> <p>Sir John Parker, the NGT chairman, said he was \"delighted\" at the price achieved.</p> <p>\"The fact that these sales will also bring customer benefits makes this a positive outcome for all parties,\" he added.</p> <p>NGT believes that further fragmentation of gas supply will increase competition and drive down prices, a view shared in part by energy regulator Ofgem, which must still pass judgment on the deal.</p> <p>But Energywatch, the consumer watchdog, expressed astonishment at the scale of the windfall. \"Not only are shareholders at NGT set for a bonanza, the buyers of the networks will expect to generate even more value from their new purchases,\" said Allan Asher, the group's chief executive.</p> <p>\"Before this deal goes through, we want to know why the value has shot up and what the consequences for consumers are likely to be,\" he said.</p> <p>Unions representing thousands of workers at NGT warned of possible strikes over the sale, which they claimed would lead to higher prices.</p> <p>\"We also have serious concerns about the integrity and safety of the gas system if it is broken up and put into the hands of new players. Of course, there will be an effect on the cost of gas,\" said GMB national officer Brian Strutton.</p> <p>But NGT sought to play down worries, saying there was no question of safety being compromised. A national emergency helpline in the event of gas leaks is to be maintained, although its engineers will be employed by local firms.</p> <p>NGT said it would retain 4,800 staff while 4,200 would move over to new employers under existing pension arrangements. New pension liabilities would be shared between NGT and new buyers.</p> <p>The \u00a35.8bn cash payment - which comes with \u00a3130m of assumed environmental and other liabilities - will be used for giving money back to shareholders but also for paying down debt.</p> <p>NGT believes it can thrive on a smaller but higher value gas distribution network and invest elsewhere. It has its eye on further acquisitions in the United States, where it is benefiting from more relaxed regulation in which price controls are fixed for up to 20 years.</p> <p>\"We would certainly wish to participate in any [US] consolidation,\" said chief executive Roger Urwin.</p> <p>The company also plans to increase the dividend during the current year by 20% and will then revert to a 7% a year target up to 2008. Shares in NGT closed unchanged, at 463.75p, but had already risen 8% this month in anticipation of a cash bonanza.</p> <p>German bank WestLB upgraded its rating on NGT to neutral from underperform on the back of the higher than expected proceeds from the sale of the assets. The share target was raised from 420p to 480p.</p> <p>The gas distribution deals are still subject to approval from trade secretary Patricia Hewitt, the markets authority and the Health and Safety Executive.</p>",
  "<p>Lord Black plundered his former company, Hollinger International, the then owner of the Daily Telegraph, on a vast scale, according to a 500-page report published yesterday.</p> <p>The document, the result of a yearlong internal investigation, embellishes an earlier $1.25bn lawsuit against Lord Black and other former executives of the company, accusing them of extraordinary greed.</p> <p>According to the latest report, Lord Black charged the company almost $43,000 (\u00a327,000) for a birthday party he threw for his wife Barbara Amiel at New York's La Grenouille restaurant. Celebrity guests, including Oscar de la Renta, Barbara Walters and Ron Perelman, enjoyed Beluga caviar and lobster.</p> <p>The couple also claimed as expenses $2,463 for Lady Black's handbags, $3,530 for silverware for the Blacks' corporate jet and $24,950 for \"summer drinks\".</p> <p>Publication of the long-awaited report could accelerate parallel investigations by US criminal and financial authorities.</p> <p>Lord Black and a small coterie, including the former deputy chairman of the company, David Radler, have been accused of skimming more than $400m from the business in the past seven years. The lawsuit, including damages, is for three times that amount.</p> <p>They have been accused of taking excessive compensation, unapproved bonuses, fees and loans, and selling themselves assets from the company at bargain prices, as well as the headline grabbing personal expenses.</p> <p>\"Black and Radler made it their business to line their pockets at the expense of Hollinger almost every day, in almost every way they could devise,\" the internal report says.</p> <p>It claims that Lord Black set in place a system \"to plunder Hollinger on a vast scale\"; that \"abusive and unethical practices had become so deeply ingrained in the corporate culture they became commonplace\"; and that Lord Black had a \"parasitic\" relationship with the business.</p> <p>The report also singles out a former US assistant secretary of defence, Richard Perle, who sat on the Hollinger International board, for particular criticism. It hints that the company may launch a separate legal claim against him to claim back money he earned as a director.</p> <p>Mr Perle was accused of a \"head-in-the-sand\" mentality, rubber-stamping Lord Black's actions while being awarded a $3m bonus.</p> <p>Members of the company's audit committee, who signed off many of the millions of dollars in fees collected by Lord Black, also came in for criticism. Other high profile directors, including the former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger, emerged with their reputations intact.</p> <p>The report is also strongly critical of the outside auditors, KPMG. It claims the accounting firm initially resisted efforts by the investigators, an allegation denied by KPMG. Hollinger International had no comment on whether further lawsuits would be filed.</p> <p>A spokesman for KPMG said yesterday: \"We believe that we cooperated fully with the investigation throughout its entirety.\"</p> <p>Hollinger International did suggest however that the size of the claim already filed that names Lord Black could go higher still as the company begins the discovery process and gains access to documents held by the fallen tycoon.</p> <p>Lord Black, who was ousted from the company in January, has vehemently denied any wrongdoing.</p> <p>He has launched a defamation suit against the company alleging that it attempted to turn him into a \"loathsome laughing stock\".</p> <p>A statement from Lord Black's privately held Ravelston Group said the report was \"recycling the same exaggerated claims laced with outright lies\" and said the accused would be exonerated in court.</p> <p>The first mutterings of financial scandal at Hollinger International were heard last summer when a shareholder complained of \"non-compete\" bonuses paid to Lord Black and other executives when the company sold some of its assets. That set in train one of the most ugly internecine battles seen, even in the newspaper business.</p> <p>Hollinger engaged Richard Breeden, a former head of the US financial watchdog, the securities and exchange commission, to investigate. Initial findings last November suggested that at least $32m had been misappropriated, a figure that grew as the investigation continued.</p> <p>The committee led by Mr Breeden interviewed more than 60 witnesses and reviewed nearly 750,000 pages of documents in the course of the investigation.</p>",
  "<p>Lord Black, according to the long-awaited internal report into the financial scandal at Hollinger International, was the architect of his own downfall.</p> <p>\"Black called the shots, and he wanted a board filled with prominent people who wouldn't make waves,\" it read. \"Black got what he wanted, until he pushed so far beyond the limits of acceptable behaviour that he triggered the formation of the special committee and its investigative process.\"</p> <p>The committee, led by former SEC chief Richard Breeden, paints a now familiar picture of Hollinger as a firm ruled by a tyrant who took what he wanted with scant regard for the business or other shareholders.</p> <p>Lord Black and a handful of others are accused of looting the former Telegraph owner of more than $400m (\u00a3221m) through excessive compensation, unapproved bonuses, non-compete fees, loans and personal expenses.</p> <p>Further allegations of his extravagance emerge in the 500-page document, as do further instances of extreme audacity.</p> <p>When Lord Black was putting together the $2.1bn sale of Canadian publications to CanWest, he is said to have arranged a side deal for an annual $3.9m in ongoing \"management fees\" to be paid to his private firm Ravelston, in return for lowering the sale price by $39m.</p> <p>In typically pompous fashion, he is cited elsewhere in the report writing to vice-chairman David Radler of the \"splendid conveyance of the non-competition agreements from which you and I profited so well ...\"</p> <p>But shareholders are looking beyond titillating headlines. The report opens new avenues of questioning, related to the members of the audit committee, to Richard Perle, the only \"independent\" member of the executive committee, and to outside audit firm KPMG.</p> <p>The special committee suggests the audit committee is partly to blame, despite Lord Black and Mr Radler keeping information from them. The report describes the committee as \"careless\" and \"inert and ineffective\" and refers to its \"somnolence\".</p> <p>Their performance in reviewing non-compete payments to Lord Black and others \"was unacceptable\" and failed to question the $225m in management fees paid to Ravelston during the period in question.</p> <p>\"The board Black selected functioned more like a social club or public policy association than the board of a major corporation, enjoying extremely short meetings followed by a good lunch and discussion of world affairs.\" When one director questioned him, \"Black hissed, 'this is my company',\" the report said.</p> <p>In one 65-minute meeting Lord Black and Mr Radler won approval for $38m in management fees to themselves, paid via Ravelston, an incentive plan for the firm's digital division worth $5.3m to the \"senior executive group\" and the sale for $1 of two newspapers to a firm controlled by the two men.</p> <p>The report accused auditor KPMG of granting access to its papers very late in the inquiry. The auditors only allowed the investigators to review papers held by its Canadian arm, where Lord Black's holding companies are based. KPMG denied it obfuscated, noting the complexity of the inquiry.</p> <p>More damning was the suggestion that KPMG failed to properly advise the audit committee. The report found KPMG, along with law firm Torys, failed to tell the audit committee whether certain management fees and non-compete clauses had violated financial standards. These failures partly justified the audit committee's apparent laxity over fees paid to Lord Black and his associates. They also went some way in absolving directors Henry Kissinger and Shmuel Meitar, who were not on the audit committee.</p> <p>Only Richard Perle, a former US defence adviser closely associated with the Bush administration, was accused of enriching himself at the expense of the company. As the former chairman and chief executive of Hollinger Digital, Mr Perle received more than $3m in bonuses on top of his salary.</p> <p>He breached his fiduciary duties by signing unanimous consents without reading the documents; several apparently authorised the controversial transactions. The report said he should return all money he earned while at the company.</p> <p>Shareholder Tweedy Browne, which controls 18% of Hollinger and is also threatening legal action, said the report was a \"step in the right direction\". The fund manager's Laura Jereski said: \"We still have a long way to go before the special committee completes its obligations to shareholders ... to secure large chunks of cash for the benefit of all shareholders. The responsibility for allowing the money to leave rests with the board.\"</p> <p>Investigations are still going on at the SEC and the department of justice. There were suggestions the SEC had sent notices to former members of the company to the effect that it is preparing to file charges. The SEC made no comment.</p> <p>Hollinger has filed a $1.25bn lawsuit naming Lord Black, Mr Radler and others; the sum is three times the $400m the firm claims was taken. That suit has been held up until publication of the report. Hollinger lawyers will now gain access to documents held by Ravelston, and the chance to depose Lord Black, Mr Radler and others who refused to give interviews during the internal inquiry.</p> <p>Ravelston, representing Lord Black and Mr Radler, again asserted their innocence. \"Mr Breeden and the special committee have squandered more than $25m of shareholders' money in a futile 14-month investigation that paralysed Hollinger International, eroded the value of its assets and persecuted and defamed those who created the value they are now vandalising,\" it said.</p> <p>Hollinger has told the court it hopes to finish discovery by December; Lord Black's lawyers argue they need until next July.
