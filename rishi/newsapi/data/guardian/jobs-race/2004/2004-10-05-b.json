  "The Q Awards did little to dispel their reputation as a prize-giving ceremony for skinny white boys with guitars when a list of unrelentingly male, white and guitar-driven winners was announced yesterday. <p>Though the 2004 shortlist featured a mildly more diverse range of acts, including Kelis, The Streets, Dizzee Rascal and Outkast, it was left to the Birmingham-born chanteuse Jamelia to tick the boxes as both the only woman and the only member of an ethnic minority to win an award.</p> <p>She won best single for See it in a Boy's Eyes, adding to the clutch of prizes she gathered at last week's Mobo awards.</p> <p>\"It's pretty sad that Jamelia is the only black and only female artist on that list,\" said Ivor Etienne, programme controller of the urban music station Choice FM.</p> <p>\"It doesn't really represent the urban side of the British music scene. I would have liked to have seen Dizzee Rascal, Lemar, maybe Joss Stone in there, to show that there are types of music other than guitar bands.</p> <p>\"When you think how urban music has dominated the market in the last year. I would imagine urban music has registered more number ones, more top fives, than any other kind of music. It's a pity to make it so narrow and limited.\"</p> <p>The title of best act in the world today went to the American rock act Red Hot Chili Peppers.</p> <p>Keane took best album for their hugely successful debut Hopes and Fears, and the best live act went to Muse, who headlined on the final night of this year's Glastonbury festival.</p> <p>It was a list packed with rock mainstays: Roxy Music and U2 won the lifetime achievement award and the Q icon award respectively, Elton John the classic songwriting prize. Awards also went to the Pet Shop Boys and the Human League.</p> <p>This meant a disappointing absence of new music. Razorlight were named best new act and the Libertines were indirectly honoured by the former Clash guitarist Mick Jones being named best producer for his work on their self-titled second album.</p> <p>Nominated for four awards, the Glaswegian art-rockers Franz Ferdinand walked away with just one prize: best video, for their single Take Me Out.</p> <p>Q magazine was founded in 1986, and its annual awards in 1990. The magazine, TV, radio, and website have a combined audience of about 5 million.</p> <p>\"Q is a credible magazine,\" Mr Etienne said, \"and it features credible urban artists, like your Beverley Knights, your Jamelias and your Dizzee Rascals. It would have been nice to see that reflected in the awards.\"</p> <p><b>Winners' lineup</b><br></p> <p><b>Best new act </b> Razorlight<br> </p> <p>Razorlight's debut album, the blistering Up All Night, along with their legendary live performances, has brought the band a loyal following. </p> <p> </p> <p><b>Best video</b> Franz Ferdinand<br> </p> <p>Glaswegians Franz Ferdinand have achieved cult status for impeccable attire and guitar music you can dance to. </p> <p> </p> <p><b>Best single</b> Jamelia<br> </p> <p><b>See It In A Boy's Eyes</b> </p> <p>The 23-year-old Birmingham-born star emerged on the British music scene five years ago. Last week she scooped three awards at the Music of Black Origin ceremony. </p> <p> </p> <p><b>The Q classic songwriter award </b> Elton John<br> </p> <p>Famous for three decades of hits, John has influenced many contemporary artists. </p> <p> <b>The Q icon award</b> U2<br> </p> <p>Irish rockers U2 have been notably absent from the music scene. Their next studio album, How to Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, is out this year. </p> <p><b>The Q lifetime achievement award </b> Roxy Music<br></p> <p>The judges praised the band's contribution to \"fashion, style and glamour\" as well as to music.</p>"
