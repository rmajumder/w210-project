  "1) The first black people in Britain were probably <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/society_culture/multicultural/dabbott_01.shtml\">Roman</a> soldiers. <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimius_Severus\"> Septimius Severus </a>, of North African descent, was the first black Roman emperor. <p>2) <a href=\"http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/nefertiti/nefertiti.html \"> Nefertiti </a>, queen of Egypt, co-ruled her country between 1379 and 1358 BC. She was rumoured to have been the world's most beautiful woman in her time. Nefertiti (whose name literally means \"a beautiful woman has arrived\") was the daughter of Ay (who became pharaoh after<a href=\"http://homepage.powerup.com.au/~ancient/tut2.htm\"> Tutankhamun's</a> death) and the wife of another pharaoh, <a href=\"http://www.heptune.com/Marfans.html\"> Akhenaten</a>.</p> <p>3) Records show that small numbers of black men and women lived in Britain in the 12th century, but the black population began to expand rapidly in the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/society_culture/multicultural/black_britons_01.shtml\">17th</a> and 18th centuries, thanks to the expansion of the British empire.</p> <p> 4) Mary <a href=\" http://www.100greatblackbritons.com/bios/mary_seacole.html\">Seacole</a>, a pioneering nurse and heroine of the Crimean war came first in last year's top 100 great black Britons poll. Denied the opportunity to work with Florence Nightingale, she travelled east on her own to minister to wounded British soldiers.</p> <p> 5) Between about 1500 and 1870 it is estimated that at least 12 million African people were forcibly shipped across the Atlantic to work as<a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAslavery.htm\"> slaves in the Americas</a>. </p> <p> 6) Britain traded in African slaves for three hundred years on its way to becoming a world economic power. The slave trade helped finance the industrial revolution and many British businesses, such as Lloyd's insurance market, Imperial Tobacco and <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/U/untold/\">Midland Bank</a> grew out of the slave trade. </p> <p>7) To support its colonies, Britain also had the largest fleet of slave ships, mostly operating out of <a href=\"http://www.brainyencyclopedia.com/encyclopedia/s/sl/slave_trade.html \">Bristol</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1p318.html\">Liverpool</a> and <a href=\"http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConNarrative.103/London-and-the-transatlantic-slave-trade.html\">London </a>. Slave trading played a very important economic role in all three cities.</p> <p> 8) It was not just through slavery that Britain profited from the inhabitants of its colonies. The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/war/wwone/india_wwone_01.shtml\">Indian</a> army fought in every major theatre of operations during <a href=\"http://www.regiments.org/wars/ww1/ww1index.htm\">the first world war</a>. In August 1914, it sent 161,000 soldiers to the western front in France, suffering heavy losses and providing half the attacking force at the <a href=\"http://www.lib.byu.edu/~rdh/wwi/1915/neuvecha.html\"> battle of Neuve Chapelle </a>.</p> <p>9) <a href=\"http://www.black-history-month.co.uk/home.html\">Black history month</a> is held every October in Britain. It was inspired by the efforts of <a href=\"http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/blackhis/woodson.htm\">Carter G Woodson</a>, known by many as the \"father of black history\". He established Negro History Week in the US in 1926 and the event was expanded to become Black History Month in the 60s. He was also the editor of the <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/journals/00222992.html\">Journal of Negro History</a> for 30 years, having produced the first issue of the publication with his own money.</p> <p>10) Events planned for the UK this year include a photographic exhibition charting the history of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/events/mobos/\">black music </a>in the UK, to be held at the GLA City Hall in central London.</p>",
  "<p>Mr Blair, according to the Daily Mirror, eats two black bananas at lunchtime in the belief that some ingredient in the overripe fruit helps boost his energy levels, keeping him going on just five hours sleep a night. </p> <p>But as an energy-boosting strategy, the black banana diet is greeted with bemusement by experts. \"I don't know of any magical properties of black bananas that would really boost your energy levels after a lack of sleep,\" says Amanda Johnson, of the British Dietetic Association. </p> <p>Bananas, whether they be yellow or black, are undoubtedly a good source of energy if you need staying power. Sugary foods may produce a hard and fast energy rush, but it is always followed by a dip that can leave you feeling sluggish. Bananas are digested more slowly and release their energy steadily. </p> <p>Bananas are high in starch, but as they ripen, the carbohydrate is broken down by enzymes. At the same time, the amount of sugar in the fruit increases, explaining why ripe fruit can taste sweeter. Although these changes are measurable, they would have at most a negligible effect on how energy is released from the fruit when eaten. \"When you look at the whole context of physiology and other foods you eat, it won't have a noticeable impact on digestibility or energy release,\" says Johnson. Scientists at the Medical Research Council's Human Nutrition Research Centre in Cambridge agreed, adding that little research has been carried out on the nutritional content of very ripe fruit. </p> <p>Downing Street was unable to confirm whether Mr Blair has indeed become a fan of black bananas, or on what science the strategy was based. \"What the prime minister eats is a personal matter.\"</p>"
