  "Soldiers of the Black Watch regiment were yesterday finalising preparations for their controversial deployment deeper into Iraq, as the political row over their transfer showed no signs of abating. <p>At a special service at their southern base near Basra, the 800 troops took to the parade ground and listened to a sermon as their commanders insisted they were up for the job.</p> <p>But a poll in yesterday's Mail on Sunday showed public disquiet at the government's decision to acquiesce to Amer ica's request for the troops to fill in for US forces nearer Baghdad. The survey found that almost two-thirds of voters opposed the plans.</p> <p>The US military had asked for the soldiers of the 1st Battalion Black Watch to cover for American troops who are expected to take part in offensives against insurgent strongholds west and north of the capital, including Falluja.</p> <p>Lieutenant Colonel James Cowan, of the Black Watch, said yesterday that the battalion was \"fully prepared to take part in any operations to defend Iraq's freedom along side multinational troops\". He added that 500 troops and 350 support staff were expected to move northward to a base at Hilla, about 95 kilometres south of Baghdad. The Scots are equipped with 119 military vehicles, including tanks, and carry automatic rifles, mortars and medium and heavy artillery.</p> <p>Lt Col Cowan did not say when the Black Watch soldiers would leave for Hillah or if they would remain at the base near the ancient city of Babylon, but preparations are at an advanced stage.</p> <p>Major Blair Radford told BBC News that his men were happy with their mission and readying themselves for it. \"We have been here in times of relative calm stability and at times we have had bouts of violence,\" he said. \"I think we are well prepared for what comes.\"</p> <p>The UK government has insisted the troops' deployment is a purely military matter, part of the coalition effort to bring order to Iraq before elections in January. But their secondment to a more volatile region under US command has caused an outcry, despite the prime minister's protestations that it was a practical and not political move, and his promise that the troops would be home for Christmas.</p> <p>Prayers for the troops' safe return were said at churches across the Black Watch regiment's key recruiting grounds in Scotland yesterday. On Saturday, relatives of some of the troops in the deployment joined hundreds of people at a rally in Dundee to protest against government proposals to merge Scotland's regiments.</p> <p>Alex Salmond, the leader of the Scottish National party, said it was a disgrace that the troops were being put at risk in Iraq when their regiments were under threat.</p> <p>\"No adult Scot should accept the situation when our young men and women are placed in the line of fire by a government and then stabbed in the back by the same government through amalgamations,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Staff at the BBC are bracing themselves for a \"very tough year\" as the new director general Mark Thompson prepares to axe up to 6,000 jobs to show the government that the corporation is taking the necessary \"self-help\" measures to earn a new charter.</p> <p>The drastic job cuts are being described officially as \"speculative\" by the corporation but the unions fear thousands of livelihoods are at risk.</p> <p>BBC managers have already held preliminary talks with the broadcasting union, Bectu, which says its officials have not yet been given a clear indication of the scale of the cuts likely to result from Mr Thompson's review of the corporation.</p> <p>\"The BBC attitude seems to be to do to itself what it thinks the government might otherwise do by statute or under the new charter,\" said an insider.</p> <p>\"We are expecting a very tough year ahead,\" said the Bectu president, Tony Lennon.</p> <p>Mr Thompson announced four major reviews on his first day as director general back in June, looking at the BBC's commercial activities, plans to move significant numbers of staff to an enlarged broadcasting and production base in Manchester, production and commissioning at TV Centre in London and a separate move to cut costs across the organisation.</p> <p>All four reviews are likely to result in job cuts. However, in the case of the Manchester investigation, any loss of posts in London should be counter-balanced by the creation of new positions in the north west.</p> <p>Bectu officials believe the bulk of any job losses will result from the review of commissioning and production and the \"value for money\" cost-cutting drive.</p> <p>\"We think the leaders of the four reviews have reached a point where they are looking at options, but no final decisions have been taken. It looks like decisions will be taken in November before the review findings go before the executive committee and the board of governors,\" a Bectu source said.</p> <p>The number of staff at the BBC swelled by 4,000 under Mr Thompson's predecessor, Greg Dyke. </p> <p>When he took over in the year ending March 1, 2000, the BBC had 23,640 staff on its books. When Mr Dyke left in February, the corporation was employing 27,632.</p> <p>A BBC spokesman refused to deny talk of 6,000 job losses, describing reports as \"highly speculative\", but admitted more than 1,000 posts were likely to go once the results of the various reviews are published.</p> <p>\"It is true that we are not just talking about 100s [of job cuts]. We are looking for significant savings,\" he said.</p> <p>The review of BBC TV commissioning and production could cause major job losses in the corporation's in-house programme-making departments.</p> <p>A proposal that could reduce the proportion of the BBC's TV output produced in-house to 50% - from the current level of more than 70% - was put forward by independent producers' trade body, Pact, and is understood to have been given serious consideration by executives at the corporation.</p> <p>The BBC board of governors has separately called in Ernst &amp; Young to investigate to investigate day-to-day expenditure, including examining whether shows made in-house are produced as cost-effectively as those made by the independent sector.</p> <p>The BBC chief operating officer, John Smith, who is leading the commercial review, last week ruled out a wholesale sale of BBC Worldwide, the subsidiary responsible for programme sales, merchandising and book and magazine publishing.</p> <p>However, Mr Smith did not rule out the possibility of other BBC commercial subsidiaries - studios, the post-production operation BBC Resources, and channel branding and playout unit BBC Broadcast - being spun off as joint ventures with private sector partners. Any such move would be likely to result in job cuts in the commercial areas affected.</p> <p>The review of costs, which is targeting the BBC's annual overheads of \u00a3320m, could lead to job losses across all areas of the corporation.</p> <p>BBC News is looking for significant cuts - one of the cost-cutting measures under consideration is reducing the number of video agency contracts from two to one.</p> <p>Last week MediaGuardian.co.uk reported how the head of news gathering, Adrian van Klaveren, was looking at dropping Reuters news picture feeds completely to save up to \u00a33m a year.</p> <p>Few expect the BBC to drop Reuters or its rival, APTN, because to do so would leave the corporation vulnerable to missing international stories but insiders say such a suggestion is a measure of the severity of cost-cutting expected by Mr Thompson.</p> <p>Another well-placed source in an other part of the organisation said: \"I have never seen financial controls being introduced with such force as they were the week Mark Thompson arrived.\"</p> <p>Other areas reported to be under threat from the review include the BBC's human resources department and the online and interactive operation.</p> <p>The BBC said the results of the four reviews would be announced by early December.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>The final scramble for places on next season's European circuit saw Richard Sterne rescue his tour card in brilliant fashion yesterday by winning the Madrid Open with a closing 65. </p> <p>With the Australian Wade Ormsby shooting 66 to claim a share of sixth place and save his place on the circuit as well, his compatriot Jarrod Moseley and England's Simon Wakefield paid dear for missing the cut. They will have to go to next month's qualifying school to win back their cards. </p> <p>Incredibly, Moseley finished less than \u00a310 behind Robert Karlsson in the order of merit. But by surviving the cut at Club de Campo, the Swede pushed Moseley into the drop zone, despite the Australian earning more than \u00a3100,000 this year. </p> <p>The South African Sterne arrived in the Spanish capital 122nd in the order of merit, needing to climb six spots to ensure his tour spot. Now, after finishing two strokes ahead of Anders Hansen, he has earned himself a two-year exemption. </p> <p>Seve Ballesteros, the tournament host, described Sterne's performance as \"unbelievable, outstanding\". The 23-year-old's 31 on the front nine, including an eagle and three birdies, was the joint best of the day. </p> <p>Sterne started the day one of four players one stroke off the lead, jointly held by his compatriot Darren Fichardt and the Englishman Paul Broadhurst, but took over the lead on his own when Fichardt double-bogeyed the 385-yard 8th. It was a lead Sterne never let go, adding a birdie on the long 14th and closing with four pars for an 18-under total of 266 and a winner's cheque of \u00a3115,225 - \u00a324,000 more than he earned in the rest of the season. </p> <p>Ormsby began the week 125th on the money list and was equally thrilled after his 66. Needing to par the last to avoid going back to school, he sank a 10-foot putt for birdie. </p> <p>Whereas Moseley and Wakefield learnt their fate away from the event, there were more hard-luck stories at the course. Johan Edfors and Ivo Giner had to finish first or second to keep their cards and were both in position to do it, but they dropped to ninth and sixth respectively. </p> <p>Edfors was leading with a hole to play in his third round when he suffered a lost ball off the tee. Only after he had gone back to the tee and double-bogeyed the hole did a spectator come forward to say she had seen the ball being lifted. \"I would have paid a lot for that ball,\" said the Swede. </p> <p>The former Dunhill Cup winner Jamie Spence, chairman of the players' committee, finished joint 30th and lost his card by three shots. </p> <p>Wakefield, meanwhile, will remember the last hole of The Heritage tournament a month ago. Lying fourth, he hooked out of bounds and a bogey six cost him \u00a317,000. Eventually, it also cost him his card.</p>"
