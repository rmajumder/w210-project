  "A bitter row has erupted in the Bradford Conservative Party after Asian members claimed that they were subjected to 'openly racist remarks', including being called 'thieves' and 'drug smugglers'. <p>At least two senior Asian party officers have contacted the Commission for Racial Equality and are threatening to take legal action against the Conservative Party for racial discrimination. </p> <p>Conservative Central Office has now suspended the party to investigate claims of racism and corruption after more than 50 members of the local party demanded action from Tory leader Michael Howard. </p> <p>A dossier of letters sent to Howard and Tory chairman Dr Liam Fox detailing allegations of racism has been obtained by The Observer. In one letter, a Tory member is described as having 'views worse than the BNP'. A separate criticism is that the former chairman of the local party, David Brown, resigned at an executive meeting after an Asian candidate, Haroon Rashid, was selected to fight the next general election. It is claimed he said he could not support an ethnic community candidate and that he had been promised a white candidate. </p> <p>One of those who has written to Howard listing the allegations is Alyas Khan, the deputy chairman of the Bradford West Conservative Association. Khan joined the party in 1982 and is one of the longest-serving Asian members of the party. He would not comment on the claims while the complaint was under investigation. </p> <p>Ahmed Rashid, party treasurer in Bradford, who also wrote to Central Office detailing claims of racism, said: 'The issues are serious and I have heard members openly use racist remarks that are intolerable. The promise of a white candidate for the seat, I believe, is also against the law.' </p> <p>Another Asian member of the party who wished to remain anonymous said: 'I joined the party because I shared its values. I know politics can be filthy but I was unprepared for some of the extreme views I heard... We are hoping to go into government but we need to get our own house in order first.' </p> <p>The dossier seen by The Observer reveals the race row openly surfaced in October last year when the party selected Rashid, a British Airways executive, as its candidate to fight the seat. White activists within the party were backing Simon Cooke, the deputy leader of Bradford council, who made a Nazi salute and called out 'Sieg Heil' at the end of a speech by German-born Labour councillor during a council debate. No action was taken against Cooke, who apologised afterwards. </p> <p>Six months after Rashid was selected he was a target for a sting by the News of the World. Rashid was secretly videoed allegedly admitting to rigging the selection vote. It was suggested he has used family members to vote who lived outside the area and got a friend to vote in the name of somebody who had been dead for seven years. </p> <p>Rashid, who is a brother of the party treasurer, denied the claims but was suspended and is the subject of a Central Office investigation. Some factions in the party believe the tabloid sting was helped by rogue elements within the Tory party. </p> <p>Whoever was responsible set in train a bitter battle of control of the party between white and the 200-plus Asian members, who are in the majority. John Hardy, secretary of the Bradford party, has been trying to mediate between the two sides.He pointed out that in the last two general elections the party had fielded a candidate from the ethnic community who had not won, so there was a genuine debate as to whether a white candidate would fare better. </p> <p>However, he said: 'I wish it was true that race was not an issue in this whole business, but it is. There are strong views from both white and Asian members of the party.' </p> <p>A spokesman from the Conservative Central Office said they could not comment until the party's investigation was concluded. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:antony.barnett@observer.co.uk\">antony.barnett@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Any good editor knows who his or her readers are, of course: but he or she also has to know who they think they are. Say jockeys, polo players, chefs and auctioneers, what you might call 'people from all walks of life' if you were the editor of the Daily Mail . </p> <p>The media joy of the Westminster invasion wasn't eight men in white T-shirts taking on rather a larger number of men in tights. (Even the Mail's Stephen Glover found that an outrage 'beyond defence'). Nor was it quantities of blue blood flowing through Parliament Square. </p> <p>No: the joy came from tables turned, from stereotypes wondrously reversed, from Telegraph readers cast as screaming yobs while the Sun mob surveyed the non-bunfight with studied propriety - 'For Fox Sake!' Oh my miners' strike of long, long ago. The Guardian could tut-tut now with impunity, the Independent safely lay into these 'hooligans in tweed' and the 'breathtaking hypocrisy' of those who gave them an indulgent ride. </p> <p>For what did the usual forces of law and order have to say? They ranted on day one - about the death of the countryside, the death of civilised values, the death of trust in the appalling Blair. 'Civil War', declared the Mail, modestly; pending 'national tragedy' predicted Charles Moore in the Telegraph . But then wiser counsels (or better tranquilisers) began to prevail. </p> <p>Sure, nobody could quite call Simon Heffer a counsel of wisdom. 'Totalitarian Britain', he squeaked. 'The United Kingdom is no longer a democracy'. But Paul Dacre's leader writers were growing more thoughtful. Naturally these country wallahs were a majority of 'largely decent people' who had been 'turned into outcasts and seen their way of life treated with contempt'. </p> <p>Nevertheless (with a screech of the brakes): 'That said, the Mail urges them to have a care. Wednesday was an ugly day for democracy. They mustn't allow frustration to boil over into illegality or violence.' </p> <p>Since that is exactly what they had done already, the ancestral 'that said' gambit (one beloved of editorial writers ever since one hand met the other) didn't carry total conviction. Neither did a Telegraph still proclaiming that country folk 'had been thrown to the dogs' by a Prime Minister forced to kow-tow to 'an atavistic left-wing' (who just happened to have been elected in overwhelming numbers). </p> <p>Any more weasels down the same fox hole? Yip, here came Tom Utley opining that 'Blair and his government have done far more damage to our most precious national institution that a handful of T-shirted demonstrators ever could'. Here, too, was Alice Thomson, declaring: 'the middle classes have had enough'. </p> <p>The what classes? Middle, middle, said Alice firmly. Those 'I met as I walked across St James's Park were working men and women who pay their taxes, send their children to local schools and queue up at local hospitals - firemen, farmers, dentists'. But Alice, love, have you opened your Mail ? 'Five of the eight ... have strong links with the Royal Family.' Luke is a chum of Harry and Wills, and his mater and pater hunt with Charles and Camilla. Robert is a linchpin of polo 'Team Highgrove'. The chef worked for the Royal Yacht, not Jamie Oliver. The Mirror's first day headline pun - 'Toff With Their Heads' - looked strong on fact, if weak on wit. </p> <p>Are the royals good news when their surrogate chaps try hunting for Blair? Probably not. The snorting Sun, going gingerly on class acts because it had its own security scoop to fry, remembers too many Hooray Henrys boozing with Harry and braying with Wills: not Mr Murdoch's natural choice of companion, y'know. And even the Mail - disinterring the Duke of Edinburgh's extramarital wanderings only a few days ago - has problems staying faithful. </p> <p>Here comes the Independent counter-attack on an ungrateful 'rural life only made possible by townie generosity'. They bray, we pay. Here comes Polly Toynbee in the Guardian taking an axe to these 'last hurrahs from a lost world'. You might suppose that too much heat had extinguished light. </p> <p>Which holds probably true for both high politics and low calculation. The TV violence didn't play well for the protesters. The sheer number of people who live in the country and hunt wouldn't keep a Fleet Street circulation manager warm through winter. The toff end of the press (with or without M'lord Conrad Black) isn't much good at 'speaking for Britain'. </p> <p>But excessive rage is counter-productive. Ms Toynbee, after all, went on to savage Labour as well. A Guardian leader worried about British opinion 'slow to anger but unafraid to strike'. The Mirror asked Blair to realise that once again 'he has got into a terrible mess'. </p> <p>Is it only 'them and us', then? Our readers right, their readers wrong? All those secretaries on the Atkins diet and retired sales directors in Guildford - the real gentry the Mail and Telegraph are landed with - wanting to take to the polo barricades, surrogate defenders of a life they can only imagine? If they'd only stop shouting for a second, they might be pleasantly surprised. That said, that is.</p>"
