  "The spotlight of blame for the Commons invasion today fell on Westminster as the Metropolitan police confirmed they believed yesterday's security breach was an \"inside job\". <p>Eight men are still being questioned over the storming of the Commons chamber during the yesterday afternoon's hunting debate, but today Met commissioner Sir John Stevens confirmed that a letter purportedly from MPs giving clearance for the intruders had been forged.</p> <p>He said: \"We have some reasons to believe there was an inside job in terms of how they got into the Palace of Westminster and how they got on to the floor of the Commons itself.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile the leader of the Commons, Peter Hain, today specifically urged that the \"antiquated\" serjeant at arms be replaced with a new director of security.</p> <p>Mr Hain was prevented by the Speaker from discussing security at this morning's Commons session - the last before the party conference season - but issued a statement later warning that we now lived in the \"age of the suicide bomber\".</p> <p>He said: \"The blunt truth is that the House of Commons is operating as if in a bygone age. This is the age of the suicide terrorist and our security arrangements are antiquated. </p> <p>\"The house must now act urgently together with the House of Lords and appoint a director of security with operational authority working directly to the security services and the Metropolitan Police - albeit ultimately accountable both to the Speaker and to the Lords' chairman of committees.\" </p> <p>Sir John also said a rethink might be needed on how authority and control at Westminster were organised. </p> <p>Later it emerged that police had earlier been alerted three times before the invasion to the presence of a known hunt supporter, wearing a hard hat, inside a security cordon thrown around Westminster. </p> <p>Liberal Democrat MP Paul Keetch disclosed on the ITV News Channel that one of his constituents had ended up dialling 999 after trying to tell police about the hunt supporter heading to join the Commons intruders disguised as contractors. </p> <p>The BBC later said one of its journalists had been tipped off about the protest. </p> <p>In a statement the BBC said: \"A BBC journalist was contacted by someone they had never met before. The information they received was passed into our news-gathering operation. </p> <p>\"The decision not to act on it further was taken at an operational level and in any respect no violence was threatened. Indeed the source made it clear no violence would be used. It was not clear to those handling the information that the demonstration would in fact definitely take place.\"</p> <p>Under the present system the serjeant at arms is in overall control within the Palace of Westminster, with contracted Metropolitan Police officers working under his direction. </p> <p>\"Yesterday's incident causes me to reflect on whether this is the best way for security arrangements to continue in the future,\" Sir John said. </p> <p>\"For instance, the contract states that police officers cannot go into the chamber without express permission and direction of the serjeant at arms. Perhaps this is something we need to revisit.\" </p> <p>The commissioner said all eight protesters were dressed in suits and some had worn tabards, clipboards and hard hats, but he denied that officers policing Parliament Square had overreacted and attacked demonstrators. </p> <p>This morning the Speaker, Michael Martin, told politicians from both sides - including the leader of the Commons, Peter Hain, who had been expected to brief MPs on the government's response to the pro-hunting invasion of the chamber - that submissions should be made to him in private. </p> <p>A security review of parliament's anti-terrorism defences, led by MI5, is already underway, following anti-war protests in the public gallery and the purple flour attack on the prime minister by the Fathers4Justice campaign. </p> <p>The only visible sign today of yesterday's drama was the presence of extra armed police officers patrolling Westminster. </p> <p>This morning the shadow home secretary, David Davis, called for the five men who invaded the Commons chamber to face criminal charges, and called the breach a \"spectacular failure\" of security. </p> <p>It was also announced today that the new Independent Police Complaints Commission is to carry out an investigation into allegations of police misconduct following yesterday's demonstration in Parliament Square. </p> <p>TV cameras on the scene showed footage of a line of police officers beating protesters repeatedly with truncheons, with no more visible provocation than a push or surge in the crowd, plus ocassional missiles being thrown.</p> <p>Several demonstrators complained to journalists that they had been beaten for no reason. This morning two of the 15 demonstrators from the clashes in Parliament Square were released without charge. </p> <p>Tony Blair's official spokesman said the prime minister recognised there were strong emotions on all sides of the debate. \"He also recognised there was a legitimate right to peaceful protest, but the emphasis must be on peaceful protest,\" the spokesman said. </p> <p>Police in south London are still questioning 13 people - including six for violent disorder, two for breach of the peace, two for affray, one for being drunk and disorderly, one for threatening behaviour and another for disorderly conduct. </p> <p>Eight men - including Otis Ferry, the son of rock star Bryan Ferry - were being quizzed by police about the dramatic protest inside the Commons, and an internal investigation is underway to identify a parliamentary pass-holder who is believed to have guided the men towards the Commons chamber. </p> <p><b>Parliament Act</b></p> <p>MPs leave parliament today for the party conference season, returning on October 11. The controversial hunting bill itself went to the House of Lords today, where, as is traditional, it was given an unopposed first reading. Peers will debate the bill's second reading on Tuesday October 12. </p> <p>In effect, peers have two options: they can reject the ban outright, in which case it will be forced through by the Commons and come into effect without any delay; or they can accept it, along with an 18-month delay before its implementation. </p> <p>There is a clear majority in favour of keeping hunting in the upper house, but the government has left no doubt that any attempt to derail the bill will be quashed by the invocation of the Parliament Act. </p> <p>The act allows the Commons to overrule the Lords if it rejects a piece of legislation approved by MPs in two successive sessions.</p>",
  "<p>More than 30 social security offices and jobcentres across Britain are to close under controversial plans to cut 100,000 civil servant jobs, workers were told today. </p> <p>A series of meetings were held with staff affected by the announcement which was attacked by union officials. </p> <p>The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) said 37 social security offices and jobcentres in some of the poorest communities in Britain would close from next year hitting the long-term unemployed, pensioners and other benefit claimants. </p> <p>More than 2,000 workers face losing their jobs under today's announcement, said the union.</p> <p>The PCS said it was more important than ever that civil servants voted to support a one-day strike on November 5 in protest.</p> <p>The job losses are part of the government's wider decision to cull 104,500 civil service jobs as part of the Treasury's efficiency review.</p> <p> A packed fringe meeting held earlier this week at the TUC congress in Brighton saw 12 general secretaries line up to pledge their support to the PCS over the cutting of civil service posts, backed by a TUC motion overwhelmingly carried the next day.</p> <p>Speaking from the TUC conference over the latest announcement on job losses, PCS's general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said some of the closures in areas including Carmarthen, Aberystwyth, and Wrexham in Wales would have a \"devastating\" impact on the local communities. </p> <p>\"The government said that their so-called efficiency drive was about putting more resources to the frontline, yet today we see essential services axed with no real thought of the impact on the communities they serve,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Services helping some of the most vulnerable in society are being slashed and offices helping people into work at the heart of some of the poorest communities are being closed.\" </p> <p>Mr Serwotka said he believed today's announcement was the first step towards the \"decimation\" of services provided by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). \"Workers will be angry, worried and extremely concerned about their future,\" he added.</p> <p>The union will be seeking an urgent meeting with the new work and pensions secretary, Alan Johnson. </p> <p>Almost 300,000 civil servants will be balloted next month on whether to take industrial action. </p> <p>Mr Serwotka said the DWP was portraying today's announcement as modernising services and improving efficiency but he said the complete opposite was true. </p> <p>Other office closures include Braintree and Southend in Essex, Worksop in the east Midlands, Bishop Auckland in the north-east, Bury, Rochdale and Salford in the north-west, Perth and Hamilton in Scotland, Ashford, Chatham and Tunbridge Wells in Kent, Bath, Bristol, Cheltenham and several social security offices in the West Midlands including Dudley and West Bromwich.</p>",
  "<p>\"You can get away with anything,\" sings Michael Crawford's Count Fosco in The Woman in White. But, although musicals get away with murder, not even Andrew Lloyd Webber's best score in years and Trevor Nunn's visually vibrant production can disguise the fact that this show is saddled with an impossible book. </p> <p>Not, I hasten to add, the 1860 Wilkie Collins novel on which it is based even though the adaptor, Charlotte Jones, has called it a \"flawed classic\". In fact Collins' novel is a masterly piece of Victorian suspense that tells a gripping story about a young drawing-master hired to tutor a beautiful heiress, Laura Fairlie, and her plain half-sister Marian Halcombe. En route to their Cumbrian home he encounters a distraught fugitive from an asylum who bears an uncanny resemblance to Laura. What follows is an intriguing story of wrongful incarceration, concealed identity and male rapacity. </p> <p>You can't expect a musical to reproduce the novel's innovative narrative technique in which the story is told from multiple perspectives. But what you can expect is a musical to respect its source. Here, however, Jones in trying to give Collins' novel a feminist twist actually lapses into romantic cliche. In the book Marian, although painted in physically unattractive terms, is a bright, resourceful, intelligent figure: one who aids the hero, Walter, in his attempt to uncover the sinister plot against Laura. But, while foregrounding Marian, Jones turns her into Walter's thwarted lover constantly singing \"I close my eyes and I still see his face\". </p> <p>What this does is to patronise the Victorians. Collins was adult enough to contrast the active, courageous Marian with the delicate, shadowy Laura who has what John Sutherland called \"an interesting aura of sexual ambiguity\". But Jones goes further and writes in a highly improbable scene where Marian tries to seduce Count Fosco, the oleaginously plausible accomplice of Laura's money-seeking husband. It's not only against the tenor of the novel but retrogressively implies that women can only achieve their ends through sexual vamping. </p> <p>It's a pity Jones's book isn't better because the show has a lot going for it. Lloyd Webber has written a particularly good score. It starts with a moment of Britten-like eeriness when Walter encounters the woman in white at a misty railway cutting. It expands into lavishly orchestrated love songs. And it gives Crawford's waddling, heavy-jowled, animal-loving Count Fosco a genuine Rossiniesque showstopper in which he hymns his ability to get away with anything even as a white rat crawls around his collar. </p> <p>Nunn's production also deploys visually stylish designs by William Dudley that use kaleidoscopically shifting projections to convey the story's multiple settings. At times, as when the whole perspective rapidly shifts during Laura's ill-fated wedding to Sir Percival Glyde, the effect is reminiscent of early Cinerama. But Dudley's transitions from baronial interiors to sunlit cornfields are impressive and open up new possibilities in the marriage of theatre and cinema. </p> <p>In addition, David Zippels' lyrics are deft and neat: \"until he went to Hades, he was catnip to the ladies\", Edward Petherbridge's hypochondriac Mr Fairlie sings of his late brother. And, although Crawford's Fosco steals every scene he is in, there are good performances all round. </p> <p>Maria Friedman as Marian, although forced into playing the role of the self-sacrificing, love-hungry spinster, renders the role with dignity and style. Jill Paice as Laura and Angela Christian as the mysterious woman in white, bring out the pair's physical similarities and circumstantial differences. And Martin Crewes is a forthright, heroic Walter even if Oliver Darley's Glyde is simply the stock villain from a romantic melodrama. </p> <p>But, while admiring the show's panache, I kept thinking how much better it could have been with a stronger libretto. </p> <p>I don't object to Jones excising minor characters or altering the story's structure: that inevitably happens when you turn a novel into a musical. What I find objectionable is that, in trying to give the story a modern spin and show all Victorian women as social victims, she actually deprives Marian of much of her odd, independent quirkiness that makes her one of the most original characters in fiction.</p>",
  "<p>Conrad Black has opened up a new front in his legal wars, filing a lawsuit against a Canadian magazine for a satirical article that envisaged the deposed press baron descending into hell.</p> <p>The former Daily Telegraph boss is seeking nearly \u00a31m in damages from Toronto Life magazine and the article's writer and illustrator, according to reports in the Canadian press.</p> <p>The four-page article, \"A Toast to Lord Black on His Arrival in Hell\", appeared in the July issue of the magazine. It was accompanied by an illustration showing the former media baron arriving in the underworld in the backseat of a convertible, giving a thumbs-up signal to a group of demons.</p> <p>In the piece, writer Robert Mason Lee compared Lord Black to newspaper mogul Charles Foster Kane from the famous film Citizen Kane, suggesting they both had a \"lust for prestige and influence, the unquenchable thirst for possessions, the acquisitive spouse, the immolating lack of proportion and self-control\".</p> <p>In his claim, Lord Black reportedly said the article and the illustration had brought him \"into hatred, ridicule and contempt\" and said the magazine \"has been vindictive, high-handed, contemptuous and demonstrated reckless and deliberate disregard for the damage that might be done to the good name of the plaintiff\".</p> <p>The lawsuit is a sideshow to the bitter legal action between Lord Black and Hollinger International, the Chicago-based company where he was chief executive until November and which sold the Telegraph in July.</p> <p>Hollinger has accused Lord Black and his associates of taking \u00a3220m out of the company over a seven-year period, and has named them in a \u00a3700m lawsuit that includes allegations of racketeering.</p> <p>Lord Black has always denied any wrongdoing and has sued a number of Hollinger directors for defamation, claiming they turned him into a \"loathsome laughing stock\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>"
