  "The Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman, Vincent Cable, today proposed \"substantial manpower change\" in the public sector to pay for the party's spending plans, refusing to rule out exceeding Gordon Brown's job cut plans. <p>Speaking to the media ahead of his conference address, Mr Cable said a future Lib Dem government would make savings of \u00a35bn in government spending but refused to explain how many jobs would be lost in the process, saying that he had not \"done a headcount exercise\".</p> <p>He conceded, however, that it was \"inevitable\" that some people might lose their jobs in some government departments.</p> <p>\"I don't pretend to you that the Liberal Democrats are into giving public service jobs for life and there would be painful consequences for some of these contractors,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We have not done a head count. But there would be change and there would be very substantial manpower change.\"</p> <p>Job cuts are most likely to be felt in the Department of Trade and Industry and Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, which Mr Cable plans to scrap altogether, and the culture and environment departments, where he plans significant cuts.</p> <p>In his conference address, Mr Cable warned delegates of the tough decisions ahead, and urged them to engage with the \"painful economic realities\".</p> <p>\"Budgets have to add up. Choices are needed in public spending. People want fairer taxes, not ever-rising taxes, and they want value for money.\" </p> <p>Mr Cable restated the \"traditional liberal message\" of Adam Smith: \"That markets must be allowed to work; trade should be free; [and] private enterprise should not be shackled by excessive regulation.\"</p> <p>And he ruled out tax rises other than the party's existing plan to raise the top rate of income tax to 50% for those earning over \u00a3100,000 a year.</p> <p>That tax rise is to be used to fund the Lib Dems' key \"social justice\" pledges; abolishing student tuition fees, introducing free personal care for the elderly, and minimising the cost of its new \"fairer\" local income tax.</p> <p>While the cuts in the DTI and other departments, plus the scrapping of the government's plans to introduce ID cards and \"baby bonds\", will pay for an increase in the state pension for the over-75s, the recruitment of 10,000 new police officers, and the introduction of free eye and dental checks.</p> <p>As the party's plans are based on the government's existing spending commitments - which include projected savings from the cull of 84,150 public sector jobs in England and 20,000 in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - it appears that Mr Cable would wield an even sharper knife than the current chancellor.</p> <p>Mr Cable is certainly aware that his proposals have to be watertight, with Labour and the Conservatives ready to pounce on any discrepancies or un-costed pre-election promises.</p> <p>In a sign of what is to come, the Tory leader, Michael Howard, yesterday accused the Lib Dems of making 100 new spending pledges funded by 40 new proposed taxes.</p> <p>Mr Cable insisted this morning, however, that his plans are \"pretty conservative\" in their estimates, while he warned colleagues this afternoon that they must retain \"economic discipline\".</p>",
  "<p>More young people believe they suffer from discrimination in the workplace than older employees, a survey has found. </p> <p>While 48% of employees over 45 felt people of their age were being sidelined in the world of work, 58% of those aged between 16 and 24 felt they had been unfairly treated because of their age or lack of experience. </p> <p>The research by the law firm Eversheds revealed that people believed the workplace was rife with age discrimination, which will be banned by legislation due to come into force in October 2006. </p> <p>One in three employees surveyed claimed to be victims of age discrimination. </p> <p>Rather than being a sign of young people's high expectations, said Audrey Williams, a specialist in discrimination legislation at Eversheds, the younger employees' complaints illustrated how senior managers tended to think of age discrimination in terms of older workers. </p> <p>\"It is not surprising that young people are feeling most victimised,\" she said. \"Our research showed that nearly half of senior managers think that age discrimination only affects old people.\" </p> <p>The survey also found that only a fifth of companies have a ban on using age as a factor in recruitment. </p> <p>Under the new anti-discrimination law, job adverts using phrases such as \"experienced\", \"graduate\" or \"mature\" could be regarded as discriminatory, breaching the legislation. </p> <p>\"Currently, business is not ready for this legislation and organisations will have a significant hill to climb to ensure that they don't fall foul of the law,\" Mrs Williams said. </p> <p>Workers in Wales and the south-east were shown to be the most common victims of age discrimination. </p> <p>Eversheds' research also showed that three-quarters of employees did not want a compulsory retirement age.</p>",
  "<p>It is immediately noticeable to British or American viewers of French television: there are no black faces. No newsreaders, no chatshow hosts, no gameshow guests; at most, a handful of actors in mainly stereotyped roles. </p> <p>So when Audrey Pulvar appeared this month as co-presenter of Soir 3, it caused something of a commotion: the 32-year-old journalist from the French Caribbean island of Martinique was the first black newsreader to present the main evening news on a national French TV station. </p> <p>\"French TV just does not reflect the reality of French society,\" Pulvar told the Guardian. \"There is a whole part of the French population that is not represented there. Or if it is, it's stigmatised in dreadful cliches - the black dealer, the Moroccan greengrocer.\" </p> <p>In a damning report earlier this year, the High Council on Integration demanded that the government make it a condition of every broadcaster's licence that immigrants be \"fairly and properly represented\". </p> <p>Days later, the state broadcaster France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions, which runs three of the country's six main TV channels, unveiled a plan to boost ethnic minorities' presence both on screen and behind the scenes. </p> <p>\"The French have to be able to recognise themselves,\" said the broadcaster's chief executive, Marc Tessier. \"Fifteen percent of our population are immigrants of non-European origin. Watching TV, no one would ever know it.\" </p> <p>Pulvar acknowledges that her appointment to the France 3 evening news came in the context of this long-overdue change. \"My colour was a necessary, but, I hope, not a sufficient condition,\" she said. \"But at the same time I felt I deserved this job: I've been 10 years in the profession, I've worked hard. I hope to be judged as a journalist, not as a black journalist.\" </p> <p>The pale face of French television is a reflection of the fact that few west or north African immigrants have moved far up the socio-economic ladder. Positive discrimination is considered \"inappropriate\" because it would amount to an admission that one of the core principles of the republic - that all citizens are equal - has not worked. </p> <p>Pulvar is against quotas but recognises some kind of affirmative action is badly needed in France. </p> <p>She said: \"There are huge prejudices. For years, there's been this fear that if black or Arab or Asian people are allowed on to the television, French audiences will just switch off.\" </p> <p>A fear that is, apparently, unfounded. Early viewing figures for her broadcast are higher than the equivalent show enjoyed last year. </p> <p>But racism most certainly exists in France, she says. \"It's maybe less visible, more diffuse, than in countries like Britain where the different communities all live and express their differences, sometimes violently. </p> <p>\"In France, the republic tries to level everyone out, to pretend they're all equal - so racism here is more latent. It doesn't explode, but it's there. When I go to London, I feel like I can breathe.\" </p> <p>Ulysse Gosset, who as editor of France 3's national news programmes was responsible for Pulvar's appointment, said his choice was first and foremost \"professional - she's an outstanding journalist and presenter\". But he admitted that he aimed to spark \"a small revolution\" in the world of French TV, \"which in terms of reflecting society is way, way off the game\". </p> <p>The daughter of a radical, separatist trade unionist, Pulvar insists she does not want \"to be a symbol of anything. My appointment may be a small step in a good direction, but it's not much. </p> <p>\"Every community must be represented in every part of French society, not just in the media but in advertising, in the civil service, and particularly in politics - why are there no black or Arab MPs? Immigrant candidates aren't even in eligible positions on electoral lists.\"</p>"
