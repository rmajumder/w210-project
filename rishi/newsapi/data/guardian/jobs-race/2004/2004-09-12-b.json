  "<p>Bulgaria is the new hotspot for prospective holiday home buyers who can't afford the inflated prices of Spain, France and Italy. </p> <p>The country has been included in the brochures of the main UK tour operators for several years, and its cheap beach and ski holidays have made it the third most popular destination after Spain and France for British holidaymakers. Property investors and those looking for a second home for themselves are following hot on their heels, buying a range of property from new beach and ski developments to dilapidated farmhouses. </p> <p>The attractions are obvious. The summers are long, hot and dry and the beaches on the Black Sea have glorious white sand. </p> <p>The Ski Club of Great Britain says Bulgarian ski resorts are good for beginners, intermediates and those looking for a budget option. Club spokeswoman Vanessa Fisher says: 'If skiing is one of the things you want to do on holiday, Bulgaria could be a good choice.' </p> <p>The country is set to become a member of the European Union in 2007, and property prices are expected to more than double. </p> <p>Ben Garner and Emma Hawkins already owned one property to let in the UK, but decided on Bulgaria for their next investment. The couple have bought a two-bedroom apartment in Elenite, just outside Sunny Beach - one of the biggest coastal resorts - without even having been to Bulgaria. </p> <p>Garner says: 'We decided to buy just out of Sunny Beach because we thought it would be a bit quieter. It's a new development - they've got to the stage of putting the electrics in.' </p> <p>Garner paid \u00a380,000 for the apartment, which he thinks may be a bit high, but he's confident prices will soon catch up. 'I was speaking to a property expert out there, and she says there has been a 40 per cent rise in Sunny Beach prices over the last year. She thinks it will carry on like that for the next few years. We expect to rent out the apartment for an average of \u00a3300 a week for the six- month season, and hopefully in four or five years time we'll have a nice capital gain too.' </p> <p>At the moment though, prices are still reasonable for anyone on a limited budget. Robert Jenkin of Bulgarian Dreams, a UK firm with offices in London, Sofia and Sunny Beach that acts as an estate, letting and management agent, says it's possible to find a one-bedroom apartment in Sunny Beach for \u00a330,000, while a rural idyll that needs works can go for as little as \u00a310,000. </p> <p>He recently sold a five-star spa development, Belle Vue, in the ski resort of Bankso - where the most expensive apartment went for \u00a370,000. 'The deal includes room service and the front door is just 100 metres from the ski lift,' he says. </p> <p>Legal and running costs also tend to be lower than those in the rest of Europe. The Bulgarian equivalent of the council tax costs about \u00a325 to \u00a330 per year. Bulgarian Dreams has negotiated a bulk conveyancing deal for customers buying into devel opments that costs just \u20ac250 per purchase, although the government levies a purchase tax of 2-3 per cent of the price. The process, based on the notary system, can be quick, taking an average of two weeks from start to finish, provided ownership of the property is straightforward. Jenkin says the firm has experienced no problems, but warns: 'If there is any corruption, it would be in the land ownership stemming from when the USSR [began to break up] 15 years ago. Ownership should be checked before you exchange contracts.' </p> <p>Simon Conn of Conti Financial Services, a firm that specialises in overseas mortgages, says that the emerging 'Eastern Eight' countries, which include Bulgaria, have gained a reputation for having legal systems that make it difficult for purchasers to establish legal title over their chosen properties. But Greek lender Piraeus Bank, which is willing to lend on Bulgarian properties, will ensure that it can establish whether a title has been registered, providing buyers with peace of mind that they actually own their home. </p> <p>The euro-based mortgage, available through both Conti and Bulgarian Dreams, has a minimum of \u20ac40,000 and a maximum term of 15 years. The current rate is 7.5 per cent. </p> <p>Conn says: 'It is not possible to get a mortgage on an apartment that has not been built. However, to ensure that your investment is safeguarded, it is possible to achieve a mortgage on completion when the title is registered in your name.' </p> <p>He says that non-Bulgarians are not permitted to own land in their own name, so those buyers considering purchasing the land to build a villa, for example, must do so through a Bulgarian company with the purchaser as legal owner of that company. It is then possible to achieve stage payments for building.</p> <p><strong>Affordable Bulgaria</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The summer season runs from 15 May to 15 October</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A two-bedroom apartment in Sunny Beach can be rented for \u00a360 per night in high season</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Bulgarian government levies a 15 per cent 'withholding' tax on any income or capital gains made on a property owned by a foreigner</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> As Bulgaria is subject to the double taxation treaty, this 15 per cent can be offset against the tax you would otherwise have to pay on bringing any income or gains into the United Kingdom</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> New properties have a 10-year guarantee</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bulgarians learn English at school, and many Bulgarian builders have worked in the UK.</p> <p><strong>Just the ticket</strong></p> <p>Robert Jenkin of <a href=\"http://www.bulgariandreams.com\">Bulgarian Dreams</a> (0207 614 1244) will be giving seminars on the Bulgarian property market at the Property Investor Show at the ExCel Centre in London at 2.30pm on 17 and 18 September.

  "<p>When pensions start to be mentioned on the fashion pages of newspapers, they have surely moved into the mainstream of public consciousness. In an article last week on the lifestyle pages of a daily newspaper, a well-known fashion writer listed worries about her pension as one of the reasons she was turning to budget clothing chains in an effort to economise; 'Why buy Prada when Primark will do?' was her message. </p> <p>This level of consciousness about pensions means that our latest Work and Pensions Minister, Alan Johnson, arrives in his post at what should be a pivotal time. He could assume a much higher profile in government than his several, mainly ineffectual, predecessors, although the experience could be uncomfortable for him. </p> <p>He certainly has plenty to deal with in his early months in the job, including the setting up of the compensation scheme for occupational schemes and appointing a new regulator for employers' schemes. But these are micro-management issues compared with the real job to be done on pensions which is to introduce root-and-branch reform. </p> <p>Johnson could be handed a golden opportunity to try to convince the government of the need for wholesale restructuring of Britain's pension system with publication in the autumn of an interim report from the Pensions Commission. This was set up by the government to consider pension provision and if the commission listens to the consensus on pensions it will recommend radical change. The consensus is for beefing up the basic state pension as the bedrock of a much simpler system. </p> <p>The problem for Johnson will be that this would require dismantling of the means-tested pension system so painstakingly constructed over seven years by the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, and his Treasury team. Some might say that the Treasury has hijacked pension policy with its means-tested credits and guarantees that are threatening to further cement people's deep scepticism about the value of pension saving. Why save if the amount you earn from those savings leaves you little or no better off than if you had spent the money? </p> <p>Then there is the aggravation of claiming means-tested pensions; government figures show that 40 per cent of eligible pensioners - 2 million - are not drawing their pension credits. </p> <p>But in any case voluntary saving is hard work in an era of low investment returns. Statistics from the market research company Datamonitor last week showed that the average worker's private pension fund is \u00a350,000 short of the amount needed to fund a comfortable retirement. </p> <p>One option is compulsory private saving, but this will be highly unpopular with voters if they think that it is a waste of money in a means-tested regime. </p> <p>So, the government is in a bind. Until recently it could dismiss pensions as a low-priority issue for most working people and of deep interest only to the retired. Ministers might do well to keep an eye on on the fashion pages in future.</p>",
  "First he survived a horrific crash and the media frenzy that followed. Now Trevor Rees-Jones, the bodyguard who nearly died with Princess Diana and Dodi al-Fayed when their car ploughed into a tunnel wall in Paris seven years ago, is facing what may be his toughest test of all: working as a security expert in Baghdad. <p>Rees-Jones, 35, arrived in the Iraqi capital earlier this year to work for a European telecoms company, which cannot be named for security reasons. His duties include protection of key personnel as they travel in the city and arranging security for their offices. </p> <p>The former British soldier is believed to be based in the 'international zone' in the centre of Baghdad, a high-security area where diplomats, the new Iraqi government and many private companies are based. The zone is heavily guarded by American soldiers but is still attacked with mortars almost every day. Residents call the morning strikes the 'dawn chorus'. </p> <p>Rees-Jones, who spent six years with the Parachute Regiment and served in Northern Ireland, is believed to carry a weapon much of the time. Almost all security contractors in Baghdad, and especially those involved with close protection of western specialists and officials, are armed. </p> <p>Rees-Jones has been seen at Baghdad airport, which is on the outskirts of the city and one of its most dangerous places. </p> <p>One of his jobs is to ensure the safety of technical experts travelling to and from the airport. The road to the airport, though heavily patrolled by US and Iraqi troops, is frequently ambushed and security companies usually rush their clients along it in a convoy of heavily armoured vehicles. All planes landing at the airport 'corkscrew' down to cut the threat from surface-to-air missiles. </p> <p>Last week, two Italian aid workers were kidnapped from their house in central Baghdad in a professional operation undertaken for money. More than 80 foreigners have been taken hostage in the country in recent months and many of them have been executed. </p> <p>There is some respite from the danger of living in Baghdad, however. Security men patronise bars in several hotels and in the international zone. Rees-Jones has a number of friends working for other organisations in the city. </p> <p>It is unclear how long Rees-Jones, who has recently set up a security firm in northwest England, will be in Iraq. Close protection work can be lucrative, with top operatives commanding fees of up to \u00a31,000 a day. But most earn a fraction of that. </p> <p>Contacted through an intermediary, Rees-Jones, who remarried two years ago and whose new wife was recently reported to be pregnant, refused to comment. A friend said: 'He is getting on with his life, doing something he does very well. He needs to earn a living like anyone else.' </p> <p>It will surprise many that Rees-Jones, who suffered terrible facial injuries in the crash, has to take on such dangerous work. It was widely thought that Mohamed al-Fayed, the owner of Harrods and Dodi's father, had provided a generous financial package for him. However, Rees-Jones fell out with his former employers after the tragedy. </p> <p>'After the accident, Mohamed al-Fayed looked after all of Trevor's medical needs,' a Harrods spokesman said. 'We broke all contact a couple of years ago with Trevor so do not feel we can comment on why he is doing this now.' </p> <p>Three years ago Rees-Jones published a book describing the events leading up to the death of Diana and Dodi. The pair died, along with their French chauffeur, trying to outrun paparazzi photographers after leaving the Ritz Hotel early on 31 August 1997. </p> <p>The chauffeur had been drinking. Rees-Jones has said he used the proceeds from the book to buy a \u00a3300,000 house in Oswestry, Shropshire, and to pay off legal bills. </p> <p>He was in a coma for 10 days following the crash and underwent months of reconstructive facial surgery. He has said he cannot remember the accident. </p> <p>He was kept in London for several months after his return from Paris while investigators tried to jog his memory for details of the events leading up to the crash. But nothing came back to him, except flashbacks and half-memories which he cannot be sure are real. At one point he said he remembered a voice 'calling out' Dodi's name in the armoured Mercedes moments before it spun out of control. Rees-Jones has been criticised for not insisting on a police escort for Diana and Dodi when they left the Ritz. However, in his autobiography he said he did everything he could to protect the princess. 'They died on my shift and I'll live with that for the rest of my life. But I look in the mirror every day and know I did the best I could,' he wrote. </p> <p>One source closely involved at the time of the crash said that Rees-Jones had been 'traumatised' by it. 'He may think [taking the job in Iraq] will absolve some of the guilt. But a big part of it will be money and to escape life in Oswestry. Trevor has been running ever since the accident happened.' </p> <p>Friends said such talk was 'rubbish'. 'He's not the sort of man to run away from anything,' one said.</p>",
  "Gordon Brown is still on course to become Prime Minister after the next election, friends of Tony Blair said last night, as frantic efforts were under way to patch up a potentially explosive rift between the two men. <p>Allies of the Prime Minister signalled that, despite public protestations that he wants to go on and on, Blair is privately expected to step down some time during the next Parliament, leaving the door ajar for his Chancellor. </p> <p>Last week's return of the arch-Blairite Alan Milburn - and the diminution of Brown's influence over the election campaign - once again brought the two camps dangerously close to all-out war, with claims that the Prime Minister had reneged on a pre-summer deal to quit. </p> <p>Sources close to the two men this weekend confirmed that Brown did have a chance of taking over the leadership before the summer recess. One insider described Brown as a 'decent individual' who at the last minute had been unable to plunge the knife into his old friend: 'He was always very ambiguous about it... he's a very emotional guy, Gordon, and that makes it more difficult [to do it].' </p> <p>The promotion of Milburn prompted widespread speculation that Blair now regards him, not Brown, as his favoured successor. But this weekend's mollifying message suggests that both sides have stepped back from the brink - even if only temporarily. </p> <p>'I would put money on Gordon being the next leader of the party,' said one senior party figure. 'It's not in Gordon's interests to have a poor election victory. He wants a large [majority] so that, when he becomes Prime Minister during the next term, he has got something to work with. If you look at the broader picture, Gordon must see he's still in the driving seat.' </p> <p>Another aide said while Blair has bounced back clearly invigorated from his summer break, he was still likely to serve only 'a substantial part of the third term' in Number 10 rather than a whole term. </p> <p>The attempt to pour oil on troubled waters suggests Downing Street is nervous of what Brown could reveal if provoked. </p> <p>With feelings still running high, angry Brownites yesterday warned that Milburn's life could yet be made impossible for him, with unions refusing to co-operate and even withholding money in protest at his views. </p> <p>'If the unions decide that they're not playing - and not paying - he might end up an emperor with no clothes,' said one. The warnings were reinforced by Ian Davidson, the Labour MP and former chair of the all-party trade union group, warning that unions needed reassurance that they would still get access under Milburn: 'There is a great danger that, if the trade unions and party members feel they are being excluded from the decision-making process, they will just sit on their hands, not campaign, not fund-raise and leave a relatively small number at the centre to run the entire election.' </p> <p>The Brown camp was most infuriated by suggestions that the reshuffle was calculated to humiliate him. The Chancellor himself is understood to have had a showdown with Blair last Thursday over the way the changes had been presented, after which both men agreed to halt the vitriolic rival briefings against each other by underlings. </p> <p>'The newspapers said the reshuffle was designed to send Gordon off the Richter scale. What way is that to run a government?' asked one friend of the Chancellor. </p> <p>Yesterday Downing Street hastily slapped down the former cabinet minister Stephen Byers for suggesting that Milburn would be an excellent Prime Minister. </p> <p>One senior source said there was 'no excuse' for stirring the pot, insisting that Byers was not put up to it by the Blair camp: 'There is no co-ordination as far as he's concerned. All the key people were very taken aback.' However, despite the emollient words, the return of Milburn clearly threatens Brown's prospects - despite his friends protesting that he has no hunger for the job. </p> <p>The tensions were underlined last night with the publication of extracts from a new book by Derek Scott, formerly Number 10's economics adviser, attacking an 'obstructive and deceitful' Chancellor. He claims Brown refused to tell the Prime Minister what was in his 1998 Budget and declined to discuss the five economic tests with Blair as it would be 'improper.' </p> <p>The row falls awkwardly, with Blair due to address the TUC tomorrow. Unions are seeking guarantees that the side-lining of Brown will not affect their influence over the manifesto. </p> <p>Kevin Curran, general secretary of the 630,000-strong GMB union, told The Observer that he was prepared for a public showdown right up to the eve of the election, if necessary. 'We are not going to allow the government just to roam further to the right without challenging them,' he said. 'This is a Labour government and a Labour government should not be pursuing Tory policies. I think they have been and that is why they are losing support in the country.' </p> <p>Tony Woodley, head of the 800,000-strong Transport and General Workers' Union, meanwhile called for 'clear blue water between ourselves and the Tories.' </p> <p>The Prime Minister is expected to warn of difficult decisions ahead over pensions, with Ministers preparing for the imminent report of a independent commission on retirement issues expected to recommend making pension saving compulsory.</p>"
