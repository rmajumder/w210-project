  "<p>Awareness of Scott-Heron's place in the development of black music has been given a boost by the recent Don Letts' documentary The Revolution Will Not Be Televised, so it's an opportune moment for BMG to reissue the Scott-Heron catalogue at mid-price. A fine opportunity to get acquainted with Scott-Heron's pioneering mix of politics, protest and proto-rap poetry, set to a musical jazz-funk hybrid. </p> <p>Unlike some of those he influenced, Scott-Heron had enough intellectual and musical flexibility to ensure that his medium wasn't crushed under the ponderous weight of his message. Perversely, it's to Scott-Heron's credit that not even RCA/BMG super-svengali Clive Davis was able to exploit him commercially, though the messages in his music remain indestructible.</p>",
  "<p>Five hundred hospital jobs are to go in two hospital trusts whose bids for foundation status were thwarted last month.</p> <p>Southampton University hospitals trust and Winchester and Eastleigh healthcare trust both applied to be in the autumn wave of foundation trusts, alongside 32 other trusts.</p> <p>But the two Hampshire trusts both withdrew from the running after realising they were set to lose the three-star rating criteria they needed to qualify as potential candidates.</p> <p>Winchester and Eastleigh healthcare trust lost two stars after failing to meet some key targets, while Southampton University hospitals, with a \u00a324m financial deficit, also dropped a star. </p> <p>Both trusts have pledged to raise their game, resolve their fiscal embarrassment and reapply for foundation status at the earliest opportunity.</p> <p>Southampton plans to reduce staff costs by \u00a310m this year, coupled with \u00a35m in non-staff cost savings.</p> <p>Winchester meanwhile plans to lose 100 jobs to help redeem its \u00a313m deficit. </p> <p>The decision by Southampton to cut 380 jobs was taken after the trust realised its financial recovery plan was \"not working fast enough\" - within three months of the new financial year, the trust was \u00a35.2 m in the red.</p> <p>Most of the job cuts are expected to be through voluntary redundancy, a reduction in agency staff and by leaving vacant posts empty. An equivalent of two wards will be closed to reduce agency staff costs.</p> <p>A spokesman for Southampton University hospitals NHS trust said that attempts to claw back the huge deficit was a top priority regardless of its foundation status aspirations. \"We still believe that going to foundation trust status will be the right thing in the future but even if we did not feel that we would still have to make these changes.\"</p> <p>The Winchester and Eastleigh healthcare's chief executive, Rod Halls, said the trust had yet to decide which jobs would go to meet its target of axing 100 full-time posts as part of its efficiency savings. Mr Hall has asked each departments to report on possible suggestions. </p> <p>\"We have 3,000 jobs with a turnover of 12% a year. There is scope to make some savings,\" he said. </p> <p>Local unions are concerned by the threat of job cuts. </p> <p>Southampton's Unison branch secretary, David Prout, said: \"At the time we were first notified around two months ago, as always, managers said it would not affect patient care. But of course it begs the question what are 380 people doing if they are not assisting with patient care? </p> <p>\"If it is mainly administrative staff - which are rumoured to be the posts that are not going to be filled - who is going to do the admin?\" </p> <p>He added: \"You can't lose 380 posts and it not make an impact both directly and indirectly, so we are very concerned about what is going on.\"</p>",
  "<p>Black people who want to volunteer for charities are being overlooked because voluntary organisations fail to reach out to black and ethnic minority communities, research published today reveals.</p> <p>Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, poet Benjamin Zephaniah and Baroness Amos, leader of the House of Lords, are among senior figures backing a new campaign to promote volunteering by black people and those from ethnic minorities.</p> <p>A survey of more than 500 black and ethnic minority Londoners, commissioned by volunteering agency TimeBank and the Ethnic Media Group, found that 62% of respondents thought their local area needed improving. </p> <p>The same number said that, if asked, they would be willing to volunteer their time to make these changes, but more than half did not know where to go or who to ask about voluntary work. </p> <p>Nearly three-quarters of those surveyed felt that mainstream charities would benefit from a more diverse volunteer base, which would help them better understand the needs of London's large black and ethnic minority communities. </p> <p>The survey has been published to mark the launch of a London-wide campaign, Mind the Gap, which aims to raise awareness among black and ethnic minority communities about how to volunteer, as well as the benefits of volunteering. </p> <p>The campaign aims to communicate the message that volunteering is one of the best ways to gain new skills and increase employability as well as helping the local community. It aims to connect people with volunteering opportunities across the capital. </p> <p>Tarela Diffa-Umeri, project manager for the Mind the Gap campaign, said: \"We know that people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds want to volunteer and feel strongly about putting something back into their community, but often don't know the best way to go about this. They are a hugely untapped resource.\"</p> <p>Mr Phillips said: \"The beneficial impact volunteers have on our society is immeasurable. But although around a quarter of London's population belong to ethnic minority communities, they make up only a fraction of the capital's volunteers. </p> <p>\"People in need, whatever their race, benefit from the time that others give, while the volunteering experience gives people the chance to develop new skills and mix with people from all backgrounds. It's time to address this imbalance.\"</p> <p>Mr Zephaniah said: \"London's ethnic groups are not represented enough in mainstream charities, despite the fact that black people volunteer and give time passionately to grassroots organisations. </p> <p>\"It would be great to see more information about volunteering with mainstream and local organisations made more accessible to black people, whatever their age, so that both the organisations and London's diverse population can take advantage of the many benefits to be gained from volunteering. It's all about us.\"</p>"
