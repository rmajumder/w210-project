  "<p>Sports chain JJB yesterday became the latest retailer to find itself the target of a takeover approach - prompting its shares to leap 23% and add \u00a3100m to the value of the business. </p> <p>The 450-strong chain, the UK's biggest sports retailer, confirmed yesterday afternoon that it had received an approach which may or may not lead to an offer for the company. The shares, which had been climbing for two days, closed up 45.5p at 241p, valuing the business at \u00a3555m. </p> <p>Last night the identity of the would-be bidder was still unclear. Analysts, who believe a successful bid would have to be pitched around 260p, suggested the most likely buyer was a venture capital group. </p> <p>However, some City insiders believe Mike Ashley, a retail and sports entrepreneur with a fortune estimated at around \u00a3500m, is behind the approach. Mr Ashley owns the 120-strong Sports Soccer chain and the Lillywhites store in London's Piccadilly Circus. He also owns the Donnay, Dunlop-Slazenger and Karrimor brands. </p> <p>Any bid from Mr Ashley would be bound to receive scrutiny from the competition authorities, as his existing business, combined with JJB, would have some 50% of the sports retail market - though only a very small share of the overall clothing market. Last night the businessman was unavailable for comment. </p> <p>Retail entrepreneur Tom Hunter - who owns Office shoes and greetings card retailer Birthdays and sold his Sports Division chain to JJB six years ago - was also tipped as a likely buyer. </p> <p>He has an 8% stake in JJB through his West Coast Capital investment vehicle, but is not thought to be involved in yesterday's approach. A spokesman for Mr Hunter refused to comment. </p> <p>JJB's chairman, Dave Whelan, a former professional footballer who has built the business up from a single store over 30 years, owns 25% of the firm and his agreement is therefore crucial to any would-be bidder. </p> <p>Last year he attempted to take the business private, offering 220p a share, but his plan was blocked by the non-executive directors. He has said that he will not try again.</p>",
  "<p>JJB Sports provided some excitement late yesterday as hardened market speculators piled into the stock on hearing the company, Britain's biggest sportswear retailer, had received a takeover approach. </p> <p>Ever since JJB issued a nasty profits warning at the end of August the view in the City has been that the company is vulnerable to an approach. It is a perfect candidate for a leveraged buyout given the fact it has no debt and is highly cash generative. </p> <p>Any deal requires the backing of David Whelan, JJB's chairman and 40% shareholder, and at the time of last month's warning he claimed to be 120% committed to the business. Traders noting yesterday's rise also reflected hopes and industry gossip that there has been an improvement in trading since the statement. </p> <p>The City will find out if there is anything in that particular rumour when JJB files half-year numbers on October 13. </p> <p>JJB closed 8.25p higher at 195.5p.</p>",
  "<p>Three factory plant closures and more than 1,300 job losses were announced to the City yesterday, highlighting continuing pressure on British business to cut labour costs and relocate overseas. </p> <p>Danish dairy group Arla, which makes Lurpak and Anchor butter, said more than 400 jobs would go in the first half of next year as it closes down a dairy in Ruislip, west London, and one in Newcastle. </p> <p>Closures were widely expected following the group's acquisition of Express Dairies last year. The announcement comes five months after Arla cut 310 jobs with the closure of a dairy in Lancashire and a bottling line in Essex. A new Arla dairy in Leeds has begun production. </p> <p>Cost savings from the acquisition of Express Dairies were \"ahead of schedule\", Arla said in a statement. Commenting on the closures, chief executive Neil Davidson said: \"The industry had spare capacity ... taking that out was one of the things that made the merger attractive.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, Europe's largest tourism group, TUI, confirmed plans to cut its UK workforce by 8%, with the loss of 800 jobs by the end of the year. The job losses are expected across the group's Lunn Poly travel agency, Thomson tour operator and Britannia airline divisions. </p> <p>TUI plans to rebrand its Britannia and Thomson fleet of aircraft as Thomsonfly and has promised to invest in extra planes and refurbishment. </p> <p>The group is struggling to keep pace with changes in holiday booking patterns, as customers are increasingly abandoning high street travel agencies in favour of the internet, television and telephone. </p> <p>Elsewhere, security group Chubb told investors it was transferring production at a south Wales fire extinguisher factory to China and would be cutting more than 150 jobs. The move will come as a blow to the workers at the plant in Ferndale, who wanted management to give its backing to an alternative proposal that would have seen the factory expanded. </p> <p>It will go some way to consolidating Chubb's international extinguisher products business and will allow the group to benefit from lower labour costs. </p> <p>Eric Patry, president of Chubb Continental Europe, said: \"Chubb's long history of production in Wales has made this a very difficult decision so we have taken the time to evaluate all our options. </p> <p>\"I believe transferring production to China is the best way for us to continue to provide our customers with a high quality product at a competitive price.\" </p> <p>Critics of the government's decision to increase the minimum wage, which comes into force today, are likely to seize on the round of job losses as evidence of pressures on the UK labour market. </p> <p>The minimum wage is to rise from \u00a34.50 an hour to \u00a34.85.</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of civil servants today started voting on strike proposals over government plans to axe more than 100,000 jobs.</p> <p>The Public and Commercial Services union is balloting 290,000 members across every government department to ask whether they want to take part in a one-day strike scheduled for November 5. </p> <p>The job cuts - announced by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, in the budget - will include 2,000 posts lost with the closure of 37 jobcentres and social security offices across the country.</p> <p>Civil servants are also angry at changes to their terms and conditions, sickness absence arrangements and the prospect of working five years longer if pension ages are raised from 60 to 65.</p> <p>The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: \"Members are angry to be faced with such damaging and arbitrary cuts, anger which will only be compounded if plans to raise the pension age get the green light. Cuts on this massive scale will damage services we all rely on from your tax credit to your car tax and from your child benefit to your pension credit. </p> <p>\"When all around are seeking to cut with little thought of the damaging impact it will have and as the axe begins to fall, we as a union are taking a stand. A stand in which we are confident the thousands of our hardworking members will make in voting for a one-day strike highlighting the work that they do touches people's everyday lives.\"</p> <p>The ballot will run until Friday October 22.</p>",
  "The government is to put out to tender all its dedicated juvenile jails that hold children under 18 in a departure in Whitehall's privatisation programme, the Guardian has learned. <p>The four institutions are to be offered as a job lot to be run by a private prison company in a deal thought to be worth \u00a350m as part of an attempt to boost competition and \"choice\" in the penal system. It is also thought to be designed to tempt US prison firms into the British market. </p> <p>The institutions are Huntercombe near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire; Warren Hill, in Woodbridge, Suffolk; Wetherby in West Yorkshire and Werrington in Stoke-on-Trent. Warren Hill has a special unit which holds teenage murderers and others given very long sentences. </p> <p>They hold 1,000 offenders including some of the most dangerous. They - with Ashfield near Bristol, which is privately run by Premier Prison Services - are the only dedicated prisons for the under 18s. Other publicly-run young offender institutions also hold teenagers but they are mixed with young adults up to the age of 21. </p> <p>The leak of the plan, which is being proposed by Martin Narey, the chief executive of the new National Offender Management Service, has caused alarm among reformers and prison unions. </p> <p>Frances Crook, of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: \"We have not seen any proof that private prison companies are any better at running child jails.\" </p> <p>Colin Moses, chairman of the Prison Officers' Association, said it would hold an emergency meeting today to consider boycotting the tender process. \"They should remain in the public sector, not for ideological reasons, but because those who are responsible for the most vulnerable in our society have a duty not to make a profit from their suffering.\" </p> <p>At Ashfield the situation became so bad two years ago that Mr Narey invoked his powers for the first time to replace a private prison director with a state prison governor. But the record of child jails run by the Prison Service is also poor, with 11 suicides of teenagers in the past five years. </p> <p>The scheme is being considered by Home Office ministers and if, as expected, it goes ahead next year, the four institutions will become the first public sector prisons in Britain to be handed over to the private sector. In the past the government proposed privatising Brixton but no company was interested enough to bid for a single failing inner city south London prison. </p> <p>The four all have relatively good records and some have undergone recent refurbishment. Earlier this year the merger of Group 4 and Securicor halved the number of private prison companies operating in Britain and Mr Narey has tried to persuade US companies to bid for British contracts. </p> <p>The two largest private prison operators in the US, the Geo Group and the Corrections Corporation of America, have been involved in running British prisons and immigration detention centres in the last 10 years but have both pulled out in the last few years. </p> <p>Mr Narey made clear he was going to offer \"clusters\" of prisons to increase interest and the four juvenile jails are to be the first \"themed cluster\" to be put out to tender. </p> <p>It is believed they have been chosen to pioneer this programme - known as \"contestability\" in the Whitehall jargon - because unlike many state prisons they already have defined contracts as part of their relationship with the Youth Justice Board, which \"buys\" places at each of the jails. </p> <p>Harry Fletcher of Napo, the probation union, said that \"contestability\" was another word for privatisation or market testing and was a \"cynical attempt to drive down costs\". </p> <p>It is believed that an attempt to put the work of the north-west probation area out to tender will follow next.</p>",
