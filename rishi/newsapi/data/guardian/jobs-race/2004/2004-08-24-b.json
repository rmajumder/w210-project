  "<p>Man Group, the London firm that has built itself into the world's largest publicly-quoted hedge fund manager, yesterday launched its latest investment fund, Man RMF Multi-Style Series 2, and made its usual boast about the returns investors can expect: \"Series 2 targets an annual return of 13%-15%,\" says the blurb. </p> <p>If it happens, it would be impressive. Such is the power of compound returns that an investor would treble his money in nine years at 14% a year. In an era of low interest rates and low inflation, that would translate to a chunky improvement in an individual's purchasing power. But is it really possible? For the first time during Man's 10-year transition from dull commodity broker to giant of the sexiest area of fund management, doubts have arrived. The issue is simple: many of its funds have achieved strong double-digit performances in the past, but they are not doing so now. </p> <p>Man's website details the performance of 93 funds, mostly related to the core AHL Diversified fund, that are open to wealthy private investors: 91 have fallen in the year to date. The two risers are up just 1.3% and 0.6 %; among the fallers, some 27 are down by 10% or more, including a currency fund that lost 25.8% of its capital between January and July. </p> <p>Man argues it is nothing to worry about. Temporary setbacks, it maintains, are to be expected because of the nature of AHL, a trading program that the company likes to describe as a computer-driven \"black box\". </p> <p>That makes it sound mysterious, but AHL's method is straightforward in practice. The computer aims to identify price trends in a range of markets - shares, bonds, commodities, currencies and so on - and follow them. Human interference is virtually banned: the computer runs around the clock, spilling out \"buy\" and \"sell\" orders that Man's traders merely implement. </p> <p>Man argues that the weakness in AHL's performance - it is down 11.8% this year, including a slide of 10% since March - is explained by the lack of clear trends. Equity markets have been becalmed while the direction in US interest rates has reversed. It's just a question of waiting for new trends to develop, the group says, and look at the longer picture - average returns of 17.9% a year since 1990. </p> <p>\"We do not believe that AHL's best days are behind it,\" says Man. \"It is always possible with a strategy such as AHL's that displays a high degree of volatility to find periods of underperformance, but these are no more representative of the product's long-term performance than a period of sustained out-performance would be.\" </p> <p>Outsiders, though, wonder whether the recent performance spells something more sinister. \"Man's problem is that it is now too big for its own good,\" says one hedge fund analyst. \"All investment experience suggests it is very hard to be both the biggest and the best.\" </p> <p>There is little doubt AHL is big. It accounts for $10.3bn of Man's $38.5bn (\u00a321.4bn) under management, a huge sum of money to be dedicated to a single style of investment. Critics say the sheer size means it is no longer sufficiently nimble to exploit the most attractive opportunities. </p> <p>They say AHL now has to bet in such size that its mere presence as a buyer or seller moves the price of the asset it is trying to secure. In the trading jargon, this is known as slippage - the difference between the price at which the computer says \"buy\" and the actual price at which the asset is bought. </p> <p>It is an idea that Man refutes. It claims to have refined a trading system that has kept slippage at the same level as when AHL was merely a $1bn fund. At the same time, however, it admits that the fund's exposure to some agricultural-related markets, which tend to be less liquid and therefore more likely to generate slippage, has fallen over the years. It is now more reliant on pure financial instruments, such as currencies, government bonds and interest rates. </p> <p>Man's past success has, naturally, bred competition. Indeed, four of AHL's creators - including two who lent their names to its initials, Michael Adam and Martin Lueck - left in 1997 to build their black box and run their firm, Aspect Capital. Ironically, Man owns 25% of Aspect, a stake inherited with its takeover of RMF. </p> <p>But momentum-following black boxes are everywhere these days. Computer-driven program trading is the biggest innovation in investment management over the past 30 years. If AHL is affected by size, the number of copycat momentum funds could exaggerate the effect. Or, as Richard Russell, the American investment theorist, put it: \"When everyone is thinking the same, no one is thinking.\" </p> <p>Man rejects the notion. \"We do not believe that competition will necessarily dampen returns,\" it says. \"We believe in fact that there is an argument that greater competition will create increased interest in, and awareness of, the benefits of hedge funds as part of a diversified portfolio.\" </p> <p>Contrast that with Warren Buffett's view of size in fund management. The greatest investor of the second half of the 20th century offered this observation in last year's letter to his Berkshire Hathaway investors: \"Investment managers often profit far more from piling up assets than from handling those assets well. So when one tells you that increased funds won't hurt his investment performance, step back: his nose is about to grow.\" </p> <p>In Man's case, handling vast sums is very profitable. In common with other hedge funds, it has rewritten the rules of how investment managers are rewarded. A private investor in most Man hedge funds has to pay a management fee of 3% a year plus a further 1% fee that allows him to redeem his investment on a monthly basis. </p> <p>When the fund makes a positive return, Man keeps 20% of the proceeds as its performance fee, albeit only when the fund has passed its previous high point. A traditional fund manager, investing only in shares, would be happy to accept just 1% of funds under management in total. </p> <p>Performance fees by nature are hard to predict, but AHL's slowdown means that City analysts are pencilling in a fall from \u00a3139m to about \u00a377m for the year to March 2005. Regular management fees, boosted by fund launches such as yesterday's, will have to grow 20% just to keep overall profits static at about \u00a3500m. </p> <p>The unknown is how long that will continue if the investment performance remains soggy - and when you are promising 15% a year there is plenty of room for disappointment. Few investors have managed it for more than a decade. </p> <p>For now, the City's analysts are supportive. \"When AHL has had 10% or so drawdowns in the past it has bounced back quite quickly from them,\" says Jason Streets of UBS. \"This fund tends to bounce back with a vengeance - the sails fill with wind and it speeds up. History would suggest the next likely move will be upwards.\" </p> <p>He thinks the moment when Man's investors should worry about AHL performance \"quite a long way away\" but admits that questions would have to be asked if it went sideways over the next year. </p> <p>Worryingly for the company, its shares have developed a nasty habit of reacting directly to the AHL's weekly performance figure, which is announced after the stock market has closed on a Tuesday. One day last month, Man's share price fell 7% as a 4% fall at AHL was announced. </p> <p>Other hedge funds have also been heavy sellers of Man shares. \"People talk about hedge funds shorting Man as if it is all a bit of joke,\" says one fund-of-hedge funds manager. \"What they should be focused on is the fact that the people who know the industry best are making a bet that Man is really a one-product company that is out of its depth.\" </p> <p> <strong>From coffee beans to Big Mac status</strong></p> <p> Whatever happens next to Man, the directors who have led its transformation from dull commodities broker to dominant force in the sexiest area of fund management are made men. Five directors and former directors of Man are calculated to have personal fortunes that add up to about \u00a3350m. </p> <p>The largest part of the sum comprises shares in the business, but Man is a company that pays top dollar. </p> <p>Chief executive Stanley Fink earned \u00a34.5m in salary and bonus last year, against \u00a33.8m in the previous year. His stake in Man, even after the share price fall of the past few months, is worth \u00a363m. Among personal investments is a hotel in the plush Alpine ski resort of Courchevel. </p> <p>Chairman Harvey McGrath is even richer - his shares are worth \u00a386m. </p> <p>Man's involvement in hedge funds came almost by accident. ED&amp;F Man was a trader in commodities such as cocoa, sugar and coffee, and found itself increasingly using the futures markets to hedge price risk. On the back of that expertise it launched a futures brokerage business in the 80s. </p> <p>By 1984 it was confident enough to enter a partnership with a trader and statistician to test an investment system of following price trends in markets. In 1989, it went further into the same field by buying the little-known investment management firm Adam, Harding &amp; Lueck, now rebranded as AHL and Man's core asset. In recent years it had added expertise in allocating cash to external hedge funds through acquisitions such as fund-ofhedge funds manager Glenwood. </p> <p>The purchase of AHL coincided with the start of the boom in hedge funds as institutional investors grew bored with traditional managers trying, and often failing, to beat stock market indices. </p> <p>Aside from the investment performance of AHL, its innovation has been to take hedge funds to individual investors, albeit wealthy ones. The core AHL fund requires a minimum investment of $1m. The average investment in other AHL-related funds is $200,000 and minimums are set at about $50,000. Regular punters need not apply. </p> <p>The investors have tended to come from the far east and Middle East, and Man's sales technique has prompted rivals to dub it \"the McDonald's of the hedge fund world\" - a reference to its reliance on a network of 1,700 intermediaries, mainly financial advisers, to find a steady stream of new investors.</p>"
