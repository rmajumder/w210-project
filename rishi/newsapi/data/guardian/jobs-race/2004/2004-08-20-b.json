  "<p><strong> The Snow </strong><br> by Adam Roberts<br> 297pp, Gollancz, \u00a310.99</p> <p> This novel is the fifth in as many years from Adam Roberts, a young(ish) and prolific British writer. The Snow starts promisingly. In a narrative that is refreshingly direct, if free of distractions such as characters, dialogue, dramatic irony and so on, the opening pages take us at a gallop through a Wyndhamesque disaster scenario. \"The snow started falling on September 6th,\" are the first words, and the story is under way. </p> <p>We are in London, and as the insistent snow smothers the capital, the slide from normality to global disaster is sketched plausibly if synoptically: blizzards and snowploughs, side streets clogging up, people being stranded, difficulties obtaining food... but telephones and TV are still working, so life goes on. </p> <p>Gradually, though, life ceases to go on. The snowploughs grind to a halt, the drifts reach rooftop level, the phones and televisions stop working. It becomes quiet out there, with most people frozen to death and the handful of survivors staggering around using tea-trays and tennis racquets as makeshift snowshoes. Our central character, a young Asian woman named Tira, puts on her ski-jacket and snow-trousers and heads off across the roofs into Clapham, looking for other survivors. </p> <p>So far so good, but the problem with all disaster stories is that the story depends on events that have nothing to do with character development. To keep the reader involved, the author is really only left with two directions. </p> <p>The first is to go the John Wyndham route, in which survival and the re-establishment of civilised values are the main motives in a realistic-seeming set of circumstances. A recent example of this is Roland Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow , which, for all its special effects and hints of a global catastrophe, really boils down to the story of a handful of people waiting to be rescued from a library. The other route is to use the scenario as a metaphor for something else. All the time I was reading The Snow I kept remembering Anna Kavan's 1967 novel Ice: a deep and long-lasting winter has brought social chaos, and the military intervenes to maintain order. It soon becomes clear that Kavan's book is an extended allegory about her heroin addiction.</p> <p>Roberts arrives at this choice of routes when Tira is rescued by a group of Americans who have set up a military society above the snow. This now lies three miles deep across the whole world, but Tira has managed to survive for a year underneath it. Sensing a change of direction, we wonder which way the story will go from here: Wyndham or Kavan?</p> <p>The answer is neither. Roberts closes off the realistic-seeming route by the sheer unlikeliness of his own claims. Snow three miles deep everywhere? Everywhere? That's an awful lot of snow, never mind where it came from. While Tira has been getting by on tinned food in a hole under the snow (how did she breathe?), the enterprising Americans have restored order three miles above, setting up bases and imposing the rule of law. Why neither the bases nor the rule of law sink is another evasion, but the Americans seem to have escaped from the snowy deeps with their weapons, hovercrafts, helicopters and building materials all intact. </p> <p>The author's offhand manner extends to his attempts to explain the snowfall. We first hear about a pseudoscientific electron sheath which \"crosses global lines of magnetic force\", and later there are suggestions that extraterrestrials are behind it all. You sense an authorial yawn is being barely suppressed: Roberts neither knows nor cares about the cause, so why should the reader? </p> <p>Nor is there any apparent allegorical content, other than some heavy-handed satire on repressive regimes. Tira finds herself in a society in which all documents and records are controlled. Her own story now turns out to be censored, but it's never clear why. </p> <p>From this point in the novel all the other characters are called \"[Blank]\" and their dialogue has been edited in the same way as the Watergate transcripts edited the cussing in the Oval Office. It hardly matters: much of the latter part of the novel consists of long passages of heavily padded rhetoric about side issues. </p> <p>This book shows every sign of being a hasty first draft; it does its author no credit at all and is a significant disappointment.</p>",
  "<p>The Sun's associate editor (news), Paul Field, has resigned after just a year in the job to take up a new job at the National Enquirer publisher, American Media, in New York.</p> <p>Field, who handed in his notice today to Sun editor Rebekah Wade, will be vice-president of American Media, publisher of a slew of celebrity titles in the US including the Enquirer and the Globe.</p> <p>His remit will be to oversee the planned expansion of the group, which at one point held negotiations with Richard Desmond to launch a US version of OK! magazine.</p> <p>Sources close to Field said his departure had been \"entirely amicable\" and that he is currently discussing a departure date with Rebekah Wade. </p> <p>But he has proved a controversial figure since joining the paper 13 months ago from the Mail on Sunday, where he had the same role.</p> <p>When Sue Thompson quit as news editor of the Sun in May after 14 years on the paper, her departure was widely considered to have been prompted by her strained relations with Field.</p> <p>Thompson had earlier walked out following a stand-up row with Field, telling Wade she did not want to see him there on her return.</p> <p>The argument was resolved with Field being told to stick to his \"big picture\" remit, with Thompson maintaining her day-to-day editing role. But just a few months later Thompson quit.</p> <p>Sources at the newspaper said Field had lost the respect of some senior journalists on the paper, including the influential political editor Trevor Kavanagh.</p> <p>\"The atmosphere in the office today is pretty ecstatic,\" said one. They were popping champagne corks on the features desk after hearing the news, and Rebekah [Wade] has let it be known how pleased she is.\"</p> <p>Field will report to the chairman and chief executive of American Media, David Pecker, and is expected to oversee an overhaul of the group's existing titles as well as spearheading new launches.</p> <p>Field said in a statement: \"I am very proud to have worked at the Sun and, thanks to Rebekah and the best team of news editors and reporters in the business, I have had a fantastic time over the past 13 months.</p> <p>\"But the opportunity I have been offered in the United States by American Media is too big and too challenging to turn down.</p> <p>\"I am immensely excited about taking up my new position in New York.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>British sprint hope Darren Campbell is hoping to recover in time from a slight hamstring injury which could put him out of the 100m heats tomorrow.</p> <p>On the first proper day of track and field competition in Athens, the Olympics 200m silver medallist in Sydney four years ago told reporters he was still unsure whether he would be able to compete in the shorter event.</p> <p>Campbell is also set to line up in the 200m later in the competition, an event in which is traditionally considered his stronger event, particularly with the Greek reigning champion Kostas Kenderis having been ruled out following a drugs scandal last week. </p> <p>Campbell, 30, said he woke up yesterday suffering with what he thought was cramp, but after having a scan the results showed a slight muscle tear. </p> <p>\"I'm told it should be okay,\" said Campbell, who has suffered with hamstring problems since the Sydney Olympics. \"I'll know more over the coming hours but I'll be saying a few prayers tonight.\"</p> <p>Campbell would only have been in with an outside chance of a medal in the 100m as his times at the distance are below those of the world's best. However, he is known as a strong big race competitor following his Sydney triumph, and has already been identified by defending champion Maurice Greene as a potential threat. </p> <p>Jamaican-born American Asafa Powell and countryman Shawn Crawford will be major threats, with Powell having beaten Greene twice in pre-Athens warm-ups and Crawford having run a blistering 9.88 this year.</p>"
