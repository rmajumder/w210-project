  "<p>If you manage to obtain an A-grade or equivalent in your Tefl course, it occasionally happens that your course provider will offer you work. Other than this, Tefl schools tend to be in a strong position when it comes to taking on teachers - especially inexperienced ones. This means you have to approach finding work in a structured way, although it is said that it is much harder to get through an intensive course than it is to find work afterwards.</p> <p>With so many schools abroad listed on the internet, in books and even on specialist CDs these days, recruiters do receive a considerable number of applications by email. So it is good to think of other ways to stand out and make yourself known to a future employer. Every contact with a school should reflect your abilities to do a good job in the classroom. If you have to send an email, then do something different - send photos of you teaching and an interestingly presented CV. A couple of original lesson plans might demonstrate your strengths as an EFL teacher, as well.</p> <p>Trawling the country's yellow pages online can generate your own contacts. Phoning the school might be a good way of finding out about possible openings, while, at the same time, building up a rapport with staff. If you're in the region, calling in to get your face known is by far the best idea. Schools particularly appreciate it when teachers are already settled into accommodation and are ready and able to start work at the drop of a hat.</p> <p>Getting initial job offers will likely be a combination of right place, right time, luck and your good presentation skills. While you may wish to accept the first position that comes along, it is important to be sure you know something about the school - especially if you've not been able to visit the place personally. Best of all is talking to teachers who work, or who have worked, there and know the ropes. A good school should be happy to let you talk to staff.</p>",
