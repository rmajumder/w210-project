  "The number of unemployed people in Britain has hit its lowest level in 20 years, figures showed today. <p>Data released by the Office for National Statistics revealed that unemployment numbers have fallen by 51,000 to 1.39 million.</p> <p>Using the internationally recognised ILO measure, the ONS said the unemployment rate had fallen to 4.7% in the three months to August, the lowest level since 1984. Almost 74.7% of the UK population is in employment.</p> <p>\"There are over 200,000 more people in work than this time last year,\" the minister for work, Jane Kennedy, said. \"With the success of the economy and growing employment, more people have moved from welfare into work. Our aim now is to build on this success by extending employment opportunity to all.\"</p> <p>\"Jobcentre Plus, together with programmes like the New Deal, have contributed to historically low levels of unemployment and are increasingly making a difference for other people on benefits.\" </p> <p>Statistics also showed that the number of people claiming unemployment benefits had fallen by 200 to 834,000in September to 834,000.</p> <p>Despite being the lowest level since 1975, the figure fell far short of a predicted drop of 5,000. Following 16 consecutive monthly falls, the ONS also reported that drops in the claimant count appeared to be slowing. </p> <p>Regional figures showed the highest unemployment rate between June and August was in London, with 6.9% unemployed, while the lowest was in the south-west, at 3.4 %. The manufacturing sector has been hardest hit by job losses, particularly in the textiles and clothing industries.</p> <p>The ONS also said the number of inactive people of working age had risen by 91,000 to 7.93 million on the quarter, the highest figure since this series began in 1984. </p> <p>Meanwhile, average earnings, excluding bonuses, rose more than expected in the three months to August. They went up from 4.2% to 4.3%, with the rise attributed to pay increases in private sector education and for some local government employees.</p> <p>Ross Walker, a UK Economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland said that although the figures indicated wage inflation, he doubted that the Bank of England would raise interest rates this year.</p> <p>\"There is nothing in the figures to change the interest rate outlook this year, but I think, in terms of the early part of 2005, this issue of wage inflation could be a factor that could squeeze a quarter point hike,\" he added.</p>",
  "<p>When David Collier uproots from Nottinghamshire and puts his feet under the desk of the England and Wales Cricket Board chief executive at Lord's he will be taking on an organisation in relatively robust health financially, with an Australian bonanza to come next summer, but one where morale must be at a low ebb. </p> <p>The past season has seen top men abandoning the ship: first the commercial director, Mark Sibley, for less rancorous pastures; next Des Wilson, the non-executive chairman of the board's marketing advisory committee, who resigned amid the increasing mayhem of the Zimbabwe affair; then the director of corporate affairs John Read; and finally the chief executive himself, Tim Lamb, who, in the wake of almost daily criticism over his handling of the Zimbabwe situation, signed off at the end of last month. </p> <p>In addition there were moves to restructure the administration of the English game, strong criticism of the way professional cricket is run and despairing calls from the grass roots. </p> <p>Who, in his right mind, would want to take over an organisation in such turmoil where the future structure is not apparent, key figures are not in place and core negotiations are being handled by selected county chairmen? </p> <p>The headhunters Norman Broadbent whittled the best part of 100 applicants down to 29 and then three: Collier, chief executive at Nottinghamshire, Richard Bevan, chief executive of the Professional Cricketers' Association, and Matthew Wheeler, briefly a first-class cricketer with Northamptonshire, whose expertise is sports marketing. </p> <p>Now Collier, with broad experience around the counties, and in other sport, has got the vote. He finalised terms with the board chairman David Morgan yesterday afternoon and, the decision having been ratified by other board management members, he is to be unveiled at Lord's this morning. </p> <p>It seems, on the face of it, to be a comfortable appointment rather than the contentious item it might have been had such a senior post been passed outside the game. </p> <p>The 48-year-old Collier, although already on the ECB management board, is of the counties and as such will appeal to them overall. They may even feel they will retain some control that might otherwise disappear. There is, however, an element in the shires, articulated by the ECB vice-chairman and former chairman of Surrey, Mike Soper, that believes an organisation with a turnover in excess of \u00a370m requires, first and foremost, someone who can handle that aspect, with cricket secondary. That would turn on its head Lamb's clinching soundbite about cricket being a business within a sport. </p> <p>Cricket matters can be delegated; it is not so easy with the business side. In this regard financial constraints may have been a consideration: a package that includes a salary in excess of \u00a3170,000 is not to be sniffed at but there is a feeling that the calibre of person Soper had in mind would not be available at such a price. </p> <p>Collier will not be fazed by the internal machinations of his new job. His varied background, including spells with three counties - Essex, Gloucestershire and Leicestershire - prior to Nottinghamshire, a time away from the game with the travel, leisure and tourism division of Sema, the Cheshire-based computer systems company, and connections with the administration of the English Hockey Association, give him his broad base. The sympathetic manner in which Trent Bridge has been redeveloped, moreover, is a further testament to careful use of funds. </p> <p>He will, though, find a broad raft of issues awaiting that will be outside his previous experience, including the renegotiation of broadcasting rights, international relations and a brief to tighten up the way funds from Sport England are to be used if they are to be continued. </p> <p>Of these it is the latter that may most occupy his immediate energies. The allocation of broadcasting rights is already well advanced - and the board's immediate issue with Zimbabwe will have been and gone, although there will be bridges still to be mended with the international cricket community. </p> <p>The prospect, though, of not retaining a share of Sport England's \u00a3100m is something that the game can neither contemplate nor afford. </p> <p><strong> Honest broker who helped hockey out of a corner</strong><br> </p> <p> When David Collier, pictured right, was appointed vice-president of the English Hockey Association in 2001 the governing body was insolvent. Within a year, debts of more than \u00a31m were uncovered -future obligations taking the figure as high as \u00a31.5m - and the chief executive Richard Wyatt had fallen on his sword. </p> <p>Collier, also a well-respected international hockey umpire, was one of the team of honorary officials charged with finding a way through the financial morass, which could have left the clubs with the responsibility for the debts. More than \u00a3600,000 was owed in VAT alone. Collier opened negotiations and contributed to reducing the figure to more manageable proportions -it was initially halved then halved again. </p> <p>Stewart Newton, a millionaire Brighton businessman, provided the interim funds to keep the sport afloat, and the EHA president Mike Corby led a management team. Collier was seen as an honest and reliable broker who did much unsung work, and although he had no formal role once the new governing body was up and running in mid-2002, he continued to offer advice. Only recently have the debts been resolved, creditors receiving 30p in the pound. </p> <p><strong>Challenges awaiting the new man in cricket's hot seat</strong></p> <p><strong> International relations</strong> </p> <p> By the time David Collier takes up his post full-time in the new year England will be engaged in a Test series in South Africa and, for the players at least, their November fortnight in Zimbabwe will be a distant memory. But for the new chief executive the damage done to the ECB's reputation within the International Cricket Council is an unavoidable reality. </p> <p>Collier will have to gain the respect of his fellow national board chief executives quickly and establish a healthy working relationship with them if the ECB is not to continue to be outmanoeuvred in the future. An ongoing project, but an important one. </p> <p> <strong> Finances and commercial relations</strong> </p> <p> The key challenge. The ECB's annual turnover of \u00a370m will represent something of an increase for the Nottinghamshire chief executive, used to the more modest sums involved in handling a county balance sheet. The looming threat of debt will be more familiar, however. The ECB has a negligible reserve, a fact that explained its jumpiness over the threat of financial sanctions from the ICC over Zimbabwe. </p> <p>The ECB's major commercial contracts - with Npower and Vodafone - are also approaching the renegotiation stage and the structure of the game means cricket has access to only a reduced pool of commercial backers. </p> <p>A bright note comes in the form of a new TV deal, due to be finalised in the next few weeks. Negotiations are at an advanced stage, with Channel 4 thought to be favourites to renew its deal, but it is expected to have to match the last deal at least, worth \u00a3150m over three years. </p> <p>Collier will have an input into the final stages of negotiations even if he is not officially in post, and a positive outcome would see his tenure begin on the front foot. </p> <p> <strong> Structure</strong> </p> <p> Collier will find gathering dust in the in-tray he inherits a document called the Carpenter Review. He will be familiar with its contents, particularly its observations on the ECB's corporate governance. </p> <p>Bluntly David Carpenter concludes that \"this is the most difficult area in which to put forward clear recommendations due to the need to develop clear strategy and a lack of consensus on what the optimum structure should look like\". </p> <p>The committee-dominated structure militates against effective decision-making and does not serve the best interests of the game \"from playground to Test arena\". Any change would involve a weakening of the counties' power and potentially a clash with the ECB chairman David Morgan, the great conciliator. </p> <p> <strong> Overseas players</strong> </p> <p> The huge rise in the number of overseas players active in county cricket by virtue of their EU-born grandparents and the Kolpak ruling has the same potential to hinder the development of home-grown talent as the influx of foreign players has in football. Limiting the numbers of players not qualified for England would run counter to EU law, so the counties must be persuaded to show their commitment to the development of English cricket. </p> <p> <strong> Sport England</strong> </p> <p> From 2005 Sport England is to introduce a four-year funding cycle with all sports dependent on it meeting certain criteria. The ECB, which has been criticised recently by Sport England's chief executive Roger Draper, stands to gain millions from the arrangement but has much to prove. </p> <p>Business plans need to be on the table at Sport England in the new year and Collier will need to ensure that his is up to the mark if Sport England is to match the largesse of previous years. (County academies benefit from \u00a350,000 of Sport England funding each year, and the Loughborough base of the ECB academy was 85% paid for by the body.) Sport England may not be universally popular with the ECB board but Collier knows he cannot afford to ignore it. </p> <p> <strong> Recruitment</strong> </p> <p> Collier fills the most senior vacancy at the ECB but replacements for the communications director John Read, who worked with the recreational game and funding agencies, and the commercial director Mark Sibley are a matter of urgency.</p>"
