  "<p>Thirsk trainer David Barron has his sights set on a big prize with Imperial Sound after his runner obliged as an odds-on chance should at Ripon yesterday. </p> <p>The winner will now enjoy a short break before being prepared for a possible tilt at the \u00a3200,000 St Leger Yearling Stakes at Doncaster on September 8. </p> <p>\"You'd have been disappointed if he'd been beaten,\" said Barron. \"It was just like a work gallop. He had an impossible task at Newbury and I was just going to wait with him, but this race came up. </p> <p>\"I think he'll go for the Doncaster sales race now. I picked up 30 grand when Axis was third in it last year.\" </p> <p>Jockey Michael Hills chalked up a double on the card withBygone Days and Rehia. </p> <p>Darryll Holland was grounded in Cambridge when his plane did not take off due to fog, and Hills replaced him on Bygone Days who just held the late challenge of Inter Vision in the Armstrong Memorial Rated Stakes. </p> <p>\"I did get a bit of a scare. I wasn't sure he'd won,\" admitted owner Jack Hanson. </p> <p>Hills had initiated his double on Rehia, trained by his brother John. The 7-2 favourite was retained without a bid after taking the BBC Radio York Colin Hazelden Selling Handicap. </p> <p>Paul Hanagan gave Double Vodka a peach of a ride to land the Tommy Shedden Challenge Trophy. </p> <p>\"He gave him a lovely ride,\" said winning trainer Lynda Ramsden. \"The horse gets the mile and a quarter well, but we have nothing particular in mind for him at the moment.\" </p> <p>Hearthstead Dream took the closing Children's Day Handicap under an enterprising ride from Joe Fanning.</p>"
