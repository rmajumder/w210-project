  "<p>At least one part of Tottenham Hotspur's preparations for the new season is well in hand. They are limbering up nicely to ensure that White Hart Lane is shrouded in its usual atmosphere of confusion, conflict and mystery. Supporters, with only the sedating effects of pessimism to take the edge off their twitchiness, are likely to be feeling subdued before the new season is properly begun. </p> <p>The side have their 12th friendly match of the build-up against Celtic in Glasgow tonight, but all that action has failed to establish a settled environment. With several players injured the generally poor results are no cause for distress, but there will be true angst if a new regime is not bedding in at Spurs. </p> <p>Both Jacques Santini, the manager, and Frank Arnesen, the sporting director, have plenty of experience of those roles at other clubs, but the impression is being given of utter disorientation now that they have come to London. \"I hope to have a meeting with Mr Arnesen and Mr Levy to discuss our functions and how it will work,\" said Santini after the defeat by Cagliari at the weekend, tugging the chairman into the puzzle. </p> <p>It is difficult for fans to understand how job descriptions could not have been agreed long ago, when Santini, before Euro 2004, agreed to give up his post with France. He actually sounds puzzled and resentful over the workload facing his squad. \"The pre-season programme was not devised by me,\" he grumbled on Saturday. </p> <p>So everyone can just forget about Spurs for another year? The oddest thing about the club is that its strains ought to be relieved with ease. It cannot really be beyond mature figures such as Arnesen and Santini to collaborate rather than snipe at one another. Apart from anything else, a decidedly useful squad is waiting patiently for guidance in a reassuringly serene workplace. </p> <p>The composition of the staff may be a bit of a mystery. Some of the new names were probably found on a list that David Pleat left in his desk before being dismissed. Others, such as Basel's Thimoth\u00e9e Atouba, were most likely on Arnesen's laptop well before he parted with PSV Eindhoven. </p> <p>Despite the suggestion of disjointedness in the acquisition policy, fans at many other clubs would envy Spurs. However it has arisen, there is an emerging theme at White Hart Lane. The rejuvenation of the line-up was under way well before Arnesen and Santini came to town and it has gathered pace since they set to work. </p> <p>Thanks to a share issue, there has been money to spend. In January this year, Jermain Defoe arrived to join Freddie Kanout\u00e9 and the presently injured Robbie Keane, giving the club substantial presences in attack, even if the hope of nurturing Helder Postiga was soon abandoned. With that department attended to, eyes have turned to the midfield. </p> <p>Although Tottenham last night pulled out of negotiations to sign Danny Murphy from Liverpool, they have brought in Sean Davis and the Champions League winner Pedro Mendes for the centre of the pitch. With the approaches for Shaun Wright-Phillips of Manchester City and Nottingham Forest's Andy Reid, efforts are being made to invigorate the build-up play. </p> <p>With Ledley King developing apace, Simon Davies to return before long, Paul Robinson bought to resolve the goalkeeping question and Stephen Kelly equipped to take over from the departing Stephen Carr, it is remarkable that no follower of Spurs can spot an uplifting scene at White Hart Lane. Maybe they have been hurt too often, and the club has certainly dismayed them by installing a management regime without being clear as to quite how it will operate. </p> <p>None the less, Spurs may have broken their habit of signing footballers whose value only depreciates. That would be a turning point, since one of the prime areas of distinction between two clubs of inherently similar size is that Arsenal have often been inspired when investing in players. </p> <p>The team will not be battling for major honours, but they could start to carve out a new identity for themselves. Why should they not be a youthful team with a capacity for goalscoring that wins some popularity in the football community at large? It is a sign of how far Spurs have fallen that few are prepared to see them as more than relegation-zone toilers. </p> <p>If the misunderstandings and feuds continue, this may be one more year of dismay. That would be unforgivable when all that is needed is for some proven footballers with their peak years ahead of them to be handled. That achieved, trips to White Hart Lane could be a pleasure rather than a wretched duty.</p>",
  "The young, British-educated conductor making his UK debut at the opening concert of the Edinburgh international festival this week said yesterday that he had \"no optimism for the future\" for black children making it as the stars of classical music. <p>Canadian-born Kwam\u00e9 Ryan, 34, went to school in Britain and studied music at Cambridge University before continuing his training in Germany. </p> <p>But the message given to young, black people, particularly in North America, was, he said, that you can be a star athlete; you can be a pop star. </p> <p>\"But neither of those require a special education. To be a conductor you have to start very young and the awareness that that is a possibility for black children is not encouraged in schools or in the media. </p> <p>\"It's a question of exposure and it is a deficit that is passed on from generation to generation. Seeing droves of black people in opera houses and concert halls is the exception, and that means the seeds have been planted for the next 20 years. I am afraid I have no optimism for the future.\" </p> <p>He added: \"At no point in my career have I felt disadvantaged by my skin colour and at no point have I felt I have been advantaged for it.\" </p> <p>None the less, black conductors are rare in the classical music world and even in symphony orchestras it is unusual to see more than one or two black musicians. </p> <p>Ryan, who is barely known in Britain although he has a flourishing career in Germany, will make his UK conducting debut go with a bang: the Edinburgh opening concert is one of the most high profile evenings in the classical music calendar. Brian McMaster, the artistic director of the festival, said: \"I think he is a very exciting conductor.\" </p> <p>Ryan is one of many British or British-educated conductors who find working in Germany more attractive than the UK. </p> <p>He moved there initially for a year on an exchange with a German university, with the intention of returning to the UK. He was then invited to join a conducting class run by Peter Eotvos, a Hungarian composer and conductor. </p> <p>He said there was \"no question\" Germany provided a different context from Britain in which to work. \"Within a two hour drive of Freiburg, where I live, there are eight professional orchestras,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The repertory system in Germany is all about looking after people as they move up, rather than having to jump in at the deep end as you do in Britain,\" he said. </p> <p>Donald Runnicles, a Scottish conductor, was Ryan's predecessor at Freiburg Opera, where Ryan worked as general music director until last year. </p> <p>Daniel Harding, who some years back became the golden boy of British conducting, even being tipped as Sir Simon Rattle's successor at the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, has opted to work in Germany. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The man who built his Edinburgh fringe show around having sex with a different man every night may not get his way - after the gay website he was using suspended his profile on the site yesterday. </p> <p>Tim Fountain's act involves logging on to the Gaydar site, chatting with other members of the website and then getting the audience to vote on which one he should have sex with after the show. He then reports on the experience the following night. But he said: \"The show must go on. I don't know how - we'll have to see tonight.\"</p>",
  "<p>One in four employers do not believe it is worth spending money on training a pregnant worker, even though refusing to train an employee because she is pregnant is against the law, according to a new survey published today. </p> <p>Most firms have a positive attitude to pregnancy in the workplace and said they supported female staff who became pregnant. </p> <p>But the poll of 450 employers by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) also showed that 28% did not believe it was worth training someone who was pregnant. </p> <p>A similar number could not cite any of the statutory entitlements covering pregnancy such as maternity leave or time off to attend antenatal appointments. </p> <p>Managers said the most difficult issues to manage centred on whether a woman would return to work and on planning cover during maternity leave. </p> <p>Jenny Watson, deputy chairwoman of the EOC, said: \"Many organisations do handle pregnancy positively and as a result see business benefits, such as better retention rates and increased productivity. </p> <p>\"Yet the results of our new research suggest that significant numbers of employers have limited knowledge of the law, which may be preventing them from managing pregnancy effectively. </p> <p>\"Practical issues, such as arranging maternity cover, can also present problems for employers who want to treat pregnant employees fairly - but both large and small employers have told us that these practical difficulties can be overcome, or at least minimised, through good planning and dialogue,\" Said Ms Watson.</p> <p>The survey was conducted as part of the EOC's investigation into pregnancy discrimination in the workplace. </p> <p>Dianah Worman, diversity adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said: \"After well over a quarter of a century of legislation to protect women from discrimination, and new legislation in the 1990s to protect pregnant workers, these figures show how deep-seated discrimination is, and how difficult it is to overcome. </p> <p>\"In a tight labour market, employers are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit and retain suitably skilled staff. Training is recognised as one way you can hang on to people who might otherwise leave. </p> <p>\"Employers choosing not to train loyal and experienced staff because they are pregnant risk losing them to competitors. </p> <p>\"Not offering training to pregnant staff is bad business. It could reduce the commitment of staff to the organisation, mean you get less from your people, lower retention rates and make it more difficult to recruit replacements for the people you drive away.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Trade and Industry said: \"This research shows that most good employers are committed to giving pregnant employees a fair deal at work. We welcome the EOC's consultation and look forward to their final report.\" </p>"
