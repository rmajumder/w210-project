  "Wherever British troops are sent, it will be a vastly different proposition to the one facing them in southern Iraq. <p>So far no British soldiers have been exposed to the relentless wave of suicide bombings and attacks unleashed by the mainly Sunni insurgents operating around Baghdad, but if the 650-strong battle group of the Black Watch regiment is deployed north that will inevitably change.</p> <p>One of the places British troops are expected to take over, the town of Latifiya, was yesterday the scene of one of Iraq's latest massacres when nine policemen returning from training in Jordan were ambushed and killed on their way home to Karbala.</p> <p>The town is also thought to have been where insurgents held Ken Bigley, the British hostage kidnapped and beheaded by Tawhid and Jihad, the terrorist group led by the Jordanian extremist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.</p> <p>The town, along with nearby Iskandariya - the other proposed base for British troops in the north - has been the scene of attacks by insurgents and lies on a crucial supply route for militants holed up in the stronghold of Falluja.</p> <p>In February a huge truck bomb exploded outside a police station in Iskandariya, killing more than 50 recruits who had been standing in line to join up.</p> <p>America has more than 138,000 troops in Iraq, which has led to speculation as to why they need 650 British soldiers to make the arduous journey from Basra north.</p> <p>But in reality the US army is stretched to breaking point. Of the 1,234 coalition deaths in Iraq, 1,095 have been American. Six American soldiers were killed over the weekend in car bombings and helicopter crashes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, foreign troops are leaving the coalition, including 1,400 Spanish soldiers, 370 Hondurans and 300 from the Dominican Republic in recent months. Military sources said the role of British troops would be to \"backfill\" behind a unit of the marine expeditionary unit, freeing them up for the assault on Falluja.</p> <p>Nearly half of the US soldiers in Iraq are reservists rather than frontline combat troops, but the British military remains concerned it is being used to support the American political agenda before the presidential election next month. \"There is unease about us being drawn in to the whole American election thing,\" one source said.</p> <p>Up until now British troops have been based exclusively in the southern sector of the country. During the summer British forces came under continuous attack from Iraqi insurgents for more than 65 days. But it cannot be compared with the American experience in central Iraq. The casualty figures speak for themselves: more than 1,000 US forces have been killed; 68 British.</p> <p>British defence sources played down the significance of troops being placed under the overall command of an American brigade headquar ters in the Baghdad area. They said that the whole operation in Iraq - including a British-controlled area in the south-east - was already under American command. \"We were under US command during the first Gulf war, we have been under American command in Nato, so it's not a big deal,\" a British military spokesman in Basra said yesterday.</p> <p>However, senior British military commanders have expressed concern about the different rules of engagement governing British and US troops. \"It is a cultural thing,\" said one source. \"We are not suddenly going to hose down housing estates in Iraq,\" referring to what British commanders regard as a heavy-handed American approach that they believe has proved counter-productive in the past.</p> <p>Sources also expressed \"real concern\" that the redeployment of the Black Watch would leave a significant gap in British forces in southern Iraq and mean delaying the training of Iraqi security forces in the Basra region.</p> <p>Concern about the timing of the American request for British help is believed to have been expressed by General Sir Michael Walker, chief of the defence staff, and General Sir Mike Jackson, the head of the army.</p> <p>It is not the first time the Americans have made noises about wanting British troops to carry some of the load outside of the south of the country. In April the British were leaned on by the US military to provide a unit in south-central Iraq to replace the Spanish troops who were pulled out after the bombings in Madrid.</p> <p>If the government had not vetoed the plan it would have taken British troops into the troubled town of Najaf, the home of the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, just before the uprising in the holy city.</p>",
  "There is an elderly woman with a long-winded anecdote about the old days on the prairies; a farmer with a desperate appeal for drought assistance and lower petrol prices; and a set of African refugees who want a group photograph of themselves. <p>Tom Daschle, the most powerful Democrat in Washington, has time for them all. </p> <p>The party's Senate leader stays long after a Sioux Falls community dinner was due to finish, until the last question is answered, and the last anxious words are heard. The tables have all been dismantled and the chairs neatly stacked. </p> <p>For the first time since he entered the Senate in 1986, Mr Daschle is fighting for his political survival. But there is much more than his career in play. Control of the Senate is also at stake, and all that that means - a legislative veto, the right to ratify foreign treaties and the power to shape the supreme court. </p> <p>The Republicans have a two-vote majority in the Senate. The Democrats have an outside chance of overturning that margin, but virtually no chance if their Senate leader loses this excruciatingly tight race to a popular and photogenic Republican, John Thune. \"This is a very pivotal election,\" Mr Daschle said in an interview after the last potential voter had drifted out into the cool, prairie night. \"We can't win back the Senate without winning this race, and the president himself has said this is the second-most important race in the country. It's become the most expensive race per capita in American political history.\" </p> <p>If George Bush is re-elected, Mr Daschle will continue to be the Democrats' last line of defence against the president's second-term agenda. If John Kerry wins the presidency, on the other hand, the senator from South Dakota will be his right-hand man in Congress. </p> <p>Either way, it will make an enormous difference if Mr Daschle is leader of the minority, as is the case now, or of the majority - in which case he will have a decisive say in the Senate's order of business, and his office will become a power centre to rival the White House. \"We are involved on a regular basis, we confirm all ambassadors and ratify all treaties, so it has a huge importance,\" Mr Daschle said. \"The next president and the next Senate are likely to confirm two or three new supreme court justices. There is little doubt that the direction the supreme court takes over the next 20 or 30 years will be determined at this election.\" </p> <p>In America's ongoing culture wars, control of the supreme court is even more important than residency of the White House. The court alone will determine whether the US is a country where abortion is legal, whether restrictions on stem cell research are legalised, whether there are gay marriages, and whether the death penalty is maintained, restricted or banned. </p> <p>Both parties have poured millions into the sparsely populated state, where there are barely 400,000 voters and where the politics are decidedly retail. The big issues are drought, the future of the corn-based fuel, ethanol, guns, and the plight of the Indian reservations, and of a pesky rodent, the prairie dog. </p> <p>The airwaves are choked with campaign advertisements but in a race that will be probably be decided by a few hundred votes either way, both Mr Daschle and Mr Thune know the only real way to clinch a floating vote is to meet every possible voter in person. </p> <p>Hence Mr Daschle's long night at the Sioux Falls com munity centre, and Mr Thune's insistence on as many debates as possible. His campaign asked for 25. The Daschle camp finally agreed to six. </p> <p>The encounters are a far cry from the much-hyped presidential debates, after which a 100 smooth-talking surrogates flood a packed media hall with spin. At a recent Daschle-Thune debate in the small university town of Vermillion, there were two journalists in attendance and Mr Thune did all the post-debate spin himself. He agreed with his opponent that the election was particularly critical in view of the Senate's role in approving new supreme court justices. </p> <p>Mr Thune stops short of saying that a new court should overturn the landmark \"Roe v Wade\" decision that legalised abortion in 1973, saying only: \"The president is not going to have a litmus test, but I do think it means that he will be able to appoint justices who will interpret the constitution.\" </p> <p>As ever in the heated culture wars, the remarks are coded to send an encouraging signal to conservatives, but remain outwardly vague for others. </p> <p>Mr Thune has a lot going for him electorally, as well as the $2m or more that the national Republican party has devoted to winning Mr Daschle's scalp. The former congressman has a vote-winning combination of distinguished grey hair and strong-jawed film star looks - a midwestern version of Robert Kilroy-Silk. He is also a nimble and aggressive debater, arguably stronger than the softly-spoken senator. </p> <p>Again and again at the Vermillion debate, Mr Thune accused his opponent of being \"the chief obstructionist\" in Washington, blocking legislation for the sake of political advantage. He echoed the Wall Street Journal's judgment that the Senate had become the \"Daschle Dead Zone\" for new laws. Each slogan landed with the force of a punch and won cheers from a largely conservative crowd of South Dakotan students. </p> <p>In a mostly conservative state, where 58% of voters are registered Republicans, Mr Thune is playing to a home audience. </p> <p>Mr Daschle's Senate tenure, by contrast, has always been something of an anomaly. He has held on to his seat by cultivating his constituents, making sure he visited every county in the state each term in a 1971 Pontiac, until the old car fell apart. </p> <p>He has also campaigned to the right of the Democratic mainstream. This time, for example, one of his advertisements shows him hugging President Bush a few days after the September 11 attacks. It is not an image that goes down well with hardcore supporters but it helps counter allegations that he is no more than a partisan obstructionist. </p> <p>The senator has also burned some of his bridges with environmentalists by turning against the cuddly prairie dog, blamed by ranchers for eating their pastures. Mr Daschle now backs poisoning them in large numbers. </p> <p>Most of all, Mr Daschle is campaigning on the clout of his office as a Senate leader. It means, he repeatedly points out, this is a moment in history when one of the most important desks in the country is controlled by South Dakota. </p> <p>The Daschle camp is hoping that this pragmatic appeal will be enough to win over at least one in five of the state's registered Republicans, just enough to outweigh Mr Thune's party advantage, and that the margin of victory will be secured by mobilising the state's 40,000 long-suffering Sioux Indians, who are just waking up to their own political leverage. If the election is as tight as it promises to be, they could well determine who controls the US Senate.</p>",
  "<p>The education secretary, Charles Clarke, today confirmed that the government would publish a white paper on 14-19 curriculum reform which would represent the \"biggest single reform of qualifications in any of our lifetimes\".</p> <p>He \"wholeheartedly\" welcomed the proposals put forward today by the working group chaired by the former chief inspector of schools Mike Tomlinson, and promised that the government would respond with a programme of reform which would be bigger than the introduction of grammar schools in the 1940s, the introduction of the A-levels in the 1950s and the dawn of GCSEs in the 1980s.</p> <p>The Department for Education and Skills is believed to already be working on an implementation plan for the reforms ahead of the white paper which Mr Clarke said would come in the new year. </p> <p>But Mr Clarke fell short of promising that the new diploma recommended by Mr Tomlinson would replace GCSEs and A-levels, leaving it open to speculation whether GCSEs and A-levels would be scrapped or not. </p> <p>He also appeared to reject the working party's proposal to scrap external assessment at 16 in a bid to free-up students and teachers from excessive workload and their headteachers from excessive exam bills. </p> <p>He told the House of Commons: \"I am determined that any evolution of the system must increase public confidence in it. Therefore my approach will be to build on all that is good in the current system, including the real and great strengths of A-levels and GCSEs. The Tomlinson report rightly confirms their place in the system and seeks to build on them. They would stay as the building blocks of any new system.\"</p> <p>Mr Tomlinson's report proposes the introduction of an overarching diploma for all pupils from the age of 14-19 which would be made up of modules, or components, derived from GCSEs and A-levels. However, they would not be called GCSEs and A-levels, they would be slimmed down and the assessment would be radically altered. </p> <p>As he launched the report this morning, Mr Tomlinson told a press conference that any \"cherry picking\" of some aspects of the report would not be as effective as a fullscale adoption of his plans. \"On the basis of previous attempts to reform 14 to 19 [education] there has been cherry picking. I hope there is not in this case.\"</p> <p>One fear is that the government would adopt the diploma, but not the reform the GCSEs and A-levels that go with it, leaving the whole system vulnerable if universities and employers rejected it and favoured pupils who had studied under the current system instead.</p> <p>Mr Clarke also indicated that the government would retain the league tables at 16, which rely on externally moderated exam marks to feed into the statistics. </p> <p>Mr Tomlinson wants to scrap external testing and his report says that it is \"self-evident\" that if the reforms go ahead the performance measures would have to change. </p> <p>\"We also believe it essential that full public accountability for results is maintained, including the publication nationally of exam results, school by school, at 16 and at 19,\" he said.</p> <p>The prime minister, Tony Blair, appeared to give initial support to the proposals during a visit to a specialist business and enterprise school in the West Midlands this afternoon, but added that his endorsement of the changes recommended in the Tomlinson report did not indicate he had lost faith in the current examination system. </p> <p>He said: \"We have got to constantly prepare for the future. That means making sure that children get the grounding in the basics of literacy and numeracy. </p> <p>\"It means actually strengthening GCSEs and A-levels and making sure in particular that at the top end, A-levels are made more stretching so that we're achieving more excellence throughout the education system.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair was touring the school with the director of the Confederation of British Industry, Digby Jones, whose organisation earlier today doubted that the new diploma would bring with it good enough basic skills to satisfy employers. </p> <p>Mr Blair is due to give a speech on the subject later tonight.</p>",
  "<p>Colleagues of beleaguered Tory MP and journalist Boris Johnson said today that they believed his job as Spectator editor would be safe in the face of intense criticism over a leader in the magazine, but that he may eventually be forced to choose between the two roles. </p> <p>The Barclay brothers, who recently bought the Spectator as part of their purchase of the Telegraph Group, are not believed to have put pressure on Johnson to choose between his career as an MP and his role as Spectator editor and Telegraph columnist. </p> <p>But privately, some are already questioning whether Johnson will be able to maintain his editorial independence as a journalist after agreeing to travel to Liverpool tomorrow or Wednesday to apologise in person at the behest of Conservative leader Michael Howard. </p> <p>One senior editorial figure at the Telegraph said that Peter Preston, writing about the row in today's Guardian, put it best when he said that Johnson could not continue to combine the two jobs and retain his editorial freedom. </p> <p>\"Journalism or politics? Boris, I think, has that most trendy of policy decisions to make now amid all his humility: he has a choice,\" wrote Preston. </p> <p>But others said that Johnson was capable of combining the two roles. Rod Liddle, the former editor of Radio 4's Today programme turned Spectator contributor, said that the MP for Henley-on-Thames was a \"brilliant editor\" who should be free to say what he thought. </p> <p>\"If this kind of thinking prevails, we'll be left with 659 Alan Milburns, devoid of independent thought. All the signs are that the public doesn't want that,\" he said. </p> <p>\"As an editor, I don't see what the problem is. He will be forced into doing a typically political thing, which Tony Blair does all the time, which is to apologise without actually apologising,\" added Liddle. </p> <p>Liddle said that Tory leader Michael Howard was wrong to force Johnson to apologise, pointing out that the Spectator ran a wide range of articles that disagreed with Tory policy. </p> <p>\"From a personal point of view, we have deeply divergent views about politics but I've had less interference from Boris Johnson than any other editor I've worked for. Above all else, he believes in freedom of speech,\" said Liddle. </p> <p>The MP for Henley has been criticised over an article that claimed Liverpudlians were \"hooked on grief\". He also blamed drunken fans for contributing to the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, which claimed 96 lives. </p> <p>Johnson has admitted he received a \"tremendous kick in the pants\" from Mr Howard, a Liverpool fan, but said he had been \"stunned\" by the reaction to the article. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "The latest round of polls in the US election race shows the presidential candidates more or less tied, with Democratic hopeful John Kerry trailing Republican president George Bush by two or three percentage points, a gap still within a margin of error. <p>The latest <a href=\"http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=892\">Zogby/Reuters daily tracking poll</a> found Mr Kerry had shaved two points from the president's lead, leaving the Democrat trailing 46% to 44%. The poll of those who describe themselves as likely to vote in the November 2 election was conducted after the third and final presidential debate. The margin of error was 2.9 percentage points. </p> <p>John Zogby said on his website: \"The third debate is now registering among voters and Kerry had a good day, leading by two points today alone. He now is behind by only two overall. He managed today to regain a good lead among 18-29 year olds (especially 18-24 year olds, who he will need on November 2 to win). He also has consolidated his lead among Hispanics and is now only yielding 12 points to Bush among Democrats.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/election2004/article/0,18471,725047,00.html\">latest Time magazine poll</a> again put Mr Bush two points ahead of Mr Kerry, 48% to 46%, or fairly even once the margin of error is taken into account. It found Mr Kerry was the clear winner of the last debate, with almost one in three voters saying the debate had made them more likely to vote Democratic. Only 17% said the debate had made them more likely to vote for Mr Bush. </p> <p>Time also said Mr Bush's job approval rating had fallen, with 49% approving of his work and 49% disapproving after the last debate. The magazine said it was the second week in a row that the president polled under 50% on job approval. </p> <p><a href=\" http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6260444/site/newsweek/ \">Newsweek</a> came up with exactly the same headline numbers as Time: 48% for Mr Bush, 46% for Mr Kerry. The magazine reported that before the round of debates began on September 30 the president held an 11-point lead over Mr Kerry. </p> <p>But, among likely voters, Newsweek's statistics told a different story. A Bush/Cheney ticket took 50% of likely voters, with Kerry/Edwards on only 44%. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/polls/usatodaypolls.htm\">CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll</a>, also conducted after the debate, gave Mr Bush an even greater advantage. Among likely voters, 52% intended to vote for Mr Bush and 44% for Mr Kerry. The previous Gallup poll, conducted after the second debate, had given 49% to Mr Bush and 46% to Mr Kerry. The polls had a margin of error of four percentage points. </p> <p>Independent candidate Ralph Nader polled a fairly consistent 1% in all the above contests, meaning he could well prove a spoiler for Mr Kerry.</p>"
