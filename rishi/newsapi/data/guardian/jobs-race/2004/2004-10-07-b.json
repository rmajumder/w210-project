  "<b> Life before</b> <br> <p>Shopping for clothes means one thing to me: standing outside a changing room in, say, Diesel/LK Bennett/Zara/Jigsaw/M&amp;S/Joseph/Gap - they all blur after a while - waiting for Jane to try something on while I bemoan the lost opportunity to be at home watching Football Focus. I really can't think of many things I'd rather be doing less. I'm of the uniquely male mentality, it seems, that clothes shopping is a mundane, functional fact of life that should be performed with near-military precision and efficiency: ie get in there, get the job done, and extract yourself as fast as possible.</p> <p>I'm not ashamed to say that I'm entirely happy for Jane to dress me. Not literally, of course: I mean when Jane comes home from a shopping trip (from bitter experience, she now usually goes alone or with friends) and hands me a bag of clothes and says, \"Here, I bought these for you.\" It's an arrangement that suits us both.</p> <p><b> The ethical audit</b><br></p> <p>The auditors: <b>Hannah Berry</b>, writer and researcher at Ethical Consumer magazine; <b>Mike Childs</b>, campaigns director at Friends of the Earth; <b>Renee Elliott</b>, council member of the Soil Association and founder of Planet Organic shops</p> <p>Hannah begins by asking us questions about what sort of clothes we wear and where we buy them. My response takes a lot less time than Jane's. \"From what you say,\" says Hannah, \"it suggests that you tend to go for quality rather than label-laden clothes. And you don't suffer from Imelda Marcos tendencies.\"</p> <p>I look to Jane to see how she has taken this woman-to-woman fashion assessment. This could be quite a volatile part of the ethical audit, given her sensitivity to the threat of being told to change the way she dresses. \"This is positive,\" says Hannah (dressed in jeans, T-shirt and velour hooded top), probably sensing the tension, \"because the overconsumption of clothing driven by fashion is taking a huge toll on the environment.\"</p> <p>\"Like most people, you buy your clothes on the high street,\" says Mike (jeans and green cotton shirt). \"While this scores highly on the convenience front, it leaves a lot to be desired from an ethical point of view. Mass-produced fashion is a globalised industry, raising concerns about sweatshop labour, health, safety and environmental standards, as well as the environmental concerns associated with goods being transported around the world. Cheap fashions tend to be disposable in nature, with few garments designed to last more than a season.\"</p> <p>Using the word \"cheap\" in relation to our clothes seems potentially incendiary, so I look to Renee (black trousers and cream silk twinset). \"I don't think you're wearing organic clothes, are you? You look too trendy,\" she says.</p> <p>I smile, but again I'm not sure flattery is going to win Jane over. \"But,\" continues Renee, \"it is worth considering organic cotton, particularly for baby Esme, because cotton is the most highly sprayed textile in the world. It accounts for nearly 25% of the total global insecticide market. If you choose fabrics made from organic cotton, you are getting clothes that not only do not carry pesticide residues but are also not bleached with chlorine dyes, nor coloured with heavy metal dyes.</p> <p>\"You should also try to avoid fabrics that are 'easy care' or 'non-iron'. Many have been treated with formaldehyde - classified by the US Environmental Protection Agency as a probable human carcinogen under conditions of 'unusually high or prolonged exposure'.\"</p> <p>Jane asks about the breadth of organic clothing now on offer. \"Organic clothes are also available in hemp and wool,\" says Renee. \"There are now dozens of companies producing a wide range of organic clothes, including jeans, T-shirts and yoga wear. Some of these are fashionable and well designed.\"</p> <p>Hannah agrees that hunting down clothes made from organic textiles is an important step when sourcing clothes. \"As well as being heavily sprayed with pesticides, cotton - 45% of which is now genetically modified - is also one of the most heavily irrigated crops. In countries with weak or nonexistent pollution controls, where dyeing activities are concentrated, reactive dyes and wastes are regularly flushed straight into watercourses. Also, petrochemical-derived synthetic fabrics are often non-biodegradable.\"</p> <p>I ask about the issue of sweatshops. \"It almost goes without saying that the price of our clothes-buying addiction is paid by those at the bottom of the supply chain,\" responds Hannah. \"But you should note that high-profile workers' rights campaigns, targeted at well-known clothing brands, are not always calls for a consumer boycott. They are often about getting companies to ensure that subcontractors provide fair wages and conditions, and persuading them not to relocate whenever abuses are exposed, thereby leaving workers without jobs.</p> <p>\"The websites <a href=\"http://www.cleanclothes.org\">www.cleanclothes.org</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sweatshopwatch.org\">www.sweatshopwatch.org</a> both explain the difference between 'worker-called' boycotts, which should be supported, and campaigns which prefer customers to routinely question retailers on, for example, whether they enforce an independently monitored code of conduct, and fix prices to suppliers in function of what is needed for them to pay a living wage.\"</p> <p>Jane makes the point that she has never seen any clothing in the shops that promises to answer these concerns. Mike nods. \"But alternatives for the ethical shopper do exist. However, they tend to involve extra effort or extra cash. Ethical clothing outlets can be found, especially online, with manufacturers such as Ethical Threads. Naturalcollection.com includes more environmentally friendly clothing and, although it is unlikely to satisfy logo junkies, it does the job with some style.\"</p> <p>Another option, says Mike, is to buy second-hand clothes. \"Acquiring the second-hand habit requires practice and a creative approach to style, but can be a cheaper way to stock your wardrobe. Alternatively, if you have time and the skills, you could try making your own clothes. Some claim that knitting is the latest craze - and it can be far more relaxing than a trudge down the high street, or so I'm told.\"</p> <p>And don't forget to give your cast-offs to charity shops such as Oxfam so that they can resell or recycle them, adds Renee.</p> <p>Jane concludes with a question about her favourite subject: shoes. \"Can I buy leather shoes?\" she asks. Hannah doesn't answer directly, but makes a general point about how animals are used to make clothes. \"Around 10% of an animal's value is in its skin, so leather isn't entirely a by-product of the meat industry. Non-leather, non-PVC footwear ordered through, for example, Vegetarian Shoes [<a href=\"http://www.vegetarian- shoes.co.uk\">www.vegetarian- shoes.co.uk</a>, tel 01273 691913] or Green Shoes [<a href=\"http://www.greenshoes.co.uk\">www.greenshoes.co.uk</a>, tel 01803 864997] can often take account of sweatshop concerns as well as animal welfare ones.\"</p> <p><b> Life after</b><br></p> <p>Jane wasn't sold on the idea of ethical clothing. At all. The bottom line, she said after the auditors had left, was that she wouldn't wear anything that she didn't like and feel comfortable in.</p> <p>I was always going to be on thin ice when it came to trying to coax Jane into reassessing her - our - wardrobe, and she was far from impressed by the ethical clothing mail-order catalogues that arrived. But she did agree to go on an ethical shopping trip with me: \"You'll get to go out to the shops like normal and I'll get to act on the auditors' advice,\" I said.</p> <p>My mistake was thinking that London would offer myriad options on the ethical clothes front. But other than the local charity shops, I was left scratching my head. However, after some research online, I found that two ethical retailers had recently opened in central London - American Apparel in Carnaby Street and People Tree in Selfridges on Oxford Street.</p> <p>I also found out there was a Traid shop in Brixton, near where we live - a shop I had always assumed to be a charity shop, but learned was actually a good place to find \"vintage\" clothes and secondhand designer wear.</p> <p>After much hunting around in Selfridges, we found the People Tree concession on the second floor. People Tree, I had learned on their website (<a href=\"http://www.ptree.co.uk\">www.ptree.co.uk</a>, tel 0845-450 4595), uses organic cotton and helps \"marginalised producers to improve their lives by giving design and quality skills, a fair price, regular orders, and advance payment as needed\". But Jane stood in front of the two racks, looked at the merchandise, waved her hand in front of it and said, \"No, to all of that.\" To be fair to her, it was a little too, in her words, \"80s retro\".</p> <p>We then went to Carnaby Street in search of American Apparel (<a href=\"http://www.americanapparel.co.uk\">www.americanapparel.co.uk</a>, tel 020-7734 4477), whose clothes are produced \"sweatshop-free\" in a factory in Los Angeles where employees are paid $12.50 an hour, more than double the minimum wage. As this was an entire shop over two floors, there was much more to choose from - even if we did feel a little out of place among the skater kids who seemed to be its target demographic. We bought some T-shirts and tops and even some things for Esme.</p> <p>The trip to Traid (eight shops in London and Brighton, <a href=\"http://www.traid.org.uk\">www.traid.org.uk</a>, tel 020-8733 2580) was successful, too. For me at least. Jane just couldn't get over her phobia of wearing second-hand clothes, but I managed to find a pair of jeans (\u00a315) and a John Rocha jacket (\u00a330).</p> <p>The one thing missing from my \"new head-to-toe ethical look\", as Jane mocked, was a pair of shoes. Hannah had told me that Adbusters (<a href=\"http://www.adbusters.org\">www.adbusters.org</a>), the Canadian anti-corporate magazine, sold a pair of trainers that were \"sweatshop-free\", but then I heard that a similar concept trainer, made by US-based No Sweat Apparel (<a href=\"http://www.nosweatapparel.com\">www.nosweatapparel.com</a>), was available in the UK through Fair Deal Trading (<a href=\"http://www.fairdealtrading.com\">www.fairdealtrading.com</a>, tel 0870 766 5196). They looked a little like a pair of Converse All Star sneakers I had as a child, and for \u00a325 seemed like good value, too.</p> <p>For more about Leo's experiment, and the chance to post your own views and tips, visit <a href=\"http://www.money.theguardian.com/ethicalliving\">money.theguardian.com/ethicalliving</a> Leo's next report, on volunteering, will appear in two weeks.</p>",
  "<p>It's about sustainable management of the animal population. And, supporters say, it keeps local people interested in conservation. </p> <p>This week in Bangkok, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) decided to allow South Africa and Namibia to kill and export up to five black rhinos each a year. </p> <p>The rhinos have been in decline since the 1970s due to hunting and competition with people for land. By the 1990s, there were only 2,400 left in the wild, down from more than 60,000 some 20 years earlier. Parts of the rhino are prized in the Far East for use in traditional medicines and the horn is used in the Middle East to make dagger handles. </p> <p>Craig Hilton-Taylor of the World Conservation Union, which produces the annual lists of worldwide endangered species, says limited hunting of endangered species is not all bad. In Namibia and South Africa, numbers are increasing. </p> <p>\"The reserves the animals are in are now reaching capacity. They can't hold more animals, otherwise they start injuring each other and causing problems,\" he says. The extra animals must then be moved into other reserves, placed in zoos or culled. </p> <p>Moving animals from one conservation park to another is difficult and expensive. There is also the problem of moving genetic stock of a species to an area where it has never occurred before. \"You're mixing genes and that can cause a huge problem conservation-wise further down the line,\" says Hilton-Taylor. The other option, culling, benefits nobody. </p> <p>\"If you can allow hunting or whatever generates revenue that can be put back into conservation for the species, then that is a very worthwhile cause to follow,\" says Hilton-Taylor. He adds that this has to be done sustainably, however, and only with animals whose numbers are recovering in the wild. South Africa and Namibia have had good track records in conserving black rhinos in recent years - numbers are up 40% over the past decade.</p>"
