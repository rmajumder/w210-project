  "<p>The Manchurian Candidate of 1962, directed by John Frankenheimer from Richard Condon's thriller, is a chunk of America's psycho-history - as much oracle as movie - steeped in what Norman Mailer called \"that concentration of ecstasy and violence which is the dream life of the nation\". Not surprisingly, Jonathan Demme's remake, conceived in the aftermath of 9/11 and opening in the midst of the 2004 presidential campaign, has been received as an intervention, a desecration, a revision and an all-purpose metaphor. </p> <p>Condon's 1959 bestseller featured a Korean war hero created and programmed by the Chinese communists to serve as the \"sleeper\" assassin who will allow anti-communist triple agents to stage an election year coup d'etat. In essence, Condon suggested the cold war was a Soviet-American co-production. US electoral politics were represented as the province of communist dupes and zombie secret agents, while the novel's demagogic Joseph McCarthy figure himself turned out to be a Soviet creation. One brain washed the other; left- and right-wing paranoia merged. The scenario was nothing less than a satiric version of the John Birch Society's Black Book, which held President Dwight D Eisenhower to be a dedicated servant of the international communist conspiracy. </p> <p>Produced by its star Frank Sinatra's company and released by United Artists, The Manchurian Candidate became the quintessential Kennedy-era thriller. Indeed, there's a sense in which the movie is the Kennedy era - the epitome of glamour and anxiety, an anthology of cold- war anxieties ranging from TV image-building to communist infiltration of the government, which materialised at the height of the Cuban missile crisis to startle audiences with a baroque tale of mind-control, assassination and conspiracy. </p> <p>Sinatra was known to be a presidential pal and, when the Democratic honchos who then ran UA deemed The Manchurian Candidate too controversial to touch, Kennedy proved instrumental in getting the movie made. (Although JFK previewed The Manchurian Candidate at the White House in late August 1962, history does not record his response. Perhaps he was distracted - that day a U-2 spy plane had reported eight missile installations in Cuba that were only weeks away from being operational.) Two months later, The Manchurian Candidate had its premiere as Soviet ships steamed towards the US quarantine line surrounding Cuba, and Under-Secretary of State George Ball warned UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson that there could be a \"shooting war\" by the following afternoon. </p> <p> The Manchurian Candidate opened at the climax of the cold war and fulfilled its prophetic mission 13 months later when Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. One researcher recently proposed The Manchurian Candidate as the \"trigger film\" for the ex-marine, returned defector, sniper-or-patsy Lee Harvey Oswald. There's no proof that Oswald ever saw or even heard of The Manchurian Candidate but, even so, the circuit is complete: the movie Kennedy inspired also served as his death warrant. </p> <p>That the Manchurian candidate is a myth may be gauged by two seemingly indestructible misapprehensions, both regularly reiterated in reviews of Demme's remake. The first is the stubborn insistence that the 1962 movie had been a commercial failure and was thus an arcane message or a missed prophecy. In fact, having supplanted Darryl Zanuck's D-Day epic The Longest Day, The Manchurian Candidate reigned as national box-office champ (just in time for Kennedy's mid-term elections). The second misapprehension is that, following the Kennedy assassination, a remorseful Sinatra withdrew the movie from circulation. On the contrary: The Manchurian Candidate was re-released in early 1964 and, revived in the 1970s, it was used to \"explain\" the election-altering shootings of Martin Luther King, Robert Kennedy and George Wallace. (Truman Capote made waves in 1968 when he proposed on The Tonight Show that RFK assassin Sirhan Sirhan was a programmed \"Manchurian candidate\".) </p> <p>Six months after the Wallace shooting in 1972, and a decade after The Manchurian Candidate's initial release, Sinatra reasserted his rights in a contractual dispute with UA and the movie disappeared from cinemas, if not television or popular consciousness. The Manchurian Candidate 's extremely literal and highly fanciful view of behavioural modification remained topical, particularly after revelations of CIA mind-control experiments became public in the mid-1970s. Some 25 years after its release, a network television documentary based on John Marks' 1980 CIA expos\u00e9, The Search for the Manchurian Candidate, used clips from the Frankenheimer film to illustrate its thesis. </p> <p>Slick and sombre, Demme's new Candidate lacks the giddy insolence of its predecessor. The tale of a programmed \"sleeper\" assassin, a high-level political conspiracy, and an election-year coup isn't played for gleeful dark comedy; the update recalls Alan Pakula's post-Watergate, crypto- Manchurian remake The Parallax View as much as Frankenheimer's original. Gone is Frankenheimer's svelte Resnais-influenced integration of dreams, flashbacks and daylight reality. The cold war is no longer the nightmare from which Frank Sinatra is trying to awake. Rather, it's the new world order. The bogus military hero Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) and his commanding officer (Denzel Washington in the Sinatra role) have their brains washed during Operation Desert Storm; the title now refers to the mega- corporate Manchurian Global, part Halliburton, part Carlyle Group. Coup d'\u00e9tat has been reformulated as \"regime change\" and there's a red-meat evocation of \"the first privately owned and operated vice president of the United States\". </p> <p>Sinatra's daughter Tina had long been interested in a Manchurian remake, but the project was only given the go-ahead in September 2001. The new version was co-produced by Democratic activist Scott Rudin for Paramount Pictures, whose head of production, Sherry Lansing, is a contributor to the Kerry campaign - as is Sumner Redstone, CEO of Paramount's corporate parent, Viacom. (Paramount has also released Hollywood's most scurrilous contribution to the political season, the raunchy puppet animation Team America: World Police.) Several writers were involved but, according to Rudin, once he and Daniel Pyne (who previously adapted The Sum of All Fears) shifted the emphasis to corporate chicanery, \"You could feel the script start to be alive.\" </p> <p>The second Manchurian Candidate belongs to Bush II nearly as much as the original did to JFK. The movie was in production during the run-up to and early months of the Iraq war, with dialogue rewritten in the light of unfolding events. And, from the opening theme, Wyclef Jean's cover of the anti-Bush anthem Fortunate Son , through the references to \"no-bid contracts\", computerised voting and constant terror alerts, to the elaboration of a corporate conspiracy to install a \"sleeper\" as president, the remake is an unambiguous attack on the current American administration. Despite the internet-fuelled rumour that Meryl Streep was evoking Hillary Clinton for her character, her portrayal of the candidate's mother is far more evocative of Bush aide Karen Hughes - or perhaps even Bush's own mother who, according to Kevin Phillips's American Dynasty, had spoken of becoming First Lady as early as the late 1940s. </p> <p>A week before the second Candidate opened, the New York Times economics columnist Paul Krugman, a relentless Bush critic, imagined a scenario for \"The Arabian Candidate\" in which Islamic fanatics installed a puppet US president who presented himself as the leader in a war against terrorism. Opening in the US less than 24 hours after the Democratic National Convention ended, the movie struck Krugman's colleague, the cultural pundit Frank Rich, as being so blatantly partisan that it \"could pass for the de facto fifth day of the convention itself\". </p> <p>Of course, rightwing websites were already attacking John Kerry as a Manchurian candidate - a bogus war hero under the control of billionaire George Soros - just as Bush's one-time Republican rival, Senator John McCain, had been smeared four years ago as another such \"candidate\", brainwashed in a North Vietnam POW camp. All of the candidates had their Manchurian aspect - not least the third-party perennial, Ralph Nader, who, as several commentators pointed out, seemed determined to ensure Bush's victory and thus a pro-corporate agenda he ostensibly opposes, in a second consecutive election. </p> <p>Demme's movie, too, has been attacked as a \"Naderite yelp against Democratic backsliding\" (The New Republic ), as well as characterised, more approvingly, \"the most extravagantly Chomskyite movie Hollywood has ever made\" (In These Times). Significantly, its release coincides with the remarkable success, at least in New York's alt-film world, of the Canadian horror-doc The Corporation, which applies the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to demonstrate that corporations are by nature psychopathic - self-absorbed, irresponsible, manipulative and unable to empathise or feel remorse. </p> <p>There's no need for a Joe McCarthy-like demagogue in the new Manchurian Candidate . Demagoguery has been dispersed, institutionalised and built into the workings of the national entertainment state that has rationalised, if not replaced, the old American dream life. Paranoia, in the Manchurian remake, is blatantly orchestrated, with a steady background of terrorist and counter-terrorist chatter and a sense of constant surveillance. Patriotic pageantry is even more hysterical and Pavlovian than in the original - and, in the deployment of heroic New York City firefighters and Mount Rushmore, makes a reasonably accurate prediction of Republican campaign ads. </p> <p>These days, regime change through the strategic elimination of political leaders is no longer an issue, at least in the US. Nor is the construction of history's secret agent. A mysterious squarish bulge visible beneath President Bush's suit jacket during his first debate with John Kerry led to much media speculation that he was wired with some sort of radio receiver. Still, the most retrograde aspect of the new Candidate is the use of the old-fashioned Jos\u00e9 Delgado-type brain implants. </p> <p>As demonstrated by the terror alerts that have figured in the current presidential campaign, along with the new Department of Homeland Security's blandly issued threat of a cancelled election, it's not the assassins who are being programmed with sinister microchips - it is America's body politic. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Manchurian Candidate is released on November 19. The Corporation is out now. J Hoberman is senior film critic at the Village Voice and author of The Dream Life: Movies, Media and the Mythology of the Sixties (The New Press).</p>",
  "South Africa's most prolific mass murderer was released on parole yesterday after serving 12 years in jail for a shooting spree that made him an apartheid folk hero. <p>Louis van Schoor is believed to have shot 101 black people, killing 39 of them, including children, while working as a security guard in the port city of East London.</p> <p>Praised by warders as a model prisoner, Van Schoor walked free yesterday thanks to a sentence reduction for all convicts issued by Nelson Mandela when he was president.</p> <p>The 53-year-old - appearing relaxed and cheerful -spoke to reporters outside the prison gates. He said he would not return to the security business, but would take up farming and spend time with his fianc\u00e9e, Eunice Cornelius, a Cape Town lawyer.</p> <p>He declared himself \"happy that the time has come to join society again\", and said he hoped the public would forget his past and judge him on his future.</p> <p>He had found God in prison. When prompted, he expressed sorrow to the relatives of his victims. \"I apologise if any of my actions caused them hurt,\" he said.</p> <p>Van Schoor was convicted in 1992 of killing seven people and attempting to murder another two under the guise of protecting business premises from thieves.</p> <p>Survivors testified that he captured and killed burglars before calling the police. When there were no thieves, he would drag pedestrians from the street into the premises and shoot them.</p> <p>Under apartheid, Van Schoor was protected by police officers and magistrates who commended his efficiency and overlooked the fact that all his victims were black or coloured and that not one carried a gun.</p> <p>He was arrested when the white minority regime crumbled, but prosecutors were able to charge him with only a fraction of his crimes. Just after his final murder, and before he realised his impunity was over, the Afrikaner boasted to a journalist: \"Number 39, pal.\"</p> <p>During his trial, white residents drove around East London with \"I Love Louis\" stickers on their cars, decorated with three bullet holes through a heart. Black residents called him Jesus because of his flowing beard.</p> <p>Van Schoor's daughter, Sabrina, ended up in another section of his jail in 2002 for paying a black man to slit the throat of his former wife, Beverley, on the grounds that she was a racist who objected to Sabrina's liaisons with non-whites.</p> <p>Van Schoor said yesterday that he would miss his daughter now he was out, but promised to look after her own daughter, who is of mixed race. Embracing his fianc\u00e9e, who may become his fifth wife, he told the Daily Dispatch newspaper that he had studied agriculture and worked in the prison's vegetable patch. There was a muted response to his release, which was ignored by most of the South African media.</p> <p>Relatives of his victims, who were mostly poor and uneducated, made no protest, possibly because they were not aware of the news. Heidi Holland, a journalist writing a book about Sabrina van Schoor, said the port city's white residents still esteemed Louis van Schoor, adding: \"There is no way East London is doing any soul-searching today.\"</p>",
  "A Black Watch soldier died today after a vehicle accident in Iraq. <p>The Ministry of Defence confirmed the solider died in the North Babil Province in Iraq during an incident which was not involving hostile action.</p> <p>A further three soldiers have suffered minor injuries and shock.

  "<p>Former Daily Telegraph proprietor Conrad Black will step down from the top job at his holding company Hollinger Inc within days, his lawyer said today.</p> <p>The announcement, which comes as Lord Black prepares to take the company private, came in a court hearing in Ontario, Canada, where the company is registered.</p> <p>His lawyer, Alan Mark, revealed in court that Lord Black intended to retire from his post as chairman and chief executive of Hollinger Inc.</p> <p>\"It will be a matter of days,\" Mr Mark told reporters after the hearing. \"Now that the process has started he wants to ensure that the board is unimpeded by any concerns or controversy, and to enable that to happen he is prepared to retire from the company.\" </p> <p>Lord Black's proposed move comes nearly a year after he stepped down as chief executive of Hollinger International, the publishing company in which Hollinger Inc is the controlling shareholder, amid allegations of financial impropriety.</p> <p>He was later removed as chairman, and relations between the peer and his old company deteriorated to the extent that the two are still mired in legal action.</p> <p>Hollinger International has alleged that Lord Black and his associates took millions of pounds out of the company in unauthorised payments, while the peer has sued the company and some of its directors for defamation, denying that he has done anything wrong.</p> <p>Then in July, Hollinger International ended Lord Black's 19-year association with the Telegraph, when it sold the newspaper and its stablemates, the Sunday Telegraph and Spectator magazine, in a \u00a3665m deal.</p> <p>Under an agreement struck earlier this week, Lord Black can share in the proceeds of the sale as long as he hangs on to his Hollinger International shares until January 31.</p> <p>Throughout the upheavals, Lord Black has remained chairman and chief executive of Hollinger Inc, which is 78%-owned by his private Ravelston corporation.</p> <p>Hollinger Inc's main asset is its 18.2% stake - and 68% of the voting rights - in Hollinger International.</p> <p>Today's court hearing dealt with an application from a minority shareholder in Hollinger Inc, Catalyst Fund General Partner, which sought to get Lord Black and four colleagues - co-chief operating officers Peter White and David Radler, executive vice-president Jack Boultbee, and the peer's wife Barbara Amiel - removed as directors. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>GlaxoSmithKline yesterday reported an acceleration in the development of a vaccine that guards against cervical cancer as it announced profits showing the effects of the weak dollar. </p> <p>Cervarix, a vaccine that can guard against the 70% of cervical cancer cases triggered by a virus, is proving so successful in preventing the disease that the company plans to file for regulatory approval two years ahead of schedule - 2006 in Europe. </p> <p>Analysts expressed concern that a similar vaccine from rival drugs firm Merck might have some of the patents covering the vaccine, although chief executive Dr Jean-Pierre Garnier dismissed the concern and said Glaxo's product is better in a number of ways. </p> <p>Britain's largest drugs firm makes most of its money in the US and the weak dollar has hit sales and profits hard. Its turnover fell 8% to \u00a35bn and pre-tax profit was down 10% to \u00a31.5bn in the third quarter. </p> <p>If the currency effects are taken of out of the equation, pre-tax profits increased 4% and sales were flat. </p> <p>Growth was hampered because three of Glaxo's biggest drugs have lost sales sharply owing to generic competition. The antibiotic Augmentin and the antidepressants Seroxat and Wellbutrin came to the end of their patent lives, so the price has fallen as competitors move in. </p> <p>Growth in the asthma drug Seretide, diabetes treatment Avandia and epilepsy drug Lamictral helped keep sales stable. </p> <p>The firm has trimmed its administration costs but not its sales and promotional costs. The amount spent on research and development has risen due to an increase in the number of clinical trials under way. </p> <p>One of the biggest issues facing Glaxo had been a lack of promising drugs nearing the market, but the firm reported progress for several treatments. \"For me it is very satisfying because it is no longer just a promise,\" Dr Garnier said. \"We are not planting the flag yet but it looks pretty good and it's very nice to see a number of blockbuster opportunities [those with sales potential of more than $1bn]. I can't see a company that would come even close to us in this industry.\" </p> <p>Glaxo has also brought forward the filing date for a compound tagged 115, which treats the side effects of chemotherapy. A new type of drug to treat HIV, called 140, is to be filed in 2007. </p> <p>Drugs that should be filed by the end of next year include Lapatinib, for breast and renal cancer, Trexima, for migraine, and Nelarabine, for a type of leukemia in children. </p> <p>Dr Garnier said that its 381 drug for treating pain is \"still an exciting opportunity\" despite the fact that a member of this class of drugs, Vioxx, was pulled from the market because of bad side effects. He said the increase in heart attacks and strokes might not be an effect of all drugs of this type. </p> <p>The anti-depressant dubbed 162 will be delayed for a year because it has not proved successful at low doses. The firm will begin trials on a higher dose, and will start trials on it as a treatment for obesity, because a lot of the patients lost weight in the depression trials. </p> <p>Yesterday an adviser to the European court of justice said that Glaxo should not have to sell drugs to Greek wholesalers if the products are tagged for other European countries where the price is higher. This was hailed by Dr Garnier as a \"restoration of common sense\".</p>",
  "<p>A warning: Billy Bob Thornton's new film, Bad Santa, is not Miracle on 34th Street. It isn't White Christmas. It isn't The Snowman. No, no. It's the first Christmas movie for people who flat out loathe Christmas.</p> <p>The title says it all: Here, Santa is Bad. He's a criminal, a safebreaker, a thief, masquerading as Saint Nick at a particularly alienating and depressing mall in Phoenix, Arizona, which he and his black elf partner-in-crime (played by a boisterously tiny Tony Cox) plan to rob come Christmas Eve. And he's a drunk. Not of the merely pissed-at-work type, but the unsalvageable-soak variety, sitting in a urine-stained red Santa suit as he dishes out prezzies, and forever looking around him for something to throw up into, or for a windshield to smash with his empties. He's no fan of children, never bothering to moderate his splenetically obscene manner of speaking when they're around. Come to think of it, he's not wild about their parents either, unless he finds a mother of the right bulk who'll permit him to sodomise her in the changing cubicles (and there are takers).</p> <p>This, after all, is Terry Zwigoff's America, and as Bad Santa's star, Billy Bob Thornton, tells me, the director of Crumb and Ghost World \"in a lot of ways, is Bad Santa. It was almost like he was directing a movie about himself. He just doesn't believe in this society. But you know, these days, who does?\"</p> <p>Bad Santa is for those of us who remain sceptical. It is, be warned, a powerfully aggressive, scatological, foul-mouthed and very in-your-face rant against all the rubbishy, tinsel-covered, market-oriented fakery of the holiday season. In the US, it was the biggest comedy hit of last year, and a critical success too. Its backers have geared up their publicity machine all over again to launch the film properly in Britain and Europe at the appropriate seasonal moment.</p> <p>Knowing that Thornton has been dragged out to do the whole junket/round table/media circus rigmarole all over again, I wonder just how happy he'll be after spending a day and a half in an anonymous hotel suite fending off questions about Angelina Jolie from celeb-crazy Euro-hacks. The first sight of him isn't encouraging: He sho' 'nuff didn't spruce himself up this morning. Sitting alone at a small table in a bare room, he's dressed in the sort of sleeveless plaid shirt favoured by the redneck in the roadhouse bar who'll kick your ass just to pass the time. Jailhouse tattoos stain his bare arms, he's sporting a narrow chin-beard, and he's smoking in front of an overflowing ashtray. His greeting is interrupted by an explosive hacking cough, versions of which will recur as deafening percussive pops on my tape recorder.</p> <p>But Billy Bob's a southern boy and that means he's a courtly type, standing up to shake hands and making sure you're comfortable before we proceed. Turns out he's proud to be out pushing Bad Santa all over again, and pleased with its success.</p> <p>\"It's a good one - it's funnier'n shit. I think people wanted to see something they'd actually laugh at, free to be not so constrained in the holiday time, because, you know a lot of people don't even like the holidays. At the end of the day, it's not just a movie that's for shock value, to be cynical. It's got basically the same message as any other Christmas movie does, it's just ...\" and here he issues that wide sneer-cum-beaming smile that's one of his most potent actorly weapons, \"it's just executed differently.\"</p> <p>Billy Bob, like his good friend Bill Clinton, was born in 1955 in Hot Springs, Arkansas, once a wide-open town where the big gangsters of Chicago and the upper midwest came to cool their heels come subpoena-and-grand jury season. It's calmed down a little since its notorious heyday. \"See, gambling was abolished in the late 50s or early 60s,\" he says. \"I was just a little kid when they abolished gambling there but I was old enough to remember people pulling handles and stuff. What they still have there is Oakland Park. Big race track. And they still got the strip joints.\"</p> <p>Thornton is the most visible and talented actor of southern extraction currently working in Hollywood, and where he's from is hugely important and invigorating to him. All his greatest achievements as a writer, director and actor have their roots in and derive their vitality from his strong sense of regional pride. Not that he's a southern chauvinist of the Confederate-poseur variety; he's just anxious to explicate its complexities and its contradictions intelligently, and takes very seriously what he sees as an obligation to depict accurately the place that made him.</p> <p>Is the south a sort of Shadow America, I ask, a parallel universe?</p> <p>\"Yeah. I think it's the soul of the country. I used to do a one-man show and the first thing I'd say was, 'Y'all probably think I grew up screwing my sister. But all the time you're putting us down, remember this: Look around and you see how many presidents were from the south, how many authors we studied in school are from the south, and if you want your heart operated on, you better go to Houston. And you wouldn't have any modern music if it wasn't for the southern half of the United States. So next time you're out there bumpin' your asses together on the dancefloor, remember that if it wasn't for the south you'd be listening to polkas and classical music.'\"</p> <p>Is it galling to be patronised outside the south? \"We get the same shit. For us it's like, what Arkansans are like to people in California is what people from, I dunno, Liverpool are to Londoners. Looked down on as dumb, working-class, not educated.\"</p> <p>One thing he really hates is the way in which non-southern actors seem to overwhelm south-themed movies with godawful Grand Ole Opry accents. Steel Magnolias must have been awful for him to endure. \"Oh, a fuckin' nightmare! But also imagine how I felt when there was an English director, an English actor and Australian actress doing a story of the civil war - filming in Czechoslovakia! I was just like, are you shittin' me?\" He is referring, of course, to Cold Mountain. \"I've never seen it. I won't see it, and simply because if I called folks up in England one day and said, 'Hey, I wanna play Benjamin Disraeli,' they'd tell me I was full of shit and kick me out the door - and they'd be right!\" I notice that his tone doesn't become louder as he warms to his theme; he just calmly triples the number of punctuating expletives. And although he's friends with Anthony Minghella, and likes his other work, he seems determined never to let the film's title sully his lips.</p> <p>\"But let's say they did a movie about the Battle of Britain, and all the guys flying those planes are like, let's say they get me and Gary Sinise and John Malkovich and Robert Duvall, well, there'd be an uproar. But then you get a situation when it's reversed with English directors and actors doin' a movie about the civil war. Goddamn! - I got relatives who died in that fuckin' thing. There's a bunch of southern actors who could have been in that thing and made it so real it would have chilled you to the fuckin' bone. But these days they gotta get whatever's glossy at the time and use it for all it's worth. Plus they shot it in Prague! I mean goddamn, if you wanna see pretty country go to south Carolina!\"</p> <p>A pause, a fresh cigarette, some more blat-blat hacking. \"Oh, I'll probably get in shit for sayin' all this stuff. And I'm off to England on Friday!\"</p> <p>But Hollywood itself is really little better when it comes to southern stories, as Billy Bob explains when he describes the hassles he's had over the last 15 years in trying to finance a biopic of country singer Hank Williams, the original Cadillac cowboy, ur-hillbilly, and a name still uttered with awe south of the Mason-Dixon line.</p> <p>\"We actually pitched it at a major studio, to this lady executive. And she said she didn't really think they were that interested in a baseball movie! And I said. \"I think you may be confusing him with a couple of ball players, Hank Aaron and Ted Williams. Actually, Hank Williams was not only a great country singer, he was the original tragic pop star, and if you're gonna make that story, you have to make the Hank Williams story.\" They'll do it about Jim Morrison, and why the fuck make it about him because Hank Williams lived and died that story years before Jim Morrison, way before. I mean, in the south you wouldn't have these guys without Hank Williams. I dunno. Hopefully we'll get that off the ground some day - and I think the person who should play him is his grandson Hank III. He'd be perfect.\"</p> <p>I suggest that as a southerner in LA, as a Red State kid with a quintessential Blue State job, the cultural divide in America must run right through the centre of Billy Bob's head.</p> <p>\"The politics right now are so messed up here I hardly know what to think. We've had a bad time recently. And America's going to fuck around until the whole world really does hate it. They talk about how people hate it right now, but the potential for how bad we could be hated is really not good, and if we don't watch our ass, we'll lose it altogether.\"</p> <p>As I shake hands to leave, he casts an eye out the wide window of the 15th-floor suite, where grey skies growl all the way to the horizon. \"First rain in 183 days, I heard. I can't get enough of this, can't wait to get to London.\" And then he muses again. \"What's funny about England and its involvement in this Iraq war thing is that we've watched you have the same guy in there with both these presidents. It's like Blair's there with Clinton and then Blair's there with Bush. They always say that England does whatever America does, and a friend of mine joked that Blair even had heart trouble when Clinton had it!\" Always leave 'em smiling: it's a southern thang.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bad Santa is released on November 5. Friday Night Lights is out next year</p>"
