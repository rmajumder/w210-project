  "<p>Players' chief Gordon Taylor has backed the England squad's decision not to talk to the media after last night's 2-1 win in Poland.</p> <p>The chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association said the players acted in response to the treatment dished out to goalkeeper David James after his blunder gifted Austria a point in England's opening World Cup qualifier last Wednesday. James was likened to a donkey in sections of the media.</p> <p>\"There have been personal and vindictive articles about David James in particular,\" said Taylor, \"and nobody more than David accepted that he made a mistake against Austria.</p> <p>\"Criticism is part of life for a professional player, but when you get this sort of derogatory criticism then perhaps this is the only way they can respond as a squad and make a point.\"</p> <p>Taylor said that he doesn't expect the media black-out to continue \"unless that sort of coverage continues\", and added: \"We must remember that players are paid to play not to speak. There's a right to free speech in this country and it's up to you whether to speak or not.\"</p> <p>Taylor also confirmed that he had not been consulted by any of the players about their decision, and added: \"If the media want to be personal and vindictive you cannot blame the victims for wanting to respond.</p> <p>\"It was very disappointing on the eve of such an important match that instead of the coverage being positive and uplifting from the media back home, it was very derogatory and, in some cases, was beyond the pale.\"</p>",
  "<p>Shareholders in former Telegraph boss Conrad Black's Canadian holding company Hollinger Inc have launched a lawsuit against the deposed press baron, his columnist wife Barbara Amiel and other associates including his longtime business partner David Radler.</p> <p>Five investors in Canada - three from Saskatchewan and two from Ontario - are seeking at least \u00a31.7bn to recover market losses suffered by Hollinger Inc since financial scandal engulfed Lord Black's empire.</p> <p>The Tory peer stands accused of taking \u00a3220m out of Chicago-based publishing group Hollinger International, in which Hollinger Inc holds a majority voting stake. </p> <p>A report filed last week by a special committee of Hollinger International's board said he ran a \"corporate kleptocracy\" and claimed he put expenses such as flights, parties and even clothes on the company tab.</p> <p>Hollinger International claimed he needed to take multimillion dollar management fees out of the company to shore up the finances of Hollinger Inc, which has been facing a cash crisis.</p> <p>The Canadian investors believe the drop in Hollinger Inc's share price could have been caused by the allegations against Lord Black and his allies.</p> <p>The 110-page statement of claim filed by the investors accuses Black of pillaging company coffers to finance his lavish lifestyle.</p> <p>\"Lord Black and his acolytes surreptitiously pocketed millions of dollars generated from sales of Hollinger assets - money that belonged to Hollinger - without disclosure to the shareholders,\" the court documents say, according to Canadian reports.</p> <p>And the suit alleges that investors had to pay for Lord Black's \"21,000 sq ft beachfront mansion in Palm Beach, Florida: four-storey home in London's exclusive Kensington enclave...

  "MPs queued up to slap a beaming Ian McCartney on the back when it started to become clear the sole member of \"Little Labour\" had fought off New Labour attempts to depose him from the job he loves. <p>The congratulations for the party chairman in a Westminster bar on Tuesday night underlined why Tony Blair was forced to change his plans.</p> <p>Whatever the strengths of Alan Milburn, Mr McCartney, at 5ft 1ins the shortest male member of the cabinet, is popular with parliamentary colleagues as well as constituency members and trade unionists.</p> <p>The diminutive figure known as \"Big Mac\" is close to John Prescott and the deputy prime minister's support is said to have been as important, if not more so, than that of chancellor Gordon Brown during four days of wranglings.</p> <p>Yet Mr McCartney, a formidable campaigner since he led a paperboys' strike in his teens, also enjoys good relations with Mr Blair and the prime minister is unlikely to have relished the turmoil since it was disclosed that Mr Milburn was lined up for the Scot's job as Labour chairman.</p> <p>Union leaders jumped to the chairman's defence. Mr Prescott left the PM in no doubt about his own position during a conversation described as \"forthright\" by one MP. The premier met Mr McCartney on Monday night as the groundswell of support grew.</p> <p>In an interview published in yesterday's Guardian, Mr McCartney said critics who caricatured him as an \"inarticulate working-class man from Glasgow who ain't that much good\" underestimated his abilities.</p> <p>Sacked from dozens of jobs in his early years, Mr McCartney was often subjected to violence in his pursuit of labour rights before Jack Jones made him, at 21, the Transport and General Workers Union's then youngest organiser.</p> <p>The son of a Scottish MP, he was elected for the Lancashire seat of Makerfield in 1987 and his popularity and ability have ensured that he will retain a seat in the cabinet as Labour chairman until at least the 2005 general election.</p>"
