  "<p>A clash of styles has cost Stefan Angwald his job at Rexam after only five months as the packaging company's chief executive. But he is being allowed to keep his \u00a3800,000 salary and pensions package for the next two years. </p> <p>The world's leading drinks can maker surprised the City yesterday when it announced: \"The board has regrettably concluded that Mr Angwald is not the appropriate individual to lead the company and has therefore asked him to step down.\" </p> <p>Rexam's shares fell 10.5p to 423p, having drifted steadily lower from the 12-month high of 471p achieved a month before Mr Angwald took over as chief executive. He will be replaced by Lars Emilson, a main board director who runs the beverage cans business. </p> <p>Elaborating on the reason for Mr Angwald's departure, a company spokesman said: \"His personal style did not fit the Rexam culture.\" But he would not give any further insight into how Mr Angwald's style was so at odds with the rest of the board. \"It is not right to give the detail. He had the wrong style,\" the spokesman said. </p> <p>The two-year contract that Mr Angwald was given by Rexam was in direct conflict with the Higgs guidance on corporate governance, which recommends 12-month contracts. He will earn more than \u00a315,000 a week in pay and pension benefits for two years or until he finds another job. </p> <p>Rexam also breached the Higgs guidance when it elevated Mr Angwald's predecessor, Rolf Borjesson, to the position of chairman. The guidance cautions against a former chief executive taking over as a company's chairman. Yesterday the company was at pains to stress that Mr Angwald's departure had nothing to do with non-compliance with the Higgs guidance. </p> <p>\"The board recognises the sensitivity of Rolf Borjesson's position with regard to the Higgs guidance on corporate governance,\" said Christopher Clark, Rexam's deputy chairman. \"I would like to emphasise the unanimous nature of the decision that has been taken and the board's full support of Mr Borjesson as chairman of the company.\" </p> <p>When Mr Angwald was selected to succeed Mr Borjesson as chief executive he was described as having \"the right qualities to drive our company forward\". At his previous employer, the consumer goods business SCA Hygiene, Mr Angwald described himself as stubborn and forceful. \"I consider it important to set distinct goals for my employees and myself,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The US has Houston as its oil capital and the UK has Aberdeen. Wherever you go in the town, there are signs of the oil industry that has driven the economy of this town for over 30 years. Trucks drive through the city centre transporting lengths of chain as a thick as a child's arm and piles of steel hawsers: both used in the heavy industrial business of extracting oil from below the seabed. </p> <p>Although the Texans are proud of displaying their wealth with shiny skyscrapers and swaths of swanky suburbs, signs of prosperity are harder to find in Aberdeen. The streets are lined with branches of the Co-op rather than designer names. It may be the fact that Britain's oil reserves are in decline that has resulted in Aberdeen's parsimony. But those involved in the region's oil industry are resolutely upbeat. </p> <p>About 30bn barrels of oil have been pumped from Britain's oil reserves, says Mike Tholen of the UK Offshore Operators' Association. But there remains a further 30bn - so only 50% of the reserves have been exploited. </p> <p>It may seem counter-intuitive, but it is the maturing of the oilfields that is driving the growth of Aberdeen. While the oil majors are not always interested in squeezing the last drop of oil from their fields, there are many smaller operators that specialise in extracting oil from mature fields. </p> <p>\"There are many more players on the market today than there were ten years ago,\" said Jim Atack, managing director of Petrofac - an oil service company. The new players are either US companies who are transferring their expertise of managing mature fields in the Gulf of Mexico to the North Sea or British independent companies . </p> <p>The development of service companies like Petrofac has made it possible for the smaller operators to develop the mature oilfields - known as brownfields, said Mr Atack. \"The smaller operators do not have the necessary manpower to develop the sites alone which is where we service contractors come in.\" </p> <p>Pumping oil is not as easy as simply sinking a well. Crude oil is usually found in a large flat layer of porous rock. Although it is easy to remove the oil around the drill site, extracting more oil from the remainder of the reserve can be tricky. </p> <p>To overcome this problem, oil companies will use other technological tricks, such as horizontal drilling and injecting water or gas to drive more oil out of the rocks. But these techniques are costly. </p> <p>Alex Kemp, professor of petroleum economics at the University of Aberdeen, thinks conventional wisdom on the future of the North Sea is too gloomy. \"Current forecasts underestimate future possible production.\" </p> <p>The main difference between Professor Kemp's estimate and others, is the amount of incremental oil that could be produced - in other words the exploitation of the brownfield sites. </p> <p>With the price of oil having rocketed by 73% since the beginning of this year to over $50 a barrel, this could be seen as a significant incentive for extracting the black stuff. \"Oil companies are used to the price being highly volatile so are very cautious about what price they use to decide where to invest,\" said Mr Atack. </p> <p>The oil community is thought to be using a price of only $20-$25 a barrel to assess where to allocate capital in developing new wells. \"There is a feeling that the supply and demand curve has changed forever and higher oil prices are here to stay,\" said Mr Atack. </p> <p>Higher prices will certainly encourage further development of brownfield sites, since it means that companies' margins will remain healthy despite the higher extraction costs. </p> <p>But a key to the success of the smaller companies is whether they can access the infrastructure of the North Sea. After all, there is little point in extracting gas or oil if there is no way of getting it back on shore. And the oil majors control the infrastructure. \"In the past, negotiations between the smaller oil company and the oil major about access to the pipeline have caused projects to be delayed,\" said Professor Kemp. It is hoped that a new code of practice will put an end to that. </p> <p>In the future, the owner of the asset and the user will negotiate in good faith for six months. If they cannot reach an agreement after that, then the Department of Trade and Industry will be able to intervene and could approve an appropriate tariff. </p> <p>Another initiative which has been welcomed by smaller oil companies is a new licence that gives companies access to parts of the sea floor but at a lower price and for a shorter period of time than traditional licences. The companies will then have a chance to prospect the site and decide whether to develop it. </p> <p>Mr Atack is cheerful about the longer term future of Aberdeen. \"I think the higher oil price and developments in technology will encourage an increasing number of players into the market,\" he said. Developments in subsea technology will make a material difference to oil companies. Connecting oil wells on the seabed and even partially processing the oil will make life easier. </p> <p>Remote monitoring of offshore platforms and the increasing sophistication of the service industry as it matures will also contribute to future growth. </p> <p>The message from Aberdeen is clear - our overall oil reserves may be in permanent decline but there is still plenty of money to be made and no need yet for despondency.</p>",
  "<p>Conrad Black has launched a third libel suit against directors of newspaper publisher Hollinger International Inc, this time over allegations he engaged in a \"pattern of racketeering\". </p> <p>The lawsuit, filed in Canada in June, seeks C$110m (\u00a348m) in damages, Black said in a statement yesterday. Two earlier libel claims made public by Black have sought combined damages of \u00a3860m. </p> <p>The libel suit names Hollinger's interim chief executive Gordon Paris, and directors James Thompson, Richard Burt, Graham Savage and Raymond Seitz. </p> <p>It also names former US securities and exchange commission chairman Richard Breeden, who advised a special Hollinger International committee investigating the company's operations during Black's tenure. </p> <p>Black claims the men brought him \"hatred, ridicule and contempt\" after accusing him of racketeering. </p> <p>The claim stems from a lawsuit the Chicago-based newspaper publisher launched against Black and others seeking \u00a3700m in damages. </p> <p>That lawsuit was amended in May to include charges under a federal racketeering law originally designed to fight organised crime. </p> <p>Black scored a legal victory on Friday when US district court Judge Blanche Manning dismissed the racketeering lawsuit. </p> <p>Hollinger International, which until recently owned the Daily Telegraph, said it was considering appealing against the ruling. A spokesman dismissed the latest libel suit. </p> <p>\"All these libel actions are entirely frivolous attempts to create publicity. Judge Manning's decision on a procedural question has no bearing whatsoever on the truthfulness or accuracy of the underlying allegations,\" he said. </p> <p>Hollinger International fired Black as chairman this year after it discovered what it said were unauthorised payments to him and others.</p>",
  "<p>Lord Hollick, head of media group UBM, is understood to be demanding \u00a31.6m from Richard Desmond following departure of the latter's Express newspaper group from its base on Blackfriars Bridge. </p> <p>The Labour peer wants Mr Desmond to pay for changes made to Ludgate House - affectionately known by newspaper staff as the Grey Lubyanka - following his purchase of the Daily Express and its Sunday sister title four years ago. </p> <p>The financial demand is being vehemently opposed by the former porn publisher, who has had a series of bitter disputes and petty grievances with the owner of the prime Thameside property since he bought the titles. </p> <p>Lord Hollick, who shocked political and media circles when he sold the Express titles to Mr Desmond for \u00a3125m in 2000, agreed to sub-let three floors of the building, or 60,000 sq ft, as part of the deal. </p> <p>As early as 2001, a year after moving in, Mr Desmond was reported to be looking for other premises because of a series of payment disputes, including one over the cost of the post room. </p> <p>He subsequently avoided a potentially damaging legal battle by settling a dispute over an unpaid \u00a3239,000 bill. </p> <p>Further rows erupted over frequently malfunctioning lifts (Lord Hollick used a separate one until last year), the lack of Express titles in the reception area and the removal of the Express name from outside. </p> <p>When the canteen closed at 5.30 and at weekends, to the dismay of newspaper staff who work irregular hours, neither side could agree whose fault it was. </p> <p>The latest dispute comes as Express journalists prepare to follow other sections of Mr Desmond's empire into new premises this weekend. </p> <p>A spokesman for UBM, said yesterday the negotiations over so-called dilapidations were not unusual in property leases. </p> <p>\"The process over the lease is continuing as normal,\" he said. He refused to comment on the scale of the demand made by Lord Hollick. </p> <p>Mr Desmond, who moved into his huge new office at the top of the old HSBC building on Lower Thames Street over a week ago, is understood to believe that Lord Hollick is trying to make him pay for improvements to the building that have not been made for many years. </p> <p>Sources close to Mr Desmond believe that four years of use cannot amount to a \u00a31.6m bill. He declined to comment yesterday. </p> <p>Northern &amp; Shell, Mr Desmond's company, has moved its Dockland staff into the building, which will also house newspaper staff from the Express and Star titles. </p> <p>Lord Hollick is planning to relocate far-flung parts of UBM's empire into Ludgate House, including its PRNewswire. </p> <p>The relationship between the two men has rarely appeared warm. At a speech last year, the former owner of magazines such as Asian Babes and Readers' Wives described his first overtures to the Labour peer. </p> <p>Via an emissary, Lord Hollick politely declined, saying that the self-made millionaire \"wasn't on his radar\".</p>",
  "Let's be honest. If we are not on TV, rapping, running for Britain, or reading the news, most country people don't see a black face like mine from one week to the next (Villages bristle at accusation of rural prejudice, October 9). On the other hand, London gives me the creeps - a lot of black faces, but when the people cleaning the train, emptying bins and mopping up spills in Paddington are always black, I'm saddened, not refreshed. <p>When I reach my hotel, who makes the beds, cleans the loos and wipes the tables? When I get to my meeting, who guards the entrance, staffs reception and restocks the vending machines? And in the meeting (I work in the media), what colour are the delegates I sit next to? White almost every time. In London, there are jobs for whites - and when they've gone, a rainbow of races and faces can then chase after the leftovers. </p> <p>Without contacts, better-than-average qualifications and a lot of bottle, working-class and professional black people know instinctively they're no better off in town or countryside. The countryside is white because racism runs rife right through our society. To call it passive apartheid is a cop-out. <br><b>Joanna Traynor</b> <br>Plymouth</p> <p>The deputy minister for women, Jacqui Smith, misses the point when she dismisses the Commission for Racial Equality's rejection of a single equality body (Legislation soon for new rights body, October 12). The CRE is speaking not for itself, but for Britain's black and minority ethnic communities. And there is no representative black and minority ethnic organisation that supports these proposals. It will mean in practice a downgrading of the CRE's current powers in key areas, including law enforcement, support for casework, applications for injunctions and the power to launch inquiries into named organisations. </p> <p>Jacqui Smith gives the game away when she describes the new body as a \"modern, light-touch regulator\". What about working for the elimination of racial discrimination, promoting equal opportunity and uncovering and proving unlawful racial discrimination? These issues are as vital as ever. <br><b>Diane Abbott MP</b> <br>Lab, Hackney North <br><b>Keith Vaz MP</b> <br>Lab, Leicester East </p>",
  "<p><strong> Athletics</strong></p> <p> Daley Thompson last night emerged as a possible candidate for the role of UK Athletics' performance director for jumps and combined events which has been vacated by Charles van Commenee. </p> <p>The Dutchman had been in contention for the top job as performance director but has taken up a similar role in the Netherlands instead, leaving the field clear for Keith Connor.</p> <p>Connor, head coach of Athletics Australia and a 1984 Olympic triple jump bronze medallist, remains the only known choice for the position to replace Max Jones.</p> <p>Thompson, 46, won the decathlon at the 1980 and 1984 Olympic Games and remains one of the most popular sportsmen in Britain.</p> <p>Connor, meanwhile, may face some adverse publicity even before he takes up his new role after reports in Australia that he was going to lose his job anyway.</p> <p>The Australian Sports Commission began a review of athletics in March. The chief executive and chairman of Athletics Australia have left in a major shake-up and the report, due on Monday, is expected to recommend advertising, and changing the structure of, the role of head coach.</p> <p>Connor, 47, has held the job since 2001 and his contract runs out in December, with Jones due to leave UK Athletics in March.</p> <p>Connor won triple jump gold for England at the Commonwealth Games in 1978 and 1982 and broke the world indoor record with 17.31m in 1981. He remains Britain's third greatest triple jumper, but Thompson still leads the decathlon rankings with his 8,847 points from the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles.</p>"
