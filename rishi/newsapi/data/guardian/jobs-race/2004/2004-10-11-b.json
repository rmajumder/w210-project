  "<p>Keith Connor, the English triple jumper who won gold for Britain in the 1978 and 1982 Commonwealth Games, is set to be named as the performance director of UK Athletics. </p> <p>Connor, 47, who has been head coach of Athletics Australia since March 2001, has emerged as the winner of what became a two-horse race. Earlier yesterday it was revealed that only Charles van Commenee, who coached Denise Lewis to Olympic gold in 2000, remained on the shortlist to contest with Connor the pivotal position in the sport in Britain. </p> <p>Now both seem likely to return to their roots. Van Commenee is set to head back to his native Netherlands to take up a high-ranking position with the Dutch athletics federation. </p> <p>As an athlete, Connor won bronze in the 1984 Olympics, set a world indoor record of 17.31m in 1981 and was ranked No1 in the world with 17.57 in 1982. He remains third on the UK all-time rankings in the discipline, behind Jonathan Edwards and Phillips Idowu. </p> <p>Since his retirement he has established himself as the one of the world's leading coaches. When he moved to Australia he claimed that he had been denied a similar role in Britain because he was \"too feisty\", but his success since then has seen his reputation rise rapidly. In the Commonwealth Games in Manchester in 2002 his team won 28 medals. He also led the Australians in this year's Olympic Games in Athens, where rumours first started to circulate that he was being lined up for a return to Britain. </p> <p>Daley Thompson, the double Olympic decathlon champion, is understood to have applied for the role, which will officially be vacated by Max Jones in March, but the sport was looking for someone with greater coaching experience. Having settled on its chosen candidate, UKA is set to make an official announcement within days. </p> <p>The sport found itself under scrutiny in May when Sir Andrew Foster, the former chief executive of the audit commission, completed a review into athletics commissioned by Sport England and UK Sport. </p> <p>In his findings, he said that the position of performance director \"should be filled through international search. The aim should be to secure the services of the best available person in the world.\" </p> <p>Administrators will be confident that they have achieved that goal. When the position was advertised, applications were received from candidates across the world and David Moorcroft, the chief executive of UKA, said: \"We agree with the Foster report and want the very best available.\" </p> <p>Despite the wide range of applicants, Connor and Van Commenee have always been the favourites. At first it seemed the latter was in the better position, given that he was already working for UKA as technical director for combined events and jumps. He has an outstanding track record, his success with Lewis being followed by a bronze in Athens for his latest protege Kelly Sotherton, and is known for his no-nonsense approach to the sport. But in the end Connor has proved irresistible.</p>",
  "Come that May morning next year there is one issue that will get me to the voting booths and, despite the anger about Iraq, will ensure that I vote Labour: that is the party's pledge to halve child poverty by 2010. Labour has done the easiest bit: it hit the 2004 target and got a million children out of poverty with a working tax credit, child tax credit and increases in the minimum wage. The 2010 target is the one that will really shake up Labour policy big time: this is where it starts to get fun. <p>Labour is not going to spell it out ahead of the next election, but if there is any hope in hell of reaching that 2010 target it will require some serious rethinking of New Labour's approach to benefits and tax increases. If Labour wins the election and sticks to its target, the next term could shape up to be the most radically redistributive government my generation has ever seen - but don't expect any cabinet minister to breathe a word of that to middle England. </p> <p>Ironically, amid all the fondness for radical third-term thinking in the past few weeks, this one really radical policy of New Labour already announced has had little airing. That makes a paper published today by the campaigning thinktank Catalyst, Why Inequality Matters, particularly timely. It points out that while New Labour may have stalled the increase in inequality, it has done nothing to reverse it. The international comparisons are as embarrassing as ever: in purchasing power, the poverty of the poor British child is 11% worse than that of their American counterpart and nearly 30% worse than in France. It's a shocking thing to say, but if you're going to be poor you'd be better off in America. </p> <p>Catalyst's paper unashamedly revives old debates. First, that equal opportunity cannot be used (as New Labour has been wont to do) as a substitute for equality. The two are interlinked: the most egalitarian countries, such as Scandinavia, have the highest rates of social mobility, whereas in the UK this has seized up in recent decades, and opportunity is now effectively determined by the status and wealth of the parents. The idea that the poor, clever kid can succeed looks good, Billy Elliot-style, on the big screen, but it's a myth for all but a minuscule minority. The reality is that talent and education rarely prove enough to propel you out of poverty. </p> <p>Second, Catalyst's paper challenges the legitimacy of a meritocracy: why should the banker be vastly richer than the nurse or street-cleaner? Is it right that market forces are left to determine the price of individuals' labour? Is it right that the individual banker claims as his or her due such a huge share of wealth created by a society that depends on so many other people's less well-rewarded labour? The banker may gamble successfully on the stock market, but whose labour ensures he returns to his desk healthy after his hernia operation? Whose labour ensures that his desk is not buried under a mountain of rubbish and life-threatening mouldy coffee cups on his return? </p> <p>These were the big debates of Labour's 20th century, and the child poverty targets are going to reopen all of them. That's because the next levels of child poverty are not going to be amenable to the interventions the government has used so far. The welfare-to-work principles of the first term are looking pretty shabby. </p> <p>Take the familiar mantra, \"work is the best route out of poverty\": more than half the children in this country living in poverty have a parent in work. For more than a million parents, working has not proved a route out of poverty. Or take another popular mantra, \"work for those who can, support for those who can't\": the latter part of that equation has simply not materialised. Benefits ensure recipients are below poverty levels, cruelly penalising those who can't get into work. Among the poorest households in the UK, lone parents, people with a disability (either child or parent) and ethnic minorities (of which more later) are disproportionately represented. </p> <p>Where New Labour's agendas of welfare to work and equal opportunity have neatly dovetailed is on the expansion of childcare provision. Childcare would help parents into work and, at the same time, improve the child's life chances, runs the logic. Robin Cook, at a conference fringe, went as far as declaring that childcare will be the key to alleviating child poverty. But let's not delude ourselves with false expectations. Childcare may help parents get into work, but not out of poverty, and the claims advanced for it on improved life chances have been inflated. It's hard to see how a private-sector childcare system like the UK's can deliver the social benefits of the Scandinavian state systems. Childcare is not a cheap sticking plaster to cover up sharp economic inequality. </p> <p>And that brings me to the most urgent aspect of the child-poverty agenda. Welfare-to-work and childcare policies have had near-zero impact on Britain's poorest communities. Seventy per cent of Bangladeshi and Pakistani children in this country are living in poverty, a rate which is two-and-a-half times that of white children and well ahead of black Caribbeans (41%). The poverty rates among Bangladeshi and Pakistani children with a working parent are higher than among white children with no working parent. For these ethnic minority families, the promise that work is a route out of poverty has been a cruel deception. </p> <p>Pakistanis and Bangladeshis are worse off than other ethnic minority groups on every indicator of deprivation except for educational achievement - where they get higher results than their poverty would predict, and stay on after 16 in high proportions. The problems are concentrated in certain places, such as Tower Hamlets in east London - home to half of Britain's Bangladeshi community and where more than half of all children are living in poverty - and parts of the Midlands and north-west. Manufacturing decline has crippled the aspirations of the generation of migrant workers who arrived to work in the 1960s. Our economic history betrayed them, and now they find themselves stranded in areas of high unemployment and trapped in cheap housing. </p> <p>This is the most acute part of the child-poverty agenda because the age structure of these communities is one of the youngest in the country - the children now living in poverty will be having their own children over the next two decades. Will they hand on the legacy of deprivation they have themselves inherited? Only their struggle for educational achievement provides any grounds for optimism, and if that fails to reap rewards, by 2010 we could be wringing our hands at the emergence of a radicalised Muslim underclass. Just don't say we didn't see it coming. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Why Inequality Matters by Ben Jackson and Paul Segal is published by Catalyst </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.bunting@theguardian.com\">m.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>"
