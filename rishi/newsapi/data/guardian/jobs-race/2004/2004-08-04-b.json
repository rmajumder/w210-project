  "Britain's most senior openly gay police officer has spoken about his frustrations in his role of deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police. <p>Brian Paddick, who came to prominence for his controversial cannabis experiment in Lambeth in south London in 2001, has told the Guardian that the position he was promoted to in January is a \"bit of a non-job\". </p> <p>In an interview in today's Society Guardian he says he has not made a single decision since taking up the \u00a3118,000-a-year desk job at New Scotland Yard. </p> <p>Mr Paddick is responsible for strategic and business development in territorial policing, which includes responsibility for analysis, planning, strategic change, performance review and all territorial policing policy with the Met. </p> <p>Pressed to explain what the job means in practice, he says: \"I don't understand it. It is a bit of a non-job.\" </p> <p>Asked how he feels doing a \"non-job\", he responds: \"To say I'm bored and frustrated is a pretty accurate interpretation.\" </p> <p>Mr Paddick is renowned for the frankness with which he expresses his often controversial views. When he was the commander of Lambeth he told a radical website, <a href=\"http://www.Urban 75.com\">Urban 75.com</a>, he found the idea of anarchism attractive. \"I'm not controversial for the sake of it,\" he says. \"My opinion is sought and it carries some weight.\" </p> <p>Mr Paddick was forced to leave Lambeth after a former partner alleged he had smoked cannabis at home. </p> <p>He denied the allegations and, after an investigation, no criminal charges were brought by the Crown Prosecution Service. </p> <p>Mr Paddick says it still pains him that he was not reinstated as borough commander, which he describes as his dream job. </p> <p>Instead he was moved sideways and then promoted to one of eight deputy assistant commissioners who work on operational policy. </p> <p>\"There are some good deputy assistant commissioner jobs and some less good ones,\" he says. \"Somebody has to do the less good ones and it's my turn at the moment.\" </p> <p>Asked if his goal was to become the Met commissioner - a position being vacated by Sir John Stevens - he says: \"Maybe it is better not to be at the top of the tree, you are freer to speak out. There are issues that need to be talked about.\" </p> <p>Mr Paddick, 46, who joined the Met in 1976, says he has considered leaving because of homophobic behaviour. </p> <p>\"I have seriously thought about leaving the job at times because sometimes I have been treated inappropriately by line managers,\" he says. </p> <p>Although he says that fewer people in the police service now have problems with colleagues who are gay, he adds: \"There are still some.\" </p> <p>Asked whether the Met has proved to be a genuine meritocracy, he says: \"I've had my concerns from time to time. </p> <p>\"To be a deputy assistant commissioner in the Met with my track record of causing my bosses anxiety from time to time with my public statements is proof of the pudding.\" </p> <p>It was an incident involving an officer in Lewisham, south London, when Mr Paddick was an inspector, that proved a turning point for him. </p> <p>The officer was beaten up by his flatmate - another police officer - after bringing a male friend home. The fact that the officer had been living as a gay man while being an effective law enforcer led Mr Paddick to leave his wife and start a new chapter in his private life. </p> <p>It was almost a decade later, however, before he was prepared to be open about his sexuality at work. Having become a borough commander, he says it was time to \"make a difference\", even if that meant hurting his promotion prospects. </p> <p>\"The police service and society had changed out of all proportion since I'd joined 28 years before. A lot of people had made a lot of sacrifices to help me to be comfortably gay, and it was time I was at the leading edge helping other people.\"</p>",
