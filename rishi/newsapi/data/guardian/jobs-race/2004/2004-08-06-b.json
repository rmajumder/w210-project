  "John Kerry, buffeted by a new assault yesterday on his wartime credentials, has scoured Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 for memorable lines to deploy against President Bush. <p>Although Mr Kerry yesterday unveiled a \u00a316.2bn plan to wean the US off foreign oil, and Mr Bush fended off criticism about July's job creation figures which fell far short of expectations, this is a campaign turning increasingly on which man would make a better commander-in-chief. </p> <p>In that fight, Mr Kerry went to new lengths, borrowing Moore's best lines twice, without crediting the film-maker. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Bush supporters unveiled a full-frontal attack on Mr Kerry, in television ads which argue he did not deserve his combat medals in Vietnam. </p> <p>At a meeting of journalists from ethnic minorities, Mr Kerry drew on a scene from Fahrenheit 9/11, attacking Mr Bush for his seven-minute delay in reacting to news on September 11 2001. \"Had my top aide whispered in my ear, 'America is under attack,' I would have told those kids very politely and nicely that the president of the United States had something he needed to attend to,\" he said, in response to a question. </p> <p>Mr Bush, after learning that a second plane had hit the World Trade Centre, spent the next seven minutes reading My Pet Goat. Moore zoomed in on Mr Bush's darting eyes to suggest he was at a loss as to what he should do. White House aides say Mr Bush continued reading because he did not want to scare the children. </p> <p>Previously, Mr Kerry has steered clear of Moore for fear of alienating swing voters. In turn, Moore has yet to endorse Mr Kerry. The former Republican New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani criticised the tactics, saying John Kerry had to be frustrated \"if he is armchair quarterbacking, based on cues from Michael Moore\". </p> <p>Although Kerry aides insisted he had not seen the film, the Democratic challenger used another of its themes - inappropriately close ties between the Saudi regime and the Bush administration - during his speech to the Democratic con vention. He used that line again this week in St Louis, Missouri, saying: \"I want America's security to depend on America's ingenuity and creativity, not the Saudi royal family.\" </p> <p>The swipe was part of a series of increasingly pointed exchanges between the rivals. </p> <p>In a TV ad aired yesterday a small group of Vietnam veterans said Mr Kerry did not deserve his combat medals. </p> <p>The advert appeared to backfire when Mr Kerry's then-commander retracted the claim. Television stations have hesitated to run the ad, and the Republican senator John McCain, a friend of the Democratic challenger and a Vietnam veteran, has urged the Bush campaign to repudiate the ads.</p>",
  "Scotland Yard has launched an investigation into the promotion of a female officer after senior male detectives complained that she had personally lobbied the Metropolitan police commissioner at an equal opportunities event. <p>The officer at the centre of the row is Detective Superintendent Jill McTigue, whose stint as head of the all-male murder squad in the early 1990s led to comparisons to Helen Mirren's character, DCI Jane Tennison, in ITV's Prime Suspect.</p> <p>Ms McTigue, 53, was among 196 colleagues, mainly male, who applied for promotion this year. She was rejected.</p> <p>The Met said yesterday it would investigate why her name was then added to a list of candidates for promotion when other qualified officers were rejected.</p> <p>She is then said to have buttonholed the commissioner, Sir John Stevens, at a Scotland Yard conference entitled Dancing on the Glass Ceiling: 1,000 Met Women Speak Out for a Change, which was organised to give female officers a chance to air concerns about the Met's alleged \"old boys' network\".</p> <p>Ms McTigue, who was a detective chief inspector at the time, allegedly told Sir John she had been knocked back for fast-track promotion despite her boss highlighting her as an \"exceptional candidate\".</p> <p>The commissioner reportedly promised immediate action. Her name was put forward and she passed the promotion board for the new post.</p> <p>The move angered several male officers, who had also been described as exceptional but who were rejected.</p> <p>\"There is a feeling there is one rule for all of us one day and another for the commissioner another day,\" said a police source. \"It is not right you should get special treatment because you bump into a senior officer in a corridor.</p> <p>A Scotland Yard spokesman said a number of colleagues who had not made a direct appeal to the commissioner, have expressed concern.</p> <p>He said the aggrieved officers were entitled to take the matter to a tribunal.</p>",
  "<p>Frankie Dettori's exceptional run of form continued with winners at Yarmouth and Folkestone yesterday when he moved into the lead in the race for the jockeys' title for the first time this season. </p> <p>Though he is by some distance the most famous jockey riding in Britain, Dettori has been the champion only twice, in 1994 and 1995. </p> <p>Kieren Fallon, who has the considerable power of Sir Michael Stoute's string to support him, remains favourite to win the championship, though if Dettori's golden sequence continues, he will soon be shoulder-to-shoulder at the head of the market. </p> <p>Dettori is also well aware that Godolphin, his main employer, is far stronger this season in terms of numbers than it has been in recent years, and he is clearly enjoying the cut-and-thrust as he makes a serious challenge for the championship for the first time in almost a decade. </p> <p>Coral yesterday cut Dettori to 3-1 from 6-1 for the title, although Fallon remains an odds-on chance at 1-2. Seb Sanders is a 6-1 chance, with Darryll Holland on 10-1. </p> <p>Tomorrow, meanwhile, the Italian will be racing at Ascot, his favourite track, in the Blue Square Shergar Cup, and after yesterday's draw for mounts, he is the clear 11-4 favourite with the sponsors to be the leading jockey on the afternoon. </p> <p>The Shergar Cup has yet to truly capture the imagination of many racing fans, and its team-based structure sits a little uncomfortably with a sport in which punters do not care where a winner is from so long as they have backed it. </p> <p>However, the ongoing battle between Fallon and Dettori - who will be riding, respectively, for the Great Britain &amp; Ireland and the Rest of the World teams - will add extra interest to the card, while there are several less familiar names to grab the attention too. </p> <p>Dettori will have five mounts on Saturday's six-race card, with his best chance possibly coming on Luca Cumani's Starry Lodge in the Shergar Cup Challenge over 12 furlongs. Fallon is the 7-1 third favourite to be the day's top jockey behind Darryll Holland on 6-1. </p> <p>Joining Dettori in the Rest of the World team will be his fellow Italian Dario Vargiu, who has partnered more than 500 winners in his own country but will be making his British debut. Gerald Mosse, Yutaka Take, Damien Oliver and the South African jockey Weichong Marwing, who rode a double on the Dubai World Cup card in March are also due to ride. </p> <p>\"I had my first taste of the track last year when I had a ride in the King's Stand Stakes and it is a beautiful place,\" Marwing said. \"I have got to know a lot of the other riders like Johnny Murtagh, Mick Kinane and Frankie Dettori when we have been riding in Hong Kong, Japan and Dubai together and hopefully they will be kind enough to share a bit of information with me about how to ride the round course.\" </p> <p>It was confirmed yesterday that next year's King George VI And Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes meeting on July 22-24 will be held at Newbury during Ascot's 20-months closure for redevelopment.</p>"
