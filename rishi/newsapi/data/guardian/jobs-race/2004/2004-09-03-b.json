  "UN nuclear inspectors have launched an urgent investigation in South Korea after the government admitted that its scientists enriched uranium close to the level required for an atomic bomb. <p>Coming amid a 22-month nuclear standoff between North Korea and the US, the revelations are likely to heighten fears of a nuclear arms race in north-east Asia. </p> <p>International Atomic Energy Agency investigators arrived in Seoul last weekend to examine a scientific facility where government scientists used lasers to separate isotopes in 0.2g of uranium in early 2000. </p> <p>Diplomatic sources said Seoul had previously blocked access to the facility, that the IAEA had had suspicions about its nuclear activities, and that further alarming discoveries could be expected. </p> <p>\"This is a major event. Very dodgy,\" said an informed diplomatic source. </p> <p>The experiment was reported to the UN nuclear watchdog last Friday as part of South Korea's commitment to a new nuclear safeguard agreement signed this year. </p> <p>The agreement, signed last February, gives the inspectors the right to more intrusive monitoring at short notice. </p> <p>The sources in Vienna believe the South Koreans have \"fessed up\" now only because the more rigorous inspections would have located the highly enriched uranium. Although not bomb-grade, it had been enriched to more than 60%, way beyond the level needed for power stations. </p> <p>According to the science and technology ministry, the experiment was conducted without central government approval. Officials said it was terminated immediately. </p> <p>Diplomatic sources, however, are sceptical of the \"rogue scientists\" explanation. </p> <p>\"The fact that we have decided to report this faithfully and transparently to the IAEA reflects our commitment to nuclear nonproliferation,\" the ministry said. \"We are sincerely honouring our obligations for the peaceful use of nuclear energy and nuclear nonproliferation.\" </p> <p>The enrichment of uranium to this level, however, without being reported for four years, represents a violation of South Korea's obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Diplomatic sources also pointed out that although the volume enriched was small, a reported 0.2g, it is 10 times bigger than the discovery in Iran which triggered the current international dispute. </p> <p>IAEA inspectors have previously been unable to take samples at the site, although sampling is now being carried out, diplomatic sources said. </p> <p>The inspectors are to report their preliminary findings to a meeting of the IAEA board in ten days' time in Vienna. </p> <p>Despite assurances that tests will not be repeated, the news is likely to alarm South Korea's neighbours. </p> <p>It has long played the role of dove in efforts to de-nuclearise the pensinsula. </p> <p>During the military dictatorship of Park Chung-hee in the 1970s, Seoul launched a secret nuclear weapons programme, but the US persuaded it to abandon the plan. </p> <p>North Korea claims it possesses a nuclear deterrent, but it has yet to test a bomb. </p> <p>A new round of nuclear talks among the six powers in the region - China, Russia, Japan, the US and the two Koreas - is expected this month. </p> <p>South Korea will be hoping that its admission will not complicate negotiations which are already bogged down by mutual distrust.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hello there Faye.</strong><br>Hello Small Talk</p> <p><strong>Lovely place, Ashton, isn't it?</strong><br>Mmm. We can just meet up at Highbury next time if you want.</p> <p>[Small Talk mutters something about saying so before the five-hour drive]</p> <p><strong>So... women's football. Coming along nicely?</strong><br>Yeah, it's progressing quite steadily actually.</p> <p><strong>Care to prove it?</strong><br>If you look at the participation figures, we've gone from 60,000 to 80,000 to now over 100,000 women and girls playing in this country. And if we can create enough excitement around Euro 2005, market it right and get it into as many homes as possible, then we can push it on further.</p> <p><strong>Talking of Euro 2005, how do England's chances compare to a fat man trying to outrun a pack of Dobermans?</strong><br>We're all looking forward to it and it's a massive opportunity so you've got to be positive. There's a long way to go, but if we're all fit and injury-free then we can definitely compete with the best. But it'll be tough.</p> <p><strong>Arsenal won the double last season. Can they go one better this year?</strong> <br>We always aim to, and we've definitely proved we're capable, but with the Europeans coming up and the new spread of good players it will be a tougher challenge this season. That's a good thing though - it benefits the league to have competitive games week in, week out, even if it doesn't benefit Arsenal.</p> <p><strong>Are you a supporter as well as a player?</strong><br>After eight years at the club, yes. I work for the club, I play for the club, my life revolves around it so it can't really be helped - even if my family and my boyfriend are Spurs supporters.</p> <p><strong>Well, it has to be someone's lot. You being a girl and all, Small Talk is contractually obliged to ask what level you think you would be on in the men's game.</strong><br>[Looks disdainfully at Small Talk. Small Talk smiles weakly and dons best humble look.] I won't answer that because I don't think it's fair that the women's game is continually compared to the men's.</p> <p><strong>Yes, but, er...</strong><br> It's just going to hold the sport down, and it should be seen as a game in its own right. It might have the same rules but it's different. The two can't compete.</p> <p><strong>Couldn't agree more. Any career highlights you'd like to share?</strong><br>I've been lucky enough to have a few: playing with and captaining England, playing at the European Championship, doing the treble with Arsenal. Probably the best was pulling on an England shirt for the first time.</p> <p><strong>If you weren't a footballer, what would you do?</strong><br>Something working within sport, definitely. I've been a fitness instructor and I'm a qualified masseuse, but I'd like to look at physio or coaching I think.</p> <p><strong>Right, enough of the shop talk, let's get down to the nitty gritty. What's your favourite colour?</strong><br>I should say red, but, erm, it's blue.</p> <p><strong>Your boyfriend will be pleased, anyway. What would you put into Room 101?</strong> <br>[Looks bemused. Small Talk explains.] I don't really hate... I hate these questions, but I don't really have too many hates.</p> <p><strong>A lion asks a tiger outside. Who wins?</strong><br>[Another bemused pause and quick glance at watch.] The tiger. Because I like them.</p> <p><strong>What's your favourite biscuit?</strong><br>Biscuit? Probably a chocolate digestive, but I try not to eat too many of them because I love biscuits and they're my downfall. </p> <p><strong>Bit strong isn't it? A heavy gambling addiction on a small salary is a downfall. Chocolate diges...</strong><br>I'm eating ginger nuts at the moment because they're better for me so I don't feel so guilty. Sometimes I eat three at a time, but I'm cutting back and I'm doing all right.</p> <p><strong>We're pretty sure there are patches for it, don't worry. Last CD you added to your collection?</strong><br>Anastasia's new one. [Small Talk emits a long, slow groan. Much like the album.] It's good actually, I've got a couple of her albums, and I like her latest single.</p> <p><strong>Cheese or chocolate?</strong><br>Chocolate. I don't eat that much of it, but I'm not too keen on cheese. I like Milky Ways. And Fudge.</p> <p><strong>Just enough for a treat, eh? What do you always set the video for?</strong><br> [Without pausing for breath.] Friends. I don't watch a lot of telly, and when I do it's normally sport, but if I wasn't going out on a Friday night I used to watch it or sometimes the repeats in the mornings. I'm sad it's gone.</p> <p><strong>You'll be watching Five's Joey then?</strong><br> Yeah I might, but he wasn't one of my favourite characters. I liked Phoebe and Rachel.</p> <p><strong>Those Friday nights... what's your poison?</strong><br> I'm not a big drinker. All the girls take the mickey out of me because one glass of wine and I'm over. I'm a cheap night out.</p> <p><strong>Nowt wrong with that. Timberlake or Pi- </strong><br>Brad Pitt. He's just lovely. He's more mature and he's got something about him.</p> <p><strong>It's customary at this point in proceedings for us to ask where you're off to, but as there's a lady outside loitering with some make-up and a camera...</strong><br> Yeah, I'm promoting some training kit designed for women by Footie Chick. </p> <p><strong>We'll wrap it up there then Faye, thanks very much.</strong><br>Thanks Small Talk. See you a bit nearer to home next time.</p> <p><em>Faye White didn't do this for the plug, but you can see her modelling Footie Chick's gear</em> <a href=\"http://www.footiechick.com\">here</a>.</p>"
