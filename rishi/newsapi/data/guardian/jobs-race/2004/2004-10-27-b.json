  "The first units of a Black Watch battlegroup are due to arrive today in their new positions south of Baghdad as Tony Blair indicated that more British troops may replace them in the American-controlled zone before the end of the year. <p>In the most controversial deployment of British troops since the invasion of Iraq, the battlegroup is expected to be based near the town of Iskandariya in a volatile mixed Sunni-Shia region in Iraq's so-called \"triangle of death\". </p> <p>They are replacing US marines who are being deployed northwest to reinforce American troops surrounding Falluja, which has been attacked for months by US armour and aircraft with no sign of a military victory. </p> <p>The 850-strong battlegroup will be under overall US control but under the operational command of British officers. The soldiers will operate under British rules of engagement. </p> <p>Mr Blair yesterday repeated to MPs that the Black Watch battalion of around 500 troops will be home by Christmas. However, he indicated, as did the chief of defence staff, General Sir Michael Walker, last week, that other British troops may be needed to replace them. </p> <p>\"We don't believe there will be a further requirement for other troops,\" he told Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat leader, in the Commons. </p> <p>The prime minister continued: \"But I can't commit myself, I can't guarantee that because I obviously don't know the situation that may arise. What I do know is that if there is any contingency ... we are able to meet it\". </p> <p>Mr Blair said he had not been given an assurance, nor had he sought one from Washington, that when the Black Watch was withdrawn they would be replaced by American, rather than British, troops. </p> <p>Critics of the deployment say its timing is political, enabling the Bush administration to say, in the run-up to the US presidential elections, that America is not alone in Iraq in the fight against insurgents, foreign fighters and terrorists. </p> <p>Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, told MPs last week that US forces in Iraq needed the help of an experienced and well-trained British battlegroup. </p> <p>Of the 130,000 American troops in Iraq, fewer than a third had the \"requisite combat capability\", said Mr Hoon. The Pentagon announced on Tuesday that it was sending more troops to Iraq in the run-up to elections there in January. </p> <p>An ICM survey of 1,001 adults for the Guardian, reported in yesterday's newspaper, found that 61% disapproved of the decision to send the Black Watch in support of US operations against 30% who approved. 55% of Labour voters opposed the decision, the survey showed. </p> <p>The British battlegroup will be operating in an important supply route, including strategic bridges, where US convoys have been regularly attacked by insurgents in fatal incidents leading to the deaths of US soldiers and Iraqis. </p> <p>The British \"softly, softly\" approach to try to influence \"hearts and minds\" will face a tough test in an area widely seen as posing a greater threat than the Shia-dominated, British-controlled southern region around Basra. </p> <p>The British military convoy engaged in what the Ministry of Defence has called Operation Bracken moved north west from Basra yesterday in small groups to evade ambushes. They were accompanied by US marines, and Lynx helicopters flew above. </p> <p>The Black Watch battalion is equipped with 50 Warrior armoured troop carriers. They will be supported by a reconnaissance unit from the largely Welsh Queen's Dragoon Guards, with around 100 men and 12 Scimitar armoured fighting vehicles, and a 50-strong Royal Marine light infantry unit from 40 Commando. </p> <p>There will also be support troops including engineers, logisticians, signallers, medics and nurses. </p> <p>The Black Watch commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel James Cowan, said yesterday that the troops had left Basra heading for the north of Hilla, about 60 miles south of Baghdad. That could be a transit base.</p>",
  "<p>Rangers gave the Premier League title race a much-needed boost last night when they cut Celtic's lead at the top to four points although they made hard work of beating lowly Dunfermline. </p> <p>Alex McLeish's side were a goal down at the break but perhaps spurred on by news from Parkhead, where Celtic were also losing at the interval, they picked up their game after the interval. </p> <p>Rangers had no margin for error after only drawing with Dundee United at Ibrox on Sunday. They made one change with Hamed Namouchi replacing Shota Arveladze. </p> <p>Dunfermline, lying three places from the botttom of the Scottish Premier league, kept the side which defeated Dundee at dens Park. </p> <p>Stefan Klos was the busier of the two keepers, comfortably saving from Simon Donnelly and watching Craig Brewster's header bounce wide. </p> <p>There was a narrow escape for Rangers in the 10th minute when Greg Shields burst forward and laid the ball back for the former Rangers' player Barry Nicholson but he drove over. </p> <p>The alarm bells were ringing for Rangers and in the 22nd minute Brewster gace Dunferlione a deserved lead in spectacular style. Shields played the ball swiftly forward to Nicholson, who set up Brewster with an instant backheel and the veteran curled the ball past Klos from 20 yards. </p> <p>Stung by the goal Rangers almost equalised immediately but Novo's header was palmed away by the back-pedalling Derek Stillie. </p> <p>The Dunfermline keeper was then relieved to see the ball go out for a goalkick after he had hit a clearance straight at Novo. At the other end Klos smothered a low drive from Tom Butler. </p> <p>A minute before the interval Dado Prso won a corner in the 44th minute and, after Marvin Andrews had a shot blocked, the Croatian striker followed up but his effort was blocked by Scott Wilson. </p> <p>However, within two minutes of the restart Rangers were level when Jean-Alain Boumsong, who said before the game how much he disliked Dunfermline's plastic pitch, headed home Fernando Ricksen's free-kick from six yards out. </p> <p>Rangers pressed forward in search of the lead and Novo, fed by Ricksen, cut in from the left baeting Shields and sent in a low drive which Stillie touched on to his right-hand post. </p> <p>Stillie then had to be quick off his line to cut out a dangerous pass by Robert Malcolm aimed at Prso and seconds later Rangers were awarded a penalty. </p> <p>A long pass from Gregory Vignal was deflected by Prso into Ricksen's path and as the Dutchman shaped to shoot he was chopped down by Andrius Skerla. Although Ricksen was clearly the Lithuanian was not booked - but Novo punished the offence when he converted the penalty after 57 minutes for what turned out to be the winner. </p> <p>Skerla made some amends with a sliding tackle that denied Prso, who showed his lack of pace by being caught up after being put clean through. </p> <p>Prso had a great chance to extend Rangers but Stillie produced a superb save to keep a his header out. </p>",

  "Prime Minister Tony Blair today reiterated his promise that the Black Watch \"will be home for Christmas\" as the British army announced that some 800 troops have begun their deployment north towards Baghdad from their base in southern Iraq. <p>Lieutenant-Colonel James Cowan said the troops, accompanied by 40 US marines, had left the southern city of Basra to head for a base in Hilla, about 60 miles south of Baghdad. \"British forces have just started moving this morning into the north of Hilla. They will deploy in that area and will receive their jobs in maintaining security there,\" he said. </p> <p>The government gave the go-ahead last week for an 850-strong battle group led by the Black Watch to deploy north of their base around Basra. They will replace US troops who are expected to take part in offensives against insurgent strongholds west and north of the capital. The move is part of a coalition effort to bring order to Iraq before elections in January. </p> <p>The American military wants the British to assume security responsibility in areas close to Baghdad, to enable US marines and soldiers to be moved to insurgency strongholds west of the capital, including Falluja.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: \"This is the commencement of the deployment of the Black Watch battle group.\" The MoD gave no further details of today's movements but reports said around 50 vehicles were on the move. They are heading to an area regarded as far more dangerous than the region they have so far been operating in. </p> <p>Asked about the deployment at prime minister's question time, Tony Blair repeated his promise that the Black Watch would be home by Christmas. He added that he did not believe that further British troops would be needed to replace them in central Iraq, though he could not guarantee that. </p> <p>Challenged by the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, about whether the Black Watch would be replaced by US troops, Mr Blair said he had neither been given nor sought assurances that further deployments would come from America. The chief of the defence staff, General Sir Michael Walker, has said they may need to be replaced by other troops from the multinational force.</p> <p>The deployment starts as a Guardian/ICM survey today shows overwhelming opposition to the move. The poll of 1,001 adults for found that 61% disapproved of the decision, while 30% approved. Even among Labour supporters, 55% were against the deployment, with 40% in favour. Despite that, overall opposition to the war has fallen, with 46% saying they thought the invasion was unjustified, a drop of 10 points since July.</p> <p>In other developments, a Japanese national was the latest hostage to be taken by militants with a video posted on an Islamic website in the name of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's group. </p> <p>The group threatened to behead him within 48 hours unless Japan pulls its troops from Iraq, a request which was rejected by Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi. The hostage, Shosei Koda, 24, was a \"private individual\" with no connection to the Japanese government or armed forces, foreign minister Nobutaka Michimura stressed.</p> <p>Meanwhile, there was no more news on the kidnapped aid worker Margaret Hassan, who went missing in Baghdad eight days ago. Ms Hassan, director for Care International in Iraq, was snatched at gunpoint by an as-yet-unidentified group. </p> <p>Ms Hassan, who has British and Iraqi nationality, was born in Dublin and has lived in Iraq for about 30 years. She was seen in a harrowing broadcast last Friday begging for her life. She urged Mr Blair not to send troops to Baghdad and warned she could meet the same fate as the murdered British hostage Kenneth Bigley.</p>",
  "<b> On the road</b> <br> <p><b> In the run-up to polling day, <b> Gary Younge </b> is driving the 2,147 miles from John Kerry's base in Boston, Massachusetts to George Bush's home town of Midland, Texas. Today he reaches Bill Clinton's old home state, Arkansas </b><br> </p> <p> Route 65 dips, rises and swings through the Ozark mountains, past rib shacks offering hickory hams and small stores emblazoned with the confederate flag. \"The past is never dead,\" wrote Mississippi's famous son, William Faulkner, of the south. \"It's not even past.\" </p> <p>And so it is as you pass through the whitest part of Arkansas, a former confederate state, where some residents openly embrace the lost cause to defend a discredited institution - slavery - almost 150 years after it was defeated.</p> <p>Arriving in Little Rock the sun is high and the air is humid. This is the deep south, where salad comes with fried chicken and race comes with everything: it remains the single most consistent indicator of where you live, whom you date, what TV programmes you watch, where you pray and, not least, how you vote.</p> <p>In his office at the state's Democratic party headquarters, Rodney Shelton, who is responsible for outreach to black voters, shows me two maps of Arkansas. One indicates the breakdown of the vote in 2000, with the heavily Democratic areas shaded in progressively darker tones; the other reveals the breakdown of the state by race, coloured in the same way. The patterns are virtually identical - the darker the shade on the map indicating Democrat support, the darker the people who live there.</p> <p>\"The black vote is absolutely critical to the Democratic vote,\" says Mr Shelton. \"We just can't win without it.\"</p> <p>What is true for Arkansas is equally true for the whole country. The Democrats have won only one election since the second world war (in 1964) without the black vote. African Americans make up more than 10% of voters in a third of the crucial battleground states, including Ohio, Florida and Michigan. Yet a recent poll by the Joint Centre for Political and Economic Studies shows that while black Americans have an incredibly low opinion of George Bush - giving him just a 22% approval rating - they have yet to warm to the Democratic challenger, John Kerry. In 2000 the Democratic nominee, Al Gore, got 80% of the black vote to Mr Bush's 9%. This year, the centre's polling shows Mr Kerry on just 68% while the president has doubled his share to 18%.</p> <p>\"This poll is showing a certain amount of black ambivalence in terms of election year issues that resonate within the community, and their relationship with Senator Kerry,\" said Eddie N Williams, the president of the centre. \"They have not yet embraced Senator Kerry to the extent that they did former president Bill Clinton and former vice president Gore.\"</p> <p>Of one of the central planks of Mr Bush's agenda, the war on terror, Hank Wilkins, 22, an African American, said: \"Black Americans have a history of being terrorised in America, so the idea that we could be attacked in our own country was not something new to us.\"</p> <p>The other plank, the war in Iraq, plays badly with most. \"The domestic issues and the foreign policy issues are inter-twined,\" said Vivien Flowers, 35. \"If you look at who's fighting out there it's the folks who don't have jobs or healthcare who joined the army. They were sent for a reason and that reason no longer exists.\"</p> <p>Added to this is the way Mr Bush gained office: the debacle in Florida when a disproportionate number of African American voters were either turned away at the polls or had their votes discounted.</p> <p>\"A lot of people feel that Mr Bush did not win the 2000 election and a huge number of black voters were disenfranchised in Florida,\" said Dale Charles, the chapter president of Little Rock's National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, the country's oldest civil rights organisation.</p> <p>The joint centre's poll shows that 63% of black Americans are concerned that their vote might not be even be counted next Tuesday. It was an issue Mr Gore stressed on Sunday as he visited black churches in Florida, his presence searing the experience of 2000 into the minds of black voters in the hope that it would galvanise them next week. \"If any of you felt frustrated or angry about what was done four years ago, I want to encourage you not to ignore those feelings,\" he said. \"Don't turn it into angry actions. Love thy neighbour. But vote for your future.\"</p> <p>When it comes to black America in general and Arkansas in particular, Mr Kerry's greatest strength seems to be that he is not Mr Bush; his greatest weakness is that he is not Mr Clinton, who hails from Arkansas.</p> <p>\"I think we were spoiled with Bill Clinton,\" said Mr Charles. The former president's easy personality and southern ways made him a hit with African Americans, the Nobel laureate Toni Morrison once famously describing him as \"our first black president\". Mr Charles added: \"People are picturing someone coming close, so that's tough on Kerry because I don't see any candidate measuring close.\"</p> <p>Mr Clinton's heart condition has kept him away from the campaign trail in the past six weeks. Now he has sufficiently recovered, black Arkansans are hoping he will head home soon to work his magic.</p> <p>Republicans, meanwhile, have been out plying their socially conservative message, leafleting cars outside black churches, reminding voters of their positions on abortion and gay marriage, on which there will be a referendum on polling day. In a community where the church remains the single most powerful mobilising force, their strategy has had some traction but not enough to erase the impression that Republicans stand for the white and the wealthy.</p> <p>\"I know same-sex marriage is totally against the world of God, and I think John Kerry supports it,\" said John Nunn, at his soul-food restaurant near Marvell in the Mississippi Delta. \"But I'm voting Democrat for sure. I don't think Republicans have a clue about poor people.\"</p> <p>When the Democrat president Lyndon Johnson signed the civil rights act in 1964 he told an aide: \"We have lost the south for a generation.\" Forty years on it looks as if they may have lost it for ever.</p> <p>The political realignment of the south and racial realignment of the Democratic party is now virtually complete.</p> <p>The Democrats once dominated the south through their most loyal base, white racists. Now African Americans form the bedrock of their support. Meanwhile Republicans saw an opening by concentrating on the racial fears of whites, post civil rights, in what has become known as Richard Nixon's \"southern strategy\".</p> <p>Now the south is staunchly Republican. Integration of the races has brought about the segregation of the parties - southern whites vote overwhelmingly Republican; most blacks vote Democrat. With the exception of Florida, Arkansas remains the last southern state where the Democrats stand a chance. In 2000, Mr Bush won it by 51% to 46%; the latest poll this year puts the parties even, each on 48%.</p> <p>With six electoral votes at stake in such a close race you would think this would make it a much sought after prize. Other states with fewer votes - Nevada, New Mexico, New Hampshire - are showered with visits and bombarded with ads. But, to the dismay of local Democrats, Mr Kerry has not been here since May. Television ads are few and far between; the yard signs and badges are more scarce. Meanwhile Republican field officers have gone to Colorado, where Mr Kerry is making a strong challenge.</p> <p>\"Arkansas has been devalued,\" said one Democrat insider. \"I think they've given up on the south and that means we're carrying the south on our backs.\"</p> <p>But neither side has pulled out entirely. The Republicans remain a presence with automated phone calls, some ads and local volunteers. The Democrats have several field officers from out of town. \"It's man versus machine,\" said Mr Shelton.</p> <p>In one of the many states where early voting has begun, the scene from the Dunbar community centre last week suggested that it was human endeavour that was winning through. Old, black women in church hats were ferried to the centre two or three at a time; they trooped in and emerged with stickers on their jackets announcing \"I've voted\".</p> <p>As is the case in the rest of the country, most of those who have voted early are in heavily Democratic areas. \"We're dominating the ground game,\" said Mr Shelton. \"And that's where it's going to count.\"</p> <p><b> theguardian.com/uselections2004</b><br></p>",
  "<p>Ethnic minority households living in rural areas can experience isolation, and may even suffer from racist language and violence as a result of white communities' fear of the unknown and unfamiliar, according to a new report published today.</p> <p>The study by the University of Leicester depicts a countryside worlds away from the cosy imagery with which it is typically associated and echoes claims made recently by the Commission for Racial Equality chairman, Trevor Phillips, that it is a place \"in which people from ethnic minorities feel uncomfortable\". </p> <p>Key concerns in the report, Rural Racism, include the 'invisibility' of racist crimes, which tend to go unnoticed by rural agencies, authorities and policy-makers. There was a lack of consideration given to the growing number of ethnic minority rural inhabitants and visitors, it suggested.</p> <p>As well as charting the different forms rural racism can take the editors of the report also compiled ways in which harassment can be tackled. </p> <p>Research conducted in Suffolk outlined how a particular racial harassment initiative had helped to tackle prejudice in the area and the study said this work might be applied in other rural districts.</p> <p>The report also suggested introducing elements of diversity and multiculturalism into classrooms, an initiative which has been shown to be a particularly effective way of confronting prejudices amongst schoolchildren in largely white, rural areas. </p> <p>Neil Chakraborti, lecturer in criminology and co-editor of the report, said: \"We have found disturbing levels of racial prejudice and victimisation in various rural environments, and yet have encountered complacency amongst many policy makers and stakeholders in rural affairs who remain reluctant to even acknowledge the existence of racism.\"</p> <p>The research also explodes the long-held assumption that racism is largely a problem confined to urban locations and underlines it as an issue which has serious implications for ethnic minorities and policy makers.</p> <p>Jon Garland, co-editor of the report, said: \"Rural Racism seeks to highlight key issues, concerns and preventative strategies that are belatedly receiving recognition at a local and national level. In putting together this book, it is our sincere hope that we can raise awareness of issues that have, to date, received far too little attention.\"</p>",
  "There is overwhelming public opposition to the government's decision to move the 850 British troops and support staff of the Black Watch to support US operations north of their usual Iraqi base in Basra. <p>The results of this month's Guardian/ICM poll show that even a majority of Labour voters - 55% - are opposed to the decision, a finding which is likely to fuel criticism from Labour backbenchers. </p> <p>But the poll also shows that anti-war sentiment in Britain has slumped by 11 points since it recorded a record high of 56% in July. Public opinion remains deeply divided over whether the war against Iraq was justified with 43% saying it was necessary and 46% believing it was unjustified. </p> <p>The continuing turbulence faced by the government over the war and by the more recent row over gambling, however, has failed to dent Labour's prospects for a third term. The poll shows Labour's lead has stretched to six points this month, with the anti-Europe UK Independence party continuing to eat away at the Tories' core support. </p> <p>The poll shows that 61% of the public say they oppose the decision to redeploy the First Battalion of the Black Watch. Only 30% say they approve. </p> <p>Tony Blair has particularly failed to get his case to women voters on this issue. Women have been far more strongly anti-war than men and only 22% approve of his decision to agree to the US request. </p> <p>This is borne out in the responses to the Guardian/ICM war tracker question which asks voters whether or not they think the war to remove Saddam Hussein was justified. Only 39% of women say it was compared with 47% of men. </p> <p>Opposition to the war is strongest among Liberal Democrats at 62%. A majority - 52% - of Tory voters also oppose it. But among Labour voters opinion is split two to one in the other direction with 59% saying they approved of the war and only 32% agreeing that it was unjustified. </p> <p>The continuing support for the war among Labour voters is a big factor in the party's dominance in voting intentions. If there was a general election tomorrow, 37% say they would vote Labour - up one point since last month. </p> <p>This is six points ahead of the Tories who have fallen from 33% to 32% in the last month with the Lib Dems consolidating their position on 23%. These figures would be enough to give Labour a third term in government with a majority of more than 100 seats. </p> <p>The continual erosion of the Tory position - down from 35% share of the vote on the Guardian/ICM poll in March to only 31% - is matched by the rise of Ukip's share which reached 4% this month. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,001 adults aged 18 and over by telephone between October 22 and 24 2004. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.</p>"
