  "<p>I have worn no make-up for a week. Not a scrap. No face powder, no mascara, no blusher. Nothing, apart from lip balm, which in my book is medicinal, so doesn't count. </p> <p>Don't get me wrong, the no make-up thing wasn't me taking a stand, nor was it intentional. I went to a music festival for the weekend, packed my usual bucketful of toiletries forgetting I would have to lug the darn things from the car park to the camp site, and ended up with more than I could carry. On the return journey, a friend took pity on me and offered to take my excess baggage with her. As she was leaving early, this meant I'd have to pick up my stuff, make-up bag included, from her house at a later date. Monday turned into Tuesday, which turned into Wednesday and, before I knew it, a whole week had passed, sans make-up bag. </p> <p>Normally, this wouldn't be a problem: at the last count I have three make-up bags, a bathroom tidy full of overspill and a desk drawer that could rival Selfridges' beauty hall. Except that I'd just had a clear-out, both at home and work. As a result, all that was left was my bare essentials and proper \"going out\" make-up - and not even I wear bright green eye shadow to the office. </p> <p>Yes, I know I could have gone out and restocked, but it seemed pointless. Besides, I'm not so vain that I can't be seen without my \"face\", such as it is. Except, of course, I am - so I spent the week fretting about the shininess of my skin, the thinness of my eyelashes and the lack of definition of my cheekbones. </p> <p>But you know what? Friends have not taken me to one side and asked me quietly what's wrong, I have not been refused entry to any establishment and children have not run screaming at the sight of my naked face. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say that not a single person seems to have noticed the difference. But none of this matters, because the truth, of which it is easy to lose sight, is that I wear make-up because I love it, and I wear it for me, not them.</p>",
  "The Olympic games engages virtually everyone on the planet. The past two weeks have shown they are thrilling, intoxicating and enriching - and, of course, unpredictable. <p>Those who claim the games are just a batch of simultaneous world championships simply don't get it. There is a magic about the Olympic games that transcends everything else in sport. It is the greatest show on earth. And this year they returned to Greece - the home of the Olympics, which was an amazing setting. </p> <p>I am told there are more than 10,000 British fans here. We have the Barmy Army at the boxing, the eventing looks like the final day at badminton, the solid mass of Union Jacks at the rowing were amazing to behold, and I know the stadium tonight will be a sea of red while and blue as Kelly Holmes goes for the double gold. </p> <p>It has made me and my team even more resolute in our efforts to win the 2012 Olympics for our sports-mad nation. Being in Athens and seeing these fans makes it easy for me to imagine the welcome we would give the world's athletes as they come to compete in London. </p> <p>As chairman of London's bid to host the Olympics and Paralympics in 2012, I am heavily involved in a campaign that is demanding, exciting and endlessly fascinating. And, of course, for a former Olympic athlete there is nothing to match the simple elemental thrill of planning your race. And this is a chase like no other; it is winner take all and there are no medals for second or third. </p> <p>As an athlete you become adept at reading the signals from your body and mind and there are times when you feel a kind of overwhelming calmness that you can win. </p> <p>I am convinced more than ever that we have the vision, the passion and the expertise to deliver the greatest games, not only for London, but for the entire country. </p> <p>My team is now finalising all the details - from competition venues to the best-ever transport plan - ready for submission to the International Olympic Committee in November. We have had a wonderful opportunity to evaluate our plans with a behind-the-scenes look at a real games situation. We have looked in depth at security, transport, venues, and day-to-day operation of a games, and have learned much. </p> <p>Despite the gloomy predictions Athens has delivered a very good Olympics in state-of-the-art facilities against stunning backgrounds. Venues have been excellent, as has the athletes' village. The transport has worked well and the crowds have been building towards sell-out. </p> <p>The games have made a lasting impression on Athens, helping to improve the city's infrastructure and providing new sports facilities for the future. The delivery of the games and the world's media attention has rightly been a source of tremendous pride for the people of Greece. </p> <p>It is now our time to thank Athens for carrying the Olympic spirit forward strongly and proudly. Success breeds success - hosting the Olympic games can be a real force for positive change. </p> <p>And we will deliver a games in London which will increase the participation in sport, improve investment in our sporting facilities and leave a fantastic legacy for generations to come. </p> <p>Lord Coe is a double Olympic gold medallist and chairman of London 2012</p>"
