  "<p>The Salvation Army, well-known for its brass bands, archaic military style uniforms and soup kitchens, today warned that staff may be made redundant as part of plans to tackle a \u00a310m budget deficit.</p> <p>The news of the deficit emerged in a letter sent to staff outlining the financial situation. Redundancies could not be ruled out, but would be \"a last resort\", the charity said.</p> <p>The 126-year-old Christian charity, which now provides a variety of services for homeless people, elderly people, families and substance abusers, emphasised that any cuts would be made from administrative staff, with no job losses affecting its social work.</p> <p>Last year, the army's income was \u00a3185m, but a spokeswoman said a mid-term review had revealed that targets for fundraising would not be met. The charity was making cuts now in a bid to wipe out the \u00a39.6m projected deficit before the end of the financial year.</p> <p>She said some areas of income were falling, such as unrestricted legacy income. Although legacies were increasing overall, many of these were tied to particular activities.</p> <p>Other areas of fundraising had \"probably reached a ceiling\" because of the charity's strategy of relying on low-risk methods with a high yield. The army was unwilling to move into higher-risk strategies, which it felt would be unpopular with the public.</p> <p>The charity's costs are also increasing year on year, with many services based in old Victorian buildings with substantial refurbishment and maintenance bills. Other services were also running at a deficit because they did not raise the amount of income to fund the level of service the army believed its clients needed, the spokeswoman said.</p> <p>The Salvation Army's membership - now some 60,000 strong - has also been in steady decline since a highpoint in the 1930s. With a loss of between 500 to 1,000 members a year, subsequently the army is also losing out on income that members pay in tithes, when they commit in advance a certain amount of their income to the charity. The current tithe income is worth about \u00a320m a year.</p> <p>The army's new leader, commissioner Shaw Clifton, highlighted the problem of falling membership when he took office in June, pledging: \"We will spend much time over the coming months visiting Salvation Army churches across the UK and Republic of Ireland to see how ministry and membership can be encouraged.\"</p> <p>The charity has also tried to modernise its image, with less use of the traditional military terminology and updated uniforms.</p> <p>The savings needed to balance the budget were \"significant\", the spokeswoman added and \"all options\" were being considered, including selling off property. But the she stressed that money raised in the annual fundraising appeal, which began on Saturday, would not be used to plug the budget gap.</p> <p>The spokeswoman said: \"We can assure the public that every pound raised in our current annual appeal goes directly to fund our social work, which supports some of the most vulnerable people in society.\"</p> <p>The charity has hit financial trouble before. In the early 1990s, it ran into difficulties and launched a restructuring after falling victim to a \u00a36m bogus investment racket.</p>",
  "Government targets are forcing job centre advisers to spend their time on unemployed people who could just as easily find jobs themselves, the Liberal Democrat conference heard today. <p>The Lib Dems' work and disability spokesman, Paul Holmes, made the accusation as he unveiled the party's proposals to scrap the New Deal, the government's welfare to work scheme. </p> <p>He said the scheme was skewing priorities away from those who find it hardest to access the job market, particularly the disabled and the over-50s.</p> <p>The Lib Dems would replace the scheme, which offered \"the least help to the most needy\", with \"individual work schemes\" to provide tailored support, he said.</p> <p>\"Job Centre Plus Personal Advisers in different parts of the country have told me that the tick-box culture means that the 'job-ready' are given priority so that centrally imposed government targets can appear to be met - while the hard-to-place fail to get the support they need,\" he told the conference. </p> <p>The New Deal was introduced by government in April 1998 to help under-25s get into work through a mix of interviews and benefit sanctions for those who refused available work. </p> <p>Two months later, a similar deal for over-25s was introduced. Earlier this summer, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, announced a \"shake-up\" of the scheme, including more tailored training and support according to individual needs, the threat of tougher and more frequent job centre interviews and a review of possible sanctions.</p> <p>While Job Centre Plus should remain the \"gateway\" for those seeking job and benefit advice, Mr Holmes said the funding freed up from abolishing the New Deal would be used to provide individual work schemes.</p> <p>Job centre staff would be given greater flexibility to design individual programmes for those experiencing the greatest difficulties in finding employment, and New Deal sanctions would be replaced by incentives, though these have yet to be sketched out.</p> <p>Mr Holmes told the conference: \"As a nation we cannot afford to continue to ignore the plight of those who face the greatest difficulty in gaining work, including the 1.2 million disabled people who want to work. It is unjust to them, and, with an ageing population profile, it is an appalling waste of the nation's human capital.\"</p>"
