  "<p>The field for Sunday's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe took shape when 27 horses stood their ground at yesterday's first forfeit stage. The most notable absentee was, as widely anticipated, Sulamani, who had been as short as 7-2 ante-post favourite only three weeks ago. </p> <p>Simon Crisford, racing manager to Godolphin, said: \"Unfortunately we have run out of time with Sulamani and he will not run in the Arc. We are now looking at the Emirates Airline Champion Stakes at Newmarket on October 16 or the Canadian International at Woodbine on October 24.\" </p> <p>Mamool will be Godolphin's Arc runner and he was reported to be in \"very good form\" after working under Kerrin McEvoy on the gallops at Newmarket yesterday morning. Frankie Dettori takes over on the five-year-old at Longchamp. </p> <p>\"Mamool did his final piece of work this morning over six furlongs on the Al Bahathri. Kerrin McEvoy rode him and I was very happy,\" said trainer Saeed bin Suroor. \"I hope the ground doesn't turn too soft. Good good ground will be perfect.\" </p> <p>The going at Longchamp is currently in Mamool's favour. \"The forecast is mild with plenty of cloud cover and very little rain,\" said clerk of the course Christophe Delporte. </p> <p>Irish Derby winner Grey Swallow is set to be supplemented at a cost of \u20ac60,000 tomorrow after being described as \"an intended runner\" by his trainer Dermot Weld, who has left in Vinnie Roe. But the four-time Irish St Leger winner may wait for another crack at the Melbourne Cup. </p> <p>A second Derby winner likely to be added to the field is the Pascal Bary-trained Prix du Jockey-Club victor Blue Ca nari. But with a 20-runner limit for the race, some connections may face disappointment. </p> <p>North Light, who hardened from 11-2 to 5-1 favourite with Coral yesterday, leads the British challenge along with 9-1 shot Warrsan, the mount of Kerrin McEvoy. </p> <p>Last year's runner-up Mubtaker also stood his ground, although connections have yet to confirm him a runner. The other prospective British raiders are Ouija Board, Imperial Dancer and Nysaean. </p> <p>Top Japanese raider Tap Dance City figured among the entries despite earlier confusion that he would miss the race after his plane broke down in Mexico. But he cannot yet be considered a certain starter. </p> <p>\"He is due to arrive midweek and go to John Hammond's stable,\" said Patrick Barbe, who is representing Tap Dance City's connections in France. \"However, as his plane has not arrived at the right airport I cannot be totally confident.\" </p> <p>One long distance traveller who touched down safely yesterday was Distinction. After a 40-hour journey from Newmarket, Sir Michael Stoute's colt arrived in Melbourne. He is set to contest the Caulfield Cup on October 16 prior to challenging for the Melbourne Cup on November 2. </p> <p><strong>Dettori edges seven in front</strong></p> <p>Frankie Dettori extended his lead to seven in the jockeys' title race with a double at Nottingham yesterday. </p> <p>He started the day with a victory on Sharaiji in the opening Maiden Fillies Stakes and then followed up with Baboosh in the Letheby &amp; Christopher Maiden Stakes. </p> <p>Reigning champion Kieren Fallon was on the ball with Penalty Kick in the nursery. </p> <p>Dettori will again be at Nottingham today, while Fallon travels to Salisbury.</p>"
