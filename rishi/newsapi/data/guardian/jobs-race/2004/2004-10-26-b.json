  "<p> The handheld consoles <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/news/2004/10/08/news_6110050.html\">Nintendo DS</a>, <a href=\"http://engadget.com/entry/1883446133489767\">PSP</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gizmondo.com/flash.asp\">Gizmondo</a> will be rallying for top position in interactive hearts over the next couple of months, but a recent <a href=\"http://www.gamesindustry.biz/news.php?aid=4972\">announcement</a> that Bill Gates himself will be speaking at January's Consumer Electronics Show has shifted the speculation about next generation consoles up a gear, and turned our attentions towards that heated battle for a moment.</p> <p>Gates is expected to announce mouth-watering key features of the XBox 2, codename Xenon, potentially called \"XBox Next\", thus confirming years of speculation. Among the titbits he's expected to discuss are the connectivity components, the hard drive capabilities and the release date. He recently spoke with a French newspaper about its multimedia aspects. Gamesindustry.biz has a great review of the article <a href=\"http://www.gamesindustry.biz/news.php?aid=1229\">here</a>.</p> <p>PlayStation's well-oiled marketing machine has had us guessing about its future since before the PlayStation 2 was released in 2000 with pre-emptory purchases of a PlayStation 3 domain name. Thus far the rumours about their next generation machine continue to be little more than fan boy-fluff, though all the knowledge you could hope to have can be found at the <a href=\"http://www.ps3portal.com/\">PS3portal</a>. Meanwhile, they're distracting us with spin-offs like the <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/games/archives/playstation/2004/09/new_playstation_2.html\">PSTwo</a>, if only to overflow their bulging coffers.</p> <p>Nintendo is also in on the act, and their top secret next-gen console \"<a href=\"http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?section_name=pub&amp;aid=3593\">Revolution</a>\" could be the leader of the pack, potentially re-launching the halcyon days of Nintendo-domination; their release date is tentatively set for <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/entry/1264827625182461/\">2006</a>. The <a href=\"http://cube.ign.com/articles/522/522559p1.html?fromint=1\">IGN</a> has a good bit of information on what the future holds for Mario and his pals.</p> <p>The danger, of course is that the hubbub which will ensue on the part of marketers, PR people, journalists, game developers and consumers is going to undermine the value of the products released for the current machines. Instead of focussing on these, column inches, training sessions and window dressing are likely to focus on potential titles (and skills) for the future hardware.</p> <p>Considering there is still a lot of life left in the old machines - if the phenomenal <a href=\"http://www.computerandvideogames.com/r/?page=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/news/news_story.php(que)id=97876\">sales</a> of PlayStation 2's after the releases of EyeToy Play and SingStar are anything to go by - this focus could damage the industry's implicit intentions to broaden their appeal to the non-hardcore, casual market. There was brief discussion at Edinburgh's <a href=\"http://www.eigf.co.uk\">international games festival</a> in 2003 about the proclivity to \"rainbow chase\" future technologies, relegating contemporary products to the sub-worthwhile bin. Hopefully late-cycle arrivals like <a href=\"http://www.rockstargames.com/sanandreas/\">GTA:San Andreas</a>, <a href=\"http://www.xbox.com/assets/en-us/Flash/games/halo2/home.html\">Halo 2</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/news/2004/05/05/news_6095429.html\">EyeToy Chat</a> will maintain enough interest in the old machines to keep them out of car boot sales for a little while.</p> <p>Regardless, let the race begin!</p>",
  "<b>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday October 27, 2004</b> <br> In the report below, we say that President Mbeki criticised \"bigots\" who regard black people as \"sub-human disease-carriers\". Mr Mbeki did not use these words, though the infelicitous addition of quote marks in an editing stage suggested he did so. What he said was that people \"whose minds have been corrupted by the disease of racism\" accused black people of being \"diseased, corrupt, violent, amoral, sexually depraved, animalistic\". <p>President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa has caused a race row by making a scathing attack on white people who link HIV/Aids to the alleged promiscuous and predatory behaviour of black Africans. </p> <p>Mr Mbeki turned a parliamentary debate on HIV and rape into a broadside against \"bigots\" who he said regarded black people as \"sub-human disease-carriers\". </p> <p>The president was asked about his silence on a pandemic which infects 5.6 million South Africans, more than in any other country, and replied that the real issue was prejudice, which endured a decade after apartheid. </p> <p>\"I will not keep quiet while others whose minds have been corrupted by the disease of racism accuse us, the black people of South Africa, Africa and the world, as being, by virtue of our Africanness and skin colour, lazy, liars, foul-smelling, diseased, corrupt, violent, amoral, sexually depraved, animalistic, savage and rapist.\" </p> <p>Using language which disconcerted some of his own supporters, Mr Mbeki said certain white people regarded black people as \"rampant sexual beasts, unable to control our urges, unable to keep our legs crossed, unable to keep it in our pants.\" </p> <p>The main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, said the comments were a a disgrace which made false accusations of racism, and the president was ignoring a disease estimated to kill at least 600 South Africans every day. </p> <p>Since succeeding Nelson Mandela as president in 1999 Mr Mbeki has queried the connection between HIV and Aids and the safety of anti-retroviral drugs, citing research by dissident scientists who have suggested that the disease is not transmitted by sexual contact. </p> <p>Critics said he had fallen for crank theories, and after a wave of protest inside and outside South Africa he announced that he would \"withdraw\" from the debate. </p> <p>The government started a national treatment programme earlier this year but the target of treating 53,000 people by March has slipped, prompting lobby groups to complain about a lack of urgency. </p> <p>Earlier this month Mr Mbeki broke his silence and edged back into the controversy in a column on the African National Congress party website which lambasted white commentators for complaining about high rates of sexual violence. </p> <p>Official statistics showed that serious crime was falling, he said, but people who were racist and wanted the country to fail falsely claimed South Africa was the world's rape capital. </p> <p>This prompted the opposition to table written parliamentary questions about the extent of rape and its contribution to the spread of HIV. </p> <p>In reply Mr Mbeki said he would not discuss Aids but would stick to the central issue, which was the bigotry that thrived a decade after the end of white minority rule. </p> <p>\"Millions of Africans in our country, in Africa and the world did not fight against apartheid racism and white domination to create space for them to continue to be subjected to dehumanising, demeaning and insulting racism,\" he said. </p> <p>Tony Leon, leader of the largely white Democratic Alliance, said Mr Mbeki had ducked a simple yes-or-no question about whether he was prepared to lead the fight against HIV/Aids. </p> <p>\"Instead ... he recited a litany of racist caricatures that bordered on the pornographic and implied that the DA believed them.\" He accused the state broadcaster, SABC, of editing reports of the debate to spare Mr Mbeki embarrassment. </p> <p>The Johannesburg paper the Sunday Times said Mr Mbeki had reason to harp on race, but his \"rising anger\" had prompted hyperbole and \"unpresidential venom\" which demeaned the debate. </p> <p>\"For a man who claims membership of the African intelligentsia, that is a crass representation of the challenge we face as a nation seeking redemption after a history of unspeakable bigotry,\" it said.</p>",
  "<p>Hampshire have beaten off competition from Surrey and Kent to sign Kevin Pietersen, one of England's best young batting prospects. </p> <p>Pietersen, 24 and born in Natal but who has just been selected for England's one-day tour of Zimbabwe, has enjoyed four successful seasons with Nottinghamshire, but his departure was hardly a surprise. </p> <p>He fell out with the county in 2003 and at the end of that season the captain Jason Gallian allegedly flung his kit from the pavilion balcony. </p> <p>Pietersen, who averages 54 in first-class cricket and 41 in one-day games, was born in Pietermaritzburg and has an Afrikaner father though his mother was born in Kent. He refused to represent South Africa, he said, as he objects to the country's quota system. </p> <p>Headstrong and opinionated, Pietersen has the ability to rile team-mates just as his batting can trouble opponents. </p> <p>He was talked out of leaving Trent Bridge in 2003 by the ECB Academy director Rod Marsh, who saw the prospect of the batsman playing no cricket last summer. The Australian, perhaps, is his greatest champion and was in charge of the side in India a year ago when Pietersen scored four centuries in as many matches.</p>",
  "<p>The City of London police yesterday confirmed that more arrests have been made in the ongoing investigation into allegations of corruption and race-fixing, which hit the headlines when more than 130 officers from the force arrested 16 people after raiding 19 addresses on September 1. </p> <p>Among those arrested in that dawn swoop was the current champion jockey Kieren Fallon. However, it is understood that none of the latest individuals is licensed by the Jockey Club. </p> <p>The City police were brought in at the request of the Jockey Club's director of security, Paul Scotney. \"There have been a number of arrests over the period since September 2,\" said a spokesman for the force yesterday, adding: \"We have always said more arrests were likely to follow after those in September.\" </p> <p>All 16 arrested then were released on police bail and are due to appear again on November 2. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the wet weather continues to play havoc with the Flat race programme. Following the loss of yesterday's Leicester card, today's scheduled meetings at Catterick and Nottingham were called off yesterday due to waterlogging. </p> <p>Six extra Wolverhampton all-weather fixtures were confirmed yesterday by the British Horseracing Board to take place in November and early December.</p>"
