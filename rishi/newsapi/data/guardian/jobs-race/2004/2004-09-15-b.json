  "<p>The UK economy continued to create jobs at a steady pace in August as unemployment fell to a 20-year low, official figures showed today.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the number of people out of work in the three months to July stood at 1.1 million, down 16,000 from the three months to April and the lowest figure since the current method of measuring unemployment began in 1984.</p> <p>The unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.7% in the quarter to July from 4.8% the previous quarter. For August, the number of people claiming the Jobseeker's Allowance fell by 6,100 to 830,200, slightly less than the expected decline of 10,000 but still bringing the figure to its lowest since July 1975. </p> <p>In percentage terms, the claimant count rate stood at 2.7%, its lowest level since April 1975.</p> <p>Despite a tightening of the labour market, inflationary pressures in terms of average wage growth remained subdued. </p> <p>In the three months to July, average earnings including bonuses increased by 3.8% over the same period a year ago, their weakest pace of growth since last December. Excluding bonuses, earnings rose 4.2%, unchanged from the three months to June. </p> <p>Analysts said the Bank of England would be particularly pleased to see that underlying annual average earnings growth was stable at 4.2%. </p> <p>\"The stability in underlying earnings further eases pressure for another interest rate hike in the near future,\" said Howard Archer, an economist with the consultancy Global Insight.</p> <p>\"Even so, we still believe another 25 basis point hike in interest rates before the end of the year is more likely than not.\"</p> <p>The ONS said the number of people in employment had remained almost unchanged over the quarter but the trend was still upward and there had been an increase over the year. </p> <p>The employment level was 28.3 million in the three months to July 2004, down 1,000 from the previous quarter but up 179,000 on the same three months last year.</p> <p>Of the 25 countries that make up the EU, only four have lower rates of unemployment than Britain: Austria, Cyprus, Ireland and Luxembourg. </p> <p>Manufacturing, however, continued to suffer. The number of people working in the sector was down 93,000 to 3.3 million in the three months to July compared with the same period last year.</p>",
  "<p>Frankie Dettori is 4-5 favourite with Ladbrokes to win his first jockeys' title since 1995 after drawing level with Kieren Fallon, now an even money shot, on 149 winners yesterday. </p> <p>Dettori briefly took the lead with a 14-1 double at Yarmouth only for Fallon to claw back to all square with a success in the last race at Salisbury. </p> <p>\"It's good to be upsides Kieren, let's carry on,\" said Dettori. Both riders should be among the winners at Yarmouth today, and this time Fallon may have the edge. </p> <p>The reigning champion has good prospects of notching a double on the well-regarded two-year-old <strong> Home Affairs (2.40)</strong>, a Dewhurst Stakes entry, and <strong> Salinor (4.50)</strong>. </p> <p>John Sanderson's management team at Doncaster has had its contract terminated in a move seen as part of the fall-out from the rivalry between the Racing UK and At The Races television channels. </p> <p>Arena Leisure, major shareholders in At The Races, are to take over management of the Town Moor track with immediate effect. Sanderson was a key figure in setting up the Horse Racing Channel, which later became Racing UK.</p>"
