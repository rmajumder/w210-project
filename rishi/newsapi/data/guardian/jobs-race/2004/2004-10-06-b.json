  "<p>John Toshack is emerging as the favourite to succeed Mark Hughes as manager of Wales, although there are seven candidates, according to the Football Association of Wales. </p> <p>Ian Rush, Gary Speed, Brian Flynn, G\u00e9rard Houllier and Philippe Troussier are among the others, along with one unknown candidate. </p> <p>Hughes steps down after the game against Poland in Cardiff next Wednesday and the FAW then has until next March before Wales's next competitive games, against Austria in Cardiff and Vienna. The FAW board is expected to meet on October 28 and will recommend interviews from there. </p> <p>Rush has impressed the FAW with his work with the Wales Under-17s but the 42-year-old possesses nothing like the experience of the 55-year-old Toshack. </p> <p>\"Toshack is high on the list,\" an FAW member was reported as saying, \"but it all depends on the interviews. The interviews will be the deciding factor.\" </p> <p>After a 24-year managerial career, which began at Swansea, Toshack is out of work. He managed Real Madrid to the Spanish league title in 1989 but has not had so many highlights at the likes of St Etienne and Real Betis. </p> <p>Toshack has upset some in the Wales squad with his criticism of them in his role as a television pundit and newspaper columnist. There are also those within the FAW who remember how Toshack walked away from the Wales job after one game a decade ago. </p> <p>Speed, who harbours managerial ambitions, is also among the favourites for the position. He has taken one of the two requisite Uefa badges and is expected to complete the other soon. </p> <p>But he has just signed a two-year contract at Bolton and at 35 has kept himself fit and feels he can play Premiership football until the end of next season. </p> <p>However, Hughes first took over the job while playing for Southampton and retained the role as he moved to Everton and lastly Blackburn.</p>",
  "The closure of the Royal Festival Hall in London for refurbishment in July 2005 will result in 181 redundancies, it emerged yesterday. <p>\"Staff have been informed ... and consultations are beginning with the two unions representing staff,\" a statement said. </p> <p>The redundancies will affect about a third of the workforce, a spokesperson said, \"though we will be staffing up again in 2007 when the hall reopens\". </p> <p>A spokesperson from Amicus, one of the unions affected, said: \"We want to ensure any compulsory redundancies are kept to a minimum.\" </p> <p>During the closure period the two resident orchestras, the Philharmonia and the London Philharmonic, will present a reduced programme at the neighbouring Queen Elizabeth Hall. </p> <p>Because of the smaller capacity of the temporary venue, the LPO alone stands to lose \u00a3600,000 on box office income, according to Timothy Walker, artistic director and chief executive.</p>",
  "The London borough of Kensington and Chelsea is famous for its posh shops and well-heeled residents, but it is less well-known that the local council is setting trends of a different kind with initiatives to help people with mental illness back to work. <p>For the second year running, and coinciding with World Mental Health Week, the council is holding an employment and training fair to promote awareness of the opportunities available for people in the borough with mental health problems. </p> <p>The event, which will take place next Wednesday, will be attended by potential employers, service users, and a range of the borough's service providers. The number of people taking part is expected to outstrip last year's attendance. </p> <p>The council wants the fair to be high profile, but this is not to say the exercise is cosmetic. Roger Butterworth, director of NHS Liaison, Work Life Partnership - a specialist in exploring ways to get people with mental health problems in to long- term, fulfilling jobs - says the event is the public face of \"valuable work at ground level by the council\". </p> <p>Butterworth, who is scheduled to give a talk at the event, says it is only one part of a whole range of initiatives by the council's mental health employment and steering group. He says: \"All the research I have seen shows that it is better to help people back into work than to try to pick up the pieces afterwards. Kensington and Chelsea has been proactive in doing this.\" </p> <p>One approach that seems to be working well, according to Butterworth, is that of Smart (St Mary Abbots Rehabilitation and Training). The council commissions the centre to work with residents taking their first steps to getting back to work. Advisers assess training needs and point people in the direction of the right job opportunities. </p> <p>The service works, according to the council, because it is at the user's pace. If someone is not quite ready to apply directly for a job, they may, for example, be encouraged to retrain. In addition, advisers are on hand once someone has found employment to help them with any difficulties they might face. </p> <p>Joan Quinn (not her real name) is someone who benefited from Kensington and Chelsea's approach. \"It has been great for me,\" she enthuses. \"I was referred to Smart and ended up working for them for a while before retraining as a nursing assistant. I had depression but I haven't had a relapse for a long while now.\" </p> <p>Kensington and Chelsea acknowledges that both private sector employers and its own departments and agencies need to be committed to creating a climate that supports people with a range of mental illnesses. Next week's event should help raise awareness of what is already on offer, but the aim is also to encourage employers to \"come on board and help break down barriers to employment\". </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The employment and training fair will be held at the Small Hall, Kensington Town Hall, on October 13, from 11am to 4pm.</p>"
