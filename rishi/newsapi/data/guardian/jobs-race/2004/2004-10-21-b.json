  "<p>Citigroup, the global banking company, yesterday ousted three of its most senior executives in an attempt to restore its battered reputation in Japan. </p> <p>The casualties included vice-chairman Sir Deryck Maughan, one of the few Britons to rise to the top of a major Wall Street firm. </p> <p>Last month Japan's financial regulator ordered the closure of Citigroup's private bank for violation of banking laws. </p> <p>Investigators said the bank failed to conduct proper checks against money laun dering, and they alleged fraud had taken place within the retail unit. </p> <p>Chuck Prince, the group chief executive, has been stung by the scandal and other regulatory and legal problems in the past year; he has vowed to restore high ethical standards. </p> <p>Sir Deryck, 56, the son of Durham coal miner, headed Citigroup's international division as well as being vice-chairman. He rose to prominence on Wall Street when Warren Buffett recruited him in 1992 to head Salomon Brothers in the wake of a bond trading scandal. </p> <p>His career began at the Treasury, which he left in 1979 to join Goldman Sachs. Until yesterday he was regarded as one of Wall Street's great survivors, having stayed with Salomon through the mergers and acquisitions by which it metamorphosed into Citigroup. </p> <p>In the process, Sir Deryck became a pillar of the New York establishment, sitting on the board of Carnegie Hall, the prestigious music venue. He is also a non-executive director of GlaxoSmithKline. </p> <p>Citigroup made no comment on the departures. Instead, Mr Prince sent a five-sentence email to senior colleagues saying that Sir Deryck, Thomas Jones, head of investment management, and Peter Scaturro, who ran private banking, would be leaving. The memo gave no reason for the departures, even though all three were members of the Citigroup management committee. </p> <p>As well as scandal in Japan, Citigroup has suffered from charges that it manipulated the bond market in Europe in an incident that is being investigated by the Financial Services Authority. </p> <p>Last month, Tom Maheras, head of global capital markets, said the bank regretted the controversial \u00a37bn bond trade that left rivals nursing heavy losses.</p>",
  "<p>Darren Lehmann, the Australia vice-captain who is fighting for his Test place in India after just 62 runs in four innings, has attacked his bosses for not giving him better support during his notorious race row with Sri Lanka almost two years ago.</p> <p>Yorkshire batsman Lehmann, 34, was banned for five one-day internationals after screaming \"black cunts\" after being run out by Sri Lanka during a one-day match in Brisbane in January, 2003.</p> <p>In his book, Darren Lehmann - Worth the Wait, which is being serialised in Australia's Herald-Sun newspaper, he says: \"I was disappointed by the lack of support, certainly in the public arena, that I received from Cricket Australia.</p> <p>\"I am not for a second asking them to condone what I did, but I thought that, I was one of their employees, they may have been able to state somewhere during the maelstrom that was engulfing me that I was a good person with a pretty good record over 15 years.</p> <p>\"They never said it was totally out of character, nor that I had co-operated fully with all the relevant people associated with the investigation and hearing.\"</p> <p>Lehmann addresses his outburst in a chapter entitled Those Two Words. \"Anger built up in me as I got closer and closer to the room and once in there I exploded, in the worst possible way,\" he writes.</p> <p>\"The two words I regrettably used were 'black cunts'. Contrary to the finding at a later hearing, I was well and truly inside our dressing-room when I yelled out those words. It is not something that I had said before and it certainly isn't something I have said since.</p> <p>Lehmann's outburst was overheard by the Sri Lanka players. Reprimanded by the match referee, Clive Lloyd, he apologised, verbally and in writing to Sri Lanka.</p> <p>But if he thought the matter was closed he was in for a shock. Malcolm Speed, the chief executive of the International Cricket Council, was not satisfied by Lloyd's action and demanded a re-hearing.</p> <p>Lehmann says that he felt he had been \"drawn and quartered\" by Speed before the hearing, after which he was suspended for five ODI matches, including Australia's opening game in the World Cup.</p> <p>Since then Lehmann, out of fashion during Steve Waugh's captaincy, has nailed down a middle-order position. But that is now endangered by Michael Clarke, Australia's leading scorer in the first two of the four Tests in India, with 212 runs at 70.66. </p> <p>Both Lehmann and Clarke are likely to play when the third Test starts in Nagpur on Tuesday. But captain Ricky Ponting is expected to return for the final Test in Mumbai the following week, with Lehmann the favourite to make way. </p> <p>The players have been enjoying a mid-series break since the last Test in Chennai, with Singapore, Goa and Mumbai the favourite retreats. They are expected to regroup this weekend before flying to Nagpur tomorrow night. They will be back in the nets on Sunday and Monday.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Trevor McDonald yesterday branded a Tory MP \"juvenile\" for suggesting that he had risen to become a leading newscaster because of his race. </p> <p>Jonathan Sayeed, MP for Mid Bedfordshire, has apologised for recommending that the veteran ITN newsreader be asked: \"Do you ever feel embarrassed at having benefitted from positive discrimination?\" </p> <p>The question, which was emailed to the Independent, was a reply to the paper's request for tough questions to be put to Sir Trevor during a charity interview. </p> <p>Mr Sayeed, whose father was Indian, said yesterday he had made a mistake in wording his question. He said he had meant to ask if Sir Trevor felt embarrassed about \"the allegation\" that his colour had helped him succeed. </p> <p>\"If I have caused any offence inadvertently then I will of course apologise,\" he said. \"I would point out that with a surname like mine and with my family background and with being against any form of discrimination based on skin colour for over 20 years, I am the last person to poke fun at someone who has achieved so much.\" </p> <p>Mr Sayeed's office said the MP had phoned to apologise, but had not been able to speak personally to Sir Trevor and had left a message with his assistant. </p> <p>Sir Trevor said any such suggestion was \"juvenile\" rather than offensive. </p> <p>\"It would be nice to know how I've benefited from positive discrimination,\" he said. </p> <p>Among the wittier \"killer\" questions submitted to the paper for the Trinidad-born broadcaster was: \"How come you got a knighthood before Jon Snow?\" </p> <p>Sir Trevor was one of the first ethnic minority television journalists on British screens.
