  "<p>The lecturers' union Natfhe today criticised universities for dragging their feet over implementing laws concerning race equality in employment.</p> <p>The union is also pressing for new pay agreements being worked out this year to be assessed against race relations legislation, or universities would face a \"barrage\" of employment tribunal claims.</p> <p>A survey by the funding council Hefce found one in five institutions were making only limited progress towards fulfilling their obligations under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 (RRAA). </p> <p>The survey covered 66 universities and colleges - a further four did not submit reports. \"Two-thirds were progressing reasonably or positively. About 13% could be said to be making impressive progress, while around 20% were, for various reasons, more limited in their progress,\" said the report published last month. The survey looked at institutions' policies on paper, not how well they were being implemented.</p> <p>The head of the union's universities department, Roger Kline, said: \"The Hefce report shows that a substantial number of universities are dragging their feet when it comes to monitoring the numbers of black and ethnic minority staff.\"</p> <p>He said many institutions were still not publishing essential data on the ethnicity of staff. \"Even worse, many fall well short of their minimum legal obligations. Some of the worst performers are significant national institutions like Manchester University, which did not even respond to Hefce's survey.\"</p> <p>He added: \"These laws were introduced to challenge institutional racism following the death of Stephen Lawrence. It is four years since the Race Relations Amendment Act was introduced, yet British universities still remain a desperately pale place. The average black full-time lecturer is paid \u00a34,300 less a year than their white counterpart. Universities need to start changing their policies - they're still not doing nearly enough.</p> <p>\"Natfhe has formally asked Hefce to instruct universities and colleges to undertake a race impact assessment of their proposals to implement the framework agreement on pay, otherwise employment tribunals may soon be packed to the rafters with higher education discrimination claims.\"</p> <p>The Hefce report said: \"Institutions in areas with larger black and ethnic minority populations tend to have made better progress than those in areas with low black and minority ethnic demographic profiles. While this may not seem surprising, it indicates that some higher education institutions in predominantly white areas are struggling to develop effective ways of attracting staff and/or student candidates from beyond their local communities.</p> <p>\"However, a significant number of such institutions are trying new and innovative methods, with positive results, such as targeted advertising in ethnic minority media, recruitment drives in more diverse areas within the region, reviews of recruitment and selection procedures, and commissioned research into the causes of low ethnic minority recruitment.\"</p> <p>Firm leadership and commitment from senior levels were required to ensure race equality was recognised as a key strand of the equalities agenda, said the report.</p>",
  "Wide streets lead off a big central square. There is a church, a theatre, a sports complex and a hotel. But there are but no people. The desert sun is as ferocious as it always has been - the terraced houses cool, welcoming and empty. <p>In the late 1960s, the last families moved out reluctantly. As the gates were locked behind them, Humber-stone, in the Atacama desert of -northern Chile, became a ghost town. </p> <p>Less than a century ago the town was enjoying its heyday - alive with Latin Americans working for the booming nitrate industry. International sales of the fertiliser, or white gold as it was known locally, had bought unimagined riches to Chile. </p> <p>Today, the hopes of those who care about Humberstone rest again with foreign nations as they wait to hear if their application to Unesco to designate Humberstone a world heritage site has been accepted. Success would mean international funding, both for restoration and, crucially, improved security. </p> <p>Of the many other nitrate towns on the Chilean pampas, almost nothing is left. Settlements and industrial remains have been plundered, flattened by those trying to salvage crumbs from a business that once bought them their livelihoods. Just Humberstone and a neighbouring industrial plant called Santa Laura have survived. </p> <p>The town was once home to 4,000 people and seen as the most modern on the pampas. James Thomas Humberstone, the English engineer after whom the town was renamed in 1934, had bought from England not only a new refining system for raw nitrate, but also liberal ideas about workers rights and conditions. When ownership passed to the British in the 1930s, a rebuilding programme began. There was electricity and running water in each home, playing fields for football, basketball, baseball and a swimming pool. Elegant fountains flowed and in the evening music was broadcast through loudspeakers in the plaza. </p> <p>Today's visitor is an uneasy voyeur, wandering the eerie streets, peering through doors and windows. Graffiti on the walls is left by visitors reliving moments of personal history: \"I was born in this pueblo, 1955\"; \"I was in this class-room 1945-49\"; even \"I danced here\". Wooden planks on the floor around the chair where a Japanese hairdresser worked are worn away in a semi-circle. And the plaza, once alive with shrubs, flowers and children is desolate, the bandstand a curious reminder of lost life. </p> <p>The government, with contributions from mining companies, is funding a small retoration pro gramme. The church is immaculate with shining floorboards and pastel green walls - the hotel and school could be used tomorrow. But the wide streets of white-washed terraced housing, the supermarket, the big hospital and the swimming pool, eccentrically constructed from the metal hull of a ship, are all crumbling. </p> <p>At the neighbouring Santa Laura, a massive rusting industrial structure looms like a beached ship high above the pock-marked nitrate fields. The process began with the raw nitrate being blasted with gunpowder from the surrounding desert and carried by mule trucks or later train to the plant. There is was broken up, heated, purified and crystallised again to make fertiliser. </p> <p>Many of the labourers were poor rural Chileans, lured from the -fertile south to fill a gap in the labour force left by a five-year war against Peru and Bolivia - the war that saw Chile win ownership of these nitrate lands. They arrived into a wasteland, devoid of all vegetation, where daily temperatures can range more than 30C. The work was dangerous, safety standards pitiful and payment in tokens valid only in these company towns. </p> <p>By the 1950s the industry had been hit by the introduction of German developed artificial fertiliser and, with Humberstone bankrupt, production stopped in 1961. </p> <p>In summer, crowds of Chileans visit Iquique for its beaches and huge duty-free mall. A few take day trips to see the rock paintings preserved in the desert, lunching by hot spring pools in small oasis -settlements. </p> <p>For the most part the ghost town of Humberstone lies quiet, awaiting Unesco's decision, forgotten above the hedonism of the resort below.</p>"
