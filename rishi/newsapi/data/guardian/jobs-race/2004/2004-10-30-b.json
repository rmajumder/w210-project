  "This time of year the Christian calendar has a lot to do with the word \"all\": All Angels, All Saints, All Souls. We celebrate not some saints or souls (the ones we like or are like us) but \"all\". Traditionally, of course, we like to think of saints in much more exclusive ways. Protestant or catholic, liberal or conservative, ancient or modern, Christians have always been attracted by the notion of a class system of believers in which sanctity becomes a matter of admiring, or even idolising, the personal qualities of individuals. <p>But the life of faith is not about the lives of individuals: when push comes to shove faith is not \"personal\", but relational, not private but corporate. Being a Christian is not essentially about having little Me and God Bonding Moments. Jesus is unrelenting on this in the gospels: love God, love your neighbour, he says. That's the bottom line. The famous Beatitudes, the traditional reading for All Saints, emphasises this too. Like the prophets before him, Jesus takes no prisoners on this point. If you think, he says, that loving God somehow gets you off the hook of loving people, than you simply have not begun to get the point. </p> <p>Saints, then, are not saints in their individualism, but in their relationship to others. Or to put it another way, sanctity is best understood in terms of its effect on others. And the corporate life of faith involves encountering and knowing saints - people who help and inspire us in our own faith exactly because the life of faith is not a private or privatised activity. The early Christian martyrs died not for a principle, but because they knew Jesus Christ \"as Lord\"; that is to say, they were in relationship with him. Saints are not super Christians in that usual hierarchical sense, but they are people who make us feel differently, think differently, about the world and about ourselves. As the late Latin American liberation theolo gian, Dom Helder Camara once famously commented: \"When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist\". Saints can be awkward, difficult people, who in fact undermine the very hierarchies we want to create. </p> <p>In my experience, saints are people - and not all are or were Christians - whether I know them in the flesh or know them through their writings or biographers, who make me feel more deeply the love of God and therefore my calling to love others. The poet WH Auden once wrote: \"I have met in my life two persons, one a man, the other a woman, who convinced me that they were persons of sanctity. Utterly different in character, upbringing and interests as they were, their effect on me was the same. In their presence I felt myself to be ten times as nice, ten times as intelligent, ten times as good-looking as I really am.\" </p> <p>In other words, Auden's sense of his own worthlessness took a back seat when in the presence of these \"saints\". And note Auden's key point: he felt ten times better looking than he was, not ten times better looking than somebody else. To honour the saints, is not to indulge in our own sense of how unsaintly we are, to have a self-indulgent go at all our inadequacies (real and imagined), a good grovel before a God who, for some reason, we think likes that sort of thing - but to let their lives transform us, to let their faith strengthen us. </p> <p>Why? Well, so that we might be for someone else, someone who makes him or her feel \"ten times as nice, ten times as intelligent, ten times as good-looking as\" they really are. In short, the way God sees us all: no spiritual class system, no theological brownie points, no hierarchy, all equally loved, equally of worth, the hallmarks of the Kingdom of God. The Christian believes that God in Christ pours out grace to human persons - not so that it can be possessed - but so it can be passed on. And anyone who does that, who brings that Kingdom slightly more realised, does Christ's work - is, very simply, a saint. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Canon Dr Judith Maltby is chaplain and fellow of Corpus Christi College and reader in church history in the University of Oxford</p>",
  "<p>What constitutes a professional hairstyle? Is straightened hair any more or less professional than hair that's in its natural, curly state? Are braids more professional than china bumps? What about dreadlocks, or an afro? Does it even matter any more? </p> <p>Well, apparently, it does. I've just had a call from a lawyer friend who's recently changed firms, saying she's been taken to one side and asked - politely, of course - if she could come back into the office on Monday with her hair \"properly done\". The friend was wearing her hair in cane rows, a style that takes at least an hour to do. </p> <p>The sad thing is that, after my initial outrage, I realised I wasn't actually that surprised - and neither were any of the black friends I mentioned it to. Angry and frustrated on her behalf, yes, but not as shocked as you'd hope in the circumstances. </p> <p>We may have come a long way from the idea that if you want to have a hope of working in an office, you had to wear your hair straight (or, at a push, tied back), but, judging by my friend's experience, not far enough. I don't know a single black man, for example, who works in an office and doesn't have his hair shaved in a close crop, and I don't know any black women working in the City who don't have their hair straightened. When I talk to these friends about it, male and female, their responses are virtually identical - \"I don't want to look too black,\" says one. \"I don't want to freak people out,\" says another. </p> <p>\"As much as it shouldn't matter, I think it does, especially for men,\" says my friend Nana, echoing the others.\"They wouldn't even let you through the door of some places in the City if you were a guy with cane rows.\" </p> <p>As far as I can make out, the more traditional the style, the less well it is regarded. Whereas with white folk it's the other way around: it's the new Hoxton fins that are regarded with suspicion, rather than, say, the traditional short back and sides.</p>",
  "A Black Watch soldier was killed in a road accident yesterday as the heavily armed convoy he was travelling in moved towards its new base. <p>The unnamed victim became the first fatality of the unit's controversial redeployment to a camp south-west of Baghdad when his Warrior armoured fighting vehicle overturned. </p> <p>Three of his comrades suffered slight injuries when the vehicle rolled over as it was heading north towards Camp Dogwood, 20 miles west of the insurgent stronghold of Mahmudiya. </p> <p>The tragedy further delayed the huge convoy as it inched towards its final destination, more than two days after setting off from the southern city of Basra. </p> <p>Road accidents remain the biggest danger for British forces, with more personnel killed as a result of traffic mishaps than any other reason. </p> <p>Black Watch soldiers also came under attack within hours of moving north, halted by a series of roadside bombs planted by insurgents, British army spokesmen said. </p> <p>Camp Dogwood itself was also targeted. The sprawling former logistics base was hit by an explosive device as the troops were preparing to move in. </p> <p>A British army spokesman confirmed that half the convoy had been delayed by more than 24 hours because of insurgent activity on the approach to the camp. </p> <p>At one stage, senior officers feared the troops would have to fight their way into their new base, which was once used by Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard. </p> <p>It is sited at least 20 miles west of the so-called Triangle of Death, which contains several towns where ambushes, bombings and kidnappings have become common. </p> <p>The attacks highlight the fears surrounding the deployment of 850 British soldiers to take over from American units which are needed to quell insurgent activity in Falluja. </p> <p>The convoy of troops and Warrior fighting vehicles set off from Basra on Wednesday morning for the 360-mile journey north, mostly by main roads. </p> <p>But at noon on Thursday a bomb planted by insurgents exploded as the convoy was passing along Route Midland, about 10 miles from the camp, forcing several low-loaders off the road. </p> <p>Soldiers found a second bomb nearby - a common terrorist tactic to kill or maim survivors of an initial attack. </p> <p>As drivers at the rear took an alternative road to the camp, Route San Juan, a helicopter escort spotted a third device. </p> <p>At least half the convoy was forced to spend the night at a second safe way-station. </p> <p>The last remaining vehicles reached the camp by 2pm yesterday, but only after soldiers had found a fourth unexploded bomb on their approach. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> This is a pooled report from Padraic Flanagan of the Daily Express</p>",
  "The rural middle class seldom enthuses about the law courts these days, for they are perceived as absurdly indulgent to hooligans, asylum seekers, murderers and malefactors of all kinds. Yet a mighty cheer went up on Tuesday, following the conviction of a career burglar named John Rae, who was jailed for seven years for a long series of offences. <p>The cause of the applause was that Judge Andrew Hamilton endorsed the action of a 73-year-old Derbyshire farmer, Kenneth Faulkner, who shot Rae in the leg during an attempted break-in, after an earlier burglary in which some of his guns had been stolen. \"Mr Faulkner believed that he was being targeted,\" said the judge, \"and he was entirely right. He wrongly believed that the burglars had come back armed with those guns that had been stolen. Very sensibly he took out his own shotgun. No one could criticise him for what he did.\" </p> <p>The judge went on to deplore the fact that the Crown Prosecution Service considered charges of assault against the farmer, which were dropped only shortly before Rae's trial. Here at last, in the minds of many country people, was a sensible judicial view about a man's right to protect himself. </p> <p>The police, however, seemed thoroughly alarmed by the judge's comments. No doubt envisaging a barrage of gunfire against suspected intruders, the Association of Chief Police Officers issued a statement urging householders not to resist. Instead, said Acpo, they should lock themselves into a room and dial 999: \"You should not approach the intruder. If the intruder steals some of your property, that's far better than someone being killed.\" </p> <p>These words prompted a jeer of derision in many a village pub. The police have a rotten record of effective intervention at scenes of rural crime. The shortcomings of law enforcement were highlighted the very next day, when a fiasco was reported in the press. A farmer who caught and successfully detained two intruders stealing tractor diesel fuel from his tank in the presence of witnesses was told that the thieves would not be prosecuted \"for lack of evidence\". Critics demand: how can the police with straight faces urge householders to rely on the law, when the law is an ass? </p> <p>About now, some readers may suppose that I am launching a manifesto for the right of property owners to shoot down burglars. Not so. The doctrine of \"proportionate force\" in resisting crime, enshrined in existing law, seems absolutely correct. I have owned guns all my life. Yet, unless I perceived myself and my loved ones facing an indisputable threat to our own lives, I cannot imagine attempting to shoot somebody. </p> <p>In the United States, gun ownership is widespread. A right to defend property is recognised in law. The consequence is that there are horrific cases of innocent people being gunned down by mistake, for instance when they knock up a house at night to ask directions. Some Americans argue that this is a price worth paying for achieving a burglary rate much lower than that which prevails in Europe. Most of us dissent. </p> <p>British law dealt harshly with the Norfolk farmer Tony Martin, who received a long term of imprisonment after shooting a burglar dead. A token sentence seemed more appropriate, when Martin had been grievously provoked by repeated visits from inveterate thieves. </p> <p>Yet I could never share the view that the farmer was a middle-class martyr. Evidence made it plain that he had deliberately shot the burglar dead while he was attempting to flee. He faced no plausible threat to his own safety. How can the law not uphold the sanctity of human life, even that of a professional criminal? </p> <p>It is hard to see a rational basis for the current campaign for new legislation, to allow householders to use more force in defending their property. What seems needed is a more sensitive approach by the authorities towards the predicament of people living in the countryside who suffer from crime. </p> <p>Everybody has his or her horror story, and few report an effective police response. Some middle-aged friends of ours were visited a few years ago in their remote house by a gang who tied them up and tortured them for some hours, to persuade them to disclose the whereabouts of non-existent valuables and cash. Psychologically, the couple have never recovered from the ordeal. </p> <p>In recent months there has been a string of big country-house burglaries in our area, for which the suspects are well-known, but no successful prosecutions have yet resulted. The farmyard behind our own home was recently stripped of an assortment of power tools, a common form of petty larceny. So what, you may say? Yet if people live alone, some distance from other habitations, and especially if they are elderly, fear becomes very real. If attacked in the country, people can shout their heads off for aid without hope of being heard. Rural dwellers really are on their own. Once a local attack has taken place, the familiar, precious sense of security in one's own home is hard to maintain. </p> <p> A s alarm systems become commonplace, more and more rural crimes are deliberately undertaken when premises are known to be occupied, and thus alarms are switched off. An elderly couple near us were visited recently by two men posing as meter readers, who beat them severely before making off with their pitiful spoils. There seems a good case for awarding an exceptional sentence to any criminal who knowingly targets the old. </p> <p>I do not want to exaggerate, to suggest that a reign of terror has seized rural Britain. National burglary statistics show a decline. Yet in the countryside, the increasing willingness of intruders to assault occupied houses is much more disturbing than a risk of the place being ransacked when it is empty. </p> <p>Judicial verdicts over recent years in cases where residents have tangled with intruders suggest that the balance of police and court sympathy has tilted too sharply in favour of the criminal, too strongly against the householder. Today we need not new law, but simply more wisdom and sympathy from police and judges. </p> <p>It is not necessary to be a rabid rightwinger to feel disgusted by instances in which illegal intruders have invoked civil law against the owners of premises they have wilfully invaded. Legal institutions command public respect only when they are seen to strike a proper mean between the law-abiding citizen and the criminal. </p> <p>It is the apparent loss of that mean which has done such harm to the relationship between police and the middle class in recent years. When the CPS investigates an attempted burglary in which a householder has used violence against the suspect, prosecutors seem to treat both as morally indistinguishable putative criminal offences. This must be wrong. </p> <p>Judge Andrew Hamilton's remarks in this week's burglary case deserve applause not because they promise country dwellers an open season on burglars, which they do not and should not, but because they take a step towards restoring a sensible balance. I do not expect the law to offer me a right to kill a burglar, but I want its agents to display a modest prejudice in my favour if I resist. If such prejudice is lacking, then so will be public respect for justice. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "You rightly report that the new Conservative housing strategy pledges to extend the right to buy to 1 million tenants, which is seen \"as a popular measure for middle- and lower-income families\" (Tories housing strategy 'comes close to playing race card', October 28). <p>We hope it will be particularly popular with ethnic- minority families. So we were surprised that an officer of the National Housing Federation suggested the policy document came \"close to playing the race card\".</p> <p>He criticised it for saying that the effect of immigration on housing demand \"is much more significant than relocation from the north to the south of England\". This is a matter of fact. The main analysis of the figures is The Housing Consequences of Migration, published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. They show that even during the 1990s, net migration from the rest of the UK accounted for only 9% of population growth in the south.</p> <p>They conclude that \"the driving forces are net inward migration from outside the UK and natural increase, which together ensure substantial net outward migra tion from London to the rest of the south\".</p> <p>The reason for concern is nothing to do with race. Immigrants overwhelmingly make a positive contribution to Britain. The problem is that the pressures of overcrowding are unprecedented - housing shortages, water shortages, jammed roads and overloaded infrastructure. None of that overrides our obligation to help refugees. But asylum seekers are only a minority: most immigrants come on work permits which the government has boosted fourfold since 1997 to 200,000 a year. For most of our history Britain has been a net exporter of people: it is bizarre that now our population's at a record level this government should think Britain has the scope to import people on a large scale.</p> <p>Land is finite. Either we set sensible limits on immigration, or we relinquish large areas of our remaining countryside. If things continue as they are for much longer, we may well have to do both.<br> <b>Peter Lilley MP</b><br> <b>Angela Watkinson MP</b><br> <b>Teddy Taylor MP</b><br> <b>Julian Brazier MP</b><br> <b>Henry Bellingham MP</b><br> <b>Michael Fallon MP</b><br></p> <p>It would be inaccurate to suggest that immigration is the major cause of the need for homes. There are three key reasons for the increase in the number of households: people are living longer, more people are choosing to live alone and more people are moving into the country than are moving out.</p> <p>According to the latest government household projections (Projections of house- holds in England 2021) inward migration into England accounts for less than one-third of the increase in the number of households being formed within the country.</p> <p>The particular pressure on the south-east comes from the economic success and employment potential of the region. We need new people to provide essential services, if we are to sustain our economic growth.

Norwich occupies around 7,500 acres and houses a population of about 120,000. The largest city in the county, and the biggest concentration of population therefore occupies less than two-thirds of 1% of the available land area. So a new city the size of Norwich could be created without significantly diminishing the area of land available for agriculture, leisure activities or wildlife.

  "<p>We might have better pay, fewer fears about job losses and there might even be signs that we're working fewer hours - but we're still getting less job satisfaction. A major survey has tracked levels of satisfaction in our working lives and found a steady decline in how much we're enjoying our jobs. </p> <p>And the two chief reasons for our dissatisfaction are a sense that we have less control over our daily tasks and a growing perception that the workload has grown to make each day more pressurised. </p> <p>Francis Green, professor of economics at the University of Kent, says that there has been a significant downturn in job satisfaction since the early 1990s. The number of people who rated their job \"very\" or \"completely\" satisfying has fallen by 10 percentage points across the decade. </p> <p>This was a puzzling finding - as this period has seen rising wage levels and an increasingly buoyant labour market. If there was more choice of jobs and more money, why were we feeling more miserable about going to work? </p> <p>\"People are dissatisfied with the work itself,\" says Professor Green. \"It's not about the financial rewards, but the day to day experience of how we carry out work tasks. </p> <p>\"People feel that they have to work harder - not just longer hours, but more intensively. They feel they are on the go all day and that contributes to more stress. And they are recording that they have less control and autonomy over their daily tasks. There are more targets, more rules, less trust.\" </p> <p>Even if people are working hard, they don't mind if they feel they are making decisions about how they work, he says. But to have a heavy workload plus little flexibility is the worst of both worlds. </p> <p>\"These factors interact. Workers are especially susceptible to stress and unhappiness in situations where they are both pushed to work very hard and have very little control over what they have to do.\" </p> <p>Many blue collar production line workers have always worked in a routine with little scope for their own decision making. But Professor Green says that this is now becoming a bigger issue for the professional classes. </p> <p>For instance, in the public sector, in education and health, workers are under much more pressure to meet targets and to be more accountable for how they perform. He says: \"The consequence could be a high staff turnover. Disgruntled workers are more likely to leave and there's a strong correlation between dissatisfaction and high turnover.\" </p> <p>And such unhappiness is likely to go hand in hand with other problems such as sick leave and absenteeism. </p> <p>This view of work becoming more restrictive isn't about nostalgia, says Professor Green. These are observations which have been tracked since the early 1990s - and the research findings on the sense of people's lack of control over their work are \"very robust\". </p> <p>The research is based on surveys asking questions about job satisfaction to representative samples of workers across Britain - between 2,500 to 4,500 people - and monitoring how the responses have changed. </p> <p>These are asked anonymously and at people's homes, so that they don't feel under pressure to sound positive. And there are also psychological surveys to track levels of \"work strain\". </p> <p>But the surveys show that happiness and unhappiness are not necessarily evenly spread. Women are much more satisfied with their working lives than men. This is despite the evidence that they are earning less than their male counterparts - with the trade and industry secretary saying this week that women still faced \"career sexism\". </p> <p>No-one is really sure why women should enjoy their work more - with no objective reason for the difference. \"It's one of the puzzles of social science at the moment,\" he says. </p> <p>There are suggestions that women are more pragmatic in what they expect to get from work, so less likely to feel disappointed - or else that women returning after being at home with children enjoy the social aspects of going back to work. There are also age differences, with people in their thirties the most likely to be dissatisfied. While people in their fifties register the highest sense of being happy in their work. </p> <p>This suggests a picture of people in their thirties who are feeling stuck in a rut, or thwarted in their ambition. And that by they reach their fifties, they will either have shifted priorities away from work, reconciled themselves to their jobs, or else, Professor Green suggests, dropped out of the workforce altogether. </p> <p>This makes men in their thirties the most disillusioned in the workforce. But they shouldn't expect any empathy from the boss, because high status in the workplace is also likely to be matched by an irritatingly smug sense of high job satisfaction. </p> <p>These miserable men in their thirties are also likely to be bearing the brunt of working anti-social hours, as the survey provides a fresh perspective on the whole question of the \"long hours culture\". </p> <p>There has been recent evidence claiming that despite the publicity about \"burn-out Britain\" we're not really working longer and longer hours. The Centre for Economics and Business Research published findings this month saying that we're working fewer hours. </p> <p>Pushing in the other direction, the TUC says that we're still enjoying too few bank holidays in this country, needing three more a year to bring us up to the European Union average, and that increasing holidays will make us happier without damaging productivity. </p> <p>But the University of Kent research says that average working hours can be a misleading guide - and that it is the intensity, rather than volume of work, that creates the problems associated with overload. </p> <p>As an overall average, working hours are going slightly down, says Professor Green. But this masks big local differences, with men in particular working very long hours, and some two-income households having both men and women working long hours. </p> <p>These extreme concentrations of long hours are a particular problem, and distort the average, but it's no longer true to say that \"people in Britain work more hours than anywhere else in Europe\", he says. </p> <p>What is more pernicious is an unsustainable level of pressure - and he points to teaching as an example - here the government was forced to introduce a plan to reduce workload. There have been other surveys that have highlighted examples of this dissatisfaction. </p> <p>According to the vocational qualifications body, City and Guilds, there are millions of people with unrequited passions for a different job. It published a survey this summer claiming that a third of workers would like to change their career, such as bored office workers wanting to get out from their desks and find outdoor jobs. </p> <p>And echoing the University of Kent findings about depressed thirtysomethings, the City and Guilds survey found that almost half of professional staff who had been in their jobs for a decade wanted to leave. </p> <p>But it's not all gloom. Even though a growing number of us are less satisfied, these are trends against a bigger picture in which a majority of people are at least \"fairly satisfied\" with their work. And only a relative handful of people say they are completely dissatisfied. </p> <p>The survey also debunks the idea that we're all suffering from an endemic sense of job insecurity, with no evidence to support the idea that the end of the \"job for life\" has undermined satisfaction in our work. </p> <p>There are also positive steps that can be taken to improve people's experience of work. Jane Sullivan, of the Work Foundation, says that the advance of flexible working, in terms of where and when people work, can give people back a greater sense of control. </p> <p>If employers want to recruit the right staff, they need to offer the right kind of working conditions - and increasingly this means flexibility. And she says that the factors which could be used to constrain staff, could also be used in a more positive way to give them a greater sense of independence. </p> <p>For instance, technology could be used as part of a highly-monitored, restrictive work environment, where processes are automated and actions scripted. Or else technology might be used by \"knowledge workers\" as a way of gaining more freedom over working hours. </p> <p>Which suggests that if you're in a high-skill, innovative business, you'll be reaping the benefits; while if you're stuck at the other end of the employment scale, you'll be paying the price. </p> <p>Job satisfaction can be a difficult and transient feeling to define, she says, and might be different from day to day. But \"research shows that if an employer has a committed and engaged workforce it pays dividends,\" she says. </p> <p>Professor Green also has suggestions for how to improve workplace satisfaction. \"If we're required to carry out a task, without any influence over the process, then we may as well be a machine. Every task needs to have an element of personal discretion, it's fundamental to job satisfaction.\" </p> <p>He says that a solution to this could be for jobs to be re-designed to deliberately include greater control for the person carrying out a task, with such decisions using contributions from the shopfloor. </p> <p>And he says that as well as looking at pay and conditions, trade unions should \"concentrate their effort on defending their members' quality of work\". </p> <p>International comparisons show that there is nothing inevitable about moving to a more restrictive, less satisfying way of working, he says. Professor Green cites Finland as a place where an opposite course has been taken. </p> <p>But he warns that at present we're failing to take advantage of the potential benefits of our collective wealth. \"One of the paradoxes is that we live in an affluent age - we're much more affluent than 30 or even 10 years ago. And so we should feel quite lucky, compared for instance to the United States where workers are not much better off. </p> <p>\"But we don't seem to be taking that affluence and buying ourselves a better quality of working life.\" </p> <p>And, finally, if you're a bloke in his thirties who feels he is working too many hours, then at least it's the weekend.</p>",
  "<p>Though the world of work may seem light years away, the reality for final year students is that in less than 30 weeks, university life will be over and finding a job will be their major preoccupation. The most 'switched on' students will already be focused on meeting this year's graduate programme application deadlines. However in a recent survey, more than 32% of final year students and recent graduates were blissfully unaware of these looming deadlines - cut-off dates that might mean the difference between joining a career boosting, well paid graduate programme of their choice - or settling for an unplanned gap year. </p> <p>But help is at hand. Next week's National Graduate Recruitment Exhibition, taking place at the NEC, Birmingham on November 5 and November 6 (<a href=\"http://www.gradjobs.co.uk\">www.gradjobs.co.uk</a>), is an opportunity for students to swot up on the application procedures for more than 100 employers. </p> <p>\"The event is a real opportunity for finalists to meet employers and gain an indication of the job market for next summer,\" says Steve Thompson, senior careers adviser at Aston University Careers Service, which is offering advice at the fair. \"It should help students to focus on what they should be doing now to obtain positions after graduation.\" </p> <p>But turning up at the graduate recruitment fair will be only the start. A chance to meet and greet prospective employers, you should come away with a feel for the type of work you want to do and the kind of organisation you'd like to do it with. But how do you make the most of the contacts you've made at the fair? </p> <p>You need the Rise 10-day proactive follow-up plan: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Day 1: Sort through all the information you collected and file it by company name. Review your notes from the fair and evaluate what you think went well and what you can improve for the next recruitment fair or interview. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Day 2: Write notes on each employer that interests you and target five or six employers for immediate follow up. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Day 3: Do some thorough library and internet research on your targeted companies. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Day 4: Visit or ring your careers office and ask for intelligence on your chosen employers. Are there any alumni working at these companies? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Day 5: Write a professional thank you letter (\"thank you for coming to the fair and taking time to talk to me\" etc) to your targeted employers, adding any points you missed or that need to be emphasised. Make sure you address them to the people you met at the fair. Cite something specific from your discussion and include another CV, any application forms which you received at the fair or other materials you think might be relevant. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Day 6: Contact the alumni you found at the careers office and ask for an informal chat to help you get to know the company from a personal perspective. It may also uncover some informal networks that could assist your employment search. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Day 7: Take today off - you've earned it. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Day 8: Practise answers to job interview questions - you might need them tomorrow. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Day 9: This is the big one. Call your contact at your targeted employers to make sure the company received your application materials and see if they need additional information. Check on the status of the graduate intake and offer to come in for an interview or informal chat. Leave a message on their voicemail if you have to. To ensure you're not left tongue-tied on the phone, take time to prepare a checklist of steps to go through when calling a potential employer. The checklist should include a verbal introduction and a brief summary of your skills and abilities. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Day 10: Sit back and wait for employers to contact you.

  "\"Greetings from the sand box. It's dusty, it's smelly, it's hot and it's loud,\" wrote a former occupant of Camp Dogwood, the new desert base of the Black Watch that once housed 4,000 American troops. <p>It is also some distance from the so-called Triangle of Death, the lethal badlands south of Baghdad that have provided fertile recruiting ground for Islamist extremists and criminal gangs. </p> <p>After the Black Watch's troubled journey north from the British base in Basra, it might now have to be renamed Camp Incoming because of its attraction to mortar-firing rebels. </p> <p>The 850-strong deployment, consisting of Black Watch soldiers, Queens Dragoon Guards, Royal Marine Commandos and the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, is operating out of a massive former logistics base set up by US forces during the Gulf War. </p> <p>It was previously home to Saddam Hussein's hated Republican Guards, who manned the many watch-towers punctuating its 26-mile perimeter in the bleak desert wastes, west of the Euphrates river. </p> <p>The battlegroup's mission, named Operation Bracken, is to deter the criminal and terrorist gangs operating freely in the area, which in the past has provided \"rat-run\" escapes for militants from the flashpoint city of Falluja. </p> <p>Once described as a \"useless desert plot\" by an American Army journalist, the 60 by 40 mile-zone under the control of the Black Watch battlegroup is a featureless plain dotted by hamlets and villages that provide ideal hiding places for terrorists. </p> <p>Larger settlements lining the Euphrates also give insurgents ideal cover to launch attacks against bridges and main roads used by coalition forces struggling to restore order in the lawless region. </p> <p>\"It's not the Triangle of Death but it would be a huge mistake to underestimate the dangers of this place,\" said Colonel James Bashall, the chief of staff of the Multi-national Division in south-east Iraq. \"Once they know that we are there, I would not underestimate what might happen. The roads are potentially dangerous, any movement is potentially dangerous.\" </p> <p>Col Bashall was among the party of senior British officers who decided the Black Watch were able to meet the American request for help. </p> <p>He met his American counterparts for a briefing on what the Black Watch could expect to face during their 30-day operation while the displaced US troops join a major assault on Falluja, some 20 miles north. </p> <p>\"There's a different level of barbarity up there, compared to here,\" he said. \"It takes quite a long time to understand the needs of the people and the threat under which you are working. </p> <p>\"The Americans told us a lot but it's not enough until you are on the ground yourself. I think it will take the Black Watch at least a week to start getting to know people.\" </p> <p>Ryan Culhane, who spent several months in the camp last year as part of the US army's 459th Engineer Company, said the Black Watch's operation would not be easy. </p> <p>\"The weather is a nightmare for all your equipment,\" he said. \"Each time you leave the post you are putting your lives in danger.\" </p> <p>Staff Sergeant Ray Yakesh told of the daily danger from insurgents planting roadside bombs to kill unwary troops when he was stationed there last year. </p> <p>\"Night-time bomb sweeps along roads used by troops happened all the time,\" he said. \"Our mission was to go out and search for improvised explosive devices, some of the bombs were two-feet long. </p> <p>\"They would link them up to pagers or mobile phones and call the number to blow them up. The squad would have to go out in Humvees with night vision goggles looking for unusual objects or people who looked as if they might be planting bombs,\" he said. </p> <p>\"It was a great relief to get out of there.\" </p> <p> This is a pooled despatch from the Daily Express correspondent with the Black Watch</p>"
