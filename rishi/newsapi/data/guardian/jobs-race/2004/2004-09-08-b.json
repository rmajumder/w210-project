  "Forecasts of John Kerry's political demise may have been exaggerated in recent days, and he could still be clinging to a narrow lead in the US presidential race, according to a poll published yesterday. <p>The poll, by Zogby International, reflected the state of play in 20 swing states, and found that the surge in George Bush's support there after last week's Republican convention, was less pronounced than the double-digits suggested in two weekend polls. </p> <p>Those surveys, in Time and Newsweek, triggered alarm and finger-pointing in the Democratic camp, and a reshuffle in the Kerry team. But other surveys have since suggested the Bush convention \"bounce\" was much smaller and the contest remains a close one. </p> <p>The Zogby poll says the president has made up ground in many of the 20 battleground states, but Mr Kerry retains a slim lead in most of them - enough to give him a majority in the electoral college, if the vote was held now. </p> <p>The college, which chooses the president, is made up of 538 delegates drawn from the 50 states and Washington DC, according to population. Assigning electors according to the way each state is leaning now, the Zogby poll gives Mr Kerry a lead of 273 to 222, down from the past two months, but a significant edge all the same. </p> <p>\"There's no doubt that Bush got a bounce ... but no way is he up 11 points,\" John Zogby, the head of Zogby International, said yesterday. </p> <p>Newsweek showed the Mr Bush with an 11 percentage point lead among registered voters, while Time gave him a nine-point lead. But another survey by Gallup, CNN and USA Today showed only a one-point advantage. </p> <p>The confusion may reflect the volatility that follows the impassioned speeches and allegations made at conventions. It may also be explained by different surveying methods, and some of it is simply a result of polls being taken over the Labour Day holiday weekend, when many Americans are away from home. </p> <p>Charlie Cook, an experienced US election analyst, said: \"To be dependent upon getting a representative sample over a holiday weekend is enough to make any pollster wince. Polling conducted this week, after people are back from Labour Day and had a chance to digest the Republican convention, will be a far better test.\" </p> <p>US electoral history suggests that leads established at party conventions can often dissipate in the last two frenetic months of the campaign. Al Gore had a double-digit lead over Mr Bush after the Labour day weekend in 2000, but lost it after lacklustre performances in the three presidential debates. </p> <p>Mr Bush, who had not previously shown much aptitude for public speaking, surprised many doubters by avoiding serious mistakes and scoring a few points in the debates. Mr Kerry must hope to do better than his Democratic predecessor in knocking his opponent off balance. </p> <p>The Zogby results suggest the president's emphasis on his role as a wartime leader at the New York convention helped him reassert control in traditionally conservative southern states where Mr Kerry had been making headway before August, such as North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. But elsewhere the Democratic contender is holding on, and in some states - Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Washington - has even strengthened his position since the attacks made on his fitness to be America's commander-in-chief. </p> <p>Matthew Dowd and Doug Sosnik, top strategists in the Bush and Kerry camps respectively, both predict that as the race nears the November 2 finishing line, money and manpower will increasingly focus on three large swing states, Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio, which have a combined total of 68 electoral college votes. </p> <p>Both candidates have been spending more and more time campaigning there. Mr Bush is due to inspect storm damage in Florida today before heading to Pennsylvania. Mr Kerry will be in Cincinnati, Ohio. </p> <p>Both Mr Dowd and Mr Sosnik forecast that whoever wins two of the three big battlegrounds will probably be the next president. </p> <p>At present, according to Zogby, Mr Bush is ahead in Ohio by 11 points. Mr Kerry has a smaller edge of three points in Pennsylvania. Florida is a dead heat, as it has been for much of the year. By that reckoning, this election could be fought and won once more in the Sunshine State, currently being pummelled by hurricanes, just as it was four years ago.</p>",
  "Cruising into the Johannesburg River club for a round of golf, lifting off in helicopters for weekend retreats, sipping champagne at black-tie functions: they are South Africa's new randlords. <p>They spend long hours in towers of steel and glass running financial empires, but it is when they come out to play that the public get a glimpse of South Africa's first black rand billionaires, men who have zoomed from modest means to mega-wealth in a few years. </p> <p>They are saluted by some as models of what is possible in the post-apartheid era; condemned by others as the embodiment of crony capitalism, which enriches a few and leaves many in poverty. </p> <p>In the debate on whether they should be encouraged or reined in, the latter seem to be winning. The government is cooling its enthusiasm for what one minister recently called with irony the \"gentlemen of empowerment\". </p> <p>In 2003 the African National Congress introduced black economic empowerment (BEE) legislation, designed to transfer chunks of the economy to those \"previously disadvantaged\" by white minority rule. </p> <p>A decade after apartheid white people, who make up 10% of the population, still own and manage most of the country's assets and big companies. </p> <p>Reg Rumney, the head of the thinktank BusinessMap, said: \"For political stability and progress everybody agreed we needed to move black people into the mainstream economy and redress inequality of ownership.\" </p> <p>With mining and financial corporations backing the empowerment laws, barely a week passes without a company handing shares and directorships to black people. </p> <p>The pace will quicken in the coming months as all sectors of the economy, from tourism and transport to healthcare and information technology, implement their transformation strategies. </p> <p>Last year there were 189 empowerment agreements worth \u00a33.6bn. A code of conduct to be published soon should increase the number, the trade and industry minister, Mandisi Mpahlwa, said. </p> <p>But critics say the juiciest deals keep going to the same people, invariably men with ANC connections. The most cited are Cyril Ramaphosa, Patrice Motsepe, Tokyo Sexwale and Saki Macozoma. </p> <p>Beginning in humble roles in the ANC and labour movement, all four are now immensely rich from stakes in mining, telecommunications, newspapers, banking and energy. </p> <p>Ajay Lalu, an empowerment consultant with Ernst &amp; Young, said: \"Calling them gentlemen of empowerment is too kind; they are the usual suspects. BEE has become part of the inner circle of the old boys' club.\" </p> <p>They deserved credit for seizing opportunities, and their success could inspire young black people to enter business, he said, but there would be trouble if they continued bagging the best deals. </p> <p>Other commentators have been harsher, comparing the \"over-empowered\" to Russia's oligarchs and the kleptocratic acolytes of Mobuto Sese Seko who looted Congo when it was called Zaire. </p> <p>Moeletsi Mbeki, a businessman and the brother of the man who devised the scheme, the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, called BEE a device for white-dominated corporations to build bridges with the ANC elite. \"It doesn't create wealth or add value to the economy,\" he said. </p> <p>With unemployment at 40% and millions in poverty, his accusation resonates with the Communist party, an ANC ally, which has questioned why banks spend billions of rands on empowerment deals while evicting the poor from their homes. </p> <p>Mr Rumney said it was too early to judge BEE, inspired by a similar policy in Malaysia which yielded mixed results, but that he was worried black businesses might be encouraged to expect handouts. </p> <p>He said the policy could also fail because of the well-established practice of corporations using black facades to mask white ownership and control. </p> <p>Black people control less than 4%, by value, of the shares on the Johannesburg securities exchange, and nine out of 10 senior management positions are held by white people. </p> <p>Empowerment's defenders say it is the only way to create a class of black entrepreneurs after the destruction of black business and education under apartheid. And the government has made it clear that it expects the policy to nurture smaller businesses in future. </p> <p>One entrepreneur wrote in a letter to the Johannesburg newspaper Business Day: \"Despite our crippling past, I now can also have business hopes and dreams. </p> <p>\"The white minority males can now take us seriously.\" </p> <p>The columnist Christine Qunta said that those who resented the new tycoons and complained about empowerment were racists. </p> <p>\"The real subtext is, of course, that Africans have no right to be millionaires. </p> <p>\"Like their mothers and fathers, they should spend their lives being gardeners, mine workers and domestic workers.\" </p> <p>None of the big tycoons were available for interview.</p>",
  "<p>Alan Johnson left the Department of Education tonight as the long-awaited cabinet reshuffle saw him appointed work and pensions secretary and Alan Milburn rejoin the cabinet. </p> <p>His replacement as higher education minister has yet to be announced.</p> <p>The two men's appointments came as Michael Howard reordered the Conservative frontbench in a surprise spoiler move, which saw John Redwood return to frontline politics. </p> <p>Downing Street finally announced a replacement for Andrew Smith, who resigned on Monday, at 8.45pm, after the former higher education minister Alan Johnson was seen smiling broadly as he left No 10 after an early evening meeting with Mr Blair. </p> <p>But the bigger sensation was the return of the former health secretary, who resigned less than two years ago to spend more time with his family, to the post of chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, where Downing Street said he would take a \"lead role\" in Labour's general election campaign. </p> <p>The archaic courtesy title allows Mr Milburn to attend cabinet, while it is believed his electoral role would entail chairing the policy and strategy unit at No 10, as well as a role on the election committee strategy and membership of Labour's national executive committee. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Tory leader conducted a surprise shakeup of his shadow cabinet bringing back the Eurosceptic former Welsh secretary Mr Redwood and dispensing with the services of John Bercow and Damien Green. </p> <p>Policy coordinator David Cameron and shadow defence spokesman Nicholas Soames also join the shadow cabinet. </p> <p>Mr Redwood, in a return to the Conservative frontbench he left in 2000, has been given the newly created role of shadow secretary of state for deregulation. </p> <p>The return of the arch-Eurosceptic was being seen by commentators as a move to shore up the Tories' anti-EU credentials ahead of the election, against a resurgent UK Independence party. </p> <p>Liam Fox, the Conservative party chairman - who kept his post in the rejig - said Mr Howard had put his party on a \"war footing for the general election\". </p> <p>He said the promotion to the shadow cabinet of Mr Soames to shadow defence secretary showed the party was \"taking on board public concern that defence and security should move up the political agenda\" while the promotion of Mr Cameron \"added intellectual ballast\" to the party. </p> <p>But the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, said the reshuffle proved the Tories were \"more extreme than ever\". </p> <p>He said: \"Michael Howard has pushed his shadow cabinet unequivocally to the right. If there was any further evidence needed that Michael Howard was stuck in a failed past then it is his appointment of John Redwood to the Tory front bench.\" </p> <p>The changes increase the size of Mr Howard's shadow cabinet team from 14 to 17. In a move clearly timed to highlight the tensions within Labour over Mr Blair's belated reshuffle, the Tory leader said the changes would strengthen his team in the run-up the next general election. </p> <p>\"While the endless bickering between the prime minister and his chancellor has split the Labour party and paralysed the government, a united Conservative party is continuing to get on with the job of putting forward bold and imaginative policies to make Britain a stronger, freer and more secure country,\" he said. </p> <p>\"This divided and discredited government has lost the trust of the British people. The Conservative team that I have put in place today is ready to take them on whenever the prime minister has the courage to call the election.\" </p> <p>However, Mr Howard only reshuffled his front bench as recently as May, offering ammunition to his opponents that he is either a poor judge of character, or has only limited personnel to pick from. </p> <p>John Bercow and Damien Green were sacked from their jobs as spokesmen for international development and transport, respectively. Mr Bercow's former brief goes to Alan Duncan, while Mr Green's responsibilities will be taken over by the current shadow environment secretary, Tim Yeo. </p> <p>George Osborne was made shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, with his predecessor Howard Flight appointed to the newly created role of special envoy to the City of London. John Whittingdale takes over the culture, media and sport brief from Julie Kirkbride, who moves to the foreign affairs team. </p> <p>The shadow leader of the Commons, Oliver Heald, will speak for the party on constitutional affairs on top of his current responsibilities.</p>",
  "<p>The former Pentagon policy adviser Richard Perle today moved to distance himself from the disgraced former Telegraph owner Conrad Black and the \u00a3220m alleged looting scandal that has engulfed the Hollinger firm where he was a director.</p> <p>Mr Perle, who sat on the board along with other well-connected US figures including Henry Kissinger, issued a statement last night declaring he had been misled by management into approving controversial deals.</p> <p>Lord Black was last week criticised for using Hollinger's finances as a personal \"piggybank\" and accused of \"corporate kleptocracy\" involving everything from charging personal expenses such as flights, apartments and lavish party bills to signing away millions on management fees for himself and other executives.</p> <p>Mr Perle hit out at claims in the report by fellow directors at Hollinger International - which until July owned the Daily Telegraph - that he breached his fiduciary duties to shareholders. </p> <p>He said he \"cannot agree with the committee's unwarranted and unsubstantiated suggestion\" that in his capacity as an official with Hollinger's online division he put his own interests ahead of the company and its shareholders. </p> <p>\"In approving some transactions that came to me as a member of the executive committee, I had a right to rely, and did rely, on the information provided to me by Hollinger's management, including its general counsel,\" Mr Perle said. </p> <p>\"I had no reason to believe that they were failing to disclose information necessary for the making of informed judgments.\" </p> <p>The report, written by a special committee of Hollinger directors with Richard Breeden, the former chairman of the US securities and exchange commission, accused Mr Perle of enriching himself at the expense of the company.</p> <p>As the former chairman and chief executive of Hollinger Digital, which launched websites including price comparison service Shopping.com, Mr Perle received \u00a31.8m in bonuses on top of his salary. </p> <p>He was accused of breaching his fiduciary duties by signing unanimous consents without reading the documents; several apparently authorised the controversial transactions. The report said he should return all money he earned while at the company.</p> <p>Mr Perle was the only board director who came in for specific criticism in the report, although the board and in particular the audit committee was said to have provided too little scrutiny of Lord Black and other executives.</p> <p>The report's main focus was on the activities of Lord Black - who was Hollinger's chief executive until November - and his longtime associate David Radler, who between them allegedly took \u00a3220m out of the company over a seven-year period.

  "Everything is fine, the prime minister said yesterday. There are no splits. Around the cabinet table it's one big, happy family. <p>All of which was a tad redolent of Mrs Thatcher when her relationship with Nigel Lawson went pear-shaped. Blair has yet to praise his \"brilliant chancellor\", but came up with his own version of the Iron Lady's rubric to counter speculation that Andrew Smith's resignation reflected the fact that cabinet ministers are hissing at each other like alley cats. </p> <p>\"The government that I lead, I would say, is the most ideologically united that I can imagine for a very long time,\" Blair intoned smoothly at his monthly press conference. Boy, wouldn't a shrink have a field day with that sentence? </p> <p>For a start, there's the opening five words, which suggest that after a pretty fraught few months Blair feels back in charge. It is the government \"I lead\" and by implication he will continue leading for as long as he sees fit. Get lost, Gordon, in other words. Then there's the fact that his administration is \"ideologically united\". OK, there might be the odd personality clash with one or two senior members of the cabinet - no names, no pack drill - but this has more to do with unrequited personal ambition than strategic direction. </p> <p>One must assume that the prime minister had tongue firmly in cheek, because if he really believed this stuff he is as out of touch as was Thatcher during the poll tax riots in 1990. Labour is riven, not just by a personality clash between Brown and Blair, but by a fundamental disagreement over where Labour should be going in its third term. </p> <p>The notion of a third thumping victory over a demoralised Conservative opposition is, of course, an important part of the political landscape. Blair's calculus is that Michael Howard has not the remotest chance of becoming prime minister, so the main threat is internal rather than external. The fact that he has navigated the choppy waters of the summer means he is now into the pre-election comfort zone when party loyalty requires that the leader is unchallenged. In this, he may well be right. Had Brown ever seriously considered organising a coup (which he didn't), the time for that would have been June, when Labour was reeling from its dreadful showing in the local and European elections. </p> <p>Paradoxically, the prime minister's personal position may be strengthened by the recent signs that the boom in the housing market may have peaked. A poll in yesterday's Times showed that the feelgood factor is being eroded by higher interest rates; were house prices to fall sharply, the argument that support for the government will effortlessly bounce back from its mid-term trough would be far more difficult to sustain. In those circumstances, however, the enhanced risk of Labour losing would put an even greater premium on loyalty to the leadership, while at the same time allowing Downing Street to have a few private digs at Brown's handling of the economy, hitherto the most successful feature of Labour's seven years in power. </p> <p>Blair, clearly, is now seeking to exploit the tactical advantage that survival has handed to him. After a period during the summer in which success was measured by riding out the next \"worst week in his premiership\", the message is that he has come back from the summer fizzing with ideas. </p> <p>But let's put all this into perspective. Some things remain unchanged. The Tories are still a shambles but, courtesy of Iraq, the prime minister's personal ratings are abysmal and Labour is polling around 15 percentage points lower in the polls than at a similar stage of the last parliament. The Liberal Democrats are picking up support from erstwhile Labour supporters who loathe foundation hospitals and top-up fees, and for whom Iraq was the final straw. </p> <p>Moreover, the ideas \"fizzing\" around Downing Street threaten to exacerbate this situation, since the prime minister's vision of a third term is essentially a Clintonite policy of triangulation. The idea is to stay in power by occupying your opponent's territory, even if this means campaigning against your own party. </p> <p>This, at root, is why the problems at the heart of the government are not just personal. After helping Blair out of trouble over Iraq, tuition fees and foundation hospitals, Brown has some reason to feel aggrieved that the No 10 spin machine has been cranked up into top gear to brief against him. Given that Labour's domestic agenda since 1997 - Bank of England independence, tax credits, the extra investment in the public sector - has been driven by the chancellor, it is also somewhat crass of the prime minister's allies to paint a picture of Blair as the reformer and Brown as the conservative. </p> <p> But there is more to it than that. Labour will go into the next election proclaiming itself to be a social democratic party up against a ferociously ideological Conservative party, but all the signs are that the prime minister and the chancellor have different ideas about what social democracy now means. In the context of the manifesto for the next election, there are issues about the role of the state in the health service, the resources that should be made available to tackle poverty, and - crucially - the need to rebuild political trust post-Iraq. Despite the clouds hovering over the housing market, the smart money is still on Labour winning the next election. The question is really what sort of government will ensue. </p> <p>Brown's argument that two thumping election victories mean Labour should have no need for triangulation certainly strikes a chord with many in the party, who ask openly why the government is not making the political weather itself. Equally, however, they see the chancellor's failure to mount a leadership challenge smacks of a pusillanimity that has been evident in the 10 years stretching back to John Smith's death. Where Blair can at times be ruthless, the accusation is that Brown has wimped out at every opportunity. </p> <p>Brown faces a dilemma. If he supports the prime minister, he lacks the killer instinct necessary to make it to the top. If he doesn't, he is a splitter putting self-aggrandisement before party loyalty. But political calculation also explains why the chancellor is reluctant to wield the assassin's knife. It would be a pyrrhic victory of epic proportions should the keys to No 10 come at the price of a deeply divided Labour party. </p> <p>Those waiting for the chancellor to attempt regicide will, therefore, likely wait in vain. The dangers of factionalism are all too evident from the post-Thatcher Tory party and Brown has no desire to be a John Major figure. Labour's challenge is to do what the Conservatives failed to do: renew itself while in power. The question for the party in the coming months is whether it can do that without a change at the top - and, if not, what it is prepared to do about it. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">Larry Elliott</a> is the Guardian's economics editor.</p>"
