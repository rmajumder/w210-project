  "<p>Deposed press baron Conrad Black has today proved he has not lost his knack for colourful phrase-making, attacking one of America's leading film critics for \"proletarian posturing\" and \"base ingratitude\" for a $500,000-plus annual salary.</p> <p>But displaying just as much prowess in the dark art of verbal knife-twisting, the critic hit back saying he could hardly be characterised as overpaid when Lord Black's wife was paid $300,000 \"for duties described as reading the paper and discussing it with you\".</p> <p>Lord Black, until this year proprietor of the Daily Telegraph, launched the broadside on noted film writer Roger Ebert on the pages of his old newspaper in Chicago, the Sun-Times. </p> <p>His remarks were contained in a letter published in the paper yesterday alongside a complaint from Ebert about the millions of dollars Lord Black allegedly took out of the paper's finances.</p> <p>\"The recent revelations about Hollinger [Lord Black's company] mismanagement have left me feeling betrayed,\" Ebert wrote in an open letter to John Cruickshank, the Sun-Times publisher. </p> <p>\"There were obviously millions of dollars winging away to the Radler [David Radler, Lord Black's right hand man] and Black billfolds while we worked in a building where even basic maintenance was ignored,\" he added, vowing to support fellow journalists if they decided to strike.</p> <p><strong>'I do not feel overpaid'</strong><br></p> <p>Lord Black replied accusing the critic of being greedy and revealed his salary.</p> <p>\"I vividly recall your avaricious negotiating techniques through your lawyer, replete with threats to quit, and your generous treatment from David Radler, which yielded you an income of over $500,000 per year from us plus options worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, and your own website at the company's expense,\" Lord Black wrote.</p> <p>A clearly riled Ebert rushed out his riposte taking a sideswipe at Lord Black's wife, Barbara Amiel, whose salary at the Chicago Sun-Times was revealed earlier this year as part of an investigation into the paper's finances.</p> <p>\"Since you have made my salary public, let me say that when I learned that Barbara received $300,000 a year from the paper for duties described as reading the paper and discussing it with you, I did not feel overpaid.\" </p> <p><strong>'I find your ingratitude tiresome'</strong><br></p> <p>Lord Black also mocked Ebert's gesture of solidarity with the potential strike action at the paper.</p> <p>\"Your proletarian posturing on behalf of those threatening to strike the Sun-Times and your base ingratitude are very tiresome,\" he wrote.</p> <p><strong>'You trump me with your medieval persuasion'</strong><br></p> <p>That drew another barb from Ebert, who recalled observing to Lord Black on the day he bought the Sun-Times that he could not move the paper's politics to the right of its rival, the Tribune.</p> <p>\"You exchanged an amused look with Barbara. You did indeed position the paper to the right of the Tribune, in an overwhelmingly Democratic city and marginally Democratic state [Illinois], trumping my proletarian posturing with your own aristocratic, not to say medieval, persuasion.\"</p> <p>Lacing his letter with sarcastic praise, he goes on: \"But I admire you for sticking to your ideological guns in the face of the common sense which cries out that the Sun-Times naturally, obviously, and by tradition belongs in the centre.</p> <p>\"If you had been as forthright about your finances as about your politics, we might not be having this correspondence.\"</p> <p>Along with the Jerusalem Post and several Canadian papers, the Sun-Times has been retained by Hollinger, which sold the Telegraph group in July to the Barclay brothers for \u00a3665m.</p> <p>It emerged yesterday that Hollinger - which removed Lord Black as chairman in January but still counts him as a director and major shareholder - has agreed to let the peer share in the proceeds of the Telegraph sale.</p> <p>It marked a reprieve in what has been a bitter legal battle: Hollinger is suing Lord Black for millions of dollars that he and his associates are said to have taken out of the company, while Lord Black has fired off three separate defamation suits. Lord Black has always denied any wrongdoing.</p> <p>Read the argument <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/output/letters/cst-edt-vox27d.html\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "Michael Howard was accused yesterday of coming close to playing the race card in a new Conservative party housing strategy which blames immigration for creating a shortage of accommodation in the south of England. <p>In an uncharacteristically robust response to the Conservative party leader, the National Housing Federation said the opposition was playing a dangerous game by making wildly misleading claims without any substance. </p> <p>Although the 40-page strategy document - The Right to Own; Action on Housing - highlights the case for selling 1m housing association homes to tenants at knockdown prices, its claims on immigration shocked housing professionals. </p> <p>With the number of immigrants at 158,000 a year, the Conservatives claim the effect of immigration on housing demand \"is much more significant than other drivers, such as relocation from the north to the south of England\". </p> <p>But without providing any qualification, the strategy adds controversially: \"Some analysts believe that the implications of government figures on net immigration, housing stock and house building make it the single most significant factor affecting demand.\" </p> <p>Jim Coulter, chief executive of the federation, which represents housing associations, accused the Conservatives of \"coming close to playing the race card\". </p> <p>He added: \"Their comments, without any figures to back them up, are underhand, inappropriate and completely wrong.\" </p> <p>The hardening Tory line on immigration and housing, already worrying moderate elements in the party, is clearly seen as a way of shoring up a traditional vote and countering a threat from the UK Independent party, which overtook the Conservatives in the recent Hartlepool byelection. </p> <p>Yesterday's report implied that placing an annual limit on the number of people allowed into Britain would reduce the demand for social housing. </p> <p>Although social house building is the lowest for many years, extending the right-to-buy to 1m housing association tenants is seen by the leadership as a popular proposal for middle and lower income families, particularly in London and parts of the south where many are priced out of the market. </p> <p>In what has been labelled the biggest privatisation of all, more than 1.5m council houses have already been sold at a cost of almost \u00a32bn since Margaret Thatcher introduced the policy in the early 80s, with a maximum discount of \u00a350,000. </p> <p>Criticising the government for reducing the discount to \u00a316,000 - and extending a payback period for its repayment from three to five years if an owner moves on - the Tories implied yesterday that they would reintroduce hugely discounted sales. </p> <p>They also promised to give \"transferable discounts\" to allow social housing tenants to shop around for the home of their choice, rather than one they were currently renting. </p> <p>This raised the question of the cost to the public purse of providing the discounts, and the wider impact - along with an extended right to buy - on the finances of housing associations. </p> <p>Some professionals feel the strategy has wide implications for associations because it would not only reduce their rental income but also their capacity to borrow based on rental streams. </p> <p>Although the Tories say proceeds from house sales would be ploughed back into new building, they acknowledge that only one new home could be provided for every two sold because of the discounts and the high cost of land. </p> <p>But Mr Howard said they were determined to change the culture of housing, with more and more people finding it increasingly difficult to get on the housing ladder. </p> <p>\"We need practical policies to put a home within their reach,\" he added. \"Some people think the answer is to build more houses, and we certainly do need more homes, with the level of building at its lowest since the war. But what we emphatically don't want is simply to concrete over the country with millions of homes on unwilling communities.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>A conscience</strong> <br>Lucy Lytton, hydrogeologist, Oxfam <br> Lucy Lytton went further than most to get her degree - to the University of New South Wales - where she took applied geology in the hope it would equip her for humanitarian work. </p> <p>It was while working for the New South Wales state government that she got her big break. </p> <p>\"I saw a notice on the wall for hydrogeologists to go to South Africa and I jumped at the chance,\" she says. </p> <p>During the three-month stint, she helped drill bore holes so local people could extract vital groundwater. \"In so many of these areas, water is often the most important thing,\" she says. </p> <p>Lucy is now a hydrogeologist with Oxfam, heading up a drilling team at the charity's base in Hadjer Hadid, Chad. When we called, her team was about to do a pump test on a new borehole. \"Once we've done that, we can advise Oxfam on the right pump to supply,\" she says. </p> <p>Drilling new boreholes has made it possible to provide water for refugee camps in the area, transforming the lives of those taken there. Without local abstraction points, people have to rely on water being trucked around, an expensive and tedious task given the poor roads and distances involved. </p> <p>And Lucy's advice for anyone wishing to do humanitarian work? \"Get some experience. Your contribution is much more enhanced if you have gained some real experience in a more technically demanding context first,\" she says. </p> <p><strong>Travel</strong> <br>Alex Rogers, marine biologist, British Antarctic Survey <br> After a BSc in marine biology at the University of Liverpool, Alex, 36, secured his first scientific post as a research assistant at the university's Port Erin marine science laboratory on the Isle of Man, earning about \u00a311,000. His job allowed him to complete a PhD and then he won a five-year research fellowship with the Marine Biological Association. \"That was my big break,\" he says. \"It let me work on exactly what I was interested in.\" It also brought him diving trips to the Azores. As well as frequent trips to Antarctica and southern islands such as the Falklands and South Georgia, Alex has also dived in New Zealand, Bali and is a regular on research cruises to exotic locations such as the equatorial Atlantic and not so exotic spots such as the deep North Sea. </p> <p>We interrupted Alex \"genotyping Patagonian toothfish\" in his Cambridge laboratory - analysing the DNA from fin clippings to better understand the different species for fish stock management. He says his most satisfying moment came when the Darwin Mounds coral reefs off the Scottish coast were classified as a protected habitat. His work proved that deep water corals could indeed form reefs and he was an expert witness in the court case Greenpeace brought to protect them. </p> <p>His advice? \"It's not a wise move to drift through working on other people's projects. Work out what you want to do and go all out for it,\" he says. \"Having a thick skin and being fairly stubborn helps.\"</p> <p><strong>Glamour</strong> <br>Tom Clarke, science reporter, C4 News <br> Armed with a BSc in zoology from the University of Reading, TV journalist Tom, 31, landed his first science media role as an unpaid intern with National Public Radio in New York. His big break arrived when he overheard a Nobel prize winning physicist at Stanford University telling his then boss about the discovery of a subatomic particle called the tau neutrino. Three days later, Tom sold the nugget as a news story to New Scientist, his first freelance piece. \"It gave me confidence and allowed me to say I was a science journalist,\" he says. </p> <p>His most satisfying moment? \"I think that would be successfully talking for a minute and a half with out screwing up about Beagle 2's landing. It was my first ever live television appearance and I had a big fear of freezing or swearing.\" </p> <p>When we spoke to him, Tom was \"running downstairs to get a cup of tea because I'm going to spend the rest of my day locked in a dark room with a video editor and a producer\". The job, he insists, is not all glamour. </p> <p>Still, if that hasn't put you off, here is Tom's advice for budding television journalists: \"Don't ever think you're not good enough. Journalism is very competitive but a lot of people don't give it a go because they think it's something they can't do.\" </p> <p><strong>Prizes</strong> <br>Tim Hunt, scientist, Cancer Research UK<br> After studying natural sciences at Cambridge University, a course he describes as \"one of the very few in the world where you don't have to decide what type of scientist you want to be on day one,\" Tim Hunt, 61, held a string of research posts, the first of which paid around \u00a3750 a year. Life was about to get a lot rosier though. In 2001, Hunt shared the Nobel prize for medicine -worth \u00a3640,000 and a lot of kudos - with another Brit, Sir Paul Nurse and Leland Hartwell, a scientist in the US. \"My big break was actually not having a job. It gave me total freedom to do whatever I wanted to do, and I happened to make a discovery that won the Nobel prize,\" he says. </p> <p>Hunt has not seen much of the lab since being awarded the prize for research into cell regulators - he identified a protein called cyclin, which plays a key role in controlling cell growth and division. We caught him at the baggage carousel, on his return from giving a lecture in the US. \"I've been jetting around the world since 2001 and I'm getting very tired of it. I've only just started getting back into the lab and it's great.\" </p> <p>His advice for ambitious scientists? \"The really difficult thing is identifying the most important problem you can solve in a reasonable period of time. Then just follow your nose and keep your feet firmly planted on the ground.\" </p> <p><strong>Cash</strong> <br>Tom Weideg, former investment banker <br> Tom Weideg, 31, took a long route through academia before landing his job as an analyst at Bear Stearns, an American investment bank with offices at Canary Wharf in London. </p> <p>He says that his degree in theoretical physics from the University of Kent at Canterbury, followed by postgraduate work at Imperial College, Durham and Cambridge, was a perfect background for his subsequent work in finance. </p> <p>\"There are two ways of getting into banking,\" he says. \"Either the graduate recruitment scheme, which is extremely difficult - there are 1,000 applicants for perhaps 40 places - or to be an expert in something.\" </p> <p>Unfortunately, he says that the job itself was not particularly satisfying, but the starting salary (nearly \u00a335,000 a year) definitely was. </p> <p>But Tom's advice for budding financial gurus urges some caution on this. \"They shouldn't look at the salary, they should look at the lifestyle,\" he says. The relentless workload could perhaps be too much for some people. </p> <p>The day we talk to Tom, he is taking some rare time off. He left Bear Stearns several years ago to work as a consultant to the European Investment Fund and is now writing a book on finance - he had delivered his final draft the night before. </p> <p>\"For the last three years, at this time I would be sitting in front of a computer, looking at spreadsheets,\" he says. Today, at lunchtime, he has just woken up.</p>",
  "<p>Hollinger International has extended an olive branch to former chief executive Lord Black by offering him a share in the proceeds of the \u00a3665m sale of the Daily and Sunday Telegraph. </p> <p>Hollinger has asked a US judge to approve a compromise that marks a cooling of year-long hostilities between the company and the Tory peer. If the deal is approved Hollinger could pay more than $100m to the man it has accused of plundering $400m (\u00a3218m) from the company. </p> <p>Under the terms of the agreement, Hollinger will redistribute some of the sale proceeds to all shareholders, including Lord Black, who controls 18% of the company. In return, Lord Black will not sell his controlling stake in Hollinger until January 31 at the earliest. The Chicago-based company has already committed $500m of the $1.2bn sale proceeds to paying off debt, leaving up to $700m that could be returned to shareholders. </p> <p>The Telegraph Group was sold to the Barclay brothers in June after a protracted auction punctuated by legal spats between Lord Black and Hollinger. The company declined to reveal the amount that would be redistributed to investors, but said it is \"considering distributing to its stockholders a portion of the proceeds of the sale of the Telegraph Group\". </p> <p>The agreement needs the consent of a judge in the state of Delaware, where Hollinger is incorporated, before it can be implemented. If the full $700m is redistributed to investors, the former chief executive's stake would entitle him to $126m. Hollinger has pledged not to interfere with the repayment, even though it is suing for recovery of the $400m it claims was plundered from the company. </p> <p>A spokesman for Lord Black and his holding company, Hollinger Inc, welcomed the new agreement: \"We are pleased that International has agreed not to block Hollinger Inc's and Conrad Black's fair share of any funds distributed to International shareholders.\" </p> <p>However, the deal does not signal a full cessation of hostilities between Lord Black and the company that dismissed him in November last year amid accusations of corporate till-raiding. Hollinger was dealt a blow this month when a judge dismissed its $1.25bn racketeering lawsuit against the peer, his wife and three former company directors. The company spokeswoman yesterday said an amended lawsuit will be filed today and will incorporate evidence from a damning investigation into Lord Black's reign published last month. </p> <p>Lord Black denies accusations of wrongdoing and has fired back three libel lawsuits at Hollinger, demanding damages of more than \u00a3900m. The latest lawsuit, filed this month, accuses Hollinger directors of heaping \"hatred, ridicule and contempt\" on him by bringing the racketeering lawsuit.</p>"
