  "<p>The Football Association will this weekend advertise for its fourth chief executive in six years but Richard Scudamore, one of the frontrunners to succeed Mark Palios, has categorically ruled himself out of taking the job. </p> <p>The FA is hoping to find someone who can draw a line under the controversy and backbiting that engulfed the organisation over the summer and overhaul its complex management structure. </p> <p>In some quarters at the FA Scudamore, the chief executive of the Premier League, is believed to be the ideal choice to take over from Palios, who resigned last month in the wake of the scandal involving himself, England's coach Sven Goran-Eriksson and the former FA secretary Faria Alam. </p> <p>But, having recently confounded gloomy City predictions by raising \u00a31.6bn in the latest round of TV deals and having enjoyed reasonably smooth relations with the clubs he represents, Scudamore is thought to feel that the FA job would be more trouble than it is worth. \"He has absolutely no interest in the post whatsoever,\" a Premier League spokesman said yesterday. </p> <p>The FA will advertise the job this weekend in the Sunday Times and has said that it will consider candidates from inside and outside the game. Another leading contender is the former Everton, Leeds United and Chelsea chief executive Trevor Birch, who has the added advantage of being instantly available having resigned from his post at Goodison Park during the summer. </p> <p>Like Palios, Birch is a former accountant and has gained a reputation for steering debt-laden clubs through choppy financial waters. Other mooted contenders include the current FA director of football development Sir Trevor Brooking, and Liverpool's chief executive Rick Parry. </p> <p>Peter Littlewood, the Mars executive who was offered the job last year, has also been mentioned but having turned the job down 12 months ago he is unlikely to reverse his decision now. </p> <p>Possible internal candidates, including David Davies, are liable to be too tainted by association with the shambolic Alam episode to stand a chance of landing the job. However the FA chairman Geoff Thompson has insisted that the board does not have any preconceived ideas about potential applicants. </p> <p>\"It's an open opportunity for anybody with the capabilities the FA need at this time,\" Thompson told Sky Sports News. He had also come under fire in the wake of the scandal that claimed the jobs of chief executive Mark Palios and the communications director Colin Gibson. </p> <p>Since Palios resigned last month, the FA has been run by Thompson, the Premier League chairman Dave Richards, and Roger Burden, who represents the amateur game. That triumvirate is also heading the internal review into the management structure and organisation of the FA, which was announced in the wake of the summer scandal. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> David Dein, the Arsenal vice-chairman, has been appointed to serve for two years on the management board of G14, a grouping of 18 elite European clubs which represents club football in dealings involving player transfers and competitions. Roberto Bettega of Juventus has been elected president.</p>",
  "The racing industry was preparing itself to face a betting scandal that stretches to the top of the sport yesterday, after police officers investigating allegations of race-fixing arrested 16 people, including the current champion flat jockey, Kieren Fallon. <p>If any or all are charged with conspiracy to defraud, the evidence against them will have been gleaned from phone records and computer databases, and not the fingerprints on a dope-filled syringe. Its impact on racing, though, could be more dramatic than anything that Dick Francis might imagine. </p> <p>Two more jockeys, Fergal Lynch and Darren Williams, were also among those arrested, along with a successful trainer, Karl Burke. Also detained in a total of 19 early morning raids was Miles Rodgers, a disgraced former owner who was banned from the sport for two years by the Jockey Club in March this year. </p> <p>It was the inclusion of Fallon among those detained yesterday that caused the greatest shock in racing circles, however, for all that his career has always veered giddily between peaks and troughs. </p> <p>Fallon emerged as a tough, uncompromising apprentice jockey in the late 1980s, displaying aggression both during and, on occasions, after a race. He was banned for 10 days in 1994 for hitting another jockey with his whip, and soon afterwards was so enraged by the riding tactics of Stuart Webster in a minor race at Beverley that he hauled him from his saddle after passing the post. He was banned from riding for six months as a result. </p> <p>His determination to succeed made him a firm favourite with the punters, though, and his career path turned sharply upwards in 1997 when he was appointed stable jockey to Henry Cecil. He rode his first Derby winner for Cecil two years later, only to be sacked by the trainer soon afterwards following claims - which Fallon denied - of an affair with Cecil's then wife, Natalie. </p> <p><b> Out of the saddle</b><br> </p> <p> The pattern of rapidly changing fortunes has continued for Fallon ever since, with six championship seasons in the last seven years punctuated by a near-fatal fall at Royal Ascot in June 2000 that kept him out of the saddle for six months. </p> <p>Fallon is currently awaiting a hearing at the Jockey Club on a charge of bringing racing into disrepute following an undercover investigation by reporters from the News of the World that was published this year under the headline \"The Fixer\". </p> <p>If he is charged with conspiracy to defraud following yesterday's arrest, one of the great postwar riding careers could be heading towards a miserable conclusion. </p> <p>Central to the evidence compiled in the case will be client betting records provided by Betfair, the internet's leading betting exchange. Betfair brings online gamblers around the world together at a single website where they can place bets and, crucially, accept money from other backers. </p> <p>Since Betfair's launch less than four years ago, it has proved wildly popular with punters, who will usually get significantly better odds than a backer with a conventional bookmaker. However, it has also faced persistent criticism that it allows clients with inside information - for instance, that a horse is off its feed, or recovering from illness - to earn easy money from punters who are not \"in the know\". </p> <p>Rodgers, another of those arrested yesterday, has already been banned from racing by the Jockey Club for doing just that. In March, he was found guilty of accepting bets on two horses owned by the Platinum Racing Club, of which he was a director, which were subsequently well beaten. </p> <p>Rodgers was later revealed to have also accepted substantial bets on a horse called Ballinger Ridge, which was narrowly beaten in a race at Lingfield in February when Fallon, its jockey, eased down prematurely and threw away a five-length lead. It is unclear, though, whether this race forms part of the latest investigation. </p> <p>Betfair's database logs and stores every bet struck on a given race. Paradoxically, this means the site could become an important new tool in the regulation of the sport as sophisticated software is also in place to highlight unusual betting patterns, for instance when a certain client enjoys a surprisingly high success rate on horses ridden by a particular jockey. </p> <p>The City of London police, who took over the latest investigation into alleged race-fixing after receiving information from the Jockey Club earlier this year, have a wealth of experience when it comes to analysing such data, and teasing out patterns that suggest collusion. </p> <p>The racing and betting industries must wait as the investigators sift through the evidence recovered during the raids, before deciding whether charges can be laid. </p> <p>The Jockey Club seemed resigned to the likelihood that Fallon's arrest would generate poor publicity for the sport in the short term. He is an immense figure on the British turf, and his association with fresh headlines involving race-fixing, regardless of whether charges are laid against him, is inevitably damaging. </p> <p>A high-profile trial which casts a light into some of the murkier corners of the racing business might also produce a number of embarrassing revelations. </p> <p>In the longer term, however, there is a growing belief that if the club is seen to be doing its job by rooting out corrupting influences, it can only be good for the standing of a sport on which British punters gamble many millions of pounds every day.</p> <p><b>History of scandal</b></p> <p><b> February 1998</b> </p> <p>Kieren Fallon wins \u00a370,000 damages after high court jury decides he had not conspired to cheat when riding Top Cees at Newmarket.

  "Detectives specialising in tracing money deals and fraud networks launched a huge anti-race fixing operation shortly after dawn yesterday, arresting 16 people including Britain's best-known jockey Kieren Fallon and a leading trainer. <p>Further arrests are expected, possibly including jockeys racing overseas, as a team based in the City of London sift through computer records and paperwork seized at Newmarket, the North Yorkshire stable town of Middleham, and addresses in South Yorkshire and Hertfordshire. </p> <p>More than 130 officers from five forces took part in the raids, which followed a Jockey Club investigation into allegations that at least 80 races had been fixed by a criminal consortium in the past two years. The club, responsible for licensing jockeys and trainers and disciplining the sport, handed over preliminary papers to City police earlier this year. </p> <p>Fallon, whose career has been spectacular but dogged by controversy, is the subject of a separate disrepute inquiry by the club, but the scale of yesterday's raids took much of the racing world by surprise. After trainer Karl Burke was taken for questioning in North Yorkshire, his wife Elaine stood bewildered outside their Spigot Lodge stables in Middleham, her 20th wedding anniversary plans in ruins. </p> <p>\"We were supposed to be celebrating today but instead I'm being asked questions about my husband,\" she said, as jockeys Darren Williams and Fergal Lynch were also detained. \"I don't know what it's all about. He went to a police station this morning and as far as I'm aware is still being interviewed.\" </p> <p>The arrests also shocked the Jockeys Association, the riders' professional body, which accused police of \"leap frogging\" the Jockey Club's investigation. Chief executive John Blake said: \"It appears very serious indeed. The police have amassed a huge amount of evidence which they will now go through.\" </p> <p>He added it was \"very damaging to the reputation of racing, very damaging to the reputation of trainers and jockeys potentially\". </p> <p>The racing world has been awash with claims and counter-claims about wholesale corruption, with a figure as influential as Ladbrokes' chief executive Chris Bell saying in May that at least one race a day in Britain is fixed. The issue has been pursued by the News of the World, with long dossiers compiled on Fallon and fellow jockey John Egan. </p> <p>Both men deny the allegations which triggered the Jockey Club's disrepute inquiry, scheduled before yesterday's raids to start later this month. </p> <p>Mrs Burke said: \"The whole thing is absolute nonsense. It's all been exaggerated and spun. We've heard this all before.\" </p> <p>The police called on 19 homes and stables yesterday, picking up Fallon, 39, early on. He has been champion jockey five times in the past six years, missing out in 2000 when he injured his shoulder in a fall at Ascot. He has won the Derby three times. </p> <p>Fallon, who is married with three children, was arrested with two other men in Newmarket, one jockey and Mr Burke were held in Middleham and the third jockey in Minskip, North Yorkshire. </p> <p>The other 10, none of whom are understood to be trainers or jockeys, were four men detained in Barnsley, two men and a woman in Sheffield, two in Stevenage and one in Doncaster. </p> <p>Eleven of the 16, including Fallon, were released on bail yesterday and will return to a City of London police station in two months' time. The five oth ers remained in custody yesterday evening, with detectives expected to decide whether to release them overnight. </p> <p>Fallon's solicitor, Christopher Stewart-Moore, said last night that the jockey had been arrested in connection with an individual whom he met during a 10-minute car journey in Leicester following racing at Windsor. </p> <p>\"During this car journey Kieren Fallon did not speak to the individual concerned. In the circumstances we do not anticipate that this matter will be taken any further by the police.\" </p> <p>Assistant commissioner at the City of London police, Mike Bowron, said: \"This case is of great national significance, not just to the racing community, but to the wider public throughout the UK.\" </p> <p>John McCririck, the television racing pundit, said online betting had helped open up a trail of dealings which made spotting suspicious patterns easier. He said: \"In the old days the bookmakers kept very quiet and protected the confidentiality of their clients. It's good news that something is being done.\"</p>",
  "<p>The fledgling British solar industry faces an uncertain future because of a \"black hole\" in government support, an environmental group warned today.</p> <p>Friends of the Earth said two key government funding programmes aimed at boosting solar energy in the UK are to be wound down earlier than planned, with little clarity as to what will follow.</p> <p>\"Companies face a black hole in support and a huge degree of uncertainty... This uncertainty is already making future investment, job recruitment and new product development planning impossible and is sending all the wrong signals to the market,\" the group said.</p> <p>Friends of the Earth urged the government instead to extend the two schemes, offering grants and advice. Although a new scheme to replace the current programmes has been proposed, considerable doubt exists over how much will be given to solar power.</p> <p>\"While Tony Blair stands on the world stage, championing the fight against climate change, the UK's domestic solar power industry is under threat because of a lack of government funding,\" said Catherine Pearce, a climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth. \"The prime minister must put his money where his mouth is.\"</p> <p>The department of trade and industry (DTI) dismissed the accusation that it was ending the two funding programmes for solar energy as speculation.</p> <p>\"We are an island and try to capitalise on the best resources we have, which is wind and wave,\" a DTI official said. \"We just announced \u00a325m in funding for solar power in early summer, and we have not yet made any funding decisions on renewables for the next round.\" </p> <p>But the very fact that the government has yet to take a decision on funding for solar power was criticised by the industry. Industry officials said the government needed to make decisions now to ensure that there is continuity in funding after next March.</p> <p>\"It sends a hugely damaging signal not just to UK but international firms looking to invest in solar energy,\" said Seb Berry of the Renewable Power Association, an umbrella organisation for renewable energy companies. \"The industry is so concerned because firms have made decision s to invest based on what the government has said through ministers' statements and policy papers only to find that the government has now moved the goal posts.\"</p> <p>The UK lags behind many countries in Europe and the rest of the world in solar power technologies - despite the government's stated commitment to renewable energy. California is proposing to add solar power to 1m homes within the next 10 years, while 150MW of solar PV was installed in Germany last year, and 200MW is expected to be installed in 2004. </p> <p>On 12 separate occasions since 1999, the German programme has delivered the equivalent of the UK's three-year target in just one month. So far, the UK has installed 6MW and may have trouble meeting its target of 9MW - or the approximate equivalent of 3,000 domestic roofs - by next year.</p> <p>The government's lukewarm approach to solar energy can be attributed to its belief that there is limited scope for solar power because of Britain's climate. The government believes that wind power holds the most promise and has devoted most of the funds for renewable energy to windfarms.</p> <p>The government has said it wants 5% of the UK's electricity supply to come from renewable energy sources next year, 10% by 2010 and 20% by 2020. But most renewable energy experts believe that Britain will miss those targets. Renewable energy sources in the UK currently provide 3.86% of the total electricity supply.</p> <p>Despite the dire warnings from Friends of the Earth, not everyone in the solar industry took as bleak a view.</p> <p>Jeremy Leggett, chief executive of Solarcentury, Britain's largest independent solar energy company, said: \"We fully expect the government to maintain course with its current market enablement activities in solar PV. </p> <p>\"It would be crazy to create a dynamic, fast growing, award-winning embryonic industry, completely consistent with its energy white paper, and then let it whither on the vine. We expect a positive announcement in due course. Having said this, we very much agree with FoE's point about the difficulty of business planning and financing in such a climate of unnecessary uncertainty.\"</p>",
  "<p>To the roll call of corporate scandals in recent years - a list of greed and shame that includes Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and others - the name of newspaper group Hollinger International may soon be added. An internal investigation into financial malpractice within Hollinger conducted by Richard Breeden, a former chairman of the US securities and exchange commission, alleges a stunning sequence of \"corporate kleptocracy\" by Conrad Black, the recently ousted chief executive of Hollinger. Mr Breeden's report bluntly states that Lord Black and others \"committed deliberate acts of fraud, and violated civil and criminal statutes\" by pocketing secret payments worth hundreds of millions of pounds. In essence, Lord Black and his coterie appear to have milked the finances of Hollinger's assets, including the Daily Telegraph, the Sunday Telegraph and the Spectator, as a source of personal wealth, over the legitimate claims of its shareholders. </p> <p>Mr Breeden's 500-page report is alternately shocking and amusing in illuminating the scale and nature of the apparent abuse by Hollinger's senior executives, which seem to have been blithely approved by the company's directors. From claiming $42,870 for a birthday party in honour of Barbara Amiel Black, the Daily Telegraph columnist turned Hollinger board member, to the more serious charge that Lord Black and allies received cash equivalent to 95% of Hollinger's entire net income for six years - more than \u00a3200m - the 14-month long investigation supports its conclusion of \"aggressive looting\". </p> <p>Lord Black denies the report's findings, having previously described Mr Breeden as \"truly evil\" and a fascist who menaces capitalism. But those unconvinced by Lord Black's denials may be more concerned to know how he was able to get away with such an apparently concerted fraud. The answer lies in the unusual ownership structure that Lord Black enjoyed, with a holding company owning just 30% of Hollinger's equity but with a special class of shares that granted him 70% of voting rights. In effect he was - and is still, pending court battles in the US - effectively owner and manager, able to fire directors and executives as he saw fit, accountable to no one. For all Lord Black's lectures on the triumphant values of capitalism, they were values to which he seemed a stranger. </p> <p>Hollinger's byzantine ownership structure demanded a much more rigorous standard of transparency. In this case, Hollinger's shareholders were lucky to have had a small but persistent US fund manager named Tweedy, Browne that was prepared to aggressively pursue Hollinger and Lord Black. Its success, in the face of Lord Black's pompous bluster and posturing, is the real triumph. Now the Hollinger report will be examined by regulators and authorities in the US, the UK and Canada, with the possibility of heavy civil and criminal actions being brought against Lord Black and others. Hollinger is already suing Lord Black and allies for \u00a3700m in compensation and damages. Others may follow. </p> <p>Finally, there is the issue of Lord Black's title, a peerage unwisely bestowed on him at the request of the Conservative party. If nothing else this, and the example of Jeffrey Archer, shows the need for reform of the House of Lords and its replacement by a democratically elected membership. In the meantime, if these damning accusations are proved to be substantially true, it is inconceivable that Lord Black should sit in the upper house as a member of the British legislature. If Lord Black has a shred of decency and self-respect in such circumstances then he should voluntarily resign his peerage. If he does not, matters should be set in motion to strip him of this undeserved and unworthy title.</p>",
  "<p>The term \"warts-and-all\", when applied to a documentary, should typically refer to the film's subject. But Citizen Black, the new profile of Lord Black of Crossharbour, which premiered on Saturday at the Montreal World Film Festival, carries all the warts. His Lordship is the one who comes off well -- although he does have a rather large spot on the side of his head.</p> <p>The title borrows from a film by little-known film-maker Orson Welles about a newspaper baron modeled on a little-known press baron named William Randolph Hearst. The comparisons stop there. Black, for all his pretensions and ambitions, never came close to amassing an empire or wielding influence on Hearst's scale. As for Welles, his ghost can rest easy.</p> <p>From the Python manqu\u00e9 animation that opens the film to the clich\u00e9s that abound - \"he flew too close to the sun and fell back down to earth\" - Toronto film-maker Debbie Melnyk doesn't do her man justice. </p> <p>Far from giving us anything new about Black, or any insight into the media world that first attracted him, swallowed him and is now spitting him out, she trails after Black like a conflicted groupie as he conducts a book tour to promote his biography of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He refused to be interviewed properly and the film is forced to make do with his coy utterances as he signs copies of his tome. </p> <p>Particularly cringe-inducing is the attention she pays to Black's voluminous vocabulary. Instead of treating this as the nervous tic it is, she seems in awe. When a big word is dropped-- \"lugubrious\", \"pulchritudinous\" - up pop cute little graphic definitions. We learn that Mr. Black was at one time very depressed and that he switched from the Anglican to the Catholic church. And that his purchase of the Telegraph was like \"catching the world's largest fish with the world's smallest hook\". But all the bits don't add up to a comprehensive whole.</p> <p>To her credit, Melynk has assembled an army of Telegraphers past, including former editor Jeremy Deedes, one-time Sunday Telegraph editor Sir Peregrine Worsthorne and Stephen Jarislowsky, once a member of the Telegraph plc board, who notes dryly of his former CEO, \"He's in many ways a manic depressive.\" </p> <p>The film's high point is the commentary of William Dalrymple, who tangled with Black in the pages of the Spectator. Black, he says, was \"the secret weapon of the British left. He's done more to keep the Conservatives out of power than anyone else in British journalism.\" Less impressive is William Hague, who may have been another sort of secret weapon. Says the former Tory leader of Black, \"He was unflinching in his support of the Conservative party.\" Full marks there. </p> <p>Such blindingly obvious statements cut to the central problem of this film. It's made for a Canadian audience, for whom Hague is just another balding Englishman. Then again, that may be the way we see him too.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>"
