  "<p>There may be two Conrad Blacks, but there is only one David Radler - and it's fascinating to see how different the Hollinger debacle looks from Chicago, the city where newspapermen never sleep because they don't know who'll own them tomorrow. </p> <p>In London, after the Breeden report was published last week, Lord Black of Crossharbour's residual reputation lay beached up a muddy creek without a paddle. Even his erstwhile Telegraph lieutenant, Dan Colson, took a million-dollar pasting from the inquiry committee. Rolls-Royce refurbishments, private jets, mink-lined troughs for Barbara Amiel to wallow in? The noble lord was being ignobly shunted into a sin-bin alongside Robert Maxwell. </p> <p>But Maxwell had no darker alter ego, no Iago lurking in the shadows. In Chicago, on the Sun-Times and the hundred or so local papers that make up the Empire West, Black is still viewed with a certain awe while his partner, Radler, is held in widespread contempt. </p> <p>It was Radler who ran the American end - and pretty direly. He had scant idea of investing for the future, or, indeed, of building a flourishing company. What he was (those who once gazed balefully at him across an office floor now concede) was a master wheeler-dealer. If you'd got a flyblown little monopoly paper to buy, tart up and sell for a fat profit, then Radler was your man. And he could drag down prices as well as puff them up, especially if one of the shadowy companies he shared with Conrad was the favoured bidder. </p> <p>Radler came chill, curt and contemptuous. He cut, but never increased or restored. He did nothing for the Sun-Times and less than nothing for Hollinger's American reputation. He was the man that Andrew Knight (when he first introduced Black to the Telegraph two decades ago) insisted on leaving on the other side of the Atlantic. </p> <p>Does that make Conrad Chicago's favourite? Not exactly. His lordship often seemed no better than Radler in Illinois eyes. He didn't invest much either. He was in on the deals until the wheels dropped off. He gave the Sun-Times nil cause to be grateful. The only TLC around, it appeared, was lavished on the Telegraph, with staffing levels the Americans would have loved. </p> <p>But at least Black had style, intellectual presence and vaulting ambition. At least he understood editorial arguments and he instinctively fuelled a legend. His fall isn't like Captain Bob's: there's more substance and more sadness around. The ermine trail and the primrose path conflicted. It is hard, even now, to paint him as an out-and-out rogue. </p> <p>Not Radler, though. Chicago dances a jig at his passing. He left them in a terrible lurch with no Barclay brothers to mount a rescue charge. The Illinois hundred are still in Hollinger's shop window, awaiting a buyer who isn't put off by circulation scandals, Radleresque bookkeeping and a fine, feisty paper which is second in its market place (and therefore anathema to America's monopolistic chains). Native Chicago bidder preferred. </p> <p>Who are the true victims of this monster scam? Who have yet to swim their way to shore? Look west to Lake Michigan and mop your brow. Black may have been a monster capitalist in tooth and claw. But he may have pulled some of his wilder theories -such as Britain joining Nafta (the North American Free Trade Agreement) rather than the EU - down with him. He may have finished off Richard Perle, that neo-con prince of darkness, more effectively than the New York Times could ever do; and be grateful... he spared us David Radler.</p> <p><strong>Why the sudden end of Kimberly affair?</strong></p> <p>Stories die when newsdesks get tired of them, according to a world-weary Greg Dyke in that parting tirade of his. But they also perish for more obscure reasons. Consider, for instance, the matter of David Blunkett and Kimberly Fortier, which ruled the tabloid roost only a fortnight ago. </p> <p>First they were star-crossed lovers, a rather unlikely Romeo and pregnant Juliet. Then the Home Secretary was portrayed as a bit of a forlorn pest, a man who couldn't take 'no more' for an answer. And then, at what turned out to be close of play, came Michael Fortier, the rich American banker who Kimberly loved and left, chatting to the Mail on Sunday and others about the 'string of affairs' she indulged in through their 13-year marriage. She systematically 'collected interesting, powerful' men, he said. 'She is turned on by minds rather than bodies. It's not to do with sex, it's more a mental thing.' If the lady had started as Joan of Arc, she was Becky Sharp now (at least for Vanessa Feltz in the Express).</p> <p>And then silence suddenly reigned. No more stuff about pending DNA tests for Ms Fortier's new baby, no more speculation about Blunkett's high-profile trip to Tuscany to 'drop in' on Tony Blair, no more leakages from the 'pals' and 'sources' who'd kept the Sun, Mirror and News of the World well nourished. What happened? The August chiller Greg didn't mention is that everyone - participants, editors, reporters - tends to go on holiday. Thank you and goodbye. But surely we've a little more juice to squeeze here. Who leaked the yarn in the first place and kept the hounds fed? There's been some febrile speculation about political rivals, of course, summarily dismissed.</p> <p>But remember: those big three redtops know who those anonymous 'sources' were. If it was in the public interest to start publishing, then that interest demands no premature stop. Too close, too manipulative for comfort? A certain shame can also wipe slates clean.</p> <p><strong>I'll wager MacLennan will take Telegraph tabloid</strong></p> <p>Meanwhile, take a modest and unrelated bet. The aforementioned Daily Telegraph is a broadsheet and staying that way. Who says so? Jeremy Deedes, the outgoing CEO and Daily Mail ' colleagues' of incoming CEO Murdoch MacLennan. Pundits dutifully repeat that MacLennan was against turning the Telegraph tabloid had the Mail beaten the Barclays in final bidding. Therefore any compact shift is still out of the question. Tosh! And here comes that modest bet, gambling on a tabloid version of the Telegraph within two years. Why? Because the Independent, Times and Guardian will all be smaller by then. Because the Telegraph can't be left out. Because MacLennan, like his new employers, is a realist. </p> <p>Of course he wasn't in favour of a compact Telegraph if the Mail bid he helped mastermind had come through. The Mail feared - and still fears - the damage a tabloid Telegraph could inflict on Associated fortunes. Transfer 250,000 sales from the Mail's 2.4 million and the Telegraph would be way over a million again and even more profitable - exactly the game the Times is playing against the Barclays. No wonder MacLennan and Co, in their old mode, wanted to keep the paper broadsheet.</p> <p>But you have to be pretty gullible to believe that's still the case, or that those Mail ex-colleagues aren't whistling in the wind to keep their spirits up. Are the Barclays tabloid-averse? By no means. They've just turned the Scotsman tabloid and are trumpeting its success. The cover story is that the Scotsman has to be totally different from the Telegraph to succeed in the Scottish market - a claim dependent for credibility on an empire so diffuse that Andrew Neil never answers his cellphone (as opposed to talking constantly to MacLennan, his fellow Scot).</p> <p>No, the Scotsman is tabloid because the Barclays like the economics and the experience thus gained. It is showing the way to the Telegraph . Everything fits because everything is designed to fit - including the contrary spin. Why put the Saturday price up to \u00a31.20 far ahead of schedule unless you're building a war chest for the mother of all battles? Now place your bets.</p>",
  "<p>The story could hardly be more dramatic. Over 513 pages, former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Richard Breeden accuses former Telegraph owner Lord Black and his fellow executives of systematically stealing \u00a3220 million from Hollinger International, the newspaper group Black headed, over a seven-year period. </p> <p>That amounts to 92.5 per cent of Hollinger's entire profits from 1997 to 2003. Yet last week's newspaper headlines were dominated by titillating stories about the excessive spending of Black's glamorous wife, Lady Barbara. Admittedly, her shopping list of luxury items, all paid for by Hollinger, makes for good copy: the Breeden report tells of 'handbags for Mrs BB' ($2,643), 'jogging attire for Mrs BB' ($140), exercise equipment ($2,083), 'silverware for the Blacks' corporate jet' and, perhaps most ostentatiously of all, a 'Happy Birthday Barbara' dinner party at New York's La Grenouille Restaurant ($42,870). Guests, including Oscar de la Renta, Lady Black's favourite dress designer, and American chat show queen Barbara Walters, dined on Beluga caviar, lobster ceviche and 69 bottles of fine wine. Hollinger's shareholders footed the bill. </p> <p>'At least Black's choice of venue for his wife's birthday was less expensive than Dennis Kozlowski's party for his wife on Sardinia that was charged in part to Tyco,' notes Breeden in one caustic annotation. </p> <p>The fact that Breeden chose to draw a parallel between Black's behaviour and that of the former Tyco International chief executive is no coincidence. Kozlowski's lavish spending at Tyco's expense - including buying a $6,000 shower curtain for his New York apartment - caused a sensation when it was first revealed, but it was symptomatic of a far more serious and widespread fraud. Soon after, Kozlowski and Mark Swartz, the company's chief financial officer, were charged with looting $600m from the company and hauled before a New York judge. </p> <p>In his report, Breeden also accuses Black and his fellow executives - former Hollinger vice-presidents Jack Boultbee and Peter Atkinson, Lady Black, for mer chief operating officer David Radler and ex-Telegraph CEO Dan Colson - of 'looting' Hollinger International. All six hold shares in Black's private Canadian company, Ravelston, which still owns a controlling stake in Hollinger. 'The special committee knows of few parallels to Black and Radler's brand of self-righteous and aggressive looting,' the report states. </p> <p>The most serious charges facing Black and his 'crew', as Breeden describes them, relate to 'non-compete' agreements Black and Radler signed with CanWest, a Canadian newspaper group, after Hollinger sold several of its titles to the group. </p> <p>Black and Radler told the Hollinger board that CanWest had explicitly requested a $52m payment to Ravelston, a claim described in the Breeden report as 'a complete fairy tale'. CanWest didn't make the request, but Black told the board if they didn't agree to pay it, the sale would collapse. </p> <p>Breeden's exhaustive inquiry forms the basis of a $1.25 billion lawsuit filed by Hollinger International against Black and the other Ravelston stakeholders under American racketeering laws in May. That claim could now be increased. </p> <p>The case will be heard by Judge Blanche Manning in a Chicago court sometime next year, and pre-trial hearings are scheduled to begin early next month, when Hollinger's lawyers will argue that both sides should be ready to begin proceedings by the end of the year. Black's lawyers are already using stalling tactics, insisting that the case for the defence will not be prepared until the middle of 2005 at the earliest. </p> <p>Black's Canadian holding company, Hollinger Inc, could also facing a separate civil action from the SEC, America's stock market regulator, which confirmed last week that it is considering filing a lawsuit against the company alleging violations of securities law. The special committee set up by the Hollinger International board has already retrieved $42m from Black and his fellow executives and banked \u00a3665m ($1.18bn) from the sale of the Telegraph titles, the group's prize assets, to the Barclay brothers. </p> <p>The money will be used to pay down debt and some may be returned to shareholders via a share buyback. But it is doubtful that Hollinger will be able to retrieve any more cash from the Blacks, who have already squandered the money they creamed off the company. Black, for all his riches, was living beyond his means. </p> <p>According to reports in the Toronto National Post, a paper Black once owned, Black has raised $18m by remortgaging his Toronto home. The couple's Kensington mansion is for sale and their Florida home has been on the market since early in the year. No other assets have yet been traced, although the Breeden report alleges that Black may still have several valuable items of Roosevelt memorabilia, which he acquired for $10m using Hollinger money. </p> <p>A significant share of the money Black and his cohorts 'looted' was redirected to two offshore companies, Moffat Management and Black-Amiel Management, empty shell companies registered in Barbados. A further several million dollars awarded under an incentive scheme set up by the Telegraph' s internet arm was wired to two further Barbados-based companies, Argent Barbados and Argent News. But the Barbados transactions were tax-avoidance transactions rather than a clever ploy to hide ill-gotten gains in a place where investigators would be unable to find them.</p>",
  "<p>Late summer, early autumn, whatever you want to call September, this is my favourite time of year, both in real life and in beauty. It's always warmer than we think, but cool enough for make-up to stop slipping down my face, and it's far too late for summer wardrobe panic. </p> <p>Beauty-wise, autumn is by far the most exciting of the seasons, and the one to which the most attention should be paid. As with fashion, autumn is when the big beauty guns launch whatever it is they hope we will all soon be unable to live without. This means there are new products galore, and anyone with a clever eye can pick up items that will become the next beauty must-haves before they end up on the dreaded waiting lists. </p> <p>Top of my list of autumn 2004 classics has to be the new Armani autumn range. No one does soft sultry colours quite the way Armani seems to do. The eye shadows and blushers (my personal favourites are sheer blush in 8 and 9, and eye shadows in 45 and 48) are so stunning that they work on every skin tone. </p> <p>Next up is MAC, whose use of pigments is still largely unbeatable. Its new Gorgeous Gold Veluxe Pearl eye shadow, a sort of green-gold, is so beautiful it shouldn't be legal. Bobbi Brown has also come up trumps this autumn with two great new shades for its best-selling long-wear gel eye liners: espresso ink, a rich, deep brown, and my favourite, black plum. </p> <p>And finally, Chanel has really done itself proud. First, with Ombre d'Eau, a fabulous new range of eye shadows that look liquid in the bottle but dry on application, leaving colours with wonderful depth and texture (dark skins should try number 30). But it's the L\u00e8vres Impression de Chanel that wins my award for Product Most Likely To Be Copied. Neither lipstick nor lip gloss, this \"trio of make-up pads\", each saturated with lip colour, uses the principle of ink pad printing to apply colour to the lips in a completely new way. They go on counter this Monday and they'll be like gold dust by Tuesday.</p>",
  "<p>Back from a fabulous holiday in Italy, marvelled at low property prices and thinking about buying a casa rustico? Well think again - a change in the UK's money laundering legislation may thwart the dreams of British buyers. </p> <p>At stake is a very Italian problem. Buyers of property in the country traditionally face two prices - the official or \"declared\" price on which taxes are levied - and the real price, usually a lot higher. </p> <p>All property purchases in Italy are handled by a publicly-paid notary, who traditionally leaves the room for a few moments at the point when the official price is agreed. Two sets of documents are then drawn up - the publicly declared price, and the real one. </p> <p>Both buyer and seller then pay the various (and many) taxes on the declared value - which is typically 70% of the real value. So, anybody buying a house for \u00a3100,000 would declare it for tax purposes at a price of \u00a370,000. It is the vendor who pays the majority of the taxes, so they are keen to keep the declared price low. </p> <p>In Italy, this practice causes solicitors only mild concern. It is considered normal practice - indeed, under declaring the house's value is not an offence in Italy - although the authorities are now trying to raise declared values closer to the actual price paid. </p> <p>But for a British buyer, it poses a serious dilemma. If you want to use a UK solicitor - and many people will - he or she cannot ignore the real price. If they did so, they would be breaching new UK money laundering rules, which prohibit lawyers from aiding clients to evade tax, even in another country. </p> <p>One answer to this problem for UK buyers is to declare the full value, and to pay the extra taxes. And for a few vendors this will not present a problem. They are probably charging UK buyers a premium price, which will cover the extra tax that they will have to pay. </p> <p>However, if the person you are buying from has owned the property for less than five years, they are required to pay capital gains tax on any increase in the home's value. If they under declared when they bought the property, they won't want to pay tax on the full price - and in all likelihood won't sell to someone who won't do the same. </p> <p>Equally, anyone looking to buy a new build from a de veloper will hardly be welcomed with open arms at the show home, if they insist on a full value declaration. </p> <p>J&amp;M contacted several lawyers specialising in acting for UK buyers looking to purchase in Italy and almost all said the recent changes meant they now (officially) advise clients to declare the full price. </p> <p>One even said he would report any client who tried to under declare, but another said it was still possible to buy from the UK and under declare - in fact, one notary recently insisted upon it. </p> <p>Some have got round the problem by sending the purchase money as several smaller amounts rather than one lump sum, which should attract less interest from the authorities. </p> <p>It should be pointed out that under declaring its not without its risks. Anyone caught seriously under declaring is liable to a fine and to paying the avoided taxes. </p> <p>Also if the house is compulsorily purchased or the subject of any other legal action, you will only be entitled to the declared value in compensation. Lastly, there is nothing to stop you hiring a local lawyer to act on your behalf, although that could present other difficulties. </p> <p>Like we said, it could only happen in Italy.</p>",
  "<p>England's captain Michael Vaughan recently suggested that Andrew \"Freddie\" Flintoff is the best cricketer in the world. Flintoff has not heard that one but he is having none of it. \"Er, no,\" he says instantly. He bursts out laughing. \"No.\" He gives a stuff-and-nonsense look and says the best players are Sachin Tendulkar the best batsman, Muttiah Muralitharan the best bowler. </p> <p>It has been an amazing cricketing summer for England, with seven straight Test victories, and an equally amazing Freddie summer. He has scored a half-century or more in every Test, taken wickets regularly despite his ankle injury and is up for all three of cricket's new Oscars on Monday: best player, best Test player, best one-dayer. After tomorrow's final warm-up game against India comes the Champions Trophy, a mini World Cup where Flintoff will be one of the star attractions. It is a far cry from the giant pudding who nearly destroyed his Test career by eating and drinking himself into a national joke. </p> <p>Despite his familiarity nothing quite prepares one for Flintoff. One knows he is 6ft 4in, 17 stone and all that but, when he walks in, I am still shocked. Blond and bearded, he is so bloody huge that I wonder where he has left his Viking helmet. His feet look like tiny adjuncts; he takes only a size 12. </p> <p>We meet in Cheshire at the office of his agent, the former England batsman Neil Fairbrother. Before the big man arrives, Fairbrother talks about him with pride and affection. The stories he tells are of Fred the man not Fred the cricketer. He would not dare tell them in front of him for fear of embarrassing him. </p> <p>I congratulate Flintoff on his season. \"Cheers, thanks. It's been all right, yeah,\" he says. \"Can't complain, been good fun.\" He apologises for being knackered; he had a night out with his manager Chubby Chandler on Wednesday and spent Thursday fly-fishing. \"I caught three trout.\" Well done, I say. \"It was a stocked lake,\" he says, \"so you can't really miss.\" Although he is larger than life, there is a sweetness, a shyness to Flintoff. Players say he livens up the England dressing room but it is probably more by his presence than by anything he says or does. </p> <p>Flintoff grew up in Blackpool and captained the Lancashire Under-11s. He came from a cricketing family. His father, now in his mid-50s, still turns out for a league team when called upon and his older brother holds the record for highest score in the Preston local league. Freddie was playing for the Lancashire second team by the time he was 15 and decided there was not much point in staying on for A levels because he already knew what he wanted to do with life. </p> <p>What was he like at school? \"I was all right, yeah, believe it or not. Nobody believes me.\" How many GCSEs did he get? \"Nine.\" Nine, I say, surprised. After all, Flintoff is often portrayed as a noble savage. He bursts out laughing: \"Ehehehehehehehahahaha! That's the reaction I normally get.\" His deep bass rises to a squeak. He played chess, too, for Lancashire when he was 11, and his brother played for England. Perhaps we should out you as a clever sod? \"No, might be bad for the image, that,\" he says. </p> <p>When he arrived at Lancashire as a 16-year-old professional he was as tall as he is today and thin as a rake, he says. So what happened? \"I ballooned.\" How? \"I always ate a lot when I was skinny and I think it caught up on me. And I drank a bit as well,\" he says bashfully. His drinking is legendary. </p> <p>I show him an article from the Sydney Morning Herald. Flintoff is regarded by the Australians as an honorary Aussie who can play and drink as hard as they can. His Lancashire colleague Stuart Law, who is Australian, is quoted as saying: \"He'd give David Boon's 52 cans a real nudge on the London to Melbourne trip. I reckon he'd do it quite easily. I've had a few nights out with him and, when you come in the next morning and the boys ask what did you do last night, it's 'well, I got freddied'.\" </p> <p>As I read it to him, he mutters, \"Cheers Stu.\" So does he think he could break the 52-tin record? \"I don't know about that. That's a lot of ale that is.\" He is not ruling it out, though. </p> <p>Flintoff looks fit and healthy today, so different from a few years ago. Back then, he says he was simply doing what so many young men do - pub, curry, late nights. What time would a typical night out start? \"A night out? Probably start in the afternoon about two, and just go through.\" Even if he did not go out, he would probably order himself a curry for tea. \"When you're living on your own or with a mate it's easier to get something brought round rather than going to Sainsbury's and going through the Too-Good-To-Be-True range.\" </p> <p>Flintoff made his Test debut at 20 in 1998. He fluffed it. In three innings against South Africa he scored 17 runs and he took one wicket for 117 runs. Things did not get much better. I tell him how disappointed I was in him - such talent, but one just knew he would be out after a couple of decent blows. \"I felt like that as well,\" he says. He was dropped from the England squad in 2000. \"I was just rubbish. I was lucky to be playing for Lancashire, never mind England.\" </p> <p>So how did he manage to turn it all round? Well, he says, it started with a rollocking from Bobby Simpson, the former Australia captain, then Lancashire's coach. \"I just sat there and listened. He talked about the way I was playing and at the end of the season I got hauled in by Neil and Chubby [Fairbrother and Chandler] and they gave me a few home truths about what I was doing and where I could get to and how I could get to it.\" </p> <p>What did they say he was doing wrong? \"I was just wasting, just drifting along probably for two to three years.\" Had he not been aware of that or had he been too busy enjoying himself? \"To be honest with you . . .\" and he pauses, to think it through, \". . . I must have done, I must have done, I'm not stupid, I must have done, but I probably just needed it to come from somebody else, and people I'm close to.\" </p> <p>So he sat down with Fairbrother and Chandler and they devised a game plan, first to regain form for Lancashire and then to get back into the England side. Did they work on his fitness or his attitude? \"A bit of everything.\" He cut down on the food and drink, took his nets seriously, worked on his technique and his consistency and calmed down in every sense. </p> <p>He went back to basics. \"I phoned Duncan Fletcher up and asked him if I could go on the Academy to Australia. There was a lot of training at the academy.\" Things improved gradually and in 2001 he got a call to go to India during the Test series. \"It was a bit of a lifeline, to be honest. I bowled well. I think I scored 25 runs, had an absolute stinker with the bat, but I was contributing with the ball, so it was some consolation.\" </p> <p>How tough were the tough times? \"I think the hard times were easier to come through because they were self-inflicted. It was just a case of getting meself right.\" </p> <p>Does he think he has got himself right now? \"Touch wood,\" he says and bangs the table with his knuckles. \"Yeah, I think so. I'm 26, I think I've matured as a person and as a cricketer. I think my missus has helped. She keeps me in check but that's good, to be honest.\" </p> <p>He lives with his fianc\u00e9e Rachel in Cheshire. They are expecting their first child and are planning to marry next year. In so many ways, he says, he feels as if he has been given a second chance. \"In everything, yeah - in personal life, and in cricket. Pretty much what happened before, I just drawn a line under it because I feel I'm a different person, a different player.\" </p> <p>But he can draw a line under part one of his Test career only to an extent. Despite his phenomenal 18 months, averaging well over 50 with the bat and less than 26 per wicket, his averages with bat and ball have still risen only from appalling to mediocre. He laughs and says averages have never been his priority. </p> <p>\"Rather than averages I like to look at the end of the season at how many games you've influenced or how many you've helped to win. Averages can be misleading. You score runs in the second innings of a dead game or you score runs when you get beat.\" He has a point and it is great to see a selfless cricketer but even so ... \"Well, it is getting up there,\" he protests. \"If I play till I'm 60 I might average 45.\" </p> <p>He says one of the main reasons for England's success has been the leadership of Michael Vaughan. \"There's a lot of enjoyment in that side now, it's just like 11 blokes having a game of cricket.\" Is that a change? \"Yes,obviously winning helps the pleasure angle. But, when Vaughany came in, that helped me as well. He had a word and told me to do what I do, play the way I play and encouraged me to express myself. Nasser was a good captain. He turned it round a little bit and then Vaughany inherited more or less Nasser's side. Obviously they are different players. Nasser is animated and obviously very passionate while Vaughany just sits back a bit more and lets everybody get on with it. He has a laugh with the lads. He's a good fella.\" </p> <p>Would Flintoff like to captain England? His eyes light up. \"Yeah. I captained Lancashire Under-11 and England Under-19s . . . and I did two Twenty20 games this summer and I didn't have a clue!\" Would he be a good skipper? \"I don't know, to be honest. I'd like to think so.\" He says the important thing is to be true to yourself. \"That's what Vaughany's done so well, he's still himself. I'd love to have a go but at the moment I've got enough on my plate and we're all enjoying playing under Michael.\" Anyway, he says, he has more immediate ambitions. \"I want to be a good father. Aye, I want to be a good one of those. And in cricket, I want to win the Ashes and win the World Cup.\" </p> <p>Over the past year Flintoff has become a popular hero. I ask him how aware he is of it. He ums and ahs and says yes, he knows he is more popular than he was, and it is great, but he is still the same old Freddie with the same old mates, enjoying a Guinness and black (\"I get a bit of stick for the blackcurrant\") - just one of the lads. He is not going to do anything daft like start to think he is the world's best cricketer or a celebrity or go teetotal. Things are as they always were. His mother, his missus and his grandparents still call him Andrew and that is the way he likes it. \"I think it would be strange if my mum or my missus started calling me Fred.\" </p> <p>Before Flintoff arrived, Fairbrother said he had just received a call from a man whose wife has multiple sclerosis and he wanted to get in touch with Flintoff. Fairbrother asked him why and the man told him because at The Oval at the beginning of the final day a few of the players, Freddie included, went to talk to them, then eight hours later, after Flintoff had won the man-of-the-series award, he ran over to them. \"The guy said Fred lent down to his wife Karen and said 'Karen, I'd like you to have my man-of-the-series champagne', and the bloke was in tears at the end of the phone telling me.\" </p> <p>I mention the story to Flintoff and he shrugs it off. \"I was walking round the ground and I had a bottle of champagne in my hand and it was either going to get aimlessly sprayed at someone ... and I just saw 'em, so I thought you'll probably put it to better use than pouring it on Steve Harmison's head.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lord Black's woes deepened again last night when a Canadian judge ordered an inquiry into Hollinger Inc, the Toronto-listed company through which the press baron controls his newspaper empire. </p> <p>Hollinger Inc said the Ontario superior court had ordered the inquiry at the request of one of the company's shareholders, Catalyst Fund General Partner. The judge, Colin Campbell, said he would publish the reasons for his decision before September 15. </p> <p>The ruling comes just three days after the publication of a scathing internal report into Hollinger International, the business that until recently owned the Telegraph titles. </p> <p>The internal inquiry claimed Lord Black and associates had looted Hollinger International of $400m (\u00a3220m) to feed a \"ravenous appetite for cash\". US authorities are also said to be investigating the finances of Hollinger International and allegations made against Lord Black. Hollinger International has sued Lord Black and others for $1.25bn. Lord Black has repeatedly denied all allegations made against him. </p> <p>Catalyst, a Toronto investment firm, asked the court to investigate millions of dollars paid to Lord Black in 2001 which it believes should have gone to Hollinger International. It complained in a hearing last month that Hollinger Inc failed to investigate what had happened to the payment. </p> <p>Hollinger Inc said it would consider its options in the light of the latest inquiry once the Canadian court had issued its reasons for the ruling. Its principal asset is a 68% voting and 18.2% equity stake in Hollinger International. </p> <p>Another of Lord Black's firms, Argus, said last night it would miss the latest date for filing its third-quarter results.</p>",
  "Half a million workers over the age of 65 have no right to claim compensation for unfair dismissal or redundancy if they lose their jobs, the court of appeal ruled in a test case yesterday. <p>John Rutherford, 72, and Samuel Bentley, 76, challenged legislation which denies employment rights to workers past 65 and initially won a landmark victory at an employment tribunal in 2001. </p> <p>But the trade and industry secretary, who would have been liable to pay any com-pensation after the men's employers went out of business, went to the employment appeal tribunal and got the decision overturned last year. </p> <p>Yesterday three judges at the appeal court in London endorsed that ruling. </p> <p>Lord Justice Mummery, handing down the judgment, said the employment rights of many thousands of older employees rested on the result of the case, but he refused to give leave to appeal to the law lords. </p> <p>Mr Rutherford, of Rainham in Essex, and Mr Bentley, from Islington in north London, are now considering whether to petition the law lords to hear the case, or to go to the European court of justice. </p> <p>The two men had argued that the upper age limit contravened sex discrimination laws because it affected men more than women. Statistics show many more men than women keep working after 65. </p> <p>But the appeal court said the employment tribunal had erred in law when it focused only on the over-65s in deciding whether the age limit adversely affected men. </p> <p>It should have looked at the whole workforce in deciding whether the requirement to be under 65 to qualify for employment protection bore more harshly on one sex than the other. That would have shown that the difference was negligible, since the percentage of men and women workers under 65 is roughly equal - around 99%. </p> <p>Gordon Lishman, the director general of Age Concern, said: \"This judgment is a kick in the teeth for older people in work. The outcome of this appeal means that age discrimination remains acceptable in the workplace, denying employment rights to all those working beyond 65. </p> <p>\"But the government has a chance to rectify its actions. If it is bold it will deliver equality for people of all ages by scrapping mandatory retirement ages and offering full employment protection to all.\" </p> <p>Mr Lishman added: \"Half a million people are currently working beyond 65 and should have the same workplace rights and protection as everyone else. It is disgraceful that they are denied legal protection.\" </p> <p>Both men were over 65 when they lost their jobs in the clothing industry, only to discover that the law barred them from claiming a statutory redundancy payment or compensation for unfair dismissal. </p> <p>Mr Rutherford was 67 when he was made redundant from his job as a production pattern room controller at Harvest Town Circle Limited. Mr Bentley was 73 when he was dismissed from his tailor's job when Bodner Elem Limited went into receivership.</p>"
