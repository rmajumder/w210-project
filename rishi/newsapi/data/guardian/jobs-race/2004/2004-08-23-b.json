  "<p>Britain's Nicole Cooke has pulled out of Wednesday's cycling points race, leaving her pre-Athens dream of three gold medals in ruins.</p> <p>The 21-year-old World Cup winner had hoped to dominate at her first Games, but she was unable even to get close to those objectives as she finished fifth in the Athens road race and was a distant 19th in the time trial.</p> <p>Cooke does not feel she can challenge in the points event and said: \"People won't know how difficult the last week has been for me.</p> <p>\"I am really disappointed with the results but the lack of preparation means I don't feel I can be competitive on the track.</p> <p>\"I've been through all sorts of emotions and to say I'm disappointed is an understatement.\"</p> <p>Cooke became the youngest winner of the prestigious Giro Donna event in Italy less than two months after knee surgery, but she admitted she had not felt able to push for a medal in the time trial.</p> <p>\"These Games might have come too early for me after the injury problems I have had this year,\" she said.</p> <p>\"When I think where I came from, where I was three months ago when I had knee surgery, it's remarkable that I was able even to compete.</p> <p>\"It seemed like the Games were coming at the right time, but I found I wasn't strong enough to compete with the specialists in the time trial.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Matthew Pinsent was asked, in the aftermath of Saturday's triumph, if he had ever reached further down into his own resources, he thought hard and remembered a more physically exhausting race, one from 10 years ago, in which he and Steve Redgrave had needed to come from a long way back. Saturday's final, by contrast, had been neck and neck all the way, with a different kind of demand. Then he thought some more. </p> <p>\"But emotionally, no,\" he said finally. \"Nothing touches this.\" </p> <p>Those who were on the river bank to witness Pinsent's helpless tears at the end of the coxless fours final could eulogise forever, and probably will, about a race of matchless drama, a herculean struggle won by not much more than the span of a man's hand. The emotional scenes at its conclusion will also be part of the story. </p> <p>But the man with the clearest idea of what Pinsent achieved while winning his fourth Olympic gold medal was his opposite number in a phenomenally competitive Canada boat. And Barney Williams, who will report for post-graduate law studies at Oxford University next month and hopes to be selected for next year's Boat Race crew, paid Pinsent the ultimate compliment by claiming that he would rather have lost such a memorable race by 0.08 seconds than win a gold medal by a distance. </p> <p>\"There's no one else I would have accepted being beaten by,\" Williams said an hour after matching Pinsent stroke for stroke yet losing by the narrowest of margins. \"He's a phenomenal person to compete against. He's very humble. He's a very quiet competitor. He doesn't do anything brash and in your face. He just goes out and performs phenomenally well. </p> <p>\"The fact that we were part of one of the most exciting races of all time is as stimulating to me as winning a gold medal by three or four seconds. Because, if you win by three or four seconds, the race is there and it's gone. Congratulations - you've done your job, you dominated the field, thanks a lot. </p> <p>\"But this race might still be talked about. People will be talking about the fact that Matthew won his fourth gold medal but they'll also be talking about the fact that someone made it very difficult for him to do that.\" </p> <p>Pinsent knows that he will be the focus of public interest but he was concerned to share the praise with James Cracknell, Steve Williams and Ed Coode. </p> <p>\"What we did today was the product of all four of us,\" Pinsent said. \"I looked at those guys today and I needed stuff from them just as they needed stuff from me.\" </p> <p>On Saturday he had already changed his Olympic accreditation from \"athlete\" to \"IOC member\". Today he will be acting as an official observer at the canoe-kayak events, followed by a visit to the cycling. But he will be spending much of his time calmly deflecting all the inevitable questions about his interest in staying on to 2008 in an attempt to match Redgrave's five gold medals. By that time he will be 37, and his 108kg physique may be harder to control. </p> <p>He would need a month or so to think about it, he said. The aftermath of a triumph such as Saturday's, and the applause of a massive crowd of supporters, tended to push the memory of harsh weeks of winter training on the Thames to the back of the mind. And experience is telling him that the immediate future will be hard enough to cope with. </p> <p>\"I know that for three weeks or a month what happened today won't make sense,\" he said. \"My wife will tell you that after Sydney I was completely bipolar. On cloud nine one moment, in the depths of despair the next. A nightmare to be with. Losing my medal, losing my passport. Wanting to party one minute, wanting to go to sleep the next. I'm ready for that and I hope I'm ready for all the madness that will descend when we get home.\" </p> <p>Before that he and his wife would be spending some time in Athens with the Redgraves. \"Whether I talk to Steve about retirement or not, I don't know. It won't be him I'm dragging down to the river. It'll be myself. And it's a marriage issue, as well. What I do with my life affects my wife. I think she'll be the first port of call. </p> <p>\"To be honest, whenever I've spoken in glowing terms about how much I want to retire, about how I hate training on cold mornings, she's always said, 'You should carry on.' She sees how happy it makes me, in the long term. And a day like this changes your life.

  "An increasing number of white police officers are taking legal action for alleged discrimination in the wake of efforts by some forces to recruit and promote members of ethnic minorities. <p>The level of resentment among white officers has been identified during the Morris inquiry, which was set up six months ago by the Metropolitan police after two high-profile cases of victimisation against black officers threatened to damage black recruitment. The inquiry headed by Bill Morris, the former leader of the Transport and General Workers' Union, has heard that half of the 15 race-related employment tribunal cases being handled by the Met involved white officers. </p> <p>The Nottinghamshire branch of the National Black Police Association reported that six white officers were claiming discrimination after an Asian sergeant was promoted. </p> <p>In a series of anonymous interviews taken by the inquiry at Met stations, one white officer said: \"The perception is that black officers are only getting a promotion because they are black.\" </p> <p>Another urged the force to slow its drive to attract black candidates - so-called positive action - and examine the way white officers are treated. But the inquiry has also heard complaints from black officers claiming victimisation for trivial offences. </p> <p>Ray Powell, the president of the National Black Police Association, said yesterday that the evidence showed that police forces had failed to put in place policies which all officers could understand. </p> <p>\"Ask somebody what positive action means and you'll get a number of different versions,\" he said. \"There needs to be a level of understanding about the importance of a representative police service. </p> <p>\"We haven't got that yet and it's only human nature that some white officers might get resentful.\" </p> <p>Evidence to the inquiry, partially leaked in yesterday's Observer, suggests that attempts to hire more black officers in the wake of the McPherson report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence have aggrieved all sides. </p> <p>The Met has a target of 25% of the force coming from ethnic minorities by 2009, which would reflect London's ethnic mix. At present the percentage is 6.5 but the target is widely seen as unattainable. </p> <p>Since 1998 the force has doubled the proportion of ethnic minority officers but Martin Tiplady, the Met's head of human resources, said in an interview with the Guardian in April: \"If we carry on with 1% growth a year it will be years before we have a work force that is representative of the people we serve.\" </p> <p>In remarks subsequently endorsed by the Met he went on: \"If we have an ethnic minority candidate and an indigenous candidate, then we can only select on merit. We want to explore if we can recruit not just on merit, but also on ethnicity.\" </p> <p>One answer is to change the Race Relations Act to legalise positive discrimination. This is being considered by the Metropolitan Police Authority and the Home Office. </p> <p>The inquiry has also uncovered complaints from women officers who spoke of the macho culture in police stations, with porn videos shown during breaks and a lack of sympathy for childcare friendly shifts. </p> <p>The report, expected before the end of the year, is expected to recommend changes in the way disciplinary cases and complaints are dealt with.</p>"
