  "There is a striking moment in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 when members of the Congressional Black Caucus petition Congress to re-examine the 2000 election results. One by one, African Americans from the lower chamber, the House of Representatives, approached the dais and explained that, in light of the large number of black voters who were turned away from the polls in Florida, the results were invalid. <p>In order to have their grievance tabled and discussed, they needed one senator to support them. The motion fell because not one of the 100 senators, two for each state in the union, was prepared to back them. Not one senator was black. </p> <p>Come November 3, that will change. For the first time in American history, both the main candidates in a senate race are black. In the election to replace the Republican senator Peter Fitzgerald, of Illinois, the Democrats are fielding Barack Obama, 43. His only gaffe during the Democratic party convention in Boston was to deliver a speech that was so well received that it threatened to overshadow John Kerry's. For the Republicans there is Alan Keyes, 54, an ultra-religious former ambassador to Unesco who stood in 2000 for the Republican presidential nomination. </p> <p>Given that only two black senators have ever been elected by popular vote, an all-black Senate race in a state that is 73% white is a significant moment. The fact that it should happen in Illinois, which markets itself as the Land of Lincoln, home of the American president credited with freeing the slaves, is greeted with a mixture of pride and feigned indifference. </p> <p>\"Well, it's about time,\" said DuWayne Thompson, an African American in the downstate town of Joliet. \"I don't know if white people have a problem with it. But they shouldn't. We have to choose between two white men for president every time and they don't complain.\" </p> <p>Many white people insist that they have barely noticed. \"I don't think it's important,\" says Cathy Harvey, filling up on petrol in the nearby town of Morris. \"We've moved on from that now. So long as they can represent the state well, I don't care what colour their skin is.\" </p> <p>Winning Illinois demands a tricky political balancing act at the best of times. Demographically, Cook County, home to Chicago and its sprawling suburbs, dominates the state. More than 40% of Illinois' population, and 75% of its African Americans, live in Cook County. </p> <p>The state is larger than England, but beyond the shadow of Chicago's skyline lies mostly farmland and prairie. Illinois' second biggest city, Rockford, would fit into Chicago 20 times. </p> <p>So a candidate cannot win Illinois without appealing to the cosmopolitan, more liberal and more diverse city; but they must also engage the more rural, white, socially conservative part of the state. </p> <p>When Mr Obama, formerly a state senator from Chicago, kicked off his campaign for the Democratic nomination, only about 50 people attended a launch party. \"At that stage it wasn't clear that he would even get the African-American vote,\" said one supporter who attended but did not wish to be named. </p> <p>On top of that he had a name that rhymed with Osama. Mr Obama used it to connect with crowds, calling himself \"the skinny kid with the funny name\" and telling the young: \"My name is Obama, not Yo Mama.\" </p> <p>Mr Obama was in a tight race to represent the Democrats against a wealthier, white candidate, Blair Hull, who spent $29m (\u00a316m) on his campaign and was backed by one of Chicago's most prominent black politicians, the former black panther Bobby Rush. </p> <p>\"At the beginning, a lot of people in the black community didn't think Obama was black enough,\" says Salim Muwakkil, a contributing editor for the radical magazine In These Times. \"He was bi-racial; he was Ivy League and he wasn't from Chicago. White people liked him so much, they didn't really trust him.\" </p> <p>Mr Hull's campaign imploded after unsealed divorce papers alleged he had struck his ex-wife and threatened to kill her. Mr Obama romped home, avoiding a runoff with 53% of the vote in the first round. </p> <p>By June, Mr Obama held a double-digit lead over the Republican challenger Jack Ryan, when Mr Ryan's campaign also collapsed. Previously sealed divorce papers revealed that he had tried to force his ex-wife to go to sex clubs and allow others to watch them have sex. After pressure from state Republicans, Mr Ryan dropped out, leaving them four months from polling day without a candidate. </p> <p>The Republicans had difficulty finding a contender so late. Then, this month, Mr Keyes said he had \"a moral obligation\" to run against Mr Obama's record on abortion, gun control and tax. </p> <p>\"Obama has never seen a spending bill he couldn't find some excuse for, and has never seen a tax increase he didn't like,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We needed to find another Harvard-educated African American who had some experience on the national political scene,\" the Republican legislator Steven Rauschenberger told the Los Angeles Times. \"We need that because the Democrats have made an icon out of Barack Obama. The only way to fight back is to find your own icon, and that is not going to be an easy thing to do.\" </p> <p>Critics say the Republicans' choice of Mr Keyes was cynical and tokenistic. \"They know they can't win so they are trying to bloody Obama,\" says Mr Muwakkil. </p> <p>Others disagree. \"Some people think the Republicans were trying to be cute by picking another black guy,\" says Tom Roeser, a columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times. \"But the white establishment only ever picks one black guy to lead black America at any one time. The Democratic convention was Obama's coronation and now he's being groomed for the presidency. I think Alan wants to make it clear that Obama doesn't represent African Americans and there are more choices out there.\" </p> <p>Mr Keyes' brand of religious zealotry, maverick tendencies (last week he embraced reparations for slavery), and theatrical flourishes (he has branded Mr Obama's pro-choice stance as \"the slaveowner's position\"), does not play well in midwest heartlands. Nor do his Republican affiliation and anti-affirmative action stances please African Americans. </p> <p>At this stage the race is Mr Obama's to lose. A Chicago Tribune poll on Sunday gave him a 41-point lead, and 96% of the black vote. </p> <p>Even Mr Keyes' supporters concede that he has very little chance, but hope his candidacy may help shake up a moribund state party. </p> <p>\"I don't think Jack Ryan was going to win either,\" says Mr Roeser. </p> <p>\"But I think Alan is going to make Obama the issue. And given all the expectations there are now that he might be the first black president, I think Obama is the issue.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>England have looked in good form in the last year. What did you make of the game against Russia?</strong><br> It was a good test because Russia are a strong physical team with bags of experience, having qualified for the last few World Cups, and that's why Hope picked them for a friendly. There were a couple of players out injured - myself, Kelli, Amanda Barr up front - but it's disappointing to lose right at the death like they did. </p> <p><strong>Can we take anything from the game?</strong><br>We knew it was going to be a hard game against Russia, and they are in the middle of their qualifying campaign, whereas it's the start of the season for us and we've not had competitive games. That showed I think. But it was another international, another bit of experience, another opportunity to work on things.</p> <p><strong>So how would you rate England's chances for Euro 2005?</strong><br> You've got to be positive. All the players are looking forward to playing in the European Championship - I played in 2001 and to be part of an occasion like that is something that you don't get many chances to do, especially since we haven't qualified for the last few World Cups, so this is a huge opportunity for us. But it's also a big thing for women's football in this country, so we'll definitely be going into it positively. As long as we can get the main players fit, healthy and injury free then I think we've showed with our recent games that we have improved and we can compete. </p> <p><strong>How much time will the squad get together then?</strong><br> The squad will be announced around New Year, and then we'll probably start getting together and look at what we need to work on. We don't know yet what the plans are leading into the tournament, but the Germans went into the last World Cup after six months in camp, and if you're going to be competing against that... As a player you want to have as much time as possible to go through everything and work together and make sure you really get a bond between the team. </p> <p><strong>Who will it be toughest to play?</strong><br> You've got to look at World and European champions Germany - they're doing very well in the Olympics at the moment as well, so they're going to go in as favourites. You'd say Sweden, and Russia and Norway will all be knocking around as well.</p> <p><strong>The tournament is widely anticipated as the big step women's football needs in this country. Do you think it will be?</strong><br> I hope so. I'm looking at it as such, and the FA have said that they're getting firmly behind it to make women's football continue in the way it is. You can see in the last year that there is more interest, more women and girls are playing, it gets shown on telly, but they have said that this is the tournament and that they're going to make it the best European Championship that's even been. </p> <p><strong>There's a lot of pressure on England to perform then...</strong><br> Yeah, England are looking to perform well because if we have a good run in the competition then that's going to be the main emphasis of the coverage. But it's down to the tournament as a whole to show the quality of women's football in Europe, and with Germany, Sweden, France all already qualified, I think it will show what women's football is about in Europe and where the level it has raised to, because it definitely has raised.</p> <p><strong>Talking about domestic football now, can Arsenal go one better this season?</strong><br> We'd like to, you always go out with that aim at the start of the season, you want to be in the race for major trophies, but this season being in Europe puts an extra demand on everyone. For us though the league is just as important, and we showed we were more than capable of it by turning things around last season.</p> <p><strong>There'll be more clubs in the race this time out though, after all the movement this summer.</strong><br> Yeah, this season will be a lot tougher because of the amount of good players spread around at different clubs. Birmingham will be a lot stronger, and Everton have already shown what they can do against a team like Leeds, who we all thought had improved and strengthened as well. It's good for the league though and it's good for the sport - though obviously as an Arsenal player it's a challenge, and having the double under our belts means we're the team that others want to get at. But it'll be exciting. Going into a tournament like Euro 2005 you need competitive games week in week out. You don't want to be winning five or six nil. </p> <p><strong>But you do though, really, don't you. Don't you?</strong><br> No, the improved competition will benefit the league and the players in it.</p> <p><strong>Ah, spoilsport. Thanks Faye.</strong><br>See ya.</p>"
