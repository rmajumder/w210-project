  "The high court is to get its first black judge as the government steps up its efforts to change the overwhelmingly white, male face of the senior judiciary in England and Wales. <p>Linda Dobbs QC, whose appointment will be announced this month, is the first lawyer from an ethnic minority to reach the high court bench.</p> <p>Even at the next level down, the circuit bench, only one circuit judge of 623 identifies herself as \"black\", while eight others describe themselves as \"non-white.\"</p> <p>The search for a suitably qualified lawyer to become the first black high court judge dates back to the last Tory lord chancellor, Lord Mackay, who had earmarked Patricia Scotland QC before the Conservatives lost the 1997 election.</p> <p>Instead, as the Labour peer Baroness Scotland, she became the first black woman to be appointed a government minister.</p> <p>Ms Dobbs's appointment will also take the number of women high court judges into double figures, to 10 out of 97.</p> <p>It comes as the constitutional affairs secretary, Lord Falconer, unveils plans to open all judicial posts on the circuit bench and below to part-timers from next April, to ease the path to the bench for women.</p> <p>Lord Falconer has been looking at the experience of Canada, which has made big strides in the last two decades in narrowing the judicial gender gap.</p> <p>Unlike Britain, which appointed its first female law lord, Lady Hale, only this year, Canada has had women in its top court, the supreme court, since the early 1980s. Last week two new women judges were appointed, bringing the total to five men and four women, compared with 11 men and one woman in Britain's highest court.</p> <p>Plans for a new independent commission to select judges draw on the Canadian experience.</p> <p>Ms Dobbs, 53, who is divorced, is a leading criminal QC who has just stepped down as chairman of the criminal bar association, the biggest specialist group at the Bar. She has also chaired the Bar's race relations committee and its professional standards committee.</p> <p>Courtney Griffiths QC, who chairs the Bar's public affairs committee, said: \"It's a very appropriate appointment. She's extremely competent and rightly respected within the profession.\"</p>",
  "The polished young man speaking on Univision, the biggest Spanish-language TV channel in the US, might have been a movie star. Or perhaps, with his fluent Spanish and handsome features, a sports star. <p>Or he might be the next member of the Bush dynasty to take to the political stage and become possibly, just possibly, the first Hispanic president of the US. </p> <p>Meet George P Bush, 28, nephew to W, grandson of H, son of Jeb. </p> <p>\"George P Bush is a tremendous asset to the family,\" said Dario Moreno, director of Florida International University's Metropolitan Centre. \"He's obviously Hispanic, he's an attractive young man, he's articulate and he's a Bush. That's a powerful combination. It raises the dynastic possibility, and it could be a hoot if the first Hispanic president of the US is a Bush.\" </p> <p>George P Bush's TV appearance last week came as he completed a four-day swing through Mexico, ostensibly to encourage US citizens living abroad - there are 1 million in Mexico - to vote in November's election, preferably for his uncle. </p> <p>But the visit also served to remind the Latino community that he is there and to let them know that his uncle and the whole family understand the Latino experience. </p> <p>With over 6.7 million Latinos expected to vote in November's election, their votes are crucial, especially in Florida, the state which handed the election to George W Bush in 2000 by a little over 500 votes. </p> <p>With a large Cuban-American population, it is vital for Republicans and Democrats to mobilise support in the state. The Republicans have several advantages: Cuban-Americans tend, unlike most other Latino groups, to vote Republican; and they have the president's brother, Jeb, Florida's governor, to help remind them. And now they have Jeb's son to help them make up their minds. </p> <p>George P Bush - the P stands for Prescott - is the son of Jeb Bush, the president's brother and governor of Florida, and his wife Columba, who was born in Mexico, the daughter of migrant worker Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garnica. </p> <p><b> Celebrity</b><br> </p> <p>George P first emerged as a political asset in the 2000 presidential campaign, when he gave a well-received speech at the Republican national convention and appeared in Spanish-language TV commercials for his uncle's campaign. He also became a minor celebrity, making his way on to a list of the nation's 100 most eligible bachelors. </p> <p>He studied law at the University of Texas at Austin, where he met his wife, Amanda, whom he married earlier this month at a ceremony attended by the entire Bush family. Earlier this year he left his position as an assistant to a Dallas judge and spent the summer as an intern with two leading south Florida law firms. </p> <p>\"That strengthens the family's political base in Miami,\" said Mr Moreno. \"And it lays the groundwork for an eventual entry into politics. It seems clear to me that he's being groomed.\" </p> <p>George P's trip to Mexico, however, did not go entirely smoothly. He made outspoken comments about events in Venezuela, calling President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez a dictator, an epithet his uncle's administration has strenuously avoided of late, and waded into a controversy about the US border patrol's use of guns which fire plastic pellets packed with chili powder. </p> <p>\"If there has been American approval for this policy, that is reprehensible,\" Mr Bush said. \"It's kind of barbarous.\" He blamed the use of the guns on \"some local INS [immigration service] guy who's trying to be tough, act macho.\" In fact, the use of the guns is federal policy. </p> <p>But he made good use of his proximity to power, referring constantly to \"mi t\u00edo\" - my uncle - and promising that with the war in Iraq \"almost done with\", his uncle will turn his attention back to relations between the US and the countries that lie to the south. </p> <p>\"There's a long tradition in American politics of using surrogates,\" said Harry Pachon, president of the Tom\u00e1s Rivera Policy Institute, an independent thinktank in Los Angeles. \"The young Bush is an excellent example. He's very confident, he speaks Spanish. I can see him being used for outreach to Latinos.\" However, a survey published last month by the thinktank of 1,600 registered Latino voters across the country found that while they liked the current president on a personal basis, they did not agree with his policies. And the judgment was based not on issues to do with immigration, but the war in Iraq, the economy, and education. </p> <p>Although President Bush captured 35% of registered Latino voters in 2000, the survey showed John Kerry, the Democratic nominee, claiming 60% of registered Latino voters this year and Mr Bush 30%. </p> <p>\"Fourteen percent of marines are Hispanic,\" said Dr Pachon. \"The war in Iraq is not a distant event. They can make a distinction between the man and his policies. It shows that they are an increasingly sophisticated part of the electorate.\" </p> <p>That sophistication, said Mr Moreno, might find its reflection in the president's nephew. \"He shows that not all Hispanics are poor Mexican immigrants. It's a very powerful message. He represents how much the country has changed. Here's an old Yankee family that has a Hispanic in it. </p> <p>\"Hispanics see a Hispanic, but they also see a grandson and a nephew of two American presidents. They know his experience is very different from theirs. But there's a pride and a recognition of how the stereotypes of Hispanics are changing.\"</p>",
  "<p>Philanthropy is the hallmark of the great and the good, guaranteeing wealthy men and women recognition, respect and the chance to be commemorated for their great works and charitable donations.</p> <p>Conrad Black, it seems, was so keen to be up there with the likes of Bill Gates, the late Paul Getty and the Prince of Wales, that he managed to get a hospital wing named after him, allowed his wife's pet charities to be enriched and even tried to use company funds to bankroll his favourite political party.</p> <p>And while the former Daily Telegraph boss had a Black Family Foundation Wing named in his honour after a $445,000 donation by his company Hollinger International to the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, his long-time associate, David Radler, was also getting in on the act.</p> <p>Thanks to $168,000 given by Hollinger to Mr Radler's alma mater, Queen's University in Ontario, the university established a Radler Business Wing, while Jerusalem Post donations led to the naming of a \"Rona and David Radler trauma recovery unit\" at Herzog Hospital in Jerusalem.</p> <p>The details of the Hollinger donations are revealed in a report by the company's special board committee, which published its findings today after more than a year of investigations.</p> <p>The report alleges that Lord Black and his columnist wife, Barbara Amiel, used the Telegraph's money to support their favourite causes, sometimes putting strain on the rules governing the company's donations.</p> <p>Internal correspondence showed that Lord Black was keen to have the company's charitable donations increased as part of a drive to appear philanthropic.</p> <p>\"I don't want to encourage freeloading but we aren't exactly bucking for the Prince of Wales prize for philanthropic excess as it is,\" he wrote.</p> <p>In one incident, Amiel was told there was not enough money to bankroll a pledge to Elton John following one of his lavish summer parties. She responded by firing off a letter to her husband's secretary demanding that a cheque was prepared for the \u00a310,000 plus she required. </p> <p>The company's charitable donations were channelled through two bodies. One, the \"chairman's budget\" - known internally as the \"chairman's slush fund\" - to indulge Conrad Black's favourite charity interests, and the other, the Telegraph's charity committee, to administer the remaining gifts.</p> <p>The report says that on two occasions Lord Black was restrained by his righthand man Dan Colson, the Telegraph's chief executive, over his use of the charity budget.</p> <p>When Lord Black wanted to give money to the Conservative party's \"pension fund for agents\", Mr Colson warned that the proposed beneficiary was off limits for donations under company guidelines.</p> <p>\"I would strongly suggest that the Telegraph does not donate the [$800] you have requested,\" Mr Colson wrote in an email, the report says. After receiving this email, Lord Black apparently made the donation in a personal capacity.</p> <p>The report also calls into question the role of Amiel, who was not a director of the Telegraph group but enjoyed access to the paper as the chairman's wife and a columnist.</p> <p>In March 2000, for example, her assistant wrote that she \"asked if the chairman's slush fund could give [$1,500] - [$2,300] to the Almeida [Theatre] for the Gala on 4th May. </p> <p>\"She is aware that The Telegraph has already given money to The Almeida but she just wanted to make a further donation to the Gala as she is on the committee.\"</p> <p>Lord Black initialled and wrote \"OK\" on a hard copy of the email, the report says. </p> <p>It adds that Amiel also championed a \u00a310,000 donation to the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as the \u00a35,000 donation she was finally given to donate to the Elton John AIDS Foundation, which was made even though the company's charity budget had been fully spent. </p> <p>Upon being told that \"the charity budget [was] all spent so any money [would] have to come from Conrad's private account,\" Amiel sent the following email to her husband's secretary, Rosemary Millar, on September 24, 2001.</p> <p>\"Dear Rosemary: I showed this message to Lord B and he said 'Hruumph: Tell Rosemary I'm arbitrarily upping my private charity fund.' I can only relay this to you. He wishes to send five thousand pounds to Elton's charity. Could you do the necessary and send the cheque to Penny [Phillips, Amiel's secretary] and I'll geta [sic] note to go with it etc. Many thanks BAB.\" </p> <p>The report adds that Lord Black \"appears to have pushed for his chairman's budget to be formally increased in early 2001\". </p> <p>In a memo to Mr Colson in February that year, Lord Black wrote: \"Given the fact that there is an unused surplus of the company's charity budget and an impending overdraft in the chairman's, the obvious solution is to raise the chairman's budget which is, as far as I am concerned, more or less what has happened already. </p> <p>\"If you want to reallocate the budget from the company to me, that's fine but, especially in the light of the year we had last year and the fact that we have effectively laid off the naming of the [International Institute for Strategic Studies] Library after the Telegraph onto Hollinger, I think we could be a trifle more generous.</p> <p>\"I don't want to encourage freeloading but we aren't exactly bucking for the Prince of Wales prize for philanthropic excess as it is. Furthermore, a number of the items attributed to the chairman's budget could at least as appropriately have been shouldered by the company.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "<p>Former Telegraph boss Conrad Black led a \"corporate kleptocracy\" at his publishing empire Hollinger International, according to an excoriating report by a company special committee.</p> <p>In a 513-page document published today, the committee accused Lord Black and his associates of transferring more than $400m of company money to themselves over the past seven years.</p> <p>It described Lord Black and his longtime associate David Radler as \"the truly 'bad actors' involved in the Hollinger Chronicles\", but also criticised the Hollinger board for failing to spot the pair's \"bloated fee requests\".</p> <p>\"Though the persons who took funds or assets from Hollinger improperly are the primary offenders, the consistent inaction of the Hollinger board also resulted in squandering opportunities for stopping abusive acts before the damage was too great,\" the report said.</p> <p>In particular, the company's audit committee chaired by Jim Thompson, former governor of Illinois, is accused of being \"ineffective and careless over a prolonged period of time\".</p> <p>\"By almost any measure, their worst failing was not performing any appreciable analysis or review of whether more than $225m in management fees they approved for payment to Black and Radler... were fair and reasonable charges to Hollinger. </p> <p>\"The audit committee also passively acceded to Black's and Radler's demands when supposedly reviewing $60m in non-compete fees.\"</p> <p>Shareholders will be particularly interested in the report's comments about non-executive directors, as they could launch lawsuits against them for negligence.</p> <p>Hollinger's board includes a number of high-profile figures, including the former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger and Richard Perle, the prominent neo-conservative and foreign policy guru.</p> <p>But the report emphasised that while directors may have questions to answer about their performance, the main culprits for what happened at Hollinger were Lord Black, Mr Radler and their associates.</p> <p>In its opening remarks, the report stated: \"This story is about how Hollinger was systematically manipulated and used by its controlling shareholders for their sole benefit, and in a manner that violated every concept of fiduciary duty. </p> <p>\"Not once or twice, but on dozens of occasions Hollinger was victimized by its controlling shareholders as they transferred to themselves and their affiliates more than $400m in the last seven years.\"</p> <p>It claimed that the aggregate cash taken by Lord Black, who was Hollinger's chief executive until November and chairman until he was removed in January, and Mr Radler, who was chief operating officer, represented 95.2% of Hollinger's entire adjusted net income during 1997-2003. </p> <p>\"Behind a constant stream of bombast regarding their accomplishments as self-described 'proprietors', Black and Radler made it their business to line their pockets at the expense of Hollinger almost every day, in almost every way they could devise,\" the committee said. </p> <p>\"The special committee knows of few parallels to Black and Radler's brand of self-righteous, and aggressive looting of Hollinger to the exclusion of all other concerns or interests, and irrespective of whether their actions were remotely fair to shareholders.\" </p> <p>Accusing Lord Black and Mr Radler of a \"ravenous appetite for cash\", it said it believed Lord Black was motivated by pressure on his cash-strapped holding company, Hollinger Inc, and in order to fund the lifestyle led by him and his wife, Barbara Amiel.</p> <p>Today's report is the result of more than a year of investigation by the special committee, which was set up by Hollinger last year after shareholders queried a series of management fees paid to executives.</p> <p>The committee, which was led by former US securities and exchange commission chairman Richard Breeden, said it had interviewed more than 60 witnesses in depth, reviewed nearly 750,000 pages of documents as background for its analysis, and met on more than 40 occasions.</p> <p>Its findings have already been used as the basis for a \u00a3700m lawsuit filed in January and amended in May, which has accused Lord Black of racketeering.</p> <p>Lord Black has always denied any wrongdoing since he stepped down as chief executive in November and has launched defamation proceedings against his old company and some of his former colleagues on the board.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Fresh allegations against former Daily Telegraph tycoon Conrad Black are expected today with the courtroom filing of a long-awaited investigation into his stewardship of the newspaper empire Hollinger International. </p> <p>The 400-page report is the result of a year-long inquiry led by the former US securities and exchange commission chief, Richard Breeden. </p> <p>The report was filed last night in a US district court in Chicago and will be posted on the SEC's website this morning. </p> <p>Hollinger International has already filed a racketeering suit against Lord Black and others for $1.25bn (\u00a3700m) including damages, claiming that they looted the company of almost $400m in unapproved fees, loans, expenses and excessive compensation. </p> <p>Lord Black and others also arranged deals to buy some of the company's newspapers for next to nothing, it alleged. </p> <p>Gordon Paris, the interim chairman and chief executive of Hollinger International, said last night the report is \"an important step forward in our pursuit of restitution for funds and assets inappropriately taken from the company's coffers\". </p> <p>The racketeering suit included scandalous detail, such as the claim that Lord Black's wife Barbara Amiel had charged her tips to the doorman of an upmarket New York department store to the company. The couple also allegedly paid for butlers, cars and the personal use of corporate aircraft with company money. </p> <p>Reports yesterday suggested there might be more allegations to come. </p> <p>The report's publication could accelerate a criminal investigation under way by the US justice department. </p> <p>Mr Breeden was invited to lead the special committee investigating Hollinger International's finances last summer after a shareholder complained of \"non-compete\" bonuses paid to executives when assets were sold. These fees are often paid to companies, but rarely to individuals, for agreeing not to launch products in competition with the ones they have sold. </p> <p>Initial findings in November claimed that about $32m of fees awarded to Lord Black and others had not been approved by the board. </p> <p>At the time, Lord Black agreed to repay his share of the money and to work with the special committee. In fact, he began secret talks with the Barclay brothers to sell them his controlling stake in the business. The deal failed but the Barclays won their prize, buying the Telegraph group from Hollinger International for $1.3bn. </p> <p>Lord Black has denied any wrongdoing and filed a defamation suit against the company. </p> <p>Shareholders are likely to be less interested in the report's headline-grabbing details than what it says about the liability of the company's other directors. They include former US defence adviser Richard Perle and James Thompson, the one-time Illinois governor. </p> <p>One investor, Cardinal Capital, has already filed a claim against the company's current and former directors.</p>"
