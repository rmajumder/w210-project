  "<p>After overseeing albums by the Long Blondes and Mystery Jets, DJ Erol Alkan has apparently retired from production following this third record. It's not hard to see why; Fantasy Black Channel is a tour de force comprising glam, techno, and rave , all of which he twists into unimaginable shapes. It's hard to see how he or they could spin a more definitive statement.</p>",
  "<p>Cory Booker's message was clear. Unveiling a plaque to commemorate deadly race riots in his city 41 years ago, the young black Mayor of Newark, New Jersey, was thinking of the future as much as the past. Though 26 people died in the troubles and the city turned into a byword for racial tensions and crime, Booker was determined not to make the event about America's past racism and segregation.</p> <p>'I am of a different generation,' he told a crowd of onlookers in the stifling heat of a Newark summer's day. 'I have never in my life seen a sign, but in a museum, that says \"Whites only\". I am from a generation that came about in a different era.'</p> <p>Such honest words, wilfully breaking free from the Sixties civil rights struggle, would once have been unthinkable from a leading black politician, especially when speaking to a mostly black audience. But now, as Barack Obama runs to be America's first black President, a new cadre of so-called 'post-racial' black politicians have moved to the fore. They are changing the face of black American politics.</p> <p>Shaking off the traditional black power structures of civil rights groups and the black church, they have distanced themselves from figures such as Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. They have also posed a challenge to established black politicians with roots in the old civil rights era, such as South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn and Georgia congressman John Lewis. The new politicians have based their appeal on anything but race. They have forged voter coalitions across racial boundaries, including whites and Hispanics. And it has worked. </p> <p>Booker is a hugely popular mayor in Newark. He is not alone. Deval Patrick has become the first black governor of heavily white Massachusetts. David Paterson is the first black governor of New York. Adrian Fenty, aged just 37, is the young black mayor of Washington DC, and a world away from the black politicians that came before him. In Atlanta the black mayor, Shirley Franklin, is hugely popular with the powerful white business community. </p> <p>All of them - like Obama - have won electoral success by seeking to move beyond racial identity. They could be the first trickles of a coming flood. 'This surge of black politicians running post-racial campaigns is new. But if Obama wins the White House we are going to see a major shift towards them,' said Caroline Heldman, a political scientist at California's Occidental College.</p> <p>Booker looks every inch the new black politician. He is handsome and young and wears dapper suits. He has an impressive educational background: a degree from Stanford and a Rhodes Scholar. He grew up in a mostly white town in New Jersey, the son of IBM executives.</p> <p>Yet here he is as the mayor of Newark, a city that, for much of America, has come to mean rampant crime and sprawling black ghettos. He is now turning it around. Booker has substantially reduced violent crime. He has reformed the police force and brought high-profile companies to the city. He is a relentlessly upbeat advocate for the city despite its reputation.</p> <p>That reputation was largely born in 1967. After rumours spread that white police had beaten a black taxi driver, riots broke out that cost 26 lives, injured more than 700 and saw the National Guard brought onto the streets. It resulted in the flight of the white middle class, leaving behind an impoverished black populace. Memories run deep here. Watching the plaque being unveiled was Atno Smith, who grew up near where the riot started. 'You call it a riot,' he said 'We call it a rebellion. You can call it a police riot if you like. Or a National Guard riot.'</p> <p>Such sentiments have been common in black American politics for a generation; defined by a sense of injustice and the notion that street protest was the best way to address black concerns. The TV image of Sharpton and Jackson leading a march to protest at a police shooting or a racially motivated murder has become a cultural signpost for modern American life. But Obama, Booker and others are seeking to change that. </p> <p>In his memorial speech, Booker outlined a post-racial future for black Americans and his constant theme was to move on from the civil rights era. 'We do not want these stories or these memories to overcome us and undermine us; to trap us in our history,' he said.</p> <p>That echoes the themes of Obama, who only openly addressed the issue of race when his pastor, the Rev Jeremiah Wright, became a damaging campaign issue after making comments including blaming America for the 11 September attacks and claiming the government had secretly invented HIV 'as a means of genocide against people of colour'. </p> <p>Indeed, Obama has been frequently at pains to call on black Americans to take responsibility for their lives. He has spoken at black churches and aggressively pushed the need for individual blacks, especially young fathers, to look after their families better. That theme has earned the ire of older figures such as Jackson, whose fury at Obama recently spilled out when a microphone in a TV studio picked up Jackson admitting he wanted to '... cut his nuts out'.</p> <p>The new generation of black politicians has forged on regardless and, to some extent, they have succeeded in removing race from their campaigns. When Paterson replaced Eliot Spitzer as New York's governor, much was made of the fact Paterson was blind. His race was rarely mentioned. Patrick and Franklin's paths to power unfolded in similar ways, with race playing little overt role. </p> <p>In many ways, these politicians reflect the emergence of a black middle class that has moved to the same suburbs as their white counterparts and works in the same professional jobs. A recent study for Radio One, a black broadcasting company, found huge generational discrepancies among black Americans. It found younger blacks in their thirties and forties were twice as likely to say society focused too much on black oppression as their parents' generation. They were also markedly more optimistic about the future.</p> <p>That attitude can be found even on the streets of Newark where the riots began. William Steele, who is black, said Booker had the right message: 'Cory Booker is just laying it out there. That what we need to do is just stand up. He is giving people a sense of responsibility that if you want some money, then you have to get out there and get a job. It does not matter if you are black or white.'</p> <p>It is not as easy as that. The truth is far more complex than a flood of newspaper headlines greeting the premature dawn of a non-racial future.</p> <p>It is certainly easy to find dissenting Newark voices, who believe the new black politicians are abandoning the real concerns of black people. Opposite the police station on which the memorial plaque now hangs, a large estate of new housing has been built. The area used to be a notorious 'project' but is now full of smart, tidy homes. To many that is a sign of progress, but not for Theresa Manning. She says Booker - and black politicians like him - have forgotten the poorest of the poor in her city in favour of embryonic gentrification. </p> <p>'They knock down a project where we live and then build these new houses. But we can't afford to live in them,' she said 'They are trying to [push] us out of Newark. But where we gonna go?'</p> <p>There is a fear that the declining influence of old-style black protest politics will mean the new black politicians will be able to ignore disadvantaged black communities or blame them for their own situation. But the fact is that black America is a very different world from the rest of the US. </p> <p>On average, black American men live seven years less than other racial groups. They are five times more likely to die of Aids. More than three times as many blacks live in prison cells than live in university halls. Many experts fear that electing Obama - or other political leaders - on a 'non-racial' basis would allow these issues to be swept under the carpet. 'There is a sense that this might be the potential downside of the triumph of tokenism,' said Devin Fergus, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University. </p> <p>Given the nature of the problems still facing black America, many black commentators believe there is still a justification for the confrontational, race-based politics of old hands such as Sharpton and Jackson. Indeed, it was noticeable in Obama's epic nomination battle with Hillary Clinton that establishment black politicians were far cooler about Obama than the black Democratic electorate. Many older black mayors, congressmen and senators ended up firmly in the Clinton camp or stayed on the sidelines until near the very end. 'People are worried that these post-racial politicians will not be able to forcibly address real black issues,' said Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Emory University who is writing a book on Booker.</p> <p>On the streets of America's inner cities, that same sentiment can be found, albeit expressed in simpler language. It often takes the form of a resentment of the education of the new black politicians and a belief that they do not understand what it means to be black in America. Obama has come under sustained criticism for his Hawaiian upbringing and his Kenyan - not black American - family background. Even in Newark, Booker is not immune. Manning is not shy about attacking what she sees as Booker's privileged upbringing in a wealthy white suburb. The vehemence of her words, delivered on a street corner as Booker prepared to get back in his SUV, jarred starkly with the positive post-racial rhetoric of the mayor's speech. 'Cory Booker did not know what it means to be black. He had to learn how to be black,' Manning said.</p> <p>Her words perhaps deliberately echoed a famous campaign taunt used by Booker's predecessor as mayor, Sharpe James. James, who ran Newark for two decades as a classic old-school black politician, once said of Booker: 'You have to learn how to be African-American and we don't have time to train you.' But how times have changed. Booker is now mayor and James has been jailed on corruption charges.</p> <p>In many black intellectual circles there is now a fierce argument over whether the new 'post-racial' campaigns are simply a means to an end - that sacrificing black identity politics will allow black leaders to better tackle racial injustice. Or are they, paradoxically, a bad thing for many poor black communities whose concerns could be abandoned.</p> <p>The jury is out. Critics say politicians such as Booker and Obama, by raising issues such as absent black fathers, are pandering to the racism of the white majority in order to win office. 'Some think the election of Obama could be a double-edged sword. Some of what he has said could give strength to those who falsely argue black Americans are marginalised by their own choices,' Fergus said. </p> <p>But others say the opposite. They say the new generation of black politicians simply want to make all their constituents' lives better and move beyond race. Getting elected first is key, they argue, because only then can they push for social change. 'It's only in office that black leaders can then begin to legislate,' Gillespie said.</p> <p>Perhaps an answer will emerge only if Obama wins the White House. That is a real possibility, undreamed of even two decades ago. But then America's racial politics are changing. Certainly few people 41 years ago, during the race riots in Newark, would have imagined that the first mayor to produce a memorial to them would be like Cory Booker: young, black, popular with whites and loved by the police. There are even whispers of much bigger things ahead in his political future. Even Manning had good words for the impact the mayor has had on a city that desperately needed help: 'I'll say this for Cory Booker. There isn't drugs being sold outside my house any more. I appreciate that.'</p>",
  "<p>If Durham do go on to win their first County Championship title in September, they may reflect upon the past four days with fond memories. After wrapping up victory over <strong>Kent</strong> at Riverside on Friday morning, to usurp Nottinghamshire at the top of the First Division, they avoided a points deduction later the same day when a pitch panel opted not to penalise them for a sub-standard pitch.</p> <p>Yesterday proved to be pretty handy too - even though they weren't playing - because rain all but wiped out the Championship programme, thereby leaving Durham's title rivals banging their fists in frustration.</p> <p>The only match in either division in which there was any play was at Taunton, where <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong> knew a victory over <strong>Somerset</strong> would be good enough to take them back to the top of the table.</p> <p>During the 9.1 overs that were possible before lunch, the visiting side, who required 212 to win, advanced their overnight score from 63 for three to 125 for four, with Andre Adams the man to fall. There was no more play before tea, though the match had not yet been abandoned at that stage. </p> <p>In the other First Division match, <strong>Sussex</strong>, who by no means have given up hope of retaining their title, were well placed to beat <strong>Lancashire</strong> at Old Trafford before the last day was washed out without a ball being bowled.</p> <p>It was not altogether surprising that a pitch panel - which Rob Key, the Kent captain, described as 'a bit of a Muppet Show' - was convened at Riverside, where Durham's game against Kent produced a total of 465 runs, an average of 116 per completed innings, for the loss of 40 wickets. So Geoff Cook, the Durham director of cricket, must have been a relieved man. </p> <p>'I suppose I was relieved, in as much as there was a pitch panel sitting and passing judgement,' he said. 'But we and the umpires were of one mind. Although there was some seam movement, it wasn't unplayable by any stretch of the imagination, despite the scores. As often happens, things like that are exacerbated by the atmospheric conditions. They were really good conditions to bowl in, although there was some indifferent batting too.' </p> <p>All in all, it has been another encouraging season for Durham, who finished as runners-up in the Championship last summer - their highest finish since becoming a first-class county in 1992 - as well as winning the Friends Provident Trophy and being promoted in the Pro40 League. However, Cook believes it is a little early to start talking about winning the title this time around. </p> <p>'There is a long way to go,' he added. 'As a team and as a club, we did pretty well last year, but it was important that we consolidated this summer. The first half of the season was reasonable, but, ultimately, disappointing because we were beaten semi-finalists in both the Friends Provident Trophy and the Twenty20 Cup.</p> <p>'It is all very close at the top of the Championship table and there are a few strong sides. The team that is lucky with injuries, international call-ups and, most importantly, the weather could be the ones to emerge as champions.' </p> <p>With the Test match against South Africa due to finish tomorrow, it is extremely unlikely Stephen Harmison will be selected for Durham's crucial four-day match against Nottinghamshire, which starts on Tuesday. But the rejuvenated pace bowler should be available for the rest of the county's Championship programme.</p> <p><strong>Worcestershire</strong>, who lead the Second Division, were denied the opportunity to claim a fourth successive win when rain washed out the final day of their match against <strong>Derbyshire</strong> at New Road. The leaders had to make do with 12 points after the abandonment at 1.20pm, but the maximum points haul for a draw keeps them ahead of <strong>Warwickshire</strong> and <strong>Northamptonshire</strong>, whose match at Edgbaston looks likely to end in stalemate today. The games between <strong>Glamorgan</strong> and <strong>Middlesex</strong> at Colwyn Bay and <strong>Gloucestershire</strong> and <strong>Leicestershire</strong> at Cheltenham were also abandoned as draws.</p>",

  "<p>Spain's incredible sporting summer took another surprising step when Samuel Sanchez added the Olympic road race gold medal to the country's trophy cabinet, already overflowing after Carlos Sastre's Tour de France victory, Alberto Contador's win in the Giro d'Italia, Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon and the European title for their football players.</p> <p>A solid rather than spectacular talent, Sanchez has played second fiddle to Alejandro Valverde in recent years, and the national champion was expected to be Spain's leader here. However, Valverde did not figure in the decisive attack on the final lap, and instead it was the 30-year-old from the Asturian town of Oviedo who crossed the finish line in the shadow of the Great Wall ahead of five men who came together only in the final metres.</p> <p>Sanchez had the pedigree of a man just waiting for a truly major win: seventh overall in this year's Tour de France, a raft of stage wins in the Vuelta a Espana, and a significant one-day victory in the Championship of Zurich in 2006. His impressive win cannot, however, overcome the suspicions that have surrounded Spanish cycling in recent years. Sanchez has not been linked to any scandals, but like the rest of his country's road race team he had been tested eight times since his arrival here, although the IOC president Jacques Rogge said last Thursday that there were no particular suspicions about the Spanish.</p> <p>The bulk of the race was merely a wearing down process, but a truly gripping final lap made up for the initial lack of fireworks. As the race climbed to the Badaling fortress for the final time, the Luxembourgeois Andy Schleck put in a searing, prolonged acceleration, and by the top the only men with him were Sanchez and the aging Italian one-day specialist Davide Rebellin.</p> <p>The trio looked to be clean away, but they were joined before the finish by Michael Rogers of Australia and the Russian Michael Kolobnev \u2013 who had initially formed part of the Shleck-led breakaway \u2013 and Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland, who put in a truly electrifying descent to sweep up Rogers and Kolobnev before dragging them up to the leading trio within the final kilometre. The world time-trial champion was unable to follow through in the finish sprint, but he will now be the clear favourite in his speciality on Wednesday.</p> <p>As road races go, this was visually sumptuous, beginning with the stately run through the capital, under the glaring portrait of Chairman Mao on the great mausoleum in the vast expanse of Tiananmen Square, past the Bird's Nest and the Water Cube and so eventually into the countryside, a reminder with its rural gardens of maize and runner-beans of the China that much of the Olympic family will never see during this Games.</p> <p>Soon the first foothills beckoned greenly through the morning mist, and finally came the great snaking mass of the Wall itself, clinging in unlikely style to one ridge, then the next. First came the brief pull up to the finish line, in a cleft in the hills, then a gateway through the wall that led to the long drag to the fortress, followed in turn by a swoop back down to the valley \u2013 including a lengthy tunnel - before the whole heartbreaking process began again. </p> <p>In the first significant move, initially at least, was one of the British quartet, the Manxman Jonny Bellis, bronze medallist in last year's Under-23 world title race and the youngest rider in the race. His presence in a group of 30 that escaped on the run-out from Beijing showed tactical nous, but he lacked the horsepower to hold on once the Tour de France winner Sastre began setting the pace up the hill to Badaling.</p> <p>He soon became the first of many to hit the wall at the Wall, and was followed by his team-mates Steve Cummings and Roger Hammond. Ben Swift lasted the longest of Britain's quartet, but not surprisingly for a 20-year-old the distance got to him and he faded in the final two laps before quitting. However, he had never raced over this distance before, and the experience will prove invaluable in London in four years' time.</p> <p>It was the Italians who did the initial work to bring the group of early escapees into the fold before the Spaniards took over, with first Sastre and then Contador keeping the pace high in the final laps. The two Tour winners wore themselves out well before the bell, but their efforts were rewarded by a canny final lap from Sanchez.</p>",
  "<p>I have just looked at the Olympics countdown clock on my computer and it is no longer counting the days. I've had the clock on my screen for the last 200 days and to see it so static and still is making me sweat. The last time I wrote, just before leaving the UK, was little over a week ago but it seems like an age. Since then we have travelled to China on business class (well somebody has to do it!) and begun the process of acclimatisation and tapering.</p> <p>Upon arriving in China we were warmly greeted by friendly faces and humid weather. The Chinese are amazing, they will do anything for us and are willing to help in any way possible. It's been great so far. We've even had evening drinks with the British ambassador - although when I say drinks I mean apple juice and plenty of water - and we're ready for our first race tomorrow.</p> <p>The British rowers are not staying in the Olympic village for the first week of competition. Our well-organised management staff have got us accommodation next to the Shunyi rowing course, which will be a significant competitive edge. But we have visited the Olympic village, which was something else. There is more security than Fort Knox but once you are inside it is phenomenal.</p> <p>To be honest I didn't know what to expect, but the Chinese have really spared no expense. There are games rooms, TV rooms, gyms, swimming pools and so much more. But what I really want to talk about is the food hall. Wow. It sits 6,000 and has so much food there that not even our heavyweight men could polish it all up. With food choices from Asian to Mediterranean I didn't know where to start, so I had a bit of everything. Stuff being a lightweight for an hour!</p> <p>The Shunyi rowing course is very much like Dorney only a little bigger, and training on the course has been going well. But after being out here for a week now we are itching to get racing: we have done all that we can in our crew to put ourselves in the best possible condition - now it's up to us to perform.</p> <p>Our draw came out on Thursday and we are going up against some tough opposition but who said it would be a walkover? All of our races from the heat to the final will be gut-busters. To be honest the mood in the four is sometimes tense but that works for us, it means we know that something big is coming up and feeling nerves is a good sign. All the years of training will come into play in the next week or so. We want to make the most of it and I'm sure we will. We are ready to race.</p> <p><em>Richard will be writing for guardian.co.uk throughout the Beijing Olympics</em></p>"
