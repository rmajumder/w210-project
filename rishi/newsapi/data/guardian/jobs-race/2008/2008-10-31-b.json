  "<p>Rahm Emanuel, a Democratic congressman from Illinois, has emerged as a possible candidate for the key job of White House chief of staff if <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> wins the US presidency.</p> <p>Unnamed Democrats have told the Associated Press that Obama's campaign has approached Emanuel about taking on the role. Tom Daschle, the highly respected former Senate Democratic leader, has also been connected with the position.</p> <p>Emanuel worked in Bill Clinton's White House and is now a member of the House Democratic leadership. </p> <p>Obama, who holds a comfortable lead in the polls, played down talk of potential top-level appointments to deflect accusations that he was overconfident. Asked about the reports on Emanuel, Obama said last night: \"I'm trying to win an election\u2026 Plouffe is my chief of staff.\" </p> <p>David Plouffe heads Obama's election campaign.</p> <p>Bill Burton, a spokesman for Obama, said: \"There's no news because there's no job to offer ... We're focused on one thing and that's the election, not anonymous DC parlour games.\"</p> <p>Obama and his Republican rival, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>, have authorised aides in recent weeks to begin work on planning their transition to power.</p> <p>Emanuel is an old friend of Obama's campaign strategist David Axelrod and worked on Clinton's 1992 campaign before joining the White House staff.</p> <p>He has the loyalty of many Democratic congressmen, whom he recruited, and was an effective fundraiser during the 2006 congressional elections when the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.</p> <p>But Obama may want Emanuel to stay where he is; as a high-ranking member of the House he could help Obama push through his legislative agenda.</p> <p>Obama continues to maintain his lead over McCain in the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/latestpolls/index.html\">polls</a>. A Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll released today showed the Democratic candidate holding on to a seven-point lead as the race enters its final four days.</p> <p>Obama leads McCain by 50% to 43% among likely voters in the three-day national tracking poll, virtually unchanged from Thursday. The telephone poll has a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points. </p> <p>Obama has led McCain in every national opinion poll for weeks and McCain trails in many of the key battleground states including Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania.</p> <p>\"If you are John McCain, you want to see something start changing in this race, and right now it is not,\" said the pollster John Zogby.</p>",
  "<p>Weird tidings from downtown Manhattan as \u2013 on the cusp of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselections2008\">America's election</a> of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> and all that it signifies \u2013 the refined world of indie film culture gets snarled up over the issue of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/race\">race</a>. The problem has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126479/ballast\">Ballast</a>, first-time director <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZBuxyMLi7k\">Lance Hammer</a>'s sombre portrait of a troubled black family in the Mississippi Delta, freshly screened at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/londonfilmfestival\">London film festival</a> and <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&amp;jump=review&amp;id=2471&amp;reviewid=VE1117935837\">a critical hit</a> during its recent theatrical release in the States. Except not everyone has proved so favourably disposed to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film\">film</a> exalted by the New York Times as \"startlingly pitch-perfect.\"</p> <p>As noted by <a href=\"http://blog.spout.com/2008/10/24/ballast-backlash-defense/\">Steven Boone at Spout Blog</a>, peevishness nipped at the movie from the outset \u2013 but the <a href=\"http://www.nypress.com/21/40/film/armond4.cfm\">sternest slapdown has come from the occasionally brilliant contrarian critic Armond White</a>, who saw in his New York Press review of Hammer's account of everyday African-American struggle only \"ludicrous black phantoms.\" And not any old ludicrous phantoms \u2013 but ones created to distract the eye from the \"white middle-class fantasies at the film's core.\"</p> <p>This is a heavy-duty charge, the implications of which deserve to have the bones picked out of them. For packed into White's critical grenade are a wad of misdirections and awkward truths. On one level, the inferred notion that a black American family suffering desperate economic and emotional hardship is somehow a cliche overplayed by white liberals seems a deeply strange point. On another, it's hard to take issue with the claim that most black audiences are unlikely to ever take the slightest notice of Hammer's debut feature; just as the salt-of-the-earth visions of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/kenloach\">Ken Loach</a> have succeeded in rousing generations of well-fed north London cinephiles, it's hard to see Ballast ever intruding into the kinds of lives it actually depicts.</p> <p>Yet the blunt truth is that, however garlanded the movie, the commercial audience for almost all arthouse cinema is so under-sized as to leave it all but meaningless. Once you buy into the idea that the indie film unwatched by the kinds of people it portrays is pointless you could invalidate pretty much the entire form at a stroke. That said, for the record, White's implication that non-mainstream cinema is a white pastime feels like a mighty big reach; certainly one the black film-heads I know and work with would be greatly taken aback by. </p> <p>More troubling is the accusation that Ballast takes a pre-fab aesthetic (the obvious touchstone being the sad-eyed neo-realism of the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-secret-of-the-dardenne-brothers-palme-dor-success-470135.html\">Dardenne brothers</a>) and applies it to a cast of black characters whose presence often seems slightly irrelevant \u2013 their cultural identity secondary to Hammer's grand design. And yet it's that very quality (or flaw) that saves the day. Watching the frequently beautiful Ballast, it never seems intended as a comment on black life; rural poor life, perhaps; at its best, simply life. But still White ends up characterising the movie as simply one in which \"African-American life [is] controlled by white liberal condescension.\"</p> <p>And in that cudgel blow of a conclusion, I worry his argument loses its spiky nuances and risks looking like a simple attack on the film-maker who ventures outside their own racial experience when they step behind the camera. It's an impression not helped by the description of Ballast as a mere \"calling card,\" with all the scathing connotations of Hammer using his impoverished black characters as so many stepping stones before strutting off to work with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/bradpitt\">Brad Pitt</a>. As low-blows go, it's an invidious one, for what is the first-time director who makes a film about any racial (or sexual or political or generational) world outside their own meant to do afterwards \u2013 commit to making nothing but more of the same, or risk being judged a self-interested user? </p> <p>And the no-win nature of that equation (from which the only escape would be not risking entrapment in the first place) does the same degree of disservice to <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=EleJQLSJPk0\">David Gordon Green</a> (the white director of 2000's superb <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/85010/george.washington\">George Washington</a>, with its young and non-professional black cast) as it does <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/audio/2008/oct/16/podcasting\">Steve McQueen</a>, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/124579/hunger\">Hunger</a> must surely be the year's most extraordinary film despite not being made by a white Irishman. And what about Franco Rosso, Spike Lee, Amma Assante and every other film-maker who ever made an indelible movie about characters of races other than their own? Me, I'm enough of a middle-class white liberal to feel quietly aggrieved at at least two of those adjective, but I can't help feeling that while black directors and black stories are still often marginalised and compartmentalised, Ballast shouldn't be made to carry the can for problems that plague a whole culture \u2013 and that sometimes, cinema should just be allowed to be cinema.</p>",
  "<p>The latest tally of US newspaper endorsements in the presidential race shows <strong>Barack Obama</strong> way out in the lead. The Democratic contender leads by 234 to 105 over Republican <strong>John McCain</strong>, a better than 2-1 margin. In circulation terms, Obama is even further ahead. Papers backing him have sales of more than 21m compared to 7m for McCain. It's all very different from four years ago when <strong>John Kerry</strong> barely edged <strong>George Bush</strong> in endorsements.
