  "<p>A 16-year-old Middle Eastern language school student has died after being beaten up in what police believe was a racially motivated attack.</p> <p>Mohammed al-Majed, who was from the Gulf state of Qatar, died in hospital on Sunday night from severe head injuries two days after he and his friends were set upon outside a kebab shop in Hastings, East Sussex. Police are treating his death as murder.</p> <p>Majed, described by friends as \"like a brother to everyone\", had spent five weeks in Hastings studying English at the EF International Language School. He had been due to return home next week.</p> <p>He and his friends were set upon as they left a social club for foreign students shortly before midnight on Friday. They were beaten, kicked and pelted with glass bottles by a group of youths, who stamped repeatedly on Majed's head before leaving him for dead. </p> <p>Majed's room-mate, Majd Al Ghannamah, 19, who suffered a black eye, said the assailants chanted racist abuse during the attack. \"They called me Saddam Hussain and Osama Bin Laden. We just wanted to get away, get home, but they attacked and we couldn't get away,\" he said.</p> <p>Another student suffered a head injury needing six stitches. \"I blame myself for not saving Mohammed, but where I come from, we are not used to this kind of thing happening. At home, we never need to defend ourselves like that,\" said the boy, who did not want to be named.</p> <p>A witness said the police had been warned earlier that evening about trouble brewing between locals and the foreigners. But they went away, and Majed was attacked an hour later. Sussex police said yesterday they had no record of the warning, but admitted officers may well have been in the area before the attack.</p> <p>Majed had been socialising at a club at the USA Fried Chicken and Kebab house, which has a large area with pool tables at the back used as a hangout by students who come to study English each summer.</p> <p>The owner, Remzi Tanriverdi, 43, said trouble started after some local youths started drinking alcohol outside the shop. Tanriverdi, a Kurd who moved to Hastings five years ago, asked them to leave, but they refused and verbally abused him. </p> <p>He said: \"After I asked them to leave, I noticed a police car pull up outside. I asked them to keep an eye on the boys, and they said they would - then left. Less than an hour later, Mohammed - who was like a brother to everyone here - had been beaten. The attack was completely unprovoked and without reason.\"</p> <p>Tanriverdi said he had complained to the police \"more than 20 times\" about problems with local youths since he bought the kebab shop in 2005.</p> <p>He added: \"What parent will want to send their children here when they know things like this are happening?\"</p> <p>Yesterday another of Majed's room-mates, 17-year-old Abdul Aziz, said: \"We are all deeply shocked at what's happened. Mohammed was everyone's friend. We cannot believe something like this could happen. We will never come back here.\"</p> <p>Three males, aged 17, 18 and 20, have been arrested and released on police bail pending further inquiries.</p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Graham Pratt, who is leading the investigation, appealed for witnesses. \"The young man was a visitor to Hastings and his death is tragic. Our thoughts are with his family.\"</p> <p>Sussex police said it had increased patrols in the area to reassure people and would continue to work with language schools to address any issues.</p> <p>It is estimated that about 30,000 to 50,000 foreign students come to Hastings and nearby Rother each summer.</p>",
  "<p>Crucial government funding cuts are \"leaving black youths to die\", an independent advisor to the Home Office warned today.</p> <p>Dr Derrick Campbell said financial support earmarked for community cohesion was not going to the right organisations. </p> <p>His controversial comments came as police appealed for calm in Birmingham after gang violence caused two deaths in the West Midlands in just 24 hours. </p> <p>All three incidents involved black youths and included the shooting dead of Dimitri Foskin, 24, in the Newtown area of Birmingham on Saturday night. </p> <p>Campbell, who is chairman of the National Independent Advisory Group on Criminal Use of Firearms, told the BBC: \"We have clear evidence of organisations which used to be funded and have delivered on outcomes but have suddenly not been supported. </p> <p>\"We have to ask the question whether there seems to be an acceptance that if another black youth is killed they are just another one that we don't have to worry about. </p> <p>\"Black youths within this country have been left to die. And that's a very strong statement but it's a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed.\"</p> <p>Campbell said there was hard evidence from community groups in the Birmingham area that their level of funding was being cut - a situation that he claimed was reflected nationally. </p> <p>He added: \"Now we're asking very serious questions of national government and local government as to why it seems that resources that have been allocated for community cohesion and other activities have not been going to those organisations.\" </p> <p>A Home Office spokesman told the BBC: \"The government is committed to tackling gun, gang and knife crime and getting weapons off our streets. </p> <p>\"In July we launched the \u00a3100m youth crime action plan which sets out a comprehensive package of tough enforcement and intensive prevention measures as well as more support for parents to tackle offending and reduce reoffending.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was business as usual for Audi at Mosport as Lucas Luhr and Marco Werner claimed their third consecutive victory in the American Le Mans Series.</p> <p>Luhr was forced to work hard for the win, however, as he pitted with 45 minutes to go and rejoined in eighth place. The German fought his way back through the field eventually finishing 20 seconds ahead of team-mates Emanuele Pirro and Dindo Capello. It was the third consecutive one-two finish for the marque and gave Audi its ninth straight P1 championship.</p> <p>\"We made up about 30 seconds in the last part of the race,\" said Luhr. \"If that's what it takes to win, then we do it. It's always really tough [with traffic]. They are racing and we are racing. I saw two or three GT cars racing while I was trying to catch the leader. I can't waste time or tires and it's not easy to find the right way. We didn't touch anyone today so we did OK.\"</p> <p>Scott Sharp and David Brabham finished third in their Acura after the similar car of Simon Pagenaud and Gil de Ferran ran out of fuel on the last lap. \"It was fantastic racing,\" said Brabham. \"We were passing backward and forward. It was a joy to be a part of it.\"</p>",
  "<p>At the Olympics in Beijing, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26136779/\">swimmer Cullen Jones took home yet another gold medal</a> for Team USA. It's no surprise that a swimming gold was won by an American \u2013 Michael Phelps has collected quite a few on his country's behalf this year. What was particularly interesting about Jones's participation as part of the 4x100m freestyle relay team is that he is African-American \u2013 only the <a href=\"http://www.tommcmahon.net/2008/08/the-complete-li.html\">second black American swimmer</a> to have ever won an Olympic gold medal.</p> <p>Swimming is not a sport in which you tend to see black faces, and in the rare instances in which you do see them, they are some of the slower competitors. I'm sure we all fondly remember African swimmer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Moussambani\">Eric the Eel</a> who took nearly two minutes (the record, set this year, is 47.05 seconds) to complete the 100m freestyle in the 2000 Olympics. </p> <p>Contrast this with sprinting and basketball, which are dominated by black athletes from all over the world. The 10 fastest 100m male sprinters in the world are all black, as are eight of the world's 10 fastest women. </p> <p>This difference has yet again raised the highly controversial issue of the influence of race in sports. Is there some kind of biological, racially orientated basis for why some groups of people do better in some sports than others?</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago I sat down to dinner with some (white) friends who gave me their take on this. One explained that black people have denser bones which, apparently, make it harder for us to float in water. The other one, who works in the sports industry, said that black people have fast twitch fibres in their thighs which enable us to run faster over shorter distances. </p> <p>Such stereotypes are not uncommon. A recent study indicates that <a href=\"http://intl-jbs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/38/2/155\">even among sports coaches</a> \"some stereotype replication and susceptibility to natural ability stereotypes due to an overemphasis on biological determinism, and modest recognition of less immediately apparent developmental factors exists.\"</p> <p>I believe that such racially orientated theories must be treated with caution. In his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/158648026X/ref=sib_dp_pt#reader-link\">Taboo: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and Why We're Afraid to Talk About It</a> American journalist Jon Etine dismisses my perspective as \"political correctness\". However, if it's OK to equate black dominance in sprinting to biological factors based on race, it also then paves the way for equating black underachievement in education, for example, to inherent racially orientated biological differences, such as smaller brains. The science behind such theories is highly questionable and, for the most part, unsubstantiated.</p> <p>There is undoubtedly a wide gap between black and white participation in certain sports. According to a <a href=\"https://swimfoundation.org/NETCOMMUNITY/SSLPage.aspx?pid=281&amp;srcid=231\">recent study by USA Swimming</a>, nearly 60% of African-American children between the ages of six and 16 are unable to swim, in comparison to 31% of white children. It seems to me that the reason for why people do better in any kind of sport is primarily cultural as opposed to racial. Biology alone cannot account for success, or lack thereof. If it could, I too would be an Olympic gold medallist. As it is, I can just about run around my local track a few times before running out of steam.</p> <p>The sports toward which black people are generally guided, or gravitate \u2013 such as football and basketball \u2013 are those that are seen as having the most opportunities for us to excel in. A <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1999-15054-009\">1999 study by the University of Arizona</a> actually shows that so ingrained are the stereotypes about racial superiority and inferiority in certain sports that they affect not only which sports both black and white people gravitate toward but also their performance in those sports.</p> <p>The environment in which you live and are educated also plays a role. For example, how many Olympic-size swimming pools are there in sub-Saharan Africa? Although Eric the Eel was mocked for his slowness, the reality is that in his hometown in Equatorial Guinea, he only had access to a 20m pool. </p> <p>In the west, where the vast majority of black people live in the inner cities, the types of sports they engage in are the ones most suited to an inner-city environment, not only in terms of access but also cost. This may explain why basketball courts are found on most inner-city blocks in African-American neighbourhoods: they are cheap to build, require little maintenance and participation is affordable. </p> <p>There are very few swimming pools, tennis courts and golf courses built in black communities, and they tend to require higher financial outlay. Golf and tennis are usually the domain of private membership clubs, and \u2013 even with the stunning successes of Tiger Woods and the Williams sisters \u2013 are still considered white, upper middle-class sports. The USA Swimming study found that swimming ability, regardless of race, actually increases in relation to parents' income and education.</p> <p>Sports remains one area in which it still considered somewhat acceptable to make racial generalisations, and in which inaccurate stereotypes still abound. Of course, I understand the interest in why certain groups dominate certain sports. The same questions could be asked of the Chinese with gymnastics. However, as <a href=\"http://media.www.thehilltoponline.com/media/storage/paper590/news/2007/02/15/Sports/Athletes.Deal.With.Racial.Stereotypes.In.Sports-2722593.shtml\">Doris Corbett</a>, a professor and sports sociologist at Howard University's department of health, human performance and leisure studies said last year: \"A complete explanation would include sociological factors, such as geography, access to individual coaching, the costs associated with participation, socialisation opportunities, the availability of role models and the potential financial rewards in specific sports.\" I have to say, I agree with her.</p>"
