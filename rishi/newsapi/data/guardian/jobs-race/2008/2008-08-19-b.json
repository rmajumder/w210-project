  "<p>Christine Ohuruogu, who last night won Britain's first Olympic 400m gold medal since Eric Liddell in 1924, admitted that she had run the race blind. \"I had a race plan but as usual it went out the window,\" she said \"I was in my own world. People said 'Did you know Sanya [Richards] had gone off very hard?' but she was in lane seven and I couldn't see her. </p> <p>\"All I had to work off was the Russian girl outside me who I knew would go off very hard, and at 200 metres I was annoyed with myself that I had left myself too much work.\" </p> <p>In fact the 24-year-old Londoner timed her performance to perfection, charging through in the final 30m to beat the American superstar Sanya Richards and add the Olympics to her world and Commonwealth crowns. But Ohuruogu, who was in Beijing after winning her appeal against the British Olympic Association's lifetime ban after three missed drug tests, is unsure if she will run at the London 2012 Games which take place a couple of miles from her family home.</p> <p>\"It's something I have given thought to but it's a long way away,\" she said. \"The Olympics will be 15 minutes from where my parents live, that is where I was brought up, where I have lived all my life. It would be great if I could say I will be there, but you have take each year as it comes.\"</p> <p>Ohuruogu had been tipped to become the face of 2012 after she won the Commonwealth Games title in Melbourne two years ago. But her life was turned upside down when she was suspended, for 12 months, for missing the tests. She returned last year summer in spectacular fashion to win the world title in Osaka and has now joined Britain's greatest female athletes with this magnificent run. </p> <p>She becomes only the fourth British woman to win an Olympic track gold medal alongside Ann Packer, who won the 800m in 1964, Sally Gunnell, who won the 400m hurdles in 1992, and Dame Kelly Holmes, who triumphed in the 800m and 1500m in Athens four years ago. </p> <p>After Ohuruogu won in Osaka, Sebastian Coe, the chairman of London 2012, said: \"She could be one of our ambassadors but we have never discussed anyone being the face of 2012.\" Coe was part of the presentation party here, handing Ohuruogu her flowers on the podium. \"He [Seb] was really happy,\" she said. \"It's been a great British Olympics. I did not have nightmares that I would never be here.\" </p> <p>Her coach, Lloyd Cowan, was in no doubt that she should be used for 2012. \"If you can't sell that then what is the London Games about?\" Cowan said after watching his charge storm to victory in the Bird's Nest Stadium. \"Maybe the face is not the one you want to see, but if you can't sell the Olympic, world and Commonwealth champion, then what does that say about London and what we are doing?\" </p> <p>Cowan attributed her victory to strength of body and mind. \"What she does is not easy. But she has huge mental strength when it counts. People say bad things about you because they want to bring you down, and she has had to go through that for a whole year,\" he said. \"How would you feel if you ended up in prison, you have been released and you are trying to do your honest day's work and people keep bringing up the past? </p> <p>\"But we cannot control what people think. We do our job and people judge us on that job. We invest in all sorts of athletes but she delivers. The bottom line is that we get there and we perform.\" </p> <p>As a double winner of the Golden League and having beaten Ohuruogu three times last year, Richards was the favourite . She led from the start last night, but ran out of steam as Ohuruogu was reaching full power. The Briton won in 49.62sec - 0.01sec outside the personal-best time she ran in the final in Osaka. Proof, if more were needed, of her ability to save her best for when it matters.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's biggest police force will this week be plunged into crisis after one of its own leaders sues, alleging he was the victim of racial discrimination. Assistant commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, third most senior officer at Scotland Yard, is expected to issue employment tribunal proceedings that heap fresh pressure on Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan police commissioner.</p> <p>Senior sources close to both men have told the Guardian that the feud between the two leaders of British policing has been fermenting for years and has been barely concealed.</p> <p>Late in 2004, after it was announced that Blair would become the commissioner of the Met, colleagues dropped in to his Scotland Yard office to congratulate him. One of those well-wishers was Brian Paddick, then a senior Met officer. Paddick said Blair, then the deputy commissioner, commented: \"Brian, I don't know what I'll do if Tarique becomes my deputy.\"</p> <p>Ghaffur applied for the deputy job, but did not get it. For four years the enmity between Blair and Ghaffur has grown. </p> <p>Never before has so senior an officer been in such open rebellion against his force, and Ghaffur is now threatening to reveal embarrassing secrets about the Met.</p> <p>His employment tribunal claim will allege the commissioner was involved in Scotland Yard's investigation into whether the Labour government traded peerages for cash. The Met's commissioner has claimed to have had no involvement.</p> <p>Already sources close to the commissioner say they believe Ghaffur's allies are behind corruption allegations that have left Blair facing a formal inquiry over the awarding of \u00a33m worth of contracts to a friend. Ghaffur has collected hundreds of documents which, his allies say, will support his various claims.</p> <p>Allegations have also been made against Ghaffur. Since he let it be known in June that he was consulting lawyers, his private life has been trashed by two newspapers. His allies suspected the Met was involved.</p> <p>Sources on each side agree over Ghaffur's career prospects in the Met after 33 years as an officer. \"He's finished,\" two senior sources told the Guardian.</p> <p>A question many in government and the Met ask is how the commissioner, who took office promising to be a champion of diversity, ended up being accused of leading a racist force by the country's most senior Asian officer and one of the high-profile Muslims in British public life.</p> <p>Ghaffur joined the Met in 1999, after rising to become deputy chief constable in Lancashire. After two years Ghaffur angered senior white colleagues, including Blair, over the case of Ali Dizaei who was a rising star in the Met and fierce critic of the police over race.</p> <p>Both sides privately agree the direct feud between Ghaffur and Blair goes back to the case of Dizaei.</p> <p>Dizaei, then a superintendent, was subjected to a huge \u00a34m covert investigation which ended with his standing trial in 2003 on corruption charges. He was acquitted. Blair, who at the time was deputy commissioner, was in charge of the anti-corruption unit that pursued Dizaei. </p> <p>As early as 2001 it was privately known that Blair would land the job of Met commissioner, barring any mishap. The Dizaei case almost derailed his plans.</p> <p>Ghaffur, by then an assistant commissioner, gave evidence that many in the Met blamed for collapsing their case and helping Dizaei towards acquittal. Ghaffur told the jury Dizaei had been the victim of a witch-hunt. Dizaei was acquitted because the investigation into him spiralled out of control and produced no evidence of wrongdoing a jury would believe.</p> <p>Paddick said Ghaffur's testifying for Dizaei would have angered Blair: \"I don't think it is something Ian Blair has ever forgotten.\"</p> <p>Senior colleagues were enraged by his actions. A senior Met source said: \"It was a devastating blow to the case. Ian Blair was utterly furious with Tarique; he had no notice Tarique would do that and it was clearly damaging. It was at a critical time when Blair was launching his bid for commissioner.\"</p> <p>But as the dust cleared it emerged the Met had \"spied\" on Ghaffur. As undercover officers tailed Dizaei, recording his every move, they also taped his meetings with Ghaffur, his mentor. The Met claimed the spying on one of its most senior officers was accidental. </p> <p>Ghaffur, who was given the codename \"Vivaldi\" by the undercover team, believes his own force deliberately spied on him in an attempt to dig up dirt. He will claim he was also excluded from meetings about the Dizaei case while more junior officers were allowed to attend. </p> <p>Ghaffur moved on and set up a new unit tackling the most difficult crimes, the serious crime directorate. The unit would demonstrate his policing abilities and also be the issue on which he clashed again publicly with Blair and over which he very nearly got the sack.</p> <p>SCD tackled homicides and the upper end of crime. Ghaffur pioneered ways of working with communities and developed and led a unit that even his critics conceded was groundbreaking. Paddick said: \"He delivered excellent results. He did in the end win people round.\"</p> <p>But in 2006 the Met, now led by Blair, wanted to cut SCD's budget to spend on other areas of policing. Ghaffur, who was part of the Met's inner cabinet known as the management board, took a step unheard of in modern policing; he publicly threatened his own employer with legal action to try to stop the budget cuts.</p> <p>A senior Met source said: \"It would be seen as directly attacking the authority of the commissioner and cabinet [collective] responsibility.\"</p> <p>A senior source said: \"He came very close to not having his contract renewed ... he was saved by the commissioner and MPA losing their bottle. \"</p> <p>The public defiance led to Ghaffur being stripped of leading SCD and sent off to head the central operations unit, dealing with firearms and traffic. It was a redeployment meant to signal clearly to him that he was on the way out. A senior source said: \"By the time he [arrived at the unit] he was already in the last-chance saloon.\"</p> <p>Latterly Ghaffur has tried to become a chief constable of either the West Midlands, West Yorkshire or Greater Manchester force. He was unhappy at being moved to central operations, but when London was chosen to host the 2012 Olympics he was put in charge of the games' security. However, eventually the government decided the Met should not be running security, and put a Home Office official in charge.</p> <p>Ghaffur feels this was further evidence of his being undermined, and he will also claim to have been excluded from meetings about the Olympics.</p> <p>But was it racism or just the political nature of the top of British policing that saw Ghaffur's ambitions thwarted?</p> <p>One senior source with close knowledge of the Met said: \"Tarique has added value to the force, but he's reached his limit and does not realise that. I realise that I've reached my limit. He's brilliant at some things, but just doesn't realise his weaknesses.\"</p> <p>Ghaffur's issuing of formal legal proceedings will mean that the top six ethnic minority officers in the Met have all sued or are suing the force for racial discrimination. </p> <p>In 1999 the Met was found to be institutionally racist by a public inquiry and it has been trying ever since to prove otherwise. Ethnic minority officers, headed by Ghaffur, believe the force is still prejudiced.</p> <p>Lee Jasper, a former adviser on race and police to the former mayor of London Ken Livingstone, knows Blair and Ghaffur well and is a fan of both. He says that the impact of Ghaffur suing could be serious: \"The effect will be disastrous. It represents a real setback for their race equality efforts internally.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Birmingham Post is switching from broadsheet to a tabloid format as part of sweeping changes to Trinity Mirror's Midlands publishing operation, which will also see 65 editorial posts axed.</p> <p>In a radical overhaul of its Midlands operation, Trinity Mirror is creating two large new integrated multimedia newsrooms in Birmingham and Coventry providing editorial for five titles, including the Birmingham Post and the Coventry Telegraph.</p> <p>Trinity Mirror is also looking to sell two paid-for weeklies and five free titles as part of the overhaul of its Midlands business.

The Birmingham facility in Trinity's new regional HQ at Fort Dunlop is due to be fully operational by November, with the new Coventry newsroom up and running by the end of the year.</p> <p>As part of the reorganisation in Birmingham, Trinity Mirror's morning paper, the Birmingham Post, will relaunch in the autumn as a business-focused tabloid and drop its Saturday edition to become a five-day title as it integrates operations with evening title the Birmingham Mail and the Sunday Mercury newspaper.</p> <h2>Multimedia desk</h2> <p>A single multimedia desk in Birmingham will replace the existing title-specific news desks, overseeing the creation of editorial content for all three papers and their online platforms through the adoption of the ContentWatch system.</p> <p>Trinity Mirror's three Birmingham titles will be served by a single sports desk at the new multimedia facility.</p> <p>A similar integrated desk will be introduced to serve Trinity's Coventry Telegraph and Coventry Times newspapers by the end of the year.</p> <p>The new multimedia desks in Birmingham and Coventry will be supported by a single regional production unit, based at Trinity's new Birmingham headquarters at Fort Dunlop in the north of the city, where pages will be finished and quality-checked.</p> <p>It is understood that page production for Trinity Mirror's 30 weekly titles in the Midlands region will also be centralised in this way at the Fort Dunlop site, after Trinity's Birmingham-based publications complete their move into the building later in the year.</p> <p>However, the move comes at a cost. Trinity Mirror said that the new editorial structure, which includes a \u00a37.5m investment in technology, will require substantially fewer journalists.</p> <p>Although some staff training is expected, Trinity Mirror estimates that 65 editorial positions will go as a result of the integration. </p> <p>It is not known from which departments these job losses will come, although the adoption of the new editorial system suggests that there may be losses in production.</p> <p>A Trinity Mirror spokesman said the company has entered a consultation with staff.</p> <h2>Job cuts</h2> <p>He added that the company hoped to meet the number of job cuts through voluntary means, although it could not rule out the need for compulsory redundancies.</p> <p>\"All publishers are trying to address the difficulties of trading at the moment, at the same time we're trying to build our multimedia future as well. In business terms we had to reduce staff numbers to build for the future,\" the Trinity Mirror Regionals editorial director, Neil Benson, said.</p> <p>\"Remaining staff will be trained better than at any time in the past. We have got to face economic realities but at the same time look at them in a bold and imaginative way.\"</p> <p>In addition to the radical overhaul of its Birmingham and Coventry publishing operations, Trinity Mirror is also looking to dispose of several weekly paid-for and free titles from its Midlands business.</p> <p>These include its four free weekly newspaper titles in Northampton: the Northampton Herald &amp; Post; Wellingborough, Rushden, Kettering and Corby Herald &amp; Post; Market Harborough Herald &amp; Post; and the Brackley &amp; Towcester Herald &amp; Post. The other titles affected are its two paid-for weeklies in Long Eaton - the Long Eaton Advertiser and Nu News - and its free title in that area, Long Eaton Trader.</p> <p>Trinity Mirror will look to sell the titles, although if a buyer cannot be found they will be closed, which could mean further job losses.</p> <h2>Advertising downturn</h2> <p>At the end of July, Trinity Mirror announced that its operating profits fell by \u00a315m to \u00a380m for the half year to June 29, down from \u00a395.6m in the same period a year ago.</p> <p>The Trinity Mirror chief executive, Sly Bailey, warned that the advertising downturn would continue for some considerable time yet and said plans for a further \u00a320m in cost cuts across the group were needed as a result.</p> <p>The development of an integrated approach in the Midlands follows the development of a similar integrated newsroom, introduced in April by Media Wales, in Cardiff.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediaguardian.co.uk\">editor@mediaguardian.co.uk</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>Unions and analysts believe <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marksspencer\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a> is preparing to cut jobs after it confirmed that it is planning to reduce the amount its employees would receive if they were made redundant.</p> <p>The high street retailer, which shocked the City in July by warning that sales and profits were tumbling, confirmed today that it wants to bring in the changes from next month. They could mean long-serving staff would receive many thousands of pounds less if they were laid off.</p> <p>M&amp;S refused to comment on the concern that it could be planning a cull at a time when the slowing economy is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/14/unemploymentdata.economicgrowth\">pushing up unemployment</a>.</p> <p>\"This is about bringing us into line with what the market is doing,\" said an M&amp;S spokeswoman, adding that the company would still offer better terms than its rivals, and double the statutary minimum.</p> <p>But Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB, fears the proposed changes are the prelude to some significant layoffs.</p> <p>\"Companies don't cut redundancy payouts in advance unless they are planning some pretty swingeing cuts,\" warned Kenny.</p> <p>Kenny also accused M&amp;S of taking a \"cavalier\" attitude to its workforce in recent years, which he claimed was encouraging more staff to join unions such as the GMB.</p> <p>Currently, a worker aged more than 40 is entitled to 3.75 weeks pay for every year spent at M&amp;S, but the company is now proposing cutting this to 3 weeks. Younger employees would see their payout cut from 2.5 weeks to 2 weeks for every year's service. Under the proposals, the maximum payout would also be cut from 70 weeks to 52.</p> <p>M&amp;S insists that it is open to feedback from its employee representatives \u2013 the 3,500 staff who represent the 60,000-strong workforce in negotiations with management.</p> <p>But according to the Times, these representatives have already warned that the proposals have <a href=\"http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/retailing/article4561341.ece\">alarmed and upset the retailer's staff</a>.</p> <p>Nick Bubb, analyst at Pali International, believes that M&amp;S suffered poor sales in July and may be under pressure to cut costs.</p> <p>\"With sales falling and costs rising, M&amp;S have to do something to try to protect profits, so it would come as no surprise if more cutbacks are coming at HQ and if M&amp;S scale back store openings more aggressively,\" said Bubb in a research note today.</p> <p>Some staff are understood to be particularly unhappy that their redundancy terms are being cut just weeks after Steven Esom, M&amp;S's former head of food, walked away with \u00a3500,000 after being sacked after just one year at the company.</p> <p>\"Why do people at the bottom, who have no control how the business is run, get the sack on the cheap while the top bosses get large payouts no matter how badly they have screwed up?\" asked Kenny.</p> <p>Last month chief executive Stuart Rose defended the payout to Esom saying that it was important to honour contractual obligations. <br></p>"
