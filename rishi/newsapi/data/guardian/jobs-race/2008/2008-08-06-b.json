  "<p>The empty aisles at the Kensington store of Whole Foods, the US supermarket chain, provided evidence yesterday of how British shoppers have turned their backs on upmarket food. The timing of the retailer's move to Britain could not have been more unfortunate with the main outlet opening last June - two months before the credit crunch started to hit. </p> <p>The Kensington store was meant to be the start of a big UK expansion. The retailer, which specialises in organic produce, hoped to capitalise on a growing appetite for healthy food and win customers over to its extensive selection of gourmet items, eight types of camembert cheese and black bean chipotle bread.</p> <p>But things are not going to plan. Whole Foods said this week it lost $18.4m (\u00a39m) in a year and is reconsidering its approach to Britain.</p> <p>The retailer envisaged a store bursting full with hungry workers fighting over its posh sandwiches and salads at lunchtime but yesterday it was virtually empty.</p> <p>Just a few metres away on Kensington High Street, a Tesco store was packed with customers buying their lunchtime sandwiches. There were long queues at every checkout - a stark contrast to Whole Foods.</p> <p>Trevor Bendall, a visual merchandiser, said he used to buy his lunch from Whole Foods but due to the state of the economy he has started to buy his sandwiches from Tesco as it is \"much cheaper\".</p> <p>In Whole Foods, a 500g pack of sugar costs \u00a32.99, compared to 56p in Tesco. Six free range eggs are \u00a32.29 in Whole Foods and \u00a31.36 in Tesco; a large white loaf is \u00a31.34 more expensive.</p> <p>Ali Smith, a personal assistant, said: \"Whole Foods is very expensive, I don't shop there regularly. The ideas there are great, there's a wide variety so you're paying for the choice. I once went in to buy Tabasco and it was three times the price.\"</p> <p>In a further challenge to Whole Foods, Tesco announced yesterday that it had slashed prices on organic produce by an average of 15%.</p> <p>As consumers try to save money, at least one US chain is benefiting: McDonalds is creating 4,000 jobs to cope with an increasing appetite for fast food.</p>",
  "<p>Cilla Black to host new dating show, Nick Knowles to makeover people's back gardens - again - and Bradley Walsh and Alex James competing to become a conductor in a new BBC2 reality show. Is it just me, or did a miserable Wednesday just get more miserable?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/musictv/maestro/\">Maestro</a>, which begins next Tuesday, is the most appalling prospect of the three. This is the BBC2 show in which a bunch of celebrities try to outdo each other for the chance to conduct an orchestra at the BBC Proms in the Park.</p> <p>You can imagine the pitch. \"It's a bit like Channel 4's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operatunity\">Operatunity</a> but with an orchestra instead. And celebrities. What better way to get people to watch classical music than by having <a href=\"http://www.bradleywalsh.co.uk/\">Bradley Walsh</a> waving a baton around?\"</p> <p>It was presumably at this point that BBC2 controller Roly Keating punched the air, exclaiming: \"Walsh? You can get me Bradley Walsh?\" and ordered his PA to get the really big lattes in.</p> <p>The line-up in full: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/nov/19/popandrock.foodanddrink\">Alex James</a>, Bradley Walsh, Jane Asher, David Soul - my eyes are filling up as I write this - Peter Snow, Clive Anderson, Katie Derham, Sue Perkins - bloody Sue Perkins - and Goldie.</p> <p>\"The creators are hoping that Maestro will take viewers on an exciting and educational voyage into the realms of music making,\" reports today's Independent.</p> <p>Most viewers, however, will presumably be tuning in to see which of the wannabe stick wavers has a nervous breakdown first. Exciting? Educational? Give it a couple of weeks and I'll probably be glued to it.</p> <p>\"Rock 'n' roll is 50 years old now, and I wonder if it hasn't said everything it has got to say,\" <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/make-me-a-maestro-alex-james-goes-to-baton-camp-886011.html\">said James, talking about the new show</a>. BBC2 is 44 years old. Maybe it's said everything it has got to say as well.</p> <p>Sister channel, BBC1 is about to bring us a new show in which <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtSnL0TciPg\">Nick Knowles</a> - women find him attractive, my ex-girlfriend once told me - makes over people's gardens. A bit like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwsKoEORFls\">Ground Force</a>, then, and too many other daytime shows to mention.</p> <p>But Wild About Your Garden has a twist - the gardens are being made over to encourage wildlife. See? It's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/springwatch/\">Springwatch</a> meets Garden Invaders. What they really should have done is commission an entire series of this - Adam and Joe's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUYTcHEp7_M\">Room For Change</a>.</p> <p>Sky One, never afraid of looking backwards to go forwards, is also dusting off an age-old format, the dating show, fronted by an age-old - steady on, a little respect please - presenter, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0l3qO9Eh_k\">Cilla Black</a>.</p> <p>Like Wild About Your Garden, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/06/bskyb.television\">Black's new show Loveland</a> also has a mind-bending USP - the contestants will be presented by real time cartoons! Have they thought about doing the same thing with Knowles?</p>",
  "<p>Cilla Black is to front her first major series since quitting Blind Date five years ago with a dating show for revamped cable and satellite entertainment channel Sky1.</p> <p>Loveland, billed as a \"21st-century twist on the dating show\", will be one of the highlights of Sky1's autumn schedule, which will also see a refresh of the channel's on-screen look.</p> <p>The dating show, the first commission for former FremantleMedia North America chief executive Tom Gutteridge's new company Standing Stone Productions, will involve a contestant having to choose one of three people to go on a date with.</p> <p>However, instead of meeting them face to face, contestants will meet their \"avatar\" alter egos - real-time cartoons that represent the three potential dates.</p> <p>Only when the contestant has made their choice will their real date be revealed.</p> <p>In a further twist, the couple's actual date will also see them have to undertake a challenge.</p> <p>Sky1 is currently developing a pilot for a 10-part series, which is scheduled to air next year. </p> <p>Black, who famously quit ITV's Blind Date live on air in May 2003, said: \"Loveland captivated me with its modern-day twist on the dating format, bringing something fresh and exciting to the genre.\"</p> <p>The Sky1 controller, Richard Woolfe, added: \"Cilla is the undisputed queen of the dating show. There's been many pretenders to her throne, but she remains in a class of her own.\"</p> <p>Other new Sky1 shows for the autumn include factual entertainment special Guinness World Records Smashed!, presented by Fearne Cotton and Ben Shephard.</p> <p>The 60-minute show, made by Outline Productions, will see members of the public and celebrities attempt to topple some of the world's toughest records in front of a live studio audience. </p> <p>Cotton has also found success fronting the US version of the Guinness World Record shows on NBC.</p> <p>Sky1 has also acquired the exclusive UK rights to the two hour-long Battlestar Galactica prequel Caprica, which stars Pulp Fiction's Eric Stoltz, NYPD Blue's Esai Morales and Deadwood's Paula Malcolmson.</p> <p>Ross Kemp also returns for a fourth series of Ross Kemp on Gangs.</p> <p>Kemp will also appear on Sky1 this autumn in two specials - Ross Kemp: A Kenya Special, which will follow the former EastEnders actor as he investigates the Mungiki gang; and Glue Kids of Kenya, about mothers and children addicted to glue who live on a rubbish dump.</p> <p>Matt Groening's sci-fi animation Futurama returns for 16 new episodes after a five-year gap, following the success of a series of straight to DVD film releases.</p> <p>The Simpsons' 20th season on Sky1 will include its first post-watershed episode - Love Springfieldian Style - which will air after 9pm because of the \"adult nature of its content\".</p> <p>Other shows already announced include the eight-part Hairspray: The School Musical; the two-hour special featuring Noel Edmonds, Noel's HQ; and Coke Zero Presents Wayne Rooney's Street Striker.</p> <p>Sky1 has also bought the US version of Gladiators, while Jack Bauer will return after a two-year break with feature length real-time special 24: Exile, starring Robert Carlyle and Jon Voight and filmed on location in South Africa.</p> <p>Noel's Are You Smarter Than a 10 Year Old?, Prison Break, Cold Case and Bones will also return to the channel for new series.</p> <p>Sky1's onscreen revamp, which will see the current logo replaced with a new light blue look, will go live on August 31.</p> <p>Woolfe said: \"The vibrant, energetic look reflects our strengthening entertainment positioning and puts the standout content right at its heart.</p> <p>\"My job is to continue to innovate and keep Sky1 ahead of its rivals with must-see exclusive TV - be it groundbreaking documentaries or broad family entertainment, home-grown drama or the best of the US. This autumn undoubtedly delivers on this promise.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.
