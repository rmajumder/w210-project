  "<p>The BBC's director of sport, Roger Mosey, is to step down from his role in order to lead the corporation's preparations and operations for the London 2012 Olympic games.</p> <p>Mosey will take on the new job of BBC director of London 2012, described by one source as a \"mega-job\".</p> <p>He will oversee the corporation's sport and cultural plans for what will be the biggest event the UK has ever hosted - and the biggest ever BBC production.</p> <p>The BBC director general, Mark Thompson, said: \"London 2012 is one of the biggest events in the UK to be held in our lifetimes and requires all our focus and energy.</p> <p>\"Now is the right time to take this important step in the BBC's planning for this momentous year. </p> <p>\"I witnessed first hand in Beijing what is required to successfully deliver such a major broadcasting event, and we all saw the outstanding coverage by the BBC. </p> <p>\"I believe Roger Mosey is ideally placed to fulfill such a challenging and important new role.\"</p> <p>Mosey, who will step down as director of sport once a replacement has been appointed, oversaw the BBC's hugely successful coverage of the Beijing games last month.</p> <p>In his new role, as well as dealing with the BBC's own preparations for 2012, he will also lead the corporation's relationship with external bodies such as the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (Locog). </p> <p>Although the BBC is not the host broadcaster for the 2012 games - coverage is contracted out by an Olympic company to broadcasters from around the world - expectations will be high for what it can do.</p> <p>Mosey has previously said he believes the games - which will coincide with the switchover to digital TV - will be as pivotal for British TV as the Coronation was 50 years ago, with the BBC hoping to show every event live.</p> <p>\"We know the Olympics are big operations and are even bigger now with the scale of the media interest,\" one BBC source said.</p> <p>\"What will be different next time is they are in Britain and, while there isn't a host broadcaster, the BBC has got to be perfect. It has really got to do a job where everyone says 'thank God for the BBC' and we need a big figure to make this happen.\"</p> <p>Mosey, who has been director of sport since August 2005, has had a number of high-profile roles within the BBC - he has been editor of Radio 4's Today programme, controller of BBC Radio 5 Live and head of BBC television news. </p> <p>In his new role, he will report to the deputy director general, Mark Byford, who is chairman of the BBC-wide London 2012 steering group. </p> <p>Byford said: \"The scale of the planning involved for London 2012 means it's right we appoint a full-time coordinating director now and Roger will be a pivotal player in ensuring the BBC provides well-coordinated, outstanding and innovative content.\"</p> <p>Mosey added: \"I am delighted to be taking up this exciting new role and new challenge which will allow us to build on the success of Beijing and deliver something even bigger and better for London.<br> \"I believe there's a fantastic opportunity to bring the whole of the BBC together - globally, nationally and locally - to provide an unforgettable sporting and cultural experience for our audiences.\"</p> <p>The change of role will mean Mosey will not move with the rest of the sport department to its new home in Salford in 2011.</p> <p>A small team, thought to be around 20 to 30 people, will stay in the capital to oversee preparations.</p> <p>Meanwhile, BBC sport's head of events, Dave Gordon, who coordinated the Beijing coverage, has also been confirmed in the role for the London games.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>Valentino Rossi battled with local hero Nicky Hayden to claim victory in the first-ever MotoGP race at America's historic Indianapolis Motor Speedway, held in the shadow of Hurricane Ike.</p> <p>The race was cut short by eight laps due to high winds and a soaking track, with Rossi overcoming a late-race wobble to take the flag and claim his fourth consecutive victory, also setting a new record for the most number of wins in the premier class. The weather had played havoc over the weekend, with litter and artificial grass being blown across the track.</p> <p>Rossi had started from pole position, but dropped to fourth at the start while Hayden - who had missed the previous two races with a foot injury - powered into the lead on the second lap and attempted to pull away. Fiat rider Rossi passed him on lap 14, however, with Hayden finishing second ahead of Jorge Lorenzo. It was later announced that 2006 champion Hayden will move from Honda to Ducati next season.</p> <p>\"I think that those are the worst conditions in which I have raced in my career,\" said Rossi. \"Together with the new track and the new surface, there was also a lot of water and, at the end, the bigger problem of the wind. I was in front and all the bags and beer cans were getting thrown onto the track by the wind. It [the wind] wasn't consistent and was very strong, so you never knew what was going to happen in the straight. I was in front and didn't want to put my hand up, because I was leading the race, but I was looking for the red flag on every lap and when it came I think it was a good decision.\"</p> <p>Rossi's victory was the 69th top-flight win of his career, breaking Giacomo Agostini's 30-year-old record, and he now has a near unassailable championship lead of 87 points over closest rival and reigning champion Casey Stoner. With four races left to run, five-times MotoGP champion Rossi can secure the 2008 title at Motegi, Japan, in a fortnight's time.</p>",
  "<p>The Brian de Palma film of Oliver Stone's screenplay for Scarface (1983) is a landmark film of the 80s. Despite lacklustre reviews on opening, it became an enormous global hit and confirmed Al Pacino as a worldwide star.</p> <p>The poster image for the film, a simplified graphic presentation of Pacino's Tony Montana in black and white and toting a powerful handgun, perfectly expresses the simplified moral universe of the late 20th century American gangster film.</p> <p>We've <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/22/2\">already looked</a> at how Hollywood managed to re-invent itself, after the moribund decade of the 1960s, by connecting with the energy and themes of independent and new wave film making. A significant element in this process was the renewed engagement, by Hollywood, with the historical legacy of American cinema. Nowhere was this more successfully realised than in the re-interpretation of the American gangster genre.</p> <h2>American gangsters</h2> <p>The historical development of the gangster genre can be traced back to the films of James Cagney during the 30s, such as The Public Enemy (1931) and the original Scarface (1932) by Howard Hawks. In the 40s the genre was recast as film noir and reflected the hardboiled crime fiction of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler.</p> <p>For Hammett and Chandler the main protagonists were the private detectives Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe. These figures inflected their stories with a world-weary cynicism, derived from experience, about the motives and intentions of their clients and cases. These stories explore themes that trace the corrupting influence of money amongst people who are already, by most standards, wealthy.</p> <h2>Dirty cops and clean gumshoes</h2> <p>The role of the local police services, and of law-and-order in general, was increasingly called into question and shown to be a system of social control whose corrupted officers played to a gallery of media interests. The purpose of this system was implicitly understood to be as much about maintaining social and economic advantage as about anything else. The fierce independence of the private investigator helped provide him with an oblique and morally uncompromised perspective on events.</p> <p>In contrast, the main characters of the gangster genre were usually drawn from the violent underclass of migrant communities and expressed through first-person narratives of moral disintegration that combine personal wealth and moral ruin. The combination of violence and material wealth, implicit in the gangster's social trajectory, undermined the steady moral ethos of the American dream for ordinary hard working families.</p> <h2>Gangsters reborn</h2> <p>At the end of the 1960s, the gangster genre was re-discovered. The urban setting, car-chase and random violence of the genre made it appropriate for the post-industrial society being conceptualized at the time. These characteristics were re-packaged, with contemporary irony, through a series of Roger Corman films. The films introduced the varied talents of Jack Nicholson and Francis Ford Coppola, amongst other, to the feature film industry.</p> <p>The first mainstream example of the gangster revival was Bonnie and Clyde (1967) by Arthur Penn and featuring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway in the title roles. The success of the film encouraged others to follow. Jack Nicholson reappeared in Polanski's Chinatown (1974) with Faye Dunaway, and Coppola embarked on the epic Godfather series (1972 and onwards).</p> <p>Another personality who emerged from Roger Corman's indie scene was Martin Scorsese. Mean Streets (1973), Goodfellas (1990) and Casino (1995) all provide a continuous thread through Scorsese's career and position the director's work into the social circumstances of his upbringing.</p> <p>The evolution of the gangster is derived from the traditional American quarrel over territory and control. Protection, guns, liquor and gambling follow in historical progression. Finally, the cocaine boom of the 1970s draws Latin and Italian syndicates towards a final showdown. This provides the starting point for Brian de Palma's Scarface.</p> <h2>De Palma</h2> <p>Brian de Palma began film making during the 60s and was instrumental in the discovery of Robert De Niro. De Palma has consistently made films that draw attention to their status as films. The stories, effects and conceits deployed by De Palma accentuate, and draw attention to, the illusionistic effects of film in contrast to the verisimilitude of traditional mainstream film.</p> <p>This is a hangover of de Palma's beginnings as a film maker in the New York avant-garde. Indeed, during the 60s de Palma he declared his intention of becoming the American Jean-Luc Godard. In fact, the political film making pioneered by Godard in Europe never successfully crossed the Atlantic and turned out, in the end, to have been something of an impasse.</p> <p>De Palma subsequently turned his attention to a more fruitful process of deconstructing the conventions of Hollywood genre storytelling. His first success was the horror genre Carrie (1976). Scarface, a reworking of an earlier Hollywood masterpiece, cemented de Palma's place as a member of the new Hollywood generation of directors. De Palma returned to explore themes of violent gangsterism in The Untouchables (1987), which includes a visual reference to Potemkin's famous Odesssa steps sequence (link to previous article), and Carlitto's Way (1993).</p> <h2>Al Pacino</h2> <p>Pacino plays the lead in Scarface with an intensity bourne out of his method acting training at the Lee Strasberg studio. His earlier success, in the Godfather films, lends him an authority in the gangster role of Tony Montana that is terrifying.</p> <p>The combination of drugs, guns, power and money combine to create a moral universe of arbitrary violence and degradation. Pacino plays this decline perfectly with increasing paranoia directed at those closest to him. In the end, Montana retreats into the closed off spaces of his mind and office. The end, when it comes, is brutal and swift.</p> <p>The poster for the film provides a visual icon for this reductive maelstrom. The simplification of the image, to a contrast of black and white, is an economical graphic device derived form screen-printing. The reductive simplicity of the image makes it a perfect icon for a landmark film.</p>",
  "<p>If you were looking forward to hearing Jack White's new song, a duet with Alicia Keys that ended months of speculation about who would perform the new James Bond theme, well, Coca-Cola have gone and spoiled it.</p> <p>Rather than being held back for the new 007 film, Quantum of Solace, the instrumental music for White's Another Way to Die is already on the telly, soundtracking an advert for Coke Zero - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/11/advertising.thewhitestripes\">exclusively revealed by MediaGuardian.co.uk last week</a>.</p> <p>The White Stripe isn't happy about it. His management released an official statement, saying \"Jack White was commissioned by Sony Pictures to write a theme song for the James Bond film Quantum Of Solace, not for Coca-Cola.\"</p> <p>\"Any other use of the song is based on decisions made by others, not by Jack White.\"</p> <p>However, it's not the first time White has been linked with the soft drink giant. The frontman penned a song specifically for a Coca-Cola advert in 2006, saying at the time he was interested in writing music in a new way. </p> <p>\"I've been offered the opportunity to write a song in a way which interests me as a songwriter,\" he told NME at the time, in response to what some saw as White selling out. Somewhat prophetically, he added: \"I certainly wouldn't want a song that I'd already written to be used on a commercial. That seems strange.\"</p> <p>The statement relating to the Zero Zero 7 campaign further distanced the White Stripes man from the advert, saying: \"We are disappointed that you first heard the song in a co-promotion for Coke Zero, rather than in its entirety.\"</p>"
