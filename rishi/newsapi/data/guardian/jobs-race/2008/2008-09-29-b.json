  "<p>It's a big blow for England that Michael Vaughan doesn't feel in the right frame of mind to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/englandinindia200809\">tour India</a>. People will wonder what I mean when they look at the difficult season he's had but I believe they will be in for a nasty shock if they really think he'll be easy to replace out there. Successful batting in India requires skill, character and patience - the three qualities Vaughan demonstrated so superbly when he made a match-saving hundred on a turning pitch against Muttiah Muralitharan at his peak in Kandy a few years ago.</p> <p>Who else of the current side can play an innings like that in the heat and humidity they're likely to encounter in Ahmedabad and Mumbai? It's a bit of a worry. The two openers, Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook, have the mentality but are both susceptible to spin, and you have to allow Kevin Pietersen to play his natural game. I'm not sure Ian Bell has shown yet he can adopt the mindset necessary to see off Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh for a whole day on a turning track, and Paul Collingwood can struggle early on against spin, however mentally tough he is.</p> <p>It's up to Vaughan how long he decides to rest now. You don't really need more than a month to six weeks' break as long as you're training during that time. Maybe a couple of games elsewhere would help but you need to be fully prepared for them and that might mean him missing out on a proper break. I believe that if he's in line for a return for the West Indies tour in the spring, then he can use the warm-up games there to iron out a couple of technical flaws that I've touched on before - mainly the fact that he's been getting too square on. Any suggestion his eye has gone is rubbish.</p> <p>After Vaughan's omission, yesterday's squad announcement took on a predictable look, but for me there are two main areas of concern. Spin bowlers in India require more variation than they do in England because the ball turns more. </p> <p>That might sound like a bit of a contradiction and playing spin early on in India can be difficult. But on the slow, low wickets you get out there, masses of predictable turn allows good batsmen the time and the width they need to pick off the runs.</p> <p>Unless you can land six balls out of six on a 100-rupee note, you need to mix it up and think like a batsman. That's why I would have liked to have seen Samit Patel given a chance: from what I saw of him in the one-day internationals against South Africa, he seems to have enough variation to keep the batsmen on their toes.</p> <p>Monty Panesar is deadly accurate, but he needs bounce to help him. If he doesn't get that bounce he lacks the variation to trouble the top Indian batters. Look at the way he was outbowled by Shaun Udal at Mumbai in 2006, when Udal took four cheap wickets to help bowl India out for 100. Udal has some batting pedigree himself, which is why he knew the importance of variations. Graeme Swann could be useful, and he has the advantage of turning the ball into India's right-handers but, again, I wonder how many variations he has.</p> <p>The other thing that puzzles me is the continued absence of the Essex wicketkeeper James Foster. When I was involved in the England side, he broke his finger at just the wrong time because I always felt he had the strength of character to deserve a place in the Test team. As it is, the decision to pick Tim Ambrose suggests to me they're still not sure who their No1 keeper is. They should have made their mind up by now but for me the answer is Matt Prior.</p> <p>He was dealt with harshly when he was dropped after last year's tour of Sri Lanka and the comparisons with Alec Stewart overlooked the fact that Stewart had tricky moments in his career when they couldn't decide whether he should keep wicket or open the batting. Comparisons always seem to be made with players who were at their peak rather than those who were just starting out. Stewart worked in the end because England stuck with him.</p> <p>The decision to go with Owais Shah ahead of Ravi Bopara was no more than 50-50 but it is hard to argue with because he did well in India last time, even though he wasn't properly fit. I would say, though, that England have to beware the old horses-for-courses trap: Shah could do well in India because he's a good player of spin then struggle in conditions elsewhere with the ball seaming around more. In the long run I have no doubt Bopara will get his chance.</p> <p>I would just like to add a word of congratulations to Durham for winning their first-ever County Championship. Of all the administrations I used to visit during my regular tours of the counties, they impressed me the most both with their off-field organisation and commitment and the quality of their facilities. </p> <p>Their chief executive, David Harker, deserves a lot of praise. I hope one or two of the more dinosaur-like counties take note.</p>",
  "<p>Jimmy White, who only narrowly avoided relegation from the circuit last season, maintained his encouraging start to the new campaign by beating the 19-year-old Chinese Xiao Guodong 5-2 on the opening day of the Shanghai Masters. </p> <p>Through winning eight of his nine matches in qualifying competitions at Prestatyn, the 46-year-old Londoner has restored some of his shattered confidence and made a break of 102, three further half-centuries and few unforced errors as he emphatically reversed his 5-0 defeat by Xiao last season. </p> <p>There were also wins for Anthony Hamilton, Ricky Walden, Judd Trump, Andy Hicks, Stuart Pettman and Tom Ford.</p>",
  "<p>President McCain or President Obama? Who do the Tories support in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselections2008\">US election</a>? These intriguing questions attracted a full house to a breakfast time fringe meeting at the Tory conference in Birmingham today. And it soon became clear that, for many Tories, the answer is not necessarily the obvious one.</p> <p>Two years ago, John McCain jetted across the Atlantic to speak at the Tory conference in Bournemouth, David Cameron's first as leader. He was not at that time \u2013 even before the 2006 midterms \u2013 even close to being the Republican nominee to succeed George Bush. McCain came as an outsider, and he spoke ineffectively and too long, failing to connect with his audience. It seemed in some ways an odd gamble for the new look Tories to take. Still, the link between McCain and the Tories seemed sufficiently strong to suppose that, if McCain actually emerged in 2008, he would be the Tories' man.</p> <p>And yet when, a year ago at the Tory conference in Blackpool, with the US presidential election still only a subject for political anoraks, I buttonholed <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/People/Peers/Neville-Jones_Pauline.aspx\">Pauline Neville-Jones</a>, the former chair of the joint intelligence committee turned Tory peer and shadow cabinet member, and asked her who she wanted to win the 2008 election, her answer was immediate: Hillary Clinton. We'll definitely be able to work with her, said Neville-Jones. Not like McCain or the neoconservatives.</p> <p>A year on, and now there has of course been another massive turn of the wheel in American politics. Clinton's moment has been and gone. Now Barack Obama is the frontrunner and McCain has overturned the odds on the Republican side. He has nominated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> as his running mate. So where do the Tories stand amid all this change?</p> <p>Instinctively, I think most would prefer McCain to Obama. The reason is not complicated. Tribes of the right stick together. Yet Palin has shaken some of that resolve. Whenever her name was mentioned at the fringe meeting, there were intakes of breath and shakings of the head. Not many 2008 Tories, even the elderly ones, feel at ease with an anti-abortion, anti-climate change, pro-gun, religious conservative with zero experience of international politics. Here, as in America itself, the choice of Palin has led a lot of moderate conservatives to question McCain's judgment.</p> <p>Six weeks ago, I bumped into the shadow cabinet member <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/francismaude\">Francis Maude</a> at the Democratic convention in Denver. Are you heading to the Republican convention next week, I asked him. Not me, he responded. We are the insurgents and so are the Democrats. The Republicans and Labour are the incumbents. This is the conference for us to learn from.</p> <p>Maude was there again in Birmingham on Monday morning. This time he was more circumspect. I have a preference, he said, but not in public. But I have a prediction, he added \u2013 that John McCain will win in 2008, will serve a single term as president and that the 2012 contest will be between Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin. \"Book your seats now,\" said Maude.</p> <p>That was one of two good lines to come out of an otherwise inconclusive fringe. The other \u2013 and I record this merely for the benefit of posterity and the compilers of dictionaries of political quotes \u2013 came from Richard Nixon. No, Tricky Dicky wasn't back from the grave to be with us in Birmingham today. But his son-in-law Ed Cox, the very much alive chairman of the McCain campaign in New York, was. One of McCain's virtues, in Cox's view, was that he is a staunch free trader. \"My father-in-law always used to say 'Free trade is good policy but bad politics',\" Cox recalled. Head and heart always did have an uneasy relationship in Nixon's politics. And the same is true for the Tories when they look at the contest between McCain and Obama. I think a lot of them would be comfortable with McCain \u2013 but I also think they suspect Obama would be the right choice.</p>",
  "<p>How many times can Phoenix reinvent itself before it lies dead in the ashes? Since its founding in 1983 the Leeds-based company has been through at least half a dozen artistic directors, and just as many changes of identity - from being an all-black, all-male troupe, to a company of mixed race and gender, and finally (to most people's relief) to a company in which colour and sex were no longer an issue.</p> <p>Now the news has broken that Phoenix has undergone yet another convulsion, with the sacking of its current director and resident choreographer Javier de Frutos.</p> <p>As Phoenix' s choreographer, De Frutos was always going to attract controversy. Even though some of his creations for the company have been highly acclaimed, others - like the hair-raisingly violent Los Picadoros - have sharply divided critical and public opinion. But as a director De Frutos had put some indisputably smart strategies in place. After his highly successful revivals of modern dance classics by Jane Dudley and Limon, he was deep into planning a revival of the fabulously strange early Paul Taylor classic 3 Epitaphs plus a newly commissioned work from golden boy Christopher Wheeldon.</p> <p>All this was establishing Phoenix as one of Britain's most interesting and entertaining dance companies. And not only that, De Frutos was putting Phoenix on the international map with extensive foreign tours plus a recent headlining appearance at the Venice Biennale.</p> <p>All in all, an impressive two years. Yet none of this seems to have impressed Phoenix's board. Aside from the absurd fact that according to De Frutos one member apparently found his works a \"bit poofy\", and the more practical concern that the more ambitious and costly of his plans were making the board jittery, the main reason De Frutos was given for his removal was that under his direction Phoenix had ceased to be a sufficiently \"black\" company. Even though De Frutos is himself Venezuelan and the rest of his company are a completely representative, urban, ethnic mix, Leeds seem to want to put back the clock to the time when Phoenix was a \"flagship\" black company.</p> <p>No one would deny that black talent in this country still needs encouraging. There are shockingly few black dancers in our ballet companies and even in modern dance black dancers and choreographers remain under-represented. But if it's true that Leeds want Phoenix to revert to an all-black company, or even one with a conscious policy of favouring black dancers, that can't be the answer. The board only need to look back though the company's history to see why. Every time Phoenix has tried to make that formula stick, the level of its choreography, and even of its performances has floundered. The company starts to look provincial in the worst possible ways. It starts to look like a company that's all about the social policy, not about the art.</p>"
