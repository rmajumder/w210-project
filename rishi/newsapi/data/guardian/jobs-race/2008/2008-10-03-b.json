  "<p>She had the look of a champion when running away with the Prix Marcel Boussac, France's top race for two-year-old fillies, on Arc day a year ago. Everything Zarkava has done since then has confirmed the view, and she returns to Longchamp tomorrow to defend an unbeaten record in the world's richest turf race.</p> <p>History is against Zarkava. No filly has won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe since Urban Sea in 1993, and no three-year-old filly since Akiyda 11 years earlier. But it is a long time since one of the quality of Zarkava has taken on the colts over Longchamp's mile and a half.</p> <p>Zarkava is unbeaten in six starts, winning the French 1,000 Guineas and Oaks in effortless fashion before taking a midsummer break, the favoured route to the Arc for French trainers. Alain de Royer-Dupr\u00e9, who has prepared Zarkava so skilfully, left something to work on for the filly's return to action in last month's Prix Vermeille.</p> <p>On her first attempt over the Arc distance, Zarkava showed the same brilliance she had displayed at shorter trips. Despite forfeiting ground at the start, she picked off her rivals with ease in the home straight and equalled the record time for the Vermeille without being extended.</p> <p>The opposition tomorrow will be a deal tougher, and supporters of Zarkava will not want to see her repeat her sleepy start from stall one - something she has never done before. But if jockey Christophe Soumillon has to get serious with Zarkava for the first time, the filly gives the impression she has lots more to offer.</p> <p>Assessing Zarkava's chance on form against the colts is not easy. But it is significant that the filly Natagora could finish third, a length and a half behind Vision d'Etat, in the French Derby. By my calculations, Natagora is around nine lengths inferior to Zarkava.</p> <p>Three-year-olds have won 11 of the last 14 runnings of the Arc, but last year Aidan O'Brien won with the four-year-old Dylan Thomas, who was in his eighth race of the season, and in Duke Of Marmalade and Soldier Of Fortune he is represented by similarly battle-hardened colts this year.</p> <p>Soldier Of Fortune, fifth last year when Dylan Thomas just denied Youmzain, would benefit from soft ground; Duke Of Marmalade is best on a faster surface. He had a hard race when rallying to beat Papal Bull in the King George at Ascot in July, which perhaps showed in his workmanlike win in the controversial International at Newmarket next time.</p> <p>Stable jockey Johnny Murtagh will switch from Duke Of Marmalade to Soldier Of Fortune if soft ground rules out the former, but the Longchamp ground is unlikely to become testing. Soldier Of Fortune is a solid performer, but seemed to have his limitations exposed when beaten by Youmzain at Saint-Cloud in June.</p> <p>Getaway had not been with Andr\u00e9 Fabre long when finishing fourth in last year's race. Fabre has trained seven Arc winners and Getaway, who returned to form last time out, may be the one to chase home <strong>Zarkava (3.40)</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>Just after ten this morning, Mayor Johnson arrived in the well of City Hall, accompanied by a small group of mostly elderly black men. Medals were pinned to the suits and military uniforms of latter, who wandered, chatting, with Johnson around a display of photographs and tales of valour and dedication. </p> <p>The \"<a href=\"http://www.wewerethere.defencedynamics.mod.uk/wewerethere_old/index.html\">We Were There</a>\" exhibition is a Ministry of Defence project whose patriotic theme enabled The Blond to make a gracious Conservative accommodation with his <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/bhm/\">Black History Season</a>, an institution some readers of his Daily Telegraph columns undoubtedly deride as an example of \"political correctness gone mad.\"</p> <p>We heard from Laurie Philpot, curator of the West Indian Ex-Servicemen Association, who'd joined the RAF in 1943, and from Frank Eastman, a serving solider with medals from Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. He explained that \"We Were There\" existed partly to \"enhance diversity training\" in the services and partly to disprove an assertion once made by the late Bernard Manning that no Asians had fought for Britain in the last war. </p> <p>Then Mayor Johnson spoke. He told a story of attending a primary school play in which his daughter had the role of Queen Victoria. Her one line was to pay tribute to Crimean War nurses <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/famouspeople/standard/nightingale/index.shtml\">Florence Nightingale</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/famouspeople/standard/seacole/index.shtml\">Mary Seacole</a>. Mayor Johnson confessed that he hadn't at the time heard of the second of these. \"I wondered if she'd been conjured up by politically correct people and just been invented,\" he explained. \"But I went back and I looked at the pages of history and I discovered how completely wrong I was.\"</p> <p>There was a moral to this tale. \"Mary Seacole, in my childhood, had been lost...either through ignorance or prejudice or whatever. And it was only thanks to the efforts of historians - serious historians, many of them black - that she was rediscovered, and is now properly celebrated by children in primary schools today.\"</p> <p>Spoken, I felt, albeit with the wrong sort of accent, like a Marxist multiculturalist and toxic relativist of the type his soon-to-be policy director <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2008/08/15/exclusive-boris-aide-s-book-on-sale-in-bnp-gift-shop-115875-20697513/\">Anthony Browne</a> seems to regard as a besmircher of national identity and an enemy of social unity. The mayor concluded: \"The more we know and understand our history, the better we know and understand our wonderful diverse Britain of today.\"</p> <p>A more coherent argument for a trendy, far-left revisionist approach to our great nation's past would be hard to imagine. And now journalists were invited to ask questions. Sadly, but not at all surprisingly, those most fervently tendered did not concern ethnic minority military heroism, but yesterday's resignation by Sir Ian Blair. Why hadn't Mayor Johnson consulted the Home Secretary before acting? Why was he playing party politics with the capital's policing?</p> <p>As the old soldiers looked on, Sir Ian's nemesis insisted that there'd been \"no party political element to this\" and finessed that he'd \"consulted widely.\" Then he hurried off, leaving me to reflect on the more ideological of the many hostile reasons offered for Sir Ian to vacate Scotland Yard. Too liberal. Too multiculturalist. Too \"politically correct.\" Well, we wouldn't want that sort of thing round here.</p>",
  "<p>A disgraced classics teacher who secretly filmed a pupil having sex on a school trip was given a subsequent teaching job at an independent school because the head felt he deserved \"a second chance\", it emerged today. </p> <p>Michael Clarkson was found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct and struck off the teaching register this week after the General Teaching Council heard he twice allowed a Shrewsbury school pupil to use his hotel room to sleep with a girl he met at a nightclub. </p> <p>Clarkson secretly filmed the 2006 encounter in Portugal, the GTC heard. But just five months after the video incident, Clarkson was given a job at Dean Close school, in Cheltenham, with its headteacher \u2013 a prominent independent schools' leader - in full knowledge of the \"serious mistake\". </p> <p>Clarkson, in his 30s, remained at the \u00a326,000-a-year school in Gloucestershire for nearly two years before resigning this July ahead of the conduct hearing. </p> <p>In a statement to the GTC, Dean Close's headmaster the Rev Tim Hastie-Smith, currently chairman of the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference that represents 250 private schools, said: \"Dean Close believes in offering forgiveness and giving people a second chance and Mr Clarkson demonstrated in his conscientious approach to all aspects of his role that he has put a most regrettable incident behind him.\" </p> <p>Hastie-Smith admitted knowing Clarkson for 10 years, and said he felt the voyeuristic actions were \"out of character\". </p> <p>The pupils had \"benefited greatly\" from their time with the \"talented schoolmaster\", he added in his statement. </p> <p>The stepfather of the 17-year-old victim said he had called Dean Close in disbelief as soon as he heard of Clarkson's appointment. </p> <p>He told the Gloucestershire Echo: \"I think it's ridiculous. Anyone who has put themselves in a position where they have abused the trust of children should never be employed in that position again. </p> <p>\"I want to make sure people like this are taken out of the education system.\" </p> <p>A parent at Dean Close said he was \"astounded\" by Clarkson's appointment. </p> <p>Another outraged mother said: \"There shouldn't be any second chances where children are concerned.\" </p> <p>A source close to the school told the paper the appointment had caused \"unrest\" among teachers, as not every member of staff was fully aware of his past. </p> <p>Dean Close said it was confident no pupil was put at risk during Clarkson's tenure, during which he taught classics to years 9-13, and refereed rugby. </p> <p>The co-educational boarding school has 492 pupils in its senior school, and counts the Rolling Stones founder member Brian Jones among its old boys. </p> <p>Clarkson resigned from Dean Close in July ahead of the conduct hearing, which told him he could apply to be put back on the register in four years' time. </p> <p>The GTC heard that Clarkson organised the Portuguese holiday in April 2006. It was attended by 29 pupils from the then all-male Shrewsbury school, and he was the most senior of six staff members present. </p> <p>The hearing in Birmingham heard that Clarkson let the 17-year-old use his room twice to have sex because there was someone in his own. </p> <p>When the pupil spotted the video camera lens above the bed, Clarkson tried to laugh it off. </p> <p>The boy confronted the teacher following the incident and Clarkson apologised, saying it was just a silly joke. </p> <p>Clarkson was suspended after his return to Shrewsbury. The pupil was interviewed by police in May 2006 but no charges were brought. </p> <p>Due to the boy's age, the matter was not regarded as a child protection issue and police took no action, freeing Clarkson to teach at Dean Close. </p> <p>Clarkson, who was not present at the hearing, was found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct.</p>"
