  "<p>In the aftermath of the Wall Street meltdown, HBO's Bill Maher has made a plea on behalf of John McCain and other rich white people: \"I think the recent news from Wall Street has made us all less tolerant and only reinforced the stereotype that white people are shiftless, thieving welfare queens.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0iM0mUfATJk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/0iM0mUfATJk&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/0iM0mUfATJk&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object> </figure>",
  "<p>What if you started a television season and nobody watched? From behemoths such as Heroes to new shows such as <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1119644/\">Fringe</a>, US television is in the middle of a ratings freefall as viewers turn away from escapist dramas and tune into politics instead. </p> <p>All the superpowers in the world aren't enough to make people stop worrying in times like these and some of America's biggest hits have suffered - on ABC <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413573/\">Grey's Anatomy</a> drew 17% fewer viewers to its season premiere this year, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0805669/\">Ugly Betty</a> was down 15% while NBC's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/heroes/\">Heroes</a>, coming off the back of a much-criticised second season, slumped 29% from 14.1 million to 10 million viewers.</p> <p>Then there's the lack of excitement surrounding the season's new shows. The biggest of them all, JJ Abrams' so-so Fringe, which starts in Britain on Sky One this Sunday, is a sort of supernatural CSI with the odd good one liner and a likeable cast. It's OK, if a bit uneven, but compared with NBC's plodding new <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Rider_(2008_film)\">Knight Rider</a> spin-off or the fast-fading <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/sep/05/ustelevision.television\">90210 remake</a>, it looks like a work of genius. </p> <p>As for those ratings, they're currently at 8.1 million. It's a respectable viewing figure albeit not the overwhelming hit Fox desired. Instead the season's biggest hopes now rest on CBS's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1196946/\">The Mentalist</a> (which despite the lost-in-translation title is a fun detective tale in the Bones mould) although this could all change when the much-hyped Christian Slater's double agent drama My Own Worst Enemy airs on October 13 on NBC. And it's not all doom and gloom, cable still has a couple of interesting debuts \u2013 HBO's <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/trueblood/\">True Blood</a> is both clever and witty, FX's <a href=\"http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/soa/\">Sons of Anarchy</a> is compelling in a slightly unpleasant way - but it's still fair to say that most of the new shows have failed to catch light.</p> <p>Then there are last year's new shows. The writer's strike meant that many of the supposed hits of 2007 failed to cement their place in viewer's hearts and thus this season is almost a chance to start all over again. Hopes are high, for example, that the twee <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushing_Daisies\">Pushing Daisies</a> on NBC will win more fans with a less winsome tone while amiable nerd dramas <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0934814/\">Chuck</a> on NBC and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaper_(TV_series)\">Reaper</a> on The CW get another chance to attract their slacker (and somewhat slack) fans; by contrast ABC's <a href=\"http://abc.go.com/primetime/dirtysexymoney/index\">Dirty Sexy Money</a> appears to have thrown the baby out with the bathwater by hiring the showrunner from the execrable <a href=\"http://abc.go.com/fallpreview/bigshots/index\">Big Shots</a> and abandoning wit in favour of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty_(TV_series)\">Dynasty</a> levels of camp melodrama. </p> <p>And even these reboots are failing to alleviate an overwhelming sense of gloom. Yes, The CW's buzzy <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397442/\">Gossip Girl</a> is still generating buzz and yes, it's easy to attach too much importance to ratings in these days of downloads, <a href=\"http://www.tivo.com/\">TIVO</a>, on demand, and streaming but it's still hard to remember a TV season generating less excitement than this one, with no single show attracting widespread acclaim and a sense that people really are switching off their televisions to do something more interesting instead.</p> <p>Still, there is one silver lining for the ratings-obsessed industry. Cable news channels are seeing an overwhelming rise in interest as across America people switch the dials on their televisions from light-hearted escapism to find out the cold hard facts with 52.7 million people watching the first presidential debate between Senators <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/johnmccain\">McCain</a>.<br> Political comedy is also enjoying a bounce: <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/\">Saturday Night Live</a> has seen its ratings shoot through the roof, largely because of Tina Fey's entertaining impersonation of Governor <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a>, while Comedy Central's <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/\">The Daily Show</a> drew its highest ratings ever last week, up 28% on its yearly average. In fact maybe instead of despairing we should all be relieved. After all, if America is shrugging off its apathy to focus on the political, surely the premature deaths of a couple of dramas is a small price to pay?</p>",
  "<p>Bullet points just don't work. We've all chewed our fists in frustration as the 150th bullet appears in a presentation. We've all felt our hearts sink when faced with another report crammed with black dots. Bullets don't impress people; they depress people. </p> <p>Are bullet points really to blame, though? We don't blame the biro if people write badly. But biros help people write without hindering their ability to write well; bullets hinder because they lack structure. They seem to encourage flabby thinking and writing, and are poor at lifting key points from the page. </p> <p>People think bullets break up dull text. They don't: they are themselves dull text. </p> <p>This all leads to bad decisions. Apparently, managers often use intuition to reach decisions, and then look selectively at information to support their hunch. I'm not surprised: they can't make sense of the bullet-riddled nonsense they're sent. </p> <p>In the movie <a href=\"http://www.whenharrymetsallythemovie.com/\">When Harry Met Sally</a>, Meg Ryan made the head spin when ordering dessert. In today's bullet-obsessed world, someone would \"helpfully clarify\" her words by doing them in bullets:</p> <p>\u0095 But I'd like the pie heated, and I don't want the ice cream on top. I want it on the side. <br>\u0095 And I'd like strawberry instead of vanilla, if you have it<br>\u0095 If not, then no ice cream, just whipped cream - but only if it's real<br>\u0095 If it's out of a can, then just the pie, but then not heated.</p> <p>If you think bullets aren't this bad in real life, you're right: often, they are worse. Many people wouldn't even do these four bullets. Instead, they'd proclaim: \"I've highlighted the key dessert issues for us to talk through when we meet:\" <br> <br>\u0095 Cream: real or out of can? <br>\u0095 Ice cream: strawberry or vanilla? <br>\u0095 Position of cream or ice cream: on top on side?<br>\u0095 Pie: hot or cold?</p> <p>It's lazy thinking because the bullets don't think through the interrelationships between alternatives nor relate them to outcomes. As I said, dots are for Dalmatians, not documents.</p> <p>But what are the alternatives to bullets? Actually, there are quite a lot. Here are just a few examples. </p> <p>In slides, imagery is a popular alternative, but it isn't effective in reports. Your report can't just be 20 pictures: any serious alternative to bullets must cope with words and detail. </p> <p>So if your situation is of the \"if this, then that; if that, then the other\" variety (<a href=\"http://www.jmoon.co.uk/documents/bookdownloads/4.22_WhenHarryMetSally%28File35%29.ppt\">like Meg's</a>), then maybe try a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree\">decision tree</a>. If you're reviewing pros and cons or alternatives, try a <a href=\"http://www.which.magazine.co.uk/?jchk=1&amp;nolog=1&amp;CMP=KNC-GOOGLE&amp;HBX_PK=Jellyfish&amp;HBX_OU=50&amp;jtid=12967661&amp;source_code=1LU08W\">comparison table</a>, like the ones they do in Which? magazine. And for day-to-day text or slides, try <a href=\"http://www.jmoon.co.uk/documents/ReportBeforeV2.pdf\">Words in Tables</a>, my alternative to bullets. </p> <p>I do appreciate that I could have done the above paragraph as a decision tree.</p> <p>Bullet points have a lot to answer for. I won't claim that bullets caused the credit crunch, but I will say that they played their part in failing to stop it. So, in the interests of clarity, impact and better decisions, please join my campaign to Make Work Pointless.</p>"
