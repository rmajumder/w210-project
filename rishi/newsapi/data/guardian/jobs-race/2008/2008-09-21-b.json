  "<p>The speakers at yesterday's Fabian event at Manchester Town Hall sat behind the blown-up front cover of the current <a href=\"http://fabians.org.uk/publications/fabian-review\">Fabian Review</a>: \"Must Labour Lose?'\" Next to it was the title of the debate: \"Can we give the white working class what they want?\"</p> <p>The two questions are not unrelated. Alan Johnson may <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4791039.ece\">joke</a> that the Conservatives have gone from a party of proud Etonians and closet homosexuals to closet Etonians and proud homosexuals, but that does not alter the fact that the white working class has grown disillusioned with Labour. The broad coalition that brought Labour to power in 1997 has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/23/labour.crewebyelection08\">disintegrated</a> under Gordon Brown, and lower socio-economic groups have deserted Labour in the greatest numbers.</p> <p>Two competing theories for the desertion emerged from the session; one emphasised the heart and the other stressed the wallet. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/joncruddas\">Jon Cruddas</a>, MP for Barking and Dagenham, argued that what has been called the \"epic flight of the white working class\" is the consequence of a political strategy that fails to focus on the issues that the white working class face. This, he suggested, was because of New Labour's assumption that the knowledge-based economy would wither away the white working class.</p> <p>Skills and universities secretary John Denham broadly agreed. \"The two areas of the country that have the lowest skills base are Stoke and Barking and Dagenham,\" he told the audience, \"and those are two of the areas where the far right are strongest. This is about the people who have been least able to manage the huge changes \u2013 such as global forces and migration \u2013 that have taken place in society.\" TUC general secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/brendanbarber\">Brendan Barber</a> said migration had driven down standards and undercut established conditions for working people. But <a href=\"http://fabians.org.uk/images/stories/fabian_review_autumn_trickett_for_web.pdf\">Jon Trickett</a>, MP for Hemsworth, suggested there is a \"cultural and linguistic gap\" between the government and the white working class. And, he went on, the government ignored this group at its peril. He cited a <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2005/rp05-033.pdf\">study</a> of the ten most marginal seats in the country which revealed that social groups D and E outnumber skilled manual workers (C2) by a factor of two to one. It was therefore essential to reach these disaffected ex-Labour supporters. How to do it?</p> <p>For <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2005/rp05-033.pdf\">communities secretary</a> Hazel Blears, it was to stress that Labour was the party that stood for personal gain rather than only philanthropic altruism; that it was the party that gave working people the chance to have some of the things that the middle class took for granted. To win back the white working class, the government had to tell them that if they \"work hard we'll help you get on, live by the rules and we'll protect you from those who don't, make your contribution and we'll give you good services, strive to be good parents and we'll provide good schools and a chance to get your kids to university. And when times are tough we'll use every tool we have to protect you and your family.\"</p> <p>This failed to convince journalist <a href=\"http://www.liberalconspiracy.org/\">Sunny Hundal</a>, who suggested that white working class disaffection called for war on two fronts \u2013 one to argue against claims that they are losing out in the battle of resources, and the second a cultural war \"about the identity of our country and where it is going, a fight about symbols and a sense of community and what is the glue that binds us as a nation.\"</p> <p>I was struck by the fact that during this entire discussion none of the speakers used the word \"immigration\". It was left to the very last questioner during the Q&amp;A session to raise it and suggest that Labour was not tackling \"legitimate fears in a pragmatic way\". This, it seems to me, was a critical question. Trying to find the right language to address white worries can only happen when there is sufficient recognition that the decline in Labour support among the white working class is related to immigration's impact on their lives and the way they feel about living in Britain. Immigration was, Cruddas conceded, the \"prism through which everything else is seen\" \u2013 but how it has affected the white working class, a theme that the BBC examined in a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/white/\">series of films</a>, was not fully addressed; it remains, you could say, the white elephant in the room.<br></p>"
