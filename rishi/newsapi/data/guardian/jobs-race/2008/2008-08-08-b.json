  "<p>One of the music industry's most talented square pegs, Steve Mason has spent the past decade looking for the right project and the right audience. As the songwriter behind the Beta Band, his expansive and mildly surreal songwriting provided - in those grandiose days of Be Here Now and Urban Hymns - an entirely absent quality: charm. Sadly, that project neither made the band famous, nor entirely allowed an outlet for Mason's various influences, and since then he has explored other avenues: the great King Biscuit Time and, lately, Black Affair. This is a project with an element of the cold war dancefloor, circa 1982: all dry handclaps, Kraftwerk references and belted raincoats. Duly, the new album Pleasure Pressure Point flirts with kitsch, but Mason keeps things on the right track, the balance of power between New Order and Visage just about equitable.</p>",
  "<p>The new head of the Scottish Funding Council is to be Mark Batho, a Holyrood civil servant, it emerged today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336356918\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/08/08/MarkBatho310.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Batho, new head of the Scottish Funding Council\" width=\"220\" height=\"310\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Batho, new head of the Scottish Funding Council</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scottish Funding Council/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Batho, currently director of lifelong learning at the Scottish government and previously head of its social justice group, takes over as chief executive next month.</p> <p>The funding council is responsible for universities and further education colleges in Scotland, and allocates \u00a31.6bn a year to the country's 20 higher education institutions and 43 colleges.</p> <p>Since devolution, Scottish universities have enjoyed a higher level of spending for each student than those in England or Wales. Batho's appointment comes at a time, however, when universities are concerned about competing for staff and research contracts with English institutions able to call on student tuition fees, which do not apply north of the border.</p> <p>A career civil servant since graduating from St Andrews University in 1979, Batho lives in Edinburgh and is married with three children. </p> <p>Welcoming the appointment, John McClelland, who chairs the SFC, said: \"Mark takes over a key role within Scotland at an important time. His past experience in engaging with a wide range of stakeholders and his detailed understanding of the sectors will be valuable attributes in supporting his leadership of the council's future progress.\"<br> The Higher Education Funding Council for England is searching for a new chief executive to replace Professor David Eastwood when he moves to become vice-chancellor of Birmingham University in April. An announcement is expected in October or November.</p>",
  "<p>It's great that L'Oreal has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/08/advertising.usa?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=media\">publicly denied</a> that it had deliberately tried to make Beyonc\u00e9 appear whiter in its latest campaign: however, \"bleaching\" is still a huge issue for young women around the world.</p> <p>The 27-year-old singer, who has an African American father and Creole mother, is naturally light-skinned, with dark brown hair, but appears with very pale skin and strawberry blonde hair as the face of L'Oreal. She appears, if not exactly \"white\" then definitely racially ambiguous. It is a tactic <a href=\"http://www.beyonceonline.com/\">Beyonc\u00e9</a> appears to have used herself previously \u2013 perhaps to make her image more commercial. Her trademark has been very long blonde hair extensions and yes, looking as light as possible. Whether or not this was her actual intention, her commercial success is undeniable. Beyond her endorsements, as a solo artist she has sold many millions of albums and singles worldwide, dwarfing the solo earnings of other members of the Grammy-winning girl group Destiny's Child, who incidentally are much darker.</p> <p>This is not the first time advertisers have been accused of white-washing. There was uproar when the black \"Halifax man\", appeared to have become progressively lighter and his voice was dubbed. Halifax denied the accusation. Then there was the infamous Ford company photo where black faces were simply changed to white. Ford apologised.</p> <p>But the problem goes beyond the airbrushing and whitewashing of global corporations. \"Bleaching\" is a huge industry in developing countries. This legacy of slavery or colonization, where lighter-skinned or white people were given visible privileges over hundreds of years has resulted in societies where the lighter you are, the higher your status socially and economically. In <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/skinwhitening-adverts-ignite-race-row-in-india-863936.html\">India</a>, women strive to achieve the \"wheat\" colour much-requested on Asian dating websites. In the Caribbean, light skin is also highly desired while in African countries even seemingly minor variations in skin tone can contribute to ethnic conflict.</p> <p>Containing the active ingredients hydroquinone and/or mercury, bleaching creams have been linked with the disfiguring condition ochronosis, marked by the darkening and thickening of the skin, as well as the appearance of tiny dome-shaped bumps and greyish-brown spots, according to the US FDA which <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/E6-14263.htm\">proposed a ban</a> on skin-lightening creams without a prescription back in 2006. In the UK, the amount of hydroquinone allowed in retail skin-lightening creams has been limited to just 2% but demand means there is a ready unofficial market for stronger potions. Ironically, skin-lightening creams are often a misnomer, since after discontinuing use, normal sun exposure can make you darker than before. Women can then become psychologically addicted to creams and over years destroy not just their complexions, but also their health and self-esteem.</p> <p>Marketers are well aware of how a \"white\" or \"black\" face on packaging can affect sales. The purpose of the recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jun/20/fashion.usa\">Italian Vogue issue</a> featuring completely black models was mainly to combat the widely held perception that black faces \"don't sell\". However, advertisers may not be aware of how younger girls are influenced by images of women being airbrushed ever lighter, skinnier, blonder. L'Oreal have denied that their actions were deliberate, but nevertheless yet another message, that the whiter you are the more successful you will be, has been sent.</p>",
  "<p>Tottenham target Andrei Arshavin has revealed his frustration at the delay over his proposed move to White Hart Lane, and revealed that he hopes his unhappiness will lead to Zenit St Petersburg dropping their asking price. \"My desire to leave is still as strong, but there is nothing more to do now other than hope for a miracle,\" Arshavin said. \"I understand perfectly well that if I don't move on now, I probably never will. I'm just hoping that one fine morning the bosses at Gazprom will wake up in a good mood and say: 'We've had enough of Arshavin's whining - let's let him go'.\"</p> <p>The UEFA Cup holders have rejected formal bids from Barcelona and Tottenham for the 27-year-old, and have placed a \u20ac27m (\u00a319.6m) price-tag on his head, but despite failing to agree a fee with Zenit, Arshavin revealed that he has already held talks with Spurs manager Juande Ramos. \"When Tottenham made their offer I was sceptical at first,\" Arshavin said. \"But after Ramos called me personally and told me that that they were selling Robbie Keane and that he wanted me in his side, the situation changed. When a coach shows an interest in you, especially such a renowned and strong coach, then that is already half of the success of any move. I also like the way Tottenham play, so I agreed in principle to join.\"</p> <p>The star of Russia's run to the semi-final of Euro 2008 claimed that he has already agreed personal terms with the London club, and is excited about playing for a side who can push for a Champions League place. \"Tottenham have a decent squad with (Luka) Modric, (Dimitar) Berbatov and other players, and the club is fully capable of fighting for a place in the Champions League,\" he said. \"The main thing is to try my strengths in a league like the English Premier League and play against the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal on a regular basis rather than once every five years.\"</p> <p>Zenit coach Dick Advocaat was firm in his belief that if Tottenham are determined to buy Arshavin, then they will have to pay the full amount. \"If Tottenham can sell Robbie Keane to Liverpool for \u20ac25m then in my opinion they should pay good money for Arshavin,\" he said.</p>"
