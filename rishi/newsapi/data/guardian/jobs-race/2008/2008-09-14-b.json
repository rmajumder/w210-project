  "<p>Senior police advisers and community leaders warned yesterday that youth violence was spiralling out of control on inner-city streets after another teenager was killed in London. Oliver King-Onzila became the 26th teenager to be murdered in the capital this year when he was knifed outside a bar on Saturday. </p> <p>The killing means that teenage homicides in the first nine months of this year already equal the number for all of 2007 in the Metropolitan police area. Since 2000, the number of teenagers killed on the capital's streets has risen year on year.</p> <p>Sir Ian Blair, the Met police commissioner, said during a spate of killings last year that the violence among young people was \"completely unacceptable\" and he was \"not prepared to tolerate this continued sequence of senseless killings\". But despite a high-profile police presence on the streets and more stops and searches, the number of stabbings has risen. </p> <p>King-Onzila, 19, who captained Barnet's youth football team, died in a fracas outside the E Bar in Croydon, south London. Barnet's manager, Paul Fairclough, described him as \"a gentle giant\". </p> <p>Cindy Butts, a deputy chair of the Metropolitan police authority and specialist in gun and knife crime, said: \"I think we must brace ourselves. It is like an arms race ... The more young people are aware that other young people are carrying knives, the more likely they will be to carry one.\" </p> <p>Raymond Stevenson, a community leader in Brixton, said: \"Next year the figures will go up again because we are at the beginning of the spiral, not at the end.\" </p> <p>The rise in violence, particularly knife attacks, is reflected in the casualty units. In the first seven months of this year the Royal London hospital treated 150 victims with serious stab injuries, compared with 185 over the whole of last year. Across England, admissions for serious knife injuries have risen over the past five years, from 3,000 to more than 5,000.</p> <p>In London, police resources have been diverted to tackle knife crime, with some officers pulled off terrorist duties to join a 75-strong squad in high-risk areas. </p> <p>But Stevenson alleged that government \"neglect\" of urban areas gave young people \"the worst teachers in the most rundown schools, no after-school provision and no hope\". He said the \" underinvestment in urban communities is a national disaster\". His own violence awareness group, Urban Concepts, has had its Home Office funding withdrawn.</p>",
  "<p>Israel's ruling Kadima party votes on Wednesday for a new leader in an election that polls suggest will bring to power the foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, who would become the country's first female prime minister in more than 30 years.</p> <p>Her closest challenger is Shaul Mofaz, the transport minister, who is a hawkish former army chief that warned earlier this year that war with Iran, the country where he was born, was \"unavoidable\". If Mofaz wins he would become the first Israeli prime minister not born in Europe or descended from European immigrants.</p> <p>Around 70,000 party members will vote in what is Kadima's first primary. Two opinion polls published in newspapers on Friday put Livni ahead with around 46% of the vote, with Mofaz trailing by at least 14 points. The two other candidates, Avi Dichter, the internal security minister, and Meir Sheetrit, the tourism minister, are some way behind. </p> <p>However, with such a small electorate in a first-time party vote, Livni's victory is not guaranteed. The winner would need at least 40% of the vote in the first round to avoid a runoff between the top two candidates a week later. Even then, the new leader must endure what is likely to be a drawn-out period of horse trading as he or she tries to pull together a coalition government in Israel's often fractious political climate. If no coalition can be formed then general elections must be held, at the latest by early next year.</p> <p>Livni, 50, has been closely watched by political observers for many months and tipped as a future prime minister. Married with two sons, she was born into a right-wing political family: her father Eitan was a senior figure in the Irgun, the militant Zionist group led by Menachem Begin. She worked as an agent in Mossad, the foreign intelligence service, then became a lawyer before turning to politics. She was in the rightwing Likud party until she left with Ariel Sharon in 2005. </p> <p>She has been closely involved in the latest, year-long round of negotiations with the Palestinians, and many observers believe she would be more likely to continue the talks, with a goal of creating an independent state, than Mofaz. Last month, she warned she would not be hurried into a deal. Livni also takes a tough position on Iran and its nuclear ambitions. \"Time is of the essence ... Sanctions are effective but the current sanctions are not effective enough,\" she has said. </p> <p>Should Livni ascend to power, the demise of Ehud Olmert would follow. The current prime minister has said he would resign on Thursday if a new leader wins the first-round vote.</p>",
  "<p>Old Trafford and the Grand Final on October 4 is still a far-off horizon for Catalans Dragons but the possibilities for Super League's French representatives are endless if they can bottle their performance in humiliating Warrington and reproduce it in Saturday's second sudden-death encounter at home to Wigan.</p> <p>Perpignan and the Catalans region have embraced the Dragons but with journalists from all the main Paris newspapers turning up for the first time, the prediction of Christophe Levy, the club's general manager, that \"we'll hopefully be talked about by the whole of France over the next three years\" is not necessarily far-fetched. The word is spreading but unlike a comatose Warrington here on Saturday, Wigan will not conveniently lie down. In a febrile atmosphere at their intimidating ground, the Dragons' power to deliver cannot be under-estimated.</p> <p>Warrington were blown away by four tries to the Australian wing Justin Murphy, whose French citizenship is expected in December. \"The last time I got four was probably in the under-7s. The forwards got a roll on and the ball kept running my way,\" said Murphy, who is married to a Frenchwoman and will soon come off the club's overseas quota. </p> <p>Had Warrington followed the lead of their captain Adrian Morley, who spent the morning on an intravenous drip to assist his recovery from a pulled stomach muscle, they might have been competitive. However, once Murphy skipped clear from Thomas Bosc's superb delivery for his first try in the 19th minute, the Wolves rapidly subsided. James Lowes, who won seven of his first eight matches after succeeding Paul Cullen as coach but has no presided over five consecutive defeats, was downhearted but reluctant to criticise his players. \"I've an idea what's gone wrong, but I'd like to keep that within my team. Looking at the bigger picture, we just ran out of gas,\" he said.</p> <p>Catalans had won only one of their previous six games but looked to have saved themselves for the business end of the season. Casey McGuire, whose rotation between hooker and scrum- half bewildered Warrington, said: \"We'd switched off in defence the last couple of games. To concede just one try was the most pleasing aspect. Being at home is a massive advantage. The fans are very passionate and vocal. It's just a great atmosphere to play in and we're really excited about playing Wigan here.\"</p> <p>The combination of McGuire, Bosc and Adam Mogg at half-back ran rings around Warrington, whose lightweight bench had no answer to the contributions of Jamal Fakir, R\u00e9mi Casty and local hero J\u00e9r\u00f4me Guisset. The defending for Murphy's second score was abysmal and Bosc touched down and set up Dimitri Pelo for a try on half-time that killed the game off.</p> <p>Rather than resting on a 20-point lead, Catalans did not let up. McGuire was virtually waved through for a try in the 44th minute, John Wilson's precise kick led to Murphy's hat-trick score and Clint Greenshields, whose contribution at full-back is expected to be recognised in today's Dream Team announcement, set up Gr\u00e9gory Mounis on the left and added a try himself, before Murphy grabbed his fourth.</p> <p><strong>Catalans</strong> Greenshields; Murphy, Wilson, Raguin, Pelo; Mogg, Bosc; Chan, McGuire, Elima, Croker, Mounis, Carlaw. <strong>Interchange</strong> Guisset, Casty, Fakir, Baile.</p> <p><strong>Warrington</strong> Hicks; Riley, Gleeson, King, Penny; Briers, Monaghan; Morley, Clarke, Rauhihi, Westwood, Mitchell, Grix. <strong>Interchange</strong> Wood, Bracek, Cooper, Blythe.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> S Ganson (St Helens).</p> <h2>Road to Grand Final</h2> <p><strong>Qualifying semi-final</strong></p> <p><strong>St Helens v Leeds Sept 19</strong></p> <p><strong>Elimination semi-final Sept 20</strong></p> <p><strong>Wigan</strong> <strong>v Catalans Dragons</strong></p> <p><strong>Final eliminator Sept 26</strong></p> <p>Losers qualifying semi-final v </p> <p>Winners elimination semi-fina<strong>l</strong></p> <p><strong>Grand Final </strong>Old Trafford <strong>Oct 4</strong></p> <p>Winners qualifying semi-final v</p> <p>Winners final eliminator</p>",
  "<p>David Moyes may have stalled on signing a new contract at Goodison Park, but no one could accuse the Everton manager of lacking commitment. Sent to the stands in the second half for his furious response to Alan Wiley's bizarre decision to give a free-kick for handball after initially pointing to the penalty spot Moyes leapt to his feet at the final whistle, sprinted half the length of the pitch, tore off his sweater and, after pointing to the club crest, tossed it towards the euphoric travelling supporters. </p> <p>It was a gesture in keeping with a dramatic and breathless second period, during which Stoke, exploiting Rory Delap's ability to throw the ball huge distances with extraordinary pace and power, recovered from two goals down to leave Everton on their knees. </p> <p>There was a sense that the home team would prevail at that point, but four minutes after Moyes's spat with the fourth official Tim Cahill marked his first appearance since March with a near-post header to nudge Everton ahead again and steal three points. </p> <p>It was a sweet moment for Moyes after his touchline contretemps. \"I think maybe I was too strong in my views about the penalty,\" said the Everton manager, who had seen Wiley point to the spot when Leon Cort handled, before changing his mind after consulting the linesman. \"We had been 2-0 up and now it was 2-2 so it was a big moment for us not to get it. So I complained to the fourth official, as you would do if you think you're right and I said to the referee, if I was wrong I would apologise to him and if he was wrong I would expect the same.\" </p> <p>There was no need, with Wiley making a second blunder of the afternoon. Two minutes before Phil Jagielka headed Delap's long throw-in into his own net Ricardo Fuller had what appeared to be a perfectly good goal disallowed when he was penalised for fouling Joseph Yobo before sashaying round Tim Howard. The replays suggested Fuller had been too strong and quick for Yobo as he burst through the middle, although Moyes insisted the decision to penalise the Jamaican was the correct one. </p> <p>Having endured a difficult start to the season the Everton manager was entitled to feel a sense of satisfaction. Everton were far from dominant, but Stoke, with their high-tempo approach and set-piece prowess, are awkward opponents. </p> <p>\"Part of the secret is to keep the ball on the pitch against Stoke because when the ball goes out they become a real threat,\" said Moyes, who gave debuts to Marouane Fellaini and Segundo Castillo. \"Stoke have got a long throw which they deploy very well. It's like a human sling.\" </p> <p>Everton had done their homework, but knowing what is coming and knowing how to stop it are two different things as Aston Villa, vanquished here last month, will testify. Delap, who set up the winning goal against Villa, claimed two more assists yesterday, with Seyi Olofinjana volleying home after Tim Howard's weak punch and Jagielka, under pressure from Cort, glancing Stoke's equaliser beyond the Everton goalkeeper eight minutes later. \"It's part of the game. It's not unlawful to throw the ball in,\" said Tony Pulis, defending the tactic. </p> <p>The Stoke manager insisted his players would continue to \"work on\" Delap's long throw, although dedicating time to defending set pieces in the weeks to come may be just as beneficial. Stoke's weaknesses in that area were exposed at Bolton on the opening day of the season and Everton enjoyed more reward here, with Victor Anichebe arriving unmarked to glance in Mikel Arteta's free-kick in the 51st minute and Cahill nodding a corner from the Spaniard past Thomas Sorensen late on after losing his marker, Danny Higginbotham. </p> <p>Arteta was also involved in the first Everton goal, when he combined neatly with Cahill to set up Yakubu Ayegbeni four minutes before the break. There was still much for the Nigerian to do, but he shifted the ball adroitly from right foot to left before planting a low shot into the bottom corner from 12 yards. They should have had another chance to score from the same distance later in the game but Moyes did not appear to be dwelling on that moment when he left a steward in his slipstream to greet the jubilant Everton fans.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Mikel Arteta</p> <p>The Spaniard provided further evidence of his importance to Everton after being involved in all three goals. His accuracy from set-plays proved invaluable</p> <p><strong>Best moment </strong>His delivery for the second goal, when his inch-perfect free-kick invited Anichebe to score</p>",

Livni also takes a tough position on Iran and its nuclear ambitions. \"Time is of the essence \u2026 Sanctions are effective but the current sanctions are not effective enough,\" she has said. </p> <p>Some argue that in terms of the peace process with the Palestinians, it is the US elections that are likely to be more influential. \"The fact that we are not reaching agreement now, even a very general document, has to do with a lack of international involvement,\" said Akiva Eldar, chief political columnist at the Ha'aretz newspaper. \"We can get very close...but now you need a third party to put forward some ideas because it would be much easier for both sides to make concessions to the Americans than to each other.\"</p> <p>Ultimately, a future prime minister's strategy will also be shaped by their coalition partners. Kadima has 29 seats in the 120-seat Knesset and will need Labour's 19 seats as well as other smaller parties, not least among them Shas, an Orthodox religious party with 12 seats.If Livni cannot persuade Shas to join, she could turn to Arab MPs and Meretz, a left-wing party with five seats. </p> <p>She has even talked of enticing in the opposition Likud, though it is hard to see how this might happen.Should Livni ascend to power, the demise of Ehud Olmert would follow. The current prime minister has said he would resign on Thursday if a new leader wins the first-round vote.</p> <p>Olmert has been dogged by criticism of his handling of the 2006 war in Lebanon and now faces a raft of corruption investigations. Last week police recommended he face corruption charges, though it may be some months before the attorney general reaches a decision. Olmert might have to remain in office for some time, while the new party leader haggles over the coalition, but then he will would then step down, barely halfway through his term as prime minister.</p>"
