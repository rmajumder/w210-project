  "<p>Dalits, the \"untouchables\" at the bottom of the Hindu caste system, are the last to be rescued and are getting the smallest rations in the aftermath of the floods in north India, claim aid agencies working in the inundated villages.</p> <p>Even in the moment of greatest need the lowest castes, who traditionally eke out a living on the outer fringes of Indian society, have been subjected to \"relief discrimination\". Hundreds of thousands of people are huddling in relief camps after the Kosi river changed course in Bihar and swamped hundreds of square miles.</p> <p>\"We have seen that in districts such as Supaul and Madhepura that boats out rescuing people either take the lowest castes last or do not take them at all,\" said Anuradha Maharishi of Save the Children.</p> <p>\"We have also recorded instances where [Dalits] are not getting enough to eat. At the same time we have seen higher castes being rescued and getting supplies. It is unacceptable but a fact out there.\"</p> <p>In one camp, it was reported that a Dalit man had been rescued by boat because he was the village head man but that his family had not been picked up, despite promises that his wife, four children and the rest of the community would come later.</p> <p>\"It's been six days and since then no boat has come from the village,\" Mohan Parwan told the Associated Press. </p> <p>Another group of Dalits said that rescuers were saving the upper castes and the rich first, leaving their people to suffer without food and clean water.</p> <p>When India created its constitution in 1950, \"untouchability\" was made illegal. However, experts say the practice remains a degrading part of everyday life in Indian villages where the complex caste system remains all-pervasive.</p> <p>Dalits in rural areas are often bullied and assigned menial jobs such as manual scavengers, removing human waste and dead animals. </p> <p>There are frequent reports of untouchables being barred from temples or being beaten for transgressing the social order.</p> <p>However, commentators say that what is happening in Bihar is probably better than what went on in the past. </p> <p>\"In the past Dalits would not even have been rescued. They would have been left behind. In fact, the cattle would have been taken and the Dalits left,\" said Chandra Bhan Prasad, the only Dalit columnist in the Delhi press. </p> <p>\"Bihar is a really backward place, an almost tribal area in these rural places. So it's no surprise.\"</p>",
  "<p>Consumer confidence remained at a record low in August despite the lift given to the nation by Team GB's success at the Olympics and some signs that Britons believe the economy is about to stabilise.</p> <p>The Nationwide building society's consumer confidence index released yesterday stayed flat at 52 in August, compared with 93 in the same month last year. </p> <p>Consumers' views on the economic situation worsened in August with 65% of those questioned believing the situation was bad compared with 61% in July. \"This is not surprising given recent news of rising inflation and unemployment,\" said the report.</p> <p>However, an easing in petrol prices and cuts in mortgage rates helped to prevent optimism sliding further, ending seven consecutive months of falling confidence, according to Nationwide. The number of people thinking the economy will be worse in six months' time eased slightly to 57%, compared with 60% in July, while 28% think it will be the same. </p> <p>Fionnuala Earley, Nationwide's chief economist, said: \"Economic uncertainty continues to affect sentiment around spending and employment, but it seems consumers are beginning to take a realistic view of the future and are factoring in the possibility of tougher times ahead.\"</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said last month that the number of people claiming unemployment benefit in July rose at the fastest rate since 1992 to 864,700.</p> <p>The Nationwide figures follow a consumer confidence index released by Asda this week that showed that consumers felt upbeat about their lives but pessimistic about the economy.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday September 4 2008 </strong></p> <p> The headline of this article is incorrect as it does not reflect the article below, which said that unemployment had been falling for 15 years but rose this year.</p> <p> </p> <p>Britain's jobs market is suffering from the slowdown in the economy as a new report out today shows the number of permanent jobs available has plunged to its lowest level since 2001.</p> <p>Unemployment had been falling for 15 years to its lowest level for three decades, but has risen by about 70,000 this year. Economists say tumbling house prices and stagnant economic growth are likely to push unemployment up sharply over the next year or more.</p> <p>The Recruitment &amp; Employment Confederation's latest survey today says permanent placements contracted for the fifth consecutive month in August while temporary jobs fell for the first time since May 2003.</p> <p>\"The slide in the UK economy continues to hit the jobs market hard - with yet another sharp drop in recruitment,\" said Alan Nolan, director at KPMG, which sponsors the report. \"UK employers are continuing to control payroll costs through redundancies - and by refusing to take advantage of a growing (but increasingly unused) pool of skilled labour.\" </p> <p>He warned that skilled workers are starting to move abroad in search of employment, which could result in a labour shortage when the market picks up again. </p> <p>Thousands of jobs have been shed in the construction sector as the housing and commercial property markets have collapsed. Figures out yesterday showed that Britain's construction sector shrank for a sixth consecutive month in August.</p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply/Market construction index picked up slightly to 40.5 last month from a low of 36.7 in July, but remains in difficulties. A figure below 50 signifies contraction.</p> <p>David Blanchflower, a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, said last week that there was a risk of unemployment rising by 60,000 a month and hitting 2 million by the turn of the year. </p> <p>\"We are going to see much more dramatic drops in output,\" said Blanchflower, who has been a lone voice on the nine-member MPC in calling for lower interest rates in recent months.</p> <p>In an interview with Reuters, he said: \"The fears that I have expressed over the past six months have started to come to fruition. I've obviously voted on quite a number of occasions now for small [quarter-point] cuts but we need to act and we probably need to act in larger amounts than that. We need to get ahead of the game and it appears that we are now behind.\"</p> <p>The Bank begins its two-day meeting today to deliberate on the level of interest rates. Borrowing costs have been unchanged at 5% since April as the MPC remains concerned about rising inflation.</p> <p>But many analysts believe that the Bank must cut rates this week to prevent a recession. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said yesterday that Britain will enter recession this year with contractions of economic output in the third and fourth quarters.</p> <p>The OECD predicted that the British economy will shrink by 0.3% this quarter and by 0.4% in the October to December period as the credit crunch and the housing market downturn worsen. Therefore, this would be two consecutive quarters of negative growth, which is commonly used as the definition of recession. The OECD said Britain would fare worst among the group of seven leading economies.</p> <p>Shadow chancellor George Osborne said: \"Not only is the British economy predicted to shrink in the next two quarters, but it is also the only economy not predicted by the OECD to see a recovery this year. All of our major competitors are predicted to see at least some growth by the end of the year.\"</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, Lord Oakeshott, said: \"Other big economies are forecast to recover but the OECD says Britain is worst placed of all because of falling house prices.</p> <p>\"British families are now paying through the nose for Gordon Brown's complacency, which has allowed house prices and debt to get out of hand.\"</p>",
  "<p>Now the oil price becomes interesting. Hurricane Gustav has shown the strength of the market's downwards momentum. The approach of the storm provoked only a modest climb in prices. Its passing, leaving oil platforms and refineries in the Gulf of Mexico intact, has taken the price below $110 a barrel. That represents a fall of almost 30% since July's peak - a serious move, notwithstanding the recovery in the dollar, the currency in which the black stuff is traded, during the same period. The interesting question is whether Opec, the oil producers' cartel, can defend $100.</p> <p>The rhetoric can be heard. For the second day running, Iran said yesterday that Opec may need to cut output by 1.5m barrels a day, or 5%. The market is over-supplied, it argues, and $100 a barrel is required to provide an incentive to producers to commit to high-cost projects.</p> <p>But does Saudi Arabia agree? It is pumping record volumes and - not before time, in the view of many US politicians - fulfilling its role as the swing producer. The Saudi stance at next week's meeting of Opec is therefore critical. Past comments suggest it, too, is keen to defend $100 a barrel - but that was before the dollar strengthened.</p> <p>For bulls of oil, the fundamental argument remains as strong as ever. Demand from China and India represents a significant shift at a time when physical supply is constrained. But that suddenly looks like tomorrow's story. The short-term picture, to judge by the OECD's economic forecasts, looks very different. The prediction of a recession in Britain captures the headlines here but Germany is also forecast to be at a standstill soon and projections for the US economy are also being cut. If the OECD is right, demand for oil will be hit.</p> <p>The volatility in the oil price over the past few years has undermined the notion of a \"fair value\". What we have learned, however, is that relatively small changes in the supply/demand outlook can produce big price reactions. If Opec can't hold onto $100, it's easy to imagine $80 - a price some oil executives were confidently predicting a few months ago would never been seen again.</p> <h2>Doing for duty</h2> <p>Stamp duty holidays don't work. The measure had no benefit last time it was tried, by the Conservative government in the 1990s, and the chance of it reviving today's moribund market is minimal. The saving on a pound;175,000 home is \u00a31,750. That's an incentive to buy now only if you believe the value of the house won't fall by more. Who believes that? At the current rate of decline, the 1% saving will be eaten up in a month. Far from being an incentive to bring forward a transaction, the stamp duty holiday is more likely to be an incentive to delay a purchase until the end of the tax-free period in a year's time. </p> <p>Something is better than nothing, argue the optimists, but the reality is that the only sure way to stimulate demand for houses is to allow prices to fall to affordable levels - price-to-earnings ratios suggest there is still a long, long way to go. </p> <p>The idea that the housing market is frozen because the banks and building societies won't lend requires a very big qualification. Lenders will lend on reasonable terms to those who can afford a deposit. It's the 90% mortgages that have become expensive, but there's no point complaining about a welcome return of prudent lending standards.</p> <p>We should be more enthusiastic about the government's attempt to contain the number of repossessions. That seems a reasonable social goal. But the idea of offering five-year interest-free deals to first-time buyers, up to 30% of the value of the property, is bizarre. It's an encouragement to buy in a falling market, which is surely not the job of government.</p> <h2>Feeling the breeze</h2> <p>Recruitment firms are worth watching as barometers - they feel economic breezes more quickly than almost any other type of business. So the experience of Hays should serve as a warning of how bad the weather could become. Operating profits in Britain were up 4% in the first half and down 10% in the second. In the space of three months, recruitment for the residential construction sector went from being Hays's strongest sector to its weakest, reports chief executive Alistair Cox.</p> <p>Hays itself is in decent shape. Almost half its fees are generated outside Britain. The strength of its international business gives the group sufficient confidence to lift its dividend by 16%. But it can offer little comfort on the home front - tough and getting tougher is the message.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\">nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The BBC used the Tess of the d'Urbervilles launch to screen a preview tape of this autumn's new dramas, which led into a lengthy introduction from the elegant Kate Harwood, executive producer and controller of series and serials for BBC Drama Production. Could Harwood be in line to fill Jane Tranter's shoes? \"I'm in drama production, not commissioning,\" Kate smiled sweetly. But with eight Emmy nominations for last year's Cranford and two for Sense &amp; Sensibility, BBC drama production has a lot of firepower on its side. And Harwood would represent continuity from the Tranter era in at least one sense: the well-read English/drama graduate's approach to the classics.</p>",
  "<p>So why is it that women get more chances on the political right than it seems they do on the left? Is there something not very progressive about progressives, is the right really gender-blind, or is there something else going on here?</p> <p>Long before <a href=\"http://www.feministsforlife.org/\">Feminist for Life</a> Sarah Palin, with her extraordinary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/02/palin.johnmccain\">personal biography</a>, burst out of Alaska, we had become accustomed to Condoleezza Rice bobbing into every shot over the shoulder of the most right wing US president in living memory. </p> <p>In Germany, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-big-question-how-has-angela-merkel-become-the-key-player-on-europes-political-stage-870814.html \">Angela Merkel</a> singlehandedly revived the Christian Democrats internal and global standing (although journalists still comment on her dress sense). </p> <p>What does the left have to offer? The misjudged courage of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, French presidential candidate of the left (remembered more nowadays for her <a href=\"http://warner.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/segolene-royal/?scp=2&amp;sq=segolene%20royale&amp;st=\" cse\"\"> private life</a> than her political success), or \u2013 well, <a href=\"http://www.harrietharman.org/\">Harriet Harman</a> ran a brilliant campaign last year to become Labour's deputy leader. </p> <p>And though it's more than 20 years since the Democrats first chose <a href=\"http://www.greatwomen.org/women.php?action=viewone&amp;id=61\">Geraldine Ferraro</a> to bring a little humanity to Walter Mondale's presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton's fate in the primaries has been widely interpreted as evidence that even American liberals don't think women can win.</p> <p>Each of the above is a different story. But collectively they raise a thought. The women on the right (who make it) share a common disregard for gender politics. The women on the left (who by and large haven't, or at least not yet) have made feminism an integral part of their public personality. </p> <p>Maybe Palin, who has already delivered for the McCain cause \u2013 er, no joke <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/02/uselections2008.republicans20084\">intended</a> \u2013 by bringing prominence to her anti-contraceptive, anti-abortion (even in cases of rape) pro-gun Conservative populism, proves that women prosper most in the mainstream. So does that mean women damage their chances by making gender a significant part of their political profile?</p> <p>And if they do, is that just more evidence of how enduring popular resistance is to social justice, or do those who are determined to lead change have to think again about how they do it?</p> <p>Some of the most prominent women in New Labour (Patricia Hewitt, for example, or Mo Mowlem) decided, even in opposition, that making gender politics the focus of their efforts damaged their party and themselves.</p> <p>The years of the Blair's babes proved them hideously right. All-women shortlists got women into parliament, but at a high short-term cost. There are now six women in cabinet, but each of them has still had to prove they are there on merit, and not because of some secret scheme of positive discrimination operated by the number ten image consultants. Nobody ever suggested Thatcher became leader of the Tory party because it was a woman's turn.</p> <p>Gender politics do matter. Inequality is an offence against social justice. But context matters too. It is always worth remembering that the minimum wage helped more women, more quickly, than equal pay legislation ever has.</p>"
