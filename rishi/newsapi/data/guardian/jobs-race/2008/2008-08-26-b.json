  "<p>Roy Keane has told his prospective signing Anton Ferdinand that the move to Sunderland will galvanise his career and he can become an England international.</p> <p>The 23-year-old West Ham centre-back is expected to complete the \u00a38m transfer today after yesterday's medical and Keane was happy to give an insight into how he persuaded his ninth signing of the summer to move to the Stadium of Light.</p> <p>\"Maybe Anton needed a new environment to get his career on to a new level,\" said Keane, who will take Sunderland to his former club Nottingham Forest in the Carling Cup tonight. \"He has had a very good club in West Ham, don't get me wrong, but sometimes when a player comes through the ranks and they have been there since they were a young kid, I think sometimes they get to a bit of a crossroads. They think, which road am I going to go on? Am I going to go to another level or just stay where I am?\"</p> <p>The sale of Ferdinand, who rejected a new contract this year, has irritated West Ham's manager, Alan Curbishley - reportedly the deal was agreed at boardroom level without his consent. It may also annoy Sunderland's local rivals, Newcastle United, who were also interested in Ferdinand but were told he was unwilling to move so far north. But Keane believes the deal for the former England Under-21 international is good for all concerned because Ferdinand wanted to avoid going stale and West Ham will receive a decent fee for him.</p> <p>\"There is no reason why he can't go on and become a top, top player. I think he has an international future,\" said Sunderland's manager. \"He has played over 150 games and we're on about players with a bit of experience so, for all his rawness, he has a few games under his belt. He knows the Premiership, he is English, it's a good price, so it suits everyone. It will be up to Anton if he goes up to the next level; he has the ability but, trust me, it is always up to the player how far they go.\"</p> <p>Keane is confident he will make one final signing before the close of the transfer window, with the Portsmouth left-back Hermann Hreidarsson the latest name to be linked with the Black Cats.</p> <p>The impending arrival of Ferdinand has not tempted Keane to allow any of his players to leave on the cheap and there was a rebuke yesterday for the former Sunderland manager Mick McCarthy, now at Wolverhampton Wanderers. They have made their peace since McCarthy, as Ireland's manager, sent Keane home from the 2002 World Cup after a row but Sunderland's manager was unimpressed by his former international team-mate's \u00a31.5m offer for the defender Danny Higginbotham.</p> <p>Keane paid more than double that 12 months ago to sign him from Stoke and said: \"We paid good money for Danny and he has done well for us. He played 20-odd games in the Premier League last season and scored three goals. If someone tells me his value has halved in that time, then he won't be going anywhere.\"</p>",
  "<p>While there was no surprise in Michelle Obama claiming that her husband would make an <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/video/2008/08/26/VI2008082600173.html?hpid=topnews\">\"extraordinary president\"</a>, the way in which she did it was always going to attract scrutiny. </p> <p>The general consensus seems to be that she ticked all the right boxes, lauding American values, emphasising her husband's humble beginnings and that he had benefited from the opportunities which exist in the USA and praising Hillary Clinton.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/790hG6qBPx0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/790hG6qBPx0&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/790hG6qBPx0&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"385\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p><br>Wired.com called the speech \"heartfelt and earthy\", reporting that <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/08/twitterers-gush.html\">her words met with \"almost universal praise\"</a> on the micro-blogging service, Twitter, with even a Republican praising her.</p> <p>Marjorie Valbrun, on <a href=\"http://www.theroot.com/id/47784\">Root</a>, writes that Obama may have appeared tame compared to her public image but she \"stood squarely in her place, with the quiet confidence of someone who believes she has every right to be there\". <br> However, her performance was destined to be overshadowed by news that three men arrested just outside Denver may have been involved in a <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_10300524\">plot to kill Barack Obama</a>. </p> <p>Details remains sketchy at the moment but <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-mitchell/possible-obama-assassinat_b_121298.html\">media reports</a> suggest one of the suspects told police the plan was to shoot the US presidential candidate and that they were linked to white supremacist groups.</p> <p>Michelle Obama had earlier tried to quell the focus on race, telling delegates: \"You see, Barack doesn't care where you're from,<br>or what your background is, or what party, if any, you belong to.\"</p> <p>But from Valbrun's observation that Obama's speech \"represented a conscious shedding of any attributes that could be even remotely suggestive of an 'angry black woman',\" to the details of the \"assassination plot\", last night's events were a reminder that the issue of race is not going to disappear.</p>",
  "<p>For more than a year now, the US political world has expended trillions of person-hours of effort and ploughed billions of words of analysis into assessing whether the United States is ready to elect a black man as president. Countless further words will be written on this same subject before November 4 - and beyond, whether Barack Obama wins or loses. Yet Michelle Obama only had to step up to the speaker's rostrum in Denver to make it clear, before she even opened her mouth, that there is, and was always going to be, a second question in play in this election, nearly but not quite as important as the first: is America ready to elect a black first lady too?</p> <p>This isn't a trivial question. There have been many speeches by African-American politicians at the conventions of both parties down the years - mainly to the Democrats, of course. So the ground has been prepared for the idea that an African-American man would eventually make a presidential nomination acceptance speech one day. But the ground has not been similarly prepared for an African-American woman to take the audition to be the nation's first lady. Given all the mystique, the conservative mystique, that surrounds this role - ask Hillary Clinton, 1992-vintage, if you are in any doubt about that - Michelle Obama is at least as much of a pioneer as her husband.</p> <p>To all but a small audience of political specialists, Michelle Obama is also a total unknown as a person. So she had two tasks to perform in this speech: first to breakdown all the racial stereotypes that still cling to a post like that of first lady and, second, to introduce herself to the electorate in her own right. Any fair judge must surely say that she did the second with fantastic assurance and allure. I also think she cracked it pretty brilliantly with the first question, but it would be na\u00efve not to accept that this will not be easy. </p> <p>The two questions obviously impact on one another. If America is ready for Michelle Obama, and for the portrayal of Barack Obama that she offered in her speech and in the many videos which dotted the agenda of the first evening of the Democratic convention, then some of the cultural and character questions which make this such a unique election may be answered in the Democratic candidate's favour. In this context the most interesting thing we learned this evening about Barack Obama is that when he first asked Michelle for a date years ago she turned him down. The Obama charm, in other words, does not carry everything before it after all. It can be resisted. He's like the rest of us after all. Paradoxically this resistibility helps Obama, because it makes him more human.</p> <p>To many foreigners, the extent to which the American election process focuses on the candidate's partner is somehow suspect, proof perhaps of the whole system's lack of seriousness, in some contexts another snobbish hook on which anti-Americans can hang their coats. Even to many Americans themselves, the idea that the candidate's wife (as it still has been in all significant cases) has to take a public audition along with her husband certainly is peculiar too. It certainly wasn't always thus. Until the 20th century indeed, not even the nominated candidate had to make a speech at the convention, never mind his wife. But the presidential audition is nowadays irredeemably a family affair. The wife, the kids, the brothers and sisters, the parents - they all have a role. One can wish it otherwise - but wishing it different won't make it so.</p> <p>And by these criteria, Michelle Obama did a hugely skilful job. She had to persuade the doubters that she wasn't, as the stereotype has it, another angry black woman. But she did this in a highly principled way, stressing that the struggles of the past were coming to fruition in the Obama candidacy \u2013 the pride was unmissable and rightly so \u2013 but presenting them in the hegemonic rhetoric of the American dream. That's where the current of history meets the new tide of hope, is how she put it, in fluent Obamese, before adding the key line that \"That is why I love this country.\" That brought the house to its feet. At that moment one knew she had done as well as she possibly could have hoped. It was mission accomplished. Job done - for now.</p>"
