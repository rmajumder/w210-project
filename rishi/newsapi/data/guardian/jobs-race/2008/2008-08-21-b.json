  "<p>Fantasy Black Channel is the most thrilling British debut of the year for its spirit of invention, its surfeit of ideas and its ear for a good tune. The Castle Donington four-piece may be young pups but they reference prog, heavy metal, Roxy Music, Blur, Aphex Twin and Gary Numan - often all in the same song. Bathroom Gurgle begins as synth-pop, but after two minutes it suddenly bursts into falsetto spandex rock. Then it shifts genre and tempo again, as versatile singer Samuel Dust yelps: \"Put your hands on your waistline and shift your body to the bassline.\" Every time you play this album, you'll find a new favourite song, riff or wayward moment.</p>",
  "<p>Lord Triesman, the Football Association's independent chairman, has assured Fabio Capello that his position as England coach will not be affected by the imminent departure of the FA's chief executive, Brian Barwick, the man who effectively moved to appoint him towards the end of last year.</p> <p>Confirmation that Barwick would leave Soho Square on December 31 emerged during England's stuttering draw with the Czech Republic on Wednesday. While there had been long-standing tensions between Triesman and his chief executive, the timing of Barwick's departure after less than four years in the role and with Capello yet to take charge of a competitive match did come as a surprise, not least within the FA.</p> <p>With that in mind, Triesman summoned staff at Soho Square yesterday to explain the reasons for the departure, chiefly, \"differences in opinion over what role the chief executive should undertake\" and moved to reassure all that it remains \"business as normal\". While Capello did not attend that meeting because he was out of the country, members of his staff were present and were told that the head coach's position is unaffected.</p> <p>Asked for his reaction after England's friendly, Capello said the chief executive's exit was not an issue upon which he should comment. \"My reaction is that it's not my job,\" he said. \"It's a decision for the board.\"</p> <p>There were suggestions last night that David Gill, Manchester United's chief executive, might be considered as a replacement though it remains to be seen whether Triesman feels there is any need to replace Barwick; it is believed he did not rate Barwick's management skills, so the chief executive's position was always likely to be undermined. Many of the role's tasks can be covered by the recently appointed chief operating officer, Alex Horne.</p> <p>However, leading members of the FA board would like a replacement for Barwick to be appointed and a search to begin swiftly. Last night the former FA chief executive David Davies questioned whether a replacement was needed. Davies said: \"Would you not be better off having a chairman, president, who leads the organisation, who is elected every four years and can be thrown out after four years if the whole of the game does not want that person?\"</p> <p>A prominent figure who could be affected by Barwick's departure is his biggest ally at Soho Square, the director of corporate affairs, Simon Johnson. Johnson was due to play a major role in the FA's bid to host the 2018 World Cup finals but this now seems unlikely. There may also be implications for the head of communications, Adrian Bevington</p> <p>Barwick expressed regret at the manner of his departure yesterday, though he defended his achievements. \"I'm proud to have been in charge,\" he said. \"I'm a huge football person and to have been chief executive of the FA is a special thing. I'm proud to have been able to do the job. The organisation has come on in leaps and bounds which is very important to me.\" With a pay-off of about \u00a3450,000 agreed with the FA, Barwick could leave his position much earlier than planned.<br></p>",
  "<p>John McCain <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/news/elections/1117409,elexpoll082008.article\">is up in the national polls</a>. And, interestingly enough, none of my Democratic friends seem to be worried about that. I think I know why.</p> <p>People sometimes forget that the term \"campaign\" was originally a military term. Thinking of American elections as a kind of non-violent civil war can be a helpful, if crude, metaphor. And in this war we have two very different kinds of armies duking it out, with competing strategies and contingencies and tactics being developed in the lead-up to election day.</p> <p>The McCain campaign is focusing their resources on a combination of air war and guerrilla war, making big advertisement buys in key states to broadcast a steady succession of <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/07/31/mccain_ads_go_negative_early_on_obama/\">increasingly negative political ads</a>, while simultaneously encouraging the electronic version of a whispering campaign by viral emails that paint Barack Obama as everything from a latte-sipping elitist liberal to a radical black activist to the <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/2008/08/19/obama-to-mccain-dont-question-my-patriotism/\">slurs on his patriotism</a> that reference his name and parentage.</p> <p>McCain's is a pretty traditional campaign. Television advertising has gotten more sophisticated and expensive since the 1960 Nixon/Kennedy debates showed the medium's potential for impact on the election. The one new factor, the insidious viral emails, have been effective largely at shoring up McCain's dwindling base and have been able to do so without much cost or accountability. The <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2008/articles/2008/08/16/mccains_fund_raising_machine_rolling_along/\">money is finally rolling in</a>, thanks to the efforts of McCain's fundraisers, and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/05/AR2008080503010.html\">he's using it on TV ads</a>.</p> <p>The McCain campaign's problem is that they are fighting this war with the tools of the last one. There's little innovation at work, and his advisers have dramatically misread the battleground. The days when you could win the hearts and minds of the American public with 30-second television spots is over for good. With the Obama campaign <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iU_P23eyGmxqE8EEa7ba6r86BpIwD92MHQ8G0\">able to match</a> - and even out-spend - McCain dollar for dollar, if the air war was the only battle that mattered, then it might, indeed, be a toss-up.</p> <p>But looking at the electorate in 2004 or even 2000 terms would be a dramatic miscalculation. While the overall demographics of America have shifted as the second world war generation dies off and the number of immigrants grows, the character of the electorate - the registered voters - will be much, much different this time around. This is largely because of Obama's ground war.</p> <p>McCain has budgeted virtually nothing for his own ground war - the volunteers and paid employees who go out on the street and convince people to vote. McCain is depending on the traditional Republican-oriented organisations (evangelicals, gun owners, anti-abortion activists) to do that job, and the fact is that those groups are ambivalent toward McCain at best. There is no great voter-registration initiative within the Republican party this year.</p> <p>Not so for Obama. Seasoned by an interminably long 50-state primary season, the Obama campaign was forced to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/28/AR2008012802558_pf.html\">build an organisation</a>, sometimes from scratch, in every state. The campaign often eschewed the traditional Democratic party apparatus (because of the number of entrenched Hillary Clinton folks within it) and built (or co-opted) their own state organisations. That, combined with the Obama campaign's far-sighted voter-registration drive, has changed the battlefield significantly. Obama didn't put his people in mothballs after winning the nomination, or even focus them on fundraising. He had them pounding the pavement with clipboards, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121850477150231953.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">registering voters</a> everywhere they could. That's why they aren't acting worried.</p> <p>My Republican friends cackled with glee when they saw the poll numbers recently, numbers that showed McCain catching up to Obama in the national polls. If it comes down to a horserace, they reasoned, the incumbent party could probably eek out a last-second victory. I let them have their moment - it was, after all, the first sign of life in the campaign since it began. </p> <p>But they are mistaken, as are McCain's strategists, because the poll numbers targeting \"likely voters\" are flawed. They don't take into account this rapid and significant expansion of the Democratic party, the millions of new voters who will come to the polls in support of the Democrats (many of whom either don't have land-line phones or don't answer polls). Some estimates place the disparity between new voter registrations between Democrats and Republicans at close to 35 to one. That's a significantly larger battlefield than in 2004, and the wedge issues of that election - gay marriage and abortion - just aren't getting the GOP faithful excited.</p> <p>Here in North Carolina, the Obama campaign is a well-established, well-oiled machine by now. Still feeling the swell of support from the primary that put Obama over the top, the local Obama campaigners are issuing daily emails, organising weekly voter-demonstration drives across the state and (more importantly) forging a new kind of politically active Democratic community. </p> <p>These are the foot-soldiers that Obama can count on to take a few days off from work, toil 24 hours a day and drive their databases of new voters to the polls. They have an underdog mentality and constantly expect and prepare for the kind of dirty politics the south is renowned for to erupt at any moment. To my knowledge, McCain's campaign has nothing similar. Hence their emphasis on the air war.</p> <p>Talking face-to-face with Obama's volunteers, it's clear they want to leave nothing to chance. They don't want North Carolina to go red on the basis of a few hundred votes. They want to see it firmly in the Democratic camp, our electoral votes going to Obama. But even if they fail, they tell me, they won't feel it was in vain. Hundreds of state and local Democrats will benefit from the Obama campaign's diligent work, as voters vote the straight Democratic party ticket and bring them into office. And that will ensure that even if the battle for the presidency is lost here (to extend the martial metaphor) the war for control of the direction of the state and the nation will have been soundly won.</p>",
  "<p>Many people today are unaware of how the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_Offences_Act_1967\">Sexual Offences Act 1967</a> \u2013 whose chief architect, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/20/labour1?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=politics\">Leo Abse</a>, died on Tuesday \u2013 was met with much wailing and gnashing of teeth. And not just from homophobes. </p> <p>In the Gay Liberation Front's <a href=\"http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/glf-london.html\">manifesto</a> (1971), the act is mentioned in a section headed \"How we are oppressed\". It states grudgingly: \"The 1967 Sexual Offences Act gave a limited licence to adult gay men \u2026 \" </p> <p>Gay journalists still often flex their radical muscles by listing the act's limitations; I've done it many times myself. </p> <p>Abse's act did not legalise gay sex, it just partly decriminalised it. It enshrined in law a number of inequalities, that would take decades to rectify. The age of consent for gay men was set at 21 when it was 16 for straight people. There were exclusions for the armed forces and merchant seamen. The act didn't cover Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, or the Channel Islands. And there was an incredibly narrow definition of \"private\" sexual acts.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/apr/15/britishidentity.fiction\">Colin MacInnes</a> wrote a waspish satire for Gay News in 1972, where two men chat each other up, but insist on seeing birth certificates, driving licences and national insurance numbers, just to ensure they're not breaking the restrictions on age, employment, or country of residence. Many have pointed out that prosecutions for gay sex actually went up in the years immediately after the act. </p> <p>I interviewed Leo Abse for <a href=\"http://www.gaytimes.co.uk/\">Gay Times</a> last summer, to mark the 40th anniversary of the act. Abse had much else to be proud of in his parliamentary career, he championed many other then unpopular causes; the abolition of capital punishment, divorce, family planning. But I could detect a certain sadness when he talked of the Sexual Offences Act. </p> <p>Not because it led to some sort of Sodom-and-Gomorrah-on-Thames (as some in the Lords had warned) but because of how he was criticised and castigated by gay men as if he was the villain, not the hero, of this piece. </p> <p>But Leo Abse was both brave and bold. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphry_Berkeley\">Humphry Berkeley</a>, the chief backer of decriminalisation among Conservative MPs was booted out at the 1966 election. Abse was a Labour MP but the Labour government distanced itself from him. The prime minister, Harold Wilson, insisted Abse must present his proposals as a private member's bill, not a piece of government legislation. Wilson kept well away anyway, estimating in private it could cost Labour millions of votes. Abse told me he was sent shit through the post on an almost daily basis. </p> <p><a href=\"http://lse.ac.uk/library/archive/projects/grey.htm\">Antony Grey</a>, the key gay campaigner of the 1960s, later conceded that Abse was the only MP who could have possibly got that law through parliament. It very nearly didn't pass \u2013 Labour had a wafer-thin majority. Abse won over many of his fellow Labour MPs by pandering to their prejudices. He even gave me a little parody of the things he'd tell the House: \"Look, you are the wonderful fellows, you are good family men, you have children, marvellous wives \u2013 pity these poor people, they are not like you. They are quite different.'\" </p> <p>Abse said he didn't believe a word of this. He was a Freudian who believed we were all bisexual, and that it was fear of their own homosexuality that drove people to homophobia in the public and in parliament. (It also led him to refer to gay men in the House once as \"faulty males\" \u2013 something he told me he regretted.) </p> <p>At the time, Antony Grey was often exasperated with him and Abse understood why: \"It was difficult for him to accept when I said to him 'you can't do this, you've got to adapt,' because of his conviction. He was a lobbyist and he had to do his job as a lobbyist and I had to do my job as a parliamentarian \u2013 I wasn't propagandising, I was trying to get legislation. He would come into difficulties if he was found to be supporting my compromises, as he saw it \u2013 but I knew that you had to give them carrots in order to be able to get the result you wanted \u2013 and that the thing to do was take it easy, bit by bit.\"</p> <p>When Abse's bill became law in July 1967, Lord Arran emotionally quoted Oscar Wilde: \"My Lords, Mr Wilde was right: the road has been long and the martyrdoms many, monstrous and bloody. Today \u2013 please God! \u2013 sees the end of that road.\"</p> <p>Some 40 years on, Abse's law does not seem so much an act of betrayal, but the only way of initiating a process of change. It was this or nothing. For all its flaws and faults \u2013 and the many cruel injustices that continued long after it was passed \u2013 Leo Abse had finally prised open a door.</p>",

Yes, those and other such prime examples of French-Japanese EuroAnime of the early to mid-80s. In fact, I might go so far as to say the style of the video isn't the only thing in common with the introduction sequences of the cartoons. Musically, they seem to owe somewhat of a debt to them too (though with added backing-shouters) but that's not my department, so I won't.</p> <p>Ooh, look, dog-beast!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336842018\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2008/08/20/inuit.jpg\" alt=\"Pickard of the Pops: 20.08.2008\" width=\"470\" height=\"318\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> But that's all I have to add, really. It's a fabulous tribute to the golden age of creaky toons from the French DIC Entertainment, and animated by a dozen unknown Japanese animating studios.

  "<p>The number of new US workers claiming unemployment benefits fell for the second consecutive week and by more than expected, but still remain at high enough levels to suggest a weakening labour market.</p> <p>Government figures showed that applications for jobless benefits dropped to 432,000, down by 13,000 from the previous week. This takes the level further away from the six-year high seen recently. </p> <p>However, the four-week average climbed to 445,750 - the highest level in almost seven years.
