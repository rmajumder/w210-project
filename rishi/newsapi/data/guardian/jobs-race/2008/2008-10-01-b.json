  "<p>Leon Pryce is as excited as ever to play in the Grand Final on Saturday but has warned the Super League that attention fatigue may be setting in among supporters. For the second season in a row the big match will be contested by St Helens and Leeds, making it Saints' sixth successive major final and sparking fears from their stand-off that the rest of the competition is not coming up to scratch.</p> <p>\"We've been the best two teams for the last two years,\" said Pryce. \"Obviously I want to get there every year, but if I were a fan I wouldn't want to see the same team in the Challenge Cup final for three years. You don't want to be watching the same final year in, year out. We want other teams to be competing and being stronger.\"</p> <p>Saints have won the last three Challenge Cups and played in the Grand Finals of 2006 and 2007, losing the last one to Leeds, and Pryce is concerned that the other teams are failing to narrow the gap on them. \"That is the thing the salary cap is supposed to do. We did get that this year with Catalans, but we need Bradford to get back up there, we need Warrington. They're capable of doing it because they've got the players, and I'm sure they will do it next year.</p> <p>\"It's not our concern, but as a Bradford lad I want to see them back up there competing, because if I'm honest they haven't competed this year at the top level, have they? They haven't competed in big games. Over the years I was there, these were the games that they were playing in - Challenge Cup finals, semi-finals and Grand Finals.</p> <p>\"The competition needs them to get there again, and Wigan to become more dominant and more consistent. It's not my problem, but the competition as a whole needs to become stronger so that the difference from first and second doesn't drop down a lot to third. We need it to become a closer competition. I'm just thinking as a rugby league fan, not as a player.\"</p> <p>Pryce, who will be playing in his eighth Grand Final on Saturday night at Old Trafford, feels that Saints and Leeds have benefited from their strength in depth. \"It's the way Super League is going now - the teams with the most injuries struggle,\" he said. \"The best thing that's happened to us is that when we have had injuries, we've had Kyle Eastmond come in and play well, and Paul Clough the same.</p> <p>\"The young lads coming through and doing their bit is the good thing about Saints - Daniel [Anderson] has given youth a chance, and they've repaid him. You've seen teams like Warrington have six or seven first-grade players out, and you can't compete [like that]. I think they were playing that last game [at Catalans] with barely 13 fit players, and Moz [Adrian Morley] was playing injured. You can't compete these days with three, four, five players out, it's too hard.\"</p> <p>Both teams will today select their 19-man squads from virtually full strength, with Saints expected to include the New Zealand front-rower Jason Cayless despite the fact that he has not played since August 24. Pryce's side will start the game as clear favourites, having beaten Leeds comprehensively two weeks ago, but the memory of last year's 33-6 Grand Final defeat to the Rhinos is fresh enough in their minds to make any feeling of complacency unlikely.</p> <p>\"We were disappointed, and that scoreline was where we were at, at that time of year,\" Pryce said. \"We were tired, we were injured, and they were playing good rugby. They were the better team at that time of year and they deserved their win.</p> <p>\"But this season is a totally different year - we're healthy, confident without being over-confident, and we believe in each other. It's going to be a good game. The biggest message that I can send out is to people getting excited about us beating them 38-10 [in the September 19 semi-final] - it has no relevance on Saturday night.</p> <p>\"It won't be anywhere near that type of game. The first 40 minutes [then] there was nothing between the two teams, and I think it will be that way for 80 minutes this time.\"</p> <h2>Stand-off's seven finals</h2> <p><strong>1999 Bradford 6 St Helens 8 </strong></p> <p>Pryce, 18, loses out to Sean Long goal</p> <p><strong>2001 Bradford 37 Wigan 6 </strong></p> <p>Bulls blitz Wigan in first half</p> <p><strong>2002 Bradford 18 St Helens 19 </strong></p> <p>Long again nemesis with drop-goal</p> <p><strong>2003 Bradford 25 Wigan 12 </strong></p> <p>Pryce enjoys second triumph</p> <p><strong>2005 Bradford 15 Leeds 6 </strong></p> <p>Pryce scores first Old Trafford try</p> <p><strong>2006 Hull 4 St Helens 26 </strong></p> <p>Now a Saint, Pryce scores again</p> <p><strong>2007 Leeds 33 St Helens 6 </strong></p> <p>Pryce's Saints brushed aside</p>",
  "<p>Dismal manufacturing activity, soaring job losses and a record slump in car sales added to pressure on Congress yesterday to reach a deal on the Bush administration's contentious $700bn emergency economic bail-out package.</p> <p>Gloomy economic news sent the Dow Jones industrial average down by more than 200 points at one stage during another volatile day on Wall Street, although the blue-chip index later recovered to close down 19 at 10,831.</p> <p>A key measure of US manufacturing output showed that activity has shrunk to its lowest level for seven years as orders dry up. The Institute of Supply Management said its index fell from 49.9 to 43.5 in September, the sharpest monthly drop since 1984.</p> <p>Motor manufacturers revealed huge drops in sales during September. Ford, Toyota, Nissan and Chrysler each said that activity in showrooms was down by more than 30% as dealers struggle to secure the financing to write car loans. \"Consumers and businesses are in a very fragile place,\" said Ford's marketing chief, John Farley.</p> <p>Bad news fuelled calls for a swift resolution of Congress's two-week battle over the White House's proposed bail-out. \"There's a real sense that something needs to be done,\" said Julia Coronado, a senior US economist at Barclays Capital in New York.</p> <p>A study published yesterday revealed that the struggling US financial services industry has shed 111,201 jobs so far this year. Carmakers are close behind with 94,918 redundancies according to employment consultants Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. The combination of erosion in both employment and manufacturing activity alarmed analysts. On the credit markets, a surge this week in the Libor rate at which banks borrow money from each other is causing particular concern, indicating that the flow of cash is freezing up. \"For the first time it's really starting to look like a recession,\" said Marc Pado, chief US market strategist at broker Cantor Fitzgerald in San Francisco.</p> <p>The price of oil dipped below $100 per barrel in New York to close at $98.53, a fall of $2.11, on evidence that Americans are driving less. Even the flow of money sent home to Mexico by migrant workers in the US is down, falling by 12%, the biggest drop on record.</p> <p>The mood on Wall Street is so sour that a traditional daily ceremony to ring the New York Stock Exchange's opening and closing bell has been disrupted. A Broadway actor, Missi Pyle, who was supposed to do the job this week, dropped out on the grounds that a cheerful celebrity appearance felt inappropriate.</p>",
  "<p>Last year it was My Booky Wook, Maw Broon telling us how to make stovies and a collection of mnemonics. This year it could be Dawn French's autobiography, Dear Fatty, Nigella on basting a turkey or the cartoon adventures of evil penguins. Publishers are racing to come up with a Christmas hit and the starter pistol is fired today: Super Thursday.</p> <p>Nearly 800 titles are being published, three times more than an average day, including cookery books from Nigella Lawson, Jamie Oliver, Gary Rhodes and Rick Stein; memoirs from Dawn French, Julie Walters and Michael Parkinson; and a sporting contest between Jonny Wilkinson, Shane Warne, Bradley Wiggins and Darren Clarke.</p> <p>\"So many of the really big books that are contenders to be in the top 10 are coming out. I can't remember there being one day or even one week when it's been like this. We've known about this day for a while so we're prepared,\" said Michael Jones, books category manager at Borders, who coined the Super Thursday phrase.</p> <p>Kate Gunning, product manager at Foyles, agreed that today is a big publishing day. \"It does feel like the kick-off. Thursday is the traditional publishing day anyway and of course a high proportion come out in the latter part of the year, but I've not known it be quite as concentrated as this.\"</p> <p>Gunning said it was noticeable how many of the best prospects were coming out on the same day. \"It's quite fun in a way, it does concentrate the mind. There has been a real surge in deliveries and quite a lot of extra work.\"</p> <p>Booksellers have been among the more optimistic retail voices as the credit crunch bites. Books traditionally continue to sell well during tricky times, with parents, for example, deciding against the expensive computer game and going for the cheaper option. </p> <p>Benedicte Page, of the industry magazine The Bookseller, said: \"Books do tend to perform well during difficult financial times; they're very good value as a present and I think sellers are quite optimistic that in spite of everything that's going on, they will do well. </p> <p>\"It also seems to be a strong year. There's a new Jamie Oliver, there's a new Nigella Lawson. The celebrity books are strong and the publishers have realised that for a celebrity memoir to do well they have to be genuinely well-liked; there has to be a warmth factor.</p> <p>\"It is a slightly anxious time for publishers but there is a lot of excitement and a lot of optimism and they're waiting to see if the big titles do as well as they expect.\"</p> <p>So what will do well this year? \"I'm so bad at predicting,\" said Gunning. \"I'm the opposite of the Oracle. It's always quite fun when a book that cost tuppence ha'penny makes half a million.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Waterstone's said it was noticeable that there were fewer reality show tie-ins. \"But there is still a massive interest in good celebrity stories, and it's wrong to dismiss books like those this year from Michael Parkinson, Jonathan Ross, Paul O'Grady et al as just 'celebrity' books. These are books by people who have gained millions of fans over decades, and do have fascinating stories to tell - there will always be a market for that sort of book.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The thing about unexpected hits is they're very hard to predict. What will do well this year? I fancy How to Avoid Huge Ships - the history of the Diagram prize which celebrates books with wonderfully odd titles.\"</p> <p>Also being tipped to sell well are David Starkey's book on the early life of Henry VIII, Elia Anie's cartoon book Evil Penguins, Andy McNab's return to non-fiction, Seven Troop, and The Mighty Boosh book. </p> <p>But it's never an exact science and there are few who could have predicted that a book on punctuation, Lynn Truss's Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves, would have been the incredible success it was. Russell Brand's My Booky Wook was Christmas number one last year (Maw Broon's Cookbook also did well) and Peter Kay was top the year before. This year both Frank Skinner and Jonathan Ross are predicted to do well with their books.</p> <p>According to Gunning: \"My Booky Wook was not necessarily predicted to be last year's number one. For the publishers it's a bit like spread betting. A heck of a lot of money is spent on these books and not all of them are going to hit the jackpot, they can't all be in the top 10.\"</p> <h2>Tipped for success</h2> <p><strong>National treasures </strong></p> <p>Dawn French, Dear Fatty: her father's suicide, adopting a child, Jennifer Saunders and Lenny Henry are all written about in the form of letters to those who have touched French over the years.</p> <p>Julie Walters, That's Another Story: the actor's autobiography, including tyrannical convent nuns, night terrors, an LSD trip, romancing Pete Postlethwaite and the menopause.</p> <p>Michael Parkinson, Parky: the chat show king on his life and why there'll never be another one like him.</p> <p><strong>Food fight</strong></p> <p>Jamie Oliver, Jamie's Ministry of Food: cheeky chappie or overexposed irritant ... the nation decides.</p> <p>Nigella Lawson, Christmas: how to entertain fabulously, with a Swedish variation included.</p> <p><strong>Sporting heroes</strong></p> <p>Bradley Wiggins, In Pursuit of Glory: need to know how you can go from drinking a dozen pints in the pub to being a cycling superstar?</p> <p>Shane Warne, Shane Warne's Century: the best 100 cricket players he's played against or with.</p> <p>Jonny Wilkinson, Tackling Life: quantum physics, Buddhism and rugby.</p>",
  "<p>Walking up to the security zone on my first day at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\">conference</a> it was dark, and I have to confess my badge was not clearly visible. As I approached, a very helpful member of staff thought they would save my legs and shouted, \"You've got to be a Tory to get in there.\" I fished out my badge to prove I was.</p> <p>That I was a black guy admitting to being a Tory totally confused the poor man. I am used to this kind of reaction and many a time I find myself having to ferociously defend why it is possible to be black and a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives\">Conservative</a>.</p> <p>The left have for the past 50 years purported to be the voice of \"Black Britain\". Their views have been swallowed hook, line and sinker by the white liberal classes and out of that was born the stereotype of how and what a black person should be. The black political classes, usually those who earn their living in the race industry, have the ear of the white liberals and together they have colluded in defining \"Black Britain\".</p> <p>There are a growing number of black people who, like me, understand that our only way forward is not to accept the role of victim. We don't want to be intellectual sport any longer. We realise that change is going to come only if we go out and make it happen ourselves.</p> <p>In the past some black people felt that the only way they could get on was to copy the behaviour and mannerisms of their white hosts. The right pinned their hopes on these caricatures. Meanwhile the left, with their need to feel guilty for the past ills done to black people, exalted those who told them how bad they were and how they need to be trained to manage black people.</p> <p>Black Tories have in the past kept their mouths shut and stayed hidden away, for fear of being ridiculed by the black community and mocked by white liberals. But in the last few years we have seen black people start to come out of the shadows and put their heads above the parapet.</p> <p>At the moment we are a curiosity, but this curiosity offers us the opportunity to explain that being black in Britain does not mean feeling like a victim or being owed. As I walk through conference I see that there are still only a few black faces, but that number is growing each year. We are becoming more confident and after years existing in the shadows it is now our time to have our say.</p> <p>We don't need permission to join the Conservative party. This party is as much mine as my white colleagues'. We understand that the way forward is not by feeling owed. With hard work and by taking personal responsibility we can be whatever we want to be. The challenge is for everyone else to recalibrate their template of what it means to be black in Britain.</p>",
  "<p>His rival James Bond has always proven ripe ground for parody, but Jason Bourne has managed to avoid being the target of big screen satirists - until now. </p> <p>In a clear nod to the films based on Robert Ludlum's books, Jack Black has signed on to play an American who finds himself washed up on a beach in Cuba with nothing but an inkling that he used to be a superspy to help him work out who he is. Of course this being a comedy, it turns out that the character has a rather less exciting background than he imagines.</p> <p>The untitled project will be scripted by Black's Kung Fu Panda writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger, according to the <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i4133c8366c5e9b3623175ee409dc34f3\">Hollywood Reporter</a>. Black is producing and the feature has been picked up by Universal in a seven-figure deal.</p> <p>\"For our next live-action project, we knew we wanted to work with either a panda or Jack,\" Aibel said. \"We also figured that if we could write for Jack as a panda, we could write for him as a human.\"</p> <p>Kung Fu Panda was one of the biggest hits of the summer, taking $405m around the globe. Its writers, who graduated from the King of the Hill TV show, are currently working on the animated movie, Monsters vs Aliens, featuring the voices of Seth Rogen and Reese Witherspoon, which will hit cinemas in the spring. Black will next appear in the prehistoric comedy Year One, which is being directed by Harold Ramis and also stars Superbad's Michael Cera.</p>"
