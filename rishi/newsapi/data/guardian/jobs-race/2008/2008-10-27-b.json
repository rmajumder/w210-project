  "<p>Law enforcement officers have foiled a plot by two neo-Nazis who aimed to assassinate Barack Obama and kill 102 other black people, according to court records unsealed today.</p> <p>The disrupted plot involved robbing a gun store to obtain weapons that the two skinheads would use against Obama and black students in the state of Tennessee, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), a US law enforcement agency.</p> <p>ATF agents confiscated five guns from the two perpetrators, 20-year-old Daniel Cowart of Bells, Tennessee, and 18-year-old Paul Schlesselman of West Helena, Arkansas. Both are being held without bail by authorities.</p> <p>\"They said that would be their last, final act, that they would attempt to kill Senator Obama,\" Jim Cavanaugh, the special agent in charge of the ATF's Nashville office, told the Associated Press. </p> <p>\"They didn't believe they would be able to do it, but that they would get killed trying.\"</p> <p>Although the perpetrators were doubtful of their ability to carry out their grisly plans, the plot risks stoking the simmering cauldron of racial uncertainty that Obama has faced in rural areas of the US. </p> <p>Even as polls show his support among white voters reaching a record high for a Democratic candidate, workers for the Obama campaign have confronted the legacy of prejudice in the south and Appalachian areas.</p> <p>Obama campaign offices in several states have been defaced with racist graffiti, and door-to-door canvassers have shared reports of voters making prejudiced remarks about the candidate. </p> <p>Three men were detained two months ago during the Democratic convention in Denver after discussing a plot to kill Obama, but prosecutors did not deem that incident a credible threat.</p> <p>The two neo-Nazis chose 102 as the number of victims for their plot based on numerology that is significant to white supremacists. They are facing charges of unregistered firearm possession, conspiracy to steal firearms from a licensed gun dealer, and making threats to a candidate for president.</p>",
  "<p>The Israeli foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, was slightly ahead today in the race to be Israel's next prime minister according to opinion polls that forecast a tight race in general elections that could be held within three months.</p> <p>Livni, as the new head of the ruling Kadima party, announced yesterday that her efforts to put together a coalition government had failed, meaning early elections will be called. She is pushing to have them held as soon as possible - the earliest date would be January 27, a year and 10 months ahead of schedule.</p> <p>In recent months most polls have suggested Binyamin Netanyahu, head of the opposition rightwing Likud party, as the likely winner. But polls in both the Ma'ariv and Yedioth Ahronoth newspapers today put him slightly behind Livni.</p> <p>Ma'ariv projected Livni's centrist Kadima party would win 31 seats in the 120-seat Knesset against 29 seats for Likud. Yedioth's poll put Kadima on 29 seats against 26 for Likud. </p> <p>While both polls forecast a tight contest, they showed a sharp drop in support for Ehud Barak's Labour party, which has been Kadima's largest partner in the government for the past two and a half years. Labour had 11 seats, according to both polls.</p> <p>In the current parliament Kadima has 29 seats, Labour 19 and Likud 12.</p> <p>Netanyahu made a quick start to his campaign today with a sharply rightwing speech for the opening session of the Knesset. He said if elected he would ensure Israel kept the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in 1967, as well as large parts of the West Bank and the whole of Jerusalem. Palestinians are trying to claim the West Bank and east Jerusalem, as well as Gaza, as theirs for a future independent state.</p> <p>His comments set up a contest between himself and the more centrist ex-Likud member Livni over how to conduct peace negotiations. Livni favours continuing talks with Syria and the Palestinians.</p> <p>Livni has faced some criticism in recent days for failing to achieve a coalition government without elections, but the polls suggest her refusal to give in to the demands of smaller parties that were potential allies may have done her some good. </p> <p>\"She apparently truly believes that there are prices that cannot be paid, that there are red lines that must not be crossed, even for the sake of coming to power,\" wrote Nadav Eyal in Ma'ariv. </p> <p>\"To some this may sound amateurish, almost surreal. For most of us it is a refreshing change.\"</p>",

  "<p>Marie O'Riordan had an epiphany during a recent meeting when it dawned on the editor of Marie Claire that the magazine was destined for a potential relaunch. Having overseen four of them in seven years as editor she realised she \"couldn't face\" another. There and then she decided to step down from the title to go freelance. The announcement shocked the magazine industry 11 days ago. Why would she do so voluntarily at a time of economic turmoil? Just how bad is the state of the UK magazine sector if an editor who had maintained her title as the No 3 fashion glossy in sales was heading so unexpectedly for the exit?</p> <p>O'Riordan insists that the decision, which was her own, was made for purely personal reasons. A revamp would have been \"exhausting\". \"You have to feel quite strident to go into a research process like this as you know they are going to pull it apart,\" she says. But once her mind was made up, it was greeted amicably by her bosses at IPC, who she maintains \"have been fantastic\".</p> <p>\"My bosses here agreed that you can't lead a team into research if you already feel like you have done it once too often,\" she says, adding that she had also just celebrated the magazine's 20th anniversary and felt compelled to consider the next 20 years of her own life. </p> <p>The ebullient Irishwoman also wants to spend more time at home and points to the enormous impact of the recent death of both her parents within a year of each other. This was the right time to leave, she says, both for her and for the magazine. \"I have seen some editors stay in a job into their 50s and they look vulnerable when they are looking for something new, I think,\" says the editor who, at 49, says she is \"the right side of 50\". \"I have been feeling safe for quite a while and I really want a change.\" </p> <p>O'Riordan, who leaves at the end of the year, also remains upbeat about the future of Marie Claire, and other established glossy titles such as Elle, Cosmopolitan and Vogue, which she believes share a \"brand heritage\". Other magazines, without this history and instant recognisability, are more vulnerable, she says. She cites Haymarket women's glossy Eve which got the chop last month because of \"unsustainable\" losses. According to O'Riordan, this was because the magazine \"didn't have anything unique to offer\".</p> <p>Marie Claire, she says, has a very clearly defined USP. There is the Fashion With Heart tagline and an attempt to appeal to women \"who care about subjects beyond their own postcode\". O'Riordan feels this seriousness has helped sales. Pure showbiz magazines, she argues, face the toughest future. \"The magazines that are going to suffer the most are the trashy ones, the ones that do weekly gossip. All the papers do gossip, even the broadsheets do gossip, and they can't go on exponentially, especially now that they are competing with gossip websites.\" </p> <p>This view is borne out by the latest half-year ABC circulation figures which showed downturns for women's celebrity and gossip magazines. Bauer's Heat was down 15.8% year on year to 470,129 while NatMags' celebrity-focused weekly Reveal was down 20.2% to 277,002.</p> <p>Things have not been rosy for Marie Claire either, however. Sales fell to 316,765, down 4.8% year on year - O'Riordan's poorest six months in charge. The magazine has faced increased competition since she became editor in 2001, the same year Glamour was launched and went straight to No 2 behind Cosmopolitan on launch, bumping Marie Claire into third place. </p> <p>Advertising will be under even more pressure than circulation next year, says O'Riordan. \"As a result I think smaller brands will struggle because they rely on advertising more.\" There is a well-worn notion that high-end mags do well in times of economic difficulty - does she agree? \"They are a treat substitute - something you spend \u00a33.50 and can read in the bath. You can stay at home and fantasise about fashion or whatever.\" </p> <p>There are lots of things she will miss about editing the magazine - and lots she won't. She will not be sad to see the back of the \"bubble of physical perfection\" during the major ready to wear and couture fashion shows, and, of course, all those jokes about the magazine being named after her. And then there are also the long hours, interminable lipstick launches and \"boring lunches with people who are not very interesting but you have to do business with\". </p> <p>She has plans to work in other media, has been meeting newspaper editors and TV and literary agents (she enjoyed her time as a judge on BBC3's Britain's Missing Top Model) and has an idea for a novel, perhaps charting her own career, from an early life as a part-time librarian in the National College of Art and Design in Dublin to the front row of the shows. </p> <p>The sales decline was not a factor in her decision to quit, O'Riordan says. But one rival magazine executive, who asked not to be named, says that her departure - and the arrival of her successor - might mean that Marie Claire could go downmarket.</p> <p>\"One editor leaving for personal reasons probably won't have a lasting impact on the whole sector, popular and well-known as Marie was,\" adds the executive. \"But the thing to notice is the reason for her leaving - how exhausting this constant pressure to stay fresh in a constantly changing media environment actually is. This is not likely to get any better any time soon.\"</p> <p><strong>How to survive lipstick launches and boring lunches</strong><br>Fashion meetings: what precarious, often incomprehensible affairs they are, involving the kind of tact and tricky undercurrents that would try the sensitivity of a Middle East peace negotiator. Oh sure, those two ladies in the booth at the Wolseley might sound as if they're just discussing what they did on their last holiday, but there is actually a whole world of unspoken mutual hatred and fear going on. </p> <p>Fashion magazine editors often have to meet - or \"touch base\" with, to use the grating parlance - representatives from the labels who advertise in the magazine for reasons that are never wholly clear. Yes, the advertisers would like more product placement in the magazine; yes, the editor would like the brand to give the publication more money. But even if neither of these dreams comes true, as long as the advertiser continues to fork out at least some money then it'll have some presence in the magazine and everyone's (sorta) happy. </p> <p>Really, these meetings just serve as a reminder to the editor about who pulls the financial strings, while both parties pretend that this somewhat embarrassing financial blackmail element in their relationship does not exist. (\"Relationship\" is another popular term as in \"FancyPantsLabel has always had an excellent relationship with Pretty magazine\", which translates as \"We at FancyPantsLabel have always bought the back cover space of Pretty magazine, so why the hell haven't you featured our new handbag in the magazine yet?\") Yet equally, much to the advertiser's gnashing frustration, it is the magazine that has the power to attract customers and give the label credibility with readers. </p> <p>So there the two of them are, locked in mutual resentment, making wilting small talk. Occasionally the advertiser will mention a \"really exciting new handbag shape\" the label is launching but, really, neither of them can be bothered. Similarly, they can't talk about other people in the industry because everything gets back to everyone and, with the merry-go-round nature of magazines and newspapers, you're bound to end up working tomorrow for the person you were bitching up last week. You could talk about your outfit but, of course, that risks insulting the advertiser if you're not wearing any of its clothes. The shows, of course, are always an option, although saying \"I loved everything\" will barely get you through the first course. So, um, what did you do on your holiday this year?<br><strong>Hadley Freeman</strong></p>",
  "<p>The organisers of an extreme marathon that left hundreds of fell runners stranded overnight in the Lake District in appalling weather conditions were criticised yesterday by mountain rescuers and a senior police officer for allowing the event to go ahead despite warnings of 100mph winds and torrential rain.</p> <p>Fell runners had to wade through waist-height water at times, while others spoke of having to crawl or being forced to lie on the ground due to the force of the wind and driving rain. </p> <p>The two-day Original Mountain Marathon, which attracted 2,500 competitors, began at 9am on Saturday near Keswick. It was called off three hours later, but, because mobile phones were banned, it was almost impossible to inform the many hundreds of runners who were already struggling with the adverse conditions. Several hundred entrants dropped out before the start because of the weather.</p> <p>Mark Hodgson, head of Keswick mountain rescue team said: \"The extreme weather was forecast on Thursday and it should have been cancelled in the morning ... I know these runners were supposed to be experienced and equipped but we had 70 mountain rescuers dealing with 11 casualties in absolutely horrendous conditions. I looked from 1,500ft above Seathwaite and it was like a battleground.\"</p> <p>Superintendent Gary Slater, of Cumbria police, said they and mountain rescue teams had brought concerns to the attention of the organisers. \"Common sense has got to dictate what we do in these circumstances and as I've said it's disappointing that the race did go ahead, despite concerns we and others had raised.\"</p> <p>Tony Johnson, 32, a runner from Lincoln, said: \"I don't think it should have ever gone ahead - the weather conditions were too bad.\" The runners \"went along with it because we thought the organisers must know what they are doing\".</p> <p>Tony Gates, 43, from Stevenage, said \"the wind was so intense and prolonged that it caught everyone out\". Conditions on top of Dale Head were terrifying. \"We were totally disorientated and couldn't see anything because we were in cloud.\" He said they were cold, tired, worried and done in.</p> <p>A 52-year-old man from Nottingham slipped and broke his leg, according to Cockermouth mountain rescue team. A race marshal was also taken to hospital with hypothermia. Four mountain rescue teams were involved in the searches.</p> <p>Another runner, Neil Talbott, 27, an RAF trainee fighter pilot, said: \"I have never experienced conditions like that before. The rain was incessant but the wind proved just as difficult and I was on all fours at one point just to get through it.\"</p> <p>Mark Weir, manager of the Honister slate mine, where many runners sheltered on Saturday night, was highly critical of the organisers. He and his staff worked through the night ferrying runners and volunteers down the 1,100ft (330m) pass. </p> <p>Weir later added: \"We have come within inches of turning the Lake District mountains into a morgue. We need to learn from it. In extreme freak weather like this, it is hell.\"</p> <p>The slate mine had seen 1ft (30cm) of rain fall since Thursday, according to the Environment Agency.</p> <p>A helicopter from RAF Valley in Anglesey was brought in to assist mountain rescue teams and search for those still missing yesterday. By mid-afternoon, everyone had been accounted for.</p> <p>Eight severe weather warnings had been issued by the Environment Agency on Saturday in Cumbria. Parts of Keswick had 65mm of rain in 24 hours up to yesterday morning - average monthly rainfall in the north-west in October is 80mm.</p> <p>Injured runners were taken to a cottage hospital in Keswick suffering from hypothermia and minor injuries. </p> <p>A total of 743 people sought shelter overnight at the Lakeland Sheep and Wool Centre in Cockermouth, as well as at the slate mine, a nearby outdoor activity centre and a school.</p> <p>The weather at the weekend was the worst in the event's 40-year history. According to the race website, the end of October is chosen \"to allow weather to enhance the challenge\".</p> <p>The organisers defended the decision to stage the event. An article on their website said: \"The whole situation will no doubt be analysed in every detail long after the event, but at the root of the media frenzy (and much of the criticism the race is getting) is a misunderstanding of what a mountain marathon is all about.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday October 28 2008. We incorrectly described Neil Talbott as an RAF fighter pilot. He is a trainee fighter pilot. This has been corrected.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday October 28 2008.

  "<p>As the sun rose over Soweto on South Africa's first democratic election in 1994, the Mwale family were too busy with practical matters to ponder the historical resonance of the day.</p> <p>Following rumours that a white supremacist group was going to poison the main water tank, they boiled the water and cooked a huge pot of mealies. The day before, during early voting, granny had waited seven hours to cast her ballot for Nelson Mandela and the kids had to bring her food. Now it would be granny's turn to come to the rescue.</p> <p>I recall walking with the mother of the house, Esther Mwale, in silence at 7am through zone 9 of Meadowlands, the morning fog slowly lifting to reveal that people had ironed their best trousers and put on their sturdiest shoes for the day. All dressed up for democracy.</p> <p>The two hours Esther spent queueing to vote somehow served as a dignified, humane response to the horrors of apartheid. After his wife, Ruth First, was killed by the regime, African National Congress militant Joe Slovo said: \"The most effective punishment is to force those who did it to live in a democratic South Africa.\" And here it was.</p> <p>But if long lines of black people at polling stations showed the promise of a fledgling democracy in South Africa, the prospect of similar scenes next week will illustrate a failing democracy in the US. A longstanding, systematic, legal and political campaign to suppress the vote in Democratic areas combined with the shambolic, shameful neglect of the electoral infrastructure could yet cause chaos on an unprecedented scale. </p> <p>In short, come next Tuesday, the issue may not so much be who votes for whom, but who gets to vote and whose votes get counted. A recent CNN poll showed that 42% of voters are not confident their vote will be accurately cast and counted - almost three times the figure four years ago. With the record numbers of newly registered voters will be a record number of lawyers on both sides. If it's close, the courts may once again pick the winner.</p> <p>The popular response to such an unpopular outcome is not difficult to imagine. According to the Washington magazine The Hill, police across the country are preparing for unrest. Swat teams will be on standby in Oakland, California. The Democratic secretary of state in Ohio now has protection from death threats after she refused to make a list of 200,000 newly registered voters available to Republicans.</p> <p>Some of this mayhem stems from a noxious blend of officiousness and incompetence. In Jackson County, West Virginia, people have been hitting the touch-screen for Barack Obama and finding they have voted for John McCain. In Florida they are testdriving the third ballot system in three election cycles. Election workers are struggling. Those who thought they would vote early and avoid the queues are waiting in line for three hours. </p> <p>Added to the technological flaws with machines and lack of technical training for those operating them are technocratic electoral laws that aren't fair, don't work and in any case aren't being heeded. According to the New York Times, tens of thousands of eligible voters in six battleground states have been illegally removed from voter rolls or will be prevented from voting in ways that violate federal law. In Wisconsin, one in five voters' names on the registration database did not completely match names on other state records, including four of the six former judges charged with overseeing the elections. Both presidential candidates may have been wasting their time wooing Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher - aka Joe the plumber - at the last debate. He is registered as Worzelbacher, and therefore may find himself ineligible to vote. </p> <p>While this is happening everywhere (Jackson county is 98% white and voted for Bush in the last two elections), it is compounded by a protracted Republican effort to disenfranchise Democratic voters under the guise of combating voter fraud. Voter fraud is a serious issue. The trouble is it barely exists. In the six years since the Bush administration has made it a priority, barely 100 people have been convicted and fewer than 200 have been charged. The overwhelming majority were either people who thought they were eligible but weren't (immigrants, felons etc) or those registering fictitious people. </p> <p>\"If they found a single case of a conspiracy to affect the outcome of a Congressional election or a statewide election, that would be significant,\" Richard Hasen, election law expert at the Loyola Law School, told the New York Times last year. \"But what we see is isolated, small-scale activities that often have not shown any kind of criminal intent.\"</p> <p>But that hasn't stopped Republicans trying. Five of the 12 US attorneys who were fired last year, in the scandal that led to the resignation of US attorney general Alberto Gonzales, were axed because they refused to pursue the issue of voter fraud with sufficient vigour. It also explains the Republican attacks on the community group Acorn, which pays people to register voters in low income and minority areas. Some of Acorn's workers made up names. That should be and has been condemned. But there is no evidence that it has resulted in a single fraudulent vote ever being cast since Acorn began its large-scale voter registration drives four years ago. </p> <p>While attempts at voter suppression are partisan in intent they are racial in effect. The Democrats have not won an election without the black vote since 1964. The most effective and crude way to undermine their base is to minimise the vote in black areas. This is precisely what happened in Florida in 2000, where Republicans lowered the threshold for inclusion on the \"purge list\" of ineligible voters. By the time they were done, African-Americans accounted for 88% of those purged, even though they only comprised 11% of the actual electorate. </p> <p>The practical consequences of this interference, manipulation and, at times, intimidation is twofold. It disenfranchises people who either don't have the time, inclination or wherewithal to stand up to officialdom. And it creates huge lines while others stay and fight. A Democratic party survey from 2004 found half of the state's African-American voters in Ohio reported some problems at the polls on election day. On average, black voters waited in longer lines than whites, were more likely to be asked for identification when they got there and felt more intimidated. </p> <p>This year will be worse. Obama's strategy has hinged on registering huge numbers of new voters. Overrepresented among them are the black, the young and first-time voters. For at least six months this eventuality has been predictable. And yet electoral officers around the country have declared themselves entirely unprepared. Just as in South Africa 14 years ago, the huge turnout we are seeing in early voting, and which will undoubtedly come on election day, marks a celebration of a historic moment in the nation's democracy. But the long lines and their demographic composition will mark not dignity but disorganisation and discrimination.</p> <p>It remains one of the paradoxes of this election that black America may yet get a president before black Americans have fully secured their right to vote.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday October 27 2008.

  "<p>Hillary Clinton is long gone from the presidential race, but the women of US TV news are still leaving an indelible mark on the campaign scene this year. </p> <p>From MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, whose new programme has doubled its primetime ratings in one month, to CBS's Katie Couric, who has buried her critics with tough interviews of Sarah Palin, female presenters are increasingly prominent.</p> <p>\"People love these women,\" Marie Wilson, a women's rights advocate, says. \"The popularity of and trust in these women, who have been on everything from Meet the Press [on NBC] to Fox News, has really increased the normalcy of women experts on TV.\"</p> <p>Wilson, who founded the White House Project, which aims to advance women in leadership, points to a singular driving force behind the female ascendance in US political news: Clinton. \"It wasn't until you got a serious woman contesting for president that you got a serious decision to put women on the air.\"</p> <p>Campbell Brown, who jumped from NBC to host her own CNN show in March, became a YouTube sensation when she refused to let a young Republican spokesman dismiss questions on Palin's foreign policy experience. The segment was so pointed that John McCain cancelled a future CNN appearance in retaliation, but Brown's network stood by her.</p> <p>Some female presenters are pitted against not only McCain and Barack Obama but their male counterparts as well. When the Republican nominee accused MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski of pro-Obama bias during a live interview, her co-host Joe Scarborough promptly sided with McCain. But Brzezinski would not back down. </p> <p>\"As a characterised Obama supporter, which I take objection to,\" she told McCain, \"I'll just say, take care of my brother working on your campaign.\"</p> <p>The high visibility of these strong female presenters is a welcome development for women's rights campaigners. Yet many warn that US political news is a long way from parity between the sexes. \"There's a double-edged sword here because we've seen so much problematic coverage,\" says Jennifer Pozner, director of the advocacy group Women in Media &amp; News. \"More coverage is not always better. We need to look at the content as well as the people providing the content.\"</p> <p>Much of that problematic coverage centred on Clinton, who was caricatured by some TV presenters as an emasculating woman with a campaign made possible by her successful husband. After the former first lady ended her presidential run in June, Couric offered a postmortem to CBS news viewers. \"One of the great lessons of [Clinton's campaign] is the continued and accepted role of sexism in American life, particularly in the media,\" she said.</p> <p>The next great test of women's rise in the US media may come after the election, when NBC will crown the new host of America's most popular Sunday politics programme, Meet the Press. The current frontrunners for the job are all white males - a fact that alarmed the Washington-based communications consultant Margot Friedman into starting a campaign of her own.</p> <p>Friedman has launched the website dontletnbcdiswomen.org to marshal support for a female presenter for the role. She has not endorsed a particular newswoman for the job, but her site suggests Brown, Gwen Ifill of PBS and Andrea Mitchell of NBC. If Obama becomes the first black president next week, Friedman says, \"it's going to be a whole new ball game in the US. And yet, if you turn on the TV on Sunday morning, it looks like 1980. It's funny that mainstream media is not keeping pace with what's happening in politics.\"</p>"
