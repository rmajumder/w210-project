  "<p>Britain's largest staffing firm warned today that the UK labour market is set to suffer a sharp slowdown, with hefty job cuts throughout the City, and in property and construction.</p> <p>Hays's forecast echoed that of Bank of England monetary policy committee member, David Blanchflower, who last month said there would be a grim run up to Christmas this year with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/11/recession.unemploymentdata\">tens of thousands of people facing unemployment</a> as the UK economy slides into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">recession</a>.</p> <p>The company said that fees in the UK and Ireland, where it generates around half of its income, fell 8% in the last three months due to sluggish hiring in the City - reflecting the impact of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a> and collapsing financial sector.</p> <p>Permanent job placements are also being squeezed, with fees earned from these rising by just 1%. Instead the group said more temporary work is being generated, with like-for-like net fees in this area up 8%.</p> <p>\"The UK is being impacted by wider economic issues affecting corporate and candidate confidence. The most affected areas are City related activities and the construction and property sectors where we've seen a significant reduction in demand,\" chief executive, Alistair Cox said in a conference call today, adding there \"no doubt that markets are getting tougher\".</p> <p>Like-for-like net fees grew at 4% in the three months to the end of September, the group said.</p> <p>Hays, which employs about 9,000 staff worldwide, said it had trimmed its workforce by 5% over the quarter to cut costs, following a 7% reduction earlier in the year.</p> <p>Earlier this week, rival recruiter Michael Page announced a leap in third quarter profit of 14.6%, while UK staffing firm Robert Walters today said third quarter net fees had grown by 6%. However, both companies warned that UK and US job markets were slowing.</p> <p>In a yet another sign of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/02/creditcrunch.china\">east's strength</a> during the global downturn, the group said its international business, particularly in Asia Pacific, continued to grow solidly. Continental Europe also held up well.</p> <p>FinnCap analyst Duncan Hall said despite Hays global reach, domestic sentiment would have a \"significant bearing on prospects\".</p> <p>\"There are good opportunities in places such as Germany and the United Arab Emirates and where we see good trends we'll continue to invest with caution,\" said Cox. He said he would continue to focus on keeping costs low and reacting to the economic conditions too keep business afloat.</p> <p>Shares in Hays, which have shed 30% since the turn of the year, were nearly 6% higher at 78.25 pence by mid-morning.</p>"
