  "<p><strong>Alan Clarke</strong> at <strong>BNP Paribas</strong> said the <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/business/2008/aug/13/unemploymentdata.economics\">poor labour market figures</a> would support the case for an interest rate cut from the dovish-members of the monetary policy committee.</p> <p>\"We expect the unemployment rate to rise by around 1 to 1.5 percentage points over the coming year with risks that it is even worse. The good news is that reports such as this limit the risk of an interest rate hike and brings forward the likely timing of the first interest rate cut.\"</p> <p>\"The latest UK labour market figures show that the rise in unemployment is rapidly picking up pace ... Employment is still rising - but only just,\" <strong>Vicky Redwood</strong> at <strong>Capital Economics</strong> said, adding that at least the inflationary pressures in the labour market remain benign.</p> <p><strong>David Page</strong> at <strong>Investec</strong> said that the figure showed there was no risk of second round inflation effects from wage growth and this should help bring price pressures down in the near future: \"The rise in unemployment is worse than we in the markets were expecting and shows a significant easing in the labour market. Entirely consistently with that, we are seeing a marked slowdown in average earnings. To our minds, not only is this evidence that there is no evidence of second round inflation effects in the economy, but will underpin a marked slowdown in service sector inflation as we look forward.</p> <p>He added that the weaker labour market will help push through interest rates cuts once the current spike in inflation has passed.</p> <p><strong>Howard Archer</strong> at <strong>Global Insight</strong> said the weaker wage growth reduces pressure on the Bank to raise borrowing costs to try to combat inflation: \"Ongoing muted earnings growth in June eases pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. It is absolutely critical that earnings growth remains muted, if the eventual next move in interest rates is to be down. Any sign that higher inflation and elevated inflation expectations are feeding through to push up pay significantly would add to already significant pressure on the Bank of England to lift interest rates - despite the ever growing likelihood of recession - to try to prevent a damaging wages-price spiral developing.\"</p> <p><strong>George Buckley</strong> at <strong>Deutsche Bank </strong>said: \"It's fairly clear that the labour market is deteriorating at a rapid pace and I think it's going to continue to do so because of slower economic growth and concerns by companies that the downturn might actually be longer and more pronounced than they originally thought.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ben Ainslie maintained his lead in the Finn class at the Olympic sailing regatta today, coming second behind Croatia's Ivan Kjalkovic-Gaspic, but beating his nearest rival, American Zach Railey.</p> <p>The 31-year-old, who is attempting to win Olympic gold for the third consecutive Games, increased his advantage to six points over second-placed Railey, who was seventh in race seven. Poor visibility resulted in the second races of the day in the Laser, Laser Radial, Finn and Yngling classes being postponed.</p> <p>\"We left the dock at 11am so it's been a good six hours on the water,\" said Ainslie on his return to dry land. \"It could have been a lot worse. In those conditions anything could have happened, but I'm relieved to have come away with a good result. A six-point lead is really nothing in these conditions ... so still a long way to go.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere, Nick Rogers and Joe Glanfield are in medal contention once again in the men's 470 event after moving up to third place in the overall standings. The Athens silver medallists began the day in fifth place overall after coming back from a poor start in the event to finish first and fourth in the two races yesterday.</p> <p>They continued to rise up the standings by placing ninth in race five and sixth in race six to nullify their 19th place in the opening race and finish the day on 25 points, just one behind second-placed France and eight adrift of leaders Australia. The Australian pair of Nathan Wilmot and Malcolm Page will head into tomorrow's rest day with a comfortable lead after placing third and fourth in today's races.</p> <p>In the women's 470 team, Christina Bassadone and Saskia Clark slipped to 11th place in the overall standings after struggling in the light breezes off Qingdao, coming home in 15th place in race five and 13th in race six.</p> <p>The British 49er crew of Stevie Morrison and Ben Rhodes made a disastrous start to the day when they were disqualified from race seven for crossing the start line too early. They recovered to finish third and second in the subsequent two races to improve their position to eighth but are still a long way adrift of the medal positions. Australia's Nathan Outteridge and Ben Austin have a narrow one-point lead over the Danish boat of Jonas Warrer and Martin Kirketerp Ibsen with seven races remaining.</p> <p>A lack of breeze on a couple of the outlying courses on the Yellow Sea led to long delays in the start of the Laser, Laser Radial, Finn and Yngling races. When the racing finally got under way in the Yngling class, over two hours after the scheduled start, the Team GB crew of Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson continued where they left off on Monday, finishing second behind the US in race seven to remain at the top of the standings, five points ahead of the Netherlands, who placed fourth.</p> <p>Paul Goodison's challenge in the Laser class suffered a setback after a disappointing race three. The 30-year-old, who was fourth in Athens and won the Olympic test event last year, struggled home in 15th place, three minutes behind the winning American boat of Andrew Campbell, to drop to seventh in the overall standings.</p> <p>Penny Clark enjoyed a better outing in the Laser Radial, winning by four seconds in race three from New Zealand's Jo Aleh, to move up from ninth to fifth in the overall standings with 25 points, 10 behind leader Anna Tunnicliffe of the US, who was sixth.</p>",
  "<p>The number of people claiming jobless benefits last month rose at its fastest rate since the recession of the early 1990s, official data showed today, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/12/houseprices.mortgages?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront\">the slump in the housing market</a> and turmoil in financial markets took a firmer hold on the economy.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said the number of people claiming unemployment benefit rose by 20,100 in July, the sixth monthly rise in a row, taking the total claimant count to 864,700. Last month's increase was also revised upwards by another 4,500 people to 20,000. This was well ahead of City forecasts and the largest monthly increase since December 1992. As a result the jobless rate ticked up to 2.7%, the highest pace in a year.</p> <p>News that unemployment levels are rising adds to concerns that the UK is rapidly slipping into a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/08/economicgrowth.economics\">sharp downturn</a>. Unemployment figures are usually the last to show the impact of an economic downturn since employers only tend to start shedding labour when the economy becomes really weak.</p> <p>The Labour Force Survey - the broader, internationally recognised measure - showed a rise of 60,000 in the three months to June - the biggest increase since mid-2006. The fourth consecutive rise in the ILO figure took the unemployment rate to 5.4% from 5.2%.</p> <p>The number of vacancies in the economy fell by 47,000 over the quarter to 615,100 - the lowest number of vacancies for over a year-and-a-half - indicating that demand for labour is wilting.</p> <p>Around 126,000 people were made redundant in the three months to June, up by 14,000 from the quarter to March driven by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/13/unemployment.statistics\">losses by housebuilders</a>, who are suffering from the weakening housing market.</p> <p>\"It's fairly clear that the labour market is deteriorating at a rapid pace and I think it's going to continue to do so because of slower economic growth and concerns by companies that the downturn might actually be longer and more pronounced than they originally thought,\" said George Buckley, economist at Deutsche Bank.</p> <p>Better news for the government and policymakers came from the average earnings figure which was more subdued than expected. Wages, excluding bonuses for the three months to June, rose at an annual rate of 3.4%, the weakest amount for five years, suggesting that the slowing economy is keeping a lid on earnings growth.</p> <p>However, the Bank of England is concerned that wage growth may shoot up - pushing up inflation even further - after figures yesterday showed the retail price measure of inflation, on which pay deals are based, hit 5%.</p> <p>The labour market data was released shortly ahead of the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report. In it, the Bank warned that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/13/inflation.interestrates\">the UK faces a painful adjustment</a>, but offered the prospect of an interest rate cut once inflation starts to fall sharply.</p> <p>Figures yesterday showed inflation hit a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/13/inflation.creditcrunch1\">16-year high of 4.4%</a>, on track to reach 5% by the autumn, as expected by many in the City. Such a surge in inflation could prompt the Bank to raise borrowing costs to rein in price pressures at the cost of deepening the economic downturn which could push unemployment up even further.</p> <p>\"With RPI inflation reaching 5% in July, an acceleration in pay growth cannot be ruled out. And even if it stays subdued, the MPC has plenty of other inflation concerns which are likely to keep rates on hold for another couple of months at least,\" said Vicky Redwood, economist at Capital Economics.</p>"
