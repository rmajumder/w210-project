  "<p>Juande Ramos is convinced he will be given the opportunity to revive Tottenham Hotspur's season after holding talks with the club's chairman, Daniel Levy, after Sunday's loss to Hull City, a defeat which condemned Spurs to their worst start to a campaign in 96 years.</p> <p>Tottenham remain anchored to the foot of the Premier League with two points from seven matches, with the team departing the turf at White Hart Lane last weekend to boos from disgruntled fans. Bookmakers made Ramos odds-on to lose his job by Christmas though having met Levy post-match, he believes he will not suffer the same fate as his predecessor, Martin Jol, who was sacked a year ago.</p> <p>There has been an acknowledgement from the club hierarchy that there were encouraging signs in Sunday's display, though Levy has stressed that their league position is unacceptable and a swift climb up the table is expected after the international break. The club are insistent the crisis must be countered by a show of unity rather than more upheaval. The sporting director Damien Comolli's position remains precarious but even that will not be addressed in knee-jerk fashion.</p> <p>Levy is conscious of the effort undertaken to secure Ramos' services from Sevilla a year ago - much to the Spanish club's annoyance - on a contract worth around \u00a34m a year until 2011, and the board cannot contemplate a search for a replacement.</p> <p>For all that, Tottenham will be relieved they cannot be handed a potentially embarrassing clash with Jol's new employer, Hamburg, in today's Uefa Cup group stage draw, with both clubs among the first group of seeds. Ramos spoke with his players following the defeat to Hull and with his summer signings still struggling to find their feet, must instigate a revival starting with the visit to Stoke City.</p> <p>\"We have to change things very quickly,\" said the assistant manager Gus Poyet. \"We can't hide. When you are in this situation everybody is responsible. I accept my responsibility and everybody has to accept theirs. We made a decision as a club to change players in the summer. A lot of the players we chose are here. If that's not working, why are you going to blame somebody else? We have to take the blame. All of us.\"</p>",
  "<p>A gardener accused of poisoning a retired high court judge's cherished flower border because he was upset at being sacked was cleared by magistrates yesterday. </p> <p>Peter Hancock was accused of causing \u00a3500 damage to a border and lawn at Sir Richard Tucker's Cotswolds estate following a falling-out with the judge's wife, garden designer Lady Jacqueline Tucker. Hancock, who worked for Sir Richard for 20 years, admitted spraying the lawn and plants with mosskiller but said he had harmed them by accident before he was sacked. </p> <p>Gloucester magistrates were told that Hancock, 45, had tended plants and lawns at the Tuckers' \u00a31.5m home in the Cotswolds once a week for more than 20 years. But he did not see eye to eye with Lady Jacqueline and was sacked. </p> <p>Two weeks later, the Tuckers returned from holiday in the south of France to find a flower border, including spectacular elephant ear plants, and grass verge looking very sorry. Sir Richard called in the police. </p> <p>The retired judge told magistrates Hancock was \"temperamental and moody\". He said: \"He had to be handled with a velvet glove. I sacked him because he became very moody and his attitude to my wife became aggressive.\"</p> <p>The court heard that Sir Richard's friend Kenneth Ryland claimed to have seen Hancock spraying his former employer's plants during his holiday. </p> <p>But Hancock told the court he had sprayed the plants in good faith before being sacked. He returned to spray fertiliser on the area to try to sort the problem out while the Tuckers were away, which was when he was spotted by Ryland. </p> <p>Hancock, of Tewkesbury, was found not guilty of criminal damage.</p>",
  "<p>The government last night moved to intervene in the race row convulsing Britain's biggest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/police\">police force</a>, after black officers announced they were in open rebellion. </p> <p>The Metropolitan Black Police Association began a formal boycott of the Metropolitan police yesterday, saying the force was so riddled with discrimination that ethnic minorities should not apply to join it.</p> <p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, last night responded with a nationwide assessment of how ethnic minorities are treated by the police. </p> <p>Smith, who expressed disappointment with the boycott by black police officers, said the police minister, Vernon Coaker, would carry out a rapid, two-week examination of the recruitment and promotion prospects of minorities. </p> <p>\"We need a police service which understands the communities it serves and represents those communities and the whole country,\" she said.</p> <p>The announcement followed an inquiry ordered by London mayor Boris Johnson into the issues raised by the BPA, and also comes after a BBC Panorama programme revealed widespread dissatisfaction among ethnic minority officers.</p> <p>The programme surveyed BPA members and found that 72% claimed to have experienced racism at work, 60% felt their career had been hindered by their race, 61% said things had stayed the same or got worse in recent years. </p> <p>Mike Fuller, Britain's first black chief constable, told the programme he and other ethnic minority officers had to work twice as hard as white people.</p> <p>Black community leaders also said yesterday that the race row, which first flared when Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur was suspended after alleging discrimination, was damaging confidence in the capital's police.</p> <p>Outside the force, senior black community figures say the discontent among ethnic minority officers is damaging the police's reputation with communities in London. </p> <p>Claudia Webbe, who works with the police, chairing an independent advisory group on Operation Trident, which tackles gun crime, said it was \"damaging black community confidence and trust in the police\".</p> <p>\"There is already concern about excessive stop and search. That, coupled with how the police treat their own BME [black and minority ethnic] officers, does not generate the level of confidence in the community about policing in London,\" she added.</p> <p>The boycott won support from the Society of Black Lawyers, whose chairman, Peter Herbert, said: \"Wherever we can, we will tell people not to join the Met until this is resolved.\" </p> <p>But it was opposed by the Association of Muslim Police. Superintendent Dal Babu said: \"The Association of Muslim Police and the National Association of Muslim Police currently support Metropolitan police recruitment events.\"</p> <p>London's mayor, Boris Johnson, yesterday attended his first meeting as chairman of the Metropolitan police authority. His plan for a separate inquiry headed by the MPA deputy chair, Cindy Butts, ran into trouble as members called for a more independent inquiry.</p> <p>Johnson said the inquiry would examine the promotion of ethnic minority officers, relations between the BPA and the Met leadership and how the force handled race and faith issues. He promised to review how independent it should be. </p> <p>Johnson also defended his meeting last week with Sir Ian Blair, which led to the resignation of Britain's top officer. He claimed he had consulted widely before telling Blair he should stand down. A show of hands by the MPA's members suggested most had not been spoken to.</p>",
  "<p>The always edifying Nate Silver <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/in-georgia-small-improvements-in-black.html\">runs some numbers</a> on Georgia and how a huge black turnout could make things very interesting:</p> <blockquote> <p>Think these numbers sound unreasonable? Early voting is underway in Georgia, and according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, black voters do not represent 30 percent of Georgia's early voter turnout. Instead, they represent almost 40 percent. Although early voting figures can be idiosyncratic , Barack Obama certainly seems to be having little trouble getting his vote out. Indeed, Barack Obama is winning Georgia right now. </p> </blockquote> <p>Now, don't get me wrong, I'd be insanely shocked if Obama won Georgia. But read what Silver has to say about black voter enrollment and possible turnout and apply the logic to other states where polls are closer, notably Virginia and North Carolina -- and Ohio. In Ohio, Bush won 16% of the black vote in 2004. Obviously John McCain won't come close to that. I've run some back-of-the-envelope numbers and it seems that Obama could win about 200,000 more black votes in Ohio than Kerry did. That's a lot of votes, even in a large state. Not saying all this <em>will</em> happen, you understand, but certainly black turnout will be far higher than it's ever been.<br></p>",
  "<p>Tony Stewart was the second driver to cross the line but still claimed his first win of the season at the Talladega Superspeedway.</p> <p>With two crashes having depleted the field, Stewart led after the final restart but was challenged in the closing moments of the race by rookie Regan Smith. When Stewart, who races for the Joe Gibbs squad, defended Smith's attempt to get past on the right, Smith dived to the left but illegally crossed the yellow line. Although he took the flag, the move was disallowed and Stewart was awarded the victory to end a 43-race winless streak. </p> <p>\"Regan got right to the bumper and, man, gave us a great push down the backstretch,\" said Stewart. \"I thought if I could keep him glued to the bumper like that, that we had a shot. When he came up in the centre, I thought 'this is bad news'. I saw the run coming and, you know, I made a counter move early enough to get him committed to one direction, then I got back down to the line quick. Man, I mean, it's a tough position to be in when you're the first guy. It's a tough position when you're the second guy. But we were able to finally get that first win here at Talladega.\" </p> <p>Smith was dropped to eighteenth, missing out on what would have been his best career finish if he'd maintained second place. His DEI team-mate Paul Menard finished second ahead of David Ragan. </p> <p>Jimmie Johnson stayed clear of two pile-ups - only 27 out of 44 cars finished the race - to extend his lead at the top of the Chase for the Sprint Cup standings. His closest rivals, Carl Edwards and Greg Biffle, both retired after a move from Edwards tipped Biffle into a spin.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris\">Boris Johnson</a> came under fire today for his proposed investigation of racism in the Metropolitan police and for forcing its commissioner, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/blair\">Sir Ian Blair</a>, out of office.</p> <p>At his first meeting as chairman of the Metropolitan police authority (MPA), members attacked him for announcing the race inquiry unilaterally and warned it would be expensive, unnecessary and vulnerable to accusations of bias.</p> <p>Lord Harris said there was a risk of creating \"the world's biggest long-grass job\".</p> <p>\"Clearly there are issues and concerns but I have experience of setting up the Morris inquiry, which was inspired by the authority, but entirely independent,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It took a long time, it was very expensive and we would be well placed to revisit some of the recommendations from that inquiry and some other inquiries that have taken place.\"</p> <p>Johnson announced the race inquiry as the Metropolitan Black Police Association <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/05/police\">began a boycott of black and ethnic minority recruitment drives</a> by the force. It has vowed to \"actively discourage\" people from signing up.</p> <p>Scotland Yard is reeling from a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/09/police.race\">race row with the country's joint third most senior officer, Tarique Ghaffur</a>, who was suspended from duty after announcing he was suing the force for racial discrimination. One of his key advisers, Commander Ali Dizaei, the president of the National Black Police Association, was later suspended over separate misconduct claims that he denies.</p> <p>Johnson was warned at the MPA that an inquiry could undermine the credibility of the Met's response to rows with several senior ethnic minority officers. Its former chairman, Len Duvall, said the authority itself was \"not immune\" from allegations of racism.</p> <p>The mayor was accused of \"usurping\" by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/03/blair.police1\">forcing Blair to step down as the Met's commissioner</a> last week. He was warned that potential successors might be frightened off the role by the prospect of political interference.</p> <p>Following the MPA's criticisms, Johnson said he would review how the race inquiry was handled and promised to work \"hand in glove\" with the authority's members.</p> <p>Referring to Blair's resignation, Johnson said the chances of a similar situation arising again were \"extremely, vanishingly remote\" and insisted he would not be \"micro-managing\" the police.</p> <p>\"I thought with the position London policing was in, I thought it was the right thing to do and I think that the vast majority of people will agree with us,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Banks and miners are leading the market lower on another Black Monday, as the financial crisis spreads still further.</p> <p>Suggestions that the UK government might take stakes in troubled banks and guarantee all savers' deposits - following the weekend's volte-face by the Germans - have added to the sense of events spiralling out of control. </p> <p>The credit crunch contagion has led to hasty weekend meetings to bail out a host of European banks, from Hypo Real Estate to Fortis, but the fear is that more may follow. The idea that the UK would be prepared to part nationalise any struggling bank has set investors worrying about whether there are other UK institutions already in trouble.</p> <p>\"European governments are looking to stabilise the financial sector by attempting to rescue some major institutions,\" said Chris Hossain of spread betters ODL Securities. \"Whilst their actions are understandable, the smell of desperation remains strong. One has to question what the next steps will be if this fails to ensure market stability.\"</p> <p>With last week's dominant factor - the $700bn US bank bail-out - seemingly sorted out, attention has also turned to the growing threat of recession in the US and elsewhere. So oil and other commodities have fallen back on fears of slowing demand. Copper is down some 5%, while oil has dropped around 4% to $87 a barrel.</p> <p>All this has left the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> 227.6 points lower at 4752.6, with not a single gainer in the leading index.</p> <p><strong>HBOS</strong> is the biggest faller so far, down nearly 16% to 168.9. <strong>Lloyds TSB</strong>, which is planning to take over the mortgage bank, is 7.5% lower at 268.75p, while <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> is off 11.5% at 164.8p.</p> <p>Credit Suisse believes the problems in the underlying economy mean bank shares will fall further.</p> <p>\"The fundamental issues facing the banks do not justify current share prices in our view (on a 6-12 month investment horizon),\" it said. \"Trading at around 1.2 times tangible book value, we think the downturn that is coming is absolutely not factored into current share prices.\" </p> <p>Among the miners, <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> has fallen 86p to 469p, while <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> is down 71.5p at 497.5p.</p> <p><strong>Xstrata</strong> fell 146p to \u00a315.34p as Citigroup cut its target price from \u00a350 to \u00a336.80 to reflect the decline in metals prices. It did however keep a buy recommendation on the shares.</p> <p>Citi said: \"We believe that Xstrata's decision to not make an offer for <br>Lonmin given the current uncertainty in financial and debts markets was the right move for shareholder value. The company's balance sheet is expected to improve dramatically over the next two years and by 2010 we have Xstrata in a cash position. </p> <p>\"Xstrata's purchase of the additional 14.2% of Lonmin's stock at \u00a319.79, (taking its total stake to 24.9%), may provide a blocking position. We believe Xstrata could wait out the required 12 month period to make a lower offer than the \u00a333.00 they paid for the original 10% stake on 6 August 2008.

  "<p>Black Sections, the Labour Party movement for African Caribbean and Asian people, is celebrating its 25th birthday. </p> <p>Four Black Sections members created a bit of history when we propelled them into the House of Commons four years after our demand for greater representation was first tabled at Labour conference in 1983. That momentous event is being marked by a celebration at Parliament today \u2013 it will be the biggest gathering of black politicians ever assembled in Britain. </p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.100greatblackbritons.com/bios/paul_boateng.html\">Paul Boateng</a>, Britain's high commissioner in Pretoria and one of those four Black Sections MPs, notes: \"The fact that this meeting takes place off the Great Hall in the Palace of Westminster where members of Parliament drawn from the ethnic minority community are to be found in all three main parties is in no small measure due to the contribution of the Black Sections movement. This is worthy of celebration but there is no room for complacency.\" <br> None of the movement's achievements would have been possible without protest and agitation. The uprisings that occurred in the early 1980s in Brixton, Bristol, Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool and elsewhere acted as a wake-up call to a society that was either indifferent or hostile to the demands of disenfranchised and disadvantaged black people.  But the legitimate calls for fair representation made by black communities whose electoral support was given overwhelmingly to Labour were stubbornly resisted by the party leadership of Neil Kinnock and Roy Hattersley, who were obsessed with defeating a rising left-wing rank and file. Despite this opposition, Black Sections won. We achieved a 500-fold increase in African-Caribbean and Asian representation in town halls around the country, four black council leaders, four black MPs, and Bill Morris as the first black trade union general secretary. On top of that, black self-organised groups were formed in trade unions and even by police officers. And the TUC created places on its general council and executive for black representatives. Urged by our communities to state our policies, we published the influential Black Agenda document in 1988. By 1990, the Labour Party finally changed its constitution to embrace the Black Socialist Society that we brought into being. MP <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/keithvaz\">Keith Vaz</a>, the former Europe minister, is its directly elected representative on the ruling national executive committee of the Labour Party. He is also chair of the backbench Home Affairs Select Committee.<br> Boateng went on to become Britain's first black cabinet minister in 2002. But, though the Black Sections managed to get \"black faces in high places\", the movement itself was destroyed from within by the machinations of an unforgiving Labour Party and some short-sighted opportunists. Many of the Black Sections leadership remained Labour members but became disillusioned with the party. We diverted our energy into building the grassroots <a href=\"http://www.antiracistalliance.com/\">Anti-Racist Alliance</a>, which helped set up the groundbreaking Stephen Lawrence campaign for justice. <br> Yet with religious prejudice in the form of Islamophobia being added to older forms of racism, we have observed a disturbing shift away from the political unity between African Caribbean and Asian people, which made Black Sections so successful.  Furthermore, racial inequality in education, employment and the justice system still exists. And new challenges, like the current youth-on-youth killings, the disaffection of some young Muslims, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/03/localgovernment.localelections08\">resurgence of the BNP</a> have developed. Some people might say that is why the activism, organisation and brain power of Black Sections should be revived.</p>"
