  "<p>Your uncritical presentation of a recent academic study alleging that \"institutional racism\" is the main factor in black pupil underachievement was hardly news (Black Caribbean children held back by institutional racism in schools, September 5). This ideological-based claim that it is teachers' low expectations, particularly for children of Caribbean origin, which make them achieve low GCSE and A-level grades has been around for decades. </p> <p>Yet the only exhaustive, comprehensive and authoritative study of the subject - the Swann Report of 1985 - categorically dismissed those claims after seven years' detailed research by leading educational and ethnic minority issue specialists in the field. One hopes that the British Educational Research Association conference will examine Dr Strand's study rigorously, as to whether his findings and conclusions provide new evidence which was not considered and rejected by Swann. </p> <p>When it was a major issue in the 1980s, this focus on a blame-laden but evidentially unproven factor - alleged teachers' and educational authority racism - caused serious black community distrust in the whole educational system, without in any way helping them to tackle the complex and multi-factorial problems which all the studies acknowledged. </p> <p>The political reaction to the excesses of many London councils' well-intentioned but ill-considered \"anti-racist\" policies (such as Brent's notorious persecution of \"racist\" headteacher Maureen McGoldrick and their wild \"race spies in the classrooms\" programme) enabled the radical right to exploit all parent and public concerns about how education was run. The results, starting with the Education Act 1988, are with us today. Twenty years on, we really should expect a more balanced treatment of such sensitive issues.<br><strong>Cllr Dr James Moher</strong> <br>Lab, Brent; author of Stepping on White Corns - Race, Education and Politics: the Brent Experience</p> <p>The underachievement of black children is not a new phenomenon. Nor is the notion of low teacher expectation leading to poor pupil performance. Bernard Coard in 1971 researched the issue in his book: How the West Indian Child is Made Educationally Subnormal in the British School System. The Rampton committee (later to become the Swann committee) reported on the underachievement of black children and there have been numerous pieces of research on the relationship between teacher expectation and pupil performance - notably one where researchers supposedly identified children who would \"spurt\" over a six-month period - and they did. The researchers then revealed to the teachers that the children had been selected at random. They \"spurted\" because teachers believed that they would. </p> <p>More damning was 1980s research into one large education authority (I shan't name it as it may have changed since then) which showed that, exactly like today, white students were put into higher academic sets (with a possibility of achieving A-grades) when their performance was worse than that of their black peers - who were put into sets where an A-grade was not a possibility.</p> <p>What is so appalling is that over 35 years since Coard's research, and 25-plus years since Rampton and Swann, for black children nothing has changed and teachers continue to make stereotypical false assumptions - and continue to fail and blame them.<br><strong>Carole Underwood</strong><br>Kendal, Cumbria</p> <p>Tony Sewell's indictment (Comment, September 6) of the intellectually lightweight study from Warwick University of the poor performance of African-Caribbean children in our schools was electrifying. It is supported by the evidence collected by Professor James Flynn of Otago University on IQ among black children in the US and the black offspring of US servicemen in Germany; the latter, not exposed to the corrosive male machismo subculture of US inner cities, have the same IQ as white children fathered by white servicemen, whereas in the US the gap between whites and blacks at age 24 is 16 points (see New Scientist, September 6 2008). It is not hard to extend the argument that the culture many children are exposed to in the UK (content-free newspapers and TV, celebrity worship and so on) has a similar effect - especially as so many white youths copy the attitudes and style of black role models, dismissing education as something oppressive imposed by the snobbish establishment. <br><strong>Mike Rennie</strong><br>Derby</p> <p>Your article was dispiriting and prompted me to look up a letter I sent to my local education authority when I resigned as chair from a secondary school parent-staff association in 2005. My letter raised similar concerns - some which related to my mixed-race daughter's experience of the school environment.</p> <p>But what concerned me then and now is the lack of a systematic strategy to address the underachievement and stereotyping of black and mixed-race children over time. This needs to be multi-dimensional as Tony Sewell suggests. It also needs to look at difficult issues such as some teachers' fear of black young people, the impact of the gun and knife culture, and the middle-class exodus that exists with secondary schools. </p> <p>It's good to hear about the introduction of study into slavery in the school curriculum and its direct and indirect impact on our economy, culture and psyche. Hopefully well-researched studies like Warwick's alongside the campaigns of parents, their families and educationists will prompt action and more fundamental change. We may get somewhere in realising the potential of those \"difficult black kids\".<br><strong>Guy Farrar</strong><br>Leeds</p>",
  "<p>McLaren have launched an appeal after Lewis Hamilton was last night stripped of victory in the Belgian grand prix. He believed he had extended his lead in the drivers' championship to eight points after taking the chequered flag in first place at the end of a dramatic race but he was later penalised for the way he had overtaken Kimi Raikkonen, the world champion.</p> <p>The Briton was demoted to third place for gaining an unfair advantage at the start of the penultimate lap and is now only two points ahead of Raikkonen's Ferrari team-mate, Felipe Massa, who had been second on the road but was declared the winner.</p> <p>Hamilton had been engaged in a race-long duel with Raikkonen when rain began to fall with three laps to go. The 23-year-old caught the Finn and drew alongside his Ferrari as they approached the Bus Stop chicane at the end of the lap but had to cut the first part of the corner. He rejoined in the lead, immediately let Raikkonen regain the position, then retook the lead under braking for the next corner. </p> <p>\"I had taken a short cut and I knew I had to let him pass,\" said Hamilton. \"That's what I did. Then I got back in his slipstream and got through again at the next corner. He hit me up the back and nearly caused me to spin. It was a great fight and I don't think there was anything wrong. This is motor racing. I think it was fair and square.\" </p> <p>The officials disagreed. After reviewing video evidence and talking to witnesses the race stewards declared that Hamilton had \"cut the chicane and gained an advantage\" - that he had not slowed down enough as Raikkonen regained his lead and used the ensuing momentum to unfair advantage when repassing the Ferrari.</p> <p>\"I didn't want to wait until he flew past,\" said Hamilton, speaking before the stewards had reached their verdict. \"I couldn't really see where he was. But eventually I could see him and I don't think I was on full throttle when he came past. I don't know how much more I could have done. I didn't do anything wrong but if we get a penalty there'll be something wrong. But we know what they're like, so ...\"</p> <p>The punishment would have been a drive-through penalty in the pit lane but, because there was not enough time remaining in the race for the stewards to reach their decision, Hamilton had 25 seconds added to his elapsed race time, dropping him to third behind Massa and the BMW Sauber of Nick Heidfeld. </p> <p>Ferrari later emphasised that they had not protested about Hamilton's driving. The race director, Charlie Whiting, had reported Hamilton to the three stewards employed by the FIA. </p> <p>Raikkonen crashed while giving chase to Hamilton on the penultimate lap, leaving Massa to cross the line in second place after closely shadowing the leaders throughout the 44 laps. \"When the rain came I saw these guys fighting like crazy but I was thinking about the championship and trying to bring the car home,\" said the Brazilian.</p> <p>Before the verdict Hamilton had referred to the race as \"the most exciting win I've ever had\". He had led off the start but spun at the end of the first lap, falling to second place before giving chase to Raikkonen. With five races left Massa has 74 points to Hamilton's 76. The 14th round is the Italian grand prix next Sunday.</p>"
