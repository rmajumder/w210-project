  "<p>There was never any mistaking what David \"Butch\" White did for a sporting living. He was, and looked in every sense, a fast bowler - with heart to match his lungs, solid shoulders, and a head not too much bothered by the technical subtleties of his trade. He could appear fearsome as he pounded in, leaping with his legs so distinctively stretched in opposite directions that he always threatened to tear his flannels.</p> <p>When he was fast, he was very fast indeed. There were few bowlers around who could summon up more pace, but sometimes he lost his momentum and the liveliness of the powerful seamer: thus the great speed merchants, such as Fred Trueman, Brian Statham and Frank Tyson, blocked his way forward from the Hampshire side, limiting his Test appearances for England to two. </p> <p>However, there was certainly no lack of consistency by him in Hampshire's 1961 championship-winning summer. Derek Shackleton's superb precision at medium-pace and his 153 wickets were, of course, a factor. So were Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie's hunches and daring as a captain, and the team's overall resolve. Yet the faster bowler's contribution - producing 117 wickets - should never be overlooked. </p> <p>White, who has died aged 72, had quickly become a Solent favourite. His set expression of aggressive intent masked the demeanour of a cheerful warrior. He proved himself a timely executioner for his county during that memorable season when nerves were exposed and hopes swayed. Never was he more lethal than in the fraught month of August, against Sussex at the United Services ground, Portsmouth. It was the match that Hampshire romantics continue to quote with joy, and the crucial victory by six wickets belonged to White.</p> <p>Late on the second day, Sussex were going well. White had earlier struggled for line and success; now he had to be persuaded by stand-in skipper Roy Marshall to bowl another over. His rediscovered form was like an optical illusion. The first three balls brought him a hat-trick, and it would have been four in a row if the normally reliable Jimmy Gray had not put down a catch in the slips. From the final ball of the over, a catch at gully gave White one more wicket. Sussex were all out for 180. It takes its place among the most spectacular overs in the county's history. The triumphant bowler did not go in much for emotional reaction, and was said to have been embarrassed by the fuss made of his feat by the Pompey crowd and his teammates.</p> <p>He liked playing at Portsmouth. A few weeks earlier, he did allow himself a grin after, in effect, winning the match there, against Gloucestershire, as a batsman. Like many bowlers, he privately hoped in vain for elevation from near the foot of the batting order. Left-handed as a bat, he walked imperturbably to the crease, knowing that Hampshire were in a state at 162-8 as they chased a modest total of 199. With pastoral pulls, he rapidly scored an undefeated 33, out of 37 for the 9th wicket. Hampshire won with two minutes left on the clock. On this same ground, he took 9-44 against Leicestershire in 1966.</p> <p>White was with the county from 1957 to 1972, and in that time took 1,143 wickets at 23.54. Four times he passed 100 wickets in a season. His style was reassuringly sound and muscular, with natural in-swing, rather than pleasing to the eye. In 1960 he was twice called for no-balling with a supposedly illegal action; no one, apart from the umpire, Paul Gibb, was quite sure why. </p> <p>His haul of vital wickets in the championship year rightly influenced the national selectors, and he was chosen for the India and Pakistan tour of 1961-62. He played twice against Pakistan, taking four wickets, but injury worked against him. In vain he hoped that there might be more Tests.</p> <p>Born in Sutton Coldfield, north-east Birmingham, Butch came into cricket by way of the Birmingham League. He played for Aston Unity and was encouraged by an invitation to appear for Warwickshire 2nd XI. After national service, when he served as a driving instructor, he joined Hampshire as a 21-year-old, taking over in effect from Vic Cannings. During the mid-60s, he helped to run Southampton's indoor cricket school.</p> <p>Gradually the fizz faded from his bowling. In 1972 he joined Glamorgan, for whom he played mostly in limited-over cricket. He was, however, still playing some club matches at the age of 50, still sharp enough to bruise a few thighs. For a time he was the cricket coach at Christ's Hospital school at Horsham in West Sussex; he moved to the county and then worked as a golf marshal. White, who married twice and leaves a son, died after a heart attack on the golf course at Pulborough.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>David William \"Butch\" White, cricketer, born December 14 1935; died August 1 2008</p>",
  "<p>It was the scandal that finally consigned the presidential ambitions of Dan Quayle to the recycle bin of history. Yet as scandals go, this one was neither financial nor personal. It was a spelling mistake. </p> <p>The incident that would become known as \"Potatogate\" was played out on national television on June 15 1992: the day that the vice-president of the United States made the mistake of taking on a 12-year-old boy in a school spelling competition. </p> <p>All was going well until the word \"potato\" cropped up. Writing on the board, William Figueroa chalked \"potato\". But Quayle disagreed. \"You're close, but you left a little something off,\" he announced. \"There's an 'e' on the end.\" </p> <p>The result: immediate and enduring humiliation. Even now, with two failed presidential bids under his belt, the memory of the potato has left Quayle with a bad taste in his mouth. \"It was a defining moment of the worst kind imaginable,\" he writes in his autobiography. \"Politicians live and die by the symbolic soundbite.\" They are also expected to be able to spell. </p> <p><strong>A parable for our times</strong></p> <p>The Parable of the Potato offers a useful lesson for this summer's graduates. Like politicians, it is generally assumed that graduates are able to write and spell with competence. But try telling that to graduate recruiters. </p> <p>In a recent survey by the Association of Graduate Recruiters, six out of 10 leading recruiters predicted a shortfall in the supply of graduates with \"writing skills\". In some organisations, the problem is now so acute that all their new graduates are sent on letter-writing courses. </p> <p>According to Hannah Slaney, talent manager at the Cooperative, the problem of poor writing skills has become a major issue for employers. </p> <p>Last year, just one in 10 applications submitted to the Cooperative was filled in properly. Most were either incomplete or failed to follow basic instructions. Some had been cut and pasted from other applications. For Slaney, the problem is that applicants rarely take time to think seriously about what they want to say. Applying online seems to add to this tendency. Other applicants misjudge the level of detail required, or the level of self-disclosure, sometimes with cringe-making results. </p> <p>\"Although we encourage candidates to draw upon examples from every part of their lives, some candidates provide information that is inappropriate,\" Slaney says. \"For instance, candidates have divulged intimate details regarding parental affairs, arguments with their partners, and their 'ostentatious and party-hard lifestyle'. \"</p> <p>Questions that ask applicants about their achievements seem to pose particular problems. Large numbers of graduates still cite their degree as their greatest achievement. With more than one in three 18-year-olds now going on to higher education, the chances are you're going to need more than a degree if you want your application to stand out from the crowd. </p> <p>When completing application forms, applicants also need to establish the right tone of voice. Employers complain that many applications and CVs are too informal and conversational. One applicant to the Cooperative, for example, wrote that his strategy for solving complex problems was, \"i relax and chill\". </p> <p>It's also vital to make every effort to avoid spelling and grammatical mistakes. Some employers demand flawless spelling and punctuation, while others operate a \"three strikes and you're out\" policy, in which three spelling mistakes mean your application is automatically rejected. For applicants with dodgy spelling habits, this can soon become costly, as this year's average starting salary for a graduate job is \u00a324,000. A dictionary will set you back a tenner. </p> <p><strong>Get it right</strong></p> <p>This summer, graduate recruiters are receiving around 20 applications for every job vacancy (in some sectors, eg the media, there are around 100 applications per job). With ratios like these, it is essential to proofread your application form. </p> <p>One applicant accidentally signed off a covering letter with \"Hope to hear from you shorty\", while another boasted, \"I possess excellent memory skills, good analytical skills, memory skills...\" My personal favourite was the applicant who attempted to impress by claiming, \"I am someone who knows my own destiny but I have no definite long-term plans.\" </p> <p>Applicants are far more likely to be successful when they tailor their application to a particular organisation, and are able to demonstrate a genuine sense of enthusiasm. One applicant to a graduate management scheme claimed that the reason she wanted a job was because \"it is a nice company and it has to do with business\". Another - obviously cutting and pasting from one form to another - wrote that her burning passion was to work for a different company from the one she was applying to. In both cases, the outcome was the same. </p> <p>Stressing the benefits of work experience is one way that most graduates can differentiate themselves from the pack. The Cooperative invites candidates to describe how they have worked in teams, trained others, and implemented new ideas. Again, some candidates are far too candid. Describing a previous employer, one applicant wrote, \"This was an awful job for an awful company.\"</p> <p>Sections on hobbies and personal interests should be handled with caution. It has long been suspected that employers have a pecking order of hobbies and interests that they prefer over others, with team sports and competitive challenges generally getting the nod over more solitary pursuits. The same goes for personal admissions: \"I was closely involved in every aspect of my former company, right up to its bankruptcy.\"</p> <p>Like it or not, writing skills are a key indicator of an applicant's ability, motivation and capacity to do the job. After all, who cares if you say \"potay-toh\" and I say \"pot-ahto\" - when it comes to applying for a job, just make sure you spell it correctly. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Paul Redmond is head of careers and employability at the University of Liverpool</p> <h2>How to be top of the forms</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Make sure that all answers reflect the skills, attitudes and type of person that your prospective employer wants. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> With application forms, always answer the questions. Avoid the temptation to recycle answers. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Have all CVs and application forms carefully proofread by an expert. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Observe the rules - word count etc.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> With online applications, avoid hitting the send button until all the above have been observed.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Keep it simple. Avoid jargon. Focus on your key selling points.<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Never resort to slang or text-speak. Clarify all abbreviations. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Show them you have done your homework - use your answers to demonstrate your research. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Avoid using the passive. Ask yourself, \"Is this something I would like to read?\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Establish the right tone of voice.</p>",
  "<p>The Great Britain women's hockey team have seen their hopes of an Olympic medal of any colour all but disappear, following a disappointing goalless draw with the United States.</p> <p>Great Britain needed a win to put pressure on Argentina who are currently placed second in group B, behind group winners Germany. But they failed to create many chances, and it was the USA, also needing a win to maintain their medal hopes, who looked more likely to win the match. The Americans had 11 short corners, but failed to convert any, and must now also accept their chances of a top three finish are over.</p> <p>Argentina need only to avoid an eight-goal defeat in their final group match against bottom-placed New Zealand to confirm their semi-final berth. With an 0-8 defeat to one of the weakest sides in the tournament looking extremely unlikely, Great Britain's women can only assume that the medals are out of reach. They will now play to determine their final position in the competition.</p> <p>The British women began their campaign in disappointing fashion, with a 5-1 defeat at the hands of the strong German team. They rallied to claim a draw with Argentina and victories over New Zealand and Japan, but the final match against the USA on Monday proved fruitless, ending an ultimately unsuccessful campaign.</p>"
