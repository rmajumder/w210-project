  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Friday October 31 2008</strong></p> <p> Our calculation of the chances of four out of five US presidents being left-handed was slightly awry in the article below. We gave the probability as 0.00009, given that one in 10 of the population is left-handed. That is the probability of any particular sequence of one right-handed and four left-handed presidents. The odds of that occurring in any order would be 0.00045</p> <p> </p> <p>Amid the many conspiracy theories swirling around the US presidential race - Barack Hussein Obama's Islamist takeover, say, or John \"Bush\" McCain's plans to steal the election - a truly sinister confluence of events has largely gone unnoticed.</p> <p>Some see the devil's hand at play in an election that, whatever the outcome, will see America make a a fundamental shift, not from right to left, but from right-handed to left-handed.</p> <p>Both Obama and McCain are sinistral - lefties to you and me - in contrast to the present incumbent of the Oval office. One of them will be the fourth left-handed president out of the five past holders of the world's most powerful office, a fact that has intrigued neurologists and confounded probability theorists.</p> <p>Obama or McCain will become the 44th US president, and within that distinguished company will be the eighth known to be left-handed.

  "<p>An army interpreter accused of trying to spy for Iran described yesterday how he practised black magic to protect the British commander of Nato troops in Afghanistan from the Taliban.</p> <p>Corporal Daniel James, giving evidence for the first time at his trial, told an Old Bailey jury how he settled in Britain, becoming a \"king of salsa\" and a champion bodybuilder before joining the Territorial Army and acting as interpreter for General Sir David Richards.</p> <p>James is alleged to have developed a clandestine relationship with Colonel Mohammad Hossein Heydari, military assistant at Iran's embassy in Kabul, providing him with information intended to be useful to an enemy. James has pleaded not guilty to two charges under the Official Secrets Act, and not guilty to wilful misconduct of public office.</p> <p>Yesterday James explained that his interest in salsa had led him to Cuba. While there, he was introduced to the Yoruba faith. \"I actually did black magic for General Richards, praying to God to protect him from the Taliban,\" he said. </p> <p>Tehran-born James, 45, has been described by the prosecution as a Walter Mitty figure with \"grandiose ideas about himself and his own self-importance\". </p> <p>He recalled yesterday how he came to Britain in 1977. He told the jury how he settled in Brighton, where he bought three properties and became county champion in the 75-kilo class of \"power lifting\".</p> <p>He said he was keen on dancing and appeared on the 1980s TV programme Solid Soul after an invitation by then researcher Jonathan Ross. \"I made myself Danny James, king of salsa,\" he said.</p> <p>Questioned by his counsel, Colin Nicholls QC, James said he joined the TA because he wanted to serve his country - he became a UK citizen in 1986.</p> <p>After completing a course in Dari, widely spoken in Afghanistan, and in Farsi, in 2006 James was deployed to Afghanistan to be Richards's personal interpreter. </p> <p>Richards has told the court that in quiet asides when in front of an audience he had to remind James that he was the interpreter, not the general. </p> <p>James told the jury yesterday: \"I think the audience did not understand General Richards. They were watching me and I thought I should act like a general. I was acting good, the public respected me.\"</p> <p>To begin with, he said, he \"couldn't care less\" about his rank. But he said he was promised promotion to the rank of sergeant. He said was later told he was not going to be promoted. </p> <p>Earlier, the jury was told a written statement by Colonel \"M\", the intelligence chief of Nato forces in Afghanistan, said emails sent by James to an Iranian military attache in Kabul, and found after he was arrested in December 2006, had not in themselves done any serious damage. He added: \"However, the implications are extremely serious. </p> <p>\"Information passed over time could help and assist a hostile state in its effort to conduct a tactical deployment that posed a threat to the lives of UK and Nato service personnel in Afghanistan, and pose a similar threat to the national security of the UK.\" </p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",
  "<p>Amid the many conspiracy theories swirling around the US presidential race \u2014 Barack Hussein Obama's Islamist takeover, say, or John \"Bush\" McCain's plans to steal the election \u2014 a truly-sinister confluence of events has largely gone unnoticed.</p> <p>Some see the devil's hand at play in a contest that, whatever its outcome, will see a powerful group regain control of the White House on November 4.</p> <p>Membership of the group extends across the political divide and into US public life, from the media to arts to finance. Apart from both Obama and McCain, it includes the TV mogul Oprah Winfrey, the Nobel peace prize laureate Al Gore, New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and Homer Simpson's neighbour, Ned Flanders.</p> <p>The driving force of the movement is not so much political ideology as dexterity.

  "<p>An army interpreter accused of spying for Iran told a court today how he performed black magic to protect his commander in Afghanistan from the Taliban.</p> <p>Iranian-born Daniel James, a Territorial Army corporal who worked for Britain's top general in Afghanistan, General David Richards, was called up to serve in the country in May 2006.</p> <p>The 45-year-old, of Cliff Road, Brighton, denies betraying Britain for Iran. In his court appearance at the Old Bailey, James claimed to have performed a ceremony as a black magic priest to protect his commander.</p> <p>James said the general was not present when he conducted the ceremony but that he used a picture of him.</p> <p>\"I actually did black magic for General Richards to protect him from the Taliban. Black magic is not bad,\" James said.</p> <p>James also told the court of his life as a dancer plucked from obscurity by the TV presenter Jonathan Ross to become \"king of salsa\". James said he had worked as a body builder, kick boxer, and ranked third in the country at power lifting, before moving into salsa, when he was approached by Ross, then a TV researcher.</p> <p>He said: \"He came and approached me and said, 'I want you to dance on a programme called Solid Soul'.\"</p> <p>James said he would travel to London every Friday to appear on the programme. Ross worked as a researcher on Channel 4's Solid Soul in the mid-1980s before becoming a presenter.</p> <p>He also told the court of giving nightly salsa lessons to hundreds of people at a venue called Club New York, which he dubbed the \"capital of salsa\" and he said he became known as \"Danny James, king of salsa\".</p> <p>James, the sixth of nine children to an estate agent father in Tehran, moved to Britain at the age of 15. He went to school at fee-paying St Mary's College in Brighton but left without any qualifications, later becoming interested in sports and martial arts.</p> <p>James, who was raised a Muslim, travelled to Cuba where he became interested in the native Yoruba religion and became a priest, he said.</p> <p>He joined the TA in 1987 because, he said, he wanted to give something back to the country that had taken him in, and signed the Official Secrets Act.</p> <p>Asked about his political views about the war he said: \"I have never been into politics. I don't understand politics.\"</p> <p>James said that while based in Kabul he organised salsa lessons, Spanish classes, volleyball, cricket, football, women's football and Latin dance parties.</p> <p>He said he played a key role liaising with officials on behalf of Richards and his team, including booking a football pitch owned by the Afghans at short notice for the arrival of Tony Blair's helicopter.</p> <p>Richards last week described his former interpreter in an intelligent but \"very complex\" character who lobbied hard for promotion.</p> <p>Richards said James' behaviour sometimes \"approached the bizarre\" but he was in an influential position because his staff \"were completely dependent on him\".</p> <p>He said James was doing a job that was normally the task of a sergeant. The court has heard that James was embittered that he had not been promoted to sergeant.</p> <p>James denies two counts under Section (1c) of the Official Secrets Act 1911, communicating sensitive information to another person and collecting documents useful to the enemy on a USB drive.</p> <p>He further denies willful misconduct in a public office.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>"
