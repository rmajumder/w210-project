  "<p>They might be small, but they have all the hallmarks of being mighty. <a href=\"http://wwwTheCareerMole.com\">TheCareerMole</a> has just two employees - co-founders Oliver Perry and Kristian Hall - but that can't last long. \"We're a lean mean recruiting machine,\" they say.</p> <p>TheCareerMole was founded last year with a handful of investment of angel funders and their own cash, and the two are based in Silicon Bermondsey - south London's answer to Silicon Roundabout. They introduce the site.</p> <p><br><em>TheCareerMole.com co-founders Oliver Perry and Kristian Hall</em></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Explain your business to my Mum.</strong><br>\"Your Mum would use TheCareerMole.com to find and apply to the right company and job for her by meeting real employees inside the company she was thinking of joining. She could then find out what's its really like to work there, before she applies and ends up in a job that doesn't suit her. There's no substitute for learning from someone who has first-hand experience of the careers and jobs you are interested in.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 How does that work?</strong><br>\"It's very simple - job seekers register, create their CV and then search for an employee profile of someone working in the company, department and job you are interested in and then introduce yourself via the website. You can meet up, ask them all the questions that matter to you while the employee supports and mentors you through their company's application and interview process.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 How do you make money?</strong><br>\"From employers who pay to attract and recruit people through the site. Candidates can contact up to 3 three people for free and any more contact credits cost 99p, though this is more of a control to make sure job seekers are putting some thought in to who they are applying to.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 What's your background?</strong><br>\"We're both ex-management consultants - but good ones, and we're out now so forgive us...\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 How many users do you have now, and what's your target within 12 months?</strong><br>\"We've just past 2,000 members and our daily registrations are starting to accelerate which is great. In 12 months 15,000 plus would be great.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 How are personalisation and recommendation part of your business?</strong><br>\"We are all about one-to-one direct contact between job seekers and employers. By removing the middleman from the recruitment equation, job seekers get personalised feedback specific to them and their experience from real employees who are best placed to assess who will fit in at their company. Ultimately, each employee can recommend relevant job seekers to be put forward to the recruitment process which helps employers recruit good people for less.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Name your closest competitors</strong><br>\"There are several other referral recruitment offerings out there which is great as it proves there is a growing market and focus on referrals. JobTonic and Zubka in the UK seem to be popular with recruitment agency postings and globally, models like these are springing up everywhere.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Any weird business experiences so far?</strong><br>\"Watching ourselves on BBC2's Dragons Den! They were actually much nicer in the flesh than the edit made out. Good exposure, but a shame we weren't on for longer because people didn't get to see our actual pitch.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 What's your biggest challenge?</strong><br>\"Helping large corporate recruiters turn their excitement and interest in the concept of our business into signed deals. The mission to build social proof to satisfy employers of all sizes from each industry is ongoing.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 How's you work/life balance?</strong><br>\"Now we're doing it full time and only working one job it's actually got better. When you're running your own business you never stop working, but you need a good system to keep yourself organised and everyone around you happy.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 What's the most important piece of software or web tool that you use each day?</strong><br>\"Probably our customer relationship management software, which helps us keep track of our client requests and leads.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Are we in the middle of a new dot com bubble?</strong><br>I don't think so. There are a lot of very good internet and mobile startups out there - with some interesting concepts that are generating revenues. Deals are getting done but I think money is being spent more wisely, both by investors and by the successful startups too.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Which tech businesses or web thinkers are the ones to watch?</strong><br>Huddle [they share office space] have a great product and team and are doing very well for themselves at the moment.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Where do you want the company to be in five years?</strong><br>\"We want to be the number one website for young professionals who want to network, research companies and apply for jobs directly. We will be helping all the major blue chip names attract and recruit the best people in their industry. Our white-label platform for companies and executive search consultants will be used throughout the UK, Americas and India.\"</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://wwwTheCareerMole.com\">TheCareerMole.com</a></strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 What do you think of the site?

  "<p>Members of the National Black Police Association (NBPA) probably did not expect the keynote speaker at their annual conference to suggest the organisation might be guilty of racism. </p> <p>But that's what happened when an invitation mix-up led to the wrong MP addressing the event. </p> <p>Instead of the former shadow home secretary David Davis, his near namesake David Davies, the Tory MP for Monmouth, was invited - and delivered a highly critical speech. </p> <p>Davies said the body's policy of only allowing ethnic minorities to have full membership could be considered \"explicitly racist\". </p> <p>He said the NBPA - which is backing and funding the Metropolitan police assistant commissioner, Tarique Ghaffur, in his race discrimination case against the force, should \"check the truth\" of discrimination claims before going to court. </p> <p>The Tory claimed it was \"human nature\" for people to blame race rather than lack of talent when rejected for promotion, the Public Servant Daily reported. </p> <p>\"To me, it is a shame that full membership of the NBPA is open only to those of black, Asian or Middle Eastern origin,\" he told the conference in York. </p> <p>\"Tackling racism and unfair treatment of ethnic minorities is something which is taken seriously by members of every race in the police force, and yet the clear implication is that white people do not share this concern.</p> <p>\"It could be argued that this policy is explicitly racist, in that it bars white people, and implicitly racist in suggesting that white people care less about racism than people of black, Middle Eastern, Asian or African origin.\" </p> <p>The NBPA general secretary, Stafford Brooks, said: \"There was an invitation sent out ... the wrong David Davies turned up.\" </p> <p>\"Clearly, he did say some controversial things and it was quite upsetting for some of our members. But it was a very successful conference as far as we are concerned.\"</p>",
  "<p>During my <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/22068/nationals-walton-to-head-eclipse-theatre\">first few weeks</a> as artistic director of <a href=\"http://www.eclipsetheatre.org.uk/\">Eclipse Theatre</a>, I have been overwhelmed by kind messages and offers of support. What has been disturbing has been the growing number of less than enlightened comments on the topic of \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2006/may/17/theatre.race\">black theatre</a>\".</p> <p>Everyone, it seems, has a really fixed idea of what black <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatre\">theatre</a> is. Everyone wants to define it. When someone presumed that one of my productions would have an all-black cast, I pointed out that two of the characters were white racist police officers. Why would they assume such a thing? \"But isn't this going to be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2006/may/17/theatre.race\">black theatre</a>?\" they asked.</p> <p>To suggest that black theatre has to have an all-black - or even majority black - cast would eliminate plays like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2005/apr/06/theatre1\">Stoning Mary</a> by <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/debbie-tucker-green-if-you-hate-the-show-at-least-you-have-passion-596009.html\">Debbie Tucker Green</a> or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2006/oct/02/theatre2\">Sing Yer Heart Out For the Lads</a> by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2008/may/25/whenigotothe\">Roy Williams</a> from the canon of black British theatre. But what is the minimum element required for a production to be defined as black theatre? To insist on a black playwright suggests that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2005/may/25/theatre2\">The Big Life</a> by Paul Sirett falls off the list. To insist on a black director means we wave goodbye to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2005/apr/27/theatre\">Elmina's Kitchen</a>, Fix Up and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2007/nov/15/theatre2\">Statement of Regret</a>, all by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2005/apr/17/theatre\">Kwame Kwei-Armah</a> for the National Theatre.</p> <p>Some might say that in black theatre, the themes and subject need to be overtly black-issue led and contemporary. But my recent and future projects, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/may/12/theatre\">Oxford Street</a> by Levi David Addai, Michael X by Vanessa Walters and The Hounding of David Oluwale by Oladipo Agboluaje step outside those boundaries in a variety of ways. And if you insist on a black producer then the \"genre\" almost disappears.</p> <p>Black theatre was born because of a lack of opportunities for black practitioners. Eclipse Theatre was launched in response to the <a href=\"http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/downloads/consultationreport.pdf\">Whose Theatre? report</a> which clearly identified institutional racism in the industry at the beginning of this decade. The brutal truth is that we are still the outsiders. I can't think of any other genre of theatre that has been as defined or \"box-ticked\" as black theatre. To define black British theatre in terms of race alone is to miss the point. Black practitioners are uniquely placed to deliver an incisive view of Britain today because we view it from two perspectives - black and white. We ask more questions, we challenge perceptions, we stimulate more debate. And this approach can only enrich the canon of British theatre.</p> <p>Black theatre is as rich, varied, complex and contradictory as any other theatrical form, but it is also able to engage regular theatre-goers at the same time as attracting a new audience. Who else can do that?</p> <p>There are more black British playwrights, directors and actors than ever before and we are in a city near you. Black theatre doesn't need any more defining. It needs embracing.</p> <p>How did Aretha put it? R.E.S.P.E.C.T.</p>",

  "<p>Special measures are needed to help the true losers from the economic recession - the poorer, white working class - if an anti-migrant backlash is to be avoided, the head of Britain's equality and human rights commission, Trevor Phillips, warned yesterday.</p> <p>He said that historically ethnic minority groups and women were worst hit in an economic slowdown.</p> <p>But it had to be recognised today that in some parts of the country \"the colour of disadvantage isn't black or brown. It is white.\"</p> <p>Phillips called for a programme of positive action to help underachieving white children in schools and higher education, and warned that the best defence against those who resented new migrants was to give them a place in society by helping them to compete for jobs. </p> <p>\"We may need to do so with the sort of special measures we've previously targeted at ethnic minorities. The name of the game is to tackle inequality, not racial special pleading. We will fail to so do at our peril,\" said Phillips.</p> <p>He told a Confederation of British Industry summit on migration that the true losers of this recession were more likely to be part-time workers, most of them women who would suddenly become dispensable, rather than the high-profile bankers and city executives.</p> <p>\"We need to look out for the wife or partner with a young child, whose husband may have lost his job or who fears that he will, or who finds that the bills just don't add up unless he goes back to work.</p> <p>\"When she applies for work, is rejected for job after job in a slack labour market, yet sees a clever young Latvian or Lithuanian with two degrees and three languages doing the job she'd like to do, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out how she'll feel.\"</p> <p>He claimed her resentment would be further fuelled by the sight of her child's nursery class with an overworked teacher confronted by a class of 30 that in total spoke 15 different languages at home.</p> <p>Phillips backed up his claim that the poorer white working class are most likely to be the \"true losers\" of the recession by saying it had to be acknowledged that while two-thirds of children of Chinese heritage and three out of five Indian-heritage children routinely got five good GCSEs, 85% of poorer white boys did not. </p> <p>Similarly, while the Bangladeshi girls who made it to university did brilliantly, there was an underclass of teenage white girls who would not make it into higher education after the birth of their first child, he told the CBI conference.</p> <p>Phillips later told the Guardian that the special measures should include specific education grants, similar to those made available for minority ethnic groups and extra help for white students to get into those universities in Birmingham and London where they were no longer in the majority.</p>",
  "<p>The gloom hanging over the car industry deepened yesterday when Honda announced a further cut in production at its Swindon plant.</p> <p>It said it would curb output by an additional 10,000 vehicles between January and March next year. In September Honda said it was reducing production at Swindon, where it makes the CRV and three and five-door Civics, by 22,000 units.</p> <p>Yesterday Honda said it had been forced into the extra curbs because \"the global financial situation has continued to affect consumer confidence\".</p> <p>The latest cuts came as Honda's Japanese parent company warned that the global downturn meant annual profits would be lower than expected.</p> <p>The cuts will reduce production at Swindon this fiscal year to 196,000 cars. Honda said it was not seeking job losses among its 4,800 workforce and that plans to start production of the Jazz model next year were not affected. Roger Maddison, national officer of Unite, said: \"Honda is suffering the same as everybody else in the car business but they are not making layoffs, which is to be commended. Instead, they are holding on to skills and people for the time when the market turns up. We urge others in the sector to take a similar long-term view.\"</p> <p>One brighter note came from Ford in the UK, which said it would invest \u00a370m at its Bridgend engine plant to produce next-generation low-emission 1.6-litre, four-cylinder petrol engine. Employment at Bridgend rose to more than 2,000 this year for the first time in its 28-year history. The new EcoBoost engines will go into production within two years.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's retailers are gearing themselves up for one of the most difficult Christmas trading periods of recent years after the latest snapshot of the high street from the CBI yesterday found that fear of unemployment was curbing spending.</p> <p>The monthly distributive trades survey from the employers' organisation found that half the shops and stores polled reported lower sales this month than in October 2007, with only 23% showing an increase. The balance of -27 points was the same as in September, although slightly better than the City had feared in the light of the recent spate of bad news from the financial sector.</p> <p>\"Shoppers face competing pressures on their wallets and are spooked by worries over job losses and the slowing economy,\" said Andy Clarke, chairman of the CBI distributive trades panel and retail director of Asda. \"Retailers have had another tough month and, while there are some winners, the majority are suffering. The sector looks set to endure a very challenging run-up to Christmas. We are hoping the recent drop in interest rates will cut consumers and business some slack as it feeds through to the wider economy.\"</p> <p>Retailers have seen business conditions worsen markedly since the turn of the year, when there were more firms reporting annual growth in sales volumes than declines. The squeeze on real incomes from rising inflation coupled with the impact of dearer energy bills and falling house prices has led to consumers tightening their belts, with the CBI finding that retailers' problems are being passed on to the firms that supply them.</p> <p>Only 17% of retailers said orders were up on a year earlier against 52% that said they were down. Stores reported that they had ample stocks to meet what was expected to be weak levels of demand over the next few months - a key period for the sector. </p> <p>With the property market in steep decline, shops selling household goods faced the toughest trading conditions, the survey said. There were also big falls for stores selling furniture and carpets, clothing and books, whereas supermarkets were one of the few sectors to report year-on-year growth.</p> <p>Motor traders, the CBI said, were having an even tougher time than high-street retailers. None of the dealers questioned said business was up on October 2007, while 87% reported a fall.</p> <p>Howard Archer, UK economist at Global Insight, said: \"While not as bad as feared, the CBI's October distributive trades survey was still undeniably very weak. October's balance was a massive 45 points below the long-term average of +18%. </p> <p>\"Most sectors reported sharp year-on-year declines in sales in October, although there were rises for a few sectors. Meanwhile, retailers remain pessimistic about near-term sales prospects as the critical Christmas season looms, with a balance of -25% expecting a year-on-year rise in sales volumes in November.</p> <p>\"The CBI survey does little to alleviate fears that the economy is set for further marked contraction in the fourth quarter after GDP shrank by 0.5% quarter on quarter in the third quarter. With consumers being hit very hard by a punitive combination of factors which have been magnified by the financial crisis, the prospects for spending look bleak.\"</p>",
  "<p>Martin O'Neill knows well the difficulties associated with carving out a career in management and believes Paul Ince, in his first season at Blackburn Rovers, should not have to endure the added pressure of being the role model for black managers.</p> <p>Andrew Cole, one of Ince's team-mates with club and country, claimed recently that his own managerial aspirations, now that he looks set to retire from Nottingham Forest, depend heavily on Ince's achievements as the Premier League's first black manager but O'Neill balks at the idea.</p> <p>\"It is an obvious opportunity for Paul to do really well,\" said the Villa manager, \"and I am sure he will take it. That should be an encouragement for other black players to move into management but I would hope there would not be the sort of pressure on him to succeed and be the definitive model of a black manager. He does not need that extra pressure.\" </p> <p>As an avid watcher of the NFL O'Neill has seen the huge influx of black quarter-backs and coaches recently when, two decades ago, handing over such key roles would not have been countenanced. He says the same kind of overdue meritocratic shift is happening in football: \"People will be taken on their merits, whether they are capable of doing their job, regardless of colour of skin. That is how it should be. Over the next 20 years we will have that.\"</p> <p>O'Neill cannot be accused of any kind of prejudice. His signing of Brad Friedel from Blackburn in the summer, with the American at 37, shows he is in no way ageist and it provided Ince with a salutary lesson in personnel management. Friedel faces his former club for the first time tonight, having played eight years without missing a game for Rovers, and O'Neill says he has become better with age: \"He's as good a goalkeeper as there is in the Premier League. An intelligent man.\"</p> <p>The same can be said of the Ulsterman and he will be casting more covetous glances at Roque Santa Cruz this evening. When the January transfer window opens, Villa will be armed with the finances to strengthen their bid to gatecrash the top four and the Paraguayan will be high on his wish list. Ince has already said Villa \"cannot afford\" Santa Cruz. Whether he will receive another key management lesson in January remains to be seen.</p>"
