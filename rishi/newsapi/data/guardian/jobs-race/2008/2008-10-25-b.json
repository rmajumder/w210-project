  "<p>Harry Redknapp will succeed Juande Ramos as Tottenham Hotspur manager after Portsmouth reluctantly agreed to allow the 61-year-old to leave Fratton Park in a severance package worth around \u00a35m. </p> <p>Redknapp told Sky Sports News: \"It's going to be done tonight [Saturday], it will all be sorted out and by tomorrow [Sunday] morning I should be in place.\" </p> <p>\"It's a great opportunity for me. It's a big club, Tottenham. I love Portsmouth and I loved my time there, we had some fantastic success and I'd never been happier. But it's a great deal for Portsmouth, \u00a35million for me, and it's a chance for me to get on and see what I can do.\"</p> <p>Redknapp expects to be at White Hart Lane for Sunday afternoon's clash with Bolton and plans to address the players before the match.<br> And despite the despair likely to be felt by Pompey fans at his departure, the former West Ham boss insists it was best for all concerned. \"It's difficult, the funds are tight. We were talking about selling players in January,\" Redknapp said. </p> <p>\"Tottenham have come in and offered \u00a35million, which is good for the club, and if we're all being honest it was a deal which is good for the club and a chance for me to manage a big club before I retire. It worked out okay for everybody.\" </p> <p>Ramos leaves White Hart Lane just under a year after leaving Sevilla under acrimonious circumstances.</p> <p>A statement on the Tottenham Hotspur's official website read: \"The club can announce that Damien Comolli, sporting director, Juande Ramos, head coach and first team coaches, Marcos Alvarez and Gus Poyet, have left the club, with immediate effect. We wish them well.\"</p> <p>Development squad coach Clive Allen and youth team manager Alex Inglethorpe will take charge of the squad for Sunday's Premier League clash with Bolton at White Hart Lane, with Harry Redknapp expected to watch from the stands.</p> <p><strong>Have your say:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/oct/26/tottenhamhotspur-premierleague\">Is Redknapp the right man for the job? </a></p>",
  "<p>It might not feel like it now, but there is life after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/redundancy\">redundancy</a>. Jim Fisher, a 48-year-old from Tipton, West Midlands, lost his job six weeks ago at the Firth Cleveland steel works after 31 years of service. 'I was down for a couple of weeks,' admits the father of two, who was let go along with more than 50 of his colleagues. 'But it's also an exciting time for me. If I don't do make a go of things now, I'll never get another opportunity.' </p> <p>Fisher was aware that his company was having problems more than 12 months ago and, with the help from his union, began retraining and has since requalified in various skills including bricklaying, plastering and even driving a JCB, all of which have helped him set up his own business. He received an \u00a318,000 redundancy payout from the employer he had been with since he was 17 years old. 'We could see the writing on the wall,' he says. 'I purchased everything I needed for my new business before I lost my job. I bought my own van and every week I'd buy a new tool.'</p> <p>As David Kuo, financial expert at the money website <a href=\"http://www.Fool.co.uk\">Fool.co.uk</a>, puts it: when the axe falls, it is 'the job that's being made redundant, not you'. </p> <p>'People mustn't feel bad about redundancy,' he says. 'The company has decided that the job is no longer required and the fact that you once filled that job means that you no longer fit into company strategy.' </p> <p>He continues: 'A lot of people find, when they are made redundant from very high-powered job, that their work-life balance has been thrown out of kilter. They work more than they spend time with their families. What redundancy does is jolt you back into reality again.'</p> <p>The economic crisis means that the number of jobless could hit the two million mark by Christmas. The number of people being made unemployed is rising faster than at any time since the recession of the early 1990s. But while redundancy is brutal and can be devastating, it is, Kuo says, also 'a good time to revaluate your life'.</p> <p>'Redundancy can be the chance to go off and do something you really want to do. A lot of the jobs people go on to are more creative,' says Donna Bradshaw, financial planning strategist with the IFG Group. She left her job in the mid-1990s, took severance pay ('about eight or nine months' pay plus bonuses') and went travelling for a year. </p> <p>It is a view that Jim Fisher subscribes to. It isn't the prospect of plastering other people's walls that's firing his imagination ('I'm keeping myself busy but construction work is on its knees,' he says); it is the opportunity to become an entrepreneur. </p> <p>This isn't just some Dragons' Den-style dream: Fisher has designed and is manufacturing a new type of builder's trowel, which he has spent \u00a310,000 developing. It has attracted interest from the UK's leading tool manufacturer, but Jim has opted to go into business with a smaller local company. So far they have sold several hundred through builders' merchants. 'If it's a success, it could make us wealthy but I also hope it will create new jobs in the West Midlands,' he says.</p> <p>Richard Bayle of Siddalls, an independent financial adviser that specialises in helping people moving abroad, is also positive about the experience of losing his job. 'Redundancy was possibly one of the best things that happened to me,' he says. </p> <p>When Bayle was 52 years old, in 1999, he was one of thousands at the Prudential to be made redundant. 'I was very, very angry at first,' he recalls. 'But then I thought I could either sit there ringing my hands or get off my arse.' </p> <p>He and his wife upped sticks and moved to France. 'I couldn't speak French, I was in late middle age and suffering from shell-shock after losing a well-paid job,' he says. </p> <p>Assisted by a redundancy package worth around \u00a380,000 after tax, Bayle set up home south of Toulouse and began a new career as an insurance broker. Since the credit crunch first hit, he has noted a sharp increase in the number of people taking redundancy and settling abroad. According to Bayle, the would-be expats are in pursuit of a greater quality of life but they also want to escape the rising cost of living in the UK. </p> <p>'My community charge [the equivalent of council tax] in France, including everything, amounts to less than \u00a3500 whereas in Portsmouth it's \u00a31,700,' he says. 'Cost of living has to be about 30 per cent cheaper in France. When you are on a pension - or you've taken early retirement due to redundancy - that's a huge difference.'</p> <p>Aj Somal is a chartered financial planner with Positive Solutions and advises employees on-site in workplaces where redundancies are taking place. He reports that, increasingly, people are seeking voluntary redundancy, with one scheme 'at least twice oversubscribed'. </p> <p>'The workers felt that voluntary redundancy might not be offered again and they might miss out completely and just get statutory redundancy,' he says.</p> <p>As outlined in Cash's guide to redundancy last week, workers are often shocked at how little statutory redundancy pay is: one week's pay for each year's service between the ages of 22 and 41, and 1.5 weeks thereafter, subject to caps. So someone who is 40 with four years' service will get a maximum of \u00a31,320. The first \u00a330,000 of a payout is tax-free, although it might affect your ability to claim benefits. </p> <p>Kuo also advises people to see redundancy as an opportunity to reassess their finances. 'Have you been leading your life according to how much you have been earning in your job? People often feel as though they are on a treadmill and the faster they go the more they spend,' he says. 'When it suddenly comes to an abrupt end, it is a good time to look at what your income and what your expenditure is.'</p> <p>Bradshaw agrees: 'It's important to keep some money aside if you are going to do something completely different or use the money to set up a business. Budget wisely and have a contingency plan.'</p> <p>\u2022 For information about your rights on redundancy, contact Citizens Advice (also see their online guide at <a href=\"http://www.adviceguide.org.uk\">adviceguide.org.uk</a>), law centre or trade union.</p>",
  "<p>Tim Adams's seven-page outpouring on the grey squirrel 'menace' (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/19/red-squirrels-protection\">'They shoot squirrels, don't they?'</a>, Magazine, last week) was a spectacular example of ignorance, bigotry and historical amnesia. Grey squirrels were introduced into Britain 130 years ago as an ornamental species. They flourished because they are sturdy and readily adapt to a rapidly changing, man-managed environment. Red numbers have dropped drastically because, like the grey today, they were killed over generations, after being accused of taking birds' eggs and damaging forestry.</p> <p>Now the grey is the villain and the red is eulogised. On the charge sheet against the grey is that he destroys red populations by passing on the deadly parapox virus. In fact, red numbers have periodically crashed because of other disease epidemics at a time when the grey wasn't present. As for parapox, news this month indicates that the red is developing immune resistance.<br><strong>Kate Fowler-Reeves</strong><br>Head of Campaigns, Animal Aid,<br>Tonbridge, Kent</p> <p>In outlining his efforts to eradicate grey squirrels, Lord Redesdale describes the Northumberland Wildlife Trust and the Save Our Squirrels project as sitting on the fence by not embracing the killing of grey squirrels. But the Northumberland Wildlife Trust and its partners have never shied away from this; we have been encouraging and carrying out control of greys for years. The difference between our approach and that of Lord Redesdale and his Red Squirrel Protection Partnership, which we supported in their original funding bid, is that we are strategic, aiming what little resource for this work we can muster at important areas where reds will survive longest. This will help their long-term survival, not killing greys throughout England.</p> <p>While it makes good press, Lord Redesdale's vigilante approach is counter to the best interests of the red. We no longer support his efforts as we disapprove of the way the Red Squirrel Protection Partnership is carrying out this work with public funds. They have, indeed, become, in his words, conservation 'cowboys'.<br><strong>Mike Pratt</strong><br>Chief Executive, Northumberland Wildlife Trust; <br>director, Save Our Squirrels Project<br>Newcastle upon Tyne</p> <p>The main threat to red squirrels is the destruction of their oak, hazel and Scots pine forest habitat by humans. The effective method is vaccination.</p> <p>Bill Oddie hasn't 'sat on the fence' about whether to cull greys either. He's against it. There is no species in Britain that hasn't 'invaded' from abroad at some point. You'd have thought the English aristocrats quoted would have empathised with grey squirrel 'invaders' since their ancestors came in from Normandy and mercilessly wiped out thousands of native inhabitants. <br><strong>Jean McFarlane</strong><br>Glasgow</p> <p>Tim Adams's article didn't give the true picture, especially in a week where scientists have been saying they've discovered red squirrels have resistance to squirrel-pox virus (SQPV). Please read our website <a href=\"http://www.grey-squirrel.org.uk\">grey-squirrel.org.uk</a>.<br><strong>Angus Macmillan</strong><br>Meikle Boturich<br>Dunbartonshire</p> <p>Given the colossal destruction to indigenous flora and fauna, not to mention our crops, caused by the grey squirrel, which has no natural predator, it is incumbent on us to try to do something to bear down on this menace. The bunny-hugging tendency may well believe that there is something cute and cuddly about tree rats, but if they were, for example, to place a micro-camera inside a nest of fledglings and take a look at what happens when a monster invades, they might well revise their foolish, sentimental views.<br><strong>Bruno Dore</strong><br>Site secretary <br>Shepherds Hill allotments <br>Crouch End<br>London N8</p> <h2>Write to us</h2> <p>Letters, which may be edited, should include a full name and postal address and be sent to: Letters to the Editor, The Observer, 3-7 Herbal Hill, London EC1R 5EJ (to be received by noon Thursday). <strong>Fax: 020 7837 7817</strong>.

  "<p>This time last year, Lewis Hamilton was on the brink of history. He was within one race of becoming the only driver to win the Formula One world championship in his first year. His instant success in a sport that usually rewards experience was a sensation. </p> <p>And here we are again. For the second year running, Hamilton's title hopes have come down to the final grand prix of the season; he leads his closest challenger, Felipe Massa, by seven points going into the Brazilian GP. Last year his talent was trumped by his inexperience, and rash mistakes in the last two races cost him the crown. What everyone wants to know is: will things be different this year? </p> <p>The indications are that they will. Hamilton has built on his great expectations. His driving has continued to leave commentators breathless, and his rivals in the dust. And, still only 23, he has shown a precocious maturity in dealing with his superstar status. </p> <p>It has been easy to forget that this is only his second year of Formula One. His victories at Monaco and Silverstone, both in wet conditions, were superlative pieces of driving. Just as impressive was the composure he showed in dominating last week's Chinese GP from first qualifying to chequered flag. 'I'm no longer surprised by the things he does,' says Maurice Hamilton, The Observer's motor racing correspondent. 'He has a confidence, a self-belief and an incredible will to win that we have rarely seen.'</p> <p>He has also shown strength of character in his ability to bounce back from mistakes, such as the humiliating error in Canada when he lost concentration in the pit lane and shunted Kimi Raikkonen, who was stopped at a red light. It was an accident more worthy of a supermarket car park than an F1 track and, for the first time in his career, Hamilton came in for genuine criticism. But after a brief spat, he made up with the press and returned triumphant at the British GP.</p> <p>Sir Jackie Stewart, three-time world champion, says that Hamilton is 'as good outside the cockpit as in it, which is very important. He has turned out to be a very charismatic young man.' This is at odds with the pitlane reports of an arrogant young man who has alienated his competitors with his aggressive driving and cocky pronouncements. And yet those who know him describe him as modest and eager-to-please, making special effort with the fans who many fellow drivers are happy to ignore. </p> <p>That he stays so grounded is probably down to his close family support. Uniquely in Formula One, his dad, Anthony, continues to be his manager: by this point a professional has normally taken over. Lewis clearly gets comfort from having Anthony around, although should he not clinch the title in Brazil, people may start to wonder if Lewis now needs a mentor with more experience - an ex-driver, perhaps. </p> <p>What makes him so special? As Stewart points out, he is photogenic, and his colour has done for F1 what Tiger Woods's did for golf. Plus he has had the 'amazing privilege to start his career with one of the two best teams in F1 - and few young drivers do'. But he also points to his innate talent. </p> <p>'The bottom line,' says Maurice Hamilton, 'is that he is very, very good. It has nothing to do with the fact he is in a good car: look what he did to McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso last year. I have seen the arrival of Schumacher, Prost and Senna, and this is right up there with it. He will be among the greats.' Now, a week before the most important race of his life, Hamilton gives OSM a rare audience...</p> <p><strong>How will last year affect your mental approach going into the final race this season?</strong></p> <p>I remember last year, going into the final race, I was really on the back foot. So much pressure was on me. I felt the whole country, the whole world... I just felt this huge weight on my shoulders. And I went in and I made several mistakes, and we dropped back. This year, because I've experienced it, I'm much better prepared. </p> <p><strong>What have you learnt this season? What are the biggest things you can take away from it?</strong></p> <p>What I learnt last season has really added to this season. All the problems I had last year, and all the good experiences too. This year, after times like Canada, I think I've learnt to take my time, not rush into things, not take too many risks, just do what is needed. Giving 100 per cent and not 110 per cent. </p> <p><strong>You obviously have a great support structure, both within McLaren and outside. What role do you think this has played in your success?</strong></p> <p>Without my family, I wouldn't be able to do anything. I owe everything to them. My dad for pushing me, and helping me with decisions. My mum - my two mums - for being so supportive, for raising me and for giving me direction. And my brother: he's never, ever doubted me.</p> <p><strong>Some people dismiss Formula One as a non-sport. How would you describe the physical and mental experience as a driver? </strong></p> <p>People who watch Formula One on TV, they see the onboard footage and they see the cars going around. They don't see any of the forces acting on a driver. When you go to the race you get the smell, get the feeling, get the idea that these cars go really fast. But when you're the driver, when you're in the car, your body is under so many different forces. There's the acceleration. Then you get the noise. You have to have earplugs - even with your them in, it is so loud. And, of course, you're taking in so much information, everything is flying past you at serious speed...</p> <p><strong>Which first corner is your favourite? </strong></p> <p>My favourite this season would be Barcelona. You're coming downhill at 170 to 180mph, which is a ridiculous speed, and as you come into that corner, you've got all these bumps, all these vibrations from the car, and you can't brake. To keep your stomach, you really have to hold it tight as you begin to turn in. The forces are really strong on your body. Then once you get into the corner, your guts go right down to the bottom, and they shoot up when you get to the top. It's very difficult to put into words. </p> <p><strong>Which of your challengers do you fear most?</strong></p> <p>I don't fear anyone. Kubica is going to be a serious challenger in the future. He and Alonso will be, perhaps, the two most fierce competitors I have to face.</p> <p><strong>If you hadn't been a driver, what do you think you would have been?</strong></p> <p>I do love music, it's something I'd love to be able to do some day. I don't believe I have that talent, but I've had a whirl, like the millions of people who do. If I wasn't a driver, I'd just try to do something good in life, and as long as my parents were happy with me, I'd try to do something that could take me somewhere.</p> <p><strong>Your life seems to have changed dramatically in the past two years - what has been the most difficult thing to adapt to? </strong></p> <p>Yes, there are demands on my time - media, promotional work, training, testing, travelling, engineering work, racing... but they all form part of the best job in the world. I've been preparing to become a Formula One driver for over a decade. To the general public it might seem like a sudden, dramatic change, but I've been expecting it, anticipating it. Some sides of it I'm not that comfortable with, like the intrusion into your life. But it's part of the job, and there's nothing that would make me not want to be doing this. I don't feel that I have to 'cope' with anything. I'm very fortunate to be where I am, and I don't let myself worry about things people might see as negative. </p> <p><strong>When you look back on the past two years is there anything you wish you had done differently? </strong></p> <p>You could spend your life looking back at things, thinking through what might have happened if you had taken a different decision, but I don't really understand the point in that. Why spend time looking back negatively when you could be living your life instead? What has been is done. I know I will always do the best I can at any given moment.</p> <p><strong>There have been controversial decisions this year - notably, your 10-position grid penalty after Canada and the 25-second penalty in Belgium. How do they affect your motivation as a driver? </strong></p> <p>Simple answer, they don't. I'm a very determined person, that drive comes from me rather than outside influences. From what I can remember, and what my family told me, I've always been like that. I'm competitive all the time - even if I'm playing a computer game with my brother, I have to win. </p> <p><strong>You are the first black driver - potentially world champion - in F1. How does that make you feel? </strong></p> <p>Of course it makes me very proud. I'm incredibly passionate about Formula One and I hope I will open the sport up to some people who hadn't really considered it before. </p> <p><strong>What sportsman do you admire the most? </strong></p> <p>If we're talking current sportspeople, I am very changeable, it often depends on what's been taking place recently. I have high regard for anyone who is excelling in what they have chosen to do. You see the passion of a rower at the Olympics who has put four years of their life into that one race, and you are blown away, and the same goes for, say, Rafael Nadal when he won Wimbledon. He has had a great year, I think he is fantastic and has been really exciting to watch, as has Roger Federer this year. I've been fortunate to have the opportunity to meet some great sporting legends over the past couple of years, people like Michael Johnson, Paula Radcliffe, Nick Faldo. I always find it fascinating when you can find out how they approach their sport, see what they do differently. </p> <p><strong>How much can you improve as a driver? </strong></p> <p>You can always improve and that is what I strive to do with the team, my manager, all the time. I couldn't sit here and tell you I can improve by a specific per cent, I just know you can always get better. </p> <p><strong>So... in a parallel world, it's you, Michael Schumacher and Ayrton Senna on the grid at Monaco in cars with equal pace. What's the result? </strong></p> <p>When I was growing up, Ayrton Senna was my hero and a huge inspiration to me. He was an incredible human being and although I never had the opportunity to meet him, I have learned a lot from him, both on and off track. I couldn't even begin to imagine what it would have been like to race him... I would be so blown away, I would probably still be on the start line in awe by the time Ayrton came round to start lap two!</p>"
