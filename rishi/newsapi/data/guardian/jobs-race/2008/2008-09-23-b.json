  "<p>Is Mrs Margaret Thatcher running for President? Scarcely a day has passed this week on which she has not paraded her intense personal involvement in the direction of departmental policies. On Sunday the papers bulged with steers that she has grabbed Mr Kenneth Baker's education bill by the collar. \"Mrs Thatcher has intervened to take personal control of the Government's radical educational reforms,\" said one. On Monday she summoned the heads of British broadcasting to Downing Street for a three-hour seminar on deregulation of the airwaves. Came Tuesday and there she was again, touring Handsworth and Wolverhampton as she had toured Teesside and Glasgow, setting out the stall for the inner cities regeneration drive on which she is intent on making the pace. Thatcherism has never been more personalised. Is this all a little much, ma'am?</p> <p>On one level, such high profile leadership is not new. Over the years, there have been other Downing Street seminars - on drugs, Aids, crime and football hooliganism - seeking to forge (appropriate word) decisive answers to seemingly intractable problems. And there have been the endless other glorifications of the Prime Minister's unique leadership skills over matters ranging from milk quotas to nuclear weapons. But the tempo of her interventions was never as rapid as it is today.</p> <p>Mrs Thatcher's concept of leadership has always been Churchillian (or what she likes to imagine as Churchillian) rather than, say, Attlee-esque. Yet for her, leading from the front is more than a matter of style. She believes - not without justice - that she has some special ability to understand the deeper instincts of the white, lower middle-class English upon whom her power is based. In her own eyes, as perhaps in theirs, she is the guarantor that their demands will not be deflected either by the old Tory ruling-class or by the corporatist wiles of the civil service. But this self-image has led her into trouble as well as to triumph.</p> <p>Eighteen months ago, Mr John Biffen warned that to win the election the Conservatives would need a \"balanced ticket.\" Though his remarks caused outrage in Downing Street, last autumn's Tory Conference was carefully prepared as a team effort. It was a great success, providing the springboard for the Conservatives' opinion poll recovery and election triumph. Yet Mrs Thatcher seems to have forgotten that lesson. Perhaps she is blinded by the third victory. Perhaps she really does believe that anything is now possible and that only she can make it happen. If so, it is a dangerous vanity. Nobody voted, three months ago, for Snow White and the twenty dwarfs.</p>",
