  "<p>Your admirable Black History timeline series has omitted my great radical ancestor, Robert Wedderburn (1762-1832). Born of the beautiful slave Rosannah in Jamaica, he was freed at birth by his rascally father, the planter James Wedderburn. Eventually he made his way to England, where his father rejected him at his house in Inveresk and the butler sent him away with a \"cracked sixpence\".<br>He became a Spencean who supported the early socialist dreams of Robert Owen, with a leading role in London Chartism. He was also a Unitarian minister with a meeting place at Hopkins Street, and struggled in the early movement for emancipation of slaves. A friend of Francis Place, he wrote the classic work The Horrors of Slavery. <br>Convicted more than once of blasphemy and sedition, he is thought to have died soon after his last sentence in Giltspur Street jail. His memory and spirit deserves a mention, as it has had in the Sheffield Early Years Equality publication for schools, Racism and Enslavement. His portrait hangs proudly in the London Docklands Museum.<br><strong>Bill Wedderburn </strong><br>House of Lords</p> <p>I was sorry that your otherwise admirable Black History series supplement on October 15 perpetuated the omission, previously noticed in a National Portrait Gallery exhibition, of the first black bishop in the Church of England, namely the Right Rev Wilfred Wood, Bishop of Croydon from 1985.<br>It was good that Bishop Samuel Crowther featured, ordained at St Paul's Cathedral London, but for an overseas diocese. Wood's appointment followed some 25 years' active service in church and community building, affirming our common multiracial humanity in the face of all who would deny it.<br><strong>Rev Paul A Newman</strong><br>Chaplain, HMP Kingston</p> <p>While the aims behind the Black History timeline are laudable, it would be useful if you could explain to readers what you mean by \"black\" history and how that differentiates from African history. It is tragic that in 2008 this fundamental error, where \"black\" history refers primarily to historical incidents involving African people and Europeans, still exists in the British media. The fact that your timeline starts not in Africa but with the caption \"Roman rule in Britain begins\" reveals all. <br><strong>Toyin Agbetu</strong><br>The Ligali Organisation</p> <p>Chris Birch (Letters, October 15) claims Claudia Jones for the Communist party of Great Britain after her image appeared on postage stamps commemorating her struggle for civil rights. He neglects to mention that the CPGB treated her to odious racial discrimination, telling her, \"We don't want a colonial comrade playing a leading role,\" and spurning her hard-won experience battling Jim Crow racism in the US. <br>Despite the CPGB and without its support, she established the first mass circulation newspaper for the black community, and organised the first in a series of events that were later to evolve into the Notting Hill Carnival. Her story is well told in a recent book by Professor Carole Boyce Davies, Left of Karl Marx.<br><strong>Diane Langford</strong><br>London</p> <p>James Heartfield's praise for President Lincoln is misplaced (Letters, October 16). Lincoln might have abolished slavery, but was an open advocate of segregation. He also was hardly overtly critical of lynching - referring to it in conciliatory terms as \"mobocratic spirit\".<br><strong>Gavin Lewis</strong><br>Manchester</p> <p>Pity you couldn't find room in your timeline of significant black figures for Samuel Coleridge-Taylor.<br><strong>Trevor Walshaw</strong><br>Meltham, Holmfirth</p> <p>It's sad that you can devote so much space to black history without a mention of black people's role in the creation and development of jazz music - which transformed 20th century music - and identified geniuses such as Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton and Duke Ellington.<br><strong>Bob Gough</strong><br>Walton-on-Thames, Surrey</p>",
  "<p>Unemployment is affecting every part of the country and the middle class will be among those who will need help to retrain, James Purnell, the work and pensions secretary, has told the Guardian.</p> <p>In his first interview since the publication of the biggest rise in jobless figures since 1991, Purnell said his department expected future unemployment to be different from that of the 1980s, when job losses were concentrated outside the south-east and largely felt by unskilled workers. He predicted unemployment would be spread evenly across Britain and would affect the middle class.</p> <p>\"If you look at the picture of employment and unemployment it was [in the 1980s] very unevenly spread with London and the south-east doing much better,\" Purnell said. \"Unemployment has come down across the country so there is now no region with a significantly higher level of unemployment and at the moment there is no regional focus to the problems.\"</p> <p>When asked how the middle classes would cope with unemployment, Purnell said he was optimistic that \u00a3100m of government money allocated to helping the recently-unemployed retrain would smooth the transition.</p> <p>\"They may want some retraining to become a driving instructor or there may be people who are in banking that want to go into another form of banking and [the training will] help them make a quick change,\" Purnell added.</p> <p>The minister announced fresh measures to cut red tape to help people move in and out of employment, signalling the government expectation of a choppy job market over the next few years. From today, claimants will only be required to make one call to update their benefit details when they move between work and unemployment.</p> <p>The department said that before today some claimants had to make more than 28 separate contacts with three organisations: the Inland Revenue, their local council and Jobcentre Plus. </p> <p>The government hopes this will make it easier for people to take up short-term work in the future. But there would be no retreat on plans to tie benefits more tightly to the condition that claimants search and prepare for work. Labour MPs and trade union leaders opposed to the measures have argued that the economic downturn has strengthened the argument against the plans. </p> <p>Experts are predicting unemployment will rise to 2.25 million by the end of next year, an increase of 500,000 on the 1.79 million figure announced on Thursday.</p> <p>\"It is a very uncertain time, as uncertain as any,\" Purnell told the Guardian. \"It is really worrying for people. People are having conversations they were not having a year ago about losing their jobs, but we have to say whatever the consequences of what is happening in the financial markets we will provide people with the help they need.\"</p> <p>He said his welfare reform must go ahead. \"We are not proposing to sanction people for not finding work. No one has ever suggested that,\" he said.</p> <p>The aim was to help people be equipped for work. \"The one thing I will not repeat is what the Tories did in the 1980s which is to fiddle the figures, and to do so by shuffling people on to inactive benefits, ... where people have got no support to go back to work and where people were not kept in touch with the labour market,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We have still got 1 million people on incapacity benefit since the 70s, 80s and 90s and it would be criminal, in my view, to say that we will take that support away from people and not require them to keep in touch with the labour market.\"</p> <p>He argued \"difficult times\" revealed the \"importance of the big state machine\" but the government could continue with plans for a bigger role for private companies.</p> <p>Asked if he feared an increase in social tension as the jobless sought to blame bankers or immigrants, Purnell said he had seen no sign of this yet, adding there were indications in the workers' registration scheme figures that the number of eastern Europeans leaving the UK might be rising as the economic situation worsened.</p> <p>In an indication of the political impact of an escalating welfare bill due to higher unemployment and inflation, Purnell said the extra costs would be borne by the Treasury rather than his department.</p> <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that the extra cost to the exchequer of unemployment would be \u00a31.1bn next year, in addition to the \u00a33bn increase in welfare payments.</p> <p>Describing the revamped service as more akin to a bank, Purnell said: \"People have a memory of lots of bits of paper on the wall, lots of queuing, actually it's very like a bank now. It is very customer focused.\"</p>",
  "<p>In a lighter moment, David Cameron could be caricatured as a rather well-paid odd-job man. He's planning to fix the broken society, the broken politics, and now the broken economy. His speech earlier today at Bloomberg was all about spelling out that centre-right policies are the right tool for the job. <br><br>The reason Gordon Brown has botched the job of running the economy, both as chancellor for 10 years and now as prime minister, said Cameron, is that the centre-left doesn't really understand how the free market works. So New Labour went over the top and now here we are, with an economic slump on our hands. The global economic backdrop that brought countries' economies almost to their knees only got a cursory mention.</p> <p>As Brown notches up some acclaim for devising a blueprint rescue package for banks that looks set to be emulated in other countries, Cameron's speech was designed to paint the prime minister as Bodge It Brown. </p> <p>With this one big speech the Tory leader declared the party's short-lived truce with the government, when it was all hands to the pump, officially over and we are back to business as usual: Cameron branding Brown an economic cowboy.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4\">Channel 4</a> is understood to be on the brink of signing actor Alexander Armstrong to be the new Countdown presenter.</p> <p>Armstrong, who is set to become the fourth presenter in the quizshow's 26-year history, is expected to sign a contract this weekend capped by a \"celebratory dinner\" with Channel 4 executives next week, according to <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/latest/2008/10/16/alexander-armstrong-confirmed-as-new-countdown-host-115875-20811319/\" target=\"_blank\">today's Daily Mirror</a>.</p> <p>Earlier this week Armstrong and Sky Sports Soccer Saturday host Jeff Stelling were understood to be in the running for the Countdown job.

  "<p>A job well done should bring with it appreciation from employers and colleagues. But recognition of an objective met does not always tell the whole story about how a task went from drawing board to successful completion. Often it is only the person who has done most of the work who understands a task's full complexity. </p> <p>From that knowledge comes job satisfaction, but UK-based exam board Trinity College London believes that, for some professionals in ELT, a job well done shouldn't end there. It is appealing to practitioners who have gained that sense of achievement from work to take a step back, think more deeply about their experience and sit down and write the story.</p> <p>This month Trinity is launching its Fellowship Diploma in Tesol Education Studies or FTCL, a qualification that dispenses with course work and teaching and asks candidates to propose a piece of professional work that they have done, or are doing, and apply rigorous critical thinking as they evaluate their project in a written dissertation of some 12,000 words.</p> <p>Candidates who have their dissertations accepted will achieve a qualification accredited at Level 7 on the UK National Qualifications Framework. This puts the FTCL on a level with an extended writing task on a Tesol Diploma or Masters programme. Jenny Pugsley, Trinity's head of Tesol, says that the award will for the first time offer ELT professionals formal recognition for a piece of serious work. </p> <p>But Pugsley warns that the FTCL will not be appropriate to all. \"I don't see this aimed at people who are simply teaching or training. It is for people who are in senior positions or have been in some kind of management role,\" she says. \"This award is not just for 20 or 30 years of honourable teaching. This is for people who have really taken something forward within the profession.\"</p> <p>The first step to achieving the FTCL is to identify a piece of work that will stand up to detailed scrutiny. Trinity is looking for projects in which the candidate has taken a significant lead in design and implementation and it offers a list of suggestions that ranges from leadership roles in language schools \u2013 developing a new course or qualification, for example \u2013 to management of projects as diverse as drafting language education policy or work within an English language teachers' association. </p> <p>Next the candidate submits a detailed abstract that sets out the aims and rationale of their project and how they are going to evaluate it, but also explain its wider theoretical, economic and sociological context and impact. They must also submit a $130 registration fee. </p> <p>Once they have had their proposal accepted, candidates will be on their own. They must gather data and research, make their assessments and then sit down to write up their dissertation and return it to Trinity within 12 months. </p> <p>Pugsley is under no illusions about how demanding this task is likely to be for busy professionals. They'll need enthusiasm for their project to keep motivated, but will also need practical skills and support she says. </p> <p>\"You have to have the time, the interest and some writing ability,\" she says. \"We are not training people. If they want some form of tutoring they will have to find that themselves.\"</p> <p>She recommends that candidates seek out a colleague which can act as a sounding board for ideas, and, if writing skills are an issue, give them editorial advice.</p> <p>Once the dissertation has been submitted, along with the fee of $950, the final stage of the process will be a short face-to-face interview or viva with an examiner to test candidates' understanding of their subject.</p> <p>So who will submit themselves to such a demanding piece of work? Pugsley expects the FTCL to have only limited appeal. \"Once people sit down and look seriously at the time and cost that will be involved, that will focus their minds wonderfully,\" she says.</p> <p>\"I don't think it is easy to place the FTCL in a career structure, and at this early stage, we can't say that it is going to help you up the employment ladder. But the activity of having to think in this way is a valuable personal development exercise, which you might not bother to do if no one is going to give you credit for it.\"</p> <p>\u2022 For more information about the FTCL go to the Tesol section of the <a href=\"www.trinitycollege.co.uk\">Trinity College London website</a>.</p>"
