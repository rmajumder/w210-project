  "<p>Britain's most senior Asian police officer yesterday directly accused Sir Ian Blair, the Met commissioner, of repeatedly racially discriminating against him.</p> <p>Tarique Ghaffur, an assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard, accused his chief of a catalogue of unfair treatment as the civil war at the top of policing erupted in public. His employment tribunal claim says Blair subjected him to \"degrading and humiliating\" treatment and repeatedly tried to undermine him.</p> <p>The claim was lodged last Friday but the Guardian has learned extensive details. Ghaffur will allege he was: harassed by Blair and another senior officer; repeatedly excluded from crucial meetings and discussions; criticised by a fellow senior officer about his language skills in a way which amounted to racial discrimination; and victimised by the commissioner in a face to face meeting over his decision to bring a discrimination claim.</p> <p>Ghaffur yesterday spoke publicly for the first time since lodging his employment tribunal claim. At a news conference he said he loved the Met and added: \"My case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the Met, in particular the discrimination I have been subjected to over a long period by the present commissioner, Sir Ian Blair.\"</p> <p>The Met commissioner has talked of having a \"long, honourable and occasionally blood-stained record on the championing of diversity\". In his employment tribunal claim, Ghaffur repeatedly contradicts that assertion.</p> <p>Only hours after Ghaffur spoke, the Met denied the claims and urged him to \"shut up\" and get on with his job. Deputy Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson said the force did not think the tribunal was necessary and would \"robustly challenge\" the allegations, which are also aimed at Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Bryant.</p> <p>The tribunal will see the Metropolitan police again challenged to defend itself against claims of racism. Sitting alongside Ghaffur, Alfred John, chairman of the Met's Black Police Association, repeated charges of institutional and individual racism in the force.</p> <p>Ghaffur claims he was undermined as head of central operations, with his opinion being ignored on key issues and appointments made without him being consulted. He claims his subordinates reported directly to Blair on key issues, thus undermining his authority.</p> <p>The 53-year-old officer is suing on three fronts: race, religion and age. He blames the commissioner over a decision to renew his contract of employment by one year, rather than the three he wanted.</p> <p>The decision was made by the Metropolitan police authority but Ghaffur says it was swayed by an intervention by Blair. In his claim, he cites a white officer who was given a longer extension.</p> <p>The longest section of the claim relates to Ghaffur's role running the Met's input into security for the 2012 London Olympics. He claims Blair and Bryant discriminated against him.</p> <p>Ghaffur says this was despite a government report on the work he had done on Olympic security praising him and another official review hailing his \"visible leadership\". He claims his duties were reduced, and he was excluded from key meetings. Ghaffur even alleges that important documents relating to Olympic security were kept from him.</p> <p>His employment tribunal claim says both Blair and Bryant harassed him and their actions had the \"effect of creating a degrading and humiliating environment\" for the Asian officer.</p> <p>Ghaffur alleges the commissioner victimised him for preparing to bring a racial discrimination claim, an allegation that if proven could add to any damages he receives from a tribunal. He says he was summoned to a face to face meeting with Blair last month and told he would be removed from his role at the top of the Met if he continued with his legal action.</p> <p>Ghaffur says in his claim that the discrimination goes back to 2000, when Blair was the deputy commissioner and in charge of the corruption unit which investigated a high-flying Asian officer to whom Ghaffur was a mentor.</p> <p>The claim says Ghaffur was subjected to covert surveillance and was the only senior officer excluded from meetings about that corruption investigation. He claims this sent out the message to his senior colleagues that he could not be trusted and unfairly placed his integrity in doubt.</p> <p>He also says that in one incident a senior officer used what amounted to racist remarks, saying that Ghaffur could not be understood when he spoke.</p> <p>At his news conference, Ghaffur's lawyer, Shahrokh Mireskandari, said Blair's fitness to continue as commissioner would hinge on the outcome of the case. </p> <p>Senior Yard sources say the force's leadership are \"furious\" at Ghaffur over the way he has conducted himself, a sentiment reflected in Stephenson's statement: \"In short, I think it is long past time we shut up, stop making public statements about a private dispute and get on with the job we are paid to do. </p> <p>\"I do not think it was appropriate for this matter to be conducted in such a public way.\"</p>",
  "<p>Deep divisions within the Metropolitan police erupted in public today after one of Britain's most senior Asian officers outlined his grievances about racism within the force, laying the blame with the commissioner, Sir Ian Blair.</p> <p>Assistant commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, the third most senior officer at Scotland Yard, today accused the Met of discriminating against him ''over a long period of time'' and sidelining him in his role heading the security of the London Olympics.</p> <p>Ghaffur, the third most senior officer at Scotland Yard, has filed an employment tribunal claim against the Metropolitan police and its commissioner, Sir Ian, in which the evidence he says he has compiled over the past eight years will be examined.</p> <p>But a row broke out when deputy commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, hit back saying the Metropolitan police denying the claims of discrimination and would \"robustly challenge them\".</p> <p>Stephenson went on to tell Ghaffur that he should ''shut up'' and get on with his job.</p> <p>\"We do not accept the charges of discrimination against us and intend to robustly challenge them,'' Stephenson said.</p> <p>\"We have only received them in the last few hours and I consider that, if these proceedings have to take place, there is a proper place for conducting and airing these matters and that is within the tribunal itself.</p> <p>\"In short, I think it is long past time that we all shut up, stop making public statements about private disputes and get on with the job we are paid to do.\"</p> <p>Speaking at a press conference in London today, Ghaffur, 53, said his case would include claims of race and religious discrimination. He is thought to be claiming a seven-figure sum in lost earnings and damages.</p> <p>In his first comments made publicly about the row, he said he had been ''victimised'' by the Met since his claim was made public.</p> <p>''My current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the Met, in particular the discrimination I have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner, Blair.</p> <p>''It is to do with the continuation of the treatment into the very important job I was doing as the coordinator of the security and safety of the 2012 Olympics.</p> <p>''Finally it is to do with the victimisation I have suffered since my grievances leaked to the media.''</p> <p>He said he found himself in \"unfamiliar and uncomfortable territory\" by launching the claim and had done so with \"deep regret'' after seeking mediation. He stressed that his claim had nothing to do with his disappointment at not being promoted.</p> <p>\"I'm content with my achievements so far. I'm not seeking massive monetary benefits and I do not have grievances against the whole of the Met, an organisation that I dearly love and admire,\" he said.</p> <p>Ghaffur's solicitor, Shahrokh Mireskandari, of Dean and Dean, said Blair's fitness to continue as commissioner would hinge on the outcome of the case.</p> <p>Details of a rift between Ghaffur and Blair were leaked in June. <br>Among those facing the allegations, thought to be compiled in a 60-page dossier, are Blair and the Metropolitan police authority chairman, Len Duvall. They have both rejected claims of racism, with Blair saying he has a \"long, honourable and occasionally blood-stained record on the championing of diversity\".</p> <p>Attempts to prevent a full-scale employment tribunal with mediation failed after the two parties could not even agree to terms for discussion. The case files were then filed with the employment tribunal on Friday.</p> <p>There is a long history of claims of <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/28/race\">racism in the Met</a>. A public inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence murder case concluded the force was institutionally racist. The Met is also being sued for racial discrimination by Commander Shabir Hussain.</p> <p>Alfred John, the chairman of the force's Black Police Association, said Ghaffur's case was \"not an isolated incident\". </p> <p>\"Racism, both institutional and individual, still continues within the Met,\" he said. \"In fact, it has not improved that much since the <a href=\" http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm42/4262/4262.htm\">Macpherson report</a>.\"</p>",

  "<blockquote> <p>The only white man you can trust is a dead white man.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Our party must continue to strike fear in the heart of the white man, our real enemy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Those are Robert Mugabe's words. They are forever etched in modern African history as indicative of the anti-white politics that took hold in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/zimbabwe\">Zimbabwe</a> from 2000 onwards, when the Mugabe government proclaimed that Zimbabwe was for black Zimbabweans and Africa for black Africans. Race was politicised to an unprecedented level and aggressive threats to the white community were carried out, namely the violent seizure of <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/2000/02/17/wzim17.html\">white-owned commercial farms</a>. White Zimbabweans were blamed for all of Zimbabwe's problems. They were labelled racists and accused of working hand in hand with white Britain in funding and directing opposition politics in Zimbabwe.</p> <p>Only a government with selective amnesia would ever embrace anything \"white\" after years of inexorable anti-white politics. The Mugabe government is one such government. <a href=\"http://www.thezimbabwetimes.com/?p=3201\">Kirsty Coventry</a>, a white Zimbabwean swimmer, won four medals \u2013 one gold and three silver \u2013 at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. She was the only Zimbabwean athlete to win a medal at the games. Coventry was greeted with a heroine's homecoming in Zimbabwe yesterday. Mugabe congratulated her \"most heartily on that heroic performance\", on the eve of her return. Gone was Mugabe's anti-white speechifying. A victory parade through the streets of Zimbabwe's capital city Harare was staged in her honour and she attended a banquet hosted by Mugabe at his official state house residence. </p> <p>It is tempting to conclude that given Zimbabwe's prevailing political, social and economic morass, the Mugabe government is capitalising on Coventry's Olympic success to deflect national attention away from the country's problems. Certainly, Coventry's achievement has provided weary and oppressed Zimbabweans with some national fanfare in a land where all else is a litany of monotonous struggle and human suffering. However, the Mugabe government's response to Coventry's medal-winning performances is part of its wider contradictory logic of race relations. </p> <p>Whites were embraced as brothers and sisters at independence in 1980 because it was politically expedient. In 2000 they were disowned as the political necessities of defeating the burgeoning opposition MDC took centre stage. Mugabe rants and raves against white people and Britain yet he professes his undying affection and respect for the British royal family. Indeed there is a lot about Mugabe that is British, from his accent to his dress code to his love for cricket. English remains Zimbabwe's national language, 28 years after colonialism.</p> <p>The contradictions are starker with regard to the majority black population, which the Mugabe government has attempted to indoctrinate with its racist politics. Anti-white politics has not aroused black Zimbabweans against white people. Even during the explosive land seizures phase, to a greater extent attacks on white Zimbabweans remained linked to state-sponsored farm invasions and official pronouncements. Spontaneous nationwide populist looting, beatings and lynching of white people never occurred. Four white MDC members were elected to parliament at the height of the farm seizures.</p> <p>One of them, a farmer called <a href=\"http://www.freeroybennett.com/\">Roy Bennet</a>, had his commercial farm invaded by war-veterans in 2000 but scored a resounding electoral victory none the less. Another elected white parliamentarian, <a href=\"http://davidcoltart.com/\">David Coltart</a>, was a Rhodesian police officer when he was 18 years old. In spite of the Mugabe government's use of Coltart's history against him, Coltart remains a popular politician.</p> <p>The Mugabe government's \"hatred\" of whites has not filtered down to the average black Zimbabwean. Most black Zimbabweans are aware that the root cause of Zimbabwe's problems is, ultimately, the Mugabe government. Blaming white Zimbabweans and white Britain will never wash this charge away. Black Zimbabweans see through it \u2013 just as they see the irony in the Mugabe government's taking of Coventry to its bosom.</p>"
