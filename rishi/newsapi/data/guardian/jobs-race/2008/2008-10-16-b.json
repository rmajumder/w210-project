  "<p>Of all the adjectives that could be applied to AC/DC, \"unique\" is perhaps the least likely. There must be hundreds of bands exactly like them in bars and pubs around the world, ruining locals' attempts to have a quiet pint, performing songs called things like Spoilin' for a Fight, attempting to leaven their hackneyed blues-rock with a few risqu\u00e9 gags about tits and bums. And yet, in one sense, AC/DC are unique. It's impossible to think of another band that's been praised so much and rewarded so lavishly for doing so little, at least artistically.</p> <p>Their sound is like Noel Edmonds' hairstyle: it was hoisted into place at some point in 1974 and has remained almost entirely unaltered ever since. Those who queue up to buy Black Ice, like those who queued up to buy its 15 predecessors, do so knowing precisely what they're going to get. There will be staccato guitar riffs, Angus Young's admirably unflashy and economical soloing and songs with rock'n'roll in the title. And there will be smutty puns. No one over the age of 12 or outside the offices of Viz has ever made so much capital from the words \"big\", \"hard\" \"stiff\", \"up\" and \"balls\".</p> <p>You could perhaps compare AC/DC's dogged single-mindedness to that of the Ramones, but even they felt the need to briefly adopt the warp-speed stylings of hardcore punk in the mid-80s, which by AC/DC's standards marks them out as worrying dilettantes. And the Ramones split up after 22 years. Nothing - not line-up changes, changing tastes nor even death - can flatline AC/DC's career. If the global warming doomsayers' worst predictions are realised and the world is entirely subsumed beneath a flood, there seems the distinct possibility you will find AC/DC bobbing about atop the deluge, still gamely performing a hard-edged blues-rock number, probably called something like Balls Deep.</p> <p>A cynic might say that the kind of person who can distinguish a good </p> <p>AC/DC album from a bad one is like those faintly disturbing wine buffs who can tell you the terroir in which grapes were grown just by holding a glass to the light: it's a specialist skill garnered through a lifetime of intensive research, a considered judgment based on infinitesimal differences, entirely beyond the ken of ordinary mortals. The cynic has a point, although it's pretty obvious even to a layman that much of the band's thrilling early malevolence departed with their late lead vocalist Bon Scott - a man rejected by the Australian army on the grounds of being \"socially maladjusted\" - and that their sound reached a peak of perfection on Highway to Hell and Back in Black, the albums made immediately before and after Scott's death. </p> <p>There are moments when Black Ice boasts the same irresistible appeal to the lower self with which those albums are packed, when AC/DC's sound seems fundamental and undeniable: the crunching chords with which the chorus of Rock 'N Roll Dream introduces itself, the gripping slide guitar riff of Stormy May Day, the way Young's guitar weaves and stabs around Brian Johnson's vocal during War Machine's verses, She Likes Rock 'N Roll's gleefully idiotic chant of a chorus. Equally, there are moments where the most remarkable thing about AC/DC seems to be the prodigious feat of memory that enables the members to recall which song they're playing. </p> <p>But Black Ice clearly isn't a record particularly interested in what the layman thinks: if you've sold 200m albums worldwide, you don't really need to go around touting for new clients. It's a record aimed at the band's existing audience, and far more important than any qualitative highs and lows is the fact that everything you might expect is present and correct. Black Ice delivers not just songs called Rock 'N' Roll Dream and She Likes Rock 'N Roll, but one called Rock 'N Roll Train as well: a veritable bumper harvest. If there isn't actually a song with \"balls\" in the title, there is at least Big Jack, the titular hero of which can boast among his many attributes \"a full sack\". It's business as usual, and it's a brave or foolhardy soul who would bet against business being extremely brisk.</p>",
  "<p>Two months after the Georgia crisis, western policymakers are still scratching their heads over what to \"do\" about Russia. The Bush administration, in financial meltdown and heading for the exit, has little useful to say. White House hopefuls Barack Obama and John McCain both identify a reviving challenge from the east but give few clues to how they would deal with it.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/president/debates/transcripts/first-presidential-debate.html\">first presidential debate</a> Obama acted tough, warning that \"a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the [Caucasus] region ... You cannot be a 21st-century superpower and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.\" McCain's rhetoric was similarly offensive. \"Russia has now become a nation fuelled by petrodollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government,\" he said.</p> <p>European countries that rely on Russian energy but fear Moscow's authoritarian new nationalism are less acerbic but no less critical. Yet despite numerous policy reviews ordered after the South Ossetia-Abkhazia conflicts erupted, they also lack a coherent idea of how to proceed.</p> <p>While all parties agree on the undesirability of a new cold war, the EU has again <a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/eu-russia-pact-hold-georgia-talks-collapse/article-176445\">delayed a decision</a> on resuming strategic partnership negotiations with Moscow. Yesterday, European-sponsored Russia-Georgia \"peace\" talks in Geneva were suspended almost before they got started. Next month's planned EU-Russia summit looks like being a very awkward affair.</p> <p>American name-calling and European waffling have further antagonised Moscow, making matters worse. Possibly in reaction to this, influential Russia experts in Washington are now arguing with growing force that the stand-off cannot be allowed to deteriorate \u2013 and that the next US president and his allies must take a more constructive, less antagonistic approach, if only out of enlightened self-interest.</p> <p>\"The danger is the next administration, whoever is in charge, may be trapped in a confrontation with Russia, with Georgia at the top of the agenda, when many other issues, such as Iran, should be taking precedence,\" a US government intelligence analyst said.</p> <p>\"Bilateral relations are really bad, as bad as most people can remember. They won't improve until after the elections, and perhaps not then. Georgia is not necessarily over and we're worried about Ukraine. It's possible the Russians will come up with some kind of legal claim to Sevastopol [where Russia's Black Sea fleet leases a base]. Nato membership for Georgia and Ukraine is a red line for Russia but both Obama and McCain are pushing for it,\" the analyst said.</p> <p>Joining the fray, two former US secretaries of state, Henry Kissinger and George Schultz, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/07/AR2008100702439_pf.html\">warned</a> recently \"this drift towards confrontation must be ended\". They said the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/04/20080406-5.html\">strategic framework</a> adopted by George Bush and the then Russian president Vladimir Putin in Sochi in April this year was a basis for rebuilding ties based on mutual interest. Global non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, energy, climate change, and cooperation on ballistic missile defence were all pressing issues requiring enhanced cooperation.</p> <p>Kissinger and Schultz also argued the problem should be kept in perspective. Russia was not as powerful, militarily, economically or demographically, as it might seem and Russian leaders knew this. \"What they have sought, sometimes clumsily, is acceptance as equals in a new international system rather than as losers of a cold war to whom terms could be dictated.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=22178&amp;prog=zru\">Calls for a new start</a> based on mutual respect have also come from six former US and Russian ambassadors, including Thomas Pickering and Yuri Dubinin, who issued a statement urging \"joint work on global issues where our two nations have the responsibility to lead\". In particular, they said, the two countries urgently needed to update their strategic and other arms controls agreements.</p> <p>Analysts say significant damage inflicted on Russia's economy and businesses by the global financial crisis, and to a lesser degree by Georgia-related western disinvestment, may have sobered Putin and his protege-president, Dmitri Medvedev. The crisis has helped drive home the increasing interdependence of Russia and the west, whatever hostile postures politicians on either side may adopt from time to time.</p> <p>It was no good Condoleezza Rice, the current US secretary of state, expecting Russia's help on Iran or North Korea while attacking it for safeguarding what it saw as legitimate regional interests, wrote <a href=\"http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=22206&amp;prog=zru\">Masha Lipman</a> of the Carnegie Endowment's Moscow Centre in the Washington Post. Her successor needed to be more imaginative. \"The current approach \u2013 seeking to punish aggressive, defiant Russia but working with Moscow in vital areas of common interest \u2013 is not sustainable.\" Lipman went on: \"US anger is only making things worse. The risk of Russia slipping towards an isolationist course and a militarised economy is growing \u2026 The foundations of US policy towards Russia must be revised.\"</p>",

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338668531\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1859662862_US-Elections-LT-Black-Roanoke-To-Brightcove-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>The trouble with aspiring to a post-racial presidential candidacy is that the racial realities of America still exist. </p> <p>Segregation (de facto rather than de jure), inequality and distrust persist - hardly surprising when you think how recently racism was legal and how much cultural, social and economic capital has been invested in it.</p> <p>So the fact that Barack Obama has a race problem should hardly come as a shock. The fact that he would have a race problem in north-west Roanoke, the black part of town, however, offers pause for thought. </p> <p>The issue here is not that African-Americans are not excited about this election or Obama's candidacy - they most definitely are. The enthusiasm is so close to the surface that you can pretty much stop any black person of pretty much any age or class on the street and talk to them about the election. You don't have to ask them who they're going to support. It's understood.</p> <p>The issue is that some of the city's black leaders feel the Obama campaign is unnecessarily alienating members of the black community because it is ignoring their local knowledge and connections. \"I don't think it's intentional,\" explains Virginia House delegate <a href=\"http://dela.state.va.us/dela/MemBios.nsf/a7b082ef6ed01eac85256c0d00515644/38e2cb5825d36ab98525738a0052b612?OpenDocument\">Onzlee Ware</a>, who has a good relationship with the local campaign. \"But sometimes intentions are not really the issue. Some black people have felt a little left out.\"</p> <p>This is serious. If Obama is going to win a state like Virginia, which is 20% black and 100% southern, it must win cities like Roanoke (which is 25% black) by a significant margin. It simply cannot do that without the black vote. If African-Americans have a problem with the Obama campaign, then the Obama campaign has a problem.</p> <p>Ware, and some other black elders in town, have taken it upon themselves to use their own funds to mobilise the black community, fearing that a failure to do so might result in Obama failing to reach his full potential come election day.</p> <p>\"The older crowd just don't connect with a 20-year-old white person telling a 50-year-old black person what to do,\" explains Ware. \"Especially how to run their own communities. And then they get discouraged and go back to their communities.\" </p> <p>Whether this represents a generational tension between a local black leadership demanding a gatekeeper role and a national campaign that believes that role is no longer necessary is a moot point. By the time we have worked that out it will no longer matter.</p> <p>\"This is a historic moment,\" says Ware. \"And I don't want to sit down on November 5 and have anybody say it was on me ... We don't have time for no pity party.\"</p> <p>The essential problem is rooted not in race but the dislocation between the rhetoric and reality associated with Obama's campaign. The campaign draws on the energy, commitment and engagement of huge numbers of volunteers - many of whom are working every spare hour to get Obama elected. In that respect, the grassroots nature of his support is very real and central to the strength of his organisation.</p> <p>That has lead some people to mistake it for a movement, when in fact it is nothing of the kind. It's a professionally run electoral machine where orders come from the top down. Those who are involved do not have any say in policy, strategy or direction. They do as they are asked. That is not a criticism. It is a description.</p> <p>The question is how the campaign that has arrived with orders from elsewhere gels and connects with the political structures and cultures that existed before it got there and will remain once it is gone. Where race in Roanoke is concerned, that is no straightforward task.</p> <p>For a small southern town with a sizeable black community the town got through the civil rights era pretty much unscathed. As most people, both black and white, tell it, the city's black elders had a meeting with the city's elected officials and they decided to desegregate. And so the signs came down. There was no marching, sit-ins, hoses, demonstrations, heads cracked, jails filled or lives lost.</p> <p>The benefits of this are clear. The trauma of open confrontation that blighted so many southern towns during that time was not a factor here. The transition from apartheid to normality was handled with the kind of businesslike determination that is rare for an issue of that magnitude.</p> <p>But there were other things that came with the struggles of the civil rights movement that Roanoke lacks. Just two hours drive away in Greensboro, North Carolina, a sit-in by four black teenagers in Woolworths galvanised an entire community. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2000/jul/22/garyyounge\">few years ago</a>, Franklin McCain, one of the youngsters involved, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1578064880/ref=s9sdps_c3_14_img1-rfc_p-frt_p-3215_g1-3102_p?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=1FG8DTW1KJ67EAGJ85YB&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=436516001&amp;pf_rd_i=507846\">told me</a>: \"On the day that I sat at that counter I had the most tremendous feeling of elation and celebration. I felt that in this life nothing else mattered. I felt like one of those wise men who sits cross-legged and cross-armed and has reached a natural high.</p> <p>\"Nothing else has ever come close. Not the birth of my first son nor my marriage. And it was a cruel hoax, because people go through their whole lives and they don't get that to happen to them.\" </p> <p>Black Roanoke never had that moment: a collective period of resistance, struggle and defiance. Consequently white Roanoke was never truly confronted. The city's political class successfully negotiated so that African-Americans could eat where they wanted. But that didn't mean black people could afford everything on the menu. </p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTGeoSearchByListServlet?ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&amp;_lang=en&amp;_ts=242180125919\">census</a>, the median household income of a black family in Roanoke is less than three quarters than of a white family; black families are almost three times more likely than white families to earn less than $20,000 a year, and almost five times less likely to earn more than $150,000.</p> <p>Nonetheless, black Roanoke has had many other moments. For 17 years, from 1975 to 1992, the city had a black mayor, Noel C Taylor. \"If you look at the number of African-Americans we have elected to political office, for a town this size, it's very phenomenal,\" says Ware.</p> <p>So white people in Roanoke have already shown that they are comfortable voting for black politicians. And local black leaders clearly know how to mobilise black voters. The question, with less than three weeks before polling day, is whether the Obama campaign can harness that knowledge and make it work for their candidate on a scale yet to be seen. </p> <p>\"We know how to do this in this area because we do it all the time and we know who the people are,\" says Richard Chub, a 72-year-old former principal and black political activist. </p> <p>\"People say they're going to vote but you have to get them to the polls and for that you need to know who they are.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>The latest instalment in our series of classic reports comes from October 1968 and the Mexico Olympics. Typically this series singles out the work of a particular writer; in looking at the black power demonstrations though we have picked out a series of articles, showing how the Guardian covered the unfolding controversy over a series of successive days. Please note, we've kept the language as it originally appeared in the paper, as politically incorrect as it may seem today.</strong></p> <p><strong>When the story of Smith and Carlos's demonstration first broke, the Guardian's editors appear to have had different priorities for the front page. The news of the black power salute was confined to the final paragraph of a story about Lilian Board's silver medal in the women's 400m. Almost an afterthought in a story of British success, the paper contained only the briefest mention of the protest:</strong></p> <p>The 200 metres gold medal went to Tommie Smith, of the United States. The time, 19.8 sec, is a new Olympic record and beats the existing ratified world record. When Smith and John Carlos, another American Negro, took the bronze in the 200 metres, were standing on the victory podium, they raised black-gloved fists in a black power salute. As they walked from the arena, many Americans booed them. </p> <p><strong>Inside the sport section, John Samuel wrote this report of the post-race press conference. his piece gives an interesting insight into the general ferment in the Olympic atmosphere. While history remembers Carlos and Smith, the other details of the racial tension so prevalent at the Games, which Samuel mentions here, have been largely forgotten:</strong></p> <h2>Smith and Carlos show a keen sense of publicity</h2> <p>Although every athletics expert was aware that the United States Negro athletes might protest, the manner of it surprised many in the Olympic Stadium here last night. It was more restrained and yet more effective than some had thought. There was the possibility that Tommie Smith or John Carlos, overwhelming favourites for the sprint events, might refuse to appear at the medals ceremony. In fact, both showed a keen awareness of the publicity values involved, and their appearance in black socks and black scarves, and each with a single black glove, Smith's on the right hand, Carlos's on the left, showed a knowledge of public relations equalled only by Cassius Clay, now Mohammad Ali. <br> At the press conference afterwards, the same awareness was apparent. The representatives of the world's press crowded into a room perhaps 40 feet by 30. The organisation insisted that questions and replies were put in English, Spanish and French. </p> <p>International press conferences usually begin with pussy-footing questions of remarkable banality. The first question to Carlos was why he looked over his left shoulder and whether it cost him second place \u2013 a good technical question, but utterly remote from the emotional context of the occasion. </p> <p>Carlos answered it carefully, saying that he was a little troubled with a leg and wanted to make sure that Smith was all right and could come through. This ignored the aspect that the Australian, Peter Norman, was on his right side and came bursting through to take second place in a manner neither US runner could have appreciated. </p> <p>Questions concerning which coach had meant most to Smith was hooted off court by all except the conscientious interpreters, who went through question and formal reply in all three languages. Finally Carlos lost patience and burst out with the statement: \"We are black and we are proud to be black in white America. Black Americans, he said, would understand the nature of their demonstration.<br> \"We are not a show horse doing a performance, so if we do a good job we get paid some peanuts. All through these Olympics I hear them say, 'Boy, boy, boy, you're doing well.' I am tired of that. I want the whole press of the world to hear what I say and either say it as I say it or not say it at all.\"  Carlos said he had given his medal to his wife. If people thought that they were being bad, they should look ahead to 1972. Africans were winning more and more. \"1972 is going to be mighty rough,\" he said. In the meantime, in the village there was a curious incident involving Poles and Guineans. The Poles objected to the Guineans singing tribal songs. Their riposte was to drop plastic bags filled with water on the Guineans' heads. The Guineans responded by throwing stones and slates. The Kenyans, at a press conference, were at pains to say that they no longer had a white coach. The old arguments between Left and Right, East and West, Communist and Conservative, suddenly seemed old hat. </p> <p>The US team officials were obviously left with a problem. What, if any, disciplinary action should be taken? \"I'd pack them all back home,\" one British official said trenchantly. He perhaps has no White House to deal with. </p> <p><strong>By the following day however, the news agenda had clearly changed. The Guardian's front page on October 17 was given over to coverage of the race controversy unfolding in Mexico City, bumping aside news of John Lennon's arrest for marijuana possession and a story about a 250,000-tonne butter surplus within the EEC.</strong></p> <h2>Negroes give another display of Black Power</h2> <p>There was another Black Power demonstration here today by the three American Negro medal winners in the Men's 400m. But it was more restrained than yesterday's demonstration by Tommie Smith and John Carlos after the 200m event. </p> <p>The 400-metres winner, Lee Evans, who had a world record time of 43.8 seconds, and his colleagues Larry Smith and Ron Freeman, who took silver and bronze, mounted the rostrum to receive their medals wearing black berets. When their names were announced they raised their fists in salute. </p> <p>As the American anthem was played they removed their berets. It was a demonstration less than dramatic, yet having greater respect for their national flag than that of their colleagues who were in the medal presentation ceremony yesterday. It ignored a warning from the US team officials that any Negroes would be sent home if they staged similar demonstrations.</p> <p><em>Washington denial</em></p> <p>Smith and Carlos were expelled from the American team late last night for their display at the rostrum. They were also said to have had their credentials withdrawn by the State Department, but in Washington this was denied. </p> <p>This disciplinary action, however, recoiled within the American team. There was a meeting of all the Negro members and suggestions of \"important action\" later, including a walk-out from the Olympics.</p> <p>At a press conference after today's Black Power demonstration, Freeman said they had worn their berets to keep dry from the rain. The room burst into laughter at this. </p> <p>He added: \"If I can't run 43.8 I wouldn't be at school now. I feel I won this medal for black people all over the world.\"</p> <p>Evans said he had become a member of the Olympic committee for Human Rights and this had taught him a great deal about people. \"We received thousands of letters from those who say they hate us. It wasn't until I joined a movement like this that I realised what we were up against and what people where could really be like.\"</p> <p>He said he hoped to run again for the US team against Europe in Stuttgart.</p> <p><em>Responsible</em></p> <p>The American decision to expel Smith and Carlos came soon after the International Olympic Committee had publicly accused them of violating one of the basic principles of the Olympics \u2013 not to mix politics with sport. It said they had used the victory celebration to \"advertise their domestic political views\" and made it clear it held the United States Olympic Committee responsible for their conduct.</p> <p>The USOC then put out their own statement apologising to the IOC and the Mexican organising committee. This was a turnabout, for earlier in the day Mr Roby had said there would be no action. The US statement said:</p> <p>\"The USOC expresses its profound regrets to the IOC, to the Mexican Organising Committee and to the people of Mexico for the discourtesy displayed by two members of the team in departing from tradition during a victory ceremony at the Olympic Stadium on October 16.</p> <p>\"The untypical exhibitionism of these athletes also violates the basic standards of sportsmanship and good manners which are highly regarded in the US, and therefore the two men involved are suspended forthwith from the team and ordered to remove themselves from the Olympic village.</p> <p>\"This action is taken in the belief that such immature behaviour is an isolated incident. However if further investigation or subsequent events do not bear out this view, the entire matter will be reevaluated. A repetition of such events by the members of the US team can only be considered a willful disregard of Olympic principles that would warrant the imposition of the severest penalties at the disposal of the USOC.\"</p> <p><em>'Pretty hard'</em></p> <p>The US team manager, Ken Treadway, said he was glad Carlos and Smith had been suspended. \"Don't you think they deserve it?\" he asked. The Negro athletes were divided, however, in their opinions. Vincent Matthews, of New York, a member of the 4x400m relay team, said he sympathised with the demonstration. \"It was just to show we have power, haven't we?\" He would consider joining any boycott of the Games.</p> <p>But the Negro boxer, Art Reddan, said he would not join any boycott: \"I have waited four years for this opportunity and I am not going to throw it away now. I am just going for the gold.\"</p> <p>Tom McGibbon, the reserve for the single sculls, told me: \"That's a pretty hard decision to take, kicking anyone out of the team. They knew long before they came that the boys might make some form of protest so that was when they should have done something about it.\"</p> <p><strong>At no point does it appear that the Guardian managed to successfully anticipate the judgement history would make on the respective rights and wrongs of the black athletes and the IOC and USOC. The Observer however, in its leader the following sunday, deserves recognition for reaching this bold verdict, which would be vindicated by future opinion:</strong></p> <h2>MEXICO: Black dignity </h2> <p>The American Olympic Committee has made a crashing mistake in sending back the Negro athletes who gave the Black Power salute during the medal-awarding ceremony. In making this gesture, these men were dedicating their victory to their black fellow-countrymen and using the occasion to ventilate their very real grievances. They could scarcely have done so less violently or with greater dignity: they deserved and probably won admiration, not condemnation.</p>"
