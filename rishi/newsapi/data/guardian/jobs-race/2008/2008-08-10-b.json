  "<p>The soul singer-songwriter Isaac Hayes, known for his gravelly voice, shaven head and copious jewellery, died on Sunday at his home in Memphis, Tennessee. He was 65.</p> <p>Hayes was found by family members, who discovered him lying next to a treadmill in a basement room at his home. Sheriff's deputies performed CPR until paramedics arrived. He was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead an hour later.</p> <p>Hayes, a distinctive and flamboyant figure among the black rhythm and blues stars of the early 1970s, found fame later in his career as the voice of Chef, the laid-back womaniser on the cartoon series South Park.</p> <p>But it was his hit song for the soundtrack of the blaxploitation movie Shaft that made and cemented his reputation. An atmospheric blend of Hayes's lover-man vocals, breathless backing singers and a funk-fuelled wah-wah guitar arrangement, Shaft - the song and the character - became synonymous with black urban cool. It also provided Hayes with an image that stayed with him for the rest of his career. </p> <p>The Theme From Shaft, released in 1971 was, Hayes later told an interviewer, \"like a shot heard around the world\".</p> <p>He gave a memorable performance of it at the Oscar ceremony in 1972, scooping the Academy Award for best original song. The song and the film soundtrack also won him two Grammy awards.</p> <p>That success, coming before his 30th birthday, marked the end of the first stage of Hayes's career, a journey that had seen him take a familiar route for many black performers.</p> <p>But four years later Hayes was declared bankrupt following a series of financial problems at Stax Records. He lost his home, much of his personal property and forfeited the right to royalties from his past hits.</p> <p>Hayes was raised in a tin shack in Covington, Tennessee, 30 miles north of Memphis, by his grandparents following the death of his mother. His father left the family home when Hayes was 18 months old.</p> <p>When Hayes was six, the family moved to Memphis. His intention to become a doctor was derailed after he won a singing contest. After jobs including shining shoes on the city's famous Beale Street and gigging in southern juke joints, Hayes was hired by Stax in 1964 as a backup pianist. He worked with Otis Redding and others before forming a songwriting partnership with David Porter. The two went on to write R&amp;B numbers such as Soul Man and Hold On, I'm Coming, both hits for the duo Sam and Dave.</p> <p>The reward was a recording contract, which led to his first album, Presenting Isaac Hayes, released in 1968. That failed to find an audience, but in 1969 came the more provocatively titled Hot Buttered Soul. Containing just four tracks, it sold more than a million copies.</p> <p>After Shaft and the follow-up Black Moses, he was not to release another major seller, although he had several minor hits as the disco movement emerged. His soundtrack to the Shaft sequel included Zeke the Freak, a song that gained a new lease of life with the house music movement in the UK.</p> <p>Hayes also pursued an acting career, with cameos in several movies including Escape from New York, Robin Hood: Men in Tights and the blaxploitation spoof I'm Gonna Git You Sucka.</p> <p>In the 1990s Hayes reached a new generation as Chef. Two years ago, however, he left the show after an episode that he felt made fun of the Scientology movement, of which he was a member.</p> <p>\"There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins,\" he said.</p> <p>There was subsequent dispute about the origin of the statement. Hayes suffered a stroke in early 2006, and it has been reported that this was the reason he left the show.</p> <p>An appearance on a TV talk show in April this year appeared to suggest that Hayes was suffering from the side-effects of a stroke.</p> <p>However, he continued to lead an active life, spearheading a campaign for the Memphis Heart Clinic which was due to start on Friday.</p> <p>He established the Isaac Hayes Foundation in 1993 to do philanthropic work in Africa, and was subsequently crowned king of a small community in Ghana.</p> <p>A businessman who owned two restaurants and wrote a best-selling cook book, Hayes was married four times and had 12 children.</p>",
  "<p>Cyclist Nicole Cooke broke the British team's Beijing medal drought in style today, overcoming a world-class field and pouring rain to win gold in the women's road race.</p> <p>Racing in the shadow of the Great Wall on the day that the rain that has threatened Beijing all weekend finally arrived, Cooke, born in Wick in the Vale of Glamorgan, out-sprinted three rivals at the end of the 126km race, crossing the line with a roar to secure a gold medal that was significant in every way.</p> <p>It was the first ever medal from a British female cyclist, the first gold from a Welsh athlete since 1972, and Great Britain's 200th gold medal in Olympic history.</p> <p>\"It's just like a dream come true, and I hope everyone one can share in this dream,\" said a jubilant Cooke as she celebrated on the wall at Badaling outside the city. \"There have been so many people helped me to get here since I started cycling, everyone should share in it hope they have the same feelings I do. I still don't think its sunk in yet, I feel like the normal Nicole from before the race. It's just so exciting.</p> <p>\"When I came over the line I was just so happy, so many emotions were coming out that I probably wasn't composed enough to take my hands off the bars and do a salute. I made so much noise because that is the person I am.\"</p> <p>Cooke finished the 126km course in a time of 3hr 32min 24sec beating Sweden's Emma Johansson and Italy's Tatiana Guderza into the medal positions. Fellow Briton Emma Pooley, who helped fragment the field and tire some of Cooke's main rivals, finished in 23rd place, 30 seconds behind Cooke. Sharon Laws, who also spent a large proportion of the race at the front of the peloton, finished 35th.</p> <p>Cooke, who came fifth in the Athens Olympic race, has been the outstanding female road cyclist for the last three years, during which time she has won the women's Tour de France and been ranked No1 in the world. After winning the tour in 2006 she was shortlisted for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award and today she has been installed as 16-1 favourite for the award.</p> <p>Cooke was introduced to competitive cycling aged 11 by her father, a physics teacher who had competed himself at amateur level, and she spent her formative years riding in the Welsh valleys and competing in cyclo-cross, experiences that served her well today as the heavens opened over Beijing. \"I felt like I was drowning more or less, but one of benefits of riding mountain biking and cyclo-cross is that you get used to riding in any conditions,\" she said.</p> <p>Cooke got her first taste of international competition aged 12 when she competed in a stage race in Holland against 60 competitors from across Europe. Her talent was immediately apparent and she was convinced that she had found her vocation. By the time she was 15 her schooling was being rearranged to allow her to train more often, and she took her GCSEs and A-levels early. She won her first junior national title aged 16 and was four-times world junior champion before turning professional.</p> <p>The result delivered a timely boost to Team GB after a quiet start to the games saw medal hopes in judo and archery go unfulfilled, and it was welcomed by sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe: \"This is a great start to the Beijing Olympics for Team GB and I have no doubt this medal will fire up the rest of the team to do their best in the next two weeks. Well done to Nicole Cooke - she has set us on our way.\"</p>"
