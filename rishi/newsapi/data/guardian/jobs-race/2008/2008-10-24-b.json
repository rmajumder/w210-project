  "<p><strong>Glitter Pencil</strong> in black, \u00a314, <br>by Nars, 0870 837 7377 <br>Chunky black crayon with subtle gold glitter that is ideal for smooth kohl line a la 1960s diva. Glitch-free and much easier to apply than liquid eyeliner or black eye shadow, which is prone to smudging. Great party season accessory. <br>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 </p> <p><strong>Gloss Pur Black</strong>, \u00a317.50, <br>by YSL, 01444 255700 <br>Looks scary, and that's before you put it on your lips. Sticky, tar-black gloss that is reassuringly sheer. Build up for full gothic effect; one light coat and your lips look a glamorous plum shade, one more and you're Marilyn Manson. <br>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 </p> <p><strong>Ombre Stretch eye shadow</strong>, <br>\u00a35.95, by Bourjois, 0800 269836 <br>Contains 'nylon microspheres' to make colour 'stretch like fabric across one's lids'. Fantastical sells aside, this is a flattering shade of slate grey which blends well. Not remotely stretchy, but good value anyway. <br>\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606 </p> <p><strong>Smoky Eyes</strong>, \u00a332, by Chanel, <br>020-7493 3836 <br>Four shimmery, smoky shades for winter's key monochrome look.

Perfect. <br>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 </p> <p><strong>London Nights</strong>, pounds 10.50, by Nails Inc, 020-7499 8333 <br>Where better to channel this season's vampy black than on to your nails, as opposed to your lips?

  "<p>The pound is falling at its fastest rate since the ERM debacle in 1992 after it was officially confirmed today that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/24/economicgrowth-recession\">the UK economy is shrinking faster than feared</a>.</p> <p>Sterling plunged by almost 10 cents against the dollar to a low of $1.5270, its lowest level since August 2002, after the Office for National Statistics reported that UK GDP fell by 0.5% in the third quarter of the year. It also dropped sharply against the euro, slipping to \u20ac1.22 from \u20ac1.256 overnight, and hit a 12-year low against a broad basket of other currencies.</p> <p>As recently as July the pound was trading above $2, but it has now shed more than 25% of its value against the dollar, as investors abandon the currency in anticipation that the UK will be a major casualty of the global downturn.</p> <p>Analysts said that the pound was falling at its fastest rate since 1992, when the UK toppled out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.</p> <p>\"Risk-averse investors are abandoning the lame-duck pound for the lower-risk US dollar, and in particular US Treasury Bonds. The implications of this for a country so heavily reliant on its imports as the UK may be severe,\" said Piers Cracknell, commercial director of Moneycorp.</p> <p>Cracknell said that the cost of importing goods from the US and the far east have rocketed this week. \"There is no doubt that these costs will be passed on into the high street, he warned.</p> <p>Today's decline came as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/24/marketturmoil-creditcrunch1\">stockmarkets worldwide fell sharply</a>, driven down by growing fears of a world recession. In London the FTSE 100 fell by 9% after the GDP numbers were released. This followed turmoil in Asia where markets tumbled by over 10% overnight, as gloomy forecasts from Sony and Samsung sent their shares plunging by as much as 14%.</p> <p>Amid the wild swings on the currency markets this morning the yen hit a 13-year high against the US dollar and gained 4% against the euro, bringing new pain to Japanese exporters.</p> <p>The fall in sterling should give a boost to Britain's struggling exporters, as it makes their goods cheaper abroad. But it pushes up the cost of imports at a time when retailers are already suffering as consumers cut back, and also makes a foreign holiday more expensive.</p> <p>Sterling had already <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/22/pound-recession-interest-rates\">shed 7 cents on Wednesday</a> after Mervyn King admitted for the first time that the UK is probably entering recession. The shock fall in GDP compounded fears that the slowdown could be deeper and longer than analysts thought.</p> <p><strong>Greenspan: I was wrong</strong></p> <p>The inquest into the global economic crisis has already begun. Yesterday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/24/economics-creditcrunch-federal-reserve-greenspan\">Alan Greenspan</a> admitted that mistakes were made in deregulating the financial markets.</p> <p>The former Federal Reserve chairman admitted to a congressional committee that he had been \"partially wrong\" in his hands-off approach towards the banking industry and that the credit crunch had left him in a state of shocked disbelief. </p> <p>\"I have found a flaw,\" said Greenspan, referring to his economic philosophy. \"I don't know how significant or permanent it is. But I have been very distressed by that fact.\"</p>"
