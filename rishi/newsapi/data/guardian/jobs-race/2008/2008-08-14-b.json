  "<p>\"I tell lies. Not, like, proper lies, just little lies. I started telling 'em - jokes, I should call them - when I was very young. I've always had a sense of humour, but people haven't always shared it.\" Solange Knowles opens her almond-shaped eyes wide. \"The problem,\" she continues, \"is that my tone is very dry, so people never know when I don't mean things. When I was younger, I used to have more of a chirpy delivery, but I don't have the energy for that shit no more.\"</p> <p>Energy does not at first seem to be a quality she possesses in abundance - she slouches into the room, half an hour late, wearing just a pink negligee, and for the most part acts as if she has just been dragged from her bed. That is a red herring. Later in the day, showcasing her new album Sol-Angel and the Hadley St Dreams at the Notting Hill Arts Club, Solange performs with demented glee: nailing her frenetic choreography, climbing on the speaker stacks, bobbing and weaving among the audience.</p> <p>Her restless, inquisitive character is confirmed by her music. Sol-Angel is an eccentric mix of 60s Motown throwbacks and cut-and-pasted electronica (\"I wanted it to be like a journey through time,\" she says). On her equally offbeat MySpace blog, Solange says: \"I want to be like the black Bj\u00f6rk!\" and declares that her new year's resolution is to \"use my middle finger a lot more. I always think, what person did that gesture and made it so famous for saying, 'Fuck you!' Why wasn't it a pinky or a thumb?\" In person, her conversation is elliptical and punctuated with long pauses even when she warms up. \"People think I'm high, even when I'm sober,\" she says. \"You probably think I'm high right now.\"</p> <p>That kind of public communique is, perhaps, surprising given Solange's background: she is the little sister of Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles. Given Beyonc\u00e9's public commitment to moral rectitude, one wouldn't expect her sister to be a divorced mother of one who sings about sex and weed (ChampagneChronicNightcap) and who has tattoos on her wrists (\"They mean that when one life goes, one life comes. One of my friends passed away - and the next thing I knew, I was pregnant. So I was just having lots of thoughts about reincarnation\"). Not that she's willing to talk about her relationship with her sister, and how it might have affected her music. \"I don't find that interesting. At all,\" she says.</p> <p>What is she interested in? Visual art, the history of prostitution in Chicago, and architecture. \"I'm always thinking, if I make a lot of money one day, it'd be ideal to have one of the sketches in my brain built. By the way, I just wanna say: that building in Dubai? The one where every floor rotates? I had a nightmare about it, that everyone ... yeah, I can't share that. Dubai's a pretty powerful place. They might not let me in. But it was definitely not a good dream.\" Does she want to go there? \"Only if I can have sex on the beach. Hang on! That was a joke. Include that. Put L-O-L. Anyway, I really love lofts.There are a lot of historical lofts in Houston and it's amazing for me that a lot of them were built in the 1920s. I love the exposed bricks and the very industrial stuff. They're not so much like the buildings in Dubai.\"</p> <p>Solange's conversational obliqueness also seems like a defence mechanism. Probing too deeply leads to vagueness or flippancy: questions about her time in Idaho, where she lived with her ex-husband for two years, are batted away with the response, \"I loved potatoes. And then I left them behind, because I left the potato man.\" Later, she snaps, \"I think people focus too much energy on getting people to like them, trying to get people to accept them. I've never felt any validation from that.\"</p> <p>Describing what she was like as a child, though, Solange finally provides a clue to her character: \"I was ridiculous and crazy and sporadic. I was just in my own little world. I still am.\"</p>",
  "<p>The rapidly changing face of the American people is revealed in new census projections that predict that groups that are now labelled minorities will form the greater part of the country's population by 2042.</p> <p>According to the US census bureau, the dominance of non-Hispanic white people, who today account for two-thirds of Americans, will be whittled away, falling steadily to less than half in 2042 and 46% by 2050. In the opposite trajectory, those who describe themselves as Hispanic, black, Asian and Native American will increase in proportion from about a third now to 54% by 2050.</p> <p>Such a rapid demographical shift is in tune with trends that have been seen for some time, but it is happening much faster than experts had predicted even four years ago.</p> <p>Demographers see it as among the most intensive changes of a country's racial and ethnic make-up in history, every bit as dramatic as the huge influx of Italian, Irish and east European immigrants that transformed the US in the early 20th century.</p> <p>\"The new projections move up some of the changes that are happening. The minority population now will become the majority eight or nine years earlier than we had thought,\" said David Waddington, who heads the census bureau's population projections team.</p> <p>The shift in majority status from non-Hispanic whites, who have enjoyed the dominant position since European settlers from England, the Netherlands and elsewhere overtook the Spanish and Native American population centuries ago, is likely to have profound implications. In the long term, it could prompt a sea-change in the country's understanding of its politics and culture. More immediately, it is likely to inform debates on immigration policy and reshape the electoral landscape.</p> <p>Two underlying factors are strongly at play in the new projections. The first is that the overall population of the country is growing faster than expected. It passed the 300 million-mark in October 2006, and is projected to cross the 400 million landmark by 2039. By 2050 it will reach 439 million.</p> <p>That extraordinary rate of growth is in turn fuelling the second main underlying factor, which is the huge increase in the US Hispanic population. In the census bureau definition, Hispanic refers to a person's description of their origin in places such as Mexico or South America, rather than their race.</p> <p>The projections suggest that the Hispanic population will increase from 15% of the population today to almost a third by 2050, almost tripling in size from 47 million to 133 million. By contrast, the non-Hispanic white population is expected to remain relatively steady numerically, barely rising from 200 million to 203 million. For the first time in US history, the white population will lose numbers between 2030 and 2040.</p> <p>Of the other main groups, the black population is projected to remain relatively stable in proportional terms, rising from 14% of the population today to 15% in 2050, from 41 million to 66 million.</p> <p>The Asian population is projected to climb more sharply, from 16 million, or 5%, to 41 million, or 9%.</p> <p>The impact of the changes is likely to be further magnified by the seismic change in the country's age profile that will occur simultaneously. As the baby-boomer generation passes into older age it is causing an extreme bulge, like the shape of a snake's torso after eating a rabbit. Over-65s are 12% of the US population this year, but by 2050 they will comprise one in five Americans.</p> <p>Cross-tabulate those figures with the racial and ethnic composition of the nation and the results are even more striking. The growth in minority groups is heavily focused on younger age groups. They already account for 45% of American children under 18, and that proportion will rise to 62% by 2050.</p> <p>\"It means there's going to be a young-old divide,\" said William Frey, a demographer at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. Frey points out that young adults aged 18 to 29 are already the most ethnically and racially diverse, and as a group have tended to back Barack Obama in this year's election. By the presidential election of 2028, Hispanic, black and Asian people will be in the majority within that age range.</p> <p>\"But the over-65s will primarily remain white and will stay that way. The challenge for any national politician will be appealing to such diverse interests at both ends of the spectrum.\"</p> <p>The census bureau points out that its projections are based on assumptions about future births, deaths, immigration from abroad and internal migration that it has extrapolated from trends over the past 20 years. Those factors could change, particularly the rate of immigration, which is already a matter of heated debate across the country.</p>",

  "<p>Students faced the toughest ever scramble for university places today as record numbers achieved straight As and the pass rate rose to 97% for the first time.</p> <p>Meanwhile, thousands of students already at university were being paid to answer calls from applicants who had missed their grades and hoped to get on a course, and from others who could not believe their luck and were phoning to check they really did have a place. </p> <p>At Kingston University 64 students were manning the phones - almost double the number drafted in to do the job last year.</p> <p>They were expecting to take 20,000 calls today and tomorrow - 1,000 every hour. By 11.30am today, students had taken nearly 2,300 calls. </p> <p>\"I've got a caller for pharmacology. Would you like his Ucas number?\" Verere Oyearone, 18, a second year pharmaceutical sciences student at Kingston, asks an admissions tutor on the other line. This is Oyearone's seventh call in the last hour.</p> <p><br>Some 800 places out of a total of 6,000 are up for grabs through Clearing at Kingston this year - a similar figure to last year, professor Martyn Jones, Kingston's pro-vice-chancellor for external relations says.</p> <p>This year the calibre of applicants is higher than ever. The proportion of A-levels awarded an A is expected to rise above the 25.3% it was last year. In 1990 it was 12%.</p> <p>\"There have been lots of Bs, Cs and Ds. No Es so far,\" says Oyearone. </p> <p>In fact, at the Kingston Clearing centre, those taking the calls are noticing that many students have achieved better grades than they expected and are trying to break the contract with what was their top choice university and go elsewhere.</p> <p>That can put universities in a difficult situation, not knowing how many places they have spare.</p> <p>\"A lot of people are ringing to change their courses because their results are better,\" says Nick Bhugeloo, operations manager of applicant services at Kingston. \"That's happening more this year than last. We want to do the right thing by them and try to help. It might mean they are now qualified to apply for a three-year degree, rather than the foundation degree they originally applied for.\"</p> <p>Jones says about 10% of students seem to be doing better than they expected. \"If you think that the process of applying to university started before Christmas, you can see that a lot can happen in that time. We have to be realistic about students who break their contracts with what was their top choice university. No university wants a student who wants to be somewhere else.\"</p> <p>But there are still students disappointed to have missed their grades. An estimated 50,000 out of the 300,000 who received their grades across the country today will go into Clearing.</p> <p>\"Don't worry, it'll all be fine,\" says Shiri Rajput, 20, a second-year law student, to one distraught caller. This is Rajput's 15th call since the hotline opened at 8.30am.</p> <p>\"There was one who was so upset she couldn't speak,\" says Oyearone. \"I try to calm them down and to tell them that everything is going to be fine. This is not the end of the world.\"</p> <p>\"Their voices can go very quiet if they are very panicky,\" says Rajput. </p> <p>This morning, Kingston had places on computing, science and business degrees available through Clearing.</p> <p>Arts, drama and history places were the most sought-after.*</p> <p>\"We are seeing many more well-informed applicants this year,\" says Jones. \"They ask more about the career paths that the degrees will lead to and the 'soft skills' they'll gain than they did years ago. We have very thoughtful discussions with many of them.\"</p> <p>It's a long 10-hour shift for Rajput and Oyearone. \"But it's nice to have helped someone find a place when they start off upset,\" says Rajput.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday September 22 2008 to remove a reference to places on fashion courses going quickly in clearing.</p>",
  "<p>The British Cycling performance director Dave Brailsford believes that Nicole Cooke's coolly taken gold medal in the women's Olympic road race championship could add impeutus to his plan to set up a British men's professional road race team using the same methods that have brought gold medals on the track and now Cooke's gold on the road.</p> <p>\"It raised a lot of eyebrows when we set up the Halfords team, the ProNat squad, getting Nicole to base her whole year around one race to try and integrate some of the great things that have been developed and nurtured on the track and try and get them to cross-fertilize into other bits of the sport,\" said Brailsford.</p> <p>This season, Cooke has been part of a professional squad sponsored by Halfords run under the aegis of Brailsford's Olympic team, which is seen as a possible model for the proposed men's team. \"It hasn't been easy but overall it shows that with good planning, good people and the right attitude success can be achieved in a different discipline,\" said Brailsford. \"If we approach things in a certain way, it optimises people's chances of success. So far it's just reconfirmed that what we do on the track can be done in other areas. Maybe it's given me even greater conviction to think that we're only scratching the surface. You can point at these results and say 'this is what we can do'.\"</p> <p>Cooke's gold on Sunday was the first win in an Olympic or senior world championship road race for a Briton since lottery funding started in 1998 and marks a sea-change, says Brailsford.</p> <p>\"We're more confident now in being able to plan to win big events rather than merely dreaming. You can say there is a realistic chance and you can set about it. I'd like to give credit to our coaches. [Team psychiatrist] Steve Peters gets a lot of credit and so do the riders but the coaches are doing the day-in day out stuff and that makes the difference.\"</p>"
