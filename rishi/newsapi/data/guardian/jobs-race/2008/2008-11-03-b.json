Black used to play guitar with, and write most of the songs for, indie band the Servant (not to be confused with Luke Haines of the Auteurs' first band, the Servants), whose music featured in trailers for the film Sin City and who released an album in 2006 called How to Destroy a Relationship. We could have saved him the time and told him ourselves. Black's distinctive vocals were also used on records by an Italian outfit called Planet Funk and have been likened to those of \"a young Liam Gallagher if he'd been raised by Quentin Crisp\", which surely means he's got a voice like a camp football thug. He doesn't, but we sort of know what they were driving at: he sounds simultaneously sensitive yet strident, lispy and surly. <br> The schizoid-impulse thing is proving to be his calling card: Black cites his two influences on his MySpace as Jay-Z and Sigur Ros, and although we know he's being artful, his cover version of Notorious BIG's HPNTZ, released earlier this year as a limited-edition seven-inch single, was a piece of chillaxed rapmospherica that managed to be both soothing and sinister. A one-time Zane Lowe Hottest Track In the World, it featured Black's yearning vocals over a mash-up of Rihanna's Umbrella beat and some sweeping strings from John Carpenter's film Starman and sounded a bit like The Verve's Bittersweet Symphony being tickled in a back alley by Mike Skinner. No wonder it \"blew up\" \"big style\" on the \"blogosphere\" and made Perez Hilton behave like Paris Hilton. </p> <p>His forthcoming debut single proper, Yours, is a Prince-ly slice of future-funk with a staccato beat, minimalist bassline and swirly electro FX as well as an independence-declaring lyric (\"Don't want to be yours no more\") that makes it a sort of I Will Survive for Hoxton trendy-boys. It's accompanied by a gaudily playful video, apparently made for \"zero pence\" and directed by hip Parisians Chic Et Ertistic, while Black was on holiday in Lombok, Bali, Hong Kong and Paris. If this is what he can do while he's on holiday, god knows what he can do when he's at work. <br> <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"He's going to be a massive star in 2009.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> Yes, he's going to be a gigantic, luminous ball of plasma next year. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Light up the night sky. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Affect the Hadron Collider. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Yours is released by A&amp;M on December 1, with the debut album to follow in early 2009.<br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Tom Vek, Calvin Harris, Jamie T, Jamie Lidell. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/danblacksound\">www.myspace.com/danblacksound</a> </p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Deadfisch.</p>"
