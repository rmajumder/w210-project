  "<p>It's not actually advertised as Britain's most difficult job, but I can't imagine there are many tougher ones on offer at the moment.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.wmann.com/opportunities/opportunity_pop_up.asp?id=516&amp;wmann=\">As advertised</a> on the front page of today's <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/newspapers/sunday_times/?days=Sunday\">Sunday Times</a> job pages: wanted, a new Bank of England deputy governor with particular responsibility for financial stability. <br><br>The successful applicant will replace the current incumbent, career civil servant <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/people/biographies/gieve.htm\">Sir John Gieve</a>, <a href=\"http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article4170009.ece\">whose departure</a> only part-way through the normal five year term was announced in June. His future had been called into question after he was criticised over the handling of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/northernrock\">Northern Rock</a> crisis.</p> <p>Interested in replacing him? Recruitment consultants <a href=\"http://www.wmann.com/\">Whitehead Mann</a> warn that you must possess \"extensive knowledge and experience of financial markets, and be well versed in economic issues\".</p> <p>It adds, with only slight understatement:</p> <blockquote> <p>This is a high profile and influential role at a time of significant change in financial markets.</p> </blockquote> <p>In return, you get a salary of around \u00a3240,000 plus a spot on the bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee. Oh yes, and you get to boast that you were officially appointed by the Queen, although of course she's unlikely to be interviewing you in person \u2013 she acts on the advice of Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling.</p> <p>Tough, yes. But at least it means working for a bank that \u2013 for now \u2013 is unlikely to go under.</p>"
