  "<p>Mike Ashley has revealed that Newcastle United still owe \u00a327m in outstanding payments on transfer deals completed before the billionaire owner of Sports Direct bought the club last summer. In a rare interview \u2014 with a new, official club magazine \u2014 Ashley admits that he did not perform due diligence before buying Newcastle from the Hall family but suggests that, without his input, the club could now be in a serious financial plight.</p> <p>\"Financially, Newcastle United was in a difficult positon because I really do think that it had over-extended itself,\" he said. \"We first heard about the potential sale on a Saturday and had the deal done by the Wednesday, so if you are asking if we did due diligence before buying, then the answer has to be no.</p> <p>\"One of the most unfortunate things about Newcastle United's finances at that time was the amount of money still owed on players signed in comparison to the amount of income that was due in off players who had gone.</p> <p>\"There is still \u00a327m net to pay on transfers that were done before I came. So probably in the latter years before we came in you could argue that the club was beginning to lose its way. It had also already taken upfront payments from commerical deals and sponsorships which didn't help us at all. It seemed as though the club was in a very downward sprial, one it would have found very hard to come out of.\"</p> <p>This perhaps explains Ashley's apparent reluctance to invest heavily in the transfer market this summer but he stressed that he has not been exactly slow to put his hand in his pocket.</p> <p>\"Apart from the purchase of the club and the associated costs that come with that, I've put in a further \u00a3100m to reduce debts, yet we still have the outstanding debt of the monies still owed on player transfers,\" he explained.</p> <p>Even so when Ashley, who insists he is not looking to sell Newcastle, was asked if he regretted the purchase he replied: \"Absolutely not\" and described the clubs as \"one of the jewels, one of the diamonds of the Premier League.\"</p> <p>Insisting that his habit of wearing black and white replica shirts and sitting with fans at away games is \"not a gimmick\", Newcastle's owner said: \"I wear my strip and go in with the fans because that's how I've always gone to football and I enjoy it. Nothing beats the atmosphere of being in with the fans....it's tremendous to be part of.</p> <p>\"I feel like they do. I'm in with the fans and if we are not playing well I'm thinking to myself: 'How can this be? We are Newcastle United and we should be doing better than this.'\"</p> <p>Having described his decision to make Kevin Keegan the team's manager in January as \"a no brainer\" Ashley then addressed the vexed issue of Keegan's often tense relationship with Dennis Wise, Newcastle's executive director (football). \"Kevin is a great manager and he is happiest working with the players,\" said Ashley. \"But there's so much involved in running a club that you must make sure people aren't spread too thinly. How could Kevin devote all his time to the first team if he also had to look after the academy? That's where Dennis Wise comes in.\"</p> <p>Keegan is more concerned about Wise's say in transfer dealings but will be hoping that the club finally manage to complete the protracted \u00a310m transfer of Fabricio Coloccini, the Argentina defender, from Deportivo La Coruna today.</p> <p>Meanwhile Roy Keane has renewed his attempt to bring Leighton Baines to Sunderland. Keane is prepared to offer Everton \u00a36m for the former England Under-21 interantional left back. Last summer Sunderland's manager saw four bids for the then Wigan player fail before Baines finally moved to Goodison Park for \u00a36m.</p>",
  "<p><br>Duty free ... Terry Wogan with Scooch, the UK's 2007 Eurovision entry. Photograph: Todd Antony/BBC</p> <p>Some shows are just synonymous with their presenter. Only fools and revisionists recognise the post-John Craven newsround; the true Countdown will always be fronted by Richard Whiteley; and Sir Michael Terence Wogan <em>is</em> the Eurovision Song contest. Or was. Sir Terry is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/12/bbc.radio\">stepping down</a> from the helm of the BBC Eurovision coverage in a move certain to horrify hardcore fans.</p> <p>Effortlessly witty and charming, Wogan was the first Eurovision commentator to credit viewers with intelligence and openly mock the block-voting charade, seeing it for the infinitely entertaining farce it is. Sardonic without being snide, Wogan was always on hand to offer the benefit of his wisdom to the contest participants (his advice to Sweden's returning officer <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8tuRKUlUS4\">Bj\u00f6rn Gustafsson</a> - \"It's not easy this, you have to move your lips\" - being a particular favourite).</p> <p>But with Wogan gone, will anyone bother watching the show? Is Eurovision finally facing its <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGs7dTjUsXw\">Waterloo</a>? Well, let's not write the obituaries just yet. Yes, the king is dead, but there must be candidates to replace him; so just who is available to commentate on the only pan-European vote that means a damn thing?</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDBPlB7ObMM\">Carol Vorderman</a></strong><br>At a loose end and desperate to appear on whatever show will have her, Vorderman has the profile but neither the wit nor the talent to step into Wogan's impressive size 12s. Sorry Carol, Strictly Come Dancing will be up for renewal in five years - try that.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Nul points. Carol returns to Countdown, tail between legs, on the minimum wage.</p> <p><strong>Davina McCall</strong><br>The reigning queen of Big Brother likes fronting big, iconic shows, likes the limelight, and likes people - but do people still like her? Big Brother forums reveal increasing boredom with her sycophantic interview style and love of referring to bullying dullards as \"genius housemates\".</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Deux points. Davina sticks to increasingly bizarre <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yklJOLOlmUs\">L'Oreal adverts</a> and ousts <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uioVPmHUpE\">Holly Willoughby</a> as host of Streetmate.</p> <p><strong>Ant and Dec</strong><br>Watch them rock the Eurovision mic? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_sJmIQrH54\">PSYCHE!</a> While witty, lovable and untouchable in their preferred format the boys lack the spontaneity to be effective over the long haul of the voting marathon.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Cinq points. PJ and pal fall short of landing the gig but the Eurovision flotation allows them the leverage to squeeze another obscene pay rise out of ITV.</p> <p><strong>Simon Amstell:</strong><br>Amstell's pedigree on Popworld and Never Mind the Buzzcocks shows he has the necessary love of pop music combined with a healthy irreverence for its performers. Not many presenters could have prevented <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihFzr8QPfOg&amp;feature=related\">Amy Winehouse's Buzzcocks appearance</a> turning into a bloodbath, but Amstell brilliantly piloted the tail-spinning chanteuse out of harm's way, playing on their shared Jewish heritage and past Popworld hook-ups, for a rocky but ultimately safe landing. He's witty with or without a script and would relish the challenge of becoming the next Mr Eurovision.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Dix points! Amstell is a massive hit with the viewers as he chides production values, rails against corrupt Eastern Bloc voting and editorialises on the need for a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCY-a5tNDw\">Blue Mercedes</a> reunion.</p> <p>It's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ0xlCXJimM\">making your mind up</a> time, folks. Who's your fantasy Eurovision commentator? Is Wogan replaceable, or should we just cut our losses, jettison the coverage and become the full-time Europhobes we secretly wanted to be all along?</p>",
  "<p>Johnston Press is planning to close two Scottish free weekly newspapers and look to cut costs further in its local newspaper business - placing 15 jobs at risk.</p> <p>The publisher is proposing to cease publication of the Glasgow East News and the Ayrshire Extra and also \"reorganise\" its distribution, administration and telesales departments at its Academy Park offices in Glasgow.</p> <p>In the past two weeks Johnston Press has unveiled a range of cost-cutting measures across its 300 UK regional and local newspapers.</p> <p>Closure of the Ayr office is believed to affect nine staff, with a further two employees affected by the Glasgow East News ceasing production.</p> <p>The other jobs under threat are believed to be support roles at Academy Park, home of Johnston Press publication the Glasgow South &amp; Eastwood Extra.</p> <p>It is not yet known how many of the proposed job losses will be from editorial.</p> <p>Johnston Press confirmed the planned Scottish closures and the \"reorganisation\" of backroom staff, saying the company had entered into consultation with those who may be affected.</p> <p>It is understood that three or four journalist jobs could be affected by Johnston Press's decision to cease publication of the Glasgow East News and the Ayrshire Extra.</p> <p>Officials from the National Union of Journalists met with management from Johnston Press yesterday.</p> <p>The union and management are scheduled to meet again tomorrow to discuss NUJ proposals for redeployment of the journalistic staff and a further union proposal for keeping the Ayrshire Extra newspaper in print.</p> <p>The company was one of three UK regional newspaper groups to have net profit forecasts for the next three years downgraded in July by investment bank Citigroup, which cited the downturn in local advertising as the catalyst.</p> <p>Along with Trinity Mirror and Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, Citigroup downgraded net profit forecasts for Johnston Press by 14.2% this year, 11.6% next year and 18.8% in 2010.</p> <p>In the weeks following that announcement, Johnston Press has undertaken several cost-saving measures and rumours persist in the industry that further cuts to its Scottish weekly newspaper operation are expected soon.</p> <p>Last week it emerged that management at the Johnston Press-owned Sheffield Star planned to make five compulsory redundancies and look for a string of voluntary redundancies.</p> <p>Johnston Press also revealed on Tuesday, August 5, that it was planning a round of cost-cutting at its Edinburgh-based Scotsman Publications, publisher of titles including the Scotsman, Edinburgh Evening News and Scotland on Sunday, placing 30 jobs at risk.</p> <p>On Monday, August 4, Johnston Press confirmed plans to close the London sales office of its recruitment website Jobstoday.co.uk, placing eight jobs at risk.</p> <p>On August 1, it was announced that the Johnston Press-owned Northants Evening Telegraph and Northampton Chronicle &amp; Echo would switch from evening to morning publication and close their local printing operations.</p> <p>Johnston Press said six positions were at risk as a result of the changes to the two papers, but reports suggest up to 70 printing jobs could also be affected by the closure of the company's Northampton presses as the papers' overnight printing is switched to Peterborough.</p> <p>These closures, job losses and financial adjustments follow Johnston Press's completion, in June, of a deeply discounted rights issue, securing \u00a3170m with which to deal with the downturn in advertising revenue across more than 300 regional and local paper titles it publishes.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.
