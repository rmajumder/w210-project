  "<p>Anyone who keeps an eye on women's progress towards full equality will be well aware that the gains tend to be incremental - an inch here, a small step there - enough to keep a feminist motivated, while inwardly broiling with impatience. What no one expects is for the wheels to squeal suddenly and start spinning in reverse. But yesterday the publication of the Equality and Human Rights Commission's report, Sex and Power 2008, showed that when it comes to landing top jobs, women's progress seems to be falling away. </p> <p>The report examined 25 different fields of work, and found that in 12 of them the number of women holding top posts has decreased in the past year. So, for instance, the proportion of female MPs has fallen from 19.5% of the total to 19.3%, while the proportion of female cabinet ministers has declined sharply from 34.8% to 26.1%. Women make up just 25% of heads of professional bodies compared with 33.3% the year before, and the number of female editors of national newspapers (including the Glasgow Herald and Western Mail) has declined from 17.4% to 13.6%. In five other categories, the report found that the number of women at the top has stalled, while there has been a forward movement in just eight. And though this last result suggests that we have some reason to cheer, the increases are hardly the stuff of party hats and streamers. As the report points out, \"in six of these eight categories, the proportion of women doing these top jobs has increased by less than one percentage point - which, while welcome, is a tiny change\". </p> <p>The findings raise the question: why is this happening now? Indeed, how can it be happening now? In many ways the timing seems strange - we're apparently living in an era of great progressive values, and there's no doubt that when it comes to achievement at school and university, women are doing well. A 2007 report by the Office of National Statistics found that girls are outperforming boys at all levels of education; in 2006, 54% of those entering undergraduate courses were women. And, as those achievements suggest, young women are ambitious. A 2004 survey of year 10 pupils found that 88% of girls - and 86% of boys - considered choosing a career with long-term prospects to be very important; a survey a few years later found that 90% of boys and girls looked forward to balancing a career with family life.</p> <p>But the fact is that the work culture was never designed for or by women - and recently it has become even more antagonistic to family life. As Katherine Rake, director of the UK's largest equality organisation, the Fawcett Society, points out, while more than four million extra women have entered work since the feminist revolution of the 1970s (there are now 14.3 million women in the workforce, compared with 16.9 million men), the employment culture has changed very little since a much earlier revolution - the industrial one of the 18th century. The workplace was originally set up for a cultural model that involved men working all hours, while women tended the home, and it has largely stayed that way. There's still an expectation that top employees will work very long hours (which preclude much time spent on childcare or other caring responsibilities), and there's a stigma attached to part-time work, which means it's much less likely to be either well-paid or well-regarded. With women still doing the lion's share of chores in the home, this culture can make it difficult to combine work and family. </p> <p>And in recent years it has become worse than ever. In 2008, the UK government renewed its opt-out of the EU working time directive, which would have limited British workers to a 48-hour week - under British regulations, workers can toil for up to 60 hours a week, worked out as an average across three months (meaning that they can pack even more hours into a working week, if necessary, so long as it balances out). And this opt-out is evidence of a broader social attitude, which increasingly regards long hours as essential to success. According to Madeleine Bunting's book, Willing Slaves, only 44% of workers use up their full entitlement to annual leave; a study conducted by the Work Foundation found that 73% of full-time workers would like to spend more time with their families.</p> <p>The shift to increasingly long hours is therefore one factor that is hurting women's progress. Rake thinks another factor might, rather counter-intuitively, be women's recent successes. \"One of the interesting things,\" she says, \"is that at a lot of organisations, the number of women at the top often hovers around a third, and then stalls. I think there is this assumption that if you've got a third of women in an organisation, then somehow they are just everywhere and they're dominating the organisation and it's all a bit too much.\" </p> <p>Call it the Jeremy Paxman effect. Last month, the Newsnight presenter followed up his searing critique of Marks &amp; Spencer's gussets with the contention that \"the worst thing that you can be in the [television] industry is a middle-class white male. If any middle-class white male I come across says he wants to enter television, I say 'give up all hope'. They've no chance.\" </p> <p>It's an interesting perspective - and clearly the cry of a man who feels under siege. But this analysis exists at some distance from reality. Despite the strength of Paxman's paranoia, women hold only 10 of the 35 most senior positions at the BBC, and make up just four of the 15-strong executive board. There has never been a female director-general. When it comes to the media as a whole, the EHRC report finds that women comprise only 10.5% of chief executives of media companies in the FTSE 350.</p> <p>But it's not about the facts; it's about perception. And, as Rake says, in some cases it seems that once women have reached a certain level of visibility in a company, a complacency (even sometimes a hostility) to our presence sets in. There then follows the possibility that any programmes in place to encourage women into management, or, say, to help workers in general with job flexibility, are more likely to lapse.</p> <p>There are other signs that cultural antipathy to women in the workplace is increasing. Just a month ago, Jacqueline Scott, professor of empirical sociology at Cambridge University, published a report that suggested support for gender equality - and particularly for women who combine work with family - was declining in the UK. Analysing opinion polls, she found that in 1994, 51% of women in Britain and 52% of men said that they believed that family life wouldn't suffer if a woman went to work. By 2002, just 46% of women and 42% of men agreed with that contention. \"While British attitudes are more egalitarian than in the 1980s,\" said Scott, \"there are signs that support for gender equality may have hit a high point some time during the 1990s. When it comes to the clash between work and family life, doubts about whether a woman should be doing both are starting to creep in.\"</p> <p>Another recent shift has been the growing signs that employers perceive women of childbearing age as a liability in the workplace. Earlier this year, Sir Alan Sugar, one of the country's most prominent businessmen, said that as an employer he would like to be able to ask women at interview \"Are you planning to get married and have any children?\", adding that the fact that this was legally prohibited gave businesses an easy option: \"Just don't employ them.\" Last year's Equalities Review, commissioned by the government, found that more than 70% of recruitment agencies had been asked by clients to avoid hiring pregnant women or those of childbearing age - which now takes in everyone from teenagers to fiftysomethings, and thus pretty much covers the whole of a woman's working life. And while these attitudes were already sharp and nasty, the final big recent change regarding women and work has been the extension of maternity leave benefits. Employees who are pregnant or have just given birth are now entitled to 39 weeks statutory maternity pay, regardless of whether or not they intend to return to work; after that, they can also take an extra 13 weeks' leave (although they are not guaranteed any pay for this). </p> <p>Maternity benefits can be great for women trying to combine work and the home, of course, but the fact that this entitlement has jumped so far ahead of paternity benefits (which still stand at just two weeks' leave) has had two effects. One is that it is likely to have made employers even more wary of taking on female staff - as Nicola Brewer, chief executive of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, has said, there is a worry \"that the current legislations and regulations have had the unintended consequence of making women a less attractive prospect to employers\".</p> <p>And perhaps even more perilously and crucially, the extension of these benefits has underlined the idea that women are the ones responsible for children - the message being that women do the caring, not that men and women are equal parents. Of course, the solution would be to convert the one year's maternity leave currently on offer to one year's parental leave, which could be shared between a couple as they saw fit. But, as Rake understands it, under EU regulations, once a benefit is in place for a particular group, it cannot be rolled back. Therefore, the only way to create parity between male and female parental leave would be to grant both men and women up to a year off work. </p> <p>Don't hold your breath. It has only recently dawned on the Labour government what a bad decision this was. One ex-cabinet minister has said, off the record, that when they realised that this was the case, they felt it was the biggest mistake of their political career.</p> <p>When it comes to all the issues that face women in the workplace, says Rake, \"there is no silver bullet, but it's about general labour market transformation. It's about stopping the long hours working culture; mainstreaming flexibility; equal pay audits; setting up parental leave rather than maternity leave. All of those things. The issue is so big that it's not about tinkering with it.\" The system needs full-scale change.</p> <p>Otherwise women's job prospects won't just be moving at a snail's pace, which is how the EHRC report puts it. There will be a new category entirely. Rake calls it \"sub-snail\".</p>",

  "<p>Black Caribbean pupils are being subjected to institutional racism in English schools which can dramatically undermine their chances of academic success, according to a new study. </p> <p>Researchers have uncovered evidence that teachers are routinely under-estimating the abilities of some black pupils, suggesting that assumptions about behavioural problems are overshadowing their academic talents. </p> <p>The findings, based on a survey which tracked 15,000 pupils through their education, add weight to the theory that low achievement among some black students is made worse because teachers don't expect them to succeed. </p> <p>Black education groups welcomed the evidence, calling for urgent measures to be taken to stamp out any covert racism in schools. But other experts said the study was evidence that there needed to be new efforts to tackle behavioural problems among young black Caribbean pupils. </p> <p>The research examined the profile of pupils entered by teachers to take higher-tier papers in their maths and science tests at 14. Pupils can only get top marks by sitting these papers, and the tests influence the range of GCSEs they go on to take.</p> <p>White pupils were significantly more likely to be entered for the top tiers than their black Caribbean, Pakistani, black African and Bangladeshi classmates. </p> <p>Most of the differences were explained by the pupils' previous results or by other factors which might have put them at a disadvantage, such as the level of education reached by their mothers, entitlement to free meals, and truancy and exclusion - all strong predictors of academic success.</p> <p>But for a significant proportion of Black Caribbean pupils, there was no academic explanation for them being excluded from the harder papers. </p> <p>Dr Steve Strand from Warwick University, the author of the study, said: \"After accounting for all measured factors, the under-representation is specific to this one ethnic group and indicates that, all other things being equal, for every three white British pupils entered for the higher tiers, only two black Caribbean pupils are entered.\"</p> <p>He concludes that \"institutional racism\" and low expectations by teachers explain the missing black Caribbean students from top-tier exams.</p> <p>\"By 'institutional racism' I mean organisational arrangements that may have disproportionately negative impacts on some ethnic groups,\" he said. </p> <p>He said other research suggests that teachers' judgment of pupils' academic ability could be warped by behavioural problems. \"It is widely perceived that black Caribbean pupils are more confrontational. The question is, how much is real behavioural problems and how much is a problem between teachers and pupils. </p> <p>\"Teachers might say it is about pupils' behaviour. Black Caribbean parents will say it's teachers prejudicing against their kids. Others say behavioural issues are a response to low expectations from teachers ... To break the cycle, the best policy lever we have is with the teachers.\"</p> <p>Strand's research is based on the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England, managed by the Department for Children, Schools and Families. He will present his findings at the British Educational Research Association's annual conference in Edinburgh today. </p> <p>Beaula McCalla, who runs the Erondu Foundation, for black Caribbean pupils in Bristol, said: \"There is a problem with institutional racism in schools. It's about low expectations of pupils.\" </p> <p>However, others questioned the conclusion. Tony Sewell, an education consultant and columnist for the Voice newspaper, said there is \"a link between behaviour and academic outcome. It doesn't mean that's evidence of institutional racism. It's evidence that we need to address properly the complex reasons why black Caribbean pupils behave badly. We can't just say it's white racist teachers.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for Children, Schools and Families said: \"Since 2003, the percentage increase in the number of black Caribbean pupils achieving five good GCSEs has been almost double the national average, meaning that the gap has narrowed by eight percentage points. But we know there is more to do.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2008/sep/05/raceinschools.sats\">Blog: Does school testing have a bias against black pupils?</a></p> <h2>In numbers</h2> <p>A <strong>third</strong> of the most capable black Caribbean pupils are not entered to take the hardest papers in tests at 14 </p> <p>Black Caribbean and mixed white-and-black Caribbean children are excluded at rates <strong>three times greater</strong> than that for white children</p> <p>In 2007 <strong>44.9%</strong> of black Caribbean pupils, and <strong>47.3%</strong> of pupils of mixed white and black Caribbean heritage, achieved 5 or more A*-C grades, compared to <strong>57.3%</strong> nationally</p> <p>The gap between black Caribbean achievement and the national average at GCSE has narrowed by <strong>eight percentage points</strong> in four years</p> <p>In 2005 there were <strong>twice</strong> as many black men in prison in the UK than in universities</p>",
  "<p>Only a week ago few people outside Alaska knew anything at all about Sarah Palin. Seven days on she has become the biggest hot-button political story in the English-speaking world, and her fame is rocketing. Hers is the name in the headline that guarantees a million website hits. But does all that make Palin the defining factor in November's US election? I don't think so.</p> <p>There has been a concerted attempt by the Republican machine in St Paul this week to trash the American media as being too liberal and too establishment to understand the Palin phenomenon. Maybe it is true that the first reflex in some of the political media was to dismiss her as an amateur, a gimmick or just a rightwing crazy. But the media are energised by stories, not ideology. The danger now, after the impact of her speech on Wednesday, is not that the media will underestimate Palin but that it will overestimate her.</p> <p>As Hurricane Sarah blasts through American politics, many lose their bearings and get the whole Palin thing out of proportion. That is nowhere more true than here in St Paul itself. Yes, she lit the touchpaper on a convention that had previously been a damp squib. But the overcompensation is absurd. It sometimes feels as though the selfsame people who at the start of the week were saying that Palin was certain to lose John McCain this election are now saying that she is certain to win it for - and in spite of - him.</p> <p>This is madness, short-termism and loss of judgment. Yesterday, post-Palin but pre-McCain, her convention debut was the only game in town. Did you see her? What did you think? Wasn't it electrifying? Today, post-McCain and pre-whatever the next thing is, Palin is already beginning to slip back into some sort of bigger and more considered context. Give it a week, give it a month, and it will all look rather different again.</p> <p>That doesn't in any way mean that Palin has not made a major impact. She is an exciting rightwing newcomer and modern democratic politics is far more receptive to good women leaders than some critics pretend, as the flawed Palin and the flawed Hillary Clinton have both proved. But this isn't a movie. This isn't Geena Davis in Commander in Chief. It isn't Jane Horrocks in The Amazing Mrs Pritchard. Palin is one important factor among several in this election, and the real challenge, especially here in the eye of the storm, is get her into some perspective.</p> <p>Karl Rove, who is entitled to be listened to with wary respect on such matters, said after her speech that Palin brought three things to the Republican ticket this year. She was, he said, a capable executive, she knew about energy policy, and she could attack with a smile on her face. She made a good populist pitch, he added, but she might have been unwise to keep the Palin family issues in play without absolutely nailing them. It was a pretty sober assessment by an arch-partisan. There was no hint there that this was a transformative candidacy or that the old rules suddenly no longer applied.</p> <p>Indeed, if you probe Rove's three positives, none of them stands up particularly well to scrutiny. Palin may be a competent executive, but two terms as mayor of a town of 10,000 people followed by 18 months as governor of America's third least populated state do not add up to conclusive proof that she is ready to lead the country. She may indeed know about energy policy - it was one of the more substantial parts of her speech - but she is also a driller from a pro-drilling party that is heavily financed by drillers and she said not one word on Wednesday about climate change. Even in gas-guzzling America, that is not self-evidently a populist pitch.</p> <p>Palin can certainly attack. That line about being a pitbull in lipstick was a cracker. You knew instantly where the Sarah Barracuda tag came from. And she proved it in the speech too, with sharp, brutal blows about Barack Obama's years as a community organiser, about his disdain for guns and religion, and about the Styrofoam Greek columns of his Denver acceptance speech. But will either male or female voters want a long-term relationship with a political dominatrix from the Arctic? That's another question.</p> <p>Do not, in any case, exaggerate the importance of the running mate in American presidential elections. Traditionally, the role of the number two on the ticket is to carry their own state, to attack the other party's presidential nominee, and to do well in the televised vice-presidential debate. Palin looks well equipped to do all three. As well as Alaska, she will play well in swing states such as Nevada and New Mexico. But even if she does well against Joe Biden on October 2, how much will it matter? By far the most celebrated knock-out blow in a veep debate in modern times was delivered by Lloyd Bentsen on Dan Quayle in 1988. Yet who ended up in the White House? </p> <p>In the short term, Palin's unquestionable achievement is to have energised a Republican convention and a Republican base that remains uneasy about McCain. Hers was the sort of speech that George Bush, at his best, could do with great effect. Yet it would be a mistake to cast Palin simply as a social conservative from central casting, bent on reviving the culture wars of the 1990s - even though, in some respects, that is the effect of her candidacy.</p> <p>There was a smarter framing of Palin's candidacy in the New York Times this week by the conservative columnist David Brooks. Palin, he suggested, is that rarest of beings - an American politician who sees the world in the same way as McCain sees it. As with McCain, the thing that seems to make Palin get up in the morning is the desire to root out corruption and selfishness. Like him, she is less interested in the left-right or identity prism than in the crusade of virtue against vice. The problem, says Brooks, is that a McCain-Palin administration would be light on pragmatism and deal-making. It could all be a recipe for glorious failure.</p> <p>If that is right, or even half-right, it is a necessary reminder that this election is not about Palin. The contest is between a candidate who wants to break with Bush's policies and one who wants to break with his instincts. It is between Obama and McCain and, though there is still all to play for, it very much remains Obama's to lose.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> As a glance at the above photo will confirm, the last time Jamie Murray won a grand slam mixed doubles title he could only see out of one eye. That has to be good news from a British perspective, because the more modestly coiffed 2008 vintage comes fully equipped with peripheral vision. So should we expect Murray, who partners Liezel Huber in tonight's US Open final against Cara Black and Leander Paes, the No5 seeds, to repeat the Wimbledon victory he achieved in tandem with Jelena Jankovic last summer? Yes and no.</p> <p>On the plus side, Murray and Huber are in fine fettle. They've dropped just one set en route to the final, and that was against the second seeds, Katarina Srebotnik and Nenad Zimonjic - a pair who have contested four grand slam mixed doubles finals, including three in succession at Roland Garros, where they were the champions in 2006. What's more, Huber - as you'd expect from the joint world No1 - knows her way around a doubles court, having won twice at Wimbledon and once in Australia.</p> <p>The bad news? Each of Huber's grand slam wins was achieved alongside tonight's opponent, Black, who therefore has not only a similar pedigree - indeed, she shares the No1 ranking with Huber - but also a more accomplished partner: Paes, a former world No1 in doubles, has 39 titles to his name, including eight majors. He's also a total genius in the forecourt, so Murray and Huber will have their work cut out.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray/Huber 0-1 Paes*/Black </strong>It takes Paes all of three seconds to demonstrate that the fifth seeds means business. Having fired an early warning shot across the Murray bows by slamming an overhead at the Briton's nether regions on the opening point, Calcutta's finest wraps up his opening service game to 15 with a beautiful half-volley winner down the line. First blood to the seeded pair.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray*/Huber 1-1 Paes/Black </strong>Paes - playing in the deuce court, which is unusual for the man in mixed - struggles to make much impression against the Murray serve, which the Briton directs accurately into the Indian's body. No quarter given so far; Murray holds to 15.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray/Huber 1-2 Paes/Black* </strong>Murray and Huber squander a promising position at 15-30 on the Black serve, the Scot failing to control a volley after a rapid-fire exchange at the net. The seeded pair hold to 30, but there were some promising signs there for Murray and Huber.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray/Huber* 2-2 Paes/Black </strong>Huber holds with considerably greater ease than Black, who shanks a forehand return horribly on the final point. Murray and Huber hold to love, and it would be fair to say they've looked the more impressive pairing on the return so far.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray/Huber 2-3 Paes*/Black </strong>A double fault from Paes at 30-15 suggests that the first break of the match might be on the cards, but the Indian snuffs out the danger with two stinging wide serves, neither of which are returned.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray*/Huber 3-3 Paes/Black </strong>Paes stretches Murray wide on the opening point with an acutely-angled forehand return, but the Scot responds with a wonderful pick up on the half-volley to regain the initiative. After double faulting on the next point, Murray takes control of the game with some fine serving to hold to 15. Now let's see if they can make an impression on the Black serve.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray/Huber 3-4 Paes/Black* </strong>Despite again looking vulnerable on serve, Black holds to 30 once more. Two fine returns carry Murray and Huber to 0-30, but Paes then imposes himself at the net and Black completes the hold with a solid smash at Huber's ankles.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray/Huber* 4-4 Paes/Black </strong>It's Huber's turn to be tested, and the world's finest female doubles player comes through in convincing fashion. Paes steps up the pace on the return, and Huber quickly finds herself 15-30 down. She subsequently double faults to bring up two break points, but Murray makes a fine interception and a solid serve takes it to deuce, from where it's sudden-death. Huber makes no mistake, Black failing to control another deep delivery as the unseeded pair stay firmly in contention.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray/Huber 4-5 Paes*/Black </strong>Paes holds again, although it's slightly less comfortable for the Indian maestro this time as Murray and Huber scramble to fashion a break opportunity at 40-30. It comes to nought and Murray will have to serve to stay in the opening set.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray*/Huber 5-5 Paes/Black </strong>Murray holds comfortably to maintain the status quo. It'll be interesting to see how Black, who has looked the most breakable of the quartet so far, fares on serve at the business end of the set.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray/Huber 5-6 Paes/Black* </strong>Paes was obviously thinking along similar lines to me - he takes matters in hand with some typically adroit net play, and Black completes her most comfortable hold to date.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray/Huber* 6-6 Paes/Black </strong>Huber, her turquoise outfit flecked with visible signs of endeavour even before she stepped up to serve, was certainly sweating there. At 40-30 she appeared to have double faulted, setting up a sudden-death point that would have left Paes and Black within a point of the opening set. Instead, a successful appeal to Hawkeye results in the point being replayed. Huber finds a solid first delivery, Murray slams away the volley, and a tiebreak beckons.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>Paes/Black win the first set 7-6 (8-6)</strong>Huber hits a beautiful forehand topspin lob winner to give the unseeded pair a 3-1 lead in the tiebreak. Paes holds both his service points in typically robust style, but a brutal smash from Murray brings up two set points for Murray and Huber at 6-4. Black, though, pulls off a superb reaction volley to save the first, and Murray then misses a sitter at the net to make it honours even at 6-6. Paes and Black make the most of the reprieve, reaching set point following a Huber groundstroke error before Paes slams away a backhand volley to wrap up the opener. The Indian lets out a huge bellow after that one, and no wonder.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray*/Huber 1-0 Paes/Black; Paes/Black lead by one set to love </strong>Murray puts the disappointment of the tiebreak behind him with a solid service game, but that missed volley will come back to haunt him if they lose this now.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray/Huber 1-1 Paes*/Black; Paes/Black lead by one set to love </strong>A game in which two break points go begging just about sums things up for Murray and Huber, who have failed to make the most of the openings that have come their way so far. Having been the hapless recipient of a 119mph ace at 30-40, Murray nets an inviting second serve on the next point. He'll have to do better at the key moments if they're going to get back into this.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray/Huber* 2-1 Paes/Black; Paes/Black lead by one set to love </strong>Huber lets out a squeal of delight after recovering from break point down to keep it on serve.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray/Huber 2-2 Paes/Black*; Paes/Black lead by one set to love </strong>After an uncertain start, Black is going from strength to strength on serve; another convincing hold for the fifth seeds.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray*/Huber 2-3 Paes/Black; Paes/Black lead by one set to love </strong>It's been coming, if truth be told. Murray hasn't looked a happy bunny since letting the first set slip with that netted volley, and his discomfort manifest itself here in the form of two double faults. Murray hangs on gamely to reach deuce, but a fine return from Paes on the sudden-death deuce point has the Scot stretching, enabling Black to make another decisive intervention at the net. That's the first break of the match, and it'll be a long road back for Murray and Huber now.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray/Huber 2-4 Paes*/Black; Paes/Black lead by one set to love </strong>Aided by some sharp volleying from the increasingly confident Black, Paes consolidates the break.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray/Huber* 3-4 Paes/Black; Paes/Black lead by one set to love </strong>Another sudden-death denouement, another scare for Murray and Huber. This time, though, they hold on, although only after Huber has heartened club players everywhere with a protracted demonstration of how difficult it can be to put away an easy volley.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray/Huber 3-5 Paes/Black*; Paes/Black lead by one set to love </strong>Black holds again as the seeded pair move within a game of the title.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray*/Huber 4-5 Paes/Black; Paes/Black lead by one set to love </strong>Murray puts the memory of that dropped service game behind him, although only after Paes has teased him with a typical display of forecourt guile at 30-0. Still, if Murray and Huber are to stay alive they'll have to make an impression on the Paes serve, something they've failed to do throughout.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray/Huber 4-6 Paes*/Black; Paes/Black win by two sets to love </strong>There's a brief glimmer of hope for Murray and Huber when Paes misses an easy overhead on the opening point, but the Indian draws on all his formidable experience to seal the game - and with it, the title. Murray is once again culpable at the net when he fluffs a makeable volley at 30-15, but you've got to hand it to Paes and Black: throughout a tight match, they've simply been tougher on the key points.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan police commissioner, said today there was no truth in a report that ministers, officials and senior police chiefs were secretly discussing plans to remove him before his contract runs out in February 2010. </p> <p>Quoting from Mark Twain, he told reporters outside Scotland Yard: \"The report of my death is an exaggeration. I have a job to do: I am getting on with it and will continue to do so.\" </p> <p>He said there had been no discussions about whether his contract should be renewed, but he failed to say whether he wanted an extension. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4670564.ece\">The Times today reported</a> one senior source as saying \"the grey suits are gathering\", while another \"well-placed\" source was quoted as saying: \"He has become the issue. There comes a point when fairness has nothing to do with it and what matters is the integrity of the organisation.\"</p> <p>Scotland Yard said in a statement that no discussions had taken place about Blair's contract. \"The commissioner still has 18 months to serve on his original contract and has had no discussions with anyone about this being extended and has received no written correspondence on this matter.\"</p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said: \"The home secretary has full confidence in Sir Ian Blair and the Home Office has been involved in no discussions of this nature.</p> <p>\"Sir Ian Blair has a year and a half of his contract to run and it is far too early to be making decisions about whether or not it should be extended.</p> <p>A Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) spokesman said: \"The procedure followed by the MPA is to write to serving Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) rank officers, together with their line managers, 18 months prior to the culmination of an existing contract to seek their views of extending that contract.</p> <p>\"In the case of the Commissioner of the Metropolis, a royal appointment, the views of the home secretary would be sought.\"</p> <p>He said no letters had been or were about to be sent in the case of Blair.</p> <p>Blair, 55, has regularly been criticised in the media since taking over Britain's top policing job, and has been unpopular with some members of his own rank and file who feel he is too politically correct.</p> <p>But as he pointed out in his statement, most commissioners in the past 30 years have served only one five-year term anyway. The exception was Sir Paul Condon, who was in office for seven years during the 1990s.</p> <p>Most recently, Blair has become embroiled in an embarrassing high-profile row with one of his most senior colleagues and Britain's highest ranking Muslim officer, Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, who has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/29/police.race\">accused him of racial discrimination</a>.</p> <p>Last November, Blair survived a no-confidence vote from his force's presiding body, the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA), over the fatal shooting of the Brazilian electrician <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/menezes\">Jean Charles de Menezes</a>, who was mistaken by officers for a suicide bomber. The Met was found guilty in a criminal court case of breaking health and safety laws over the July 2005 killing.</p> <p>Although crime overall has fallen, the recent spate of teenage knife crime has not enhanced Blair's reputation.</p> <p>The Times said senior officials were planning to move against him once he had acted as a \"lightning conductor\" for criticism expected when an inquest into the Brazilian's death is held later this month. Several senior police chiefs have already been suggested as a successor.</p> <p>The procedure for terminating Blair's contract early lies in the Police Act 1996, which states that the MPA and the home secretary can call upon the commissioner \"to retire in the interests of efficiency or effectiveness\".</p>",
  "<p>Thrillingly, kids, there is news of Kate Middleton, Lost in Showbiz's second favourite indolent arriviste.</p> <p>In recent months - years, maybe? - Prince William's girlfriend has had to endure the barbs of those vulgarians too benighted to understand the demands of being a permanently-auditioning consort. Waspish courtiers have reportedly nicknamed her \"Waity Katie\"; even the Queen was said to have been concerned that the public perceives madam as workshy.</p> <p>And so it is that this week \"close family friends\" have decided they can brook no more, and have taken to the pages of Hello! magazine, where they unleash the most momentous employment news. To wit: Kate already HAS a job. </p> <p>Before we find out what is is, though, they are good enough to remind us why other employment possibilities were discounted. She wanted to work in a gallery, but couldn't, because of \"the galleries' wide, plateglass windows\". She briefly worked in some capacity at Jigsaw's HQ, but as her boss points out: \"she needed an element of flexibility to continue the relationship with an incredibly high-profile man and a life that she can't always anticipate.\"</p> <p>And now? Well, these friends harrumph, Kate \"actually does have a 'proper job' in an office \u2026 She is busy nine-to-five, five days a week\". But where? </p> <p>Why, at her parents' <a href=\"http://www.partypieces.co.uk/\">children's party planning business</a>, of course! </p> <p>Kate \"is helping to put together the all-important <a href=\"http://www.partypieces.co.uk/pages/cataloguerequest/cataloguerequest.asp\">catalogues</a> for the mail order outfit\". Also: she's on a charity committee organising a rollerdisco next month.</p> <p>So there you have it. And whilst it's tempting to see Kate's move into the notoriously competitive helping-your-parents-with-their-brochures field as indicative of a new career ambition so ball-breaking that it could derail her glacial progress toward the status of royal fiancee \u2026 really, nothing could be farther from the truth. You can't fight nature, and no matter how many high-level sections of that 24-page catalogue she arduously approves, nor how many ice sculptures she orders for the rollerdisco, sooner or later her biological sloth is going to start ticking. </p> <p>As Spinal Tap's David St Hubbins once observed, if he weren't in a band, he'd be \"a full-time dreamer\" - so let's accept that the ad-hoc-brochure-assistant game is going to lose one of brightest stars someday soon, and just pray the rollerdisco isn't a casualty too.</p>"
