  "<p>The senior officer at the centre of the Scotland Yard race row is hiring a team of private security guards after receiving numerous death threats which he claims were made by serving Metropolitan Police officers. </p> <p>Tarique Ghaffur, the country's most senior Asian policeman, is considering taking leave of absence after receiving a 'barrage' of threats following his claim for racial discrimination against Sir Ian Blair, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, and other senior officers.</p> <p>London law firm Dean and Dean, who are representing Ghaffur, said they were hiring private bodyguards to protect the 53-year-old and his family because of the ferocity of feeling directed at him by a hard core of Met officers. Among the scores of death threats Ghaffur has received, a significant proportion are said to have come from 'internal' sources, inside Scotland Yard.</p> <p>The allegations herald a new low for race relations in the Met. Last night Ghaffur was said to be living in fear of his life and that of his family and was exploring the option of taking 'gardening leave'. </p> <p>Ghaffur's lawyer, Shahrokh Mireskandari, said: 'He is considering the best course of action for the sake of his own protection and that of his family.' A friend of Ghaffur's added: 'He has received a barrage of hate threats, many of them actual death threats from internal as well as external sources. His position could now be untenable.' </p> <p>Despite his \u00a31m damages claim on the grounds that he has been the victim of racial, religious and age discrimination, Ghaffur has previously said he would continue to work alongside senior colleagues. Privately, a number of senior police figures believe that the Ugandan-born policeman should be transferred to another job outside the Met or go on leave pending the outcome of his case. Sources at the Yard have revealed that a number of senior colleagues believe it is no longer possible to work closely with him.</p> <p>Ghaffur has chosen not to notify Scotland Yard formally of the death threats made against him because he feels that he can no longer trust the Met to protect him.</p> <p>'You cannot go to the people who you are suing for racial discrimination and ask them to look after you, therefore he needs other means,' Mireskandari said. The lawyer added that hate mail and threats against his client had escalated following comments made by Blair's deputy, Sir Paul Stephenson, at a press conference rebutting Ghaffur's claims last Thursday. </p> <p>During the conference, Stephenson told Ghaffur to 'shut up' and 'stop making public statements about private disputes and get on with the job we are paid to do'. Mireskandari believes that such comments were unnecessarily inflammatory. </p> <p>Ghaffur, who is Muslim, accuses Blair of plotting to oust him and discriminating against him on the grounds of race, religion and age. His legal team say they have a dossier of papers purporting to prove that Ghaffur was the victim of a hate campaign. As an assistant commissioner in the Met, Ghaffur jointly holds the third-most senior rank in British policing, and earns \u00a3180,000 a year.</p> <p>Scotland Yard rejects all allegations of discrimination and has said it will robustly challenge Ghaffur's case.</p>",
  "<p>US private equity group Apollo Management has entered the bidding war for Reed Business Information, which is being sold by parent group Reed Elsevier for \u00a31bn. The sale includes publications such as Variety, Farmers Weekly and New Scientist</p> <p>Other private equity groups circling include Cinven, Candover, Bain Capital, Texas Pacific and Permira. Interest has also been shown by Gruner &amp; Jahr, the publishing subsidiary of Germany's Bertelsmann. Bidders are expected to submit final offers at the end of September.</p> <p>Reed, led by Crispin Davis, wants to pull out of advertising-dependent media and is offering to lend around \u00a3160m to the successful bidder. A further \u00a3560m will be offered as a loan by a consortium of banks. The decision to offer a loan to bidders underlines the company's determination to sell, despite funding constraints imposed by the credit crunch.</p> <p>Davis said recently that the business trade publication unit is growing too slowly and is too reliant on advertising revenue. Reed Elsevier has undergone significant restructuring in the last few years, with Davis also selling education, leaving the group to concentrate on science, medical and legal publishing. The company sells a significant proportion of its published works on the internet.</p>",
  "<p>Given the genocidal record of Belgium's King Leopold II in the Congo towards the end of the 19th century, the choice of Emmanuel de Merode - a descendant of Belgian royalty - as director of Africa's oldest national park might raise some eyebrows. But as crisis threatens to overwhelm Virunga National Park, which lies at the epicentre of a war zone, it is Merode's credentials that count rather than past colonial misdeeds.</p> <p>London-born Merode, a former head of the conservation group Wildlife Direct, is now responsible for the Democratic Republic of Congo's endangered mountain gorilla population, whose plight came to the world's attention last year when photographs of four bullet-ridden carcasses were published. The appointment follows a year which has seen rebel general Laurent Nkunda's army take over the park, swamping it with an estimated 16,000 armed militia.</p> <p>Last week saw the heaviest fighting between the rebels and government forces for a year, and at the centre of the fighting was the Virunga. A growing demand for bushmeat and other illegal products has led to massive and sustained attacks on the park's wildlife. The hippo population of Lake Edward, once the greatest in the world, has been nearly wiped out. The greatest reserve in Africa, with more mammal, bird and reptile species than any other ecosystem, is in grave peril.</p> <p>With financial help from the European Union, Merode hopes to re-establish the rule of law, save what remains of the wildlife and secure the park on a basis of stability and economic growth. It is, to put it mildly, a dangerous mission. A number of his predecessors have lost their lives. Caught up in Africa's bloodiest civil war and deadly fighting between gorilla poachers and illegal charcoal traders, the aristocratic director must manage 680 park rangers. There were once 800, but 120 trackers and guides have been slaughtered in the past decade. </p> <p>'I know this is a tough job,' Merode told The Observer 'You only have to look at the intensity of the conflict in and around the park to understand this is a daunting challenge, but it is a great privilege to be working alongside such a dedicated and courageous team of rangers.'</p> <p>The fate of the gorillas, believed to number around 190 of the world's remaining 700, is causing growing concern. Last year was the bloodiest on record, as 10 gorillas were shot and killed and two others went missing. The rangers don't know for certain the motive of the 'executions', but believe that charcoal traders are to blame. The great apes may have the potential to draw tourist revenue to a desperately poor region and bring in vital funding through conservation groups, but their environment is being destroyed around them. </p> <p>'Nobody knows what's happening to the gorillas up there,' says Felician, a local tracker. 'The few who go in can't find them in the upper slopes any more. We hear and sometimes see the fighting; we don't know if the gorillas are in the middle or in the outer edges.'</p> <p>'Despite the fighting, we are as determined as ever to get back in,' Merode said, adding that mortar and grenade explosions had been booming around the park for days. 'It is critical that we know the status of the mountain gorillas. The more cut off we are from them, the less chance we have of securing their survival.</p> <p>'The Democratic Republic of Congo is emerging from one of the most traumatic wars since the Second World War. All of its institutions, including the judicial system, are very frail, very fragile. Millions of innocent civilians have died. What has happened to the gorillas is a terrible tragedy, but it is in the context of something that's even worse. </p> <p>'What has driven the war in eastern Congo is the pillaging of natural resources. And be it the forests, be it the minerals, it's the richest country in the world with the poorest people. We're losing one of the world's greatest gems in terms of natural resources, in terms of human heritage and in terms of global heritage.'</p>",
  "<p>Like one of its leader's flamboyant costumes, Muammar Gadafy's Libya likes to stand out from its Arab neighbours. While his contemporaries are labelled president, the colonel takes the title \"Brotherly leader and guide of the revolution\". Rather than ruling a republic after seizing power in 1969, Gadafy created his own word \u2013 the Jamahiriya \u2013 to describe the system of councils and committees that veils his dictatorship. Now Tripoli seems to be defying another regional trend \u2013 set by Syria and emulated by Egypt \u2013 of lining up long-serving rulers' sons for succession in a hereditary republic. Gadafy's son, Saif al-Islam, announced this week that he has no intention of becoming leader and is <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7574083.stm\">retiring from politics</a> at the age of 36.</p> <p>Saif's denial that he's being <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4014147.stm\">groomed to succeed</a> is not surprising. He and his father have been quick to highlight Gadafy's unique role as \"revolutionary leader\", a position that will neither be inherited nor, according to <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070314/14libya.htm\">the colonel</a>, needed once he is gone. More incongruous is Saif's decision to \"retire\", given that he has nothing to officially retire from.</p> <p>Over the past few years, Gadafy's son has charmed his way around European capitals, speaking of a deep desire to reform his country \u2013 a doctorate from the LSE in one hand, and oil concessions for sale in the other. However, the colonel's second son has never held a position in the Libyan government, instead <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/dec/22/libya.brianwhitaker\">creating the</a> Gadafy International Foundation for Charity Associations \u2013 an organisation whose public role is as ambiguous and unspecified as that of its founder. </p> <p>In carefully orchestrated press conferences, Saif has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/world/africa/23libya.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin\">presented himself</a> as \"the un-Gadafy\". He is good-looking, speaks perfect English and has shown a willingness to criticise his father's regime, though stopping short of attacking Gadafy himself. He has encouraged western investment, while simultaneously rehabilitating Libya's image in the international community. From embracing the free market and internet democracy to fighting climate change, Saif has been saying almost everything Libya's critics have wanted to hear, making himself what George Joffe, of Cambridge University, calls \"the most likely potential leader\". </p> <p>Yet, for all his reformist rhetoric, Saif's only true power emanates from his father, making him at best the friendly moderating face of the established dictatorial order. While he might have had successes persuading his father of the benefits of the market, repairing relations with the west and <a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/libya/libya-031222-rferl-164042.htm\">abandoning WMD</a>, any suggestions of political reform have been met with fierce resistance by the colonel. Gadafy has called upon his allies to \"<a href=\"http://en.epochtimes.com/news/6-8-31/45530.html\">kill enemies</a>\" who dared to suggest reforming his Jamahiriya. Consequently Saif, while deriding the \"<a href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/News/africa/-/1066/463030/-/149hsmtz/-/index.html\">sea of dictatorships</a>\" in the Middle East, has simultaneously dismissed any suggestion that his father's power should be curbed. </p> <p>Might these limitations explain his withdrawal from politics? Saif's official explanation was that his messianic mission was done, with Libya now having the systems and institutions it lacked in the pre-Saif era. Yet a few economic improvements aside, the Jamahiriya dictatorship remains steadfastly in place, and reformists such as ex-prime minister <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4777332.stm\">Shukri Ghanem</a> have been sidelined, making this statement look either false or delusional. Alternatively, insiders have suggested that Saif has grown frustrated at the slow pace of reform and retired amid a rift with his father. </p> <p>Yet why bite the hand that feeds? It's clear that both the colonel and Saif benefit from each other: the son is given limited power to play high-profile reformist, while the father can put a young western face on his decrepit regime. Whatever disagreement has prompted Saif's retirement it is almost certainly a temporary blip, or even a cleverly planned publicity stunt in his slow ascendancy to power. No doubt he will soon be back in the spotlight. With <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/2597030/Colonel-Muammar-Gaddafis-son-and-heir-Seif-al-Islam-abandons-politics.html\">two local newspapers</a>, both owned by Saif, begging him to reverse his decision, don't be surprised to see the prodigal son return to the political fold by popular demand in the near future. </p> <p>Though Gadafy is still only 69, and holds a position that will no doubt be discontinued when he does leave the scene, all signs still point to Saif eventually assuming the role of de facto leader. His retirement and protests to the contrary fool few. Similar noises were made by Bashar al-Asad in the months before his father's death propelled him to the Syrian presidency in 2000, and you can be sure that Gamal Mubarak will say likewise right up until his appointment as Egypt's next ruler. For all its desire to appear unique, Libya's succession is looking awfully familiar.</p>",
  "<p>Back in 2000, Gordon Brown promised that \"within 10-20 years no one should be seriously disadvantaged by where they live\". Since then, the government's neighbourhood renewal fund has tried to improve employment, health, housing and schools in our most deprived areas. Progress has been made, but not enough. </p> <p>Two reports this week show that inequalities within and between our cities are still very stark. Far too many people are still disadvantaged by where they live. </p> <p>The UK now has 3 million households where no one is in full-time work, according to the <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Prep/8552.asp\">Office of National Statistics</a>. That affects almost 1.8 million children in Britain \u2013 one in seven. Most of these families live in the most run-down parts of our cities. Your chances of being in full-time work are much lower in Hull than in Cambridge. </p> <p>Life expectancy is also massively different depending on where you live, according to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/28/health.socialexclusion\">World Health Organisation</a>. If you live in Calton in Glasgow, your neighbours on average die aged 54. But if you live in nearby Lenzie, you can expect to live until 82. In London, average life expectancy in leafy Hampstead is 11 years longer than in St Pancras, just a couple of miles down the road.</p> <p>Poor health is not just the result of the so-called \"postcode lottery\" in the NHS. It's due to the wider urban environment in our poorest communities. Low employment rates and low incomes. Poor schools and housing. These all contribute to the poor health and short life expectancy in places like Calton.</p> <p>One way to tackle poor health is to raise employment rates in the poorest bits of our cities. Overall, the UK has more people in work than ever before. But we still have too many areas with too many people not in employment, and these are concentrated in many of our cities. </p> <p>Recent research from the Centre for Cities confirmed that worklessness is <a href=\" http://www.centreforcities.org/index.php?id=537\">largely an urban problem</a>. England's cities contain 59% of the country's population, but over 68% of those claiming benefits and 64% of the workless. Cities such as Liverpool illustrate the scale of the challenge, with a quarter of its working-age population on benefits. That's almost double the English average. </p> <p>Worklessness is not just a problem for Britain's largest cities. Hull and Hastings also have very high proportions of their working-age population on benefits.</p> <p>Low employment and worklessness are an urban problem, and require a tailored, city-level solution. \"Postcode lottery\" may be a problem in the NHS, but it's not a universal problem. Our cities each need to take their own unique approach to worklessness, tailored to their own labour markets and the skills of their residents. </p> <p>Our cities also need more powers to increase their employment rates. There's been plenty of devolution talk from ministers. James Purnell recently promised more \"power to the people\" and \"triple devolution\" to people, service providers and communities. But we've not yet seen any radical devolution of financial or political powers to city leaders. </p> <p>One of the reasons why regeneration funding has under-delivered over the past decade has been the over-centralised way that government has spent it. New programmes, like the working neighbourhoods fund, will be more effective if they genuinely devolve funding and powers to people in communities and across real city economies. </p> <p>Cities such as Liverpool and Birmingham now need more freedom to take their own approach to tackling worklessness, based on the needs of their local labour markets. This means direct control over training budgets, through new powerful skills and employment boards. These would set budgets for local back-to-work and training programmes \u2013 using funds devolved from the DWP, Jobcentre Plus and the proposed Skills and Funding Agency.</p> <p>This is now happening in the capital with the London Skills and Employment Board, chaired by the mayor, Boris Johnson. It's starting to influence job training across London. It will allow London's employers to have a bigger say over training programmes, and should help to increase the capital's relatively low employment rate \u2013 which at 70% is well below the national rate of 75%. </p> <p>Increasing employment in our poorest areas will help to improve the health of people who live there. But trying to do all that from Whitehall will not work. Cities are best placed to sort out their own labour markets, with support from the centre. More powerful cities stand a better chance of improving employment prospects in their poorest areas. That's the best prescription for economic growth and healthy communities.</p> <p><em>This article was amended on Monday September 1, at 10.30am.</em></p>"
