Only when the contestant has made a choice will the real date be revealed.</p> <p>Black, 65, the Liverpool-born singer who went on to carve out a successful career as a TV presenter, hosted Blind Date for 18 years before stunning bosses by announcing on the first live episode that she was quitting. At the peak of its popularity in the 1980s, it was watched by 17 million viewers. </p> <p>Sky1 is currently developing a pilot for a 10-part series of Loveland, which is scheduled to air next year. The show is the first commission for Challenge Anneka creator Tom Gutteridge's new Newcastle-based company, Standing Stone Productions.</p> <p>Black, whose husband Bobby died of cancer in 2001, has undertaken a number of broadcasting projects since quitting Blind Date in May 2003, including Sky1's 50 Greatest TV Endings and BBC Radio 2's Icons Revisited. However, Loveland will be her first major series.</p> <p>\"Loveland captivated me with its modern-day twist on the dating format, bringing something fresh and exciting to the genre,\" Black said yesterday.</p> <p>The Sky1 controller, Richard Woolfe, added: \"Cilla is the undisputed queen of the dating show. There's been many pretenders to her throne, but she remains in a class of her own.\"</p> <p>Loveland comes as ITV is mooted to be lining up a new dating show, with X Factor star Simon Cowell said to have bought a share of the rights to Blind Date.</p> <p>As part of Sky1's new autumn season, unveiled last night, presenters Fearne Cotton and Ben Shephard will also front the hour-long special Guinness World Records Smashed!, in which members of the public and celebrities will attempt to topple records in front of a studio audience. </p> <p>Cotton has found success fronting the US version of the Guinness World Records shows on NBC. </p> <p>Sky1 has also acquired the UK rights to the Battlestar Galactica prequel, Caprica, while former EastEnders star Ross Kemp will return for a fourth series of the Bafta-winning Ross Kemp on Gangs.</p> <p>Matt Groening's sci-fi comedy animation series Futurama will air 16 new episodes after a five-year gap, following the success of its DVD releases, while The Simpsons' 20th season will include its first post-watershed episode, Love Springfieldian Style. The episode will air after 9pm because of the \"adult nature of its content\".</p> <p>Jack Bauer will also return after a two-year break with a feature-length, real-time special, 24: Exile, starring Robert Carlyle and Jon Voight and filmed on location in South Africa. As part of a refreshment of the BSkyB entertainment channel, Sky1 will also unveil a revamp of its onscreen look, with a new light-blue logo.</p> <p>Woolfe said: \"The vibrant, energetic look reflects our strengthening entertainment positioning and puts the standout content right at its heart.\"</p>",
  "<p>On August 18, Jessica Harrison will fulfil her dream. Wearing a swimming suit bearing her name on chest and derriere, Harrison will represent her country at triathlon in the Beijing Olympics. But there's a twist. Despite being Oxford-born and bred, Harrison will be racing in the red, white and blue of France, not Britain.</p> <p>\"It almost seems normal but seems sort of weird as well,\" she explains. \"When I used to dream about going to the Olympics it wasn't very specific but you just assume you're going to race for Britain\".</p> <p>Her journey to the French team began back in 1999. After leaving university, Harrison moved to her parents' house in the south of France in order to take advantage of the hot-weather training conditions. She missed out on the British Olympic team in 2004 \u2013 \"it was fair enough, I wasn't quick enough\" \u2013 and after a big wake up call in her private life in 2005, she chose to \"grab life and triathlon by the balls.\" By then she had become a naturalised French citizen, was the highest-ranked female triathlete in France and was racing for her local club, Poissy.</p> <p>The decision to represent France, she says, was not a difficult one. \"It got to the point where I wasn't English to the English and not French to the French\". She decided to \"make it official, it was good for my club and good for my career\".</p> <p>But this wasn't just a cold-blooded career move for Harrison. \"The first time I was up on the podium listening to the Marseillaise it actually did bring a tear to my eye,\" she says. \"I would never have believed it of myself\". Having never been a particular patriot to Britain, Harrison ponders the French enthusiasm for their country. She finds it \"refreshing that there aren't any negative overtones. Whatever your politics, they're really quite into being French and loving the anthem\".</p> <p>In the run up to the Olympics, Harrison has been looking after herself. \"A lot of people say I should train as if this is a once in a lifetime event, but I don't want to burn out when I get there. I'm following the same routine, just more of it\". Having made sure she eats well and gets enough \"fish, vitamins and magnesium\" there is another benefit: \"I can see my abs for once, that's quite cool. I'm going to take a photo to show my grandchildren\".</p> <p>So what about the Olympic pressure and the effect on Harrison's performance? \"It could be positive for some people and negative for others, you just don't know until you get there,\" she says. \"I'm a bit of a show off so I'll quite like people cheering me on and sending me messages.\" There is, she admits, a weight of expectation \"but you have to remember it's a race, just a race\".</p> <p>Although Beijing is where her concentration lies right now, Harrison has no plans to relax. \"I owe a last couple of grands prix races to my club, and there's the Triathlon World Cup in France in September too. I want to really make the most of the physical form that I should have after the Games\". With any kind of social life having gone out the window in the Olympic run up, Harrison plans to make up for this with just a couple of weeks off in October.</p> <p>And then of course there is London 2012. \"When this is over and done with, that is my next thing,\" she says. \"It would really be awesome to do the Games at home in front of family and friends\". Harrison will be 34 in 2012, but doesn't think age will be a problem. \"It's definitely doable. If I can stay relatively injury free and not burn out and keep my motivation going, it's doable.\"</p> <p>It is striking to hear her refer to London as home, but as Harrison explains, \"you remember your roots, you're never going to lose that. I'll always be English to a certain extent\". Racing in the streets of London in 2012 is an exciting prospect. \"You don't get that every day. It's the best of both worlds for sure, family and friends from both Britain and France\".</p> <p>So with final preparation well under way Harrison will finally reach her goal of competing in the Olympics, albeit for a country who have adopted her as much as she has adopted them. \"They have welcomed me with open arms. I want to be the best I can for them, to me this is paying back my debt\".</p>"
