  "<p>Paul Gladstone Reid is something of a rarity in classical music. At 17 he founded a 15-piece jazz touring orchestra. At 25 he composed a string quartet. Before he hit 30 his work was being performed by the Royal Philharmonic, and last year he was awarded the MBE for services to music. He is one of the UK's most promising musical talents, but there is another reason why he is exceptional: Gladstone Reid is black. </p> <p>In the historically rarefied world of classical music, this makes him an anomaly. Ethnic minorities account for almost 10 per cent of Britain's population and yet the vast majority of our music colleges, string quartets and orchestras remain overwhelmingly white. </p> <p>Born in Jamaica and raised by a Seventh Day Adventist family in Sheffield, Gladstone Reid is one of the very few black musicians who has made it to the top. 'A lot of black people went to music college and enjoyed it but there is a clear race issue when it comes to employment at the end of that,' he says. 'There's a sense [among conductors] of: \"Why would I want one black spot in the orchestra? It spoils the view\".</p> <p>'People don't admit it but we all know racism is there. A friend of mine was the [black] principal cellist for the National Youth Orchestra. Normally you'd expect someone like that to walk into a job. He hadn't got a single interview in a year. There's a wall of silence.'</p> <p>Are our orchestras diverse enough? A cursory look at the figures reveals that they are certainly not representative of our multicultural society. The BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra is comprised of 76 core musicians, all of whom are white. Of the 63 members who make up the Ulster Orchestra, 62 are white and one is Asian. The Hall\u00e9 Orchestra in Manchester fares little better: out of 86 musicians, they employ one black Caribbean performer, one Chinese member and 14 white non-British nationals.</p> <p>Edmund Reid, now the leader of the Opera de Baug\u00e9 orchestra in north-west France, was born in Jamaica and came to Britain at 16 on a musical scholarship. For many years he found he was the only black musician in the orchestras he worked for, and when he auditioned for Sir Georg Solti at the Royal Opera House in 1964 it took two months for the committee to discuss 'whether it was OK to employ a black man'. 'I've had a pretty rocky time,' he says. 'When I started I told myself I wouldn't get in an orchestra if I played as well as the next person, so I decided I had to be 300 per cent better.'</p> <p>In 1987 Reid successfully took his then-employers, the English National Opera, to an industrial tribunal after they refused to give him the title of co-leader, despite acting as lead violin for two years. </p> <p>But statistics and individual experiences alone do not prove an endemic racism within the classical music community. Many orchestral auditions are undertaken 'blind', with musicians performing behind a screen, and all UK orchestras operate on an equal opportunities basis. Although there might, as in any walk of life, be the odd racist polluting the waters, the racial conformity of our orchestras points to a lack of non-white players coming up through the system.</p> <p>David Lammy, the black Labour MP for Tottenham and former Culture Minister, insists that the issue goes beyond race boundaries. To see it as a black and white issue oversimplifies a far more complex problem. According to Lammy, the ethnic composition of our orchestras is more a question of class and social deprivation.</p> <p>'The problem is that the model of taking your instrument home and practising every day for an hour doesn't apply to inner city environments; it doesn't apply to a lot of communities, it's not just black communities. For my constituents, the idea they can take an instrument home to their council estate, to a house they share with many brothers and sisters, and practise on their own without the support of their parents, is just implausible.'</p> <p>For parents to encourage the level of dedication required to reach the top echelons of orchestral performance, says Lammy, they must first be familiar with a classical music tradition that is rooted in a white, Christian historical context. Gladstone Reid was fortunate that his great-grandfather was an Anglican choirmaster and his father taught him how to play the guitar from the age of seven. Lammy, too, was exposed to classical music as a cathedral chorister. But for many young musicians there is no such frame of reference.</p> <p>Outside Britain there are successful grassroots models for getting underprivileged youths into music, often with transformative results. At 13 Lennar Acosta was living on the streets in his native Venezuela with a crack habit and a .38 calibre gun. At 15 he was in a young offenders' institute in Caracas, surrounded by other delinquents who, just like him, had been abandoned by their families and mainstream society. Then, he was given a clarinet and his life started to change. 'I didn't know what it was,' he recalled, several years later. 'I was fascinated when I saw it.'</p> <p>Acosta is an alumnus of El Sistema Youth Orchestras Project, a visionary project founded 33 years ago by the economist Jose Abreu. It provides free music tuition for disadvantaged children, and so far over 270,000 children have benefited. For Acosta, the results were indelible: 'Music saved my life. It helped me let out a lot of the anger inside.' </p> <p>Britain, says Lammy, has much to learn from the Venezuelan model: 'It's about group practice, it's as much about childcare and community as it is about music. We need to be a lot more imaginative about what classical music can offer.'</p> <p>Part of the problem in the UK stems from a chronic underfunding of school music education. The Thatcher government of the 1980s capped spending on schools in an attempt to keep the lid on council tax rises. Music lessons and after-school orchestras fell by the wayside. 'It's a failure of general education,' says Norman Lebrecht, a Radio 3 presenter. 'Over the past 30 years we've reduced the cultural exposure of children. It's been an educational dereliction and you have to nail it to the lapels of the politicians.'</p> <p>Some efforts are being made to rectify the imbalance. The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, for instance, currently has 28,000 young people from diverse backgrounds in its education programmes. Yet all of this may miss the point; perhaps young musicians from ethnic minorities simply do not want to follow the restrictive classical route. 'Culturally, classical music is of Western origin,' says Haylie Ecker, the first violinist for the multi-million selling classical crossover group Bond. 'Some of the best musicians in history are black, but they express themselves in the forms of jazz, soul, hip-hop and pop.' Still, if a promising black musician decides against a career in classical music, it should, ideally, be a question of choice, not necessity.</p> <h2>Chi-Chi Nwanoku, MBE</h2> <p><strong>Double bassist, founder member and principal double bassist of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and fellow of the Royal Academy of Music </strong></p> <p>I got into music without even knowing it was classical. I was round at a schoolfriend's and heard her older brother playing 12-bar blues. I was seven and I wouldn't leave the room because I was transfixed. I stood there until he taught me how to play it, and every day I'd go back just to get my hands on that piano. My parents offered to scrape everything together for piano lessons and in about two weeks I could read music - I just got it. In my last year of school my teachers advised me to take up an unpopular orchestral instrument. So I took up the double bass and went to learn it at Cambridge Tech. I then went on to the Royal Academy of Music. I was encouraged to go out and seize the world and not give a thought to race. The only kind of race I was into was to be a 100-metre sprinter. Generally we must find a method to convince young people there are better ways to feel proud of themselves. Music is one of them - it is a natural bridge between the beat of a heart and the beat on the street.</p> <h2>Althea Ifeka</h2> <p><strong>Oboist, won third prize at the Paris International Interpretation competition last year. Her debut CD, From Leipzig to London, was released in 2006</strong></p> <p>What I have to say is probably very un-PC, but I'm going to say it anyway. The lack of black orchestral musicians is about money, not colour. It's a bad career choice. Norman Lebrecht has explored this very well. As a soloist and conductor you can earn a lot but orchestral musicians face many years of training followed by pitiful pay. I work mainly as a soloist and teach now but I did have a big orchestral career in the past. I have lots of African and Asian children in my teaching practice. First-generation immigrants don't want their children going into a profession that is uncertain and poorly rewarded. </p> <p>Like Chi-Chi Nwanoku I'm mixed race, and I owe my career to my white upbringing. If I had been brought up in Nigeria with my dad, I wouldn't be where I am today. In Africa classical music is nowhere. There are class issues because classical music is seen as a middle-class, upper-class pursuit. Middle-class Africans are buying into the idea of classical music, so we will see a change in the next 25 years. In my opinion, classical music is the highest art form, and you can't keep it down. There are working-class people in Britain's orchestras. It's traditional that lots of our brass sections come from the north and straight from colliery bands. Not everybody is privately educated in British orchestras; there is a range. </p> <p>I'm not sure why there are more Japanese and Chinese classical musicians. I know there has been a huge explosion in classical music in China I don't think there is an accessibility problem here; the orchestras are bending over backwards to be open and accessible. They have big educational budgets and the ticket prices are ridiculously cheap. Paying \u00a36 at the Royal Festival Hall is nothing when you consider the quality of what you are getting in return and how much that product cost to be realised.</p> <p>I have never experienced racial prejudice in an orchestra. They might be surprised to see me, but soon get used to me. I partly grew up in Australia and I faced so much racial discrimination there, so I know what racial discrimination is and I've never experienced it in this profession. It is a meritocracy. The idea of quotas is offensive to me, and social engineering the make-up of orchestras would be unacceptable. </p> <p>When I have applied for teaching jobs at public schools I definitely got the impression that my face didn't fit. They express concern that my performing career is too successful and might distract from the job, or rule me out because I can't play the piano, yet I've been to Cambridge and the Royal Academy of Music and I'm a Fulbright scholar.</p> <h2>David Kadumukasa</h2> <p><strong>30, cellist, graduated from the Royal College of Music in 2002</strong></p> <p>Both my parents are African first-generation immigrants. I'm the first in the family to play a musical instrument. I started playing cello when I was six after seeing a demonstration class in school.</p> <p>The orchestral scene is very specific and competitive. In some respects it's not a big deal that there aren't black and Indian Asian players in those orchestras because there are many, many people trying to get into the main orchestras. </p> <p>The lack of black and Indian Asian classical musicians generally stems back to who is learning at a young age. I think that's all changing. Many more people within these communities are taking up an instrument. In the past maybe parents of first-generation immigrants were determined that their children go into the more traditional professions where an income would be guaranteed. Now that an immigrant middle class is establishing itself people have a bit more freedom to go into a career in something like music. </p> <p>I went to a public school. There is a massive difference in music education in state and public schools. There are some state schools that really push music but I think in the main it is still the preserve of private schools. Music is perhaps more valued in public schools than in state schools in general. It's a very expensive thing to study. Lessons alone cost a lot of money, let alone buying an instrument. </p> <p>You still get the odd comment. People will say: 'There are not very many black cellists around.' I wouldn't say I've ever felt discrimination. Not so much now, but it has felt a little uncomfortable being the only black person in an orchestra or ensemble. I don't want to sound like I'm some revolutionary leader of black people in classical music but more people follow in your footsteps if you keep going in those situations.</p> <p>I would be totally against any kind of quota system. But I think orchestras have got a responsibility to look across the board for players and to involve themselves in projects that will introduce classical music to people outside their traditional audiences. </p> <h2>Uchenna Ngwe</h2> <p><strong>28, oboist, graduated from Trinity College of Music with a postgraduate diploma in 2004</strong></p> <p>I was born in Britain and both my parents are from Nigeria. Neither are musicians. In primary school I played some piano, then tried violin and later on oboe. At Hornsey School for Girls I started playing cello.</p> <p>My parents always encouraged us to do things we enjoyed. My mum does worry about the fact that, as a musician, unless you make it to the big time you're never going to earn that much money. She thought I was going to take up teaching so that I had some kind of steady income, which I did for about four years. Now I work with the national singing programme in schools as well as freelancing as a musician.</p> <p>There are lots of black and ethnic minority classical musicians freelancing - they just don't seem to be permanently based in orchestras. I like to play a wide range of music, so maybe other black and ethnic minority classical musicians feel that, like me, they don't want to be based in one style of music.</p> <p>I think it's important that young black and ethnic minorities can see role models in orchestras but I wouldn't encourage positive discrimination because it should be about talent. I got into music because I was encouraged by teachers and parents. It had nothing to do with having role models around me who looked like me.</p> <p>A lot of it is to do with financial situations - the cost of tuition and instruments, rather than race. It's very expensive playing a musical instrument to a high level. Your parents need to be willing and able to make sacrifices for that, or you need to have the money ready and available.</p> <p>I think it's more of an issue for people of a certain generation. If you look at black and ethnic minority students coming out of music college now, there's much more of a balance across the instruments rather than just everyone being singers and pianists.</p> <h2>Thanihan Jeyapalan</h2> <p><strong>19, first-year bassoon student at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama </strong></p> <p>I was born in Britain but my parents are Sri Lankan. I started playing cello at the age of 10, then I learnt piano, then trumpet, then bassoon. I did feel unusual because none of my friends or family were into classical music, but I was really musical, even as a baby. </p> <p>Lack of black and Indian classical musicians is partly a cultural problem. My parents couldn't imagine music as a career option so when I applied to GSMD I also applied to study medicine. I'm often the only black person in an orchestra when I play. </p> <p>I think the accessibility of orchestras is a big problem. Getting schools to visit orchestras is vital, as is cheaper ticket prices. I think the orchestras need to do a lot more to reach out. I want to play in the big orchestras so badly. It doesn't put me off that they are so white, it makes me even more determined.</p> <p><strong>Interviews by Katie Toms and Hermione Hoby</strong></p>",
  "<p>Next week Sebastian Coe will take part in artist Martin Creed's installation, Work No 850, which involves athletes running around Tate Britain. The Observer's Emma John helped inspire this new collaboration when she took another Olympic champion, Jonathan Edwards, to the exhibition when it opened in July. </p> <p><strong>The last time we chatted, I'd brought Jonathan to visit your work... </strong></p> <p>Aye, Jonathan said had I thought of using professional athletes? I thought it was a great idea because it would be like if you write music and you have your music played by the best musicians. The idea for this month's Olympic Hour [Friday 26 September] came directly from that meeting with Jonathan. He said he'd speak to the 2012 committee because they want to promote the connection between art and sport. I was very happy about it because I think it's the perfect marriage of the two things. </p> <p><strong>So you're hoping these chaps will shift faster than your volunteers?</strong></p> <p>(laughs) I hope so.</p> <p><strong>Who will be running?</strong></p> <p> There's going to be 10 or 15 professional athletes. Some are fresh from the Beijing Olympics. Some will be Paralympians. Sebastian Coe's going to do it. I'm wondering how fast he'll go. I grew up watching him so it's very exciting.</p> <p><strong>What difference will it make to the piece, using well-known athletes?</strong></p> <p>It should possibly be realised better, I think. They're the experts in the body. </p> <p><strong>Is there anyone you watched at the Olympics you'd particularly like to see perform your work?</strong></p> <p>The 100m and 200m sprinter guy, Usain Bolt, would be great!</p>",
  "<p>Allan McNish lines up his Le Mans 24 Hour race-winning Audi in third place on the 46-car grid for today's 1,000km race at Silverstone. McNish set a time of 1min 31.022sec, an average speed almost over 126mph, in qualifying around the 3.19-mile grand prix circuit. McNish held provisional pole until four minutes from the chequered flag in the 20-minute session when both Peugeots went quicker, St\u00e9phane Sarrazin ultimately claiming pole position 0.661secs quicker than the Scot.</p> <p>'I aim to sign off from this year's Le Mans Series season with a win - I'll be 100 per cent flat out to achieve that here on home soil,' said McNish afterwards. 'We're only just over half a second away from the Peugeots, which is the closest we've been all season.' </p> <p>The 38-year-old Scot and his Italian co-driver Dindo Capello will be aiming to chalk up the Audi R10's 20th race victory since its 2006 debut in the 620-mile race which gets under way at 11.20am. The R10 of Alexandre Pr\u00e9mat qualified fourth fastest over a second off McNish's time.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Stevie Wonder</strong> <br>O2 Arena, London SE10 </p> <p>Around the time when Tony Blair was freshly enthroned as Prime Minister and Bill Clinton was the as yet unsullied President of the world, there was much talk of the rock'n'roll generation coming into power. Unlike previous ruling classes, these were world leaders who had first-hand knowledge of popular music. They could play electric guitar. They might have even inhaled. They, surely, would never lead the world into another Vietnam, or worse.</p> <p>How naive we were. Either rock had taught these men nothing or they had forgotten all of it. There was also, of course, the possibilty that rock itself was not as revolutionary a genre as we had all assumed. </p> <p>Now another American election brings the hope not just of a rock'n'roll President, but a soul President. A funk President. A jazz President. A president with an iPod, who knows Stevie Wonder's back catalogue inside out. Not for Barack Obama, some ill-thought-out endorsement of the Arctic Monkeys; Obama is down with Stevie, for real. 'When I was at that point where you start getting involved in music,' the Democratic presidential hopeful told Rolling Stone recently, 'Stevie had that run with Music of My Mind, Talking Book, Fulfillingness' First Finale and Innervisions, then Songs in the Key of Life. Those are as brilliant a set of five albums as we've ever seen.' No, Obama didn't just get a greatest hits CD last Christmas.</p> <p>The feeling is mutual. Wonder, now a portly 58, has described Obama as a cross between John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. He has played at Obama rallies, and at the recent Democratic convention (along with John Legend, whom you might describe as Wonder's wannabe mini-me). </p> <p>It's no surprise, then, that Wonder's London gig comes peppered with Obama endorsements. 'Master Blaster (Jammin')', Wonder's 1980 ode to Bob Marley now contains the line 'Barack Obama's gonna be the next President', and at the end Wonder invokes God's blessing for him. As Britons aren't yet able to vote in the United States presidential elections, we probably escape lightly. </p> <p>In a sentimental, rambling aside that takes in the Martin Luther King national holiday in the US, the end of apartheid and his 'lovely' daughter, Aisha Morris (now one of his backing singers), Wonder tonight ascribes his latest two-year bout of touring as a reaction to his mother's death in 2006. (God, apparently, needed her more than Stevie did; now she is an angel, watching over us all. Sometime later she came to Wonder in a dream and told him to 'get his ass on the road'.)</p> <p>But there is no ignoring the frisson of electricity running through black music in the US at the moment, and, specifically, through Stevie Wonder, long an activist, and now court musician to the Sun King-to-be. Buoyed by liberal America's Obama-mania, he is in expansive mode. Led onstage by Aisha, beat-boxing into a microphone, he takes up the harmonica, paying tribute to Miles Davis's 'All Blues', into which he manages to work in the melody from 'London Bridge Is Falling Down', charming everyone from the off. </p> <p>When, finally, he mines his rich vein of peak-period hits in the final half hour, the aisles fill with the dancing figures of black, white, young and old. 'Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours' gives way to the irresistible lift of 'Sir Duke'. It's soon followed by 'Uptight (Everything's Alright)' and the peerless 'Superstition', played just like you remember them. Not for Wonder the endless rearranging indulged in by stars bored of their hits: he plays them all straight, if far too perfunctorily.</p> <p>Bizarrely, he interrupts this magisterial flow to ask for a moment of silence for the victims of 9/11. As an afterthought, Wonder amends it to include all unnecessary deaths in all wars throughout history. There is no doubting his sincerity. But for all the energy coursing through Wonder, his two-hour show suffers from a lack of focus and unforgivably bad pacing. Can you be struck down by God for insinuating that Stevie Wonder lacks a sense of rhythm? I'm braced.</p> <p>If you have a ticket for the forthcoming run of shows, you could do worse than just turn up around 9.15. You'll miss the rush-hour traffic, the queues for food and drink, and the long-winded run-up of ballads, the band solos, and the surfeit of call-and-response vocal warm-ups with the audience. ('You sound like my church!' Wonder gushes.) </p> <p>The interminable, mawkish ballads aren't all rotten - a brilliant version of 'Lately' has an older woman in floods of tears, with many others not far off - but they dominate two thirds of what should be an electrifying gig in Wonder's first European jaunt in 10 years. One interminable jazz-funk workout finds every band member taking a solo. It is close to torture, as two percussionists, two guitarists, the drummer, the bassist, the saxophonist, the trumpet-player and two keyboard players each funk out individually. At \u00a365 a ticket, this is indulgent, to say the least. </p> <p>Not even Wonder's deployment of a voice-bag vocoder can really get things moving, until 'Higher Ground' makes an appearance about seven songs in. Every time Wonder gets the crowd excited with a song played on the clavinet, he immediately follows it with a syrupy ballad on the piano, prompting everyone to sit down again. It's like church - but not in a good way. </p> <p>The amateurish visuals make several tedious songs worse. While many of tonight's tracks are lit up by laughably bad digital screensaver whorls, 'Golden Lady' features no less than a silhouette of a golden woman dancing. </p> <p>Perhaps the gig's nadir, 'Ribbon in the Sky' ('Ribbon! In the sky! Rrrrrrribbon! Rrrrribon! Rrribbit!' Wonder scats, in a very long coda) is illustrated by a red and gold ribbon flying through outer space. It may be in poor taste to note that Wonder might not have much input into this section of his show, but someone, somewhere needs to tell him that his music deserves better. If Obama is elected President of the United States, and Wonder has his ear, we can only hope that it is the questing, visionary Wonder he heeds, and not the comfortable, middle-aged star who has lost his sense of rhythm.</p> <h2>Vox pop</h2> <p>Did Stevie manage to bring the sunshine back into your life?</p> <p><strong>Sean Christian</strong><br>47, careworker</p> <p>It's brilliant to see Stevie back on stage and on top form. His vocal power is extraordinary and I've never known him so interactive with his audience. His energy was incredible. He really controlled the crowd.</p> <p><strong>Lorna Driver</strong><br>29, full-time mum</p> <p>I'm 29 and this was my first ever concert. It was excellent. We've come with our mum tonight because she introduced us to Stevie Wonder and we grew up with him. He didn't disappoint. </p> <p><strong>Mashiyane Mabunda</strong><br>24, credit analyst</p> <p>What a great night. He chose good tracks, not all the hits, but the ones that are most important to him. It brought back so many memories, and I loved it when he stood up on his piano stool for the medley at the end.</p> <p><strong>Steve Huber</strong><br>56, schoolteacher</p> <p>Starting off with Miles Davis's tune 'All Blues' was inspired. I got Stevie's first album, Uptight, when I was 15 and I've been a fan ever since. I loved the age-range of the crowd tonight - it's nice that there are new fans coming in.</p> <p><strong>Nicky Garratt</strong><br>39, office manager</p> <p>Overall it was a great night, but slow in places. It was mostly a show for couples - a few of them needed to get rooms! But I did phone my mum when he played 'Lately', and had a cry.</p> <p><strong>Interviews by Imogen Carter</strong></p>"
