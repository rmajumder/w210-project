  "<p>Britons are missing out on jobs at home and abroad because of their inability to speak languages other than English, the European Union commissioner for languages has warned.</p> <p>Leonard Orban, the EU commissioner for multilingualism, says that small- to medium-sized companies in the UK are increasingly turning to foreign nationals to fill jobs that call for more than one language.</p> <p>His comments came as it emerged that the European Commission is facing such a severe shortage of native English-speaking interpreters that meetings are being cancelled. The commission also warns that it may have to cut the number of documents it translates because of the dwindling number of British students with degrees in French and German.</p> <p>Since 2002, member states have been committed to a policy of working towards all citizens speaking their mother tongue plus two other languages. A league table to be in place by 2010 will show the competence of students in different EU countries at the end of compulsory schooling. It is widely accepted that Britain will be near the bottom .</p> <p>'British graduates are missing out on some of the best jobs at home and abroad because they are on the whole monolingual,' said Orban, a Romanian who speaks English, French and Italian. 'An English mother-tongue candidate with additional languages has an even more competitive edge, but let's not forget that only about 25 per cent of the world's population speaks English. If you know the local language and culture, you are more likely to clinch that lucrative business deal, so it is an economic problem for Britain as well,' he said.</p> <p>Likening himself to a doctor helping to cure Britain's poor language skills, Orban said research shows that employers see students with languages as more flexible and better able to build relationships with clients in other countries. 'It is important to promote language learning in the UK in order to give UK citizens the possibility of being more employable, because companies even in this country are hiring people of other nationalities who have better linguistic skills,' he said.</p> <p>Marco Benedetti, the EU's director-general for interpretation, says that a generation of staff who joined when the UK became part of the EU are about to retire and that young people are not coming out of universities to replace them. 'If we don't do something very soon, there will be more and more non-native English speakers obliged to interpret into English,' he said.</p> <p>The British government's decision to allow pupils to drop a modern foreign language at 14 has been blamed for the downturn in GCSE and A-level candidates. The numbers taking GCSEs began to decline in 2002, when Estelle Morris, the Education Secretary at the time, announced that languages would no longer be compulsory for 14 to 16-year-olds from 2004. Many schools pre-empted the policy and stopped entering weaker candidates before the deadline.</p> <p>The number of 16-year-olds taking GCSE French fell again this year, with 201,940 UK entries compared with 347,007 in 2001. Only 76,695 students sat GCSE German, down from 135,133.</p> <p>That trend is translating into a fall in the number studying languages at university. Only 610 students started degree courses in German last year, compared with 2,288 a decade ago, according to a study by the School of Oriental and African Studies. The number taking French fell by a third, from 5,655 to 3,700, over the same period.</p> <p>Modern foreign languages are increasingly seen as elitist, kept alive by the independent sector and selective grammar or specialist language colleges in the state sector, says Fiona Harris, the multilingual officer at the EU's offices in London. 'Already some meetings are being cancelled because they haven't got interpreters,' she says. 'It's not all doom and gloom because we are seeing an increased take-up of Mandarin and Arabic, but that doesn't help us because we need people speaking English, French and German, the three procedural languages.'</p> <p>UK graduates who do have a command of French and German are not always suitable to work as interpreters because of their poor knowledge of English grammar and wide use of slang, says Brian Fox, the EU's director of interpretation. 'Many of the youngsters coming in now speak as if they were talking to their friends when they should be moving up a register. Their command of the English language isn't there any more,' he warns.</p>",
  "<p>Keith Vaz, the influential Labour MP, is facing pressure to step down as chairman of the home affairs select committee following claims that he wrongly intervened in a court case on behalf of a firm run by a close associate. </p> <p>The MP for Leicester East wrote to the High Court allegedly urging a delay in proceedings in a case that involved a friend from whom he and his family had received hospitality. </p> <p>One committee member said that he should step down until he has cleared his name. 'The allegations against Keith are so serious that he is in effect casting a shadow over the committee as a whole. It can't go on.'</p> <p>Tory frontbencher Chris Grayling said: 'If he has broken the rules, his position as chairman will be pretty much untenable.'</p> <p>Vaz, 51, wrote to the judge in June urging the High Court to delay proceedings involving solicitor Shahrokh Mireskandari, who was challenging a court order to pay \u00a3400,000 in costs to the liquidator of an airline. Vaz asked for the case to be suspended pending an outcome of a complaint about how the case had been previously handled.</p> <p>The letter failed to mention Vaz's relationship with Mireskandari, the solicitor at the heart of several high-profile discrimination cases against the Metropolitan Police. The pair have often socialised together, and Vaz and his wife have accepted hospitality from the Iranian-born solicitor at Wembley Stadium and the 02 Arena. Vaz also delivered the eulogy at the funeral of Mireskandari's mother. </p> <p>In response to the allegations, Vaz claimed that he had written to the court in a joint letter with Virendra Sharma, the MP for Ealing Southall, after being contacted by Dean and Dean, Mireskandari's firm. </p> <p>Sharma told The Observer yesterday that he was 'disappointed' that Vaz failed to explain that he knew Mireskandari and Dean and Dean when they had discussed the case at length. </p> <p>'I was not told by Keith that he had a relationship with this man. If I had been told of this, it would have changed the way that I viewed this letter. He should have told me that he knew these people involved in this company. I had no knowledge of the company or Keith's relationship with it or the individuals involved in it,' he said. </p> <p>Sharma said that he had received a letter from Dean and Dean over the summer which made allegations of racism against a court official. He then discussed the letter with the MP for Leicester East. Vaz, a trained barrister, offered to draw up another letter to be sent to the High Court that they would jointly sign and send off, asking for 'clarification' on the allegations, he said. </p> <p>'I don't remember who first brought up this letter from Dean and Dean, whether it was me or Keith. I will be speaking to Keith to find out what happened. I have known him for many years,' he said.</p> <p>Sharma, who was elected in July 2007, said that he may have made a mistake in signing the letter. 'I am a new MP. I will be more questioning before I sign a letter in future,' he said.</p> <p>The letter received short shrift from the judge, Justice Coulson. He dismissed the appeal from Dean and Dean and said that the company owed \u00a3400,000. Mireskandari is personally liable for \u00a3265,000, according to reports. </p> <p>It is the second time that Vaz has been accused of interfering on behalf of Mireskandari, who has represented Commander Ali Dizaei and Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur. Vaz had previously written to the Solicitors Regulation Authority outlining allegations of discrimination and prejudice he had received from a 'Dr S Mireskandari'.</p> <p>This newspaper revealed last week that Vaz introduced Mireskandari, 47, to members of the select committee when they travelled to Moscow in May and attended meetings with Russian ministers. Members of the home affairs select committee said they were puzzled as to why an Iranian-born solicitor was involved in meetings with the Russian deputy prime minister. </p> <p>Ann Cryer, the Labour MP for Keighley, said: 'There was this man there. He came to the functions that we went to, but I could not work out who he was.' </p> <p>Vaz was suspended from the House of Commons for a month in 2002 after a standards and privileges committee inquiry found that he had made false allegations against Eileen Eggington, a former policewoman. Repeated attempts were made to contact Vaz yesterday by telephone and email but he failed to respond. Mireskandari could not be contacted on his usual telephone number.</p>"
