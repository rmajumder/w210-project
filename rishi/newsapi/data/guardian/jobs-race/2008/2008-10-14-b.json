  "<p>All credit to the Guardian for giving a higher profile to Black History Month (Black history timeline, October 13-17). I hope it stimulates further attention and debate - what has been missed and what should be added chief among them. My nomination for key figures is Thurgood Marshall, special counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People - which celebrates its centenary next year - and director-counsel of the NAACP's legal defence fund from 1940-61. During those years, Marshall chiselled away at the legal foundations of segregation, culminating in the landmark 1954 Brown v Board of Education school desegregation case. In 1967, he was appointed the first black US supreme court justice by President Johnson. Without Marshall and the defence fund's work, Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement may not have emerged when and as successfully as they did.<br><strong>Professor John Kirk</strong><br>Royal Holloway, University of London </p> <p>I am delighted with the Black History Month initiative, both online and in the newspaper. However, I am deeply disappointed with the quality of the posters. They are in stark contrast to the glossy kind that were freely distributed on shells, reptiles, butterflies etc. Why are you now asking that we fork out \u00a315 for this ground-breaking series? Where is the equality in this? Please have a rethink.<br><strong>Elizabeth Anionwu</strong><br>London </p> <p>Yes, Claudia Jones, who is included in Royal Mail's new stamps, was a socialist (Six women honoured, October 14), but a socialist of a special kind. She was a member of the national committee of the Communist party of the USA and was imprisoned four times and eventually deported and given asylum in Britain, where she promptly joined our CP. Her communist politics underlay all her activities on behalf of black people.<br><strong>Chris Birch</strong><br>London</p>",
  "<p>Balram Halwai, narrator of The White Tiger, is not going to let a lack of education keep him in the dark. He is heading for glory in India's bright future. He will be one of those who stuffs cash into brown envelopes for policemen and politicians, and not just another victim.</p> <p>Aravind Adiga's first novel is couched as a cocksure confession from a deceitful, murderous philosopher runt who has the brass neck to question his lowly place in the order of things. </p> <p>His disrespect for his elders and betters is shocking - even Mahatma Gandhi gets the lash of his scornful tongue. </p> <p>Balram has worked out early in life that good deeds usually have awful consequences. This is because he, along with most lowly Indians, inhabits the Darkness, a place where basic necessities are routinely snatched by the wealthy, who live in the Light.</p> <p>He gets a lucky break when he learns to handle a car, then lands a job as driver for a landlord from his village. He has the voice of what may, or may not, be a new India: quick-witted, half-baked, self-mocking, and quick to seize an advantage. He happily abuses religious foibles and hatreds of others where it suits, dispatching a rival driver to destitution via a little anti-Muslim prejudice. </p> <p>There is much to commend in this novel, a witty parable of India's changing society, yet there is much to ponder. The scales have fallen from the eyes of some Indian writers, many either living abroad, or educated there like Adiga. </p> <p>The home country is invariably presented as a place of brutal injustice and sordid corruption, one in which the poor are always dispossessed and victimised by their age-old enemies, the rich. Characters at the colourful extremities of society are Dickensian grotesques, Phiz sketches, adrift in a country that is lurching rapidly towards bland middle-class normality.</p> <p>My hunch is this is fundamentally an outsider's view and a superficial one. There are so many alternative Indias, uncontacted and unheard. Adiga is an interesting talent. I hope he will immerse himself deeper in that country, then go on to greater things.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> This is an edited extract from the Guardian's review of The White Tiger, which was published in April</p>",
  "<p>After an \"emotionally draining\" and closely fought final judging session, Aravind Adiga, one of the two debut novelists on the Man Booker shortlist, was last night awarded the \u00a350,000 prize for The White Tiger, a bracingly modern novel about the dark side of the new India.</p> <p>Adiga, 33, is a surprise winner: at long odds he batted aside the claims of veteran writers on the shortlist such as Sebastian Barry and Amitav Ghosh.</p> <p>He is only the fourth first time novelist to win the prize, after Keri Hulme in 1985, Arundhati Roy in 1997 and DBC Pierre in 2003 - and he is the second youngest after Ben Okri, who won in 1991 aged 32.</p> <p>Michael Portillo, the chair of the judges, talked of a final panel meeting characterised by \"passionate debate\". Adiga's book won by a \"sufficient\", but by no means unanimous, margin.</p> <p>\"It was pretty close,\" said Portillo, and in the last stages it was down to a battle between The White Tiger and one other book.</p> <p>The White Tiger takes a sharp and unblinking look at the reality of India's economic miracle. Its antihero and narrator, Balram Halwai, is a cocksure, uneducated young man, the son of an impoverished rickshaw driver. By lying, betraying and using his sharp intelligence, Balram makes his ascent into the heady heights of Bangalore's big business.</p> <p>The writing of the novel, said Adiga, had come out of his career as a journalist, and his encounters - as a relatively privileged middle-class man - with members of India's underclass.</p> <p>\"Class is a boring topic to write about. Big divides are not what people are interested in. But it's the most pressing concern - because other things spring out of it, like terrorism and instability,\" he said. \"The book has done very well in India - and there is a need for books like this.</p> <p>\"Something extraordinary is happening between the rich and the poor. Once, there was at least a common culture between rich and poor, but that has been eroded, and people have noted that.\"</p> <p>Asked what he would do with the money, he said: \"The first thing is to find a bank I can put it in.\"</p> <p>Portillo said that Adiga \"undertakes an extraordinary task - he gains and holds the attention of the reader for a hero who is a thoroughgoing villain\".</p> <p>He also praised the work's attention to \"important social issues: the division between rich and poor, and issues on a global scale. And it is extremely readable.\" The main criterion for the prize, he said, was: \"Does this book knock my socks off? And this did.\"</p> <p>The feeling among the judges, Portillo said, was that \"here was a book on the cutting edge, dealing with a different aspect of India, unfamiliar perhaps to many readers. What set it apart was its originality. The feeling was that this was new territory.\"</p> <p>Portillo likened the novel to Macbeth. \"It is about ambition realised through murder,\" he said, \"but with a delicious twist. Whereas Lady Macbeth and Macbeth are driven mad by their crime, the hero of this book is only driven mad by the fact that he hesitated and might not have committed his crime.\"</p> <p>The novel takes the form of seven letters addressed by Balram to the Chinese premier on the eve of a state visit, and its tone is almost Dickensian, as the unpleasant reality of contemporary Indian society is revealed via mordant sketches of characters, from millionaires in their air-conditioned tower blocks to the unfortunates who are trapped in poverty and who live literally below them, catering to their every whim.</p> <p>Kevin Rushby, reviewing the book for the Guardian, called it \"a witty parable of India's changing society\".</p> <p>Adiga was born in Chennai in 1974 and was raised partly in Australia. Having studied at Columbia and Oxford universities, he became a journalist, and has written for Time magazine and many British newspapers. He lives in Mumbai.</p> <p>The other authors on the shortlist were Philip Hensher for The Northern Clemency, Steve Toltz for A Fraction of the Whole, and Linda Grant for The Clothes on Their Backs.</p> <p>The other judges were Alex Clark, critic and editor of Granta; the novelist Louise Doughty; James Heneage, the founder of Ottakar's bookshops; and Hardeep Singh Kohli, the broadcaster. </p> <h2>Extract</h2> <p>Now, I no longer watch Hindi films - on principle - but back in the days when I used to, just before the movie got started, either the number 786 would flash against the black screen - the Muslims think this is a magic number that represents their god - or else you would see the picture of a woman in a white sari with gold sovereigns dripping down to her feet, which is the goddess Lakhshmi, of the Hindus.</p> <p>It is an ancient and veneratedcustom of people in my country to start a story by praying to a Higher Power. I guess, Your Excellency, that I too should start off by kissing some god's arse.</p> <p>Which god's arse, though? There are so many choices. </p> <p>See the Muslims have one god. The Christians have three gods. And we Hindus have 36,000,000 gods.</p> <p>Making a grand total of 36,000,004 divine arses for me to choose from.</p> <p>Now there are some, and I don't just mean Communists like you, but thinking men of all political parties, who think that not many of these gods actually exist.</p> <p>Some believe that none of them exist. There's just us and an ocean of darkness around us. I'm no philosopher or poet, how would I know the truth? It's true that all these gods seem to do awfully little work - much like our politicians - and yet keep winning re-election to their golden thrones in heaven, year after year.</p>",
  "<p>Yes, I had money in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008/oct/07/banks.savings\">IceSave</a>. And, as I search around to find someone to blame other than my own judgment, the Icelandic government and of course the global financial crisis, I can't help but think that their website had something to do with it. It's so slick, is the thing. The design is clean and clear, with the white spaces and rainbow-coloured single word logo so comfortingly reminiscent of everyone's online friend, Google. The site has fast response times and is laid out intuitively, with a helpful and extensive list of <a href=\"https://online.icesave.co.uk/OFIS/related/common.htm\">FAQs</a> and an easy to find Contact Us button which leads to <a href=\"http://www.icesave.co.uk/contact-us.html\">an actual telephone number</a>, rather than funnelling me to an online feedback system. Yes, IceSave's website is a model of customer-friendly design; it's a pity they don't have any money left.<br> It's rather embarrassing to realise that I was so swayed by site design. After all, I've been spotting online imposters, with the help of <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/\">Snopes</a>, for more than a decade now. <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/nothing/billgate.asp\">Bill Gates will give money to charity</a> if I forward this email? Don't make me laugh. You need me to <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/fraud/phishing/phishing.asp\">update my pin</a> due to identity theft? Pull the other one. <br> Add to this that the web-savvy reader or consumer is constantly being told to withhold trust. We all know that the person we're talking to online might not actually look like the picture they've posted of themselves \u2013 even if their aim isn't <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_fraud#Dating_scams\">out and out fraud</a>. And <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008/oct/01/scamsandfraud.consumeraffairs\">phishing scams are steadily increasing</a>. One really ought to know by now not to use online presence as a guide to trustworthiness.<br> I have more reason than most to know that all that glisters online certainly isn't gold. For nearly three years, I was lead writer on alternate reality game <a href=\"http://www.perplexcity.com/\">Perplex City</a>, an online narrative which tried <a href=\"http://wayback.perplexcitystories.com/?url=www.perplexcitysentinel.com&amp;season=1\">as hard as possible</a> to <a href=\"http://wayback.perplexcitystories.com/?url=www.perplexcityrail.com/index.php&amp;season=1\">look real</a>. We occasionally succeeded too well. For our wrap party, we wanted to order some M&amp;Ms printed with the logo of a drug we'd invented, <a href=\"http://wayback.perplexcitystories.com/?url=www.cognivia.com/products/ceretin/\">Ceretin, a \"cognitive enhancer\"</a>. We had a call back from Mars after we'd placed the order, though. M&amp;Ms have a rule that they won't custom print their chocolates with the name of any drug; having checked <a href=\"http://wayback.perplexcitystories.com/?url=www.cognivia.com&amp;season=1\">our entirely fictional pharmaceuticals website</a>, they'd concluded that Ceretin was a real product and thus on their banned list. On the internet, it's all too easy to look like something you're not.<br> So I suppose, although it's entirely irrational, I'll be shying away from financial institutions with beautiful websites for a while. I'm starting to notice a trend, actually. <a href=\"http://www.northernrock.co.uk/\">Northern Rock's site</a> is pretty attractive in a white-on-black <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/images/2008/01/15/img_9293.jpg\">Steve Jobs presentation way</a>. Kaupthing Edge, as well as having a name that sounds like a midtown NYC extreme sports shop, has a funky bubble effect going on in the <a href=\"http://www.kaupthingedge.co.uk/\">background of its site</a> rather reminiscent of <a href=\"http://www.o2.co.uk/business/sme/whyo2forbusiness/whyshouldyouchooseo2?cm_re=BusinessArea-_-SMEbox2-_-Whyo2ForBusiness\">O2</a>. IceSave's design makes other institutions like <a href=\"https://www.mybank.alliance-leicester.co.uk/index.asp?ct=mybankrhnlogin&amp;\">Alliance &amp; Leicester</a> or <a href=\"http://www.nationwide.co.uk/\">Nationwide</a> look clunky and old fashioned. But then, Alliance &amp; Leicester and Nationwide haven't gone bust. Perhaps, in this era of decreased trust all round, ugly website design is going to stage a resurgence.</p>",
  "<p>Sky Sports presenter Jeff Stelling and actor Alexander Armstrong are understood to be in the running to become the new Countdown host.</p> <p>Stelling, the long-serving host of Sky Sport's Soccer Saturday football results marathon, could become the fourth presenter in the 26-year history of the Channel 4 daytime words and numbers quiz. </p> <p>Insiders told the Sun today that they were confident of signing the presenter to replace Des O'Connor, who announced he was leaving earlier this year.</p> <p>Stelling was linked to the Channel 4 programme after original host Richard Whitley died in 2005, but the job went to Des Lynam.</p> <p>A source connected with the programme confirmed that Stelling was in the frame, and that the other contender for the job, Armstrong, was screen tested last week.</p> <p>Armstrong was screen tested on the strength of his appearance as guest host on Have I Got News for You. </p> <p>His credits include Channel 4 sketch show Armstrong and Miller, ITV drama Life Begins and the recent BBC1 comedy drama Mutual Friends.
