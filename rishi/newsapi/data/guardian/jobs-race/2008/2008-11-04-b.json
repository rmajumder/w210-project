Unlike the battleground states of Ohio, Florida and others, Texas is safe and secure Republican country. John McCain, whatever happens elsewhere, can count on Texas to vote for him.</p> <p>He could also count on Joseph Englan, 26, who worked for a local services company. \"I voted Republican. It is all about the taxes. If Obama wins he will tax my company more and then they will take it out of my wages,\" said Englan. He added that his firm had held meetings to discuss the election and that the prospect of higher taxes had come. \"We had talks about it at work. The economy is what matters now. We can't afford to be raising taxes,\" he said.</p> <p>But Beaumont and Jefferson County is not typical Texas country. The city is a working port and has a large black population. It also has a growing Hispanic community. Both demographics, especially blacks, have a strong leaning towards Obama. In 2004, John Kerry narrowly won the county by 51% to 49% even as George Bush easily won Texas. Bush held Texas by a crushing 61% to Kerry's 38%.</p> <p>In black neighbourhoods in Beaumont, the turnout was slow but organizers said that reflected a huge amount of early voting.</p> <p>In the inner city around a polling station on Ewing Street, scattered groups of black voters walked through morning sunshine to get to a polling station in a local church. Among them was father and son Larry and Walter Rideaux. They had voted for Obama and smiled in the late summer heat. \"It is important to vote for him. He's the best candidate. He's intelligent and hopefully he will be able to get us out of this mess,\" said Larry Rideaux.</p> <p>His father agreed, adding that while he thought Obama was simply a better candidate than McCain, there was also a feeling of pride in casting a vote that could put the first-ever black president into the White House. \"There's no denying that. It shows us how far America has come. It shows that America is where it should be right now,\" Walter Rideaux said.</p> <p>In fact, there was such wild optimism among some black voters that a few predicted Obama could even win Texas even though such a vote swing is virtually impossible to seriously imagine.</p> <p>\"You never know. He might do it. There is a going to be a huge turnout among African Americans,\" said Larry Rideaux. That is not likely. McCain will still win Texas. But the rest of the country could be a different matter.</p>",
  "<p>Tehran taxi drivers might not know where the US embassy used to be, especially if they weren't around when the Islamic Revolution took place in 1979. But ask for the \"nest of spies\" and they will head as fast as the permanently gridlocked traffic allows to Taleghani Avenue, where slogans and murals on a long brick wall proclaim a historic victory over \"global arrogance\".</p> <p>Americans remember the compound as the scene where their diplomats were held hostage for 444 days until finally being freed in January 1981 as a gesture to Ronald Reagan, the incoming Republican president. </p> <p>Reagan's predecessor, Jimmy Carter - the Democrat who had urged Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to make concessions to the opposition - ended his term with another stinging humiliation from the man who removed Pahlavi from the Peacock Throne, Ayatollah Khomeini.</p> <p>It was a coincidence that this year's anniversary of the storming of the embassy yesterday fell so close to the American presidential election, providing a vivid and timely reminder of the tortured relationship between the US and Iran .</p> <p>The speeches to mark the anniversary from the podium outside what was once called Roosevelt gate were predictably fiery. Familiar slogans - \"Death to America\" \"Death to Israel\" and \"Death to Zionism\" - were chanted in Farsi, Arabic and finally English to ensure maximum impact. Young Basij volunteers in camouflage gear and green Imam Hussein headbands sang sweetly of sacrifice and martyrdom. War veterans in wheelchairs were given place of honour on carpets rolled out in the street.</p> <p>Iranians say that the turnout at such set-piece official events is in decline and only kept up by bussing in soldiers, militiamen and children who are given the day off school to carry placards, wave banners, and burn the odd flag. The embassy rally has the ritualistic, symbolic quality of something that is done because it has been done for years, not because it means that much any more.</p> <p>Massoud, a 15-year-old Tehran schoolboy, posed happily with a \"Death to the USA\" poster, oblivious to the irony of his Colorado Rockies sweatshirt, jeans and trainers. \"I hate the US government, not the people,\" he explained. \"And especially not those who love justice and don't want to dominate the world.\"</p> <p>Only the teenage girls, some in black chadors though many with headscarves draped loosely over carefully-arranged hair, looked any different from their American counterparts.</p> <p>\"If the US embassy re-opened and started issuing visas to Iranians again, a lot of these people would be queuing up to get one,\" quipped Hussein, a teacher and trenchant critic of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. </p> <p>\"Many of my friends are thinking of leaving the country if they can because they are so unhappy with the way the government is running things.\"</p> <p>Officially, there is little interest here in the outcome of the US election. Ayatollah Khamenei, the supreme leader, has spoken of \"deep-seated differences\" between the two countries, apparently seeking to squash speculation about any sudden change, or at least ensuring that he will control it if there is. </p> <p>\"Obama and McCain have differences over tactics, not strategy,\" argued Hamidreza Taraghi of the Islamic Coalition party, an Ahmadinejad ally. \"Anyway they are both sponsored by the Zionists so we can't expect they won't be influenced by them.\"</p> <p>Jamal, a middle-aged driver, wanted to see John McCain in the White House because \"he will attack Iran and set us free\". Yet he also wants Iran to develop nuclear weapons (the government insists, to widespread scepticism abroad, that its only motive in developing nuclear technology is to generate power). \"We are threatened by the US and Israel. If the Jews have the atomic bomb, why shouldn't we?\"</p> <p>Voices in the reformist camp are more nuanced about the prospects of an Obama win. Hossein Adeli, head of the Ravand Foundation, the country's only non-official NGO, predicts that positive gestures from Washington will be met by greater Iranian cooperation over Iraq and Afghanistan. \"If Obama wants to change the image of America in the world Iran is one area were he can demonstrate it,\" he said. \"It would give him the edge over his predecessors.\"</p> <p>With so much at stake it is natural that the world is focused on the drama of the race for the White House. But, the Iranian reformists suggest, it may be that their own presidential election next June will prove almost as crucial. </p> <p>Ahmadinejad's rhetoric about Israel and the Holocaust - the latter at least an embarrassment to many here - will likely be a serious barrier to any rapprochement. But if Obama makes it to the Oval Office he could expect to find an easier interlocutor in Mohamed Khatemi, the former president who oversaw a partial thaw in US-Iranian relations until George Bush's \"axis of evil\" speech and the subsequent focus on Iran's nuclear ambitions. Reformists hope Khatemi will stand again, pointing to reliable polling that shows his popularity ratings more than double those of Ahmadinejad.</p> <p>But it is highly uncertain whether he will stand, and unlikely that he or any other reformist could actually win.</p> <p>\"For Iranians, the election in the US is not important,\" said Mohammed Ali Abtahi, a cleric and former vice-president under Khatemi. \"What is important is what happens here.\"</p> <p>Farnaz, a 22-year-old animator, was born years after the drama of Tehran's \"nest of spies\" and barely glances at the angry slogans on Taleghani Avenue. Farnaz prefers Obama to McCain or Bush. But for her, too, Iran's biggest problems lie closer to home - and their solution in the hands of her compatriots. \"If Ahmadinejad goes and is replaced by someone else,\" she smiled, \"then I'm sure things can get better here.\"</p>",

  "<p>It was already going to be an exciting week for black communities across the world, but when a team of West Indian cricketers won the Stanford cricket match, and then, 10 seconds before the finish line, Lewis Hamilton made his move on Timo Glock, Dotun Adebayo, presenting his BBC London radio show, couldn't help himself. Would this be, he asked, \"the beginning of the greatest week ever in black history\"?</p> <p>The issue of role models is, of course, a perennial debate within and outside the black community - who are they? And where are they, when they are so urgently needed? Will this week prove a kind of tipping point? Simon Woolley, director and co-founder of Operation Black Vote, who was a guest on Adebayo's show, sincerely hopes so - and believes he has reason to. For one thing, he is emotionally exhausted by the drama of Hamilton's win - because, \"it's like watching your child race, such an emotional rollercoaster - that's the emotional investment we've got\". For him, and everybody else who recognised themselves in the young mixed-race man from Stevenage, the win was particularly piquant because, \"it's about winning against adversity. Yes, because he's a young black man we're proud. But we've watched him face the most wretched racist abuse. Our journey to sucess is always peppered by obstacles of racism. So when we do succeed, particularly with great dignity ... \"</p> <p>For another, he has been seeing the effect of Obama's candidacy, from day to day, and is bowled over by it. A couple of weeks ago, he ran an event in Brixton, called Equanomics, a project that looks at political and economic empowerment for black communities. \"We would have been happy if 50 showed up - but we got 300, many under 25. Look, we've got a black man who could be the most powerful person in the world. He's speaking our language, he looks like us - our organisation is riding the crest of an Obama wave. It's the dawn of a new era.\" </p> <p>For nine months, Operation Black Vote has been running a political mentoring scheme they have been calling the Barack Obama Generation, in which established politicians, mostly in the Welsh Assembly, have agreed to mentor young political hopefuls from minorities. Nine people stepped up, and three - all political novices - are already in positions where they might be elected: Mari Rees has been selected as a Labour candidate for the winnable seat of Pembrokeshire (if she won, she would be the first black politician to be elected in Wales); Elizabeth Musa has been nominated to stand for election to the Welsh Assembly in four years' time; and Shazia Awan has been shortlisted for a Tory seat.</p> <p>But the effect need not be this direct. \"The thing about Lewis Hamilton, and to a big extent Barack Obama,\" says Diane Abbott, MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, \"is that they are running counter to stereotype. They're not sportsmen - obviously formula one motor racing is a sport, but it's not a physical sport. There's this idea that black men have physical prowess, which is not, in itself, unremarkable. Where it's about how fast you can run and how strong you are, you will get black champions. What is interesting about Hamilton, and to a lesser extent Tiger Woods, is that we're talking now about very cerebral sports.\" </p> <p>She has also been interested to see, in the US media, mentions of African-American men \"generally carrying themselves with more pride. Because you've got this black man who could become president, and in any event has been centre-stage in this campaign. I think it does have an effect - we're in a society, both in America and Britain, where black men are demonised and vilified. I mean most weeks you can pick up a newspaper and unless they're a sportsman it means they've killed someone or they're mad. So it's a very good thing to see a positive image of a black man. And more important, in a way, with Barack Obama, a black family. For Americans, the </p> <p>First family is a bit like the royal family for us. So with Barack we're going to have a black family that's a symbol of nationhood, and I think that's quite profound.\"</p> <p>Woolley agrees with this, too. \"On a very basic level, on a daily basis, we see ourselves portrayed in the media as villains. But we can look at this dynamic young black kid, and think, with a bit of luck my child could follow in his success.\" Woolley's partner is Spanish, so they have mixed-race children, and looking at Hamilton and Obama, \"we can say to our children - they look like you. Unless you've got a black child or a mixed-race child the profundity of having such role models would be difficult to grasp.\" </p> <p>Which is all true, but others caution that their achievements are so huge, and so specific and arcane, that the effect, while galvanising in a general sort of way, may not trickle down to, say, a teenager struggling with her GCSEs in Leeds. As Michael Eboda, who for years was editor of the New Nation newspaper, and is now CEO of Powerful Media, which has just published a list of Britain's 100 most influential black people, points out, \"You have to have a particular set of circumstances to do what Hamilton has done: you have to be quite small, be able to raise a lot of money, and be ultra-talented - most kids know that's not what they're going to be.\" </p> <p>He argues that if what Lewis and Obama have done inspires other people, that's brilliant, \"but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that there are lots of other people who are a lot more accessible.\" He often takes the list into schools, and shows it to young black men, in particular. </p> <p>Stereotypes come in all shapes and sizes, and so people assume, for example, the black \"youth\" would be particularly interested in footballers or rappers. But there are only two sportsmen on it. \"They're far, far, far more impressed by a guy like Michael Prest, one of our panellists, whose business turns over a billion a year. They find that far more impressive. It's what they really want to do - a lot of them are interested in music and stuff but a hell of lot of them say they want to be a CEO, or run a company. Or they say they want to be a lawyer, a doctor. You meet the odd one who wants to be a footballer. But they know that either you're good at it or you're not.\" They're interested in Tidjane Thiam, the group finance director for Prudential, who's being groomed to be CEO; they're interested in the most influential person on the list, Dr Mo Ibrahim, who started off working at BT, set up his own company, sold it for for $3.4bn, and now runs a foundation dedicated to promoting good governance in Africa - these they see as possible paths. As for Obama in particular, \"I think we kind of have to look at ourselves and say what are we doing over here? There are a lot of people in very powerful positions here, and they're the ones we in Britain have to look to. I'm not a great fan always looking at America.\" </p> <p>And in the end, the ideal, the hope, is that something more complex and much greater can be achieved; that what the British actor and playwright Kwame Kwei-Armah calls \"a new narrative\" can begin. \"In the past I have been reluctant to accept the mantle of role model but whether you accept it or not, you are,\" says Patricia Scotland, Baroness Scotland of Asthal and now attorney general for England and Wales. In 1991, she became the youngest person to take silk since William Pitt the Younger, and the first black woman to be made a QC. She says she was particularly moved during that year by a father who told her that his nine-year-old daughter had clipped a picture of her out of a newspaper and announced: \"I'm going to do that.\" She now has a degree in law and has been called to the bar. She doesn't tell me what colour this nine-year-old was because, for her, that is not the only point. </p> <p>Of course there is a long way to go, and the website that received a barrage of racist taunts about Hamilton is yet another example. \"But,\" says Baroness Scotland, \"I would say to all young people, not just black young people, 'You can achieve!' Irrespective of your background, your ethnicity, you faith, or your sexual orientation. I think it's a good time for people and not just black people. It's very important for all our children of whatever colour and whatever faith to try and see individuals as that - as individuals who have huge potential to achieve. And I would love us to finally get to the stage when each of our children will look at their own talents as being the final arbiter of what they will do, and not an outward manifestation, or a sexual or other orientation. So they won't say I can't do this, because I am white, or black, or Jewish or Christian or Muslim, or I'm gay or I am straight. That they are able just to say, I am a person of talent. We need to create an environment where that talent is released.\" And to that we can only say amen.</p> <h2>'If Obama gets in, I'm moving to America'</h2> <p><strong>Young black British men on the role models that give them hope</strong></p> <p><strong>Anthony Lawrence, 20, student</strong></p> <p>To know that there might be a black president and to see Hamilton winning makes me feel happy inside, man, because I'm black. There aren't enough role models for the younger generation. Me, I never had a father, and my mum died when I was young. I never had anyone except for my grandma. I wouldn't listen to her, I was always on the street doing what I wanted to do. As soon as Barack Obama came on the scene, I listened to everything he says. He speaks to me, he makes me think that there is another way out of this wartorn world. One of my friends died the other day. He got stabbed. He was 16. I cried, man. It made me feel like I'm the next one to go. </p> <p><strong>Peter Okeowo, 22, student</strong></p> <p>I was watching the race, and I thought Lewis was going to lose - when he won I was really relieved. I felt so proud. He did well despite criticism and I was really happy for him. Now </p> <p>I want Obama to win. I was discussing with my friends whether one day in this country will we have a black prime minister. Most people were saying never. But hopefully it will happen. </p> <p><strong>Moboshir Ali, 19, currently looking for work</strong></p> <p>Lewis Hamilton? Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant. Now he's in the history books. It was so good. I don't care about Obama, though. I give up on politics. I really don't think it will change my life. Politicians don't represent me. I can't do grand-prix racing because I'm no good at driving, but maybe I will get into IT.</p> <p><strong>Joshua Ellison, 17, student</strong></p> <p>Hackney is my hometown, it's easy to blend in - but if Obama gets in, I'm moving to America, bwoy! I'm excited about Lewis Hamilton, too, and really happy for him. If there are black people achieving, it's there in the history books and will live on and on.</p> <p>I want to move to America where there are more opportunities. We all talk about it in class. Some of the kids I know, all they talk about is guns, and if they have someone to look up to, it gives them another option. </p> <p><strong>Duane Mayers, 20, chef</strong></p> <p>It would be great to have a black president. He's grown up the way we've grown up. I've heard about his background and family. He's had that childhood and knows how we live so he will know how to change that. Lewis Hamilton is all right but not such a role model as Obama. </p> <p><strong>Kenny Julian, 18, student</strong></p> <p>I'm not a politics person but it's good to give black people a shot at being president. Give them a chance to prove themselves. </p> <p><strong>Sile Entee, 21, student</strong></p> <p>It's hopeful, but if he turns president, they're going to assassinate him. America's going to have a civil war.</p> <p><strong>Michael Morris, 24, student</strong></p> <p>I rate Barack Obama. He's stronger than the other people. Lewis Hamilton? I rate him too. I'm Jamaican and English, mixed-race. I'm proud to have those mixed-race role models.</p> <p><strong>Rennal Edwards, 15, school student</strong></p> <p>Lewis and Obama, although they're doing different jobs, they're linked. They must both have struggled to be where they are. They've shown it is possible - that dreams do come true.</p> <p>Obama's already shown how we've got a much more modern society, a multicultural society that allows everyone to have an opportunity to be in power, not just one race. And to rule America - that's pretty significant. It means a lot to the world, and to me. The States tends to be followed by the rest of the world. They've let people come into America from all backgrounds and show that they can do well, not just in politics but in all sorts of things, in everything.</p> <p>Lewis Hamilton, now - he's come from not such a high-status background, which makes him a really good role model for people such as myself. I'm going through the experiences he went though when he was a kid. Their success will cut down a lot on racism in the world. Obama, especially, has shown us the way to a better place.</p> <p><strong>Arron Thompson, 16, school student</strong></p> <p>Great to see Lewis Hamilton in the headlines. It'll be a shame if Obama doesn't get there - he's gone so far. His mum's white, maybe that helps. Maybe it helps stop white people getting jealous.</p> <p><strong>Julius Soares, 19, engineering student</strong></p> <p>A black man being president! It makes me feel that in the future I can be whatever I want to be. He's inspired me, definitely. Obama really will make a difference if he becomes president. The fact that his mum's white makes no difference. He's black and he says he's black and that's how it is. Lewis Hamilton too, he also shows that if you just believe, you can achieve whatever you want to achieve. He said that he believed, and that was what counts.<br><strong>Interviews by Anita Sethi and Martin Wainwright</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The inside track: Gemma Briggs speaks to the people behind Lewis Hamilton's success <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/sport\">theguardian.com/sport</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday November 6 2008.

  "<p>Jimmy Carl Black, who has died of cancer aged 70, was drummer and sometimes lead vocalist with Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention between 1965 and the group's bitter break-up in 1970. The Mothers created concerts and albums that mixed pop-Dada, 1950s doo-wop, jazz, schmaltz, Stravinsky, Var\u00e8se and Webern. Black was to the fore as Lonesome Cowboy Burt, a highlight of Zappa's 200 Motels movie (1971). He was the man who introduced himself as \"the Indian of the group\" on the band's album, We're Only in It for the Money (1968), and was a central figure in If We'd All Been Living in California, a dialogue on corporate finances on Uncle Meat (1969).</p> <p>Black, who inherited Cheyenne blood from his mother, was born in El Paso, Texas, but grew up in nearby Anthony on the New Mexican border. He was a soloist in his high school band's brass section, \"but I realised that there was no chance in rock'n'roll for a trumpeter, after Elvis Presley appeared at El Paso Coliseum in 1955. When I saw the effect he had on those women, I thought, 'Man. That's what I want to do!'\"</p> <p>Though he could strum a guitar and had had piano lessons, Black bought a drum kit and practised by playing along mostly to black rhythm and blues records. While serving in the US air force, he joined a country and western trio, Them Three Guys, and, following demobilisation in 1958, played mainstream pop with the Surfs and then the Keys - with whom Black recorded Stretch Pants (1962).</p> <p>Two years later, he moved to Los Angeles, and formed the Soul Giants, who played LA dance halls. When the guitarist was drafted into the army, he was replaced by Zappa, who told the band, according to Black, that \"if you guys learn my music, I'll make you rich and famous\".</p> <p>\"He took care of half of that promise,\" said Black, \"because I'm damn sure I didn't get rich.\" Renamed the Mothers of Invention, the group followed Zappa's masterplan to a qualified prosperity via concerts and, later, albums. \"Frank made me aware of modern classical stuff,\" said Black, \"and very patiently taught me all those complex rhythms and time signatures.\"</p> <p>But Black became increasingly unhappy about Zappa's control. He resented the enlistment of a second drummer, and Zappa claiming authorship of tracks such as If We'd All Been Living in California. \"I never knew he'd taped it at a band meeting,\" he complained. \"I wasn't credited. Everything was 'written, arranged and produced by Frank Zappa'. Then a week after a successful tour, he called us together and said, 'I've decided to break up the band. Your salaries have stopped as from last week.' It was a big shock. I had five kids to feed.\"</p> <p>Postscripts to Black's tenure with Zappa embraced his role in 200 Motels, and an exhumation in 1981 of his character in it, Lonesome Cowboy Burt, for Harder Than Your Husband on Zappa's You Are What You Is album.</p> <p>In 1972 Black had success with two albums as leader of Geronimo Black, named after his youngest son. But by 1974 a Melody Maker interview was conducted in Winebel's Donuts, where he was, indeed, making doughnuts.</p> <p> He then moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, released a solo album, Clearly Classic, which achieved minimal circulation, and joined a Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band world tour.</p> <p>Black then settled in Austin, Texas, where he established the Gentlemen of Colour, a building-and-decorating business with Arthur Brown, the English star of the 1960s Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The firm flourished for 10 years - as did an artistic liaison which was to culminate in an album of R&amp;B standards, Brown, Black and Blue (1980). Black was also performing with Eugene Chadbourne - \"the free-est form guitar player I've ever met\" - and the Grandmothers, initially, former Mothers band members fronted by the Italian guitarist and Frank Zappa lookalike Sandro Oliva. Their CDs included a concert recorded in 1998 at London's Astoria theatre.</p> <p>Increasing success in Europe led Black to move to Vicenza, Italy with his then wife, a schoolteacher with the US army. After her death, he moved to Germany, home of his second wife Monika. In 1995 he began playing with the Muffin Men, the best British interpreters of the work of Zappa and Beefheart. Black was on the road with the group as recently as 2007. Assisted by Roddie Gilliard of the Muffin Men, he was working on an autobiography, For Mother's Sake.</p> <p>He is survived by Monika, three sons and two daughters.</p> <p>\u2022 James Carl Inkanish Black, drummer and singer, born February 1 1938; died November 1 2008</p>"
