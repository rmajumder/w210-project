  "<p>In the City yesterday, those who stepped out for a much-needed smoke stared moodily into space, while others avoided the television cameras that had been set up outside the Royal Exchange.</p> <p>The injection of \u00a350bn into the banks announced by the chancellor, Alistair Darling, seems to have reassured some people, but an equal number seem unimpressed. There is also the lingering worry about loss of bonuses for bank employees. Or maybe worse.</p> <p>\"Right now I'm just happy if I can keep my job, to be honest - I'm not planning for the bonus,\" said Jordan Rizov, 31, a banking executive. Rizov had worked for ABN Amro in Amsterdam for a few years and had several job offers when he came to London recently. But he still feels he needs to keep his head down and work at keeping his job, until the situation gets better.</p> <p>If Peter Fahy, headhunter for Marshall Warburton, is to be believed, the situation is not as bad as it seems: \"It's more a question of confidence at the moment, because the fundamentals are not that bad. Actually, the UK government has not responded that badly. The amount of detail and contingents [in the rescue operation] - they're not getting enough credit for it really. The decision to buy preference shares rather than a controlling stake is fairly safe for taxpayers.\"</p> <p>However, business in the UK isn't great for Marshall Warburton, and the focus could shift to emerging markets, such as the Middle East and Russia, he said.</p> <p>Which does not bode well for workers in the UK. John Doherty, 47, who works in outsourcing, said: \"I had planned to retire in about 10 years, but I'm not sure how viable that is now. Even though my mortgage situation is manageable, I'm not sure how safe my pension investments are. That has me worried.\"</p> <p>Phil Moxley, 55, of Guildford, Surrey, said: \"The people who are going to pay for it are you and me, through increased taxes and so on.\" </p> <p>Is it harsh that people who work in banking could lose their bonuses, and possibly their jobs? \"I don't think it's too harsh at all. Bonuses are given for performance, aren't they? When redundancy looms, it's the people who had the influence who end up being the victims, of course.\"</p> <p>In Edinburgh, Royal Bank of Scotland workers showed few signs of worry about the shocks that this week sent RBS shares plunging by \u00a32m a minute. Lifted by the \u00a350bn bail-out plan, some arriving at the bank's headquarters even claimed to be confident about the future. \"It's business as usual,\" said one, who did not want to be named. \"We are being reassured the bank is in a strong position ... No one's talking about job losses or budget cuts.\"</p> <p>Another had even invested several thousand pounds in RBS shares. \"You see the sheer size of this company and think it's probably a good idea,\" he said. One woman who had worked for the bank for six years said the bail-out had comforted her colleagues. \"It's a good thing - people are confident. No job worries are being discussed so I think people are safe.\"</p> <p>Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister and once an economist with RBS, was markedly upbeat. After calling for the UK government to \"fire all the guns in its locker\", he welcomed the rescue package and interest rates cut as \"substantial\" and \"very welcome\".</p> <p>But with that confidence came reticence - the Committee of Scottish Clearing Banks refused to comment - and an underlying nervousness. </p> <p>Few RBS staff would discuss the economic crisis gripping their company, nor the rumoured sacking of their chief executive, Sir Fred Goodwin. \"I'm afraid not,\" said one man in an open-necked shirt and business suit. \"Sorry, I can't,\" said another. \"Sorry, not at all,\" said her colleague, swiftly walking on.</p>",
  "<p>On September 18 drug campaign group Release held its annual conference in London. To thunderous applause, drug policy reformer and racial equality advocate Deborah Small gave a harrowing account of the plight of her fellow black Americans whose lives are caught up in the vicious interplay of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/drugsandalcohol\">drugs</a> and race wars being waged by US authorities. </p> <p>\"People say the drug war isn't working,\" she opines, \"but not me - I say it is working, only too well. It's a highly successful method of maintaining the oppression of black people in the United States.\"</p> <p>Small points to the disparities in sentencing for cocaine offences as evidence of her claims. When Congress enacted its mandatory minimum sentencing legislation, it singled out crack cocaine for especially harsh treatment; whereas possession of only 5g of crack brings a mandatory five year prison term, it takes 500g of cocaine powder to draw the equivalent. On the US drug scene, cocaine powder is the drug of choice for affluent whites, while crack is associated with urban black society. As a result, the burden of these policies has fallen overwhelmingly on African Americans. These are poor, low-level offenders, and becoming enmeshed in the criminal justice system leads them and their communities inexorably into a cycle of imprisonment, unemployment, one-parent families, political disenfranchisement, poverty and crime. </p> <p>\"The war on drugs is the continuation of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws\">Jim Crow</a> by another name,\" Small says. A long-time activist and impassioned speaker, her reference to Jim Crow evokes the bitterness of the black experience of post-civil war America, when the former Confederate southern states enacted a raft of laws named after a minstrel with blackened face whose performance mocked a stereotyped figure of the African American male. The Jim Crow laws replaced slavery with a new regime in which segregation and disenfranchisement underpinned an informal culture of brutality and lynching. Despite the promise of emancipation, once again African Americans were down by law.</p> <p>According to Small, they still are. \"When the civil rights movement succeeded in dismantling Jim Crow, the drug war took over the work of discrimination.\"</p> <p>Contemporary African Americans are three times as likely to be arrested and 10 times as likely to receive a prison sentence as white Americans. The data is stark and shocking\u2014but how does it compare with the UK? It was this intriguing question that Alex Stevens of Kent University set out to answer in his presentation as he followed Small onto the stage. She was quite an act to follow, but Stevens managed it, mainly by letting the data do the talking.</p> <p>Those on the liberal left of British politics tend to adopt a self-congratulatory tone in respect to the shameful inequalities of US drug laws and policies. The hard lesson the audience learned was the UK does not, by contrast, stand out as a shining beacon of racial equality. Instead, we heard for drug offences, black Britons are around eight times more likely to be arrested and 10 times more likely to be sent to prison than their white fellow citizens. Arguing against the possible explanation the differentials simply reflect greater drug use by black people, Stevens examined further academic research showing whites and blacks use drugs in about the same percentages and, in the case of Class A drugs, a rather greater percentage of whites use them. </p> <p>In his discussion, Stevens pointed to a number of factors which might explain the disparities. One was the greater availability of black people in the street, as they are almost five times more likely to be homeless, and nearly three times more likely to be unemployed or excluded from school. </p> <p>He also stressed the need to take into account broader questions of power and inequality in understanding the data, and it was in this analysis that he began to tread the same sort of terrain as Small. The police tend to target areas of socio-economic deprivation, and these are the areas into which black Britons have been herded by poverty and marginalisation. </p> <p>The poor and black are crucially lacking in what sociologists call \"cultural capital\"\u2014they don't have the right accents, they lack powerful connections, lawyers, the credit cards that bespeak respectability, and so on\u2014and this makes them easy targets. By contrast, Stevens invited us to recall the recent affair of Eva Rausing, wife of the Swedish billionaire's son, who was caught smuggling heroin and cocaine into the US embassy. Her husband Hans was subsequently arrested too, when allegedly a large stash of Class A drugs was found at his Chelsea home. Both were given conditional cautions.</p> <p>Such high profile cases stand in sharp relief against a background in which black Britons are routinely directed into our burgeoning prison system. They should remind us of the massive inequalities in power and wealth which structure our society and underlie the disparities in the criminal justice system, not only across the Atlantic but here, in the daily grind of Britain's own perhaps less brash but equally injurious war on drugs. </p> <p>Sebastian Saville is executive director of Release</p>"
