  "<p>\"What a miserable thing it is to die amongst women howling,\" declares the poisoned Duke Bracciano in John Webster's Jacobean revenge tragedy. What a miserable thing it is to spend close to three hours watching a production that appears to have no particular passion for this bloody splatterfest, or Webster's grimly sardonic vision of a world of lust and slaughter. The dying Flamineo, who has pandered his sister Vittoria and killed the Duke's virtuous wife, announces: \"This place is hell.\" Sadly, it is nowhere near in Jonathan Munby's dull but serviceable modern dress production, that seems to be taking place in a comfortable suburb of hell with a dry-ice machine and an excess of fake blood.</p> <p>The traverse catwalk staging that splits the auditorium in two not only limits the visual interest, but is also cruelly exposing of all but the most glittering acting. With her halo of blonde hair, Claire Price shines brightly as Vittoria, particularly when she defends herself with wit and intelligence in the play's great trial scene.</p> <p>Apart from some ill-directed death throes, Claire Cox is full of grace as the doomed Isabella. In one of the production's more imaginative moments, her ghost entwines herself with her former husband and Vittoria in their wedding dance, so that you know that there will always be three in this marriage: the guilty lovers and the murdered wife.</p> <p>But it is a sign of this production's fatal weaknesses that you relax and feel in safe hands every time Christopher Godwin's fox-like Cardinal is on stage. With much of the laughter being generated by excess and the preposterous rather than a genuine sense of fear, this is an evening that goes to the devil, rather than excavating evil.</p>",
  "<p>All viewers of The West Wing know that the back-stairs acronym for the leader of the free world is Potus but the narrator of this remarkable novel identifies herself to us as Flotus: First Lady of the United States. She's Alice Blackwell, born Lindgren, but, as writer Curtis Sittenfeld acknowledges even before the title page, she is \"inspired by the life of an American first lady\".</p> <p>Like Laura Bush, Alice, as a teenager, is driving a car which is involved in an accident that kills a male classmate. Trapped in a self-image of guilt-ridden tragedy, she is distracted by boorish Charlie Blackwell, who bowls through his life on blow-job jokes and too much booze, making him an embarrassment to his family, who are grandees of the Republican party. Alice's wisdom and loyalty eventually get him off the bottle and to the top of American politics.</p> <p>As Charlie goofs around the White House, joking about the impending merger between General Electric and Alitalia - \"They're going to call the company Genitalia!\" - the reader sees and hears George W Bush. Charlie too is elected by a Supreme Court decision. </p> <p>Yet, in other respects, this topical simulacram diverges from the biographical model: Princeton rather than Yale, money from meat rather than oil, a father who was a state governor rather than a former president.</p> <p>This combination of the looked-up and the made-up within a single narrative is a recurrent controversy of this genre of faction. Because Charlie and Alice so often exactly reflect Dubya and Laura, a tension develops when a certain detail - an abortion - is not immediately recognisable or verifiable. In a novel that will inevitably be read as a biography, there is a risk of fictional invention polluting the historical record.</p> <p>Such qualms, though, are reduced by the fact that this is such an accomplished work of fiction. Becoming far more than a Bush administration equivalent to Joe Klein's Clinton-inspired Primary Colors, this is a thoughtful and compelling examination of the mechanics of family and marriage. Numerous scenes - a family car outing, the body language of a failing marriage, the decline of an elderly relative - display a shrewd universality. A reader allergic to news could enjoy it as pure fiction.</p> <p>Sittenfeld's most impressive achievement is to imagine convincingly what it might be like for your private life to become public property. Suffering feelings of worthlessness not restricted to the automobile slaughter of her boyfriend, the narrator, purely through an accident of marriage, becomes the subject of lavish White House galas titled \"Students and Teachers Salute Alice Blackwell!\" And a once a simple morning ritual - reading the morning newspaper - becomes for Alice, in the White House, a strategic exercise in trying to reach the arts section without reading the many pieces denigrating her husband, yet taking in enough to answer, in \"a neutral tone\", his bullish inquiry: \"How'd I mess up the world today?\" While Charlie conjures up the chimpish grin of GWB, Alice is a much more subtle creation, defying the laws of narrative physics by being Laura Bush and somehow not being her. The novel turns on an act of betrayal which, though unlikely to be precisely mirrored in the present administration, is a psychologically satisfying dramatisation of how trauma from the past might shape future actions. It also encourages us to reflect on what it might be like to find that the person you loved has become the most unpopular and untrusted man in the world. Knowing and knowledgeable, yet also inventive and original, American Wife is, in an election year of unprecedented drama, a thrilling combination of history and surprises.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Lawson's Enough is Enough: Or the Emergency Government is published by Picador</p>",
  "<p>There is growing evidence that the financial meltdown is starting to take hold on the high street as a host of reports published yesterday all concluded one thing: British consumers are in for one of the toughest years in recent memory.</p> <p>Citizens Advice said the number of people seeking help after falling behind with their mortgages had soared by more than 50% in the past year. The charity also reported a steep rise in people contacting it because they were unable to keep up with payments on their fuel bills.</p> <p>After a 35% increase in gas prices this year, experts are warning that fuel bills will become the big issue this winter, not least because the number of households living in fuel poverty has risen to 5.4m.</p> <p>On top of that, there is further evidence that house prices continue to slump. The website mouseprice.com said thousands of city-centre flats had fallen heavily in price, throwing many owners into negative equity. On Thursday, the Halifax reported that house prices fell by 13.3% in the past 12 months, the biggest drop since records began 25 years ago. </p> <p>Research by the call centre firm Sitel found that around a third more workers were more concerned about job security than a month ago, and 30% of all British adults were struggling to pay bills.</p> <p>The financial website Moneyfacts said yesterday that the continued market turmoil had led more mortgage providers to withdraw their higher loan-to-value deals, putting further pressure on those trying to remortgage. \"Only 3,281 mortgage products are available today, the lowest number we have witnessed since the onslaught of the credit crunch,\" it said.</p> <p>A study to be published next week has found that consumers have already been cancelling insurance or pension contributions. The poll by uSwitch.com found that of those who had scrapped policies to cut costs, 15% had axed their car breakdown cover and 15% had dropped private health and dental insurance. A further 13% of those questioned had cancelled a life insurance policy to save money.</p> <p>There was also further proof that the \u00a350bn banks bail-out and the collapse of the Icelandic banks have left confidence in banks at an all-time low. The Spanish-owned bank Abbey said this week that about 2.3 million savers had moved their money in recent days - spooked in part by the collapse of Icelandic savings banks Icesave and Kaupthing. </p> <p>David Harker, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \"To prevent this situation worsening, it is vital that mortgage lenders and fuel companies do everything in their power to help people in arrears to come to a workable solution over repayment arrangements, rather than piling on extra charges.\"</p>",
  "<p>There is a startling disparity between the cherubic features of White Lies frontman Harry McVeigh and the sound that emerges when he opens his mouth. Imagine a horror movie in which a prepubescent choirboy, radiating innocence, becomes possessed and starts singing in a rumbling bass dredged up from five fathoms deep: that's the effect McVeigh conveys. It is instantly riveting.</p> <p>Everything about White Lies suggests this kind of theatrical contrast. Their songs inhabit the territory where goth and pop intersect: first, they conjure an atmosphere of doom from thudding drums, stomach-churning basslines and keyboard notes that swirl in the air like dry ice, then they puncture the gloom with a singalong chorus and razzle-dazzle finale. Their most upbeat song is called Death. McVeigh, who otherwise scowls and clenches his fists, claps along to this one, beaming as the synths twinkle.</p> <p>If White Lies have a weakness, it's that they stick too closely to what rapidly becomes a familiar template: their nine-song set effectively runs out of ideas halfway through. They are also prone to cliche, or else lavish so much energy on a song's chorus that the verses between feel flat (noticeably on 50 On Our Foreheads). Sometimes, too, the heightened drama of their style veers perilously close to parody, and risks becoming unintentionally hilarious.</p> <p>But then you are caught again by that demonic voice, singing knotty narratives of murder and regret, exhorting one girl to \"put down those scissors\", telling another \"I'd kill you in a second\". With just two singles released, these are early days for White Lies; they could yet fill the footsteps of Joy Division, Interpol and all their other black-clad heroes.</p> <p>\u2022 At Guildhall, Gloucester (01452 503050), November 20.

  "<p>The Rev Tim Hastie-Smith, the public school head who triggered controversy after employing a teacher who he knew had secretly filmed a pupil having sex, today dramatically left his posts as headmaster of Dean Close school and chair of an influential group of 250 leading private schools. </p> <p>A statement from the school said he was stepping down with immediate effect \"in light of recent events\". </p> <p>Hastie-Smith's decision to employ the disgraced classics teacher, a personal friend who he said deserved \"a second chance\", triggered intense controversy among some parents at the \u00a325,000-a year school in Cheltenham. </p> <p>It is also believed to be the reason why the job he was supposed to take up next year at a state-funded academy was withdrawn yesterday.</p> <p>In a statement, Hastie-Smith said: \"In light of recent events, and given that I was planning to leave the school next summer I have, after careful thought, decided that it would be better to bring forward my leaving date. Dean Close is a fine school, and it has been a privilege to serve as its headmaster for the last 10 years.\"</p> <p>Yesterday's statement released by the United Learning Trust, the sponsors of Kettering academy where he was due to take up the headship next year, said it was in the \"best interests of the school\" that he didn't.</p> <p>A source at Dean Close school told the Guardian that the row over his employment of Michael Clarkson - who was found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct and struck off the teaching register last week - had been the \"nail in the coffin\".</p> <p>Last Friday, a local newspaper reported that Hastie-Smith had employed Clarkson in full knowledge of the outstanding allegations against him. </p> <p>Clarkson, then a teacher at Shrewsbury school, had secretly filmed the pupil having sex with a girl after he had lent him his own hotel room during a 2006 school sports tour. </p> <p>Five months after the incident, Clarkson was given a part-time job at Dean Close. He left the school in July ahead of the General Teaching Council hearing last week. </p> <p>Hastie-Smith's resignation earlier today as chair of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, which represents 250 top public schools including Eton and Harrow, came as a surprise to insiders. </p> <p>A spokesman said: \"Questions were asked last week about the employment issue, but members felt it was an individual matter at an individual school. The HMC had no part in today's decisions.\"</p> <p>The subsequent announcement that he was leaving his post at the school offered an explanation: he could not have carried on as HMC chair when he was no longer head of a school. </p> <p>Only last week, Hastie-Smith addressed a high profile annual meeting of the HMC, with guests including the Earl of Wessex and the then schools minister Lord Adonis. </p> <p>His description of a moral vacuum in schools, left by the absence of religion and filled by an \"X-Factor culture\", were widely reported. </p> <p>A letter to parents at Dean Close school, seen by the Guardian, and dated last Thursday, said: \"I have known Mr Clarkson personally for over 10 years and felt strongly that he had learned from his bad mistake, as did all who knew him well, including his colleagues at Shrewsbury. </p> <p>\"Having followed every appropriate procedure, it was clear that he in no way posed a danger to children in the school.\"</p> <p>One parent at the school who contacted the Guardian earlier this week described it as an \"outrage\" and claimed they were thinking of removing their child from the school in protest. </p> <p>Hastie-Smith was unavailable for comment today.</p>",
  "<h2>Slumps and slurs</h2> <p>As the Dow Jones index plunged, the candidates continued to focus relentlessly on the economy. John McCain pushed his retooled mortgage buy-up plan, while Barack Obama mocked it and called on the US treasury to implement the bailout agreed last week \"as quickly as possible\". But yesterday was also the day that a subtext of the recent campaign - the increasingly ugly tone of supporters at Republican rallies - became something more than a subtext.</p> <p>McCain and his running-mate, Sarah Palin, continue to raise questions about the extent of Barack Obama's associations with the Weather Underground co-founder Bill Ayers, because they know it's \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/09/uselections2008.johnmccain4\"> logically impossible to prove a negative</a>,\" Daniel Nasaw writes on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com\">theguardian.com</a>. But some supporters are going further. In recent days, audience-members at McCain/Palin events have shouted \"treason!\" and \"terrorist!\" about Obama, and \"kill him!\" about either Obama or Ayers. One reportedly used a racial epithet at a black TV sound engineer, and told him to \"sit down, boy\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/oct/09/uselections2008.barackobama1\">Videos circulating on the internet</a> yesterday showed other rally attendees speaking about Obama's \"terrorist connections\". Rally warm-up speakers have referred to \"Barack Hussein Obama\" at least twice.</p> <p>In a statement, the McCain campaign sought to distance itself from what it calls \"inappropriate rhetoric\", but for the first time the Republican National Committee will today launch ads in Indiana and Wisconsin that mention Ayers's name. And in Wisconsin yesterday, when one man took to the microphone to <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/mccain_supporter_rants_about_h.php\">call the Democratic contender a hooligan and a socialist</a>, McCain replied: \"The gentleman is right.\" The race, it seems, may get much dirtier yet.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama is in Ohio, McCain is in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Today also marks the conclusion of the Troopergate investigation, which could see Sarah Palin censured for abuse of power in the firing of the head of the Alaskan police, allegedly because he refused to become involved in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/10/uselections2008-sarahpalin\">a family feud involving her brother-in-law</a>, a state trooper. Palin has said she had other reasons for dismissing the police chief. </p> <p>Palin emerges from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/10/uselections2008-sarahpalin1\">Ian Cobain's mega-profile</a> in today's Guardian as a rentlessly ambitious climber whose bid for the mayoralty of Wasilla was conducted with an eye to the presidency of the United States. \"She's really pretty insecure,\" her mayoral campaign manager says. \"I was with her before she gave a speech to the people from BP in Anchorage when she was running for governor, and she was terrified. There are real fears there. But every time she goes out and persuades people to like her, it lifts her, it makes her feel better about herself ... She's a brilliant politician, but it's all about getting more and more people to love her.\"</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>One day of post-debate data did little to change the major tracking polls. In Gallup's, for example, the candidates remained in exactly the same position as yesterday \u2014 Obama on 52% and McCain on 41%. Obama continues to surprise in battleground states. In one new poll he leads McCain 51% to 43% in Virginia, a state which hasn't gone Democratic in a presidential election since 1964.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/09/sarahpalin-republicans\">Tomasky talk: Troopergate won't implicate Palin</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/10/barack-obama-tv-ad\">Obama buys 30-minute TV ad</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/10/uselections2008\">Younge America video: 'Race relations ... are abominable'</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/09/afghanistan.johnmccain\">Simon Tisdall: Fighting talk is self-defeating</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/09/uselections2008.barackobama\">Ed Pilkington: McCain has the look of a loser</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/deadlineusa/2008/oct/10/uselections2008-useconomy\">Deadline USA: a housing crisis tour of Riverside</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/debate-may-have-helped-obama.html\">FiveThirtyEight.com: Debate may have helped Obama</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14444.html\">Politico: Hispanics turn cold shoulder to McCain</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/09/AR2008100902331.html?hpid=opinionsbox1\">EJ Dionne, Washington Post: Obama v McCain is FDR v Hoover</a></p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>Joe Biden has been off the trail due to the death of his mother-in-law, but yesterday he was back, and cracking wise: \"Sarah Palin says, you know, 'I was in second grade when Joe Biden was elected to the United States senate'.

  "<p>The failure of schools to address institutional racism and help disaffected black boys has exacerbated the knife crime crisis in the UK, a leading educationalist warned today.</p> <p>Gus John, associate professor at the Institute of Education and the former director of education at Hackney, attacked the role schools have played in the burgeoning violence in the second anniversary lecture to commemorate the death of Liverpool schoolboy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/aug/02/ukcrime.football\">Anthony Walker</a>, who was murdered in a racist attack three years ago.</p> <p>John, who is himself black, said schools fail to equip white and black young people with an understanding of their past and its connection with the present condition of Britain.</p> <p>They also fail to \"equip them with the knowledge, skills and understanding to take control of their own lives, understand the origin and genesis of the hard won rights they now enjoy, safeguard and extend those rights and own their responsibility for making the future they face the future they want for themselves and their children, and not leave that responsibility to the elites that the system creates while they continue to exist on the margins and to implode\", he said.</p> <p>\"We bemoan their conduct and wring our hands when they slay one another, but don't insist on appropriate social conduct from them and demand a respect for other people's rights,\" John warned.</p> <p>A group of 80 disaffected black 12- to 16-year-old school students, with whom John worked in Bristol last year, said what they feared most was being killed and \"chillingly \u2026 one another\", John told the audience.</p> <p>\"When asked whether they felt their school was tackling that fear of violence and of death that worried them so much, most said that it was not the kind of thing on which teachers spent any time,\" he said.</p> <p>According to John, schools are too focused on enhancing school effectiveness, raising achievement and government league tables. This led to \"the destruction of hope, the death of aspiration, limited life chances and a burgeoning of the African presence in the prison population\".</p> <p>He urged schools to \"attend as much to students' self-development needs and to their identity formation as to their SAT, GCSE and A-level grades\".</p> <p>\"Let us demand that schools are organised and funded so that they treat children according to need and give them their entitlement to quality education that is not measured solely by their ability to gain five A* to C grades at GCSE.</p> <p>\"And if that means having class sizes of no more than six, where the children's needs demand it, then so be it.</p> <p>\"It is far cheaper and more societally just in a liberal democracy to do that than to spend billions keeping far too many young people in jail or young offender institutions year on year.\"</p> <p>John called on schools to do more for whole communities by running classes and groups in the evenings.</p> <p>\"It is increasingly the case that schools are not just excluding the young people who are the focus of attention in any response to knife and gun crime, they are excluding whole communities.</p> <p>\"Why not reclaim those publicly funded spaces and alter the image young people have of them, often because of the typically negative experiences with 'authority' they (and their parents before them) would have had within them?\" he said.</p> <p>John accused the education system of being \"institutionally silent for generations\" on the issues of race, inequality and social justice.</p> <p>\"Schooling and education has failed to tackle the issue of racism and its influence in shaping the identity of generations of white British people,\" John argued.</p> <p>\"Although the evidence persists of schools' institutionally racist practices - which lead to adverse educational outcomes for black students - Ofsted's approach is to apply a 'light touch' and not interrogate school's performance as far as eliminating discrimination and upholding the rights and educational entitlement of all students are concerned.\"</p>"
