  "<p>Within hours of the $700bn bail-out of Wall Street's financial giants clearing Congress on Friday, attention had shifted towards other stressed parts of the US economy.</p> <p>The focus is now on the country's jobs market after the Bush administration reported 150,000 job losses in September, the biggest monthly drop in five years which, if sustained, would see the US lose a million jobs this year.</p> <p>Though the political crisis in Washington was overcome with the second attempt at the bail-out bill being voted through by 263 to 171 votes in the House of Representatives, concern mounted quickly over the inability of the deal to cope with the wider economic weakness. In an editorial yesterday, the New York Times called on the government to move swiftly to protect Americans threatened with foreclosure and to pass a stimulus bill. \"The meltdown on Wall Street is only part of a larger meltdown and the bail-out bill is only one attempt at a fix,\" the paper said. </p> <p>\"The wheels seem to be coming off the economy right now,\" Brian Sack, a forecaster with Macroeconomic Advisers, told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's hard to see how we avoid a recession, and it could prove a tough one to climb out of.\" Under the broad terms of the bail-out, the treasury will have up to $700bn, released in stages, to buy up toxic mortgages and other assets in order to inject confidence into the financial system.</p> <p>Golden parachutes for executives seeking to profit from the collapse of their institutions will be forbidden, and the government is required to come up with a plan to ease the burden for threatened homeowners by adjusting the terms of those loans taken up by the treasury. George Bush, who has frequently tried to reassure the American public over the airwaves during the past fortnight, used his regular weekly radio broadcast to emphasise that the bail-out would bolster the general economy.</p> <p>But he said its impact would take time to filter through. \"My administration will move as quickly as possible, but the benefits of this package will not all be felt immediately,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The federal government will undertake this rescue plan at a careful and deliberate pace to ensure that your tax dollars are spent wisely.\"</p> <p>Ted Strickland, governor of Ohio, gave the official Democratic response, saying that the job losses, which now total 760,000 so far this year, were a sign that while the spotlight was on the big financial houses, ordinary Americans were suffering. \"The crisis that hit Wall Street a couple weeks ago isn't news to families on Main Street all across this country,\" he said.</p> <p>As the dust settles over the bail-out, some hard questions are likely to be asked about the amount of sweeteners added into the bill. </p> <p>With whips from both parties scrambling to bring representatives on board in advance of the vote on Friday, some $150bn of tax breaks were included in the final 400-page bill. </p> <p>The fine print of the legislation also included spending and tax breaks that were sought by individual members of Congress which they can now take back to their constituencies and use as arguments in favour of the deeply controversial measure.</p> <p>From today the first steps will be taken to implement the bail-out, starting with the employment of a small team of about 20 staff to implement the programme. The first treasury auction is likely to take weeks to put together, and will probably concentrate on discrete areas such as subprime loans that fell within a particular financial quarter.</p> <p>Some British banks with substantial American assets, such as Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC, are likely to be able to take part in the bail-out.</p>",
  "<p>The crisis at Scotland Yard will worsen tomorrow as black officers begin a boycott of their own force. </p> <p>The Guardian understands the open rebellion could see black officers placing newspaper adverts urging ethnic minority people not to apply to join the Metropolitan police.</p> <p>Britain's biggest force is still reeling after its commissioner Sir Ian Blair was ousted from office by London Mayor Boris Johnson following a series of controversies.</p> <p>One of those was a bitter race row which has led to the suspension of the Met's two most senior ethnic minority officers. </p> <p>Assistant commissioner Tarique Ghaffur was suspended after he began to sue the force for racism and publicly denounced Blair as a racist. One of his main advisers, Commander Ali Dizaei was suspended over alleged misconduct and both senior officers are under investigation.</p> <p>The decision to begin a boycott was made by the Metropolitan Black Police Association. Despite Sir Ian Blair announcing his resignation BPA chiefs believe discrimination is institutionalised in Scotland Yard's leadership.</p> <p>In a statement the Met BPA said that as of tomorrow it would \" \u2026 totally boycott all recruitment drives initiated by the Metropolitan Police Service to attract black and ethnic minority recruits and police staff.</p> <p> \"We will actively discourage (through our extensive community network) potential applicants from applying to join the Metropolitan Police.\"</p> <p>The Met BPA said the force was plagued by \"a hostile atmosphere where racism is allowed to spread and those who challenge it are either suspended, told to shut up or subtly held back in relation to career development.\"</p> <p>Alfred John, chair of the Met BPA said the boycott was still needed despite the announcement of the commissioner's departure: \"We're not going to stop because Ian Blair has gone. It is about the institutional racism that takes place in the organisation.\"</p> <p>The race row has been buffeting the Met for months and began in the summer after it emerged Ghaffur was considering suing the force for racial and religious discrimination.</p> <p>He formally issued employment tribunal proceedings then held a press conference where he professed his love of British policing and denounced Sir Ian Blair.</p> <p>The force and the Metropolitan Police Authority insist that press conference led to the suspension from duty of Ghaffur, who was joint third in charge of the Met and part of its inner cabinet. His key adviser was Ali Dizaei who chairs the national Black Police Association who was suspended over separate misconduct allegations, which he denies.</p> <p>In 2003 black officers began a boycott which was only ended after the Home Office stepped in and pressured the Met's leadership to reach a deal.</p> <p>BPA leaders say the force has made too little progress since the 1999 Macpherson report found British policing was institutionally racist.</p> <p>Tomorrow the Metropolitan Police Authority meets with mayor Boris Johnson installed as its chair.</p> <p>Today he continued to have to defend his ousting of the Met commissioner. Johnson said the move had not set a constitutional precedent and told the BBC that there were \"too many distractions\" preventing Sir Ian from doing his job and that it was time for a change. Johnson refused to answer why he had reached that view. </p> <p>Blair quit blaming the Mayor's declaration that he thought the commissioner should stand down at a private meeting on Wednesday.</p>",
  "<p>Peter Mandelson today said that he spoke to Tony Blair before agreeing to take a role in Gordon Brown's government and the former prime minister told him the decision was a \"no brainer\". </p> <p>Mandelson, whose surprise appointment as business secretary on Friday has been viewed as an attempt to head off a Blairite coup, famously fell out with Brown, when he backed Blair and not Brown to lead the Labour party after the death of John Smith.</p> <p>Today Mandelson said he took some time before making his decision to return to government but eventually realised \"it was the only thing I could and should do\".</p> <p>The new business secretary said he would not be masterminding Labour's election campaign but would \"make a contribution\", with the economy the main focus. \"Gordon Brown has changed, he has become prime minister and in my view is a very, very steady hand on the tiller,\" Mandelson told Sky's Sunday Live programme.</p> <p>\"I think he and the chancellor, Alistair Darling, have really demonstrated strength and very real qualities during this crisis and are going to continue to do so, and I want to join their team.\"</p> <p>He denied that his appointment would be divisive, dismissing as untrue reports that the children's secretary, Ed Balls, had attempted to persuade Brown not to bring him back. \"That is not the case, I spoke to Ed Balls twice on the phone yesterday,\" he said.</p> <p>He also denied that he had asked for the removal of Damian McBride, the prime minister's press and political adviser. </p> <p>But the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, claimed today that Mandelson's return to government was a \"completely desperate act\".</p> <p>\"If the problem with this government is it's divided and dysfunctional, bringing Peter Mandelson in is going to make it more dysfunctional and more divided,\" he told BBC1's Andrew Marr show.<br> </p>"
