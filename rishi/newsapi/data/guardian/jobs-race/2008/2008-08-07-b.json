  "<p>It has been an intriguing seven days in that peculiar subsection of American society where politics and celebrity meet. First, John McCain got all up in Paris Hilton's grill, forcing the heiress to respond by unleashing the devastating comedic powers already </p> <p>demonstrated in her blistering contribution to the genre of satirical cinema, The Hottie and the Nottie. Then Scarlett Johansson blasted the \"extreme sexism\" of the media for suggesting that there was something flirtatious about her recent claims that she was conducting a \"personal\" email dialogue with Barack Obama: clearly the email passed to Lost in Showbiz -- \"OMG Barack u r 100% lush and AWESOME!!!!! Me and my m8s luv ur plans to simplify filing of income tax returns by pre-filling wage and bank information </p> <p>already collected by the IRS ur wife is well lucky\" -- was a fake. </p> <p>But all that stuff is a mere bagatelle when compared with what's going on in the current </p> <p>issue of Harper's Bazaar magazine. There, former supermodel Tyra Banks has posed for a lengthy pictorial as would-be First Lady Michelle Obama, complete with mocked-up Oval Office set, and looky-likeys of Barack and the Obama children.</p> <p>Anyone understandably baffled by this turn of events is directed to the accompanying </p> <p>article. It appears beneath the ineffably menacing strapline \"from the runway to the catwalk, EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE for Tyra Banks\", which somehow gives the pictures the feel not of a homage, but of the photographs police find when raiding a stalker's bedsit, from which the accused has cut out their victim's spouse and crudely Pritt-sticked in a picture of themselves. The sense that you are witness to something slightly sinister is not a notion the text does much to disabuse you of, not least because it keeps carrying on as if Banks is actually angling for the job of First Lady: \"Ms Banks would bring some fierce grace to the White House. But she would be ever of </p> <p>the people.\" </p> <p>But lest anyone infer a certain creepiness about the proceedings, Banks is quick to set the record straight by lauding Obama -- \"one hot mama\" -- and carefully detailing her most important qualities: \"She's not a ha ha ha type . . . I like that she's tall.\"</p> <p>With the world's fears that the White House might soon be home to a diminutive ha ha ha type thus allayed, the article moves on to the more important topic of Banks' qualities. Her chatshow is apparently a kind of televisual answer to the Samaritans, dissuading would-be jumpers from the ledge or the gin bottle and the fistful of sleeping pills. \"I had a woman come up to me when I was seeing Rent once. She told me she was going to commit suicide until she saw [Banks'] show. I held her hand and cried with her in the aisle.\" The pressing question of how many of their fellow patrons found their enjoyment of the musical irrevocably marred by a former supermodel and a complete stranger drowning out the quieter passages with their sobbing goes unasked, perhaps because this kind of thing seems to be an everyday occurrence: \"I get that kind of stuff; it doesn't stop.\" </p> <p>But whatever you think of Banks by the time you've finished the article -- and it seems likely you'll think she's a bit crackers -- you have to say that it and the accompanying photos cast a harsh light on British political reporting, with its grey comment pieces and sketches and leaders. Should you doubt such reasoning, consider this. </p> <p>How much more appealing would the current foreign secretary seem as a prospective PM if he'd posed his threat to Gordon Brown's leadership not with a lengthy article calling for a commitment to a bolder policy agenda, but by inveigling a top homegrown model -- let's say Lucy Pinder, sometime Nuts magazine columnist and owner, according to the Daily Star, of \"the best natural pair in Britain\" -- to (a) pose for a series of photographs in a mock-up of No 10 with a David Miliband lookalike and (b) give an accompanying interview personally vouching that Mrs Miliband is not a ha ha ha type? </p> <p>The case rests.</p>",
  "<p>When a victorious Boris Johnson stepped up to the podium on May 3 London did not know what to expect from its new mayor. The man best known as the gaffe-prone host of television's Have I Got News for You had defeated Ken Livingstone, one of the most successful politicians in London's history. But after a short pause, the Old Etonian with one of the biggest personal mandates in Europe struck a conciliatory note.</p> <p>\"I do not for one minute believe that this election shows London has been transformed overnight into a Conservative city. But I do hope it does show that the Conservatives have changed into a party that can again be trusted after 30 years with the greatest, most cosmopolitan, multiracial generous-hearted city on earth.\"</p> <p>As the administration's first 100 days draw to a close there are signs that Johnson is becoming more confident that the mayoralty will provide the blueprint for the next Conservative government - and perhaps a launchpad for his own cabinet ambitions. \"If the Conservatives are going to be coming into power next time around, then let's share ideas and let's work something up together,\" he said this week.</p> <h2>Unpredictable</h2> <p>But London watchers say it is too early to know what this administration will mean for London or the Conservative party. \"Unpredictable is a good description of the administration at the moment,\" said Tony Travers, head of the London group at the London School of Economics. \"There is a sense that anything could happen.\" </p> <p>Conservative central office is also in \"wait-and-see mode\", according to one Tory. \"I think that Cameron is keeping a very close eye on what Boris is up to but he is also not getting too close. I think that if it all goes well he will claim it as an example of modern Conservatism and if it goes badly it will be portrayed as Boris being Boris.\"</p> <p>Johnson has been buffeted by two resignations, banned alcohol on tubes and buses and pledged to rein in the \"waste and bureaucracy\" of the previous mayoralty. But supporters and opponents accept there has been a lack of administration-defining announcements. \"I would probably give him five out of 10,\" said one official. \"We don't quite know what he is about yet and it can sometimes be a bit chaotic but most people are just watching and waiting to see what happens.\"</p> <p>There are plenty of Livingstone supporters at City Hall willing him to fail. But even among those who have been brought in by Johnson there are doubts about the mayor's grip on the finer details of the job. \"The thing with Johnson is that he is bright enough to pick up anything but I think his attention span is pretty short and to be honest the detail bores him,\" says one senior figure. </p> <p>Others talk of low-level chaos and drift at City Hall. Some fear he will struggle to control his deputies. \"It is not enough to be seriously damaging yet but it is very different to how it was under Ken where everyone knew straight away what the line would be and knew they had to stick to it,\" said one observer.</p> <p>Johnson, however, has settled into a routine. He leaves the Islington home he shares with his wife and young family after breakfast and cycles the few miles to City Hall arriving between 8.30am and 9am. He arrives at his eighth floor office where he holds a \"strategy meeting\" with his inner circle - including chief of staff Tim Parker and head of communications Guto Harri.</p> <p>According to those who work alongside him Johnson in private is the same \"affable toff\" known to television audiences. He never shouts or loses his temper. \"What you see is absolutely what you get with Boris,\" said former Tory mayoral candidate Steve Norris, who is now part of the Johnson regime. \"He is often in the canteen wandering around with his tray and a banana, chatting to whoever he comes across. His warmth is genuine and quite irresistible.\"</p> <p>But Johnson's charm has led to difficulties . One official says Johnson keeps meeting people at parties and \"with little more than a slap on the back and a proclamation that 'Cripes, we could really use someone like you', offers them a job.\" Opponents argue this informal appointments process has led to a purge of women and ethnic minorities from the top jobs. </p> <p>Another side to his character emerged last month when Ray Lewis, deputy mayor for young people, was forced to resign after accusations of financial misconduct and inappropriate behaviour.</p> <p>\"The weekend of the Ray Lewis resignation he was punch drunk with it all,\" said one well-placed source. \"He appeared befuddled and bemused, like an older boy who had been happily playing with children in a country house and then something had gone wrong and he just deflated. He seemed confused and a bit sad.\"</p> <p>The affair raised questions about his judgment and led to accusations that his management team had mishandled each stage, from his deputy's appointment to his final press conference. But Travers argues the episode did not do Johnson any harm. \"The over-riding impression is of Johnson standing by his black deputy, which helps to negate accusations of racism that were made during the campaign.\" </p> <h2>Platitudes</h2> <p>Johnson's supporters say his priorities were clear during the election campaign and have been reiterated since May 1. He wants to \"tackle crime, deliver value for money and improve the quality of life for all Londoners\". Opponents describe these as \"political platitudes\" and compare Johnson to child with a new toy he does not know what to do with.</p> <p>\"We really don't know which Boris we are dealing with yet,\" said Len Duvall, leader of the Labour group on the London assembly. \"Is it the Telegraph columnist with strange views on race, Boris the One Nation Tory, or Boris who cried when Margaret Thatcher resigned?\"</p> <p>Scrutiny of Johnson's election pledges remains difficult as the first three months have been taken up with appointing a team and dealing with the resignations of Lewis and James McGrath, who stepped down after saying of elderly Caribbean Londoners: \"Let them go if they don't like it here.\"</p> <p>But opponents say it is clear Johnson is overseeing a return to small government and cost-cutting, pointing to the findings of his Forensic Audit Commission, which called for more power to be handed to the boroughs.</p> <p>Norris accepts Johnson is in favour of small government and \"core Conservative values\" but insists these will help bring prosperity to the capital.</p> <p>\"The truth is that the first 100 days is really the transition period and he has done more or less exactly what I would want to have done. Ken Livingstone, quite understandably, created the Greater London authority in his own image and that means that there is a lot of work to do before we start to get a clear impression of what this administration is really about .\"</p> <h2>Timeline</h2> <p><strong>May</strong></p> <p><strong>3 </strong>Boris Johnson makes victory speech </p> <p><strong>5</strong> Appoints Ray Lewis, pictured below, deputy for young people</p> <p><strong>7</strong> Announces \"booze ban\" on public transport </p> <p><strong>8 </strong>Appoints \"independent\" Forensic Audit Panel to review GLA Group spending.

  "<p>Takings from touch-screen roulette machines in Ladbrokes' betting shops have edged ahead of earnings from traditional horse-racing bets - the first product to do so in the group's 122-year history.</p> <p>The average weekly sum per machine lost by punters playing in Ladbrokes' UK betting shops rose by 18.2% to \u00a3676 during the first six months of 2008. Meanwhile, traditional over-the-counter takings rose by 0.9%, to \u00a3251.8m, with horse racing accounting for just under half of that figure, increasingly losing share to other sports bet offers, particularly football. </p> <p>Takings from Ladbrokes' 8,100 machines for the half-year were \u00a3142.5m, benefiting from recent deregulation that allowed the bookmaker to advertise on television and to open for late-evening trading. Seven years ago about two-thirds of Ladbrokes' shop takings were from horse racing. But machines and football have attracted a new generation of punters, with a sharp contrast in betting habits between those under 35 and the over-35s.</p> <p>Brian Wallace, finance director, warned investors that seven years of growth from its machines was now likely to slow as the market matures. He expects machine takings to rise 11% for the second half of 2008, prompting concerns among some analysts about growth prospects for betting shops. Its rival bookmaker William Hill has also warned of slowing machine growth.</p> <p>Gross win from the Ladbrokes' online bookmaking, poker and casino operations rose 23% to \u00a396m, but the group in effect gave away \u00a39.4m in free bets, promotions and bonuses as well as spending \u00a319m on marketing to recruit and retain players. As a result, operating profit for the e-gaming division was almost flat at \u00a326.2m.</p> <p>Chris Bell, chief executive, said he did not expect aggressive promotions on the high street to reach the levels seen on the internet. Nevertheless, the group in June launched a reward points-based loyalty card scheme, which has already seen \u00a31m in free bets redeemed by customers.</p> <p>Bell and John O'Reilly, head of e-gaming, have lobbied Treasury officials to substantially lower the 15% gross profits tax charged on online sports bookies based in the UK, arguing that their web business will ultimately struggle to compete against rivals based in offshore tax havens. </p> <p>William Hill and other high-street chains are making a similar case to Treasury officials but they and Ladbrokes so far remain committed to a \"gentlemen's agreement\" under which the leading UK bookmakers promised in 2001 to bring their online businesses onshore, in exchange for the replacement of betting duty with a lighter tax on gross profits.</p> <p>That tax change, overseen by Gordon Brown when he was chancellor, led to the rapid proliferation of roulette machines in betting shops. These proved to be so lucrative that leading chains saw their share prices quickly double.</p> <p>Ladbrokes said yesterday its operating profit for the first half of this year fell 11.8% to \u00a3170m, largely reflecting a sharp drop in the traditionally volatile high-roller custom at the telephone betting division. Takes for the first three months of the year were strong but then faded with a run of good results for punters at Royal Ascot and the Euro 2008 football tournament.</p> <p>Bell said it was a testament to the growing popularity of football betting that Euro 2008 had attracted bets totalling \u00a330m - more than Euro 2004, despite the absence of home nation interest. However, he admitted profits were much lower as the ultimate victors, Spain, were well backed whereas Greece's surprise win four years earlier proved highly lucrative.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Touch-screen roulette machines - with jackpot payouts of \u00a3500 - arrived in betting shops in the mid-1990s and took off when tax changes in 2001 made low-margin games more lucrative. In 2003 Lord McIntosh, then sports minister, said the machines were \"unlawful\", a claim the government dropped. The 2005 Gambling Act brought them within a regulatory regime. A survey for the Gambling commission last year found one in nine players were problem gamblers or addicts. Ministers still insist the machines are \"on probation\".</p>",
  "<p>The White House has categorically <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/08/06/ST2008080600042.html\">denied</a> that it ordered the CIA to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/06/iraq.iraq\">forge evidence that Saddam Hussein was conspiring with al-Qaida</a>, a charge made by journalist Ron Suskind in his new book <a href=\"http://www.ronsuskind.com/thewayoftheworld/\">The Way of the World</a>. The credibility of the Bush press office is such that one is tempted to take it as confirmation.</p> <p>There is an old joke about the guy who claimed he could tell when Henry Kissinger was lying, and when tested had a 100% success rate. When asked his secret, he says: \"His lips were moving.\"</p> <p>In the great tradition of White House weaselling, in part revealed by Scott McClellan's book, one notes that there is no denial that the so-called evidence was a forgery, and a very tightly specific repudiation of the White House's role that actually leaves ten thousand several other ways for forgeries to make their entrances. Indeed, in the light of Suskind's descriptions of Dick Cheney's hard work on providing deniability, the vice-president's office is one such.</p> <p>One question asked in the language of another expansive militarist empire is \"Cui bono?\" Who would benefit from such a forgery? It is clear that the allegations of an al-Qaida connection, like the equally spurious Niger yellowcake document, were intended to justify the war. Suskind's book should not be shocking to anyone.</p> <p>Like Hitler's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleiwitz_incident\">Gleiwitz attack</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0805-09.htm\">Tonkin Gulf incident</a>, the carefully fed suggestions of Iraqi involvement in the 9/11 attacks were crucial to getting public and political support for war. That was what made the spurious WMDs so threatening. Washington Post polls showed that 70% of the American public bought the al-Qaida connection, and indeed many of the troops apparently still do.</p> <p>But there were no proven, or even likely ties between al-Qaida and Saddam. Let us do the \"just the facts\" thing before the inevitable ad-hominem attacks on Suskind drive out his message. The Ba'athists were secular nationalists until Saddam became expediently pious after the first Gulf war. In addition, at no point did Saddam's regime allow any Islamist organisations to threaten his monopoly of political power. It was with mixed shock and amusement that I read Iraq's answer to the UN anti-terrorism committee's questionnaire, where the regime proved its impeccable credentials by citing its use of the death penalty for any remotely terrorist-linked offence.</p> <p>The only connection is that the invasion let al-Qaida and sundry other fundamentalists into Iraq, and Saddam's viciously efficient secret police were no longer in a position to deal with them. </p> <p>As for the weapons, by the time President Bush ordered the attack, Hans Blix's UN inspectors were in Iraq coming up blank in their search for weapons, confirming what Saddam's own son-in-law <a href=\"www.fair.org/index.php?page=1845\">Hussein Kamal</a> had said during his defection, that Saddam had indeed disarmed years before. It would certainly be likely that any defector like Tahir Jalil Habbush would say the same.</p> <p>But former CIA director George Tenet's statement in large measure vindicates Suskind's points. Intelligence agencies are there to provide evidence that suits their masters, not the truth. Tenet says that Habbush \"failed to persuade his British interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence, concessions or negotiations with regard to the Iraq crisis,\" and that \"There were many Iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that Iraq had no WMD \u2013 but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the Ba'ath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack. The particular source that Suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner.\"</p> <p>That meant that, unlike Ahmed Chalabi's inventive sources, they were not providing the necessary excuses for war that their interrogators wanted to hear.</p> <p>In summary, who are you going to believe: a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist or a White House that has provably lied about WMDs, about al-Qaida, about torture and indeed about almost any other subject?</p> <p>In face of the fear of lese-majest\u00e9 that afflicts most of Washington's media and political operatives, Ron Suskind deserves support. Although one has to wonder. He is being published by Rupert Murdoch, whose hands-on approach to publishing leads one to wonder whether Fox, the Wall Street Journal and the rest are about to eat eight years' worth of mendacious words.</p>",
  "<p>African-Americans are <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/page/election-2008-political-pulse-excited-voters\">excited about Barack Obama's success</a> so far. However what they expect of him during this presidential campaign is another matter. It is clear that there are a significant number of people, including those who <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-Se6E4uZhs&amp;feature=related\">heckled him at a town hall meeting last week</a>, who expect an African-American candidate to focus on African-American issues and are disappointed that they have not been placed centre stage in Obama's campaign. </p> <p>The young African-American men who heckled Obama in Florida last week held up a banner that read \"What about the black community, Obama?\" They accused him of not addressing issues specific to African-Americans such as Jena 6, Hurricane Katrina and the killing of Sean Bell. They asked: \"Why is it that you have not had the ability to speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited black community in this country?\"</p> <p>Black British writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/04/race.usa\">Vanessa Walters expressed dismay</a> that Obama has distanced himself from rapper Ludacris's latest song, which features crude lyrics about Hillary Clinton, John McCain and George Bush. Writing in Comment is Free on Monday, she asserted: \"In the future, [Obama's] got to actually tackle some of the conflicts about being black and excluded.\" </p> <p>Regular Cif commenter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/10/barackobama.race?commentid=c67d0aba-384f-47e8-80b7-48752b453c1e\">halgeel84</a> takes a great deal of umbrage at what she sees as Obama's lack of interest in black issues. She regularly expresses her concern about what Obama has not, for example, said \"with respect to the challenges black men is facing in America today such as lack of jobs, racial profiling, mass incarceration.\"</p> <p>Such concerns are legitimate. There are indeed serious problems within the African-American community that need to be not only addressed, but solved. It's also natural that African-Americans would hope that Obama, who apparently understands their struggles and challenges and may be about to become part of a system that has oppressed them for so long, would want to effect change on their behalf. </p> <p>However, should African-Americans be managing their expectations? After all, Obama is running for president of the United States, not the NAACP. He is not a civil rights activist. Obama has carefully built up an image as a man for all Americans, carefully treading a fine line when it comes to racial issues and avoiding any attempts to pigeon hole him as \"the black candidate\" whose exclusive concern is African-American issues. </p> <p>It isn't that Obama doesn't care about, or isn't addressing, these issues. He has spoken in front of all-black audiences in churches and town halls, recently addressed the NAACP Annual Conference and in April met with the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1NA4T0F-rU\">North Carolina Black Press Association</a> to talk at length about African-American issues. In that discussion he acknowledged that \"we have some issues which are very specific to the African American community that have to be dealt with\" before going on to explain that \"my approach to this campaign has been to say that all Americans \u2013 black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, all of us - have an interest in seeing a more just and equitable society.\" </p> <p>It is that focus on all Americans, as opposed to just African-Americans, which is bothering some people. Considering that African-Americans tend to be at the bottom end of most aspects of American life, including disproportionate incarceration rates, a 25% poverty rate (as opposed to 8% for white Americans) and major economic inequality, this is understandable. A focus on everyone is great, they argue, but it is clear that African-Americans require more attention than others. But as Obama told the hecklers, he has indeed spoken out \"forcefully\" about the issues they have accused him of ignoring: \"Listen, I was a civil rights lawyer. I passed the first racial profiling legislation in Illinois. I passed some of the toughest death penalty reform legislation in Illinois. \u2026 That doesn't mean I am always going to satisfy the way you guys want these issues framed.\"</p> <p>The way in which Obama has framed the issues has been politically savvy. African-Americans who expect Obama to run as the \"African-American candidate\" and talk all day, every day about black issues are expecting him to fail in his bid to become president. When Jesse Jackson ran on an all black platform, it did not get him anywhere close to where Obama is now. </p> <p>The truth is that most Americans who Obama would be representing as president and therefore needs to appeal to care more about the economy, Iraq and the housing crisis than Jena 6. It does not mean, however, that African-American issues are not important, just that they are being addressed as just one part of the wider political whole. People may indeed have more success with these issues on a state or local level.</p> <p>Furthermore, the questions about what the next president will do to solve problems within the black community are not just for Obama. McCain \u2013 currently not so far behind Obama in the polls - should also be held to task.</p> <p>I understand why some African-Americans expect Obama to champion their causes more often and more publicly. However, by now they should have realised that Obama's campaign is not about them. At the end of the day, Obama may be an African-American, but he is an African-American whose role, should he become president, will be to stand for all people, regardless of race.</p>"
