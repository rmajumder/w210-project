  "<p>'Who's here? Everyone!\" chortles Roger Tatley, director of the gallery Hauser &amp; Wirth, from within his bustling stand. The names being bandied around suggest he's right: Christina Aguilera is coming later! Dasha Zhukova has already been! Is that Roman Abramovich? No, but Kate Moss might turn up! Inside this white-tented temple to art, capitalism and celebrity, headlines about collapsing economies seem like ghosts from another world. Catalogues are filled with six-figure price tags and visitors stroll around in that art-world uniform perhaps best described as \"discreet luxury\": men in slick black suits or Prada cardigans, women in Jil Sander shift dresses and black Louboutin boots. Herm\u00e8s and Bottega Veneta are the accessories labels of choice, and everyone, of course, is in black. </p> <p>Grayson Perry is one of the few exceptions to the monochrome rule, opting for bright trousers and a T-shirt proclaiming, \"This is what a feminist looks like.\" Is he worried that the crumbling economy will pop the art world bubble? \"It will slow things down, perhaps, but I see it as a good thing. It will blow off some of the froth,\" he says, standing smiling next to his \u00a316,000 print. Meanwhile, Charles Saatchi haunts the aisles, cutting a hunched but cheerful figure.</p> <p>Although the art dealers here are bullish about sales - to the point of seeming to protest too much - the buyers are far cagier. Those who are most open are the ones who can clearly afford to be. David Roberts, a millionaire dealer who owns Hirsts and Emins, says he doesn't \"think anyone wants to spend yesterday's prices on pieces that will go down tomorrow. So there may be fewer people who buy art as an investment.\" Similarly, Ralph Rugoff, of the Hayward gallery, says, \"People are more cautious and [galleries] want to attract the international visitors.\" Who are these international visitors? Most agree that there are more Chinese, Indian and Russians buyers than ever. \"But the Americans are still here. And the A-listers, too - they keep buying,\" adds Tatley.</p> <p>I am so distracted by talking to Tatley that I miss Gwyneth Paltrow and her friend, the Hello!-tastically named Princess Rosario of Bulgaria, wandering past. And before I have time to gnash my teeth, I nearly step on George Michael. \"We're just doing what we always do, checking out young British artists. But really, you should talk to Kenny [Goss, Michael's partner] as he knows about art,\" says Michael, his stubble and shades perfectly in place. Is there anything Michael particularly looks for in art? \"No, but really, go talk to Kenny ...\" OK, forget the art, George, do you take part in the social side of the event? He makes a moue of displeasure. \"Oh no, I stand to the side of all that. It's a bit overwhelming, really. It's like listening to hundreds of pieces of music at the same time\".</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2008/10/16/UNEMPLOYMENT_1610.pdf\">Graphic: The workforce in numbers</a> </p> <p>The number of people out of work rose at the fastest rate since the recession of the early 1990s in the three months to August, prompting fears that the jobless total will break through the 2 million level by Christmas.</p> <p>In the latest sign of the damage to the real economy caused by the 14-month credit crunch, the Office for National Statistics said the jobless total on the broad Labour Force Survey measure jumped by 164,000 in the three months to August from the previous three months - the biggest rise since June 1991 - to stand at just under 1.8 million. This is the highest level for nearly a decade. The jobless rate leapt to 5.75% from 5.2%, also the largest change since 1991. </p> <p>\"These numbers are truly horrendous and much worse than I had feared,\" said David Blanchflower, a labour market expert and member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. He told the Guardian his earlier prediction that unemployment would rise to 2 million by Christmas now looked conservative. \"Unemployment will be above 2 million by Christmas.\" </p> <p>The figures referred to the period just before the latest and most damaging chapter of the global credit crisis, which experts say will push the jobless total higher still. </p> <p>Blanchflower said he was particularly worried at the 56,000 rise in the number of young unemployed people, the biggest increase since records began in 1992. \"These are school leavers who are unable to get a job or claim benefits, which is why the claimant count has not risen even faster than it has,\" he said.</p> <p>The number of people claiming jobless benefits rose by 31,800 last month to 939,000, the eighth monthly increase in a row. August's rise was revised higher to 35,700 - the biggest since December 1992. Job losses were concentrated in retail and hotel and catering sectors, as well as manufacturing and financial services.</p> <p>The figures also revealed that the hardest-hit area in the country was London, where the unemployment rate rose faster than anywhere else fastest as City workers began to lose their jobs. The capital, the north-east and north-west have the highest unemployment rates. </p> <p>Nigel Meager, the director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said: \"No part of the country is spared. Much attention has focused on high-end jobs in the City. In an economic downturn, however, the real human cost is likely to hit lower skilled workers who find it harder to move into another job and have less of a financial cushion to see them through difficult times.\"</p> <p>Gordon Brown, speaking during an EU summit in Brussels, said: \"We will do whatever we can to ensure that people can stay in their jobs, we will do whatever we can so that people who lose their jobs can get new skills for the next job. We will do whatever we can to create opportunities.\"</p> <p>He promised to combine the fight against climate change and unemployment by broadening training to increase the number of people insulating lofts.</p> <p>\"So I just give you one example of how we can combine to meet the challenges of climate change and cut people's gas and electricity bills and create the opportunities for work and training for that work,\" he said.</p> <p>However, economists say that with the economy slowing, jobs will be lost faster than the government can create them.</p> <p>\"With the UK heading into recession, we expect unemployment to rise by a total of 1.5 million to around 3 million, or 9%, by the end of 2010,\" said Vicky Redwood of Capital Economics.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats' work and pensions spokeswoman, Jenny Willott, said the government must switch its attention to unemployment now that the bank rescue package had been agreed.</p> <p>\"Real families across Britain are suffering, not just those working in the Square Mile. As the number of vacancies shrinks, it will be harder and harder to get people back into work. It will not simply be a case of retraining the unemployed if there are no jobs for them to return to,\" she said.</p> <p>Brendan Barber, the general secretary of the TUC, called on the Bank of England to cut interest further than the half point reduction it made last week. \"We are now seeing the effect of the credit crunch on the rest of the economy. I fear that the whole economy will soon feel the impact of the problems in the banking sector,\" he said.</p> <p>The ONS figures also showed that average earnings increased by a meagre 3.4% in August, the lowest figure for five years. </p> <p>\"Pay pressures remain very subdued,\" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. \"The labour market appears yet again not to be an inflationary threat to the economy which helps to justify the cut in interest rates last week.\"</p> <h2>In numbers</h2> <p>Unemployment is set to hit the City hard. Thousands of jobs have been slashed since the collapse of Lehman Brothers a month ago, with <strong>HSBC</strong> reducing its workforce by 1,100, <strong>UBS</strong> cutting 1,000 jobs and <strong>Bradford &amp; </strong><strong>Bingley</strong> getting rid of 300 members of staff.</p> <p>A report by the recruitment firm Morgan McKinley out yesterday said that the number of City workers looking for a job rose <strong>42%</strong> in the month to September, as firms make cutbacks. But it found new job <strong>vacancies fell 14%</strong> last month. </p> <p>Robert Thesiger at <strong>Morgan McKinley</strong> said: \"Recent events have affirmed that changes within the hiring market can be rapid and on a large scale. The influx of candidates coming on to the market last month, largely as a result of the collapse of several City institutions as well as general instability within the industry, is evidence of this.\"</p> <p>The <strong>Centre for Economic and Business Research</strong> predicted earlier this week that City jobs will decline by <strong>28,000</strong> <strong>in 2008</strong> and a further <strong>34,000 in 2009</strong>. The worst-hit sector will be corporate finance, which is likely to lose half its 15,000 employees over the next two years. Employment in derivatives is also set to <strong>fall by 46%</strong></p> <p>The report also predicted that legal and professional services, insurance, fund management, securities and equities sectors will all cut the head count by between 10% and 20%.</p> <p>\"The chances for a strong bounce-back in the City from 2010 onwards also appear to be slim,\" the report added. </p> <p>Richard Snook, a senior economist at the research body, said: \"The City will be hard-hit by the crisis; we expect it will be set back by a decade, with <strong>62,000 jobs lost</strong> over the next two years.\"<br><strong>Kathryn Hopkins</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2008/10/16/UNEMPLOYMENT_1610.pdf\">Graphic: The workforce in numbers</a></p>",
  "<p>The White House gave explicit written approval for the waterboarding treatment of captured al-Qaida suspects by their CIA interrogators, according to a report yesterday.</p> <p>The most compelling evidence suggesting the Bush administration, at the highest levels, approved the specifics of the interrogation practice was presented by the Washington Post yesterday. </p> <p>Two secret memos were issued at the CIA's request, in 2003 and 2004, to authorise waterboarding, the practice involving strapping detainees to a board while water is poured down their nose and throat.</p> <p>George Tenet, then the CIA's director, asked for the written authorisation because he was worried about a possible backlash, including prosecution of intelligence officials, the Post reported.</p> <p>\"The suggestion that someone from CIA came in and browbeat everybody is ridiculous,\" one former agency official told the Post. \"The CIA understood that it was controversial and would be widely criticised if it became public. But given the tenor of the times and the belief that more attacks were coming, they felt they had to do what they could to stop the attacks.\"</p> <p>The existence of the memos provides the first clear evidence that the White House was involved in how specifically al-Qaida suspects were interrogated. Until yesterday it was known only that the White House had given sweeping approval to kill or capture al-Qaida members, in George Bush's memo authorising the war on terror on September 15 2001.</p> <p>Civil Rights groups yesterday said the report provided new evidence of the White House's close involvement. Jameel Jaffer, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the details showed \"the decision to endorse torture was made by the administration's most senior officials\".</p> <p>The newspaper did not specify who signed the memos. </p> <p>By 2003, when the White House issued the first memo described yesterday by the Post, at least three al-Qaida suspects, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, had been waterboarded. By then justice department officials had already provided the CIA with legal cover for the technique.</p> <p>However the CIA was worried at creating a paper trail showing the Bush administration authorising the practice and in 2003 the White House issued a brief memo authorising the agency's interrogation method. Tenet asked for additional authorisation, which came in mid-July.</p> <p>An extraordinary testimony to Congress by Condoleezza Rice, then national security adviser, said she had been briefed by Tenet about waterboarding in 2002.</p> <p>Rice said officials were so concerned about the tactics they directed the justice department to investigate their legality.</p>",
  "<p>The most galling thing about Peter Mandelson's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/13/mandelson-lords\">return to British politics</a> earlier this month was how Gordon Brown summarised his stint in Brussels. \"Everyone has said right round the world that he has done a brilliant job\", the prime minister proclaimed, a line repeated by several BBC correspondents as if it was an undisputed truth.</p> <p>A ceremony taking place in <a href=\"http://www.nationnews.com/editorial/305025285326278.php\">Barbados</a> this week indicates that Mandelson has little to show for his four years as the EU's trade commissioner. Governments in the Caribbean are signing an <a href=\"http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2008/february/tradoc_137971.pdf\">economic partnership agreement (pdf)</a> with the union, one of the few free trade deals that this \"brilliant\" negotiator actually clinched. </p> <p>The term agreement is a misnomer in this case. For the most part, its provisions were not the product of a frank dialogue on how the Caribbean could put commerce at the service of its people. Rather, they were drawn up by Brussels officials and presented in a take-it-or-leave-it manner. </p> <p>Enormous pressure was put on representatives of Caribbean nations to cross what they considered red lines. This was especially so with the inclusion of a \"<a href=\"http://www.wto.org/english/theWTO_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact2_e.htm\">most favoured nation</a>\" clause, under which any trade concession that these islands offer to major economies such as Brazil, India or China would automatically have to be offered to the EU as well.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.crnm.org/brussels_rep.htm\">Junior Lodge</a>, the chief negotiator for the Caribbean, had stated he was \"violently opposed\" to the EU's demands for this clause \u2013 which others have described as an affront to the national sovereignty of the countries concerned \u2013 as he felt it was being driven by an aggressive mercantilist agenda. Yet because of Mandelson's bullying, his region eventually had to capitulate.</p> <p>The bullying lacked even a modicum of subtlety. The Caribbean was told that if it did not accept an EPA by the end of last year, higher tariffs would be imposed on its exports to Europe. Shortly before he left Brussels, Mandelson reiterated that threat to Guyana, which initialled an agreement in December last but \u2013 following the election of a new government \u2013 has been <a href=\"http://www.bilaterals.org/article.php3?id_article=10922\">reluctant</a> to sign it. Imposing increased trade taxes on Guyana would deprive it of some \u20ac70m per year, a huge sum for a small economy where the national income per capita is only about \u20ac7,000.</p> <p>The EPA also boasts chapters on competition, investment and public procurement. Known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_issues\">Singapore issues</a>, these topics proved so contentious during the Doha round of world trade talks that developing countries insisted that they be taken off the agenda. Unable to get its way in a quasi-global forum, the EU is now reintroducing these measures \u2013 aimed at giving multinationals unimpeded access to wherever they wish to do business \u2013 through the backdoor.</p> <p>Just as troubling, the Caribbean is being pushed to adopt European standards of intellectual property. This is not a question of preventing fake Gucci handbags being sold in Jamaica or the Bahamas. Instead, the stringent rules relating to pharmaceutical patents in the accord are likely to mean that people with life-threatening diseases will no longer be able to afford cheap generic versions of medicines. And, according to one of the most probing <a href=\"http://www.ciel.org/Publications/Oxfam_TechnicalBrief_5May08.pdf\">assessments (pdf)</a> yet conducted on the EPA, public libraries and schools could be prevented from allowing students to have access to materials that are under copyright.</p> <p>None of this affects the Caribbean in isolation. EU officials have made clear that they want this agreement to serve as a model for similarly comprehensive ones they are hoping to reach with over 60 countries in Africa and the Pacific. Diplomats from these countries do not share Brown's view that Mandelson did a \"brilliant job\"; some have described the EPA talks as the most painful experience of their careers.</p> <p>A new report by <a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org/assets/pdf/BREAD%20Report%202.pdf\">ActionAid (pdf)</a> warns that foisting trade liberalisation on Africa will exacerbate the crisis over soaring food prices that drew some attention from western journalists before we all became fixated with Wall Street's woes. Requiring Africa to open up to European agricultural produce will further increase its dependency on imported food, rather than stimulating the development of the continent's own farming sector.</p> <p><a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/1466&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en\">Catherine Ashton</a>, Mandelson's replacement as trade commissioner, steps into an atmosphere of acrimony and distrust between the EU and some of the world's poorest countries as a direct result of her predecessor's sledgehammer tactics. It would be comforting to end on an upbeat note by quoting that inane pop song he was seen bopping to over a decade ago: things can only get better. But it could take a long time to repair the damage he has done.</p>",

Tenet made a request for additional authorisation in June 2004. The authorisation came in mid-July.</p> <p>The first indication that the White House had direct knowledge of specific interrogation techniques came to light last month during extraordinary testimony to Congress by Condoleezza Rice, who was national security adviser during Bush's first term.</p> <p>In written testimony, Rice told Congress that she and other senior<br>officials, including the vice-president, Dick Cheney, had been briefed by Tenet about waterboarding in early 2002.</p> <p>Rice said officials were so concerned about the use of such tactics that they directed the justice department to investigate whether they were legal.</p>",
  "<p>An ultra-sensitive form of the silicon used in most solar panels may soon help to harness the near limitless power of the sun. Thanks to an extremely rough surface, \"black silicon\" can absorb more light and can also trap a wider range of frequencies, including infra-red rays, that normally pass straight through standard silicon.</p> <p>Eric Mazur, a physicist at Harvard University, discovered black silicon by accident in his laboratory in 1998 when one of his research team blasted normal silicon with a very short laser pulse. Almost a decade later, the company created to commercialise his work, SiOnyx, has announced the production of the first commercial-grade wafers.</p> <p>While producing electricity from the sun's rays has enormous potential, the industry has been hampered by the high cost of silicon wafers. Research teams around the world have been hunting for ways to bring down costs by improving the efficiency of solar cells. </p> <p>Mazur said that photovoltaic (PV) cells using black silicon would significantly increase the efficiency of modern panels, the majority of which only convert around 8% of the energy falling on them into electricity. The very best convert around 20%. He said that a black silicon wafer could approach the theoretical limit of converting around 30%-40% of the energy falling on it into electricity.</p> <p>Daniel Davies, chief technology officer at the PV manufacturer Solarcentury, said there were two potential areas for development in solar cells: getting more out of conventional crystals of silicon and the high-volume manufacture of thin film PV. </p> <p>\"SiOnyx sounds like an interesting method of increasing the efficiency of conventional crystalline PV,\" he said. \"If this can be easily integrated into the cell processing that already exists then the potential to increase the global manufacturing capacity with a relatively low level of intervention is very exciting.\"</p> <p>Making textured surfaces on silicon is already possible, notes Keith Barnham, a physicist at Imperial College London who works on PV cells. \"What's important is if this [technique] helps the light absorption so that you can get away with thinner cells. There has been a silicon shortage and the price is not coming down, so the less you use of it the better. With good light-trapping, which is what these can do, you can hope to get higher efficiency in a much thinner cell.\"</p> <p>The rough surface of black silicon allows it absorb light from many different angles, producing an electrical response to light that is 500 times greater than normal silicon. Another advantage is that black silicon can absorb infra-red radiation, which makes up around a quarter of the energy coming from the sun and which normally passes through silicon panels. As well as PV cells, it could improve the performance of any device that uses silicon to detect low levels of light, such as night vision goggles, medical imaging equipment, surveillance satellites and even digital cameras.</p> <p>\"We've been completely stealth, there hasn't been anything published about the company since its founding. We wanted to make sure we could scale the technology into a commercial foundry,\" said Steve Saylor, chief executive of SiOnyx. \"The recent success in doing that is why we've started to introduce the company.\"</p> <p>More than $11m (\u00a36.3m) of venture capital has been invested so far in the Massachusetts-based SiOnyx. Mazur said the most recent work has shown that additional cost of making black, as opposed to standard, silicon wafers was marginal. \"We were in a standard silicon foundry and there was no modification required to it.\"</p> <p>Greenpeace's chief scientist Doug Parr expressed a note of caution: \"The challenge [for solar] is cheap mass production and a widespread application of the technology. Many apparent breakthroughs fall at this hurdle, but we hope that black silicon can get to the next stage.\"</p> <p>Mazur said his discovery of black silicon was serendipitous: \"We were doing research on the chemical reactions on metal surfaces and, on a hunch, I said let's look at semiconductors, without a clear plan.\" </p> <p>One of his research team fired short pulses of laser light at a piece of silicon wafer in the presence of the gas sulphur hexafluoride. When Mazur examined the resulting black silicon under a high-powered microscope, he found the surface was covered in a forest of short spikes.</p>",

  "<p>British unemployment today posted its biggest rise since the country's last recession 17 years ago as the financial crisis filtered through to the jobs market. </p> <p>Official figures showed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/unemploymentdata\">unemployment</a> measured by International Labour Organisation (ILO) standards rose by 164,000 in the three months to August from the previous quarter to stand at 1.79 million.

And 147,000 people faced redundancy in the three months to August, up by 28,000. </p> <p>For many people, a bleak Christmas lies ahead as the fallout from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">stockmarket turmoil</a> spreads to the rest of the economy. </p> <p>Brendan Barber, the general secretary of the TUC, said: \"We are now seeing the effect of the credit crunch on the rest of the economy. I fear that the whole economy will soon feel the impact of the problems in the banking sector.\" </p> <p>He urged the Bank of England to cut interest rates again to avoid a severe recession. </p> <p>Derek Simpson, the joint general secretary of the Unite union, said: \"Government intervention should not just stop with the banks. Action across the wider economy is necessary to protect jobs and the economy in a recession.\" </p> <p>Alan Clarke, UK economist at BNP Paribas, said: \"If you look at the claimant count number, it wasn't as bad as expected, but if you look at the ILO, it was simply awful. These numbers are falling off a cliff.\" </p> <p>In a sign that consumer price inflation - now at a 16-year high of 5.2% - is not feeding into wages, annual average earnings growth slowed to 3.4% in the three months to August, its weakest in five years. </p> <p>\"As for pay pressures, the average earnings numbers remain very subdued,\" said Philip Shaw, the chief economist at Investec. \"The labour market appears yet again not to be an inflationary threat to the economy which helps to justify the cut in interest rates last week.\" </p> <p>Economists believe it is going to get worse. Thousands of jobs are being lost in the City, where banks have merged or collapsed, and on the high street, where growing numbers of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/retail\">retailers</a> are going bust. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/manufacturingdata\">Manufacturers</a> laid off 46,000 workers in the three months to August, taking the total number of manufacturing jobs to 2.87million, today's figures from the Office for National Statistics showed. </p> <p>Job losses are spread across the economy, with Cadbury announcing 580 job cuts this week and ITV cutting about 1,000 jobs. The Centre for Economics and Business Research estimates 62,000 financial jobs will be lost by the end of next year. </p> <p>Nigel Meager, the director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said: \"No part of the country is spared. Much attention has focused on high-end jobs in the City. In an economic downturn, however, the real human cost is likely to hit lower-skilled workers who find it harder to move into another job and have less of a financial cushion to see them through difficult times. </p> <p>\"As vacancies continue to evaporate, competition for any job available will become fierce and the existing long-term unemployed, as well as young people entering the labour market will be particularly disadvantaged.\"</p>",
  "<p>Figures out today suggest the number of credit-crunched City workers looking for a new job last month increased by 42%. And yet, rather bizarrely, according to a survey by financial service recruiter <a href=\"http://www.morganmckinley.com/\">Morgan McKinley</a> the bankers, lawyers and financiers who did find new roles in September managed to negotiate an average salary increase of 18%. Nice work if you can get it (again).<br> As banks are merged or collapse, thousands of jobs are being lost in London's financial district. Unfortunately for the rest of us, the financial services sector supports more than one million jobs directly in Britain and accounts for a third of the economy. And those ties are now beginning to tell.</p> <p>British unemployment figures recorded their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/15/unemploymentdata-recession\">biggest rise today for 17 years</a> - up half a percentage point to 5.7% - as workers across the economy, from bricklayers and shop assistants to estate agents and car salesmen, begin to share the pain.<br> Everyone gets a similar looking P45 or \"pink slip\" when they lose their job, but are we witnessing two tiers of job losses? City high flyers who get healthy payouts and help to move into a new job, and those workers being laid off in other sectors for whom there will be no golden handshakes and outplacement services? How long will they have to wait be to be re-employed? What is your experience of job loss during this downturn?</p>",
  "<h2>Vicky Redwood, UK economist at Capital Economics</h2> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/15/unemploymentdata-recession\">UK unemployment is continuing its upward march</a>. September's rise in the claimant count measure of 31,800 was slightly lower than August's rise. But at this rate, the claimant count will still surpass 1m by the end of this year. And the wider ILO measure of unemployment is shooting up much more quickly. The 164,000 rise in the 3 months to August (driven by a sharp drop in employment) pushed the unemployment rate up to 5.7% from 5.2% in the previous quarter. With the UK heading into recession, we expect this measure to rise by a total of 1.5m to around 3m or 9% by the end of 2010,\" she said. </p> <p>\"The threat of a pick-up in pay growth has therefore all but disappeared. Indeed, the 3.4% headline rate of average earnings growth in August was its lowest since 2003. With inflationary pressures outside the labour market now easing markedly too, the way's clear for aggressive interest rate cuts.\"</p> <h2>Howard Archer at Global Insight</h2> <p>\"It seems inevitable that unemployment will rise sharply further over the coming months as near certain recession and depressed business confidence impact. Extended very tight credit conditions would also be liable to lead to firms having to shed jobs. Consequently, claimant count unemployment seems poised to move above 1 million in November and we expect it to climb markedly higher through 2009. Indeed, it could well reach 2 million in 2010. Unemployment on the ILO measure seems certain to rise well above 2 million in 2009,\" Archer said.</p> <h2>Alan Clarke at BNP Paribas</h2> <p>\"The claimant count number may have shown an increase of 32k - not quite as bad as the 35k consensus - but the ILO numbers were simply awful. The ILO measure of unemployment rose by 164k in the last 3 months, that compares to an 81k reported the prior month and is the biggest rise since July 1991,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Employment was equally depressing, with employment falling by 122k in the latest 3 months. That compares to a 16k loss the prior month. </p> <p>\"Earnings growth was more subdued than expected, slowing to 3.4% 3m/yr for the headline (from 3.5) and ex bonus slowing to 3.6% 3m/yr (from 3.7).</p> <p>\"To summarise - these data are grim. Employment is falling off a cliff and it is still early days in this slowdown. Unemployment is rising at a pace not seen since the worst of the early 90s recession.\" </p> <h2>David Kern at the British Chambers of Commerce</h2> <p>\"The worse-than-expected labour market figures highlight the deepening recessionary pressures in the economy. Unemployment is rising, and employment is falling, at their fastest quarterly rates since the early 1990s. Unemployment will rise above the two million mark earlier than we expected. But average earnings growth is falling, confirming that inflationary pressures are easing,\" he said.</p> <p>\"In view of the deteriorating situation, the MPC must now seriously consider a half per cent cut in interest rates at its November meeting. It is also critically important for the Government to announce cuts in business taxation.\"</p> <h2>Lib Dem shadow work and pensions secretary Jenny Willott</h2> <p>\"These figures come as no surprise and are only likely to get worse over the coming months. The effects of the banking crisis have filtered down to the real economy and are affecting people across the county,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Now the banking rescue package has been agreed, the Government must turn its attention to unemployment and inflation. Real families across Britain are suffering, not just those working in the Square Mile. </p> <p>\"As the number of vacancies shrink, it will be harder and harder to get people back into work. It will not simply be a case of retraining the unemployed if there are no jobs for them to return to.\"</p> <h2>Nigel Meager, director of the Institute for Employment Studies</h2> <p>\"Measured unemployment continues to grow, and will keep doing so in the months ahead as the effect of the financial crisis feeds through into the real economy. The labour market responds with a lag to economic changes, however, and it is still too early to say how big the overall impact on employment will be. Developments in the last month mean that an economic recession in the months ahead is almost certain, but its depth and duration are much less certain.<br> \"The labour market has entered this downturn in better shape than it was in previous downturns, and there are still reasons to hope that it may prove more resilient. Since January this year the claimant count increase has averaged 18,000 per month; in the very early stages of the last two recessions it averaged well over 50,000 per month. Reductions in migration and in the numbers of older workers staying on in the labour market may dampen the overall impact on unemployment this time round.\"</p> <h2>CBI's deputy director-general John Cridland</h2> <p>\"These figures are worse than we expected. They suggest the fallout from the slowdown in the economy is being felt by individuals faster and sooner than previously thought. These figures pre-date the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the turbulence which followed, indicating unemployment is likely to rise further through the winter. <br> \"However, changes in the economy since the recessions of the eighties and early nineties should help us avoid the levels of unemployment we saw then. The UK labour market is much more flexible and the recent moderation in pay settlements will help.  \"Inflation is also expected to fall sharply over the coming year, allowing the Bank of England to reduce interest rates further to help support the economy.\"</p>",
  "<p>Did anyone expect <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/15/booker-prize-india\">The White Tiger</a> to win? Certainly, it struck me as a choice that came from way out of leftfield. I'd also suggest that the consensus in the publishing world seemed to be bemusement as much as disappointment, since last night I was in the privileged - though slightly bewildering position - of hovering between the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booker-prize\">Booker</a> parties held by Penguin and Little, Brown.</p> <p>But the triumph of Aravind Adiga has wrong-footed me as far as this blog goes. I find myself unprepared. I had plenty of mental notes made about the others. Had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/sep/30/linda.grant.clothes.backs\">my personal favourite Linda Grant</a> won, I was ready to declare it a quiet triumph: a victory for craftsmanship, sharp characterisation, fierce intelligence and above all human warmth. If the judges had gone for bookies' favourite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/sep/05/bookerclubthesecretscriptur\">Sebastian Barry</a> I was prepared to admit that much of the writing was beautiful even if some of it struck me as overwrought. Were Steve Toltz to have scooped the honours I would perhaps have complained about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/oct/13/fiction-booker-prize\">A Fraction Of The Whole's lack of restraint</a>, but agreed that this was a talented writer who is hopefully on the road to something very impressive in the long run. Had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/sep/23/sea.poppies\">Amitav Ghosh</a> won, I had mentally prepared a few spiteful lines about how typical its heavily dealt-with themes of post-colonial guilt were to Booker victors. I'm also now embarrassed to admit that if <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/oct/03/booker.prize.philip.hensher\">Philip Hensher</a> had taken the honours, I was ready to be yet more spiteful and declare it a Tory plot and lay down a few conspiracy theories about how Michael Portillo's chairmanship had returned the most conspicuously rightwing Booker winner to date.</p> <p>As it is, I'm left grasping. I'm annoyed and embarrassed to admit that I hadn't really considered the White Tiger as a contender. Although I enjoyed the book, I had discounted it as too rough and too much of an over-enthusiastic debut to really make the running. More fool me. </p> <p>What's more \u2013 and perhaps in credit to Portillo's ability to sublimate his own personal politics to the cause of literary justice - this year's winner is fiercely anti-capitalist. Fierce, indeed, in every sense of the word. It's an angry, passionate polemic that may not be as subtle as some of the other contenders, but certainly hits hard when it comes to social injustice and human stupidity. It is, in short, an admirably tough book.</p> <p>Now that my initial disappointment that my favourite hasn't won has faded slightly, I'm even starting to consider The White Tiger a daring choice. Perhaps (as was last night suggested to me) it does sometimes read like a Vanity Fair article with fangs, but still it seems a creditable winner. Certainly, I didn't get the sinking feeling I got last year. Whereas the success of Anne Enright's The Gathering smacked of compromise, horse trading and each judge's third choice winning through, The White Tiger is a very different kind of animal. It is - hopefully - a book that triumphed after a real fight and thanks to its sharp claws rather than thanks to a dull statistical analysis. http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/thisyear/chair</p> <p>It could even be said that this decision marks a suitably provocative end to a very interesting year. True, there have been plenty of moans about the quality of the shortlist, but at least the whole thing has been debate-worthy. The award has also fulfilled its most useful function in directing the spotlight onto the talents of a few writers that might otherwise have been missed. I'm personally grateful to have been introduced to all of Linda Grant, Steve Toltz, Sebastian Barry, Philip Hensher, Amitav Ghosh, and Aravind Adiga. </p> <p>This year is further outstanding in the juicy intrigue surrounding the books that didn't make the final six. Having just read Netherland, I'm absolutely baffled as to why it wasn't in the reckoning. Even discounting the fact that I'm predisposed to enjoy a book about cricket and New York it struck me as a moving and impressive book by any standard. Meanwhile, the absence of Rushdie also seems odd. OK, The Enchantress Of Florence isn't as good as Midnight's Children. But it is good. And where were Ondaatje? Where was Andrew Crumey's Sputnik Caledonia? Finally, absurd as it may be that this is the first year a thriller even made the longlist, why pick such an odd and ultimately ineffective one as Child 44?</p> <p>So 2008 is a year I'll be pondering for a while to come. But will The White Tiger stand that test of time? Over to you.</p>",
  "<p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/125679/death.race\">Death Race</a>, there are people, and there are cars, and the two entities are really, really similar. People smash into people; cars smash into cars. Sometimes cars smash into people. I suppose there is a difference \u2013 the cars don't talk to each other, or spit in each other's food. But when the people in this film talk to each other, they might as well be revving their engines or honking their horns. There isn't very much character development.</p> <p>To be fair, there is a bit. There isn't absolutely none.</p> <p>The film is based on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/80959/death.race.2000\">Death Race 2000</a>, a movie made in the 1970s about a future dystopia in which people raced to the death. One interesting thing is that, in those days, people imagined that this particular dystopian future would take two and a half decades to arrive. But this version is set in 2012 \u2013 these days, we're much more impatient.</p> <p>I settled down in the cinema, which was about a quarter full, and sipped at my coffee. There was a sense that we were not expecting anything too great. </p> <p>In the film, Jason Statham is an ex-racing driver. He has stopped driving for, I think, some dark reason I didn't catch, possibly because there's a lot of background noise in this movie. Maybe he's killed somebody on the track. Maybe he's just \"lost it\". He's called Jensen Ames \u2013 named after the Jensen Interceptor, a classic sports car. He is lavishly, although not densely, tattooed \u2013 a tormented fighter rather than a heavy metal geek. He is \"cool\". He has no discernible emotions. There is nothing very complicated under the bonnet.</p> <p>Anyway, he gets put in prison.</p> <p>The dystopia is as follows. People in prison have a choice. They can either stay in prison or they can race to the death, in mad cars, and win their freedom. (At least, that's the deal offered by the prison's icy governess, played by Joan Allen. But is she being honest?) Meanwhile, these death races are America's most popular sport, with huge ratings, and the whole thing absolutely stinks with corruption. If you want a much more nuanced version of this type of thing \u2013 manly men, corrupt sport, and a sexy, bossy woman in charge \u2013 check out Oliver Stone's film about American football, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/82966/any.given.sunday\">Any Given Sunday</a>.</p> <p>But back to this film. What does Statham do? Of course, he decides to risk racing to the death. You'd think, as an ex-racing driver, he would jump at the chance, but he doesn't \u2013 he broods for a while. But then he decides that, yes, he'll race to the death. This is the bit of character development I mentioned earlier.</p> <p>Did I say that he's in prison having been framed for murdering his wife? Well, that's the situation. He minds about this, but not overly. Just like he minds when people try to kill him, but not overly. He is sentient. But barely. </p> <p>When he gets to prison, he somehow scores a woman straight from the pages of a lads' mag as his co-driver. Again, he seems neither pleased nor displeased.</p> <p>And then ... the races begin!</p> <p>For me, this is where the film loses its grip. You'd think that racing to the death would be pretty exciting, wouldn't you? But it's not. The reason for this is that you don't care who dies, because none of the characters seem to be alive in the first place. Still, there's a great deal of crashing, and people in grave danger, and people dying, and the vague, nagging worry that the Joan Allen character might not be telling the truth when she tells Statham that he'll go free if he wins the race.</p> <p>But you know what the scariest bit is? It's when someone spits in Statham's food. Which, I think, is pretty significant. Given that this is a film about racing to the death.</p>"
