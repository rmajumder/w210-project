  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday October 5 2008</strong></p> <p> In the article below we said that for eligibility under the FSCS compensation scheme, HSBC and First Direct are 'part of the same group' but are 'covered separately'. This is incorrect: they operate on the same banking licence so are not treated as individual institutions. We also said when Alliance &amp; Leicester is taken over by Santander, 'Abbey, Cahoot and Cater Allen are all authorised by the Spanish bank and they all operate under one UK licence'. We should clarify that Cahoot will operate under Abbey's banking licence and Cater Allen and pensions specialist James Hay operate on Cater Allen's licence. Alliance &amp; Leicester will retain its own licence. This has been corrected. </p> <p> </p> <p>Savers have been rushing to move money between accounts in the last week, fearing that their nest egg might not be protected if their bank or building society were to collapse.</p> <p>Cash has been inundated with requests from readers asking for more detail on which savings providers share banking licences, a fact crucial to protecting their money.</p> <p>If a bank or building society fails, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) protects savers' money up to \u00a335,000. The protection is 'per person per bank', which means this limit applies to the total savings that someone holds with all institutions operating under the same banking licence.</p> <p>Confusion is created, however, because some savings providers that are owned by the same parent bank have their own banking licences, while others share that licence. The Q&amp;A panel aims to provide more detailed information to help allay savers' fears.</p> <p>Savers should be able to rest even easier soon, however, as the compensation limit is expected to increase to \u00a350,000. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) is meant to be kicking off a 12-week consultation with banks and other stakeholders on this proposal shortly, but the government is keen for it to happen sooner rather than later.</p> <p>'The lead option in this consultation is to increase protection to \u00a350,000 of savings. This idea could be pushed through without consultation or legislation. It would simply be a matter of changing one figure for another,' says an FSA spokesman.</p> <p>Pressure on the FSA to act increased last week when its counterpart in Ireland increased the statutory limit for the Irish deposit protection scheme for banks and building societies from \u20ac20,000 (just over \u00a315,000) to \u20ac100,000 (\u20ac79,000). This increased protection will affect some savers in the UK, as it applies to the Post Office's instant saver account and its growth bonds range, which are provided by the Bank of Ireland, as well as accounts held with Anglo Irish Bank.</p> <p>Savings rates could also go up in the wake of the latest financial turmoil. When the credit crunch first hit, many providers turned to increasing the rates on their savings accounts as a means to draw in deposits, in response to the money markets drying up. Experts say it is possible that the same could happen again. Some providers have already launched new accounts paying high interest.</p> <p>The AA, whose savings range is part of the HBOS group, has just launched one of the highest paying one-year fixed-rate bonds currently available on the market \u2013 7.21 per cent on a minimum deposit of \u00a3500 \u2013 just beating the previous leading best-buy from ICICI, which pays 7.2 per cent. NatWest and the Royal Bank of Scotland were among the first, introducing new fixed-rate Isas paying up to 7.32 per cent and 7.25 per cent respectively. But you have to have savings of more than \u00a320,000 to benefit from these rates.</p> <p>Andrew Hagger, from price comparison website Moneynet, says: 'The more you have in savings, the more interest you will earn. Those people with savings nearer to the FSCS amount of \u00a335,000 might be the ones who consider transferring savings between providers rather than keeping it in one place. If you have sums of over \u00a320,000 because you have built up all your previous years' Isa allowances, then it's certainly worth considering one of these two accounts.'</p> <p>Barclays has also launched a new nine-month, fixed-rate bond, paying 6.3 per cent on a minimum deposit of \u00a35,000. 'This is a reasonable rate of interest, but there are other providers that offer higher on the same length term,' says Hagger, who recommends Anglo Irish Bank's nine-month bond, which pays 7.06 per cent.</p> <p>Both NS&amp;I and Northern Rock say they are seeing growing levels of deposits as some customers feel that their money is safer in the government-backed institutions, but the savings rates are not particularly high at either. NS&amp;I's easy access savings account pays a tiered level of interest from 1.85 per cent (on a minimum of \u00a3100 deposit) and 4.4 per cent on balances over \u00a350,000, while Northern Rock's esaver pays 5.75 per cent interest (minimum \u00a31 deposit).</p> <p>Michelle Slade, analyst at Moneyfacts.co.uk, says: 'Considering your money is protected with any institution up until \u00a335,000 under the FSCS anyway, you would do better to spread your money out if you have large savings, rather than put it all in a low-interest account with a government-owned bank.'</p> <h2>Q&amp;A</h2> <p><strong>Which banks operate under the HBOS banking licence? </strong><br>The HBOS group includes Halifax, the Bank of Scotland, Birmingham Midshires and Intelligent Finance. Birmingham Midshires also provides savings accounts for Saga and the AA. So if in the event of HBOS going bust, someone who had \u00a335,000 in a Halifax account, \u00a335,000 in a Birmingham Midshires account and \u00a335,000 in an AA account, would only get \u00a335,000 protected.</p> <p><strong>What about Sainsbury's?</strong><br>Sainsbury's Bank is half-owned by HBOS, but it has its own banking licence. So if you have \u00a335,000 in a Halifax account and \u00a335,000 in a Sainsbury's account, you would be covered separately for both sets of money. </p> <p><strong>What happens when Lloyds TSB takes over HBOS?</strong><br>Lloyds TSB and HBOS now have separate banking licences, but it is too soon to tell what will happen after the takeover. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society falls under the Lloyds TSB banking licence \u2013 so if you have \u00a335,000 in a C&amp;G account and \u00a335,000 in Lloyds TSB, you would only be covered for one of these sums under the FSCS. <br><strong><br>... and when Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp; Bingley's savings business is taken over by Santander?</strong><br>Cahoot and Bradford &amp; Bingley will operate under Abbey's banking licence, and the private bank Cater Allen and pensions specialist James Hay operate on Cater Allen's licence. Alliance &amp; Leicester will retain its own licence despite becoming part of Santander.<br><strong><br>Which banks are part of the Royal Bank of Scotland group?</strong><br>Natwest, Royal Bank of Scotland, Tesco Personal Finance and private bank Coutts are all part of the big RBS group, but each one carries its own banking licence. Direct Line, however, shares its authorisation with RBS, so if you have more than \u00a335,000 in a Direct Line Isa and an RBS account, you would only be covered for the first \u00a335,000.<br><strong><br>Which other banks share a licence?</strong><br>Yorkshire bank and Clydesdale bank share the same licence, as do the Co-operative bank and Smile, as do Barclays and Woolwich. Egg and Citibank are part of Citigroup, but both are considered as individual institutions under the FSCS. HSBC and First Direct are also part of the same group and operate on the same licence so are not treated as individual institutions under the FSCS. Nationwide is taking over the Derbyshire and Cheshire building societies, which will share Nationwide's authorisation.</p>",

It's kind of the last frontier of heliskiing in Alaska. In Valdez, which is more popular, there are a bunch of different heliski operators now so they had to break up the land into zones, for each guy to have his own. In Haines you don't have to worry about zones or loads of other helicopters flying around. There's only one operation, a lot less people, and it's not so much tourists as professional skiers and people making movies. </p> <p>There's another place called Tordrillo Mountain Lodge, in the Tordrillo mountains, just west of Denali, which is supercool because it's even more remote. You get there in a small plane with skis that lands on a frozen lake, stay at a lodge beside the lake, owned by [former Olympic skiers] Tommy Moe and Jeremy Nobis then take a helicopter out of there. It's like there are no boundaries, there are no people, you are completely removed from the world. You certainly don't have to worry about someone else skiing a line before you do. You have 100 miles of terrain in every direction.</p> <p>\u2022 In Haines, Alaska Heliskiing (00 1 907 767 5745; <a href=\"http://www.alaskaheliskiing.com\">alaskaheliskiing.com</a>) offers a weekly package for $3,950 (\u00a32,100), including five days of heliskiing and seven nights' lodging. To get to Haines, fly with British Airways (<a href=\"http://www.ba.com\">ba.com</a>) to Seattle, then Alaska Airlines (<a href=\"http://www.alaskaair.com\">alaskaair.com</a>) to Juneau. From there it's a 45-minute small plane ride ($100 each way) or ferry (two to four hours, $37 each way) to Haines. An all-inclusive week at the Tordrillo Mountain Lodge (00 1 907 783 4354; <a href=\"http://www.chugachpowderguides.com\">chugachpowderguides.com</a>) costs $9,100 including ski plane transfers from Anchorage.</p> <p><strong>Hochf\u00fcgen, Austria</strong><br>I've skied many of the popular resorts in Europe - Verbier, Les Arcs - but last time we went to a bunch of little places I'd never even heard of that were supercool. One I really liked was Hochf\u00fcgen in the Zillertal valley. The runs were challenging and we were doing a lot of skiing through the woods then following goat tracks to bring us back to the village. All the times I've been in Europe it seems the tree skiing is the best because whenever there's a dump it doesn't avalanche out of the woods. The culture part of it is great too, of course - the food and drink is completely different to what we're used to over here [Morrison is from Colorado]. People in Europe live the sport more than they do in the States; skiing is part of their lifestyle. </p> <p>\u2022 The Hotel Lamark in Hochf\u00fcgen (<a href=\"http://www.sporthotel-lamark.at\">sporthotel-lamark.at</a>) has rooms from \u20ac100 (\u00a379) per person a night, including breakfast and four-course dinner in the gourmet Restaurant Alexander (it has three Gault Millau stars, Austria's Michelin equivalent). Hochf\u00fcgen is an hour's drive from Innsbruck; a cab costs \u20ac80 one-way. Easyjet has daily flights to Innsbruck from Gatwick, Liverpool and Bristol.

We flew to Buenos Aires, then on to Mendoza, then it was an eight-and-a-half hour drive in a minibus. There are flights to a closer airport, Malargue, and that's only an hour, but I think those are only charters and just at weekends. So it's not super-easy but once you're there, you're there, and you're stoked! It's at the start of the Andes - when you stand at the top of the mountain, you look back in one direction on to plains, then in the other to high peaks. The terrain is great, we weren't using helicopters, we just did little hikes and traverses from the lifts to really steep, challenging skiing. </p> <p>\u2022 All America Holidays (0844 7700753; <a href=\"http://www.allamericaholidays.com\">allamericaholidays.com</a>) has seven nights at the Virgo Hotel in Las Lenas from \u00a31,550 including international and internal flights, transfers and half-board accommodation. Tourist board: <a href=\"http://www.laslenas.com\">laslenas.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>Craigieburn, New Zealand</strong><br>I've spent a few years in New Zealand. I'd recommend staying at Methven, about an hour-and-a-half from Christchurch on the South Island. You find most of the club fields [small ski resorts privately owned by local ski clubs, but which are open to the public] there and from Methven you can cruise around trying out five or six of them. To use the lifts you need a nutcracker [a harness you clamp on to the tow rope]. It's quite intimidating at first. There are only a few lifts but they are longer than you think. At Craigieburn you take three tows to the top, but you're at the top of some pretty challenging terrain and can do little hikes and traverses. </p> <p>I find that's some of the best skiing you can do because there's no traffic and no grooming and it's all natural. I think it's way more fun than skiing in a resort. You don't have to worry about dodging people; it's a completely different experience. There's a pretty slick heliski place called Methven Heli too. </p> <p>\u2022 Brinkley Resort in Methven (<a href=\"http://www.brinkleyresort.co.nz\">brinkleyresort.co.nz</a>) has self-catering studios for two from \u00a354 a night. Air New Zealand (<a href=\"http://www.airnewzealand.co.uk\">airnewzealand.co.uk</a>) has flights from London to Christchurch, via Hong Kong and Auckland from \u00a3810. A week's car hire costs from \u00a3250 with Avis (<a href=\"http://www.avis.co.uk\">avis.co.uk</a>). Craigieburn club field: <a href=\"http://www.craigieburn.co.n\">craigieburn.co.n</a>z.

There's a lot of great little places in the States with challenging skiing, but this is the longest and most challenging. It's one of those places that's actually busier in summer, when people come to visit the national parks nearby, but the winter is more mellow when it's much more of a locals town.</p> <p>\u2022 Inghams (020 8780 4433; <a href=\"http://www.inghams.co.uk\">inghams.co.uk</a>) offers a week at the historic Wort Hotel in Jackson Hole from \u00a3693, room only, but including flights and transfers. Tourist office: 00 1 307 733 2292; <a href=\"http://www.jacksonhole.com\">jacksonhole.com</a>.</p> <h2>See Seth in action</h2> <p>Seth Morrison stars in Steep (<a href=\"http://www.nevertoosteep.com\">nevertoosteep.com</a>), a film tracing the history of extreme skiing over the past 40 years, out this weekend. As well as showing Seth in action, the film features interviews with other skiing legends such as Anselme Baud, Eric Pehota and Shane McConkey, and asks why they risk their lives for the sport. It becomes poignant with the appearance of Doug Coombs, considered by many the greatest big mountain skier, who was killed skiing in La Grave a few days after filming ended.</p> <h2>My favourite alpine nightclub</h2> <p><strong>Graham Bell, ex-downhill racer</strong><br>There are so many to choose from! But in Verbier, the Farinet bar on Place Centrale in the centre of the resort is a favourite. It's a typical alpine nightclub with a good bar at the back and dancing. It's always lively and stays open late.</p>",
  "<p>Paul WS Anderson's Death Race , an expensive remake of Roger Cormans low-budget 1975 exploitation movie Death Race 2000, is a bone-crushing, gear-crashing action movie about a lethal motoring game broadcast to sensation-hungry TV audiences from a maximum security prison in a dystopian 2012 America. Jason Statham, a framed lifer, and Tyrese Gibson are the chief competitors, Ian McShane is Statham's in-house coach and Joan Allen is the tough, power-dressed warden who orchestrates the brutal proceedings.</p> <p>Speaking in the ladylike tones of a Daughter of the American Revolution, she has one of the years most memorable lines: OK cocksucker! Fuck with me and well see who shits on the sidewalk. The film-makers like the line so much that Allen repeats it after the closing credits. Watching Death Race is like entering a dance marathon with a pneumatic drill as your partner. </p>",
  "<p>Just as the distant beep of Sputnik shook US confidence half a century ago, so China signalled a new space race yesterday when a flag-waving astronaut performed the nation's first spacewalk. 'I'm feeling quite well,' said Zhai Zhigang as he climbed out of the spacecraft. 'I greet the Chinese people and the people of the world.'</p> <p>The mission commander, wearing a $4.4m Chinese-made suit weighing 120kg (265lb), floated out of the Shenzhou 7 ship's orbital module for about 13 minutes before climbing back inside and closing the hatch behind him. Fellow astronaut Liu Boming also emerged briefly to hand 41-year-old Zhai a Chinese flag that he waved for an exterior camera filming the event. The third crew member, Jing Haipeng, monitored the ship from inside the re-entry module. Broadcast live on state television, the spacewalk was the latest milestone in an ambitious space programme which could one day rival past American and Russian missions in its rapid expansion.</p> <p>The next goal is to assemble a space station from two Shenzhou orbital modules. The Cold War superpowers have dominated space exploration since the Soviet Union put Sputnik, the first satellite, into orbit in 1957, triggering a competition for national prestige with the United States that led to the Apollo moon landings. The latest show of Chinese strength could hardly have been more symbolic on a weekend when the US faces what has been described as its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.</p> <p>Leading Communist party officials, including President Hu Jintao, watched the spacewalk from a Beijing command centre, breaking into applause with the successful completion of each stage of the manoeuvre. Hu told the astronauts: 'You've done a great job.'</p> <p>Zhai, apparently reading from a prepared script, thanked Hu: 'The spacewalk mission has been accomplished smoothly. Please set your mind at ease, Chairman Hu and the people of China.' China is also pursuing lunar exploration and may attempt to land a man on the moon in the next decade, ahead of Nasa's 2020 target date for the return.</p>"
