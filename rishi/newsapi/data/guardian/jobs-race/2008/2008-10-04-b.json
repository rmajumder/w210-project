  "<p>The epic Volvo Ocean Race around the world got under way when crewmen on eight yachts representing seven nations launched in Alicante, Spain. In one of the most gruelling and hazardous events in sport the 88 crewmen are due to sail 68,500 kilometres, enduring punishing conditions with little sleep and living on dried food. Additionally, the crews compete in in-port fleet racing in the stopover ports around the world throughout the race.</p> <p>A double victory yesterday for Telefonica Blue in the in-port race series on Alicante Bay gives it the overall points lead. Sister ship Telefonica Black made it a double Spanish celebration by claiming second place overall.</p> <p>The race very nearly started without a full complement of boats. After a 24-hour effort by the shore crew, Team Delta Lloyd managed to get their measurement certificate only at 7am local time. Ger O'Rourke, skipper of the boat, the former ABN Amro One, said: 'I managed to get the crew to bed about 1am this morning, but the boat builders were working going through the night. We got our certificate at 7am - talk about lastminute.com!</p> <p>'The guys are knackered but what's the point in doing this race if you're not doing it all? We're not going in half-hearted, if we have to work through the night we'll work through the night. The comms aerial at the back was 20mm too short so we extended it. That was the last thing, and now we can go for a race.' The team finished sixth after the two races.</p> <p>During the nine months of this edition of the race, which concludes in St Petersburg, Russia, during late June 2009, the teams will sail over 37,000 nautical miles of the world's most treacherous seas via Cape Town, Kochi, Singapore, Qingdao, around Cape Horn to Rio de Janeiro, Boston, Galway, Gothenburg and Stockholm.</p>",
  "<p>Born in Sudan into humble surroundings, he used to describe himself as a Marxist. He became a billionaire entrepreneur credited with transforming a continent. You might not have heard of Dr Mo Ibrahim, but today he is named as the most powerful black man in Britain.</p> <p>Ibrahim is credited with bringing the mobile phone revolution to Africa, making it the only continent where mobiles outnumber landlines and improving millions of lives. It is this achievement which gained the recognition of a judging panel which, after six months' research, has drawn up a <a href=\"http://www.powerlist2008.com/\">'Powerlist' of Britain's 100 most influential black people</a>.</p> <p>Celebrity is a stranger to Ibrahim, who has an estimated personal fortune of \u00a31.2bn and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/23/international.mainsection8\">runs a foundation for good governance in Africa</a>. Yet the judges decided that he wields more influence than high-profile figures including the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu; equality campaigner Trevor Phillips; government minister David Lammy; and England and Manchester United footballer Rio Ferdinand.</p> <p>The women's list is headed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jun/28/labour.uk11\">Baroness Scotland</a>, the first female black government minister. In second place is Claire Ighodaro, a corporate finance executive, followed by Michelle Ogundehin, editor-in-chief of Elle Decoration and Real Homes magazines.</p> <p>The list of 50 men and 50 women was compiled by a judging panel chaired by the former Leader of the House of Lords, Baroness Amos, and included the award-winning playwright and actor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/05/britishidentity.race1\">Kwame Kwei-Armah</a>. It is published tomorrow by Powerful Media, which is organising a reception at the Foreign Office on Wednesday for what it believes will be 'the most powerful room of black people ever assembled in Britain'.</p> <p>But there will be no invitation for the supermodel Naomi Campbell or some of Britain's best known black pop stars. The judges made an effort to avoid clich\u00e9 ideas of black role models and to reflect the diversity of black achievement in Britain. The list includes architect David Adjaye, media executive Sonita Alleyne, barrister Daniel Alexander, actor Chiwetel Ejiofor, racing driver Lewis Hamilton, politician Oona King, social justice campaigner Doreen Lawrence, artist Steve McQueen, trade unionist Lord Morris, writer Zadie Smith and publisher Annette Thomas. </p> <p>The first annual powerlist report, sponsored by JP Morgan, acknowledges: 'It is probably fair to say that most people in Britain have never heard of Dr Mo Ibrahim but, arguably, he has revolutionised the lives of more people than anyone over the past 10 years.' </p> <p>It notes that, before Ibrahim set up the mobile company Celtel in 1998, there were only two million mobile phones in Africa; by the time he sold it seven years later there were 100 million. He has since launched the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/oct/26/moibrahim\">Mo Ibrahim Foundation</a>, which works for good governance in Africa, awarding a philanthropic cash prize to those who have 'demonstrated excellence in African leadership'.</p> <p>Michael Eboda, chief executive of Powerful Media, said: 'Mo Ibrahim is the sort of person who wouldn't just be number one on a black powerlist, he could be number one on any list. He has revolutionised a continent, transformed the way business is done, and is bringing Africa into the modern world. </p> <p>'He has gone on to be a philanthropist, to encourage good governance and accountability. He's also a humble man and doesn't seek publicity - a role model for entrepreneurs.'</p> <p>Ibrahim, Sudanese but raised in Egypt, came to Britain as a student in 1974 and went on to join BT. He said his place at the top of the list was 'very flattering' and he has never craved fame. 'I don't subscribe to the cult of celebrity,' he told The Observer. 'If I walk next to you in the street you won't know me. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/oct/26/moibrahim\">maybe we can change things and move Africa forward</a>. If we can improve democracy, raise standards of living, stop corruption - these are things that touch the everyday lives of normal people.'</p> <p>Ibrahim, 62, who divides his time between London and Monaco, describes himself as 'very proud' to be a British national. He praised the concept of the powerlist, adding: 'The important thing here is to produce black role models and show it's not all about music and football. I would like to see a black kid becoming an Einstein. The world is big and those kids need to know that, if they work hard, they can make it in business, journalism, advertising, whatever field they apply themselves to.'</p> <p>To qualify for the judging panel's consideration, an entrant had to be a British citizen or based in Britain. Many of those selected have lived abroad at some stage in their lives. After much discussion, 'influence' was defined as: 'The ability to alter events and change lives.'</p> <p>Second on the men's list is Tidjane Thiam, the Ivory Coast-born <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/21/15\">group finance director at Prudential</a>, who is tipped for the top job at the insurer. He is followed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/may/18/theobserver.observerbusiness9\">Damon Buffini</a>, chairman of the private equity company Permira, John Sentamu, and Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Commission for Equality and Human Rights. Phillips said of the list: 'It's important to show that there are people from minority communities who are playing a role in public life, ready to shoulder some of the burdens of the whole community, not just the narrow minority interest.'</p> <p>He added: 'There are two stereotypes: angry black men and suffering black women, and actually most of us are neither of those things. If people can stop thinking of black people they meet as fitting as one of those two stereotypes, they might look past the front page, which is their colour, and look at the individual rather than think of them as a category. This kind of exercise helps to do that and will make a huge difference to a lot of people's lives.'</p> <p>Eboda said that the title of most influential black woman in Britain was a 'shoo-in'. Yet at school Patricia Scotland was told by a careers adviser that the most she could hope for was to become a supervisor at Sainsbury's. She went on to be the first black woman in Britain to become a QC. Her appointment<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jun/29/uk.gordonbrown1\"> last year as the first female Attorney General</a>, the chief legal adviser to the government, was hailed as a historic breakthrough both for women and ethnic minorities.</p> <p>Scotland, 53, said: 'I don't think about myself in that way, but I was criticised just last week for not thinking that way. Others say to me I should be more obviously pleased about the fact that I seem to be \"the first\" all the time.' '</p> <p>Scotland is followed in the rankings by Claire Ighodaro, who holds numerous directorships at financial institutions; Michelle Ogundehin, described as 'Britain's most influential journalist on interior design and style matters'; Vivian Hunt, a director at management consultancy McKinsey &amp; Co; and Pat McGrath, the global cosmetics creative design director at Proctor &amp; Gamble.</p> <p>Diane Abbott MP, who placed seventh, said: 'I hope I can exercise some influence. There's a lot of negative publicity around gangs and guns and so on, but lists like this draw attention to people who are important and influential and positive role models in our community. We need to demonstrate that there's more going on in the black community than football.'</p> <p>The powerlist will be sent to Britain's 1,000 biggest companies and sold at WH Smith. It can be viewed at <a href=\"http://www.powerlist2008.com/\">powerlist2008.com</a>. Baroness Amos, who chaired the judging panel, said: 'It's about showcasing achievement, success and talent and crucially it's aspirational. I want our young people to know what they can achieve.'</p> <p>Explaining the omission of Naomi Campbell, Eboda added: 'It's no longer enough just to be famous. It's supposed to be a list of people who are positively influential rather than notorious.'</p> <h2>The top 20 achievers</h2> <h2>Men</h2> <p><strong>1</strong> <strong>Mo Ibrahim,</strong> founder and chairman, Mo Ibrahim Foundation</p> <p><strong>2</strong> <strong>Tidjane Thiam,</strong> group finance director, Prudential</p> <p><strong>3 </strong> <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/may/18/theobserver.observerbusiness9\">Damon Buffini</a>, </strong>chairman, Permira</p> <p><strong>4</strong> <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2005/oct/05/britainsfirst\">John Sentamu</a>, </strong>Archbishop of York</p> <p><strong>5</strong> <strong>Trevor Phillips, </strong>chairman, Commission for Equality and Human Rights</p> <p><strong>6</strong> <strong>David Lammy, </strong>Skills Minister</p> <p><strong>7</strong> <strong>Rio Ferdinand,</strong> footballer, Manchester United and England</p> <p><strong>8</strong> <strong>Kenneth Olisa, </strong>director, Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</p> <p><strong>9</strong> <strong>David Adjaye,</strong> architect</p> <p><strong>10</strong> <strong>Daniel Alexander</strong> QC, barrister</p> <h2>Women</h2> <p><strong>1 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jun/28/labour.uk11\">Baroness Scotland</a>, </strong>Attorney General</p> <p><strong>2</strong> <strong>Claire Ighodaro,</strong> independent director</p> <p><strong>3</strong> <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/may/25/homes\">Michelle Ogundehin</a>, </strong>editor-in-chief, Elle Decoration magazine</p> <p><strong>4</strong> <strong>Vivian Hunt, </strong>director, McKinsey &amp; Co</p> <p><strong>5</strong> <strong>Pat McGrath,</strong> global cosmetics design director, Proctor &amp; Gamble</p> <p><strong>6</strong> <strong>Carol Lake, </strong>managing director: head of philanthropy, JP Morgan</p> <p><strong>7</strong> <strong>Diane Abbott,</strong> MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington</p> <p><strong>8</strong> <strong>Tandy Anderson, </strong>co-founder and chief executive, Select Models</p> <p><strong>9</strong> <strong>Sonita Alleyne,</strong> director, Somethin' Else</p> <p><strong>10</strong> <strong>Abigail Blackburn, </strong>editor, Now magazine</p> <h2>Judging panel</h2> <p>Baroness Amos (chair); Annmarie Dixon-Barrow, headhunter; Kwame Kwei-Armah, actor and playwright; Michael Prest, physical oil trader</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Saturday 13 June 2009.

  "<p>Australia have sent for leg-spinning all-rounder Cameron White as a replacement for the injured Bryce McGain on their tour of India. White, who has not been capped at Test level but has featured in 21 one-day internationals, will join up with the squad next week ahead of the first Test in Bangalore, which starts on Thursday.</p> <p>Slow left-armer Beau Casson had been tipped for a call-up, having made his first appearance in the baggy green against West Indies in June, but White's recent experience in India, where he led Australia A in a recent tri-nation series, appears to have counted in his favour. He last played for the national side in a 73-run ODI win over Bangladesh in September, scoring an unbeaten 22, without being required to bowl.</p> <p>\"We feel that Cameron's right-arm leg spin and experience in Indian conditions, where he has just returned after captaining the Australia A one-day team to a tournament victory, is the correct option and will provide a good balance to our slow bowling attack,\" said Australia's chairman of selectors, Andrew Hilditch. \"Cameron's bowling has continued to improve over the past year at interstate level and his powerful batting adds extra depth and versatility to the squad.\"</p> <p>White's inclusion comes at the expense of his 36-year-old Victoria team-mate McGain, who is set to return home after a shoulder complaint ruled him out of contention for the series. McGain was in line to become Australia's oldest Test debutant since 1984, having swapped life as an IT worker for that of a professional cricketer at the age of 35.</p> <p>Australia's search for a successor to Shane Warne led to McGain being selected alongside another surprise choice, little-heralded 25-year-old Jason Krejza. White, known to Somerset fans for his explosive batting, will be expected to provide support for Krejza on the subcontinent's spinning pitches, but could even end up leap-frogging him in the pecking order.</p> <p>After taking three wickets in Australia's opening, drawn tour match, Krejza has struggled against the Indian Board President's XI, where Australia trailed by 141 after the first innings. His selection came off the back of a modest domestic season during which he collected 18 wickets at an average of 47.11 for Tasmania.</p> <p>The President's XI were 110-2 at stumps on day three, stretching their overall lead to 251, with Krejza sending down 25 wicketless overs in the match so far, at a cost of 136 runs. Australia's pace bowlers fared better, with Stuart Clarke adding the wicket of Aakash Chopra to the three he collected in the first innings, and Brett Lee removing Subramaniam Badrinath.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, a last-wicket stand of 96 between Michael Hussey and Stuart Clarke helped Australia to post 314 in reply to 455. Hussey ended on 126 not out, further enhancing his 'Mr Cricket' reputation on his first trip to India. Clarke second top-scored with 44, while Piyush Chawla, the leg-break bowler with two Test caps, claimed 5-89. Hussey's obduracy may yet be crucial as Australia look to repeat their 2004-05 success in India \u2014 a win that ended a 35 year wait.</p>"
