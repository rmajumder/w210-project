  "<p>Yesterday, my flatmate came into my room and asked, \"Are we going to die tomorrow?\" Cern, the European laboratory for particle physics, has apparently chosen today to try to recreate the big bang, using an atom-smashing machine called a Large Hadron Collider - and a chemistry professor named Otto R\u00f6ssler, among other scientists, thinks it \"quite plausible\" that the experiment will create black holes that will \"survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside\".</p> <p>Knowing almost nothing about particle physics, I consoled my flatmate: \"I'm sure they know what they're doing.\" And if they're wrong?, she persisted. \"Then you won't have to go to work on Thursday,\" I pointed out. This seemed to cheer her up, until I said, \"Because you won't exist.\"</p> <p>But everyone not existing wouldn't be so terrible. The most frustrating part of being dead has to be that life goes on without you: that everybody else is enjoying themselves, playing triple-letter-word scores in Scrabble, reading engrossing books you couldn't have read because they hadn't been written yet. </p> <p>And a black hole's the last place you'd want to be left alive in anyway. We can't avoid dying, but if the Earth does get hoovered into oblivion today, we'll all bypass the fear and suffering that go along with the average death. Unless you're worrying about impending apocalyptic doom right now, that is.</p> <p>\"But there are so many things I could have done with my life!\" some people lament. They usually have gallant things in mind: saving an elderly cat from the jaws of a dustcart, or winning a Pulitzer and being heralded as a genius by people they like and fancy, forever. No one ever says: \"I could have killed someone accidentally and done 10 years in jail for it!\" In any event, the chances are that most of us would have spent the extra time drinking tea on the sofa.</p> <p>In case you're worried, we're all going to be fine. Even if we're not, we won't know it, so in a sense that's still fine. In the maxim commonly used when people are trying to be bleak and miserable, \"We all die alone.\" Not this time.</p> <p>Above all, if we disappear together today, we'll be dying for a great reason: the noble cause of scientific advancement, on a mission to discover more about how the universe works. Seriously: will that really be the end of the world?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Ariane Sherine is a TV comedy writer <a href=\"mailto:ariane@arianesherine.com\">ariane@arianesherine.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The race row engulfing the Metropolitan police intensified yesterday when Sir Ian Blair announced he was temporarily relieving Britain's most senior Asian officer of his command with immediate effect.</p> <p>Blair said he was taking the action to put Tarique Ghaffur on authorised leave because of the way the officer had behaved in public since launching a racial discrimination case against the Met and Blair. The commissioner said Ghaffur's statements were affecting the operational effectiveness of the force.</p> <p>Ghaffur immediately responded by accusing the Met of \"wilful acts of victimisation\" against him. Through his solicitor he said he was discussing ways of stepping up the legal action by issuing proceedings on the basis of \"unlawful victimisation\".</p> <p>There has been an increasingly bitter row between the two men which prompted the force's deputy commissioner to step in and tell all involved it was time to \"shut up\" and get on with their jobs.</p> <p>Blair, who has been accused of not being a strong enough leader, appeared to have acted yesterday in defiance of a decision 24 hours earlier by the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) standards subcommittee that conditions for suspending Ghaffur had not been met.</p> <p>Blair said he was not acting because Ghaffur had announced his decision to launch an employment tribunal case against the Met alleging racial discrimination but because of his behaviour afterwards.</p> <p>He said the decision meant Ghaffur was on leave of absence with immediate effect and would no longer run the force's central operations command, take part in its management board or oversee the Met's plans for security at the Olympic Games.</p> <p>\"For the avoidance of doubt, the decision has nothing to do with his actions in filing the ET [employment tribunal] application or the fact that he has made the allegations which are the subject matter of the ET claim,\" Blair said.</p> <p>\"Rather, my decision results from the way in which he has chosen to conduct himself, for example by the manner in which statements were made in his press conference, and in conducting a media campaign, both personally and through the advisers and organisations supporting him.\"</p> <p>At a press conference a fortnight ago, Ghaffur, in full uniform, called in the television cameras to film him making a personal attack on the commissioner. Ghaffur accused Blair of repeated acts of racial, religious and age discrimination. He emphasised that he was taking legal action against Blair and not the Met, which he still \"dearly loves and admires\".</p> <p>\"My current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the Met, in particular the discrimination I have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner, Sir Ian Blair.\"</p> <p>Ghaffur's lawyer said he had had to bring in private security because he feared for his client's life.</p> <p>Blair said yesterday he had acted because of the impact of the row on \"operational effectiveness, leadership and confidence\" in the Met and the \"safety and security concerns of Londoners\".</p> <p>\"It is also clear this is having a negative impact on the London 2012 Olympic security programme and risks undermining confidence in it ... The interests of Londoners are not being well served by this current situation.\" </p> <p>The chairman of the Metropolitan Black Police Association, Alfred John, said: \"The message that this sends to black and minority ethnic officers and staff is clear: Exercise your right to challenge unfairness and discrimination at your own peril. You will not be listened to and you and your supporters are likely to be victimised.\"</p> <p>Dee Doocey, police spokesman for the Liberal Democrats on the MPA, said she was stunned by Blair's action. A meeting of the standards subcommittee on Monday had found that conditions for suspension had not been met. </p> <p>But Boris Johnson, the London mayor, backed Blair's decision.</p>",
  "<p>White women voters are deserting the Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama because of the sudden emergence on the Republican ticket of Sarah Palin, according to a poll yesterday.</p> <p>An ABC/Washington Post survey recorded that an eight-point lead Obama held over his Republican rival John McCain before the arrival of Palin had turned into a 12% lead for McCain.</p> <p>The trend is in line with other polls since McCain's vice-presidential running mate ignited the Republican convention with a speech last week espousing social conservative values and presenting herself as a small-town mother taking on the cosmopolitan media.</p> <p>McCain has taken a 3% lead in a tracking poll by the RealClearPolitics website.</p> <p>Although the momentum has shifted to McCain and Palin, the election will be decided by independents and moderates, where Obama's domestic and foreign programme should have the greater appeal.</p> <p>However, the loss of support among white women could be fatal for his chances of winning the presidency if it was to be sustained. Obama had upset this constituency before the conventions, with many Democratic women unhappy that he had dumped their champion, Hillary Clinton, out of the nomination race.</p> <p>McCain received another boost when Rupert Murdoch's New York Post backed him in a front-page editorial. Earlier this year, Murdoch, who has extensive media outlets across the US, had hinted of support for Obama.</p> <p>Palin campaigned with McCain again yesterday, before taking off on her own for what is likely to be a tumultuous return to her home state, Alaska. She is not only bringing in the crowds but also the funding. McCain said a single fundraising event in Chicago had brought in $4m. </p> <p>The Democrats were initially uncertain about how to respond to Palin, but Obama, in recognition of her impact, now devotes almost as much time to attacking her as he does McCain. </p> <p>At a rally on Monday, he ran through her CV: \"Mother, governor, moose shooter. That's cool,\" he said. But he went on to say that voters had to look beyond and study her record as a Republican to see that she would amount to a continuation of the policies pursued by President George Bush over the past eight years. </p> <p>Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, acknowledged she had energised the Republican base but said the crux question was whether she would succeed in reaching out to independents in the run-up to the election on November 4.</p> <p>Obama's campaign team are continuing to go through her political record in Alaska, in particular her initial support for the Bridge to Nowhere, a $400m link to an island with a population of just 50. She later switched to opposition of the project. Obama said: \"You can't just reinvent yourself. The American people aren't stupid. What they are looking for is someone who has consistently been calling for change.\" </p> <p>A BBC poll published today will show that, despite the tightness of the race in the US, Obama is the overwhelming favourite in 22 countries. He is preferred to McCain by a four to one margin on average across the 22,000 people polled. </p> <p>The margin in favour of Obama ranges from just 9% in India to 82% in Kenya. On average 49% prefer Obama to 12% preferring McCain. Nearly four in 10 do not take a position.</p>",
  "<p>McLaren have lodged a formal appeal against the penalty that dropped Lewis Hamilton from first place to third in last Sunday's Belgian grand prix. The decision to proceed with the appeal was backed by the fact that Charlie Whiting, the FIA's race director, apparently twice reassured McLaren that he was satisfied with the way in which Hamilton had allowed Kimi Raikkonen to overtake his McLaren after it had straight-lined the chicane immediately before the pits.</p> <p>\"From the pit wall, we then asked race control to confirm that they were comfortable that Lewis had allowed Kimi to repass,\" said Martin Whitmarsh, McLaren's chief operating officer, \"and they confirmed twice that they believed that the position had been given back in a manner that was OK. If race control had instead expressed any concern regarding Lewis's actions at that time, we would have instructed Lewis to allow Kimi to repass for a second time.\"</p> <p>There is not time for the FIA to convene its international court of appeal before Sunday's Italian grand prix at Monza. It is expected to adjudicate before the Singapore grand prix on September 28. The court has the power to restore the ninth grand prix win of Hamilton's career.</p> <p>Hamilton said yesterday: \"In the closing stages of the race I was catching Kimi consistently, lap by lap, and with three laps remaining I got close enough to attempt to overtake him on the entry to the last chicane. I managed to get slightly ahead of him in the braking area for the first apex of the chicane. He fought back approaching the second apex - but, in doing so, he left no room for me on the inside line. The only way for me to avoid a collision was therefore to cut inside the second apex.\"</p> <p>Hamilton goes to Italy leading his main championship rival, Ferrari's Felipe Massa, by two points rather than the eight he believed he had after Belgium. </p> <p>Surinder Thathi, one of the three stewards at the Belgian grand prix, said: \"There was no conspiracy against anybody, McLaren included. We acted professionally and within the FIA rules. Hamilton took a shortcut inside of the corner while off the track. We had a choice to mete out a time penalty or 10 grid places in the next race. We opted for the former and handed a time penalty of 25 seconds.\"</p>",
  "<p>An al-Jazeera English lawyer has today highlighted the appointment of women to other senior roles at the news broadcaster to counter claims made by a former executive at an employment tribunal that she was a victim of discrimination.</p> <p>Jo Burgin, the former head of planning at the channel, is seeking substantial compensation, possibly more than \u00a31m, from al-Jazeera.</p> <p>She claims she was discriminated against on grounds of sex, race and religion and effectively dismissed when her two-year fixed-term contract at the network, based in Doha, Qatar, was not renewed in April 2007.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337455487\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2008/05/01/JoBurgin220.jpg\" alt=\"Jo Burgin: pictured in the ITN newsroom in 2002.

  "<p>For the Tories <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/assembly/members/evansr.jsp\">Roger Evans AM</a>, a former transport committee chair - and a welcome commenter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/davehillblog/2008/sep/08/blogpost\">here</a>, by the way - reacts to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/09/london.london\">the news</a> by joining the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/davehillblog/2008/sep/09/blogpost2\">Lib Dems and TfL</a> in ganging up on Gordon: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"I share the concerns of TfL about this new black hole that appears to be opening up. We need to see more details and it might prove essential for the Assembly Transport Committee to hold a special session to get to the bottom of this. Last year, in the wake of the Metronet collapse, I appeared before the commons transport select committee (in my role as London assembly chairman of transport), and urged them to recommend the government provided the funding to make up the shortfall - a shortfall caused by their scheme.<br> The same principle should apply to a shortfall in the <a href=\"http://www.tubelines.com/\">Tubelines</a> contract. Fare payers cannot be expected to swallow another 10% increase which would be needed to raise \u00a31bn, and asking TfL to find the money would put major capital projects like Crossrail at risk.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And Evans's Labour successor as chair, Val Shawcross? </p> <blockquote> <p>\"It's vital that the planned investment and refurbishment programme for London Underground goes ahead. Our tube network is key to London's success as a world city; we need to ensure it remains so. The system is facing an increasing demand and must be able to keep up yet work on the Piccadilly line in particular has not yet begun. </p> <p>Given the very large shortfall, over and above the amount the Government have already granted to TfL for this period of the PPP contract, I would expect the Mayor to enter into negotiations with ministers to secure funds to enable all the planned works to go ahead. Tube Lines have generally been doing a good job for London. The next phase of their contract isn't for gold plating the tube - it's for vital maintenance and improvement works.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Which some might read as joining in too, but in a nice way - or asking Boris to, anyway. </p>",
  "<p>Buy a bottle of Bordeaux in London and it's likely to have a carbon footprint of about 1,200g (the footprint of a packet of crisps is around 75g). Roughly two-thirds of those CO2 emissions are from the production of the wine and the glass bottle. The rest is down to transportation. Why is it, then, that if you bought the same bottle in New York, it would have a footprint of only 100g more?</p> <p>Although the distance products travel matters, the mode of transportation matters more. The Bordeaux to London bottle travels by lorry, which has higher emissions than boats, which benefit from huge economies of scale and little wind resistance.</p> <p>The journey of a German Mosel wine by barge down the Rhine, then by ship across the channel, helps make its carbon footprint about 30% less than the Bordeaux's. And a near-zero carbon footprint method is provided by the 19th-century barque recently used for transporting wine from the Languedoc to Ireland under sail.</p> <p>Beyond how the wine gets to you, what it comes in also matters. Some cult wines come in such heavy bottles that they weigh as much empty as others do full. Shipping wine around the world often seems like shipping glass with a bit of wine in it. Nigel Greening, at his Felton Road winery in Central Otago, New Zealand, recently started using bottles weighing a scant 270g, which should reduce CO2 emissions by about 20%. New Zealand wine just got a little greener. And better still, Mumm has announced lighter bottles for its bubbly.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.drvino.com\">drvino.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The Metropolitan police chief, Sir Ian Blair, today made a dramatic intervention in the race row engulfing his force when he announced that the senior officer who accused him of being a racist was being temporarily relieved of his duties.</p> <p>Blair said this afternoon that Assistant Commissioner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/20/tarique.ghaffur.profile\">Tarique Ghaffur</a> had been put on authorised leave of his responsibilities with immediate effect. </p> <p>He blamed Ghaffur's behaviour since his announcement last month that he was taking Scotland Yard to an employment tribunal for racially discriminating against him. </p> <p>Blair was referring to a press conference held by Ghaffur two weeks ago when he appeared in full uniform and made an unprecedented personal attack on the commissioner, accusing him of being a racist.</p> <p>Blair said in a statement: \"For the avoidance of doubt, the decision has nothing to do with his actions in filing the ET (employment tribunal) application or the fact that he has made the allegations which are the subject matter of the ET claim.</p> <p>\"Rather, my decision results from the way in which he has chosen to conduct himself, for example by the manner in which statements were made in his press conference, and in conducting a media campaign, both personally and through the advisers and organisations supporting him.\"</p> <p>The Met said the authorised leave of absence meant that Ghaffur would no longer be in charge of the Met's central operations command, nor take a part in the force's management board and would give up his involvement in the security for the Olympic games.</p> <p>Blair said he was taking the action for the benefit of the Met and Londoners. \"I have reflected whether operational effectiveness, leadership and confidence in the MPS as an organisation and the security and safety concerns of Londoners are being affected,\" he said. </p> <p>\"It is also clear this is having a negative impact on the London 2012 Olympic security programme and risks undermining confidence in it.

  "<p>The team linked with a possible comeback by Lance Armstrong with the Tour de France as a potential goal were today playing down the idea as speculation mounted that the American seven-times Tour de France winner may have plans to race again in 2009.</p> <p>\"There are no contacts or plans of Team Astana to take Lance Armstrong,\" the team press officer Philippe Maertens said. \"As far as I know, Lance Armstrong doesn't have plans to do road cycling. We have no plans.\"</p> <p>Astana, the team run by Armstrong's former manager Johan Bruyneel, was named in a story this week as the team most likely to hire him if he returned to racing. Speculation ranges from the Texan returning to ride mountain bike events to the notion that he may race a five-event calendar taking in the Tour of California, the Tour of Georgia, Paris-Nice, the Dauphine Libere, and the Tour de France.</p> <p>Astana were not admitted to the Tour de France this year because of drug scandals involving the team in 2007, before Bruyneel took over the helm. They won the Giro d'Italia with the Spaniard Alberto Contador, the rider who took first place in last year's Tour de France riding for Amstrong's former sponsor Discovery Channel.</p> <p>The International Cycling Union president Pat MacQuaid said today that he would welcome an Armstrong comeback. \"If he wants to come back, he has every right to. Good luck to him,\" MacQuaid said. The ICU has in the past received donations from the American to its anti-doping programme.</p> <p>\"It may be he has a chip on his shoulder because of the accusations and rumours surrounding him, none of which were proven,\" said MacQuaid. \"Now there is a new system in place that can show any manipulation of the blood, he wants to show he was the athlete he claims he was.\"</p> <p>Since retiring from racing in 2005, Armstrong has turned his attention to marathon running and recently finished second in a 100-mile mountain bike race in the Rockies.

  "<p>The London underground network is facing a funding gap of more than \u00a33bn as the cost of repairing the tube system spirals out of control.</p> <p>An assessment of the tube network's financial needs published this morning outlined a financial black hole of up to \u00a31.4bn on a third of the capital's underground lines. </p> <p>The latest figures create a severe financial headache for the government when they are added to the projected \u00a32bn funding gap on the rest of the tube system. Transport for London, the London mayor's transport authority, this morning blamed the government and said the Treasury would have to step in.</p> <p>London Underground boss Tim O'Toole said the government must pay because it had imposed the public private partnership programme that parcelled out the tube upgrade operation to private companies. O'Toole has consistently warned that any attempt to cut back on the \u00a330bn upgrade programme would result in chaos because the network is struggling to cope with current levels of demand.</p> <p>\"Any funding required above TfL's budget should be met by continuing support by government, who imposed this PPP structure on the tube and Londoners,\" said O'Toole. </p> <p>Gordon Brown, who brought in the PPP when he was chancellor, and his successor, Alistair Darling, must decide whether to bail out the Conservative mayor of London, Boris Johnson. The mayor's transport adviser, Kulveer Ranger, last week ruled out imposing massive fare rises to raise funds. </p> <p>The scale of the funding gap emerged this morning in a report by the PPP contract referee, Chris Bolt. He said carrying out vital upgrade work on the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines up to 2017 would cost between \u00a35.1bn and \u00a35.5bn. TfL projected it would cost \u00a34.1bn and therefore faces a gap of up to \u00a31.4bn. </p> <p><strong>Metronet's funding needs</strong></p> <p>However, Tube Lines, the private company that owns the PPP contracts for the work, revealed this morning that it thinks the gap could be bigger. It believes the work will cost \u00a37.2bn, implying that it faces an overspend of up to \u00a32.1bn.</p> <p>Metronet, the contractor charged with maintaining two-thirds of the tube, collapsed last year after building up a projected overspend of at least \u00a32bn.</p> <p>In an embarrassing reversal of one of Brown's signature policies as chancellor, Metronet is back in public ownership after it was taken over by TfL. TfL has yet to reveal the funding needs for Metronet up to 2017, amid speculation that it also faces a budget deficit up to 2017 on top of the existing \u00a32bn funding hole \u2014 which covers the period 2003 to 2010. </p> <p>Tube Lines, which is co-owned by a subsidiary of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/baa\">BAA</a> owner Ferrovial, indicated that the government's role in funding would have to be clarified. In a carefully worded statement this morning, the company did not make a direct reference to the disparity between its cost estimates and TfL's. </p> <p>Instead, it hinted that the government should put in place long-term financial backing for the network, rather than allocating cash every seven years.<br>\"The question is not should the upgrade of the tube cost this much but how is this vital work to be funded? Funding for future tube improvements must be secured and maintained,\" said the company.</p> <p>One of the staunchest critics of the PPP programme warned this morning that cutting back work investment in new trains, signalling systems and tracks would be disastrous for a tube network that carries more than 3 million people on a typical weekday. </p> <p>Professor Stephen Glaister, a former TfL board member and head of transport at Imperial College, said: \"The PPP was claiming to deliver a programme of work over 30 years. That programme cannot be delivered for what the government thought it would cost originally. The work cannot be done, so the government will have to pay a lot more money. If the programme is not carried out, then we have got a serious problem with capacity on the tube in London.\"</p>",
  "<p>With hours to go before the Booker prize shortlist is announced, the prospects for Joseph O'Neill's Netherland appear to be the strongest.

Whether the judgments of bookies and bookbuyers coincides with the prize jury will be revealed soon after noon today.</p> <p>Netherland sold 2,369 copies in the five weeks following the longlist announcement at the end of July, more than second-placed Tom Rob Smith's thriller Child 44 (1,747) and third-placed Salman Rushdie's The Enchantress of Florence (1,621), according to book sales monitor Nielsen BookScan. </p> <p>Despite only being published on August 14, Gaynor Arnold's Girl in a Blue Dress has already sold 1,123 copies, while the novel to see the largest increase in sales thanks to a Booker longlisting was Linda Grant's The Clothes on Their Backs, which saw sales shoot up by over 400% to 627 in the wake of its nomination. The worst-selling title was Sebastian Barry's The Secret Scripture, which sold just 281 copies over the period.</p> <p>A shortlist of six books, selected by judges including chair Michael Portillo and writer and presenter Hardeep Singh Kohli, will be announced today at 12 pm.</p> <p>Amazon said that Steve Toltz's A Fraction of the Whole had seen a \"massive\" increase in sales as the shortlist announcement drew near. \"A Fraction of the Whole has seen a pretty stupendous increase in sales,\" said head of books buying Kes Nielsen, revealing that the bestselling longlisted title at Amazon has been Child 44, followed by Netherland, The Enchantress of Florence and A Fraction of the Whole. The Secret Scripture has sold the least number of copies since the longlist announcement, Amazon said.</p> <p>Nielsen said his personal tip to win was Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger, which he described as a \"fantastic read\". \"From a bookseller's point of view, I look forward to the years that something unexpected \u2013 left of centre \u2013 wins,\" he added. \"When Ian McEwan wins, whether or not he actually sells significantly more copies is questionable \u2013 although there is always a jump. But I always think back to a book like Life of Pi \u2013 that's a book which was really transformed by the fact it won the prize; those are sales which would otherwise not have happened.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile the bookies have failed to agree on odds for the 13 shortlisted titles, with Ladbrokes' frontrunner Rushdie at 4/1, and William Hill tipping O'Neill at 7/2. However, a rush of interest in O'Neill did prompt Ladbrokes to shorten its odds on the author from 6/1 to 5/1. Spokesman Nick Weinberg said: \"The weight of money is with Salman Rushdie. But we've seen interest in Joseph O'Neill's offering which has prompted the price change.\" </p> <p>William Hill's longest odds are on Gaynor Arnold at 20/1 and John Berger at 16/1, while Ladbrokes believes the least likely is Steve Toltz at 16/1.</p> <p>The longlist in full:</p> <p>The White Tiger by Aravind Adiga (Atlantic)</p> <p>Girl in a Blue Dress by Gaynor Arnold (Tindal Street Press)</p> <p>The Secret Scripture by Sebastian Barry (Faber and Faber)</p> <p>From A to X by John Berger (Verso)</p> <p>The Lost Dog by Michelle de Kretser (Chatto &amp; Windus)</p> <p>Sea of Poppies by Amitav Ghosh (John Murray)</p> <p>The Clothes on Their Backs by Linda Grant (Virago)</p> <p>The Northern Clemency by Philip Hensher (Fourth Estate)</p> <p>Netherland by Joseph O'Neill (Fourth Estate)</p> <p>The Enchantress of Florence by Salman Rushdie (Jonathan Cape)</p> <p>Child 44 by Tom Rob Smith (Simon &amp; Schuster)</p> <p>A Fraction of the Whole by Steve Toltz (Hamish Hamilton)</p>"
