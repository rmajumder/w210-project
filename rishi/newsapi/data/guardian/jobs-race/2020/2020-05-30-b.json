  "<p>Vincent Kompany has turned down an opportunity to become Pep Guardiola\u2019s coaching assistant at Manchester City in favour of continuing in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/19/vincent-kompany-manchester-city-leaves-fa-cup\">player-coaching role at Anderlecht</a>.</p> <p>The vacancy at City arose when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/20/arsenal-appoint-mikel-arteta-as-manager-to-replace-unai-emery\">Mikel Arteta left to join Arsenal</a>, who are due to play at the Etihad when the Premier League is planned to return on 17 June.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/30/riyad-mahrez-sets-manchester-city-sights-on-champions-league-glory\">Riyad Mahrez sets Manchester City's sights on Champions League glory</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Arteta was also the individual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/23/arsenal-put-indefinite-stop-to-training-coronavirus-irresponsible\">whose positive test for coronavirus in March</a> in effect led to the suspension of the English season, and when the Belgian league was curtailed early because of the virus, Guardiola made contact with Kompany to see if he might be open to a City return.</p> <p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/16/vincent-kompany-interview-anderlecht-manchester-city-belgium-donald-mcrae\">enduring a difficult season in Belgium</a> \u2013 Anderlecht have financial problems, were in eighth place when the season ended, and Kompany had his initial job title of head coach withdrawn due to a lack of the appropriate coaching qualification \u2013 the 34-year-old defender indicated a preference for staying with his boyhood club, primarily because he wishes to keep on playing.</p> <p>Opportunities to do that were already becoming scarce in Manchester by the time Kompany ended his 11-year stint with City at the end of last season, and persistent injuries were restricting his appearances anyway.</p> <p>After signing off in some style with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/06/manchester-city-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\">goal against Leicester</a> that finally tilted the 2018-19 title race City\u2019s way, Kompany even managed to miss his own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/11/vincent-kompany-homelessness-charity-manchester-city-testimonial\">charity testimonial game</a> the following season through injury.</p> <p>With two years to run on his contract at Anderlecht, he feels he will be able to prolong his playing career in the slightly less demanding Belgian league, as well as easing himself into management at the club where he made his name before moving to Hamburg and then Manchester. If he ever changes his mind he is likely to find the City door open, but for now Guardiola\u2019s search for a new permanent assistant will continue.</p>",
  "<p>On Friday the CNN journalist Omar Jimenez was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/george-floyd-protest-updates-05-28-20/h_4ed08403663fa4ed3518221d0f2a1552\">arrested</a> on live television as he covered protests of police brutality in Minneapolis, Minnesota.&nbsp;Jimenez identifies as African American and Hispanic, and when the cops confronted him, he did just what minority parents tell their kids to do.&nbsp;Jimenez cooperated; he was respectful, deferential even.&nbsp;He said: \u201cWe can move back to where you like \u2026 We are getting out of your way \u2026 Wherever you want us, we will go.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/30/america-must-listen-to-its-wounds-george-floyd-they-will-tell-us-where-to-look-for-hope\">America must listen to its wounds. They will tell us where to look for hope | Reverend William Barber</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It didn\u2019t matter;&nbsp;the police officers put handcuffs on him and led him away, and then came back to arrest his crew.&nbsp;Jimenez narrated his arrest as they led him away.&nbsp;His voice is steady.&nbsp;His eyes, though.&nbsp;Jimenez is masked so his eyes are the only clue to what he\u2019s feeling.&nbsp;His eyes are perplexed and terrified.&nbsp;I get it.&nbsp;When a black or brown person goes into police custody, you never know what is going to happen.&nbsp;You just know that when you leave police custody, if you are lucky enough to leave, you will be diminished.&nbsp;That is the point.&nbsp;</p> <p>What\u2019s&nbsp;most interesting is not that Jimenez and his colleagues were released shortly thereafter without any charges filed (or even being told why they had been taken into custody). That\u2019s what class will buy a black man in America. You don\u2019t get it quite as bad as your lower-income brethren.&nbsp;Jeff Zucker, the CNN president, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/george-floyd-protest-updates-05-28-20/h_4285f79616fbc4a7966ab7239b388bf6\">talked</a> to Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, and the crew was quickly released.&nbsp;With an apology&nbsp;from the governor, not the cops. Cops rarely apologize, especially to black men.</p> <p>But what\u2019s most interesting is what happened to Josh Campbell, a white CNN journalist who was in the same area as Jimenez and not arrested. Campbell <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/george-floyd-protest-updates-05-28-20/h_9023ffd063def0b1af22cb3ecdc72a06\">said</a> his experience was the \u201copposite\u201d of Jimenez\u2019s.&nbsp;The cops asked him \u201cpolitely to move here and there\u201d.&nbsp;\u201cA couple times I\u2019ve moved closer&nbsp;than they would, like,&nbsp;they asked politely to move&nbsp;back.&nbsp;They didn\u2019t pull out the&nbsp;handcuffs.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a cliche that the US has two systems of justice, separate and unequal, but I prefer the word Campbell used.&nbsp;The US has \u201copposite\u201d systems of justice \u2013 one for white people and another for racial minorities, especially African Americans, Latinx and Native American people.&nbsp;</p> <p>White progressives love to focus on class subordination (I see you, Bernie Sanders!) but there is something sticky about race.&nbsp;Jimenez\u2019s professional status and calm demeanor did not stop the police from treating him like a regular black dude \u2013 the subject of their vast authority to detain and humiliate.&nbsp;They didn\u2019t have an actual reason and they didn\u2019t need one.&nbsp;Jimenez\u2019s dark skin was the offense.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is how powerful a drug white privilege is.&nbsp;Here we have the cops policing a rally protesting police brutality against a black man.&nbsp;Even in that context, when the whole world is watching figuratively, and CNN\u2019s audience is watching literally, the cops can\u2019t help themselves.&nbsp;They go all brutal lite.&nbsp;They play \u201cwho\u2019s the man\u201d even when the black man, like Jimenez, goes out of his way to show he already knows who the man is.&nbsp;\u201cYou are, officer, Sir.\u201d&nbsp;What the cops round up are the usual suspects and the usual suspects are always black and brown.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People ask why would the police treat another human being like this, and the answer must be because they can</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The whole world has seen the sordid violent recording where George Floyd narrates, over 10 minutes, his own demise.&nbsp;Actually, there is not 10 minutes of narration because Floyd goes limp and silent after several minutes, but that does not cause former officer Chauvin to remove his knee from Floyd\u2019s neck.&nbsp;The officers had received a radio run to go to a local store, where Floyd had allegedly tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill.&nbsp;Floyd is across the street from the store, chilling in his car with a couple of friends, when the officers approach like they are apprehending violent offenders.&nbsp;They order Floyd and his friends out of the car, put Floyd in handcuffs, order him to lie face down on the ground, and pin him down with their knees and hands.&nbsp;Floyd complains he can\u2019t breathe.&nbsp;A cop responds: \u201cWell, get up and get in the car.\u201d</p> <p>&nbsp;I guess that is what you call police humor.</p> <p>People ask why would the police treat another human being like this, and the answer must be because they can.&nbsp;There are rarely consequences.&nbsp;US police officers kill about 1,000 people a year &nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/m62-huddersfield-us-police-shooting-chicago-uk-charts-compare-difference-killings-officers-a7507051.html\">compared</a> with the UK, where in 10 years, law enforcement took a total of 23 lives) and there are rarely consequences.&nbsp;Since 2005, when roughly 15,000 people have been killed by US law enforcement officers, fewer than 150 have been charged with murder.&nbsp;</p> <p>True,&nbsp;the officers in George Floyd\u2019s case lost their jobs, and now face or will face criminal prosecution.&nbsp;This is only because of the video evidence and the high-profile protests.&nbsp;The reality is that, statistically, even these officers are likely to escape conviction.&nbsp;Of the 150 officers charged with homicide in the line of duty, the majority have been found not guilty or had charges dropped.&nbsp;</p> <p>For the moment, we who believe in justice are supposed to be satisfied that one cop, four days after the fact, has been taken into custody, when there are multiple videos of that officer with his knee on the victim\u2019s back as the man complains he can\u2019t breathe.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a black man, and as a former prosecutor, I had no idea it was so difficult to get arrested.&nbsp;US cops arrest about 12,000,000 people a year, but not usually each other.&nbsp;For the rest of us \u2013 I mean the rest of us black and brown people \u2013 we usually get arrested and charged the same day the cops decide we are guilty.&nbsp;The talk our parents give us about how to act around armed agents of the state is designed not so much to prevent arrests as to preserve life.&nbsp;It worked for Omar Jimenez.&nbsp;</p> <p>But not for George Floyd.&nbsp;On the ground, dying, George Floyd pleads for his life, respectful as a person can be when he is asking for mercy from the people who are literally crushing the life out of him. He says \u201cplease\u201d, \u201cofficer\u201d,&nbsp;and calls out to his dead mother.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the police do not remove their knees and feet and hands from Mr Floyd\u2019s body.&nbsp;They don\u2019t even stop restraining him when his body is limp and silent.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One simple reform would be to not allow the cops to make arrests for any non-violent crime</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s to be done?&nbsp;Tinkering with the system makes a difference here and there but it is not enough.&nbsp;If a white woman was thought to have tried to use a fake $20 bill, it\u2019s impossible to imagine the police storming her vehicle, ordering her and her friends out, placing her in handcuffs and ultimately her winding up dead.&nbsp;But as long as cops have that kind of power, people of color will bear the brunt.&nbsp;So one simple reform would be to not allow the cops to make arrests for any non-violent crime. It\u2019s a power they can\u2019t be trusted with, because they will abuse it.</p> <p>In the end, this is not about law enforcement.&nbsp;It\u2019s about enforcing white supremacy.&nbsp;There\u2019s no tinkering with that, what with white supremacy being the foundation on which the country was built.&nbsp;The consistent big question in the quest for racial justice has been how much white supremacy is central to the identity of the US.&nbsp;This is what Barack Obama and Ta-Nehisi Coates argued about.&nbsp;If we had something approaching equal justice, would we still even be the United States?&nbsp;In order to accomplish that we\u2019d have to change the constitution, which authorizes much of the police violence that communities of color complain about, and the politics which exploits white anxiety about black and brown men.&nbsp;</p> <p>What does it mean for people of color to live in a country where, for them to have a fair shot, law and government have to be transformed?&nbsp;It means that we should expect more cases like Omar Jimenez and George Floyd, regardless of whether Trump or Biden wins in November.&nbsp;</p> <p>The real problem, ultimately, is not bad apple cops, even though these four officers are rotten to the core.&nbsp;The real problem is demonstrated in what a bystander <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akzggb/a-cop-kneeled-on-a-black-mans-neck-until-he-said-he-couldnt-breathe-he-died-at-the-hospital\">told</a> the officers as they restrained him to death.&nbsp;\u201cHe\u2019s human, bro.\u201d&nbsp;But Floyd was not human to these officers.&nbsp;Enforcing the dehumanization&nbsp;of people of color has become, in the United States, what you call police work.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Paul Butler is the Albert Brick professor in law at Georgetown University.

  "<p>After hours of peaceful protest over the death of George Floyd, some demonstrators in downtown Atlanta turned violent on Friday night, smashing police cars, spray-painting a sign at CNN headquarters and breaking into restaurants and stores.</p> \n<p>The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting \u201cQuit your jobs.\u201d</p> \n<p>As the violence continued into the small hours of Saturday morning, Georgia\u2019s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GovKemp/status/1266582530234482688\">declared a state of emergency </a>in the city and activated the US national guard.</p> \n<p>The unrest had been triggered by the police killing of Floyd in Minneapolis, which has triggered demonstrations and confrontation across the America and cast a harsh spotlight on US policing\u2019s track record of violence against black men.</p> \n<p>Demonstrators in Atlanta ignored police demands to disperse. Some moved to the city\u2019s major interstate thoroughfare, to try to block traffic.&nbsp;Shops were attacked in a luxury mall, police cars were set on fire and a visitors center at the city\u2019s Centennial Olympic Park&nbsp;was torched.</p> \n<p>Keisha Lance Bottoms, Atlanta\u2019s mayor, addressed the protesters at a news conference: \u201cThis is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. You are disgracing our city.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bottoms was flanked by rappers TI and Killer Mike, as well as King\u2019s daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1b0a8c5c-44b0-420c-914e-ff68aaace720\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FKc1o5mJVnQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe have to be better than this moment.

More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the Omni Hotel was vandalised.</p> \n<p>Atlanta\u2019s police chief said she understood the anger of African American communities across the US over the repeated deaths of black men at the hands of police forces.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhether it\u2019s by police or other individuals, the reality is we\u2019ve diminished the value on their life,\u201d Erika Shields said. </p> \n<p>Speaking as protests raged across American cities over the death of Floyd, Shields added the events in Minnesota were \u201cappalling\u201d.</p> \n<p>Tensions in Atlanta have been running high since the the death of Ahmaud Arbery at the hands of two white men in the state of Georgia in February.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a recurring narrative.

I think it\u2019s getting engaged with people and getting feedback in real time \u2026 Body-worn cameras have been tremendous, because they have shown us how a person is behaving when other people aren\u2019t around.

  "<p><em>Caution: Spoilers ahead</em></p> <p>This has certainly been one of the most interesting and unique seasons of Drag Race ever. Not since the heady days of Willam proudly vomiting off the runway have we had such a memorable ride. The guest judge calibre has been higher than ever (\u201che\u2019s a dinosaur doctor!\u201d) the contestants have been possibly the most talented crop and, in terms of the general progression of the show, things have been messier than ever.</p> <p>As if Sherry Pie-gate weren\u2019t enough, the \u201ccursed\u201d 12th season has now been hit by the shadiest queen ever to grace our world stage, Miss Rona. But they haven\u2019t let this stop them. In true 2020 style, this week\u2019s final has been put together via a wifi-defying combination of video chat, special effects and lots of clever editing. Our three finalists are Jaida Essence Hall, who\u2019s natural destiny in life is to wear ballgowns and be fanned by men holding palm fronds while eating grapes; Gigi Goode, the devil in an a-cup, robotic glamour personified; and Crystal Methyd, somewhere between club kid elegance and an extra from Luc Besson\u2019s Fifth Element. So let\u2019s go!</p> <h2><strong>Bring back. My girls.&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>First, we get a recap of all the girls from season 12. Dahlia Sin\u2019s on a roof! Careful, Dahlia. Aiden Zhane\u2019s looking great but her back garden needs a trim. No, that\u2019s not a euphemism. We think Aiden\u2019s actually going to do very well out of this. She\u2019s got the kind of kooky outsider vibe Drag Race fans love. Meet and greets with lots of tattooed people in polka dot dresses. Opening for Rob Zombie at Download Festival. We can see it now.&nbsp;</p> <p>Next we go to the three finalists and Crystal Methyd is wearing possibly the most avant-garde outfit ever to be seen on Drag Race. An actual, fully-functioning pinata, reminding us of one of our favourite Drag Race drinking games; is it cultural appropriation, or is it just high concept?! Either way, she\u2019s half Mexican so she\u2019s allowed. God, we\u2019re tired.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gigi Goode is stunning as always in a crushed blue velvet Madonna homage. Speaking of Madonna \u2013 we\u2019d like to address her directly. Madge. Have you heard Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cBabylon\u201d yet? If you haven\u2019t, don\u2019t listen. It\u2019s just not worth the aggro. Stick on Schitt\u2019s Creek and have a Twix instead.&nbsp;</p> <p>Jaidia Essence Hall is here, and she\u2019s ALREADY wearing a crown. The audacity is palpable, but Jaida has always been audacious and that\u2019s why we love her. Next, \u201calmost live, from his panic room in the Hollywood Hills\u201d, it\u2019s RuPaul! And he\u2019s ... not ... in ... drag. He wasn\u2019t last week either. We have a controversial theory about this. Social distancing of course means that he can\u2019t have his usual hair and makeup squad flitting around him. Maybe ... he\u2019s ... FORGOTTEN HOW TO DO HIS OWN MAKEUP? That\u2019s pure conjecture of course. Please don\u2019t sue the Guardian, RuPaul.</p> <p>He reveals that this episode will entail three competitive lipsyncs. First, a three-way close-up lipsync where it\u2019s, presumably, all about the lips and getting the lyrics right. Then, a lipsync from home, with each queen choosing a song they feel represents them, complete with homemade backgrounds (this is a great idea) and finally, the top two queens lipsyncing against each other. We head to Carson, Ross and Michelle \u2013 Carson\u2019s home is gorgeous. Books, pianos and drinks everywhere!</p> <p>Next we get some video chat from Whoopi Goldberg and she says \u201cas an entertainer, there are times when we are really necessary ... where no-one can do it better than we can. I think this is one of those times.\u201d Whoopi is right. What entertainers do cannot be replicated. They are having a very tough time during the pandemic. Nightlife and theatre culture have been decimated, it\u2019s impossible for performers to work right now, and performers need to work to survive, not just economically but mentally.</p> <p>Have a think of all the times you\u2019ve yelled with joy and laughed until your sides hurt, while someone fabulous has been on stage in front of you. Much of our culture wouldn\u2019t exist without performers. Drag Race wouldn\u2019t exist without performers. This column wouldn\u2019t exist without performers. If you know any performers, drag or otherwise, show them as much love as you can right now. That\u2019s all.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Crystal Methyd</strong></h2> <p>Not for the first time this season, we\u2019ve entered unprecedentedly surreal territory for Drag Race. RuPaul is inside a giant eyeball, videocalling Crystal, who\u2019s painted completely pink. If you pause it, it looks like a student art project (second year). We get a cute video message from Crystal\u2019s parents. Her dad says her non-english-speaking grandma records the show and gets the family to translate what she\u2019s saying. We\u2019re not crying, YOU\u2019RE CRYING! (Btw Crystal\u2019s grandma, if you watch it on Netflix you can have subtitles, less of a faff, just saying).&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76623951df2c1d0d1b28bab6af134be7a6e63e9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76623951df2c1d0d1b28bab6af134be7a6e63e9d/69_57_1306_783/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drag Race\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHAT. IS. HAPPENING?!</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VH!</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Gigi Goode</strong></h2> <p>We get a mind-bending montage of Gigi Goode\u2019s many stunning looks. She\u2019s undeniably the most cut-glass fashion queen of the season. She addresses the fact that she\u2019s confident, and comfortable in her confidence. Good for you, Gigi! Having healthy self-esteem is nothing to be ashamed of. She says the only performance venue in her hometown was \u201ca substance-free venue with an indoor rock wall\u201d. Oh dear. We cut to Gigi\u2019s mum \u2013 she looks fabulous, stylish, and uses the \u201cthey\u201d pronoun with aplomb. We\u2019d have expected nothing less.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7418081ace477c1260a996ecef18dc540b6766f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7418081ace477c1260a996ecef18dc540b6766f/67_55_1322_793/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drag Race\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gigi\u2019s mum steals the show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VH1</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Jaida Essence Hall</strong></h2> <p>Jaida looks great, in a huge piled wig. We get some truly beautiful video message action from Jaida\u2019s dad and brother, two very stereotypically masculine men, supporting their sibling in something that until recently was very alien to them. \u201cI love you bro.\u201d Aaw. These family video messages are great \u2013 something to carry forward to future seasons perhaps, Covid or no Covid. We also get a nice tribute to Drag Race producer Jacqueline Wilson, who passed away earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc107eb5d929d7616297fb13b0be3b3520599c73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc107eb5d929d7616297fb13b0be3b3520599c73/51_49_1329_798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drag Race\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I love you bro\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VH1</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The Lipsyncs</strong></h2> <p>First it\u2019s the close-up lipsync and this is a bit creepy. They\u2019re leaning in VERY close. Like when your mum tries to use FaceTime. Gigi stands out the most in this, but that might be just because she\u2019s in the middle and has the best camera? Sigh.&nbsp;</p> <p>Next it\u2019s the home lipsync. Crystal Methyd is lipsyncing to Like A Bird by Nelly Furtado and it\u2019s absolutely brilliant. Kids TV show meets acid trip. There\u2019s a giant egg. There\u2019s puppetry. There\u2019s perspective wizardry \u2013 the real genius of this is that she\u2019s made the whole thing seem bigger, by making herself smaller. Next we head to Gigi Goode, with a beautiful and characteristically stylish rendition of Take On Me. Madonna meets Cruella. Jaida\u2019s is the weakest and least inventive by far. To be fair, this isn\u2019t what she signed up for. She shines most on a stage. But she hasn\u2019t adapted or invented as well as Gigi and Crystal.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ru says all three of them are going through to the final lipsync. Get those Zoom backgrounds ready! Suddenly Dolly Parton\u2019s on screen. What\u2019s. Going. On. Nina West presents this year\u2019s Miss Congeniality and a ten thousand dollar prize (!) to Heidi \u2018N\u2019 Closet! Fully deserved.&nbsp;</p> <p>The final lipsync is ... well, it\u2019s an online lipsync from their living rooms. They all do great, but a huge part of lipsyncs is for performers to react to one another and play off each other, so it\u2019s obviously just not the same as it is on stage.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ru crowns the winner, and it\u2019s Jaida Essence Hall! Despite not especially standing out in this particular episode, if you take the whole season into account, it had to be her, really. Accomplished, confident, funny and beautiful. She\u2019s one of the best contestants the show has ever seen and in fact, this has been the best top three the show\u2019s seen in a good few years. Well done, Jaida. Thanks Ru, and thank you all for reading. No matter what else this year has in store, campery and ridiculousness will prevail, we\u2019re convinced of it.</p> <p>Now.
