  "<p>Early research into the first patients critically ill with Covid-19 in UK hospitals indicates that black and Asian people are more likely to be badly affected by coronavirus than white people.</p> \n<p>The Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre <a href=\"https://www.icnarc.org/About/Latest-News/2020/04/04/Report-On-2249-Patients-Critically-Ill-With-Covid-19\">found</a> that 35% of almost 2,000 patients were non-white, nearly triple the 13% proportion in the UK population as a whole.</p> \n<p>Fourteen per cent of those with the most serious cases were Asian and the same proportion were black, according to the study, which has triggered calls for further research to understand why the virus appears to be having a disproportionate impact on non-white ethnic groups.</p> \n<p>The study is thought to be the first analysis of its kind anywhere in the world looking at the ethnic breakdown of cases of the virus. On Tuesday the confirmed number of deaths in NHS services among people with a confirmed case of the virus rose to 6,159 people, with more who died at home, in hospices and in care settings yet to be counted.</p> \n<p>The study examined admissions to a sample of 286 critical care units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland with confirmed Covid-19 up until noon on 3 April. It also showed the median age of those in a critical condition of all ethnicities was 61 and that almost three quarters were men.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"694eca0f-6d8c-491d-b329-2be5c5bcc847\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZYXGxByRUwE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The patients most likely to survive in intensive care were those between 16 and 49, 76% of whom were discharged. The number fell to 50% for those aged 50 to 69, and to 32% for those aged 70 and over.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a signal and it needs to be looked at more carefully,\u201d said Kamlesh Khunti, professor in primary care diabetes and vascular medicine at the University of Leicester, who studies health trends in black and minority ethnic populations. \u201cFor example, South Asians live in more deprived areas and have more cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added South Asian people often lived in larger, multi-generational households and so \u201csocial isolation may not be as prevalent\u201d.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/housing/housing-conditions/overcrowded-households/latest#by-ethnicity\">Government figures</a> confirm that cramped housing is far more likely to be a problem for ethnic minorities.

Fifteen per cent of black African people also live in overcrowded conditions, as do 16% of Pakistanis.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need to ensure that every individual, including the BAME population, are following social distancing instructions,\u201d Khunti said. \u201cWe have anecdotal information that it might not be happening in certain BAME groups.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Other socio-economic factors could be at play too.

  "<p>The news is overwhelming and exhausting in a way it has rarely been in most of our lifetimes, but if you have five minutes of energy left this is worth your attention. That it hasn\u2019t been reported in most of Australia\u2019s major news outlets doesn\u2019t make that any less the case.</p> <p>Across nine days last month, Prof Terry Hughes from James Cook University travelled the length of the Great Barrier Reef in a small plane to survey the health of more than 1,000 individual sites. He was joined by an observer from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, a government agency.</p> <p>Hughes has been here before. It was his work in 2016 and 2017 that told us there had been back-to-back mass bleaching events that ultimately killed an estimated 49% of shallow water corals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/07/great-barrier-reefs-third-mass-bleaching-in-five-years-the-most-widespread-ever\">Great Barrier Reef's third mass bleaching in five years the most widespread yet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His technique sounds uncomplicated, but it relies on sharp observational skills honed over decades. Reefs are filmed, assessed and scored. If 60% of coral on a reef has been drained of its colour it is considered severely bleached. Where possible, the assessments are checked and confirmed in the water.</p> <p>Hughes this week released maps <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/07/great-barrier-reefs-third-mass-bleaching-in-five-years-the-most-widespread-ever\">that show 25% of reefs falling into this category</a>, with another 35% having recorded modest bleaching. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/26/great-barrier-reefs-latest-bleaching-confirmed-by-marine-park-authority\">marine park authority has confirmed</a> it is the third mass bleaching event to hit the global landmark in just five years. It is the most widespread and second most severe episode of its type on record.</p> <p>Crucially, areas that previously escaped bleaching at the southern end, particularly those near or below Mackay, have been badly hit. The affected reefs include those around the Keppel group of islands, where Pauline Hanson was filmed diving in 2016 as she <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-25/pauline-hanson-visits-the-great-barrier-reef-climate-change/8059142\">denied bleaching was a significant problem</a>. Hughes says the coral there is now \u201csnow white\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/05/rescuing-the-great-barrier-reef-how-much-can-be-saved-and-how-can-we-do-it\">Rescuing the Great Barrier Reef: how much can be saved, and how can we do it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The impact of bleaching is now cumulative. Across the three events, in 2016 , 2017 and 2020, reefs along nearly the full length of the 2,300km natural wonder have been severely affected. Some of the staghorn corals in the south this year are expected to die in the months ahead, and turn a scuzzy brown as they are swamped by algae. Others will survive but be less resilient and aren\u2019t likely to make it next time bleaching hits.</p> <p>Unprecedented is a word that gets thrown around so often now that it has lost meaning but it is a clear understatement when describing what has happened here.</p> <p>Look at it this way: when the Australian government last reported to the Unesco world heritage centre on the health of the reef back in 2015 \u2013 a moment that led to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/26/australia-lobbying-to-stop-great-barrier-reef-making-in-danger-list\">extended diplomatic dance by the Coalition government</a> to avoid it being labelled world heritage \u201cin danger\u201d \u2013 there had been only two mass bleaching events in observed history, and none since 2002.</p> <p>Since then, the reef has bleached more years than not. The two most recent events have been in both years when there was no El Ni\u00f1o, the climate cycle in the Pacific that inflates water temperatures.</p> <p>It suggests the underlying global heating is now at a level that an extended spell of warm weather is enough to leave the reef stricken. Next summer is considered a reasonable chance to bring another El Ni\u00f1o on top of that.</p> <p>Hughes took to Twitter on Tuesday to express his heartbreak at again seeing the natural monument he has dedicated his life to studying irrevocably hurt, and raise doubts whether he would make the trip again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ProfTerryHughes/status/1247367294029672448\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;m not sure I have the fortitude to do this again.

It is rare for public officials to speak their minds in ways that may be uncomfortable for their elected overlords but, in an interview with my colleague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/graham-readfearn\">Graham Readfearn</a>, Wachenfeld set out the reef\u2019s plight in clear, blunt language.</p> <p>He described the bleaching as a clear signal the reef was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/07/great-barrier-reefs-third-mass-bleaching-in-five-years-the-most-widespread-ever\">calling for urgent help</a>, warned the resilience of the reef was not limitless and said it would require the \u201cstrongest action possible\u201d on climate change to save it given the planet is headed for 3C heating \u2013 a level at which science tells us coral reefs can\u2019t be protected. </p> <p>That science was summarised by the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which reported a majority of tropical coral reefs <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-3/\">would disappear if heating was limited to 1.5C</a>, and would be \u201cat very high risk\u201d at just 1.2C. The globe has already warmed about 1C since the industrial revolution.</p> <p>The government\u2019s language did not match Wachenfeld\u2019s urgency. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, acknowledged mass bleaching was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and the importance of coordinated global action to cut emissions but said the focus had to be on programs to reduce the pressure on the reef and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/05/rescuing-the-great-barrier-reef-how-much-can-be-saved-and-how-can-we-do-it\">strengthen its resilience</a>.</p> <p>It echoed Scott Morrison\u2019s eventual response to the summer bushfires: conceding the role played by rising emissions but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/29/australia-already-carrying-its-load-on-emissions-and-must-adapt-to-warmer-climate-pm-says\">quickly emphasising adaptation</a> over Australia doing more to tackle the problem at its source.</p> <p>There is another potential path, of course. Written down, it couldn\u2019t sound simpler. It is true that Australia cannot address the climate crisis on its own but it is the world\u2019s 14th biggest emitter and, as Morrison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-news-australia-update-live-stage-2-3-lockdown-nsw-victoria-qld-scott-morrison-restrictions-cases-death-toll-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with%3Ablock-5e7d34a88f0878a2a48ab0ec\">pointed out after he joined a G20 video conference to discuss coronavirus</a>, can be influential in global debates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/04/australias-path-to-net-zero-emissions-lies-in-small-stimulus-friendly-steps\">Australia\u2019s path to net-zero emissions lies in rapid, stimulus-friendly steps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A growing number of analysts and policy experts, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/04/australias-path-to-net-zero-emissions-lies-in-small-stimulus-friendly-steps\">ClimateWorks Australia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/06/ross-garnaut-three-policies-will-set-australia-on-a-path-to-100-renewable-energy\">Ross Garnaut, </a>have suggested in detail that the country could set a jobs-friendly and economically sound course to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/24/net-zero-emissions-by-2050-is-it-a-controversial-ambition-and-will-the-coalition-adopt-it\">net-zero emissions</a>. The stimulus program that will be needed to recover from the pandemic offers a one-shot opportunity to speed up a clean transition.</p> <p>This combination of action at home combined with a new diplomatic effort would give Australia the best chance at saving the reef. At a minimum, Australia\u2019s new role as a climate hawk would point to a future in which the country embraced what will be an inevitable shift to a low-emissions world, rather than be dragged to it.

  "<p>An image of a huge, powerful jet of plasma powered by a supermassive black hole has been captured by researchers in unprecedented detail.</p> <p>The team say the bright blob on the left of the image is thought to be the disc of gas and dust swirling around the black hole, with the jet of plasma depicted by a stream of less intense red features apparently emanating from it.</p> <p>Experts say the jet is part a structure known as a blazar. These are formed from quasars \u2013 supermassive black holes which are actively sucking in material \u2013 that wind up magnetic fields as they spin, resulting in material from around the black hole being shot out in two jets, one of which points towards the Earth.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of that matter [around the black hole] is fated just to cross the event horizon and never return, but some of it can be launched along those powerful magnetic field lines which thread the black hole, and that is what the jet is,\u201d said Dr Ziri Younsi of University College London, a co-author of the study.</p> <p>\u201cBlack holes don\u2019t just swallow up a lot of matter, they spit a lot of it out too because they are highly magnetised and spinning so rapidly,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Crucially, the team say, the image is the highest resolution yet of a jet around a supermassive black hole, meaning the researchers can for the first time investigate what is happening near the base of the jet. Indeed a close-up image shows a blob near the black hole that appears to be slightly off the axis of the rest of the jet.</p> <p>\u201cIt is offset by a good few degrees,\u201d said Younsi.</p> <p>That, he added, means there may be a sort of \u201ckink\u201d at the base of the jet, or material that is being twisted around the jet. Alternatively, the blobs could be part of the edge of the disc of gas and dust that surrounds and feeds the black hole.</p> <p>But, Younsi added, questions remain, including what exactly the plasma of the jet is composed of, and exactly how the jet couples with the black hole.</p> <p>The image, published in the journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, was captured by the Event Horizon Telescope \u2013 a huge research effort involving a network of eight radio telescopes, and a large team of researchers, around the world.</p> <p>The team say the black hole is part of a quasar called 3C 279, and is 200 times larger than the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. The quasar, they add, lies in a galaxy 5bn light years away in the constellation Virgo.</p> <p>\u201cIt is actually very far away,\u201d said Younsi. \u201cNormally we wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything, because the light would just be so red-shifted by the time it reaches us.</p> <p>\u201cBut because this jet is fired almost directly towards us, all of that radiation is boosted and it appears a lot brighter than it really is and so we are able to detect it.\u201d</p> <p>The direction of the jet, pointing towards Earth, also explains another curiosity \u2013 why the jet appears to be travelling 15-20 times faster than the speed of light.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a projection effect,\u201d said Younsi, noting that the is jet actually travelling about 0.995 times the speed of light.</p> <p>The new work is not the first stunning image from the Event Horizon Telescope endeavour: last year the team released the first image of a black hole, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/apr/10/black-hole-picture-captured-for-first-time-in-space-breakthrough\">revealing a glowing halo of gas and dust</a>.</p> <p>But Younsi said the new images were even more exciting to physicists. \u201cIt is the first time we really start to see the connection of the jet with the black hole and the accretion disc [of gas and dust,]\u201d he said. \u201cIt actually allows us to start answering questions about how black holes power jets, how black holes feed, how they grow.\u201d</p> <p>That, he added, is important as not all galaxies have a black hole with large-scale jets \u2013 including our own Milky Way. \u201cOne of the big questions is why \u2013 why don\u2019t we have a big jet like a lot of other galaxies?\u201d said Younsi.</p> <p>Younsi said the new image was a sign of things to come.</p> <p>\u201cThis is just very preliminary work, this is the beginning really,\u201d he said.</p>"
