  "<p>Over the weekend, Black Lives Matter protests brought thousands on to the streets campaigning for an end to Aboriginal deaths in custody.</p> <p>Many signs at rallies referred to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/deaths-in-our-backyard-432-indigenous-australians-have-died-in-custody-since-2008\">the 432 deaths that are known to have happened</a> since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody delivered its final report in 1991.</p> <p>That figure is based on Guardian Australia\u2019s findings from a two-year long project to monitor Aboriginal deaths in custody, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/28/deaths-inside-indigenous-australian-deaths-in-custody\">Deaths Inside</a>.</p> <p>We updated the database and published new results on Saturday. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/06/aboriginal-deaths-in-custody-434-have-died-since-1991-new-data-shows\">We found the number had risen to 434.</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/06/aboriginal-deaths-in-custody-434-have-died-since-1991-new-data-shows\">Aboriginal deaths in custody: 434 have died since 1991, new data shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But by Saturday morning even that number was already out of date. Just before marches began in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/06/australian-black-lives-matter-protests-tens-of-thousands-demand-end-to-indigenous-deaths-in-custody\">Melbourne, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/06/australian-black-lives-matter-protests-tens-of-thousands-demand-end-to-indigenous-deaths-in-custody\"> Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and towns around the country</a>, the department of corrective services in Western Australia confirmed that a 40-year-old Aboriginal man had died in custody at Acacia prison, near Perth.</p> <p>As of Monday, based on reports that have reached us from families and other sources, including coronial reports, we can say that number is now at least 437.</p> <p>Our methodology is explained in full in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/28/deaths-inside-indigenous-australian-deaths-in-custody\">\u201cabout this project\u201d section of Deaths Inside</a>, but we wanted to address the most common questions here.</p> <h2>Why did the Guardian do this project?</h2> <p>We set out to examine what had changed since the royal commission produced its landmark report. We found that little had. People were still dying in the same way, from the same unequal policing, and investigated by coroners who made the same recommendations.</p> <p>Every square in the database is a person and their family, left to navigate a long, complicated and traumatising coronial process. We wanted to tell you the individual stories of each case because the picture they paint, square by square, is so horrifying that many Australians refuse to look at it.</p> <p>When we began this project in late 2017, it was impossible to find up-to-date figures. There was no publicly available, searchable database that acknowledged deaths in custody, even though monitoring was one of the 339 recommendations of the 1991 royal commission. That work is carried out by the Australian Institute of Criminology but its reports are subject to long delays and can be at least four years out of date.</p> <p>Information about deaths that had not yet been subject to an inquest was also hard to find. Prisons often only provided confirmation of a death in custody if requested, meaning that many deaths went unreported.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/28/deaths-inside-indigenous-australian-deaths-in-custody\">Deaths inside: every Indigenous death in custody since 2008 tracked \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And despite evidence in some cases of excessive force or neglect by police or prison officers, there has never been a criminal conviction for a death in custody in Australia. Chris Hurley, the police officer accused of killing Mulrunji Doomadgee on Palm Island in 2004, was acquitted of manslaughter.</p> <p>Two police officers are currently facing murder charges for the deaths of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/13/yuendumu-shooting-nt-policeman-charged-with-over-death-of-indigenous-man\">Kumanjayi Walker in the Northern Territory</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/20/geraldton-shooting-police-officer-arrested-over-death-of-indigenous-woman\">Joyce Clarke in Western Australia</a>, and both have indicated they will plead not guilty.</p> <h2>How did the Guardian arrive at the data?</h2> <p>Deaths Inside lists every Indigenous death in custody we are aware of from 2008 onwards. Where possible the source is a coronial report, but some 20 cases in the database are still awaiting coronal findings. For those cases we have a mix of primary sources, such as statements from police or corrections departments, interviews with family members, lawyers and media reports.</p> <p>To date we have read more than 460 coronial reports, including more than 300 reports on the deaths of non-Indigenous people who died from 2010 to 2015. That five years of non-Indigenous data was used as the basis of a comparative analysis. All reports were tracked across 20 data points.</p> <p>A comparison of case characteristics for Indigenous and non-Indigenous deaths in custody using this data is shown here:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/1591398757562-chart-barGroup.html\" data-alt=\"chart1\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/1591398757562-chart-barGroup.html\">chart1</a> <figcaption>Deaths in custody: case characteristics by Indigenous status, 2010-2015</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Don\u2019t non-Indigenous people die in custody in greater numbers?</h2> <p>That was always the case and never the point.</p> <p>The key finding of the royal commission was that Aboriginal people are more likely to die in custody because they are arrested and jailed at disproportionate rates. That remains as true in 2020 as it was in 1991.</p> <p>One key figure has changed. In 1991, <a href=\"https://aic.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/archive/downloads/npc1991.pdf\">14.3% of the male prison population</a> in Australia was Indigenous. In <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/4512.0March%20Quarter%202020?OpenDocument\">March 2020 it was 28.6%</a>.</p> <p>According to data released by Australian Bureau of Statistics this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2020/jun/07/no-australia-is-not-the-us-our-shocking-racial-injustice-is-all-our-own\">4.7% of all Indigenous men are in jail compared with just 0.3% of all non-Indigenous men</a>.</p> <p>Then, as now, non-Indigenous people died in greater numbers, and at a greater rate, in custody than Indigenous people. But then, as now, Indigenous people made up just 3% of the total population. That means more Aboriginal people are imprisoned and dying as a proportion of their total population.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2020/jun/07/no-australia-is-not-the-us-our-shocking-racial-injustice-is-all-our-own\">No, Australia is not the US. Our shocking racial injustice is all our own | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe conclusions are clear,\u201d royal commissioner Elliott Johnston QC wrote in 1991. \u201cAboriginal people die in custody at a rate relative to the proportion of the whole population which is totally unacceptable and which would not be tolerated if it occurred in the non-Aboriginal community.</p> <p>\u201cBut this occurs \u2026 because the Aboriginal population is grossly over-represented in custody.

Wiradjuri woman Rebecca Maher, Broome woman Maureen Mandijarra, and a 51-year-old man from Kalgoorlie, whose name is withheld for cultural reasons, all died in police cells after being put there for their own safety.</p> <p>We read many reports of non-Indigenous people dying in horrific circumstances, from suicide, shootings or car chases. But we did not read of a single non-Indigenous person who died after being imprisoned for their own safety.</p> <p>And while the most common cause of death for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in custody was medical issues, or what coronial reports refer to as \u201cnatural causes\u201d, Indigenous people were less likely to have been given all of the medical care they needed prior to their death.</p> <p>Our 2018 analysis found that 34% of Indigenous people were denied all appropriate medical care before their death, compared with 25% of non-Indigenous people. Indigenous women were the worst affected, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/10/indigenous-women-in-custody-more-likely-than-men-to-have-died-where-policy-not-followed\">50% not receiving all the medical care they needed.</a></p> <h2>Why didn\u2019t Deaths Inside record the reason a person was in custody?</h2> <p>Australia does not have the death penalty for any offence, therefore the offence a person committed, or is alleged to have committed, is not relevant.</p> <p>Moreover, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/30/more-than-half-of-147-indigenous-people-who-died-in-custody-had-not-been-found-guilty\">we found that 56% of Indigenous people and 51% of non-Indigenous people who died in custody between 2010 and 2015 were not serving a prison sentence</a> but were instead held on remand, were fleeing police, or were killed during arrest.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact is that the royal commission released almost three decades ago said that to stop Aboriginal deaths in custody we must stop putting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in prison,\u201d the Change the Record co-chair and CEO of the national Aboriginal legal service (Natsils), Cheryl Axleby, said.</p> <p>\u201cOverwhelmingly state and territory governments have failed to take the necessary steps to do this.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>For more information on the data and methods used, please&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/28/deaths-inside-indigenous-australian-deaths-in-custody\">read the \u201cabout the project\u201d section here</a></em></p></li> </ul>",

It also owns LBC which includes among its presenters the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, whose on-air criticism of the protests has angered some staff at Capital Xtra.</p> <p>Bokinni and Birch-Campbell said: \u201cHonestly, we are exhausted. As black women in the public eye and forward-facing representatives of this company who are actively speaking out against white privilege and fighting for change, we currently don\u2019t feel like we have the backing of the place we call home. We are more than open to having discussions and being involved in working out how we can move forward.\u201d</p> <p>Staff are also angry at the <a href=\"http://global.com/about/\">lack of diversity on the Global Media board</a>. The company has 10 board members but only gained a female executive at the end of April, with staff now calling for senior representation for black workers.</p> <p>One source at Global said they were \u201csaddened by the lack of genuine commitment to diversity\u201d at the company and claimed: \u201cThere\u2019s never been any genuine commitment to BAME representation or developing female leaders.\u201d</p> <p>The breakfast show presenters issued their statement following staff discussion of comments made by Global founder and president, Ashley Tabor-King, which prompted a lengthy discussion on the company\u2019s internal work discussion forum.</p> <p>When the discussion became strongly critical of Tabor-King and Global\u2019s progress on racial equality, a manager turned the comments off and proposed moving the entire debate from the main group for all staff to a different discussion forum exclusively for staff from a BAME background.</p> <p>This prompted further objections from staff, with one black employee addressing the manager they held responsible for the decision to turn off the comments: \u201cHow can you expect us to have conversations on \u2018positive solutions\u2019 if senior members of staff like yourself are so uncomfortable that they decide to disregard and dismiss the issues that many of us have pointed out?\u201d</p> <p>A Global spokesperson said: \u201cEvery Global employee is now a member of the BAME group on our internal platform and the conversation was not, and is not, limited for anyone.</p> <p>\u201cWe have also taken several steps in recent days, including the formation of a BAME committee, with an appointed independent expert to advise us, in order that faster progress can be made and this evening all our radio brands will hold one minute\u2019s silence so that those suffering, or who have suffered, can be recognised with respect and dignity. All of our outdoor digital displays will concurrently also carry appropriate messaging.</p> <p>\u201cOver the last 12 months, representation for ethnic minorities has increased from 8% to 13%. The Global Academy at which 39% of the students are from a BAME background recently enabled 15 apprentices to start full-time apprenticeships at Global.</p> <p>\u201cAll this said, we recognise there is still a lot of work to do \u2026 Like a lot of businesses, we are honest enough to say that we are still finding our feet and learning fast.\u201d</p>",

But normal has not only left the room, it has left the building and caught the last train for the coast.&nbsp;</p> <p>Employment grew 2.9% in May, but it fell 14.4% in April.

The BLS estimated this meant \u201cthe overall unemployment rate would have been about 3 percentage points higher than reported\u201d \u2013 so 16.3% instead of 13.3%.</p> <p>It is easy in the time of Trump to see political mischief and malfeasance everywhere.&nbsp;</p> <p>But this is not what has happened.&nbsp;</p> <p>What has happened is official statistical bureaus around the world are struggling mightily in this incredibly tough time to make sense of numbers from surveys of people who are also struggling mightily to work out if they are \u201cofficially\u201d employed, on leave, or unemployed even though they are not working and are not looking for work because they have a job to go back to once it re-opens.&nbsp;</p> <p>It would not be surprising if both here and in the US we see numerous revisions of economic data over the coming months. That does not mean the numbers are dodgy, but that we need to take more care than usual about jumping at shadows \u2013 whether it be massive falls or equally massive rises.&nbsp;</p> <p>Keep your head, look at the broader picture and avoid swallowing the spin of politicians<a href=\"xhttps://www.theguardian.com/au\">.</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia</p>",

This ... in my view is racist in itself.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In some respects Patel\u2019s argument echoed that made by another BAME minister, the equalities minister <strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong>, in a Twitter thread at the weekend.

In 2019, attempts to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-47670756\">fix a plaque to the pedestal</a> collapsed after Bristol\u2019s Society of Merchant Venturers, the high priests of the Colston cult, insisted on <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/second-colston-statue-plaque-not-2682813\">watering down the text</a>, adding qualifications that, it was felt, had the effect of minimising his crimes. Yet what repulsed many about the statue was not that it valorised Colston but that it was silent about his victims, those whose lives were destroyed to build the fortune he lavished upon the city \u2026</p> \n   <p>Today is the first full day since 1895 on which the effigy of a mass murderer does not cast its shadow over Bristol\u2019s city centre. Those who lament the dawning of this day, and who are appalled by what happened on Sunday, need to ask themselves some difficult questions. Do they honestly believe that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/bristol\">Bristol</a> was a better place yesterday because the figure of a slave trader stood at its centre? Are they genuinely unable \u2013 even now \u2013 to understand why those descended from Colston\u2019s victims have always regarded his statue as an outrage and for decades pleaded for its removal? </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And here is the full article.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\">The toppling of Edward Colston's statue is not an attack on history.

It explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>From 3 April to 3 May 2020, 5.0% of people said they feel lonely \u201coften or always\u201d, around 2.6m people across Great Britain.

We refer to this group as \u201clockdown lonely\u201d. If we adjusted this to be representative of the entire Great British population this would be equivalent to 14.3%.</p> \n   <p>We investigated measures of loneliness from a range of sources to see whether people are more or less lonely since the lockdown began, and who is most affected.

He may be a disappointment to anyone yearning for some Corbynite passion and radicalism, but even supporters of Boris Johnson\u2019s government would have to admit that gravitas, experience and competence have not been its defining characteristics, and so Starmer has arguable spotted a gap in the market. In this, his first LBC phone-in, he was at it again \u2013 repeatedly stressing his desire for consensus and cooperation. He was strikingly non-partisan.</p> \n  <p>He also sounded very different from his predecessor. During the Labour leadership contest he mostly played down the obvious differences between his politics and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s. But the gap between them is considerable, as was well demonstrated by what Starmer said about the toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol. It is hard to imagine Corbyn describing what happened as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Starmer said that, although the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol should have been removed years go, the manner in which it was pulled down was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.</strong> Asked for his reaction to what happened yesterday, Starmer said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It shouldn\u2019t be done in that way. Completely wrong to pull a statue down like that.</p> \n   <p>But, stepping back, that statue should have been taken down a long, long time ago. You can\u2019t, in 21st-century Britain, have a slaver on a statue.</p> \n   <p>A statue is there to honour people. And you can\u2019t have that in 21st-century Britain. That statue should have been brought down properly with consent and put, I would say, in a museum.</p> \n   <p>This was a man who was responsible for 100,000 people being moved from Africa to the Caribbean as slaves, including women and children who were branded on their chests with the name of the company that he ran. Of the 100,000, 20,000 died en route and they were chucked in the sea. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He defended the decision of the police in Bristol not to intervene.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I was very struck by Superintendent Andy Bennett, who was the police officer, the superintendent, on the ground who judged the situation. And he said he was really disappointed by the vandalism and the bringing down of the statue. But he didn\u2019t think it was the right thing to intervene, because it might make the situation worse.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the Labour MP Barry Gardiner was wrong to attend a Black Lives Matter rally, in breach of social distancing guidelines.</strong> Asked about this, he said Gardiner was \u201cwrong to do it\u201d and that MPs had to lead by example.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Starmer suggested that the government\u2019s 14-day quarantine scheme for new arrivals at airports should be replaced with a testing system for people coming to the country.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the government\u2019s furlough system should be made more flexible, with increased support for workers in particular sectors.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he considered \u201cthe leave/remain divide is over\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He refused to back calls for the post-Brexit transition to be extended.

  "<p>Pressure is mounting on the government&nbsp;to review the national curriculum and make the teaching of black history mandatory for all pupils in schools in England.</p> <p>Campaigners are collecting signatures for an <a href=\"https://www.theblackcurriculum.com/action\">open letter</a> to be sent this week to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, calling on him to make the teaching of black history compulsory in primary and secondary school and across a range of different subject areas.</p> <p>The campaign, led by a group called the Black Curriculum, has attracted widespread support in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests over the killing of George Floyd in the US, and in light of the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on black and minority ethnic people.</p> <p>Organisers have requested a face-to-face meeting with Williamson and want a response by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/18/uk-makes-windrush-day-official-500k-grant-support-events\">Windrush Day</a> on 22 June.</p> <p>The letter states: \u201cThousands of us, the British voting public, are grief-stricken and concerned about the existing status quo in the UK, which disregards the lives and contributions of black British people.\u201d</p> <p>It says young people studying the national curriculum in schools in England are not given a full or accurate version of British history. \u201cDespite numerous calls over the years to reform the national curriculum to incorporate black histories, these requests have been denied,\u201d it says.</p> <p>\u201cLearning black history should not be a choice but should be mandatory. Our curriculum should not be reinforcing the message that a sizeable part of the British population are not valued.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners want black history to be included in the national curriculum from key stage 1 in primary through to key stage 4 when students take their GCSEs, and across subjects including history, citizenship, English and PSHE (personal, social, health and economic education).</p> <p>Lavinya Stennett, who founded the Black Curriculum, said: \u201cThere\u2019s an appetite for change. People want to see the events of the past weeks lead to lasting change. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve known is important for a long time. Finally people are listening.\u201d</p> <p>Black history, including topics such as migration, belonging and empire, can be taught as part of the history and English curriculum in secondary schools, but&nbsp;whether pupils&nbsp;get to study it depends on&nbsp;the exam board and modules chosen by schools.</p> <p>Another challenge is that academies, which are not controlled by local authorities, have greater freedoms and are not required to follow the national curriculum, meaning many children may miss out on opportunities to study black history.</p> <p>Labour has promised that pupils will be taught about injustice and the role of the British empire as part of the national curriculum if it wins power.</p> <p>Black history is also studied and celebrated in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blackhistorymonth\">Black History Month</a> every October.</p> <p>Rosamund McNeil, the assistant general secretary of the National Education Union, said: \u201cGovernment needs to be more proactive. It\u2019s time to show leadership on making the curriculum&nbsp;more diverse and more representative. It\u2019s really helpful we have Black History Month in October, but it\u2019s not enough to just do it in one month. We have to ask ourselves why we are not eliminating racism quickly enough.\u201d</p> <p>Catherine West, the Labour MP for Hornsey and Wood Green, has also written to Williamson calling for a review on the issue. She said she had been contacted by hundreds of her constituents complaining about the \u201ccomplete lack of BAME history\u201d in the curriculum and the ineffectiveness of the education system in tackling systemic racism.</p> <p>\u201cWhilst changing our education system will not necessarily bring an end to racism in the UK, I firmly believe this is an important step in beginning the process of ensuring racial equity in the UK and will go some way to tackling the issues which have been so widely discussed in the past few days,\u201d West said.</p> <p>Pran Patel, an education consultant who runs <a href=\"http://decolonisethecurriculum.com/\">a campaign to decolonise the school curriculum</a>, said that in the last few days views of his website had risen from 500 a day to 6,000.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThrough no fault of their own, our curriculum leaves one group of children feeling inferior and another group with a sense of superiority. Black children don\u2019t see themselves reflected back, and end up feeling they can\u2019t be the person they see in the inspiring story.\u201d</p> <p>Shaminder Takhar, an associate professor of sociology at London South Bank University, said: \u201cDecolonising the curriculum gives voice to those who have previously been marginalised. Viewed in the context of anti-racist struggles such as BLM in the time of Covid-19, it highlights hierarchy and inequality. It is a move towards a more inclusive society.\u201d</p> <p>It comes as a new art education project, backed by Turner-prize nominated artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/yinka-shonibare\">Yinka Shonibare</a>, is aiming to transform how Britain understands its role in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/29/slavery-abolition-compensation-when-will-britain-face-up-to-its-crimes-against-humanity\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/29/slavery-abolition-compensation-when-will-britain-face-up-to-its-crimes-against-humanity\">transatlantic slave trade</a> by placing sculptures that explore its legacy in UK cities.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theworldreimagined.org/\">The World Reimagined project</a> will see 100 globe-shaped sculptures erected in cities across the UK in the summer of 2022, which will be accessible to local schools, and created by well-known and community-based artists.</p> <p>Founding board member, singer and former EastEnders star, Michelle Gayle, told the Guardian she wanted to create a project that would start conversations about Britain and slavery, and provide an educational element for school and community groups. \u201cIt\u2019s a cog in the wheel of what we need to learn about the truth of British history. Everyone can get involved, meaningfully,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Gayle said the removal of the statue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">of the Bristolian slave trader Edward Colston on Sunday</a> made her realise now was the right time to launch the project. \u201cA lot of people were telling us that Britons are not ready to have this conversation,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThen the statue went down yesterday, and we heard people saying they were not taught enough about slavery. To see hear people talk about it like that made us realise that the difficult conversations are being had now.\u201d</p> <p>A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cRacism in all its forms is abhorrent and has no place in our society. Schools already play a significant role in teaching children about the importance of having respect and tolerance for all cultures.</p> <p>\u201cBlack history is an important topic which schools can teach to children of all ages as part of the history curriculum.&nbsp;Schools can utilise resources from a range of organisations and sources to support teaching black history, including the Black Curriculum.\u201d</p>",

Our society is built upon white supremacy.\u201d</p> <p>McGrath said while the term conjured images of the Ku Klux Klan and Nazis, \u201cwhite supremacy is much subtler than this. In many instances it is the unidentified bias that sits within the majority of us that white people are superior to people of colour.\u201d</p> <p>He went on to urge parents to have \u201can honest and open conversation\u201d with their children, so that they could \u201crecognise the existence of white privilege\u201d.</p> <p>He told the Guardian he had received scores of emails from parents since.</p> <p>\u201cOur private WhatsApp parents\u2019 groups have been filled with positive messages.

When I sent them the letter, they said it was a hard read, and they had a tough period of reflection. But they sent it on to friends and work colleagues. One of my best friends, who is white, and had the least privileged upbringing of anyone I know, runs a pub nearby. He has sent out the letter on his Twitter feed and to his staff. He says he wants his pub to be anti-racist.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt is accepted that there is institutional bias, across the world.

He suggested \u201cincome from the couple\u2019s investments, property rental or pension may also be taken into account, together with their cash savings.\u201d</p> <p>Caroline Coombs, from the campaign group <a href=\"https://www.reunitefamiliesuk.co.uk\">Reunite Families UK</a>, said these suggestions were \u201cabsurd\u201d.</p> <p>She said: \u201cIt\u2019s like battling Goliath, honestly. These are the spouses and children of British citizens. The trauma of forced separation, particularly during a global pandemic, is incredibly challenging \u2013 and what\u2019s worse is, this isn\u2019t going away after lockdown.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cPeople won\u2019t be able to get jobs, and for those who have managed to cling on to one, they\u2019re already working crazy hours to try to meet the requirements for their husband or wife to be with them. Even then, most people still can\u2019t raise the funds. The Home Office needs to bring in a blanket period of time to lower the income requirements, or get rid of them completely.\u201d</p> <p>Nineteen overseas visa application centres are due to reopen by the end of this week \u201cwhere local restrictions allow\u201d. But for spouses in countries where borders remain closed and flights grounded, the possibility of a reunion in the near future appears unlikely. </p> <p>Some couples say the lack of information has been a particular source of frustration. Owen Wibberley left South Korea in early March to begin a new job in Yorkshire, and applied for a spouse visa for his wife, Misun, to follow with their two young children, both dual British-Korean nationals. Misun\u2019s passport is currently being held at a closed visa application centre in Seoul.</p> <p>\u201cThe worst part is not knowing the result of the visa application,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have informed us that a decision has been made but not what the result is. If it has been rejected then we will have spent all this additional time separated for no reason. At least if they could tell us the result then we could make more concrete plans regarding housing and major purchases, but being in a total state of limbo is infuriating.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Colin Yeo, an immigration lawyer, said the government\u2019s limited communication on the issue since the lockdown started was unacceptable.</p> <p>\u201cThe deafening silence from the Home Office is causing huge anxiety for affected couples at what is already a really worrying time. Families need to know whether they are going to have to separate or whether new rules will be introduced enabling them to stay together. We\u2019ve seen all sorts of other non-urgent policy immigration announcements recently, so it is baffling that families are being ignored in this way.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said it had taken a \u201ccompassionate and pragmatic approach\u201d to the spouse visa application process during the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cFamily immigration requirements are being kept under review, including the minimum income requirement, and we will publish further guidance shortly,\u201d they said. \u201cSome visa application centres overseas have reopened with social distancing in place, meaning that passports can be returned and people can now supply biometric information or supporting documents for their visas.\u201d</p>",

This is an intense time for our community, and the most important thing is for us to maintain momentum and not lose sight of how critical it is to pursue long term solutions and commitments, for the sake of our generation, and the next. Our individual pursuits of success and belonging remain, but now more than ever, it\u2019s important to use this movement as fuel to inspire new ways of thinking, building, and growing, together. I believe any great movement starts with a renewal of the mind. I know you\u2019re all thinking, what\u2019s next? Where do we go from here? Because I\u2019m thinking the same shit! Conversations about black businesses, ownership and support are happening, and I will continue to have these conversations with the full intention of birthing ideas that are sustainable and tangible. Let\u2019s increase our knowledge! I\u2019m excited to see an awakening happening in all of us! I\u2019ll continue to use my platform to fight against the injustices and inequalities in our community, no matter what. Nonetheless, one man can\u2019t do it alone - I need you, and we need each other! We need everyone, across industry\u2019s, soci-economic backgrounds, countries, to unite with a shared goal of REAL change. Before the pandemic hit, I visited a few schools in Southwark, to share my journey and to truly understand the minds and needs of our next generation. It was eye opening and inspiring to say the least, and I look forward to continuing this work, and contributing more, once it is safe to do so. I urge the black men of our community, my peers, to do the same. Connecting with our kids and motivating them towards a future that is stronger and brighter, is urgent, and necessary. In the meantime, let\u2019s work on clearing the runway for them, so they can take off, and fly. Love everyone, and stay safe x</a></p> \n   <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/johnboyega/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> John Boyega</a> (@johnboyega) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-06-07T10:17:57+00:00\">Jun 7, 2020 at 3:17am PDT</time></p>\n  </div>\n </blockquote> \n <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/04/john-boyega-anti-racism-speech-wins-praise-star-wars-costars-black-lives-matter\">Boyega won wide praise after his impromptu speech</a> at a Black Lives Matter rally in London on 3 June in support of the widespread protests in the US over the killing of George Floyd. \u201cBlack lives have always mattered,\u201d Boyega said in his speech. \u201cWe have always been important.

Thank you, as always, to those who took the time to reach out on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Twitter</a> and elsewhere. </p> \n  <p>Here are the key developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Minneapolis city council pledged to defund city\u2019s police department. </strong>A veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis city council announced its intent to dismantle the city\u2019s police department and invest in community-led public safety, a move that would mark the first concrete victory in the mounting nationwide movement to defund law enforcement agencies in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. My colleague Sam Levin explains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">here</a> what defunding the police might mean. </li> \n   <li><strong>New York City\u2019s mayor pledged to cut police department funding. </strong>New York City mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department\u2019s funding, shifting the savings to social services.

The man then walks into the crowd with the gun at his side.</li> \n   <li><strong>US attorney general said troops were a last resort. </strong>The US attorney general, William Barr, appeared on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, where he was asked about the decision to have military troops on standby to respond to US citizens exercising their right to protest. \u201cI think our position was common, which was that they should only be deployed ... as a last resort and that we didn\u2019t think we would need them. I think everyone was on the same page,\u201d he said. Reports emerged last week that Donald Trump wanted 10,000 active troops to be ordered on to the streets of America to police the protests. Barr denied that accusation on Sunday. \u201cThe president never asked or suggested that we needed to deploy regular troops at that point,\u201d he said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Thousands marched in Phoenix, Arizona,</strong> where protesters rally not just for George Floyd, but for Dion Johnson<strong>, </strong>a 28-year-old black man who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-minneapolis-minnesota-us-twitter-donald-trump-latest-news-live?page=with:block-5ed1ebe48f084df971c8c71b#block-5ed1ebe48f084df971c8c71b\">shot and killed </a>by an Arizona Department of Public Safety officer.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T07:07:42.569Z\">at 8.07am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edde0218f0883ec2fc1cbb1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:55:45.212Z\">7.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">New York City Mayor pledges to cut police department funding</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department\u2019s funding, shifting it instead to social services. </p> \n  <p>In a tweet from the City of New York shared by the mayor, de Blasio outlines policing reforms, including a plan to \u201cShift funding from NYPD to to Youth and Social Services.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe amount will be finalized with the city council during the budget process,\u201d the statement says:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NYCMayor</a> announces new policing reforms in New York City: <a href=\"https://t.co/aWQgz0NBDK\">pic.twitter.com/aWQgz0NBDK</a></p>\u2014 City of New York (@nycgov) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edddd318f08bd75dbb63dca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:40:20.014Z\">7.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As always, please do get in touch with questions, comments, news and tips from your part of the US on twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">@helenrsullivan</a> or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:41:33.047Z\">at 7.41am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edddbfe8f083999a26dbfa5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:37:07.408Z\">7.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Meanwhile British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted on Sunday that the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178?s=20\">anti-racism protests in the UK</a> were \u201csubverted by thuggery\u201d, after some protestors clashed with police in London: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People have a right to protest peacefully &amp; while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police.

The phrase linked the coronavirus with the ubiquitous and implacable nature of institutional racism. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2013 yet people were prepared to risk being afflicted with coronavirus just so they could express their protest at the chokehold killing of a black man.</p> \n   <p>...</p> \n   <p>What happened to George Floyd isn\u2019t new. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d was uttered by another police victim, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/21/eric-garner-police-chokehold-firing-pantaleo\">Eric Garner</a>, less than a decade ago. But now there has been a crossover protest on a universal scale. This time is different. This time it is epochal.

The majority of the marches, including one with family and children and a meditation, were largely without incident. </p> \n  <p>But later in the evening, a small protest of about a hundred people made their way down Flatbush Avenue and then planned to cross the <strong>Manhattan Bridge</strong> on the pedestrian walkway. Like most protests, there was a group of protestors on bicycle at the front and back of the crowd. As protestors made their way, two or three protestors trailed behind, slowing down a long line of police vehicles going down the street, zig zagging on their bikes. </p> \n  <p>At one point, police officers exited the car with batons in hand before pushing the protestors on their back and chest, telling them to get on the sidewalk. At one point, a cop picked up a bicycle and threw it from a few inches away at the owner.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/anrao/status/1269800141583769600\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just watched two cops in downtown Brooklyn shove two protestors off the road, chucking one guy\u2019s bike at him. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/nycprotest?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#nycprotest</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/VNbfPsdL5t\">pic.twitter.com/VNbfPsdL5t</a></p>\u2014 Ankita Rao (@anrao) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anrao/status/1269800141583769600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 8, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T02:28:21.044Z\">at 3.28am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edd9ee88f0883ec2fc1ca34\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T02:18:43.285Z\">3.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hey there, <strong>Vivian Ho </strong>taking over the blog for <strong>Bryan Graham</strong>. </p> \n  <p>Protesters took to the streets in <strong>San Francisco</strong> and <strong>Oakland</strong> again on Sunday, some on foot and some on bicycle. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BettyKPIX/status/1269785685134733312\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">SF PROTEST: A march began in the Marina and moved to North Beach -

To a colonial, you usually hear this expressed in terms of equality. But it transpires more deeply towards respecting Indigenous autonomy of Indigenous lives. And a recognition that Indigenous land must be returned to Indigenous peoples as a consequence of Terra Nullius and crimes committed against a sovereign people. This is the justice that our people must be accorded if we are to coexist peacefully. The settler state must confess ownership of its historical wrongdoings and abuse of power.

Our messages are now starting to resonate \u2013 to be anti-racist is to be anti-colonial. Settler-colonial Australia must decolonise and transform out of their romanticised history books to a new way of thinking and viewing the world. This must start with the recognition of Indigenous sovereignty. Fact.

This is the aspired outcome. This is black liberation in Australia.</p> <p>Our birthright is to be liberated in our own homelands. Our communities operating under Indigenous legal and knowledge systems should not be feared but embraced. Our culture is the oldest continuing on the planet and a gift to humanity. A pathway together cannot be forged under a collapsing western capitalist-colonial system, but can be reconstructed by enabling Indigenous sovereignty and a new system of governance centred on respecting difference not intolerance. The world is no longer crying out for change but demanding it. The time is now here to be on the right side of history.
