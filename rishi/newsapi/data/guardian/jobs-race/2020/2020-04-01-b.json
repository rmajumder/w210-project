  "<p>These are trying times for the BBC. The government talks about abolishing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc-licence-fee\">licence fee</a>. Certain newspapers compete to haul the programme makers over the coals for various crimes, from \u201cwoke\u201d casting to \u201cmucking around\u201d with classics. There are rumours of declining ratings and mutterings about the muscle of Netflix and Amazon. Add to that a pandemic that has forced some of the corporation\u2019s biggest dramas \u2013 including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/23/it-makes-you-go-oh-my-god-how-line-of-duty-broke-the-laws-of-police-shows\">Line of Duty</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/20/brad-pitt-snoop-dogg-asap-rocky-peaky-blinders-steven-knight-gangster-series\">Peaky Blinders</a> \u2013 to cease production and it would be no surprise to find Piers Wenger in a pessimistic mood. In fact, the opposite is true.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a really mad time,\u201d says the head of BBC drama. \u201cBut it\u2019s also been inspiring in terms of the ingenuity creators, producers and casts are showing to get their shows on screen.\u201d He\u2019s been holding \u201cdaily calls to talk about the longer term impact this crisis will have on the kind of story audiences are most in need of\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ccfb8442c2238c70e07cd89b50bbcb61a7d9676e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccfb8442c2238c70e07cd89b50bbcb61a7d9676e/517_185_1290_1291/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Piers Wenger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Drama for me\u2019 \u2026 Piers Wenger.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Lawrence/Channel 4 Pictures</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There have been talks, too, about how to protect the BBC\u2019s huge swath of freelance talent. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the day talking about how the BBC will support small and medium-sized production companies who will find the closedown particularly challenging \u2013 and how we work with established industry bodies to support freelancers, through a hardship fund or some other means. It\u2019s something we\u2019re taking seriously because, yes, people expect the BBC to do the right thing \u2013 and quite rightly, given the way we\u2019re funded.\u201d</p> \n<p>Wenger is clearly pleased with the swiftness of the corporation\u2019s wider response to the pandemic, from the extended news coverage to an array of educational, health and cultural programming, not to mention the decision to bring back old favourites such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/spooks\">Spooks</a> to iPlayer. \u201cWe need to shape the output \u2013 whether you\u2019re school age, seeking escape, looking for drama at 9pm, or want a comedy that really makes you laugh and reflects the soul of the nation, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/17/this-country-series-three-review-bbc-mockumentary-charlie-and-daisy-may-cooper-cotswolds-comedy\">This Country</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>That said, it\u2019s clear the past few days have brought a sea change. When we first talked, pre-lockdown, Wenger stressed the importance of \u201cdrama for me\u201d, as he called it. \u201cNot me personally, but rather for particular demographics instead of a broad mainstream.\u201d This is theme close to the 47-year-old\u2019s heart. Since leaving Channel 4 as head of drama in 2016, he has worked hard to overhaul how the BBC commissions drama, shifting from the general to the specific, to fulfil \u201cbespoke\u201d viewer needs.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>People take great comfort from watching together with the rest of the nation</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIf you look at work we\u2019ve got coming up this year and compare it with what might have been commissioned for BBC One five or 10 years ago, you would see how we are making drama for a very diverse range,\u201d he said pre-virus. \u201cWe would never underestimate the power of communal viewing, but we have to be flexible in the terms of the way we platform our drama. I feel that our current slate is serving the whole population rather than just super-serving the heartlands.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking now, he admits to a different focus. \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting to see the extent to which audiences are coming together to enjoy shows that have a really strong universal appeal. Whether it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/26/the-repair-shop-we-can-fix-anything-but-a-broken-heart-and-brexit\">The Repair Shop</a> or Ant and Dec\u2019s Saturday Night Takeaway, I think people are taking great comfort from watching together, and knowing they are watching along with the rest of the nation \u2013 whereas up to now, the general trend was to seek out stories that were more bespoke. Audiences will continue to want those very particular pieces, but this period will also be a reminder of the sense of community that television can bring to the nation.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc64d69af754b77fa5ab59e9d7685cc015911788\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc64d69af754b77fa5ab59e9d7685cc015911788/0_263_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the fixers of The Repair Shop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sense of community \u2026 the fixers of The Repair Shop.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Peskett/BBC/Ricochet Ltd</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>So he\u2019s particularly pleased about two upcoming adaptations: David Nicholls\u2019 take on his bestselling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/01/us-david-nicholls-review-fiction\">marriage-in-crisis novel </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/01/us-david-nicholls-review-fiction\">Us</a>, starring Tom Hollander, Saskia Reeves and Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l; and Normal People, which tackles Sally Rooney\u2019s much-admired young-and-in-love second novel. \u201cUs might not be a super-tanker of a show, but it has a lot of heart and a lot to say about family. While Normal People is both a thrilling ride and incredibly emotionally honest. I think audiences will enjoy losing themselves in the lives of its protagonists.\u201d</p> \n<p>Not that he\u2019s back-pedalling his support of the year\u2019s most innovative dramas, including the sleek period crime thriller The Serpent; Michaela Coel\u2019s provocative contemporary drama January 22nd; and Small Axe, Steve McQueen\u2019s anthology series about black British history. Interestingly, all will air on BBC One.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ff30817255e1ea42ce686be0c3705d552a25b77\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ff30817255e1ea42ce686be0c3705d552a25b77/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jenna Coleman and Tahar Rahim in The Serpent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleek \u2026 Jenna Coleman and Tahar Rahim in The Serpent.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roland Neveu/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWhy should a voice like Michaela\u2019s be confined to the margins?\u201d Wenger says. \u201cStories like this and Small Axe haven\u2019t been given the big platform they deserve. We\u2019re looking to give the mainstream audience as much stimulation as we can. It makes sense to embrace the most diverse range of storytellers that we can. Having Michaela and Steve on BBC One in the same year is massive for the BBC.\u201d</p> \n<p>Is he concerned that the lockdown might lead to delays? \u201cWe\u2019re in the very early stages,\u201d he says. \u201cWith Small Axe, Steve has finished shooting and has been editing each episode. We are currently on course, although much will depend on how long the lockdown lasts. Steve has been incredibly pragmatic but there are also obviously things he\u2019s going to be incredibly rigorous about. So it\u2019s hard to say for sure, although the signs are positive.\u201d</p> \n<p>He is, however, prepared for a backlash when the shows do air. The recent adaptation of Malorie Blackman\u2019s best-selling young adult novel Noughts + Crosses, about a world where black people rule over white people, was called a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-8076381/The-BBCs-Noughts-Crosses-recipe-division-Calvin-Robinson-argues.html\">recipe for division</a>\u201d in the Daily Mail. Meanwhile, the casting of Vinette Robinson, who is black, as Mary Cratchit in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/22/a-christmas-carol-review-twee-free-torment-fest-is-a-tonic-for-our-times\">A Christmas Carol</a> led to predictable complaints.</p> \n<p>\u201cOh, the whole woke thing,\u201d says Wenger laughing. \u201cFor us not to choose Vinette Robinson, who was the best actress put up for that part, is like saying there weren\u2019t any black people in London in the 19th century, which is just historically inaccurate among other things.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e3554e3c-0b5d-49a7-ba95-1b1ab3f69e3a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VnfQZLhdeDU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He pauses. \u201cSome people like work to be adapted in a quite conservative way. But, you know, we do that as well. The adaptations of A Suitable Boy [due later this year] and Normal People are extremely faithful to the text because they haven\u2019t been adapted before. There were complaints about A Christmas Carol and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/17/the-war-of-the-worlds-review-doom-dystopia-and-a-dash-of-downton\">War of the Worlds</a> but those stories had been adapted so many times. If we adapted them in their most faithful form, people might ask, \u2018Well, why bother?\u2019 It\u2019s not so much about being deliberately woke as about having a range of approaches.\u201d</p> \n<p>While the pandemic has put talk of cuts and threats to the licence fee on hold, are there still concerns? \u201cOf course. None of us can ignore the discourse around the BBC. For me, conversations about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/05/bbc-facing-funding-cut-as-licence-fee-consultation-launched\">decriminalisation</a> of licence fee non-payment and a subscription model for the BBC just point back in the direction of the importance of being a universal service.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe serve the heartland, but you have to think about young audiences and diverse audiences and audiences across the whole nation to justify the licence fee. Quite often when I\u2019m thinking about what to commission, I think who are the hardest people to convince? Which are the toughest nuts to crack? How can I give them a show that will be irresistible to them?\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4637ea899ab1899bf2e9efb0b298e9ce9e528389\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4637ea899ab1899bf2e9efb0b298e9ce9e528389/0_286_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On course \u2026 Steve McQueen is making Small Axe, a period drama about black British history.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On course \u2026 Steve McQueen is making Small Axe, a period drama about black British history.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/McQueen Limited</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Small Axe, a little-told history that speaks to an audience Wenger feels has been ignored, is crucial in this regard. The first episode of McQueen\u2019s anthology series focuses on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/nov/29/mangrove-nine-40th-anniversary\">Mangrove Nine</a>, a group of black activists who were tried in 1970 for inciting a riot; they had been protesting against police targeting the Mangrove Restaurant in Notting Hill, London, a gathering place for intellectuals and activists. \u201cIt gave me the same visceral thrill as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/mar/06/hunger-reel-history-bobby-sands-hunger-strike\">Hunger</a>. It\u2019s a defining piece of work from Steve McQueen, told with such purpose and drive and anger that you are stopped in your tracks.\u201d</p> \n<p>He hopes it will address the ongoing exodus of black British actors to America. \u201cThe more work like Small Axe, the more work like January 22nd, the more work like Noughts + Crosses, the more we send a positive message that they don\u2019t have to go. Clearly this has been an awfully long time coming. We\u2019ve got to sustain that supply line of work for a bond of trust to build up, so we hang on to that talent.\u201d</p> \n<p>This does not mean ignoring the BBC\u2019s other shows, though. There will still be room for Line of Duty to get viewers across the country wound up, as well as such quietly beautiful family dramas as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/23/the-a-word-review-bbc1-drama-autism\">The A Word</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/23/last-tango-in-halifax-review-a-brilliant-bittersweet-sunday-comfort\">Last Tango in Halifax</a>, not to mention state of the nation shockers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/18/years-and-years-2019-terrifying-tv-show-russell-t-davies\">Years and Years</a>, and epics such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/08/world-on-fire-thrilling-tv-that-shows-the-true-terrifying-cost-of-war\">World on Fire</a>.</p> \n<p>What about a show about a global pandemic? There\u2019s ahuge laugh. \u201cWell, never say never \u2013 though I have to say, a pandemic drama is not what I\u2019d want to watch when I turn on the TV this evening by any means. But if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/russelltdavies\">Russell T Davies</a> phoned me tomorrow and had a completely brilliant genre-busting idea for one, I\u2019d find him very hard to turn down.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>While Hollywood has slowly started to embrace a more diverse landscape, inspirational depictions of African Americans prospering remain an unfortunate rarity. This year\u2019s Oscars drove the point home quite clearly, with Cynthia Erivo as the lone black acting nominee, playing runaway slave Harriet Tubman. The same year saw snubs for Lupita Nyong\u2019o in Us and Eddie Murphy in Dolemite is My Name, both playing more contemporary characters with agency. It added credence to the long-held suspicion that in order for a performance by a black actor to break out, there needs to be some form of abuse or subservience to gain recognition. Previous wins by Octavia Spencer in The Help, Lupita Nyong\u2019o in 12 Years A Slave and Mahershala Ali in Green Book highlight this. Yes, these experiences form a majority of the black experience in America \u2013 but what does it mean that Hollywood is primarily interested in black characters overburdened with obstacles and adversity?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/self-made-review-octavia-spencer\">Self Made review \u2013 Octavia Spencer sparkles in inspiring Netflix drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thankfully, two new works, both on streaming platforms and based on true events, work to combat this trend. The Netflix bio-series Self-Made features Octavia Spencer as haircare entrepreneur Madam CJ Walker and tracks how a black woman became the first self-made female millionaire in a segregated, early-20th-century America. The other is the Apple TV film The Banker, which sees two men become two of the first black bankers in America through clever trickery, astute real estate decisions, and coaching a white man to pose as the face of their business.</p> <p>A common thread linking these two narratives, separated by four decades, is the unique pressures black-owned businesses face in America. Their paths to success and prosperity are neither orthodox nor simple. For Madam CJ Walker and Joe Morris and Barnard Garrett (The Banker\u2019s main characters), making it in America requires not only creativity. There\u2019s also the weighted responsibility of lifting up the entire black community along with you. As Walker exclaims in one scene, pitching her haircare products to a group of black women eager to climb the ladder, \u201cWhen one of us looks good, we all look good!\u201d Walker was noted for hiring and training more than 20,000 black workers for her company. Morris and Garrett issued scores of loans to black business owners which, in the 60s, were unfairly viewed as \u201chigh-risk loans\u201d by white bankers and frequently denied. We\u2019re shown that a black business succeeding results in a black community succeeding too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffa4f5fb6a7bcf30f23dc5848e254c1a45a1fdf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffa4f5fb6a7bcf30f23dc5848e254c1a45a1fdf0/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Octavia Spencer in Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J.

There are scant white characters. So the racism Walker encounters, initially, is internalized within the all-black community she lives in. Back then (and even today), black beauty hair products exalted eurocentric or \u201cmixed\u201d beauty ideals. In the series, Walker\u2019s main competitor is a light-skinned black woman who uses colorism to her financial advantage, telling Walker, who is dark-skinned, \u201cColored women will do anything to look like me. Even if deep down they know they can\u2019t.\u201d Then there were the black men, like the noted activist Booker T Washington, who refused to see a beauty business as seriously advancing the \u201cnegro cause\u201d. The confluence of sexism and racism shines bright.</p> <p>Meanwhile, The Banker\u2019s depiction of black business highlights a common adage within the community \u2013 \u201cYou have to be twice as good to get half of what they have.\u201d \u201cThey\u201d being white people, of course. Barnard Garrett is a gifted businessman able to perform complex calculations in his head while conducting intense contract negotiations. He amasses a small, but substantial, fortune through purchasing properties on the borders of white neighborhoods and leasing them to affluent black renters. But Garrett\u2019s talent for flipping real estate is not good enough. He still encounters white businessmen who are unwilling to take him seriously because of his race in a consciously segregated LA (not a landscape modern viewers may immediately associate with such blatant racism). Garrett\u2019s inability to turn himself into a mogul is not through lack of talent, but lack of opportunity \u2013 a reality numerous people of color were, and still are, forced to contend with.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f2deb1e3efe4aad4372875bedb9a4bc9cbc6b13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f2deb1e3efe4aad4372875bedb9a4bc9cbc6b13/0_0_3504_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Mackie and Samuel L Jackson in The Banker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Mackie and Samuel L Jackson in The Banker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Apple TV+/Kyle Bono Kaplan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While scenes of Garrett and Morris teaching a white handyman (played by Nicholas Hoult) math equations, golfing and the art of fine dining are framed as comedic and lighthearted, prepping him to be their stand-in for business deals, they feel like the manifestation of a deeper, darker reality in America. It\u2019s not just about ideas and talent for black business owners.</p> <p>Black-owned businesses still face serious pressures in America. For one, there\u2019s not a lot of them. In 2012, the Census Bureau <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/newsroom/releases/2015/cb15-209_graphic.jpg\">reported</a> only 9.7% of business owners were black, compared with 83% being white. This has resulted in \u201cbuying black\u201d growing increasingly hard, as explored by Killer Mike in an episode of <a href=\"https://kulturehub.com/killer-mike-black-owned-business/\">his Netflix show Trigger Warning</a>. The rapper/activist gave himself the mission of living off only products and services produced by black-owned businesses \u2013 which proved nearly impossible. Our current moment lacks a modern Madam CJ Walker, despite the purchasing power of black buyers steadily growing: 70% of beauty hair supply stores catering to black hair types are owned by Asian Americans.</p> <p>Hopefully Hollywood expands on these kinds of narratives, which certainly serve more purpose than a \u201cwhite savior\u201d plotline such as that of Green Book. They remind me of black-centric films such as the Ice Cube-led, mid-aughts Barbershop franchise and its spinoff Beauty Shop. Narratives that highlight the important work done in black communities and showcase our entrepreneurial spirit. However, those films were produced for and exclusively marketed to black moviegoers.</p> <p>These later works feel nuanced, yet made for a broader audience, suggesting that a major shift in representation of black narratives might be occurring in Hollywood: a move away from trauma and towards success.</p> <ul> <li><p>Self-Made is now available on Netflix and The Banker is now available on Apple TV+</p></li> </ul>"
