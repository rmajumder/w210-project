That is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</li> \n   <li><strong>International imports and exports have fallen to their lowest level for at least four years</strong>, according to World Trade Organization figures.

that the country has achieved one of the lowest fatality rates among the OECD nations, well below the global average of 6.8%.</p> \n  <p>However, a document published last week from the Civil Register revealed 4,201 deaths in caused by \u201crespiratory disease\u201d between 3 March and 29 April. </p> \n  <p>Compared to data from the Department of Health Statistics and Information (DEIS), this would indicate a 57.2% increase in respiratory deaths from the year before, suggesting that this year\u2019s excess of 2,000+ respiratory-related deaths could be related to the novel coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The information, tweeted by investigative journalist and scholar Alejandra Matus, sparked a frenzy of comment on social media.</p> \n  <p>Within hours of the post going viral, the Health

Thank you for following along \u2013 and, always, to those of you who reached out on Twitter and via email. </p> \n  <p>Here are the most important developments from the last few hours:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Global confirmed cases near 4.9 million. </strong>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 323,286 people are known to have died from Covid-19 while at least 4,897,567 are confirmed as having been infected since the outbreak began. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and statistical recording regimes, as well as suspected undercounting.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump says the US having the highest cases worldwide is a \u2018badge of honour\u2019. </strong>The US president told reporters at a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-cabinet-meeting-17/\">cabinet meeting</a> that the high number of cases in the US \u2013 far higher than any other country \u2013 is a \u201cbadge of honour\u201d, because it means the US is testing the most. Trump told reporters: \u201cYou know when you say that we lead in cases, that\u2019s because we have more testing than anybody else.\u201d He said he looks at the number \u201cin a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/singapore-sentences-man-to-death-via-zoom-call\">Singapore sentences man to death via Zoom call</a>. </strong>A man has been sentenced to death in Singapore via a Zoom video-call for his role in a drug deal, the city-state\u2019s first case where capital punishment has been delivered remotely.Punithan Genasan, a 37-year-old Malaysian, received the sentence for his role in a 2011 heroin transaction on Friday, court documents showed, with the country under lockdown to try to curb one of the highest coronavirus rates in Asia.</li> \n   <li><strong>UN chief praises Africa\u2019s efforts to stem virus. </strong>UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said on Wednesday that the developed world could learn lessons from the preventative measures taken by many African countries to stem the spread of the coronavirus. There have been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths from 88,000 cases of the disease registered throughout the African continent, relatively low numbers compared with over 320,000 deaths worldwide.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil confirms record daily rise in deaths and cases. </strong>Brazil has confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. Hospital officials say more than 85% of intensive care beds in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo are full.</li> \n   <li><strong>Covid-19 crisis will push 60m into poverty says World Bank chief. </strong>Coronavirus shutdowns around the world could undo three years of gains in alleviating poverty, the president of the World Bank has said. David Malpass said that up to 60 million people could be pushed below the poverty line, according to World Bank estimates, as the global economy shrinks by around 5%.</li> \n   <li><strong>US president claims hydroxychloroquine study is \u2018Trump enemy statement\u2019. </strong>Trump claimed a recent US study indicating hydroxychloroquine was not an effective coronavirus treatment was a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-white-house\">\u201cTrump enemy statement\u201d</a>. \u201cIf you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey were very old.

Trump said: \u201cThat was a false study done. Where they gave it very sick people. Extremely sick people. People that were ready to die. It was given by obviously not friends of the administration\u201d . </li> \n   <li><strong>The Covid-19 crisis could push 60 million people into poverty</strong>, the head of the World Bank, David Malpass, said. Malpass said his bank had so far loaned money to about 100 countries, accounting for 70% of the world\u2019s population.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The World Health Organization\u2019s annual assembly passed a resolution on the need to investigate the global response to the pandemic</strong>.

Larger schools will open for other grades at a later date.</li> \n   <li><strong> The Netherlands will press ahead with a further easing of lockdown measures in June</strong> due to a steadily declining number of infections and hospital admissions, its prime minister Mark Rutte has said.The country\u2019s 17 million inhabitants have been living under the lockdown measures for about two and a half months.</li> \n   <li><strong>Rishi Sunak, the UK\u2019s chancellor, said the country is facing \u201ca severe recession the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen\u201d</strong>.

The health ministry confirmed 581 new cases out of 1,200 tests, marking the country\u2019s worst day of the crisis \u2013 the previous high was 414.</li> \n   <li><strong>The border between Canada and the US will remain closed</strong> to non-essential travel until 21 June. The closure was set to expire this week after the two governments announced a 30-day extension of the restrictions last month.</li> \n   <li><strong>Spain reported a death toll below 100 for the third consecutive day</strong>, confirming 83 deaths from coronavirus in the past 24 hours. The latest figures from the health ministry showed the majority of the latest deaths were in some of the hardest-hit areas of the country.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam\u2019s third holiest site, will reopen next week</strong>, authorities said. The Islamic endowment overseeing the site in Jerusalem under Jordanian custodianship had taken the unprecedented step of closing it to worshippers in March.</li> \n   <li><strong>People living within a kilometre of Barcelona\u2019s beaches will be able to return to the sand from Wednesday</strong>, as the local lockdown eases.

  "<p>The latest weekly job figures highlight just how damaging the coronavirus has been to tourism regions and also how even in the face of supposedly better news the situation remains dire.</p> <p>In these bizarre times, it is weird what can be seen as \u201cgood\u201d, as the news came with a media release stating \u201c<a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/6160.0.55.001Media%20Release1Week%20ending%202%20May%202020?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=6160.0.55.001&amp;issue=Week%20ending%202%20May%202020&amp;num=&amp;view=\">slowdown in COVID-19 job losses</a>\u201d.

And sure, that is nowhere near the massive 3.7% drop that occurred in the first week in April. But it is still the biggest drop since then and is equivalent to some 120,000 people losing their jobs in just one week:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Weekly growth of jobs by age\">  <iframe title=\"Weekly growth of jobs by age\" aria-label=\"chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-tseVJ\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/tseVJ/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The slowing, such as it is, is also due mostly to a pick-up in jobs for those under 20. Every other age group \u2013 whether male or female \u2013 saw a greater loss of jobs in the first week of May than in the last week of April.</p> <p>So, yes, it is good that we are not losing jobs at the same speed we did when the shutdowns occurred (not surprising really) but, given that 2% of people in their 30s lost a job in the first week of May \u2013 only slightly down on the worst weekly fall of 2.85% \u2013 it might be a bit early to start relaxing.</p> <p>The increase in jobs for younger workers is likely to be linked to an increase in jobs in the accommodation and food services sector. This is mostly the result of a slight easing of restrictions and also just a bit of a rebound from an incredible drop.</p> <p>Accommodation and food, and the arts and recreation sectors were two of the industries that saw the best job growth in the first week of May but they are also the two which have suffered the biggest overall job losses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Job losses by industry\">  <iframe title=\"Job losses by industry\" aria-label=\"chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-ULX3E\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ULX3E/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Even with a 5% increase in jobs in the first week of May, there are still 27% fewer job in the accommodation and food services industry than was the case at the end of February.</p> <p>That more than one in four jobs in the industry have gone in a month remains utterly shattering to contemplate, and also explains why the job losses are so decidedly varied across the regions.</p> <p>In New South Wales, for example, the Blacktown region has seen the smallest drop in jobs \u2013 down 4% (still astonishingly large), and yet it pales in comparison to job losses on the tourist friendly mid-north coast, which has had nearly 12% of jobs disappear:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Biggest and smallest job losses by region in each state\">  <iframe title=\"Biggest and smallest job losses by region in each state\" aria-label=\"chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-wsrSy\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wsrSy/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Across the country there is a clear sense that the areas that are suffering the most are those most dependent upon tourism \u2013 such as the Gold Coast (down 9%), the Sunshine Cost (down 10.2%) the SA Barossa region (down 9.6%) and Coffs Harbour-Grafton (down 11.2%):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Job losses 14 March to 18 April by region\">  <iframe title=\"Job losses 14 March to 18 April by region \" aria-label=\"Map\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-LxlbC\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LxlbC/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The erratic level of job losses looks set to continue as we move from shutdown to soft reopenings.</p> <p>The latest preliminary <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/8501.0.55.008Main%20Features1Apr%202020?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=8501.0.55.008&amp;issue=Apr%202020&amp;num=&amp;view=\">retail trade figures</a> highlight just how far we have to go before things get back to \u201cnormal\u201d.</p> <p>In March total <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2020/may/10/a-rise-in-retail-sales-is-normally-good-news-but-this-is-not-normal-and-clearly-not-sustainable\">retail trade surged</a> a record 8.5% off the back of panic buying and stockpiling of home goods to use during the shutdown.</p> <p>But in April came the hangover of that splurge and it was a killer. The ABS estimates that retail trade in April plunged nearly 18%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Retail trade\">  <iframe title=\"Retail trade\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-ijupo\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ijupo/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So great was the fall that the spending in April was the lowest it has been in any month since 2015 \u2013 when Australia\u2019s population was some 1.5 million smaller.</p> <p>And while of course there was the big spendathon in March, the combined retail trade in March and April was 1% below the combined amount spent in January and February.</p> <p>What this all means in the context of shopping centres reopening across the country is hard to say. Yes, there may be shops open, but will there be people spending money in them? It is not enough to announce that the economy is open \u2013 the economy actually has to open \u2013 and given how dependent we are on exports, that means open internationally.</p> <p>Tourism looks set to suffer for a long time yet.

There is no real plan how to deal with it,\u201d Blackstock said.</p> <p>Senior Trump administration officials have blamed the disparities on the high incidence among black people of underlying health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) only produced its <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Race_Hispanic\">first set of death statistics by race</a> this week, despite mounting calls for basic information.</p> <p>In the absence of government data, APM Research Lab has stepped into the breach. It now gathers statistics from 40 states, covering almost 90% of the total of 92,128 deaths in the US recorded by <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Johns Hopkins</a>.</p> <p>Andi Egbert, senior researcher at APM Research Lab, said she was astonished that it was left to an independent organization to produce nationwide statistics that should be coming from the federal government. \u201cI won\u2019t speculate about motive, but I can\u2019t believe in a modern economy that we don\u2019t have a mandated, uniform way of reporting the data across states. We are in the midst of this tremendous crisis, and data is the best way of knowing who is suffering and how.\u201d</p> <p>Among the states that are still failing to produce any data on deaths by racial group are Montana, Nebraska, Utah and North and South Dakota.</p> <p>The racial disparities in the US death figures became apparent relatively early on in the pandemic, particularly in large cities where black neighborhoods were hit much harder than wealthier white areas. When New York City produced its first <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-deaths-race-ethnicity-04082020-1.pdf\">racial breakdown</a> of Covid-19 deaths in April it showed that Latino and black New Yorkers, especially in the outer boroughs including Queens and the Bronx, were experiencing death rates that were at least twice those of whites and Asians.</p> <p>New figures from the city\u2019s health department released this week and reviewed by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/nyregion/coronavirus-deaths-nyc.html\">New York Times</a> found that when death rates are ranked by zip code, eight out of the top 10 have majority black or Latino populations.</p> <p>As the pandemic unfolds, some states including <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/michigan-task-force-address-disproportionate-impact-coronavirus-black-communities-n1189121\">Michigan</a> and New York have begun to convene specialist taskforces to grapple with the disproportionate suffering in black communities. But Blackstock said that there remained no sign of the Trump administration stepping up to tackle the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cAt this point we have to assume that the clear lack of guidance from the federal government is going to continue, and that states are going to have to do it for themselves,\u201d she said.</p>",

Benrahma and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/05/brentford-ollie-watkins\">Ollie Watkins</a>, who has been reborn as a No 9, have stolen the headlines but Mbeumo has been remarkably consistent in his debut season in the Championship, contributing 14 goals and six assists and, in some quarters, is considered to possess the most potential. Another Brentford forward, Marcus Forss, proved prolific on loan at AFC Wimbledon, scoring 11 goals in 19 appearances before a hamstring injury curtailed his progress in January.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/20/harrogate-league-two-national-league-anxious-wait-promotion-football-league\">Harrogate's dream of League Two on a knife edge \u2013 along with building plans | Andy Hunter</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Ilias Chair, 22, Queens Park Rangers</strong></h2> <p>Brentford\u2019s \u201cBMW\u201d of Benrahma, Mbeumo and Watkins have made a big impression but so have QPR\u2019s three-pronged attack, with Chair impressing in between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2018/nov/14/eberechi-eze-qpr-championship-football-league-blog\">Eberechi Eze</a> and Bright Osayi-Samuel behind, more often than not, a lone striker. Eze earned his stripes on loan at then League Two Wycombe and Chair added further vim to the first team, scoring five goals in 36 appearances following a fruitful six months at Stevenage last year. Chair was born in Antwerp but is of Moroccan descent, prompting inevitable comparisons to the former Loftus Road favourite Adel Taarabt and, though he is only 5ft 2in, the livewire No 10 packs a punch.</p> <h2><strong>Max Bird, 19, Derby</strong></h2> <p>Phillip Cocu has been spoilt for choice when it comes to academy talent \u2013Jason Knight and, more recently, Louie Sibley have made a splash \u2013 but Bird\u2019s progress has been striking, with Wayne Rooney recently underlining the teenager\u2019s growing importance. \u201cHe\u2019s probably the first name on the team sheet,\u201d said Rooney, adding the midfielder should be on the lips of coaches at St George\u2019s Park. \u201cI\u2019d push to say in the next year he could get an England place \u2013 I think he\u2019s been that good.\u201d Bird trained regularly with the first team under Frank Lampard last season and has enjoyed a run of games since Christmas. Last May he was named the EFL apprentice of the year, an award given to Ryan Sessegnon and Lewis Cook in recent seasons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7af5bb101c7104a7bc6c2d6a72c328e7f2f69839\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7af5bb101c7104a7bc6c2d6a72c328e7f2f69839/0_68_3700_2365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Max Bird (right) in action for Derby against Fulham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Max Bird (right) in action for Derby against Fulham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Hobley/News Images/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Ben White, 22, Leeds</strong></h2> <p>The ice-cool centre-back has barely put a foot wrong this season, playing every minute of every Championship game to help Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s side to top spot. The Brighton loanee excelled in League Two and One at Newport and Peterborough respectively and, after replacing Pontus Jansson at Leeds, he has again relished the jump in standard. White, who was released by Southampton at 16, has been a big hit \u2013 last month a five-year-old Leeds fan offered Brighton \u00a315.07 for the defender \u2013 and his progress has interested Premier League sides. White is a slick operator, composed but mean in the tackle and everything suggests he will take the next step in his stride, too.</p> <h2><strong>Conor Chaplin, 23, Barnsley</strong></h2> <p>With almost 200 games under his belt, Chaplin is not a new kid on the block but the striker has savoured his first taste of the Championship, hitting double figures for the league\u2019s bottom club. Chaplin had doubts over whether he could perform in the second tier but has thrived since Gerhard Struber\u2019s appointment in November; his tally of 12 goals in all competitions is a career best. The 5ft 7in forward burst on to the scene at boyhood club Portsmouth and came close to leaving for Oakwell two years ago before signing for Coventry, only for Barnsley to again come calling last summer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2602f7979b2960f80ba15ea46161a84d7cad44b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2602f7979b2960f80ba15ea46161a84d7cad44b/0_62_3904_2344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barnsley\u2019s Conor Chaplin (right) has thrived in his first Championship season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barnsley\u2019s Conor Chaplin (right) has thrived in his first Championship season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greig Cowie/BPI/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Jude Bellingham, 16, Birmingham</strong></h2> <p>The most obvious name on this list, Bellingham has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2020/feb/20/jude-bellingham-on-the-radar-of-footballs-powerhouses-birmingham-city-midfielder-aged-16\">taken the Championship by storm</a>, with Manchester United and Borussia Dortmund among his biggest admirers. At 14 he was dictating games for Birmingham\u2019s under-18s; at 15 starring for the under-23s; and at 16 years and 38 days he made his first-team debut before, a week later, scoring the winner on his first league start. Technically a first-year scholar on \u00a3145 a week, he plays with a maturity that belies his years. Though he has thrived on the left flank, his exuberance shines through as a box-to-box midfielder in the position those closest to him feel he will spend his career.</p> <h2><strong>Liam Walsh, 22, Coventry</strong></h2> <p>His teammates have nicknamed him Messi, which says a lot about the impact Walsh has made on loan from Bristol City, whose manager, Lee Johnson, said the former Everton youngster needed \u201c40 games on the spin\u201d to become Championship-ready. Together with another Bristol City player, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/15/wales-joe-morrell-ive-watched-every-verratti-video-on-youtube\">Joe Morrell</a>, who has spent the season on loan at Lincoln, Walsh has been one of League One\u2019s standout performers. In November a wonderful solo strike whereby Walsh drove from halfway before fooling three Rochdale defenders and thumping the ball into the top corner had staff purring and the tenacious midfielder\u2019s form has been central to helping Coventry surge to top spot.</p> <h2><strong>Sam McCallum, 19, Coventry</strong></h2> <p>Two years ago the left-back was playing for eighth-tier Herne Bay but, via a week at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/27/jamie-vardy-leicester-academy-non-league\">Jamie Vardy\u2019s V9 academy camp</a>, McCallum is now on Norwich\u2019s books after a breakout season in League One. \u201cIt\u2019s this sort of story that it was set up for,\u201d Vardy said. The defender was released by Gillingham at 15 and has worked tirelessly since seizing his second chance. His athleticism, attitude and technique have impressed Coventry\u2019s coaching staff. In January he joined Norwich\u2019s stable of young talent for an initial \u00a32.5m before being loaned back to Coventry.</p> <h2><strong>Randell Williams, 23, Exeter</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c7961d5afaecaac9c2e15f85bed4e6e5a21ab86b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7961d5afaecaac9c2e15f85bed4e6e5a21ab86b/1128_219_3234_3383/956.jpg\" alt=\"Exeter\u2019s Randell Williams\" width=\"956\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exeter\u2019s Randell Williams is second only to Kevin De Bruyne for assists across the four tiers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry Trump/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Exeter are renowned for developing players and they appear to have polished a rough diamond in Williams, who has 14 assists this season \u2013 only Kevin De Bruyne has more across the top four tiers. The electric winger, who has shone at wing-back, spent time at Tottenham as a youngster and was picked up by Watford after his release by Crystal Palace, but was allowed to depart on a free in January last year. Williams started his career at Tower Hamlets, playing senior football at the age of 15, but more recently helped Wycombe into League One. \u201cHe has a great spring, pace and his standards are unbelievably high,\u201d said the Wycombe manager, Gareth Ainsworth.</p> <h2><strong>Ebou Adams, 24, Forest Green Rovers</strong></h2> <p>An athletic midfielder who shrugs off tackles \u2013 he is the most-fouled player in League Two \u2013 Adams is another player who has worked his way back into the Football League via non-league. The Gambia international grew up in south-east London and joined Norwich from Dartford in 2016 but was released after loan spells at Shrewsbury, for whom he played five matches in League One, and Leyton Orient. Adams signed from Ebbsfleet last summer and has been a major boon in a disappointing season for Forest Green. \u201cWe love him,\u201d said the club\u2019s owner, Dale Vince. \u201cHe is so strong and a fundamental part of our team.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The job retention or<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/19/uk-unemployment-rate-furlough-jobs-market\"> furlough scheme</a>, created by the government, business representatives and trade unions working together, has had no parallel in UK history. It has kept six million people in work, and backfilled seven and a half million jobs. Without it, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e2c0615-f2af-4885-a9bf-78deeb94bc80\">one in three businesses</a> say they would have had to lay off staff; and many workers would have felt compelled to try to continue to work, despite public health guidance requiring them not to.</p> <p>No one imagines that the scheme can continue in its present form indefinitely. While a worthwhile investment to support the economy and ensure millions aren\u2019t without a wage, it is a very costly scheme. It is also inflexible, requiring workers to completely remove themselves from work. And the \u201cmissing\u201d 20% of earnings for those who have been furloughed has pushed many below even the minimum wage.</p> <p>So the question is not whether the furlough scheme should change, but what that change should look like \u2013 especially in a context where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/17/britain-is-at-risk-of-returning-to-80s-levels-of-unemployment\">unemployment is heading up to at least 9%</a>.</p> <p>The chancellor has been slow to take decisions in this area. Since the beginning of the scheme, we have urged him to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/rishi-sunak-coronavirus-rescue-plan-labour-britain-economy\"> allow part-time working</a> \u2013 but now learn that this will not be introduced until the start of August. This sets the UK scheme apart from those in continental Europe, which allow part-time working.</p> <p>Briefings to the press suggest that from the beginning of August, those covered by the scheme will need to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/furlough-qa-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">their employer contribute 40% of their previous wage</a>, or support will be discontinued. If these rumours are correct, this again sets the UK\u2019s scheme apart from other countries, where support has often been linked to the lifting of the lockdown.</p> <p>The practical impact of a uniform employer contribution, in the absence of other forms of support for different sectors, is clear. By the time we get to 1 August, social distancing requirements may still be in place. While it is possible that some restaurants, for example, may be opening by then, they may well need to operate substantially under capacity in order to enforce social distancing. This could mean that the employer could not afford a 40% contribution, and would be forced to lay off staff. And as another example, many manufacturers may still have heavily disrupted supply chains, either in the UK or beyond, by then \u2013 again, preventing them from generating revenue sufficient to pay a 40% contribution. The implications are also clear for those staff who are furloughed because they are shielding for medical reasons, whose employers may no longer wish to support them.</p> <p>Adopting an identikit approach to all workers and all businesses from August neglects these challenges. Above all, it risks creating a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/17/britain-is-at-risk-of-returning-to-80s-levels-of-unemployment\">second, massive wave of unemployment</a>, at a time when the jobs market will be unable to absorb it. This is particularly the case given that jobs in hospitality, catering and tourism are often one of the first routes out of unemployment, especially for the young.</p> <p>A more differentiated approach would, admittedly, pose challenges for the government. Hard choices would need to be made, including how to deal with difficult boundary issues between sectors, timing problems in relation to changes in social distancing, and more conditionality on the scheme to ensure it genuinely support\u200bs employment.</p> <p>However, these political and administrative difficulties are just that \u2013 political and administrative. A far less tractable kind of difficulty would be how to aid those who might become long-term unemployed. \u200b</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/rwss/docs/2011/chapter2.pdf\">Studies following the previous recession</a> in the US indicated how those who became unemployed following the global financial crisis saw their future earnings permanently hampered as a result. The government has perhaps become blas\u00e9 about the impact of unemployment in the UK, given its comparatively low levels recently. However, it\u2019s arguable that a decade of sluggish growth in wages, coupled with above-average inflation, helped insulate us from unemployment \u2013 conditions that are unlikely to persist in this form into the future.</p> <p>Failing to engage with redesigning the furlough scheme, and opting instead for administratively \u201ceasy\u201d options, could leave our country with much higher unemployment, with all the human and economic costs that implies. These hard times require our government to be willing to face up to hard choices, and to show the courage to govern in the country\u2019s long-term interest.</p> <p>\u2022 Anneliese Dodds is the shadow chancellor of the exchequer</p>",
  "<p><em> </em>In July 2017, William Perry Pendley, a crusading conservative attorney, delivered a speech to a group of rightwing activists in North Carolina in which he was completely candid about his ideological commitments.</p> <p>He accused \u201cthe media\u201d of selling \u201ctheir soul to the greens\u201d. <strong> </strong>And after criticizing the Endangered Species Act, he made light of killing endangered species.</p> <p>\u201cThis is why out west we say \u2018shoot, shovel and shut up\u2019 when it comes to the discovery of endangered species on your property,\u201d he said, according to an audio recording of the event obtained by the Guardian. \u201cAnd I have to say, as a lawyer, that\u2019s not legal advice,\u201d he added, as some in his audience quietly snickered at the reference to the illegal extermination, and the burial, of endangered animals.</p> <p>It has been almost three years since he gave those remarks, and Pendley is now the acting director of the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, a powerful agency that oversees more than 240m acres of federal land belonging to the American people, manages mineral resources and is required to comply with environmental laws like the Endangered Species Act.</p> <p>Pendley has helped turn BLM into what one high-level employee, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, called \u201ca ghost ship\u201d in which \u201csuspicion\u201d, \u201cfear\u201d and \u201clow morale\u201d abound, despite the best efforts of career civil servants to support each other.</p> <p>As Pendley and his superiors at the interior department press ahead with an effort to move BLM\u2019s headquarters from Washington DC to Grand Junction, Colorado, the agency has hemorrhaged staff members and lost critical institutional memory, which many critics believe was the true purpose of the relocation effort all along.</p> <p>\u201cA skeleton crew is left\u201d at BLM headquarters, said the employee. \u201cSo few people were able to move west that a lot of people retired early and a lot of people took other jobs, so my ballpark estimate is there is only about 20% of permanent employees left\u201d at headquarters. As a result, the agency is failing to fulfill its most basic duties, like responding to public records requests and conducting oversight of state and regional operations, the staffer added.</p> <p>Environmental and government watchdog groups are now responding with a lawsuit that calls into question the legitimacy of Pendley\u2019s position. Last week a pair of environmental nonprofits sued the interior department, alleging that by repeatedly tapping Pendley as the BLM\u2019s acting director, rather than officially nominating him for the position, the interior secretary has skirted the Senate confirmation process usually required for high-level executive branch appointments, and has violated federal law. </p> <p>\u201cThe illegitimate Pendley appointment is particularly troublesome because he has forcibly moved the BLM Headquarters from Washington DC, to remote western Colorado,\u201d said Peter Jenkins, a senior counsel at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, one of the groups that sued. \u201cIn doing so he uprooted the lives of scores of seasoned BLM staff and disrupted this already strained agency.\u201d</p> <p>An interior department spokesperson defended Pendley\u2019s record.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cad7a5caa1502b7d37e1a714f03eb132adce28b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cad7a5caa1502b7d37e1a714f03eb132adce28b0/0_236_4988_2994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Trump administration rolled back key provisions of the Endangered Species Act, a law credited with saving the gray wolf, bald eagle and grizzly bear.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Trump administration rolled back key provisions of the Endangered Species Act, a law credited with saving the gray wolf, bald eagle and grizzly bear.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Bleier/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMr Pendley brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the department and is committed to carrying out the administration\u2019s priorities and achieving the BLM\u2019s \u2026 mission for the betterment of the American people,\u201d said Conner Swanson, the spokesperson. \u201cMr Pendley has provided a steady hand in facilitating important matters, from the BLM headquarters move west to its response to Covid-19.\u201d Swanson has said that the lawsuit against Pendley is \u201cbaseless\u201d.</p> <p>Pendley, a tall man with a handlebar mustache and a penchant for cowboy boots, has remarked in the past that his \u201cpersonal opinions are irrelevant\u201d to his job at BLM.</p> <p>\u201cI have a new job now. I\u2019m a zealous advocate for my client. My client is the American people and my bosses are the president of the United States and [interior] secretary [David] Bernhardt,\u201d Pendley said during an appearance at <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/william-perry-pendley-climate_n_5da0bcffe4b087efdbaddc0b\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/william-perry-pendley-climate_n_5da0bcffe4b087efdbaddc0b\">conference</a> of the Society of Environmental Journalists in Fort Collins, Colorado, last year. \u201cWhat I thought, what I wrote, what I did in the past is irrelevant. I have orders, I have laws to obey, and I intend to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Pendley has long opposed public lands and wildlife protections. After serving in the Reagan administration in the 1980s, he became the president of the Mountain States Legal Foundation (MSLF), a conservative litigation organization funded by conservative and industry groups including the Charles Koch Foundation and Exxon Mobil, according to research from the watchdog groups Documented and Accountable.US.</p> <p>Under Pendley\u2019s leadership, the firm was a persistent foe of federal land agencies, getting involved in dozens of cases on behalf of industry groups and private landowners to challenge environmental protections implemented by the interior department. </p> <p>Pendley became something of a fixture among the anti-government set, writing numerous books extolling rebellion against public lands and the federal government. He has expressed sympathy in the past for the Bundy family, whose militant agitation against federal land ownership included the armed takeover of the Malheur national wildlife refuge in 2016.</p> <p>He has compared climate change to unicorns because \u201cneither exist\u201d. And in a 2016 National Review <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/01/federal-government-should-sell-western-land-follow-constitution/\">article</a>, he laid out a case that argued for the near-total abolition of federal public lands across the nation.</p> <p>Given his long history of legal advocacy on behalf of extractive industries, Pendley brought with him a 17-page recusal list of past clients, employers and investments<strong> </strong>when he took control of the BLM in 2019. The list included groups such as the American Exploration &amp; Mining Association and the Petroleum Association of Wyoming. It has been nearly impossible for the public to know whether Pendley has abided by his recusal list, however, because the BLM has failed to release his detailed official calendar to the public.</p> <p>Though Pendley has long been a committed conservative, he has not always had kind words for Donald Trump. In a 2016 <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2016/06/13/trump-the-polar-opposite-of-reagan/\">op-ed</a> in the Daily Caller, for instance, he said then-candidate Trump \u201cis not fit to pull off Reagan\u2019s boots\u201d.</p> <p>Apart from Pendley\u2019s role in moving BLM\u2019s headquarters to Colorado, the agency under his leadership has also repeatedly proposed <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2020/04/18/blm-plan-western-colorado-public-land-drilling/\">land management plans</a> that heavily promote the <a href=\"https://missoulian.com/opinion/columnists/lets-stop-giving-oil-and-gas-control-of-public-lands/article_ea8c0d90-3af6-528c-9a88-bf040863059c.html\">energy industry</a>. In March, for instance, conservationists in Montana came out aggressively against a BLM resource management plan that they believe is far too friendly to corporate oil and gas interests, <a href=\"https://billingsgazette.com/lifestyles/recreation/conservationists-launch-fight-against-blms-management-plan-for-central-montana/article_dcdb3503-06a6-58a6-bedf-d396a8f56e1f.html\">according to</a> the Billings Gazette.</p> <p>In a statement issued earlier this year, Representative Ra\u00fal Grijalva, the chairman of the House natural resources committee, expressed his concerns over Pendley.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone who wants our land management agencies to be functional in the future needs to recognize the seriousness of what Secretary Bernhardt, acting director Pendley, and their subordinates are doing.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>They were hailed as stepping up to serve their country, with all the \u201crigorous\u201d and \u201cdetailed\u201d instruction needed for such an important role \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/04/contact-tracing-app-to-be-piloted-on-isle-of-wight-this-week-matt-hancock-says\">but a programme to train thousands of contact-tracers to help control the spread of coronavirus</a> has been described as shambolic and inadequate by recruits.</p> <p>People hired to contact those exposed to someone with Covid-19 and advise them to self-isolate have reported spending days just trying to log into the online system, and virtual training sessions that left participants unclear about their roles.</p> <p>New contact tracers have been told to rely on a two-page script and a list of frequently asked questions, both seen by the Guardian. When one taking part in a training session, run by contact centre company Sitel, asked for guidance on how to speak with somebody whose loved one had died of coronavirus, they were reportedly told to look at YouTube videos on the topic.</p> <p>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said on Monday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/uk-minister-admits-less-than-10-of-contact-tracers-recruited\">21,000 contact tracers had been recruited across England, surpassing the initial target of 18,000.</a> \u201cThey have rigorous training with detailed procedure designed by our experts at Public Health England,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have stepped up to serve their country in their hour of need.\u201d</p> <p>Hancock claimed the government now had \u201cthe elements we need to roll out our national test and trace service: the testing capacity, the tracing capability and the technology\u201d.</p> <p>But one man, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Guardian he had spent three days getting paid, but receiving very little information or training.</p> <p>He said he had applied for a job as a \u201cWork at Home \u2013 Customer Service Adviser\u201d for \u00a310 an hour, which was advertised on the job website Indeed. He got an email checking he had the right software, and then received a call to tell him what the job entailed and ask when he could start.</p> <p>He took part in a day of online training run by Sitel on Sunday, logging on to a remote system where there was one trainer for about 100 other people. \u201cWe had a chat [box] where we could ask him questions, but the first hour and a half of the training was just people writing, \u2018I can\u2019t hear anything\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/contact_trace_app-zip/giv-3902m6WvhumRbMZn/\" data-alt=\"Contact-tracing graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/contact_trace_app-zip/giv-3902m6WvhumRbMZn/\">Contact-tracing graphic</a> <figcaption>Contact-tracing graphic</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe trainer said [the problems] were normal and he\u2019d been taking the sessions since last Wednesday,\u201d said the man. \u201cHe was just being slammed with questions all the way through. He was saying, \u2018guys, I can\u2019t answer all your questions. There are too many of you\u2019. He said at one point, \u2018does anybody know what this job is about?\u2019 No one really had any idea.\u201d</p> <p>The people in the training were told they would be acting as agents in the contact-tracing team, working on behalf of PHE. \u201cYou will be acting as the first point of contact with the contacts of confirmed positive cases of Covid-19,\u201d they were told in a slide presentation seen by the Guardian.</p> <p>They were told they would be calling up confirmed contacts of positive coronavirus cases, recording their data and escalating \u201cmore challenging cases\u201d \u2013 including people who refused to cooperate \u2013 to more senior call handlers.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the full day of training, people were still asking the most basic things. Someone also asked what they should do if they spoke to someone whose relative had died of the virus and he said we should look on YouTube where there are lots of videos about empathy and sympathy when talking to someone,\u201d said the man.</p> <p>\u201cThen I looked at the rota and it said I was starting the next morning at 9am,\u201d he said. He logged in first thing and received a message saying \u201csit tight and wait for us to instruct you\u201d. He did nothing all day, but got an email assuring him he would still get paid and was told that he would be doing more training soon.</p> <p>One woman told the Guardian she had been recruited to be a contact tracer and had spent three days trying and failing to log into the Sitel<strong> </strong>system. \u201cMatt Hancock was saying last night that it was all ready to go,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to the complaints about contact-tracing training, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care \u2013 also speaking on behalf of Sitel \u2013 said that recruits were being trained ahead of the rollout, so were not yet expected to make calls.</p> <p>They said that all applicants were interviewed through a combination of online assessments and telephone screening and had to provide Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) and Right to Work information. They added that a suggestion to use YouTube for advice on how to deal with a bereaved person would be investigated and was not in line with their training.</p> <p>\u201cStaff are trained on data security, customer service, safeguarding vulnerable children and adults, operating procedures, and when to escalate issues among other matters,\u201d they said. \u201cOnly applicants that have passed the training modules and technical tests are allowed to move onto the next stage and start work.\u201d</p> <p>The testimony from contact tracers is the latest sign of problems with the government\u2019s attempt to establish an efficient track, trace and isolate system, to allow the country to return to something close to normal life.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/17/uk-contact-tracing-applicants-wrongly-told-hiring-paused-in-latest-misstep\">On Sunday, </a>ministers were accused by Labour of \u201cmisstep after misstep\u201d after contact tracing applicants were told recruitment was on hold while the government considered an alternative app.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Emails sent by one of the private-sector companies handling the recruitment process, Kent-based HR Go, said: \u201cUnfortunately earlier today the roles were put on hold.
