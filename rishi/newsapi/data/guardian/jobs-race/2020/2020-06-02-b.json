At the end of March, the National Statistics Institute (INE), which calculates figures in a different way, gave Spain\u2019s jobless figure as 3.31 million. </p> \n  <p>These figures do not count those who have been furloughed. Between mid-March and the end of May, a total of 3.7 million people were furloughed under a plan rolled out by the labour ministry. But when the furlough scheme draws to a close as planned at the end of June, unemployment figures could rise again.</p> \n  <p>The government has urged employers not to cut jobs in the six months following the furlough period but layoffs are expected.</p> \n  <p>In May, as the lockdown was eased, the number of new jobseekers in the construction sector fell by almost 7% compared with April. In industry and agriculture, the figure remained stable but it grew by 1.5% in the service sector which has borne the brunt of the crisis, particularly due to the loss of significant numbers of temporary jobs in tourism.</p> \n  <p>In the first quarter, Spain\u2019s unemployment rate jumped to 14.4%, INE figures showed. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates unemployment in Spain could soar to 20.8% in 2020, while the government expects a figure of 19%.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed620748f084df971c8e11c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T09:51:50.518Z\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Concerts have been allowed to restart in <strong>Portugal</strong>, with the country\u2019s prime minister, Antonio Costa, attending a show performed by Bruno Nogueira and Manuela Azevedo in Lisbon last night: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2792c9abee454b49850e79e941da3a2c687fbb83\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2792c9abee454b49850e79e941da3a2c687fbb83/0_124_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portuguese entertainer Bruno Nogueira\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portuguese entertainer Bruno Nogueira performs during his show Deixem o Pimba em Paz at Campo Pequeno Arena in Lisbon on Monday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patr\u00edcia de Melo Moreira/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c035f3b1055a602ea5f3571de64a4bb67138067\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c035f3b1055a602ea5f3571de64a4bb67138067/0_320_4804_2883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa, center, and his wife Fernanda Tadeu applaud as the lights dim for the start of a concert by Portuguese artists Bruno Nogueira and Manuela Azevedo at the Campo Pequeno bullring in Lisbon on Monday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Armando Franca/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fce9a63ca35328c39b8a4bc0a91eed408cf96a7\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fce9a63ca35328c39b8a4bc0a91eed408cf96a7/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People wearing face masks attend a concert in Lisbon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wearing face masks attend the performing show Deixem o Pimba em Paz by Portuguese entertainer Bruno Nogueira at Campo Pequeno Arena in Lisbon on Monday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patr\u00edcia de Melo Moreira/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed61f598f087122eca53e97\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T09:46:02.315Z\">10.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Statistics watchdog criticises government's testing data</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Britain\u2019s statistics watchdog has again warned the health secretary, Matt Hancock, that figures on coronavirus tests remain \u201cfar from complete and comprehensible\u201d.</p> \n  <p>In a strongly-worded letter, Sir David Norgrove, chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, said the way the Government presented the figures appeared to be aimed at showing \u201cthe largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding\u201d.

He is the sixth doctor from Wuhan Central Hospital to have died from the virus, which emerged in the central Chinese city late last year.</p> \n  <p>Cases have dwindled dramatically from the peak in mid-February as the country appears to have brought the outbreak largely under control. The official death toll in the country of 1.4 billion people stands at 4,634, well below the number of fatalities in less populous nations.</p> \n  <p>Wuhan Central Hospital has yet to give a formal statement on Hu\u2019s death. In early February it said some 68 staff members had contracted coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Hu\u2019s condition became a national concern after Chinese media showed images of him with his skin turned black due to liver damage. Fellow doctor Yi Fan showed similar symptoms, but recovered and has since been discharged from hospital.</p> \n  <p>The death of their colleague Li Wenliang in February triggered a national outpouring of grief and rage against the government as he documented his final days on social media. The 34-year-old ophthalmologist was reprimanded by authorities after he warned colleagues about the virus in late December. Beijing has since named him a national martyr, but suppressed much of the dissent and criticism sparked by his death.</p> \n  <p>Other medical whistleblowers at Wuhan Central Hospital - including emergency unit director Ai Fen - have told Chinese media they were punished by authorities for speaking out.</p> \n  <p>China has not released a complete figure of the number of medical worker deaths from Covid-19, but at least 34 medics have been awarded posthumous honours by health authorities.

after multiple government labs had fully decoded it, not sharing details key to designing tests, drugs and vaccines.</p> \n  <p>AP reports that strict controls on information and competition within the Chinese public health system were largely to blame. The news agency says its report is based on internal documents, emails and dozens of interviews. </p> \n  <p>The AP report reads: </p> \n  <p><em>Health officials only released the genome after a Chinese lab published it ahead of authorities on a virology website on 11 January. Even then, China stalled for at least two weeks more on giving WHO the details it needed, according to recordings of multiple internal meetings held by the UN health agency in January all at a time when the outbreak arguably might have been dramatically slowed.</em></p> \n  <p><em>Although the World Health Organization continued to publicly commend China, the recordings obtained by the AP show they were concerned China was not sharing enough information to assess the risk posed by the new virus, costing the world valuable time. </em></p> \n  <p><em>\u201cWe\u2019re currently at the stage where yes, they\u2019re giving it to us 15 minutes before it appears on CCTV,\u201d said WHOs top official in China, Dr Gauden Galea, referring to the state-owned China Central Television, in one meeting.</em></p> \n  <p><em>The story behind the early response to the pandemic comes at a time when the UN health agency is under siege. President Trump cut ties with WHO on Friday, after blasting the agency for allegedly colluding with China to hide the extent of the epidemic. Chinese President Xi Jinping said China has always provided information to WHO and the world in a most timely fashion.</em></p> \n  <p><em>The new information does not support the narrative of either the US or China, but portrays an agency now stuck in the middle that was urgently trying to solicit more data. Although international law obliges countries to report information to WHO that could have an impact on public health, the UN agency has no enforcement powers.

  "<p>On the morning after the general election, Boris Johnson told the country that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50777071\" title=\"\">parliament must change</a>\u201d. No legislature can be expected to be preserved in aspic. There is a need for our systems of governance to be made more pluralistic and representative. However, Mr Johnson has seized an opportunity in a crisis to concentrate power rather than diffuse it. The end of online voting and the quelling of parliamentary debate will reduce the Commons to a rubber stamp for whatever Mr Johnson wants.</p> <p>What is being done away with for the next month is effectively the pivotal role assigned to parliament: the scrutiny that improves the quality of government, which, given <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a803fd4-a3e6-11ea-81ac-4854aed294e5\" title=\"\">the economic and public health emergencies</a> facing the country, has never been needed more. Since early May, a hybrid parliament has been operating. MPs debated proposed laws and voted in virtual divisions. This was considered an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/13/the-guardian-view-on-the-hybrid-parliament-unfinished-business\" title=\"\">imperfect</a> but makeshift arrangement necessary to observe the social distancing guidelines. These rules, instituted to save lives, have not changed.</p> <p>Yet the government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/02/mps-back-westminster-government-parliament\" title=\"\">decided</a> to end remote voting and online interventions in debates. Ministers want only a few dozen MPs in the parliamentary chamber to ask questions, and those who wish to vote must queue up to cast their vote in person at the dispatch box. MPs who have been advised to stay home and shield can no longer take part in debates or votes and will have to rely on their whips to find opponents to pair with. It is wrong that parliament should proceed without provision for remote participation when many elected representatives cannot attend in person.</p> <p>The system was given a dry run on Tuesday \u2013 and was <a href=\"https://news.trust.org/item/20200602163908-rfo4w/\" title=\"\">hardly an advert</a> for parliamentary oversight. Instead of a digital voting system in which all MPs could be involved, we have a ludicrous queueing system in which only two-thirds of parliamentarians can participate. Online voting took 15 minutes, its replacement three times as long. That the new system is slower, more dangerous and less inclusive undermines ministers\u2019 argument that the previous one was not fast enough to deal with the volume of legislation.</p> <p>One suspects that there will now be fewer votes scheduled, which is a step back for democracy. Ministers evidently see no loss in the absent MPs unable to participate in debates on legislation. The message is very clear: we are dealing with a cabinet that is responsive at a stretch to the ruling party, but not to the Commons. Parliamentary democracy is fragile and can easily be disrupted if a powerful group of its members does not accept its rules.</p> <p>A government that controls parliament can suppress information or inquiries which are to its disadvantage, sometimes by refusing to supply information. Team Johnson appears to be both scornful and fearful of scrutiny \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/boris-johnson-sacrifices-top-scientific-advisers-on-altar-of-classic-dom\" title=\"\">silencing</a> scientists who might depart from the script during the damaging Dominic Cummings affair and delaying the publication of the last intelligence and security committee report on Russia. More pertinently, the coronavirus crisis requires an effective parliamentary audit of the far-reaching powers placed in the hands of the executive.</p> <p>It was a former Tory lord chancellor who <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/senate/pubs/occa_lect/transcripts/280203.pdf\" title=\"\">warned</a> that \u201chuman nature being what it is, every human being and every human institution will tend to abuse its legitimate powers unless these are controlled by checks and balances, in which the holders of office are not merely encouraged but compelled to take account of interests and views which differ from their own\u201d. A system was in place that allowed MPs to vote, speak and represent their constituents. In rescinding that, the government has left many voters unrepresented. Mr Johnson betrays a view of the lower chamber as a bystander in governance. A vigilant, inquiring and effective Commons is essential to prevent the misuse of formidable powers in a pandemic. It is extremely bad news for the country that Mr Johnson does not want such a parliament.</p>",

Many condemned the company\u2019s show of solidarity as hollow when taken alongside the existence of a feature that allows users to explicitly discriminate based on race.</p> <p>The company has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/29/wltm-colour-blind-dating-app-racial-discrimination-grindr-tinder-algorithm-racism\">long maintained that the ethnicity filter</a>&nbsp;was useful for minority users who wanted to find people like themselves, rather than enforce racism.</p> <p>\u201cWe decided before we were ready to pull the plug on that, it was a conversation we wanted with our user base,\u201d Grindr\u2019s head of communications told the Guardian in 2018. \u201cWhile I believe the ethnicity filter does promote racist behaviour in the app, other minority groups use the filter because they want to quickly find other members of their minority community.\u201d</p> <p>Grindr isn\u2019t the only dating app which allows users to filter by race, but it is by far the most prominent. Racial discrimination on the app isn\u2019t simply enforced algorithmically, either; a 2015 study of Australian users found that 96% had seen at least one profile that included some form of racial discrimination, \u2018through language such as \u201cNot attracted to Asians.\u201d\u2019 One in eight of those surveyed admitted they themselves included such language.</p> <p>The announcement came on the first day of Pride month, Grindr noted. \u201cWe can still come together in the spirit of Pride, but Pride this year has an added responsibility, a shifted tone, and a new priority that will be reflected in our programming \u2013 support and solidarity for queer people of color and the #BlackLivesMatter movement.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The murder of a 20-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/kurds\">Kurdish</a> man in Ankara has launched a wave of accusations of discrimination in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a> over the mistreatment of the ethnic minority.&nbsp;</p> <p>Bar\u0131\u015f \u00c7akan was visiting a park with a friend in Ankara\u2019s Etimesgut neighbourhood on Sunday night when he asked three men to turn down the volume of the music playing from their car during the evening call to prayer.&nbsp;The friend told police that an argument ensued and \u00c7akan was stabbed in the heart and killed, according to a statement from the Ankara governor\u2019s office on Monday. Three suspects were arrested.</p> <p>Initial news reports quoted a family member as saying that \u00c7akan had been attacked because he had been listening to Kurdish-language music. While \u00c7akan\u2019s father said in later interviews that the assault was not triggered by Kurdish music, the racial overtones of the killing have led to an outpouring of anger on social media, particuarly after a friend and another relative stepped forward on Tuesday to say the family had been pressured to cover up the reason for the fight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nujenari/status/1267305642911465472\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"tr\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cK\u00fcrt halen bu \u00fclkenin zencisidir. &quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bar%C4%B1%C5%9F%C3%87akan?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bar\u0131\u015f\u00c7akan</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/MliTXDzhVX\">pic.twitter.com/MliTXDzhVX</a></p>&mdash; Nujen \ud83c\udf49 (@nujenari) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nujenari/status/1267305642911465472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 1, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Hundreds of messages of solidarity have appeared under the hashtag #BarisCakan, as well as comparisons with the killing of African American <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> at the hands of US police, which sparked the protests currently raging across the US over institutional racism.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThose who plant the seeds of hatred and enmity in the public and those who ban even the discourse on peace, this is the result,\u201d pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democracy party (HDP) official Meral Dan\u0131\u015f Be\u015fta\u015f said in a tweet, referring to the policies of the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP).&nbsp;</p> <p>The HDP says 45 mayors out of a total of 65 municipalities that the party won in local elections in March 2019 have been removed from office to date, with at least 21 imprisoned over accusations of links to the outlawed militant Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK).</p> <p>In reaction to \u00c7akan\u2019s death, Giran Ozcan, another HDP official, quoted Martin Luther King Jr with the words \u201cinjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,\u201d referencing the killing of both Floyd and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/israeli-minister-benny-gantz-apologises-for-police-shooting-of-palestinian-man-iyad-halak\">Iyad Halak</a>, a Palestinian man with autism who was shot and killed by Israeli police in Jerusalem last week.&nbsp;</p> <p>Comments from Interior Ministry spokesperson, \u0130smail \u00c7atakl\u0131, who said that the crime was not racially motivated, and that focusing on the racial dynamic is the work of \u201cprovocateurs\u201d, have also led to allegations of state hypocrisy over the treatment of Turkey\u2019s Kurdish population.&nbsp;</p> <p>Several high-level Turkish officials, including President <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan\">Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a>, have issued statements condemning racist violence in the US in the wake of Floyd\u2019s killing.&nbsp;</p> <p>Around one fifth of Turkey\u2019s 80 million-strong population is Kurdish. Since the creation of the modern state in 1923 various Kurdish insurgent groups have fought for independence from Ankara: until the 1990s the language and many cultural practices were outlawed.&nbsp;In Turkey today, Kurds still face widespread discrimination.</p> <p>The peace process between Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government and the PKK broke down by 2015, engulfing the south-east of the country in violence which has killed at least 4,869 people, according to data compiled by the International Crisis Group.</p> <p>Last week, a library named after Kurdish intellectual Celadet Bedir Khan in the southeastern city of Siirt was demolished and Kurdish-language signage taken down and replaced with Turkish.</p>",

  "<p>In 1919, as soldiers returned from the first world war, many white Americans saw African American men in military uniforms for the first time. That sight, and the challenge it posed to the political, social and economic order, was deeply threatening to them. Groups of armed white men hunted down and slaughtered hundreds of black Americans across the country. The wave of lynchings and race riots came to be known as the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Red_Summer.html?id=2ogt4871j3sC\">Red Summer</a>.</p> <p>The black community did its best to fight back, without protection from the state. In some cases, police actively participated in the lynchings. The US attorney general, A Mitchell Palmer, claimed that leftwing radicals were behind the uprisings \u2013 a false charge and one that further endangered African American lives. Palmer worked for President Woodrow Wilson, an ardent segregationist who screened Birth of a Nation in the White House and <a href=\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/hatred-endorsed-president\">praised</a> the Ku Klux Klan even as it deployed terrorism to keep blacks away from the voting booth. Wilson <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/42977761,%20pages%20691-692\">had been silent</a> while whites slaughtered African Americans in <a href=\"https://www.riverfronttimes.com/newsblog/2017/06/28/first-hand-accounts-show-the-horror-of-east-louis-1917-race-riot\">East St Louis</a> in 1917, and he did little to nothing in 1919 when they again attacked and killed black people, this time on an even more horrific and grisly scale.</p> <p>When African Americans fought back, when they protested, when they made clear they would not quietly accept the destruction of their lives, Palmer mobilized the power of the federal government to brand black unrest as the work of the enemy of the state \u2013 communists. It was his version of peace without justice. To do this he ignored the destructive and violent white supremacy that his president had helped unleash. He remained unconcerned about the bold, brazen killing of black people. And he had no qualms about a criminal justice system in which being black meant the presumption of guilt. </p> <p>More than 100 years later, in the wake of the brutal, merciless killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor \u2013 not to mention an incident in which a white woman attempted to put a black birdwatcher in the crosshairs of the NYPD \u2013 our current attorney general, Bill Barr, does not appear to see injustice.&nbsp;Instead, he sounds much like his ancient predecessor, A Mitchell Palmer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Barr, like Palmer, has largely ignored the continued killing of black people by vigilantes and agents of the state. He has also ignored the root causes of the current uprisings, such as the flat-out refusal of American institutions to address the violence and conditions that create a life where black people cannot breathe. Instead Barr has chosen to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-william-p-barrs-statement-riots-and-domestic-terrorism\">focus his attention</a> on what he characterizes as rioting and \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d. Mimicking <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blames-antifa-riots-minnesota-officials-point-fingers-white-supremacists-dueling-claims\">Donald Trump</a>, and without evidence, he has blamed the current eruption on \u201c<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-william-p-barr-s-statement-death-george-floyd-and-riots\">far-left extremists</a>, using antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence\u201d,&nbsp;and he has warned that he will prosecute these (mostly phantom) anti-fascists. Barr previously said that if communities had the audacity to protest police brutality, they might \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/politics/barr-police.html\">find themselves without the police protection they need</a>\u201d.</p> <p>For his part, Trump has branded the protesters \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/29/tech/trump-twitter-minneapolis/index.html\">thugs</a>\u201d and threatened to have American citizens shot and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/us/politics/trump-threatens-protesters-dogs-weapons.html\">vicious dogs</a>\u201d unleashed on them. On Sunday he tweeted that antifa would be labeled a \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1267129644228247552\">terrorist organization</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Strangely, Barr and Trump did not apply the same threat to the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/michigan-gov-whitmer-wants-ban-guns-capitol-after-armed-anti-n1200296\">armed white men</a> who stormed the Michigan capitol, challenged law enforcement and shut down the government during a pandemic. Trump defined these gun-toting white men as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-protestors-with-guns-in-michigan-capitol-are-very-good-people-2020-5\">very good people</a>\u201d..</p> <p>Despite all the smoke and mirrors and blustering threats, it\u2019s obvious what Trump\u2019s Department of Justice has done \u2013 or not done \u2013 that helped bring us to this horrific moment.&nbsp;It abandoned enforcing <a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/press-release/sherrilyn-ifill-in-cnn-op-ed-we-must-hold-police-departments-accountable-even-if-trump-administration-fails-to-do-so/\">consent decrees</a> with police departments that have a demonstrated history of brutality and discrimination. It refused to collect and monitor the data that would <a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/press-release/the-doj-announces-details-of-the-presidents-law-enforcement-commission-reaffirming-the-civil-rights-concerns-around-its-establishment/\">identify patterns and hotspots of bad policing</a> so that safeguards could be put in place. Equally important, it didn\u2019t shore up the <a href=\"https://archive.thinkprogress.org/civil-rights-division-has-not-filed-a-single-voting-rights-act-case-under-trump-792914a2689a/\">voting rights</a> of American citizens, so they could elect representatives whose policies could protect their lives. Instead, the Department of Justice lent its heft to conservative forces, like <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/justice-department-defends-alabama-absentee-ballot-rule/2020/05/26/5a0c525e-9f9e-11ea-be06-af5514ee0385_story.html\">in Alabama</a>, who were determined to block African Americans from the ballot box even during a pandemic.&nbsp;</p> <p>As in 1919, we are dealing with an America where black and brown people must go into the streets to demand their rights because the institutions of democracy have failed to protect them. In 2020, we have a nation where large swaths of the executive, legislative and judicial branches at the federal and state levels have virtually abandoned millions of American citizens.&nbsp;</p> <p>Why, for instance, did <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/05/07/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-video-prosecutor-arrest-mcmichael/3089040001/\">two district attorneys</a> in Georgia see the video of Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s lynching and decide that there was no wrongdoing, even though the film contradicted and undermined the admitted killers\u2019 statements? Why did it take the snuff film of George Floyd\u2019s death to raise the question of how an officer with <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/28/us/minneapolis-officer-complaints-george-floyd/index.html\">18 complaints against him</a> could still be on the police force to squat with his knee on a man\u2019s neck for eight minutes? Why did Christian Cooper know that if he didn\u2019t film his accuser delivering a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000007159234/amy-cooper-dog-central-park-police-video.html\">Broadway-worthy audition for the 911 dispatcher</a>, his life would have been imperiled? Why after the \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant killings of <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/kathryn-johnston-and-police-system-failure\">Kathryn Johnston</a> in Atlanta, <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2010/09/aiyana-stanley-jones-detroit/\">Aiyan</a><a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2010/09/aiyana-stanley-jones-detroit/\">a Stanley-Jones</a> in Detroit and now <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/society/breonna-taylor-was-murdered-for-sleeping-while-black/\">Breonna Taylor</a> in Louisville, did it take protests, mobilization, righteous anger and the media spotlight to even get an investigation?</p> <p>There is something so wounded in American society, in American institutions, that basic decency, basic commitments to justice, are simply not part of the operating code. Justice should not require a spotlight. Justice should not require an uprising.&nbsp;</p> <p>Of course, the standard response to the uproar about police killing African Americans is the retort about <a href=\"https://www.blackenterprise.com/candace-owens-twitter-rant-about-ahmaud-arbery-riles-fellow-black-conservatives/\">black-on-black crime</a>. That pre-packaged answer ignores that just as more than 80% of blacks are killed by blacks, so, too, are more than <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-09-29/race-and-homicide-in-america-by-the-numbers\">80% of whites killed by whites</a>.&nbsp;Yet we don\u2019t get angst or pathologizing about white-on-white crime. That\u2019s because the narrative about African Americans killing each other is not really motivated by concern about black life; it is a conjuror\u2019s trick to take our eyes off the institutionalized, state-sponsored violence that has rained down on black people. &nbsp;</p> <p>In their intonations about antifa instigators and leftwing radicals, that\u2019s what Barr and Trump \u2013 like Palmer and Wilson before them \u2013 are doing: trying to distract us from state-sponsored or -condoned violence. &nbsp;</p> <p>On the other hand, what blacks did in 1919 to deal with a political structure absolutely hostile to their very existence is exactly what we will and must do now. \u201cPlot, plan, strategize, organize, mobilize,\u201d as the rapper Killer Mike <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/30/21275632/killer-mike-george-floyd-press-conference\">put it</a> \u2013 and vote.

  "<p>The two remaining contenders to buy stricken airline Virgin Australia now face a race against time to secure a binding deal \u2013 and potentially a government bailout \u2013 before the end of the month.</p> <p>On Tuesday Virgin Australia\u2019s administrators, partners at accounting firm Deloitte, said they wanted to receive binding bids from US private equity group Bain Capital and investment group Cyrus Capital Partners.</p> <p>The two were among five groups that on Friday lodged non-binding bids for the airline, which collapsed beneath a $6.8bn pile of debt in April after being paralysed by the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>Crucial to creditor approval will be the attitude of unions keen to preserve as many as possible of the 10,000 jobs at Virgin Australia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/29/potential-virgin-bidders-nervous-about-lack-of-government-support\">Potential Virgin bidders \u2018nervous\u2019 about lack of government support</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unions are largely hostile towards Bain, which has a history in the United States of hostility towards organised labour.</p> <p>Cyrus Capital, which is closely linked to the owner of the Virgin brand, billionaire Richard Branson, is likely to be a more attractive option to unions because it has committed to making sure the Australian airline remains a full-service airline.</p> <p>However, it too plans cuts to services, in line with a plan prepared by the Virgin Australia chief executive Paul Scurrah before the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Unions will meet with administrators on Wednesday with a view to beginning talks with the two shortlisted bidders this week.</p> <p>Before negotiating with labour, the shortlisted bidders will also have to attempt to strike a deal with aircraft leasing companies, financiers and bondholders owed billions of dollars \u2013 all of whom will need to take a hefty haircut if the airline is to fly again.</p> <p>Sources said one key problem was that the airline flies too many different types of planes, which makes some routes inefficient.</p> <p>The administrator Vaughan Strawbridge said he wanted to conclude a sale by 30 June.</p> <p>The airline is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/29/potential-virgin-bidders-nervous-about-lack-of-government-support\">likely to run out of cash by that time</a> and Strawbridge has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/virgin-australia-fresh-call-for-government-bailout-as-stricken-airlines-cash-reserves-dwindle\">previously said</a> the airline will need \u201cinterim funding\u201d to get it through a gap, estimated at between four to six weeks, before creditors can approve any deal at a meeting.</p> <p>Strawbridge said he had been discussing options with the government, which has so far given no indication of whether it is willing to fund Virgin through the gap.</p> <p>Michael Kaine, the national secretary of the biggest union at Virgin Australia, the Transport Workers Union, repeated his pleas for a government lifeline.</p> <p>\u201cThe federal government continues to jeopardise a successful outcome by staying a silent and passive observer rather than assisting the administration process by making clear funding and regulatory commitments to guarantee the future of the airline,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The office of the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has been contacted for comment.</p> <p>Kaine said it was \u201cnow up to the final bidders to show they can follow through on their commitment to ensure the best outcome for the Australian community and Virgin workers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe TWU remains focused on bidders willing to engage constructively with the workforce and its representatives, which are planning to get the fullest possible Virgin back in the sky and which have a strong commitment to staying with the asset for the long term,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Strawbridge said the administrators would \u201cspend the coming weeks facilitating in-depth bidder engagement with the stakeholders of the business and work closely with both preferred bidders in the lead up to binding final offers being received\u201d.</p> <p>He left the door open for exiled potential purchasers to re-enter the race \u2013 or for new contenders to join the process.</p> <p>BGH Capital, Brookfield Asset Management and Indigo Partners also made bids last week.</p> <p>\u201cThere will also be speculation that entities associated with the parties that have not moved into this next phase, as well as others, could become involved in some capacity with the remaining parties,\u201d Strawbridge said.</p> <p>\u201cThat will, of course, be a matter for them.\u201d</p>",

This painting was created around 1927 for a London Midland &amp; Scottish Railway poster. It is one of thousands of posters and poster designs in the Science Museum Group Collection. Wilkinson most famously invented \u2018dazzle\u2019 camouflage as a means to protect British shipping during the first world war. Image: \u00a9 the Norman Wilkinson estate. National Railway Museum/Science &amp; Society Picture Library, 2:C - Nasmyth made his fortune as an engineer and is best known for inventing the steam hammer. But he was also an accomplished artist and astronomer. He was the first to observe that the Sun has an uneven surface \u2013 what we now call granulation \u2013 in 1861. He made careful paintings like this from his observations to share what he called the Sun\u2019s \u2018willow-leaf\u2019 pattern with the scientific community. Image: Science Museum/Science &amp; Society Picture Library, 3:D - Forbes shows female workers making 4.5-inch shells at the Kilnhurst Steel Works of John Baker and Co in Rotherham. The company commissioned this scene \u2018to produce a memento for our women workers\u2019 and each of them received a framed copy. They were nicknamed \u2018canaries\u2019 because of the distinctive yellow colouring of their hair and skin caused by the sulphur used in the production of munitions. Image: Science Museum/Science &amp; Society Picture Library, 4:C - Daykin worked at a pit near Sheffield and produced vivid paintings showing the physical work of mining. He remained a miner despite his artistic success and was killed in 1939 in a mine shaft accident. Here Daykin depicts the miner in the position of Christ on the cross, chained to the seam wall, his pick on the ground beside him, with the scene lit by his lamp. Image: Science Museum/Science &amp; Society Picture Library, 5:A - Spectacularly dressed in a white fur mantle, hat and half-veil, Mrs Sage proudly commemorates her role as \"the first English female aerial traveller\". In homage to her beauty, Vincenzo Lunardi invited her to join his balloon ascent on 29 June 1785 from St George\u2019s Fields, London, offering to take her into the \"blue Paradisian skies\". The party of four proved too heavy for the balloon and two others had to withdraw. Image: Science Museum/Science &amp; Society Picture Library, 6:C - George Earl (1824\u20131908) shows a busy platform scene as a train of East Coast Joint Stock carriages is prepared for departure. You can see groups of passengers and their servants, including a ghillie, an Indian ayah, grooms and footmen. Twenty hunting dogs roam around, including spaniels, setters and pointers. Luggage includes fishing tackle, golf clubs and guns. Beneath the shed roof you can spot advertisements for the Daily Telegraph and Pears Soap. Image: Science Museum/Science &amp; Society Picture Library, 7:D - Skinner produced six paintings recording the contribution of Cammell Laird and Co to steel processing and armaments manufacture during the first world war. They were among a set of 20 commissioned from artists for reproduction as postcards for public sale, in aid of the British Red Cross. File Cutters is the original for postcard No 9 showing women cutting rat-tail files at the Cyclops Steel and Iron Works. Image: Science Museum/Science &amp; Society Picture Library, 8:C - Garratt was a locomotive inspector and amateur artist. The mountainous terrain of South America inspired his design for an articulated locomotive that worked more efficiently on tight, steep curves. He painted this picture of the first Garratt-type locomotive before it had been built and used an engraving of the image on his business stationery. Manchester engineers Beyer, Peacock &amp; Co built more than 1,000 Garratts between 1908 and 1958.

Nature has clearly benefited from several months of dramatically reduced economic activity. From a climate crisis perspective, this drop in emissions is astonishingly close to the 7.6% yearly reduction in emissions that scientists have advised will be necessary during the next decade. And yet none of this is cause for celebration.</p> <p>The resilience of nature is temporary, and will last only as long as the lockdown is enforced. More importantly, the reduction in greenhouse gases is not the result of decarbonising the economy, but the unintended consequence of economic paralysis that has come with painful human consequences and huge costs to lives and livelihoods. This is not what addressing the climate crisis looks like. The thoughtful reduction of greenhouse gases has to be intentional not circumstantial, sustained not temporary. Above all, it must lead to improved human wellbeing, not to human or economic suffering. </p> </blockquote> <p>More here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/covid-low-carbon-future-lockdown-pandemic-green-economy\">Covid-19 has given us the chance to build a low-carbon future | Christiana Figueres</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4be468f084df971c8d581\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T08:45:59.424Z\">9.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Other things reopening today include: cinemas in Thailand:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e80698f6ef448de86c3e44a47a701819819eebb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e80698f6ef448de86c3e44a47a701819819eebb/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers at a cinema in Bangkok, Thailand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wear face mask to help curb the spread of the coronavirus during a movie at the Paragon Cineplex cinema in Bangkok, Thailand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sakchai Lalit/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ikea stores in Britain:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de2811bd75e3f3b290db39236d1a8a853f306d30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de2811bd75e3f3b290db39236d1a8a853f306d30/0_250_4929_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers queue outside an Ikea store in Nottingham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Customers queue outside an Ikea store in Nottingham before it reopens, after the British government relaxed lockdown measures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73254ec01e55b0086c1700fef496e9d91e5f6b79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73254ec01e55b0086c1700fef496e9d91e5f6b79/0_233_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers queue at Ikea in Warrington\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Customers queue at Ikea in Warrington as it re-opens following the lifting of lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And amusement parks in Japan:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a27cb0486663e99e289ebb74ad3ad12f791fa177\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a27cb0486663e99e289ebb74ad3ad12f791fa177/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dolphin performs at Hakkeijima Sea Paradise near Tokyo, Japan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wearing face masks enjoy a dolphin performance as the Hakkeijima Sea Paradise amusement park opens after a two-month closure due to the preventative measures to help curb the spread of the coronavirus in Yokohama near Tokyo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Koji Sasahara/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4bced8f08f5e3730122e2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T08:34:57.780Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Trains are running today in Manila for the first time in two months, as the lockdown is eased in the <strong>Philippines</strong>.

Thank you for following along. My colleague Simon Burnton will be taking on the blog now to continue our round-the-clock coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. </p> <p>A reminder that we have a blog dedicated to the George Floyd protests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/31/george-floyd-protests-latest-news-riots-us-cities-donald-trump-police-brutality-live\">here</a>. </p> <p>Below are the latest developments from the last few hours: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Manila eases lockdown. </strong>Traffic jams and crowds of commuters returned to the Philippine capital on Monday, as Manilla relaxed antivirus measures in a high-stakes gamble to slowly reopen the economy while fighting the coronavirus outbreak. Public transport was still limited and many commuters waited for hours to get a ride despite the government deploying special buses. School classes remain suspended for the next two weeks. Barber shops and beauty salons can open next week at a third of their capacity. The Philippines remains a south-east Asian hotspot for Covid-19, with more than 18,000 infections and 957 deaths.</li> <li><strong>Japan may open doors to travellers from selected countries. </strong>Japan is considering reopening its borders to travellers from selected countries that have low levels of coronavirus infections, as it begins to ease restrictions put in place earlier this year to control the outbreak. As schools, cinemas, sports clubs and department stores reopened in Tokyo on Monday, media have reported that the government is also planning to allow travellers in from Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand in the coming months. There was no immediate comment from the foreign ministry.</li> <li><strong>Hong Kong reports first locally transmitted case in two weeks. </strong>Hong Kong has confirmed its first locally transmitted coronavirus cases in more than two weeks, fuelling concerns over its spread as restrictions on movement are relaxed, Reuters reports. The Centre for Health Protection said on Sunday it was investigating two confirmed cases of coronavirus, taking the number of cases so far to 1,085. Four people have died of the disease in Hong Kong.</li> <li><strong>Wuhan reports zero new asymptomatic cases. </strong>Wuhan, the Chinese city of around 11 million people where the Covid-19 pandemic began, reported no new asymptomatic cases on Sunday, according to Chinese health officials. State media, Xinhua, said on Monday more than 60,000 nucleic acid tests were conducted on Sunday, finding no asymptomatic cases. Mainland China reported 16 new cases overall on Sunday, the highest daily number in three weeks. All were reported as imported cases \u2013 11 in Sichuan province, three in Inner Mongolia, and two in Guangdong. </li> <li><strong>Brazil passes 500,000 Covid-19 cases. </strong>Brazil has reported 16,409 new cases, taking the total of infected cases to 514,849. It keeps the country in second place in terms of infections, behind the US on 1.78 million cases. Brazil has moved into fourth in terms of deaths, with 29,314 fatalities, according to the health ministry. President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the severity of the virus and continued to flout social distancing measures. On Sunday, he rode a horse to a rally calling for the supreme court to be shut down for investigating him. </li> <li><strong>Moscow eases lockdown despite high virus caseload. </strong>Shopping malls and parks are set to reopen in Moscow on Monday as the Russian capital eases coronavirus restrictions despite having the world\u2019s third-largest caseload, with 405,843 infections. The relaxation of the confinement orders in Moscow, the centre of Russia\u2019s outbreak with a population of more than 12 million, comes after President Vladimir Putin announced the epidemic had passed its peak in the country. </li> <li><strong>North Korea to reopen schools. </strong>North Korea will reopen schools this month after shuttering them over the coronavirus pandemic, reports said on Monday. Pyongyang has not confirmed a single infection but has imposed strict rules, including closing its borders and putting thousands of its people into isolation. The new school term \u2013 initially scheduled to start in early April \u2013 has been repeatedly postponed, although some universities and high schools were allowed to resume classes in mid-April. </li> <li><strong>The Queen makes first public appearance. </strong>In the UK, the Queen has been pictured riding in the grounds of Windsor Castle \u2013 her first public appearance since the lockdown began. Windsor is said to be the Queen\u2019s favourite royal residence and she has been photographed over the weekend riding one of her ponies, a 14-year-old Fell pony called Balmoral Fern. The 94-year-old regularly rides in the grounds of Windsor and has been a passionate horse lover and breeder of thoroughbred racehorses throughout her reign.</li> <li><strong>Spain to extend lockdown. </strong>Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, has said the country needs 15 more days of lockdown until 21 June \u201cto finish with the pandemic once and for all\u201d, and that he would ask parliament to approve a final two-week extension to the stay home rule. \u201cWe have almost achieved what we set out to do,\u201d Sanchez told a press conference, as he expressed his intense relief that the number of new cases in Spain, one of the nations hardest-hit by the virus, had fallen dramatically.</li> <li><strong>Bangladesh lifts lockdown. </strong>Bangladesh lifted its coronavirus lockdown on Sunday, with millions heading back to work in densely populated cities and towns even as the country logged a record spike in deaths and new infections. \u201cThe lockdown has been lifted and we are heading almost towards our regular life,\u201d health department spokeswoman Nasima Sultana said, calling on those returning to work to wear masks and observe social distancing. It comes as Bangladesh \u2013 which on Friday took an emergency pandemic loan from the International Monetary Fund \u2013 reported its biggest daily jump in infections Sunday, with 2,545 new cases and a record 40 deaths.</li> </ul> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance-1-june\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T06:13:28.395Z\">at 7.13am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed496248f084df971c8d477\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/davidsmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T05:50:19.600Z\">6.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Not even Donald Trump\u2019s harshest critics can blame him for a virus believed to have come from a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, nor for an attendant economic collapse, nor for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/13/us-slavery-400-years-virginia-point-comfort\">four centuries of slavery,</a> segregation, police brutality and racial injustice.<br></p> <p>But they can, and do, point to how he made a bad situation so much worse.
