As much as we love Poppy, we can\u2019t see how she\u2019ll work and be funny for Snatch Game. This could be curtains for Crystal. RuPaul\u2019s being uncharacteristically human on this walkaround, dispensing sound advice and even hugs.</p> <p>Gigi\u2019s got the genius idea of doing Sophia The Robot and firmly sticks to her guns when RuPaul basically advises her not to do it.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.gardnermuseum.org/calendar/exhibition/bostons-apollo\">Boston\u2019s Apollo</a><a href=\"https://www.gardnermuseum.org/calendar/exhibition/bostons-apollo\">: Thomas McKeller and John Singer Sargent</a>, an exhibition at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, was meant to examine a contradiction of race and visibility. Its intended run, from 13 February to 17 May, was curtailed by the coronavirus outbreak. Fortunately, we are left with a handsome and well-illustrated catalog from Yale University Press.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/08/wilmingtons-lie-review-david-zucchino\">Wilmington's Lie review: race, outrage and the roots of modern inequality</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In eight chapters, leading authorities discuss aspects of a nearly decade-long collaboration between the two men. As each is <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/the-hidden-sargent-39/\">thought to have been gay</a>, the studies raise an unanswered question: were they involved intimately? The catalogue also examines McKeller\u2019s invisibility in light of long-term and widespread demeaning depictions or outright erasures of black people in American art and media, in the service of white supremacy.</p> <p>In 1916, at 60, renowned as a portrait painter, Sargent approached the close of his life. In Boston, he undertook the second of three civic mural commissions, hoping to gain immortal fame by decorating the entrance halls of the Museum of Fine Arts and Harvard\u2019s Widener Library.</p> <p>McKeller was 26 and had worked as a bellhop at Sargent\u2019s hotel. Possessed of a magnificent physique, he became the painter\u2019s preferred model.</p> <p>Sargent\u2019s projects were not without irony. Under Abbot Lawrence Lowell, Harvard was undergoing an <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Court_of_1920\">inquisition</a> to uncover and expel gays. The college president also wanted a <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/10/21/lowell-375-profile/\">quota for Jews</a>, while the university barred black students from campus housing. Harvard would even, for 70 years, credit the library <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/02/recognizing-architect-julian-abeles-contributions-to-harvard/\">not to its black architect</a> but to his white employer.</p> <p>Given all that, it is not surprising that in Sargent\u2019s finished work, McKeller was never depicted as himself.</p> <p>Among allegorical decorations, neither McKeller\u2019s kind eyes nor his placid face look back. Only his supple musculature is faithfully rendered. McKeller is sometimes older, he is intermittently younger, he is sometimes female and he is even divine. But he is always white.</p> <p>The sole exception is a remarkable portrait sketch, painted for the artist\u2019s pleasure over an unfinished image of a bird. Phantom wings make the man a superman. It is quite unlike anything else Sargent ever did.</p> <p>The Gardner is hardly unique in having few African Americans on its staff. For the Sargent-McKeller project, Catherine Morris, a member of the museum\u2019s education department, convened community consultants who saw to black scholars\u2019 inclusion.</p> <p>Helga Davis, visiting curator, conducted interviews with McKeller\u2019s last living relation, Deirdre McKeller O\u2019Bryant. She elicited a crucial bit of family lore. Tom McKeller was suspected to have been gay, and had a greater reason than simple terror to leave Wilmington, North Carolina, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/08/wilmingtons-lie-review-david-zucchino\">the site of a notorious massacre in 1898</a>, and travel north to Boston.</p> <p>Lead curator Nathaniel Silver\u2019s catalogue introduction, meanwhile, indicates how empathy can sometimes make a world of difference. Silver explains the Gardner project as originating from his \u201cdiscovery\u201d of a folio of signed sketches, some showing McKeller, which Sargent presented to his friend, patron and confidante Belle Gardner in 1922. Discerning that some showed the same black man, Silver became curious as to the model\u2019s identity.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://hoodmuseum.dartmouth.edu/news/2015/10/collecting-and-sharing-trevor-fairbrother-john-t-kirk-and-hood-museum-art\">Trevor Fairbrother, an independent art historian</a> who wrote the penultimate catalogue chapter, already knew it was McKeller \u2013 and more besides. He knew the Gardner had published selections from the folio twice before. He was aware that Sargent\u2019s ravishing oil sketch had a prominent position in the artist\u2019s studio but nonetheless spent 70 years in storage.</p> <p>In 1986, it was Fairbrother\u2019s unstinting work that convinced the Boston Museum of Fine Arts to purchase Sargent\u2019s Portrait of a Negro Nude. There it joined works by John Singleton Copley, William Sidney Mount and Winslow Homer, resonant of a conception of not just black humanity but of an African American nobility.</p> <p>Such works have echoes elsewhere, and not only on gallery walls. Not too many years after Sargent worked at Harvard and the Gardner, for example, African Americans in New York City were determined to promote public art espousing racial uplift. Much of the work they commissioned was more publicly visible.</p> <p>In 1937, at the Harlem Court House, murals celebrating American independence and emancipation were commenced by <a href=\"https://imagejournal.org/2017/10/16/arm-girl-guard/\">a Japanese</a><a href=\"https://imagejournal.org/2017/10/16/arm-girl-guard/\"> American painter, Eitaro Ishigaki</a>. Each portrayed black people pursuing freedom, led by Washington and Lincoln.</p> <p>Both, however, were found wanting. The \u201ccommunity\u201d, said local papers, felt Lincoln looked \u201ctoo Negroid\u201d and Washington \u201ctoo stern\u201d. A vain attempt was made to address the complaints but New York City aldermen ordered the murals destroyed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/26/san-francisco-george-washington-murals-new-york-harlem-courthouse\">Extra-mural studies: why students should not look away from uncomfortable art</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1938, two new scenes \u2013 Exploitation of Labor and The Hoarding of Wealth by David Karfunkle \u2013 were installed in place of the original murals.

The restaurant failed, and became a grocery store.</p> <p>Such is the fragility of black nobility in art.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Michael Henry Adams is an architectural-cultural historian and historic preservation activist who lives in, lectures on and conducts tours of Harlem.

  "<p>As the coronavirus crisis tests the resilience of democracies around the globe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/germany-low-coronavirus-mortality-rate-puzzles-experts\">Germany</a> has gone from cursing its lead-footed, decentralised political system to wondering if federalism\u2019s tortoise versus hare logic puts it in a better position to brave the pandemic than most.</p> <p>Under German federalism \u2013 which has roots going back to the Holy Roman Empire but was entrenched after the Nazi era to weaken centralised rule \u2013 key policy areas, such as health, education and cultural affairs, fall under the jurisdiction of the country\u2019s 16 states, or <em>L\u00e4nder.</em></p> <p>At the start of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/us-deaths-pass-3000-as-world-bank-warns-covid-19-will-drive-east-asia-into-poverty\">Covid-19 outbreak</a>, such a highly devolved system of governance made the woman nominally in charge of the country look oddly powerless: even when Angela Merkel announced the first raft of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/03/uk-coronavirus-live-emergency-nightingale-hospital-opens-today-matt-hancock-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e8761818f087564da1e5729\">social-distancing measures</a>, she could only make recommendations that the federal states were free to implement or ignore.</p> <p>As social-distancing measures came into effect, there were howls of frustration over how wildly the lockdowns varied between the states: in Berlin, for example, buying a book from a shop is still allowed but having a picnic in the park is not.
