  "<p>The White House appeared to be in fresh disarray on Wednesday as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> insisted that his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> taskforce would remain in place \u2013 less than 24 hours after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/trump-coronavirus-taskforce-pence-us-death-toll\">suggesting</a> it would be disbanded.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/06/us-coronavirus-live-trump-taskforce-fauci-reopening-latest-news-updates\">Coronavirus US live: Pelosi attacks Trump's focus on reopening and says 'death is not an economic motivator'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The US president reversed course following a backlash against moves to wind down the taskforce even as the country reports about 30,000 new coronavirus cases a day and the death toll moves past 70,000, the highest in the world.</p> <p>But Trump did confirm a switch in focus to reviving America\u2019s devastated economy, fuelling anxiety that he has made a cold <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/donald-trump-coronavirus-economic-recovery\">political calculation</a> to put his re-election chances ahead of saving lives.</p> <p>The 22-member White House coronavirus taskforce was created in late January, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence\">Mike Pence</a> was named as chairman. It met frequently to address the pandemic and then explained its work in nightly press briefings, but these came to be dominated by Trump often attacking the media, veering off topic or uttering disinformation, and sometimes lasted more than two hours.</p> <p>In a series of tweets on Wednesday, the president said that because of its success, \u201cthe Task Force will continue on indefinitely with its focus on SAFETY &amp; OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN. We may add or subtract people to it, as appropriate. The Task Force will also be very focused on Vaccines &amp; Therapeutics.\u201d</p> <p>The pledge sowed confusion after both Trump and Pence indicated on Tuesday that the taskforce, which has begun to meet less frequently and had not held a press briefing in more than a week, was to be dismantled.</p> <p>Trump had told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019re now looking at a little bit of a different form, and that form is safety and opening. And we\u2019ll have a different group probably set up for that.\u201d</p> <p>He later added, according to a pooled report: \u201cI thought we could wind it down sooner. But I had no idea how popular the taskforce is until actually yesterday when I started talking about winding down. It is appreciated by the public.\u201d</p> <p>And Pence had said: \u201cI think we\u2019re having conversations about that and about what the proper time is for the taskforce to complete its work and for the ongoing efforts to take place on an agency-by-agency level.\u201d</p> <p>The surprise remarks drew comparisons with the premature \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner that hung on an aircraft carrier where George W Bush addressed troops during the early stages of the Iraq war. It raised fears that Trump, with an eye on November\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">election</a>, had all but abandoned health needs in favour of economic imperatives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"879f6f80ea553435b6e202164e14ce1f04146e65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/879f6f80ea553435b6e202164e14ce1f04146e65/0_150_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump at the mask factory in Phoenix on Tuesday night.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump at the mask factory in Phoenix on Tuesday night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Touring a face mask factory in Arizona, where he defied guidelines by not wearing a mask himself and where the James Bond theme song Live and Let Die played over loudspeakers, the president admitted: \u201cI\u2019m not saying anything is perfect, and yes, will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.\u201d</p> <p>A strong <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">economy</a> has long been Trump\u2019s central argument for re-election, but stay-at-home orders during the pandemic have wreaked havoc and wiped out at least 30m jobs. Trump regards recovery as politically vital as a series of opinion polls show him trailing election opponent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a>.</p> <p>Undeterred by a coronavirus death toll already bigger than the US\u2019s in the Vietnam war, Trump has urged supporters to \u201cliberate\u201d states from pandemic restrictions and cheered on state governors who order reopenings in defiance of his own phased federal guidelines. Commentators suspect his strategy will be to claim credit for economic gains while shifting blame to governors for resurgences of the virus.</p> <p>Infection rates continue to increase outside New York, the hardest-hit state. On Monday, researchers at the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation almost doubled its previous US mortality model to more than 134,000. And a leaked internal White House report suggests that the daily US death toll will climb to 3,000 a day by June.</p> <p>The administration has also restricted coronavirus taskforce members from testifying before Congress unless they have \u201cexpress approval\u201d. The president said he stopped the infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci appearing before a House of Representatives committee because it is a \u201cset-up\u201d with a \u201cbunch of Trump-haters\u201d.</p> <p>But Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in the governance studies programme at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said any attempt to sideline Fauci and response coordinator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/dr-deborah-birx-coronavirus-taskforce-trump\">Deborah Birx</a> was doomed. \u201cHe might try to marginalise them but the press isn\u2019t going to try to marginalise them.</p> <p>\u201cThey are the people with the data and with the expertise and nobody with data and expertise is going to be marginalised. It\u2019s going to be the politicians who don\u2019t listen to the scientists who are going to get marginalised.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/06/donald-trump-lincoln-memorial-dishonest-don-monumental-backdrop-highlights-his-monumental-errors\">Dishonest Don's monumental backdrop highlights his monumental errors | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The White House suffered a further blow to its credibility this week when <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/us/jared-kushner-fema-coronavirus.html\">the New York Times reported</a> that Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, turned to young and unqualified volunteers from consulting and private equity firms to help secure masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment for hospitals.</p>",
  "<p>On a sun-speckled, tree-lined street on a sunny Sunday afternoon, Ahmaud Arbery ran through his neighborhood in the coastal town of Brunswick, Georgia. Neighbors had seen him run by their homes every day for years.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/georgia-brunswick-shooting-ahmaud-arbery-grand-jury\">Georgia to consider charges in killing of unarmed black jogger as video emerges</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>One of them was Lauren Bennett, 26, who says running was what Arbery was known for around their Fancy Bluff neighborhood in Brunswick. Her security camera would ping into her phone as he raced by each day.</p> \n<p>\u201cYup, there goes Ahmaud,\u201d she told the Guardian, recalling his bouts of exercise. She\u2019d heard he used to wave to another neighbor on his daily runs.</p> \n<p>It should just have been another ordinary run for the 25-year-old Arbery back in February. But a series of events unfolded that ended in his brutal killing at the hands of two white men, which has caused anger across America and especially among black Americans and campaigners for social justice.</p> \n<p>Now, as Bennett watches the video of how his last run through her neighborhood ended in his death, she cries.</p> \n<p>That sorrow \u2013 and rage \u2013 has spread through Georgia and the rest of the US, and has reignited a long-running debate over the killings of young black men by white people. It was sparked by a 36-second video released online months after that late February run \u2013 a video that shed new light on how Arbery was killed. In the film, an unidentified person in a car films Arbery jogging towards a white truck parked on the road, where two men stand: one in the bed of the truck and another just to its side.</p> \n<p>One shot rings out as Arbery disappears off camera, swerving around the truck. Another shot rings out as Arbery struggles back into frame as yet another shot is heard. Finally, he falls to the ground.</p> \n<p>Before police made it to Arbery, he was already dead.</p> \n<p>According to a police report, the two men, Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son, Travis McMichael, 34, had grabbed their weapons, a .357 Magnum revolver and a shotgun, jumped into a truck and began following Arbery after seeing him run by.</p> \n<p>In the video, it appears Arbery is running in the moments leading up to his death.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ff982312-edb3-412b-afb8-5d08db8a14a9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8EysSdqmQQI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The two men involved in the incident have not been charged or arrested over Arbery\u2019s death, but the case will now go to a grand jury following the release of the video and the condemnation that it produced, according to a statement from the district attorney in charge, Tom Durden.</p> \n<p>This month, the state chapter of the NAACP visited Arbery\u2019s family, calling for an end to race-based discrimination in Brunswick, a majority African American city. Tuesday evening, its local chapter<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bkzjWrLAV0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;fbclid=IwAR0__Izq6azDSEKizfDsFU2kQn2zwpGEi5g-Ret0Md1XRrAbj7_HR0UIdZc\"> called for swift action</a>, urging arrests to be made in the case and the immediate dismissal of the Glynn county police chief.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is murder,\u201d wrote Lee Merritt, a civil rights attorney who is representing Arbery\u2019s mother, in a statement posted to Facebook.</p> \n<p>Arbery\u2019s mother has been unable to watch the video that now has over 4 million views and has drawn condemnation from prominent figures across the country, including the former vice-president and 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden.</p> \n<p>The McMichaels, according to numerous reports, argue they were abiding by Georgia\u2019s stand-your-ground statute, a similar defense to that used by security guard George Zimmerman in the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida.</p> \n<p>Arbery\u2019s death is one of dozens of killings of black boys and men across America, who have been shot in their communities often while engaging in everyday activities. Tamir Rice was killed at a playground in Ohio; Terence Crutcher slain while being pulled over by police; and Walter Scott shot dead in South Carolina after a traffic stop.</p> \n<p>L Chris Stewart, an Atlanta-based civil rights attorney who has represented a number of families like Arbery\u2019s, has a close relationship with the lawyer representing Arbery\u2019s mother. The two have spoken about what happened to Arbery. When Stewart first heard what happened, he thought to himself, \u201cI jog and I live in a predominantly white neighborhood now. And, you know, if someone suspects you\u2019re a criminal because you\u2019re black, then this is going to turn into the Wild Wild West.\u201d</p> \n<p>Glynn county, where Brunswick sits, has a history of controversy in its police departments. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.wtoc.com/2020/02/28/glynn-county-vidalia-police-chiefs-indicted/\">a former county police officer was indicted</a>. Initially, the prosecutors involved with the case chose not to press charges against the elder McMichael and his son. Documents and state records show the older McMichael is a <a href=\"https://law.georgia.gov/press-releases/2009-02-25/execution-date-set-man-convicted-glynn-county-murder\">former police detective</a> and <a href=\"https://thebrunswicknews.com/news/local_news/judge-signs-order-of-execution/article_5197ce3d-f667-5533-af39-665c715b6b98.html\">district attorney investigator</a> in Glynn county.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really corrupt police department,\u201d Stewart said.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday night, more than two months after Arbery was shot in the middle of the street, the Georgia bureau of investigations announced the Glynn county police had not asked them to investigate the shooting, but rather, looked into threats against those involved in the investigation.</p> \n<p>The state\u2019s governor and attorney general spoke out after the video was released on Tuesday. \u201cI expect justice to be carried out as swiftly as possible,\u201d the attorney general, Chris Carr, said in a statement.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday evening, Bennett saw dozens of people coming to and from a protest in front of the McMichaels\u2019 home. On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.wsbtv.com/news/georgia/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-gbi-joins-investigation-video-surfaces-social-media/CCIAX3SWRVEDRI63SA5RDBZHVE/\">protest</a><a href=\"https://www.wsbtv.com/news/georgia/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-gbi-joins-investigation-video-surfaces-social-media/CCIAX3SWRVEDRI63SA5RDBZHVE/\">ers gathered</a> in Atlanta at the state capitol.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on through the McMichaels\u2019 heads, and if they think the black community is shaken. But all races are hurt. We\u2019re all upset,\u201d Bennett said.</p> \n<p>But she was not surprised this happened in Brunswick \u2013 or anywhere in America.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s just racism, honestly. To me, it\u2019s never gonna die.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Guardian has published an edited version of the video after Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Arbery\u2019s father, said the family consented to its public dissemination.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 May 2020. Walter Scott was shot dead in South Carolina after a traffic stop, not shot dead in Louisiana leaving a convenience store as an earlier version said. An erroneous suggestion that four shots, rather than three, had been fired at Ahmaud Arbery was also corrected.</p>",

Retailers should use contactless payment and limit the number of customers allowed into their shop at the same time.</p> <p>For workers such as taxi drivers, it might be physically impossible to keep a 1.5m distance between themselves and the customer. One suggestion on the Safe Work website is for taxi and ride-share drivers to install a perspex screen between the front and back seats.</p> <h2><strong>The end of all-staff meetings and communal lunches</strong></h2> <p>All non-essential gatherings, meetings and training should be postponed, cancelled or conducted via tele or video conferencing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/05/australian-restaurants-and-cafes-present-plans-to-come-out-of-coronavirus-shutdown\">Australian restaurants and cafes present plans to come out of coronavirus shutdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In fact, workplaces should also try to stagger meal breaks and start times to reduce the number of workers using common spaces at the same time.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendon Murphy, said on Tuesday that staggering start and finish times could also help ease public transport congestion.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want everybody crowding on public transport at the same time, we don\u2019t want everyone crowding in the lifts at the beginning of the day and the end of the day,\u201d he said.</p> <h2><strong>Cleaning, cleaning, cleaning</strong></h2> <p>Workplaces will have to be cleaned at least daily using detergent, and disinfected as needed depending on how high-traffic the area is.</p> <p>In retail stores, that means regularly cleaning counters, phones, Eftpos machines and even clothes racks.</p> <p>It may be difficult to disinfect high-contact areas multiple times in a shift; in those cases a workplace may need to limit the number of people coming into contact with that area.</p> <p>For taxi drivers, this may mean telling passengers not to open the doors from the outside themselves to avoid disinfecting the handle after each ride. For those in an office space, it may mean the end of hot-desking.</p> <h2><strong>On-site temperature checks</strong></h2> <p>SafeWork acknowledges that there may be times where it is reasonable for employers to administrator temperature checks to staff when they reopen. These include situations where staff live together in accommodation, such as agricultural workers, or in workplaces where vulnerable people are, like aged care facilities.</p> <p>But on the whole, a temperature check isn\u2019t going to definitively prove someone has Covid-19, and SafeWork says \u201cthere may be little benefit\u201d. </p> <h2><strong>What do the experts say about a return to work?</strong></h2> <p>In terms of whether this is the right time for businesses to open up again, leading epidemiologist Prof Tony Blakely says \u201cthere is absolutely no question\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEverything comes down to whether the goal [in Australia] is elimination or suppression [of the virus],\u201d Blakely says. \u201cAssuming we are going for suppression, then absolutely we should try and open things back up, but it should be done in tranches.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to accept there will be some low amount of community transmission, but we need to stamp those cases out as quickly as we can.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/coronavirus-and-airborne-transmission-scientists-warn-australia-to-be-on-guard\">Coronavirus and airborne transmission: scientists warn Australia to be on guard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Dr Libby Sander, assistant professor of organisational behaviour at Bond University, says Safe Work\u2019s guidelines pose challenges that may deter some businesses from inviting staff back into the office.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a lot of discussion about bringing teams into offices on certain days,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if there was hot-desking in place, which is the case for a lot of high corporates in Australia, there would have to be a deep cleaning done at the end of the day before the next shift comes in.

  "<p>A prosecutor in Georgia said he would ask a grand jury to decide if charges should be filed against a white former law enforcement officer and his son over the fatal shooting of an unarmed young black man as he ran through a small town.</p> \n<p>The shooting of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery outside Brunswick, Georgia, in February was captured on videotape and posted on social media on Tuesday, stirring outrage over the reluctance of prosecutors to file charges against Gregory McMichael and his son, Travis. </p> \n<p>The video footage, which was taken by an unidentified witness in another car, shows Arbery jogging down a narrow two-lane road and around a white pickup truck stopped in the right lane, its driver\u2019s door open.</p> \n<p>As Arbery crosses back in front of the truck a gunshot is fired. Arbery is then seen struggling with a man holding a long gun as a second man stands in the bed of the truck brandishing a revolver. Two more shots are heard before Arbery stumbles and falls face-down on to the asphalt.</p> \n<p>The graphic footage has prompted an outcry and demands for justice; the activist Shaun King posted the video on Twitter, describing it as \u201cone of the worst things I\u2019ve seen in my entire life\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ff982312-edb3-412b-afb8-5d08db8a14a9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8EysSdqmQQI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p> Tom Durden, the acting district attorney for a neighboring district, said in a letter posted on Facebook that he believed \u201cthe case should be presented to the grand jury of Glynn county for consideration of criminal charges against those involved in the death of Mr Arbery\u201d.</p> \n<p>Durden, who was assigned to investigate the fatal shooting after prosecutors in Brunswick and a neighboring district recused themselves due to potential conflicts of interest, said he would present the case to the next available grand jury in Glynn county. That grand jury might not meet until mid-June or later because courts were under restrictions imposed by the coronavirus pandemic, he said.</p> \n<p>According to a police report obtained by the New York Times, Gregory McMichael, a former police officer and district attorney\u2019s investigator, told investigators the incident began when he spotted Arbery from his front yard \u201chauling ass\u201d down the street.</p> \n<p>McMichael told police that, because he suspected Arbery in a string of recent neighborhood break-ins, he summoned his son and the two men gave chase in the truck, Gregory McMichael carrying a .357 Magnum revolver and Travis armed with a shotgun.</p> \n<p>Gregory McMichael said Arbery began to \u201cviolently attack\u201d his son and fought over the shotgun, prompting Travis to open fire. It is not clear from the police report or the videotape if Gregory McMichael also fired on Arbery.</p> \n<p>But it appears from the video footage that by the time the clearly unarmed Arbery is tussling with Travis McMichael, who is holding the long gun, a shot has already been fired.</p> \n<p>The Democratic presidential candidate and presumptive nominee Joe Biden tweeted that it was clear Arbery was killed \u201cin cold blood\u201d and called for a full murder investigation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1257876833581912065\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The video is clear: Ahmaud Arbery was killed in cold blood.

  "<p>Astronomers say they have discovered a black hole on our doorstep, just 1,000 light years from Earth.</p> <p>It was found in a system called HR 6819, in the constellation Telescopium.</p> <p>The system appears through a telescope as a single bright star, but telltale signs in the light emitted have previously revealed there to be two stars present.</p> <p>Now experts say they have further analysed the data to discover there is another body within the system: a black hole with a mass over four times that of our sun, and the closest to Earth found so far.</p> <p>\u201cWe realised that one could not describe what we saw with just two stars,\u201d said Dietrich Baade, an emeritus astronomer at European Southern Observatory (ESO) and a co-author of the study.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the stars is moving periodically, with a period of 40 days,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the only way to understand that period and the very large [velocity] of 60km per second with a mass five times that of the sun was to infer that there is another very massive body which, however, is not visible.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, a black hole \u2013 an object typically formed from the gravitational collapse of a massive star.</p> <p>The upshot, said Baade, is a so-called \u201chierarchical triple system\u201d, which he explained by reference to a child\u2019s mobile.</p> <p>\u201cOn the one branch of the mobile you have two stars hanging, one of which is not visible, which is black \u2013 that is the black hole. And these two objects are orbiting each other,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the other branch of the mobile you have one star which is much farther away from the other two.\u201d</p> <p>The black hole is unusual. \u201cThe hallmark of this black hole is that it is truly black,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost all the other black holes that we know are in the Milky Way \u2013 and there are only two dozen of them \u2013 shine very brightly in X-rays.\u201d</p> <p>Baade said the other black holes each had a companion star that feeds them with gas. However, this does not appear to be the case for the newly discovered black hole and its nearby star.</p> <p>\u201cThis star is not so massive that it loses a lot of gas and therefore the black hole is starving and that makes it so dark.\u201d</p> <p>He said only a handful of similar black holes had been found previously, and they merited further scrutiny. \u201cIt may also be the first ever [black hole of this kind],\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/06/supersized-black-hole-discovery-forces-universal-rethink\">Supersized black hole discovery forces universal rethink</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Baade added that HR 6819 \u2013 or rather, its stars \u2013 can be seen by the naked eye. \u201cIf you want to see it really overhead, you need to be at the southern tip of South America,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The new work, which is <a href=\"https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2020/05/aa38020-20/aa38020-20.html\">published in the journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</a>, is based on data collected using telescopes at ESO\u2019s La Silla Observatory in Chile.</p> <p>\u201cTheoretical models suggest that in the Milky Way there are between 100m and 1bn black holes,\u201d said Baade. \u201cWe are finding a tip of an iceberg.\u201d</p> <p>The discovery could shed light on an unusual system in the constellation Gemini called LB-1. This system has previously been suggested to be composed of a star and a tremendously massive black hole \u2013 a finding that has foxed experts. Baade noted LB-1 appears to be very similar to HR 6819.</p> <p>He said that suggests LB-1 could be a triple system, meaning its \u201cdark object\u201d would be a black hole of a more normal mass, or possibly a neutron star.</p> <p>Dr Ziri Younsi, an expert on black holes at University College London, who was not involved with the research, said: \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that a black hole has been found so close to Earth,\u201d noting for context that the centre of our galaxy is about 25,000 light years from Earth.</p> <p>\u201cThis new study hints at the exciting prospect of a whole population of stellar-mass black holes lurking in our Galaxy,\u201d Younsi said. \u201cIt also offers a potential new means to detect many more systems comprising such quiescent black holes in our galactic neighbourhood in the near future.\u201d</p>",

Is this discrimination? | Gene Marks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cA lot of the money that was set aside for small businesses did not end up in the businesses that we own and operate,\u201d said Ron Busby, president of US Black Chambers, a not-for-profit advocacy group for black business owners. \u201cWhen this piece of legislation came out and it did not address an equitable way for black and brown business owners to get access to capital, it is a huge burden for us.\u201d</p> <p>As black Americans face disproportionately harsh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/african-americans-unemployment-covid-19-economic-impact\">economic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-racial-disparities-african-americans\">health</a> consequences due to the Covid-19 crisis, advocates say black business owners have been having difficulty getting access to the funds because many black-owned businesses do not have relationships with established banks. As business owners rushed to apply for loans, which were given on a first-come, first-serve basis, some banks said they were <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/7/21209584/paycheck-protection-program-banks-access\">giving priority</a> to existing clients.</p> <p>Black business owners can face discriminatory hurdles when approaching traditional banks for a business loan that prevents them from building credit and building a relationship with a bank.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.usu.edu/today/story/usu-research-shows-discrimination-in-small-business-lending-practices\">Research</a> has shown that even with the same credit history, black business owners seeking small business loans receive less friendly treatment and information about a bank\u2019s services compared with their white counterparts. In 2017, a Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/2017/pr-20171108-atlanta-and-cleveland-feds.aspx\">study</a> found that, though black business owners apply for small business loans at a higher rate than white business owners, the approval rate for white entrepreneurs is 19% higher than the approval rate for black entrepreneurs.</p> <p>For black business owners, not getting the loans they need can start a vicious cycle where they continuously struggle to pay any credit they take out. \u201cYou end up either suffering through the process trying to figure out how to pay, [or] you\u2019re not able to pay in full, which means your credit is damaged because you\u2019re not paying on time,\u201d Busby said. \u201cWe never get out of that hole.\u201d</p> <p>Many minority business owners have much stronger relationships with community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions that are smaller, but friendlier toward those who are often turned away by traditional banks. These types of banks experienced more technical difficulties in setting up loan applications for the paycheck protection program. As a result, Congress <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11355\">allocated</a> $30bn out of the second wave of funding to be set aside specifically for these community financial institutions.</p> <p>Kita Holmes, the owner of 5 Star Property Management, said that she has had difficulty getting a loan for her Maryland-based property management company that has seen a decline in new renters and property investors since the crisis started.</p> <p>Though she applied for a loan during the program\u2019s first round of funding through her bank, she never received a response to her application. The only line of credit she had was closed, and she is worried about the future of her business.</p> <p>\u201cI have saved, but if this market doesn\u2019t open up and things don\u2019t change pretty quickly \u2026 I don\u2019t know what will happen. I will probably look for work,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give up, but it\u2019s very hard times for a small black business owner.\u201d</p> <p>Because the payroll protection program stipulates that a bulk of the loan must be used for payroll expenses in order to be forgiven, many black business owners could be excluded from forgiveness since a majority do not have employees on payroll.</p> <p>Only about 120,000 black-owned businesses, out of the 2.7m in the US, have employees on payroll, Busby said. Because the average annual revenue of a black-owned business is $75,000, \u201cit\u2019s hard to have anyone else work for you when you\u2019re only bringing in enough revenue to pay expenses and keep yourself employed\u201d, he added.</p>",
