Iata\u2019s director general, Alexandre de Juniac, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The industry\u2019s outlook grows darker by the day.

Allowing them an exemption would weaken any debt-relief initiative. Providing aid through the World Bank and other donors while allowing commercial debt payments to absorb a large share of the transfer would be the financial equivalent of pouring water into a bucket with large holes. To put the figures in context, commercial debt repayments would be equivalent to over half of the emergency Covid-19 financing being prepared by the World Bank for delivery through IDA.</p> \n   <p>... Official creditors should make it clear that they expect commercial creditors to apply comparable treatment. There are precedents which, if not directly applicable, could serve as a guide. These include the \u2018Vienna Initiative\u2019 through which European governments coordinated the response to the 2009 financial crisis. If necessary, governments should encourage participation by making access to special Covid-19 financing programmes conditional on commercial creditors participating in the debt standstill. Faced with a global public health emergency that demands a global financial response, governments must deploy their regulatory powers and financial resources in the interest. The G20 should work with the IMF and World Bank to convene a commercial creditors summit to agree terms for creditor participation in debt repayment suspension.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/commercial-creditors-must-sign-up-to-global-debt-deal-or-forgo-covid-19-help\">Commercial creditors 'must sign up to global debt deal' - or forgo Covid-19 help</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T16:57:16.441Z\">at 5.57pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e95e3c18f082a2cd32a6aa3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T16:38:41.425Z\">5.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The coronavirus lockdown in <strong>Uganda</strong> has been extended for another three weeks, with the president, Yoweri Museveni, calling on people to be disciplined to avoid spreading infection. </p> \n  <p>In a lengthy address to the nation on Tuesday, Museveni reaffirmed Uganda\u2019s 35 restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus, adding that judging by the comparatively low number of infections in the country - 54 confirmed cases as of Monday - they seemed to have worked.

The strictest measures implemented so far have been gatherings of more than 50 people and a ban on visits to nursing homes.</p> \n  <p>But its soft approach has drawn criticism. On Tuesday Sweden\u2019s public health agency said it had recorded a total of 11,445 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 1,033 deaths. Neighbouring Finland, which has about half the population of Sweden, had as of Tuesday reported 64 deaths, and has closed down restaurants and schools.</p> \n  <p>In an open letter, a group of 22 doctors, virologists and researchers from Sweden\u2019s top hospitals, universities and research institutes pointed write:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One would like to imagine that Sweden has also had a forward-looking strategy, especially as our country has always had a different way of dealing with the spread of infection than the rest of the world. One would like to imagine that our authorities have prepared well since the epidemic broke out in China, and especially since it was clear that the problem was likely to be global.</p> \n   <p>\u2026 If there was a well-thought-out, well-functioning strategy for Swedish infection prevention work with Covid-19, Sweden would hardly have the same death toll as Italy today, and 10 times higher than Finland\u2019s. If there had been a well-developed, well-functioning strategy, half of Stockholm\u2019s elderly residents would not have been affected by the epidemic - and in some cases over 20% of the healthcare staff would be antibody positive.</p> \n   <p>\u2026 The approach must be changed radically and quickly. As the disease-free virus spreads, it is necessary to increase social distance. Close schools and restaurants in the same way you do in Finland. Everyone who works with the elderly must wear adequate protective equipment. Prior to mass testing of infectiousness on all caring staff and testing for antibodies to sars-covid-2 so that established immune personnel can return to work.

He appealed to Germans to continue following the hygiene regulations as well as keeping their distance, saying these remained the two most crucial ways to dampen the virus\u2019 spread.</p> \n  <p>He added that in Germany the average age of those infected was 49, and a cough, temperature, blocked nose and loss of taste and smell remained the most commonly reported symptoms. In 2% of cases people developed pneumonia he said, while 16% of cases ended up in hospital.</p> \n  <p>On Monday, the Academy of Sciences, Leopoldina released a long-awaited study in which it recommended a staggered return to normal life starting with schools reopening.

system</h2> \n  <p>In the third week of March, while most of our minds were fixed on surging coronavirus death rates and the apocalyptic scenes in hospital wards, global financial markets came as close to a collapse as they have since September 2008. The price of shares in the world\u2019s major corporations plunged. The value of the dollar surged against every currency in the world, squeezing debtors everywhere from Indonesia to Mexico. Trillion-dollar markets for government debt, the basic foundation of the financial system, lurched up and down in terror-stricken cycles.</p> \n  <p>On the terminal screens, interest rates danced. Traders hunched over improvised home workstations \u2013 known in the new slang of March 2020 as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/global-traders-creating-the-ultimate-work-from-home-rona-rigs\">Rona rigs</a>\u201d \u2013 screaming with frustration as sluggish home wifi systems dragged behind the movement of the markets. At the low point on 23 March, $26tn had been <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2020/03/22/goodbye-dow-30000-hello-dow-10000/#559a9620ff50\">wiped off</a> the value of global equity markets, inflicting huge losses both on the fortunate few who own shares, and on the collective pools of savings held by pension and insurance funds.</p> \n  <p>What the markets were reacting to was an unthinkable turn of events. After a fatal period of hesitation, governments around the world were ordering comprehensive lockdowns to contain a lethal pandemic. Built for growth, the global economic machine was being brought to a screeching halt. In 2020, for the first time since the second world war, production around the world will contract. </p> \n  <p>It is now clear that we can, if circumstances demand, turn the economy off. But the consequences are catastrophic. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/how-coronavirus-almost-brought-down-the-global-financial-system\">How coronavirus almost brought down the global financial system</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e95475c8f08db3109f21f15\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helen-davidson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T05:18:50.139Z\">6.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Global Covid-19 cases near 2 million as Putin warns Russia faces \u2018extraordinary\u2019 crisis</h2> \n  <p>The number of Covid-19 cases recorded worldwide is nearing 2 million, as Vladimir Putin warned warned officials to brace for \u201ccomplex and extraordinary\u201d scenarios in Russia as a result of the outbreak.</p> \n  <p>The country reported 2,558 new cases on Monday, its highest daily figure yet, as officials tightened lockdown restrictions in Moscow.

The OBR said: \u201cThe longer the period of economic disruption lasts, the more likely it is that the economy\u2019s future potential output will be scarred.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a grim assessment that depends heavily on how long ministers decide to keep the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/raab-suggests-uk-lockdown-could-last-at-least-another-month\">lockdown measures</a> in place, the OBR scenario assumed that tight controls would be maintained for three months, followed by a further three months when they are only partially lifted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today&nbsp;email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The watchdog said it was not attempting to predict what ministers would ultimately decide.

Despite a decade of deep cuts to public services, the deficit remained at almost \u00a350bn in the last financial year.</p> \n<p>Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said a complete reappraisal of economic policy would be required once the dust settled on the coronavirus crisis but predicted that a return to austerity was unlikely. \u201cTough decisions will have to be made which are likely to involve tax rises and higher debt for some time to come,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Warning that the prospect for jobs and growth could significantly worsen if lockdown measures are extended well into the summer, Johnson added: \u201cWe must not underestimate just how staggering these figures are, and by how much the economic outlook has shifted compared to just a few months ago.\u201d</p> \n<p>Underlining the tough choices facing ministers over how best to end the steps to curtail social and business activity, the OBR warned that each additional month of tight control would cost the exchequer as much as \u00a345bn of additional borrowing.</p> \n<p>As the economy crashes and public borrowing balloons, Britain\u2019s national debt \u2013 the sum of every annual budget deficit \u2013 is expected to spiral to more than 100% of GDP this year.</p> \n<p>Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, said it was clear the coronavirus pandemic would have<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/rishi-sunak-deeply-troubled-by-obr-warning-of-35-fall-in-uk-gdp\"> a very significant impact on the UK economy</a>, just as it would for other nations around the world.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople should know that there is hardship ahead and we won\u2019t be able to protect every job or every business,\u201d he said at the government\u2019s daily press briefing.</p> \n<p>Saying that the OBR forecasts were only a potential scenario, he said the report had confirmed government actions had protected jobs. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t done these things it would mean that things were a lot worse.\u201d</p> \n<p>Against a background of mounting concerns over the government\u2019s exit strategy, some observers warned against over-simplifying the argument between balancing economic prosperity with the health of the country.</p> \n<p>The Resolution Foundation warned that ending the lockdown now could lead to more deaths in future, as well as the need for a reimposition of tougher lockdown measures that could cause greater economic damage.</p> \n<p>Torsten Bell, the thinktank\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThis should caution against those arguing that policymakers can avoid these costs by simply ending the current lockdown.</p> \n<p>\u201cPolicymakers should also recognise that these forecasts represent just one scenario for a three-month lockdown. History shows that measures to control a pandemic can in fact last much longer.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>From Skype interviews to online game-based assessments, the way that companies recruit is changing fast. School-leavers and graduates need to keep up \u2013 but it can be difficult to know just what\u2019s required of you when you start applying for your first job. That\u2019s where PwC\u2019s new <a href=\"https://www.pwc.co.uk/careers/student-jobs/employability.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Employability Hub</a> comes in. It\u2019s an online, accessible to all, one-stop shop for employability skills and careers advice, designed to give those in the early stages of their career the skills they need to tackle every stage of the application process.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to make employability upskilling available to all,\u201d says Louise Farrar, PwC\u2019s director of student recruitment. \u201cThe hub is designed to educate not just those applying for jobs but also their parents and school career advisers. It shows you what this new world looks like, how you can prepare for it, and the tools you need to navigate it. Employers are moving away from traditional techniques like face-to-face interviews. They\u2019re using new technologies that do the job much better.\u201d</p> <p>If you\u2019re just starting out, you won\u2019t necessarily have the technical skills to do a job, says Farrar: it\u2019s all about showing employers that you have potential. \u201cEmployers will want to see that you can demonstrate the right behaviours and soft skills, such as effective communication, teamwork and managing relationships. Any work experience is good experience \u2013 I was a waitress and a packer. That taught me a lot about the world of work, and what I did and didn\u2019t want to do for the rest of my life.\u201d</p> <p>Knowing how to tell your personal, authentic story is crucial, says Farrar: you might not have a string of glowing extracurricular achievements, but you may have experienced adversity, or particular challenges. \u201cThat might have made you resilient and given you good ways to cope in particularly difficult situations. And they\u2019re also looking for people who are inclusive, who are passionate about what they do, and have fun doing it.\u201d</p> <p>The hub uses a range of digital learning tools to give users that insight, enabling them to prepare and provide examples of where they\u2019ve succeeded or shown particular skills. There are podcasts on technology trends, plus e-learning tutorials on creating a good application, how to succeed at video interviews, and preparing for online assessment tests. And you\u2019ll also find guides to soft skills such as engaging with employers and communicating effectively.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8757bc3ac5aee8d9632cc44dd582769a68aa24f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8757bc3ac5aee8d9632cc44dd582769a68aa24f7/55_0_1437_1437/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Helen Hopkin, PwC\u2019s head of workforce strategy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helen Hopkin, PwC\u2019s head of workforce strategy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PwC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The career matching tool aims to help users find the best possible opportunity, whatever career you want to pursue. The hub is for everyone, not just those wanting a career with PwC, Farrar emphasises, and choosing a career is about more than just the paycheck. \u201cIt gets you thinking about what your work preferences are and what kind of person you are,\u201d she says. \u201cFor example, do you want to do a professional qualification? Do you want to travel a lot? Are you keen to be in a big office? All those sorts of things help you think about what you might want to focus on when it comes to career opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>And some of those tools \u2013 such as the video interview \u2013 are the ones actually used in PwC assessments, helping to demystify the process and make it more accessible. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking to trip anyone up!\u201d says Farrar. \u201cRather, we want to equip people to be the best they can possibly be and feel confident in that interview situation. Doing a video interview can be quite a daunting process, particularly if it\u2019s your first time. So you\u2019ll find lots of helpful hints and tips, opportunities to play back your answers and get some general feedback.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s hoped that projects like the hub will reach as wide an audience as possible: it\u2019s tailormade for a generation of digital natives. And while its primary purpose is to help prospective candidates prepare, finding the best person for the job is a two-way process. Employers also need to understand what candidates want from a workplace, and what skills they need to focus on. PwC now has a strategic workforce planning capability to enable the firm to do regular scenario planning. \u201cThis provides sophisticated insights into the types of skills in demand over the short and medium term, and allows us to take some educated leaps of faith as to what skills are needed in the future,\u201d says Helen Hopkin, PwC\u2019s head of workforce strategy.</p> <p>\u201cThe world\u2019s demographics continue to shift \u2013 millennials will make up 75% of the global workforce by 2025. We have already seen a shift in how we do things to appeal to those who want something different from the workplace. We need to make sure this continues to evolve as we work together to understand what that needs to look like. We can never stand still; this is a process of constant learning, changing and adapting,\u201d she adds.</p>",
  "<p>Tasha Colbert of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, thinks of her 83-year-old grandmother Loraine as a pillar of the family. \u201cMy grandmother is like my mother; she raised me.\u201d But for the past two weeks, the matriarch has been battling Covid-19 in the intensive care unit at Community Memorial hospital.</p> <p>Loraine\u2019s fight with Covid-19 started with a slight fever. But after her condition worsened, Colbert said her grandmother, who already has chronic lung disease, has been on a breathing machine, and family members are not allowed to see her in person. \u201cTo me the isolation is what can kill more than anything,\u201d Colbert said.</p> <p>Colbert\u2019s grandmother lives on the north side of Milwaukee, a predominantly African American part of a city whose black residents are carrying much of the load of the novel coronavirus, and suffer worse outcomes.

And 44 of the 67 people who have died in the county were black. Most live on the city\u2019s north side.</p> <p>The way the pandemic has hit the black community here has some people asking <em>why</em> this is happening. But local health experts and community activists are not surprised, given the health and economic disparities black people in Wisconsin face.</p> <p>Wisconsin has the highest <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/files/uploads/Race-in-the-Midwest-FINAL-Interactive-1.pdf\">black-white unemployment</a> gap in the US. <a href=\"https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/minority-health/population/afriamer-pophealth.htm\">Black men and women</a> have higher rates of heart disease mortality, and nearly 34% of black people in Milwaukee live below the <a href=\"https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=poverty%20rate%20in%20Milwaukee%20city&amp;g=1600000US5553000&amp;hidePreview=false&amp;tid=ACSST1Y2018.S1701&amp;t=Poverty&amp;layer=VT_2018_160_00_PY_D1&amp;cid=S1701_C01_001E&amp;vintage=2018\">poverty</a> line.
