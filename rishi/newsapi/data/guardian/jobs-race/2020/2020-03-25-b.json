  "<p>More than a million Californians have filed for unemployment this month due to the coronavirus crisis, the state\u2019s governor announced.</p> <p>\u201cWe just passed the 1 million mark for the number of claims since March 13,\u201d the Gavin Newsom said at a press conference on Wednesday about the unemployment claims.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/california-coronavirus-cases-hospital-beds-new-york\">California scrambles to avoid Covid-19's worst-case scenario: 'It will take a heroic effort'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The jump in new unemployment claims is unprecedented. On a typical day, the California department of unemployment sees 2,000 new claims. Last week, on Wednesday, 80,000 new claims were filed in a single day.</p> <p>Unemployment departments, which are run by each state, are being overwhelmed with a surge in new claims since the nation\u2019s businesses began closing their doors, sending home or laying off legions of workers across industries.</p> <p>At a Tuesday press conference, Newsom urged patience as unemployed workers filed claims. California\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/20/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus-how-to-file-what-to-expect\">unemployment department says</a> people can typically receive unemployment benefits \u2013 a portion of typical income \u2013 within a couple of weeks.</p> <p>But information about why someone left work, and whether it was due to the coronavirus, must be verified with employers and doctors. With businesses shut, and doctors overwhelmed, that process could be delayed significantly.</p> <p>A $2tn US stimulus package headed toward the finish line could provide additional assistance, adding $600 a week to benefits across the board. And it would cover workers considered independent contract workers, like ride-share drivers, who aren\u2019t covered by traditional unemployment.</p> <p>Newsom last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-california-more-than-half-gavin-newsom\">announced an order</a> that asks California residents to stay home unless absolutely necessary, amid growing rates of corona infections. The order says broadly that people should remain at home unless it is absolutely necessary to venture out for supplies or food.</p> <p>Essential businesses, including grocery stores and big-box stores like Target, have been allowed to operate, while all businesses considered non-essential were required to close. The rules have been confusing for workers in some industries; while construction workers are allowed to carry on with residential projects, those working on commercial projects are off the clock.</p> <p>Last week, Newsom signed an executive order that asked cities and counties to enact eviction bans to keep people from getting displaced. But with the order set to expire in April, housing advocates have been left to wonder how rent will be paid after that. Newsom said he and a team were reviewing the legality of potential solutions.</p> <p>Newsom said on Tuesday he had spoken with CEOs from 200 financial institutions who committed to a 90-day waiver on mortgages and foreclosures. The governor said Bank of America was the only large financial institution that didn\u2019t agree to a 90-day waiver. A spokesman said Bank of America will instead offer relief on a case-by-case basis until the crisis is over and has also agreed to pause foreclosures, evictions and repossessions.</p> <p>There have been nearly 3,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in California, and more than 60 people have died. The governor also said an investigation was under way to determine the cause of death of a young person in Los Angeles, who is believed to be the first minor killed by the coronavirus. Newsom urged caution about hastening to make assumptions about the case.</p> <p>The death \u201cunderscores the enormity of the challenge in front of us and how it can impact anybody\u201d, Newsom said. Half of all positive cases in California fell in the 18-to-49 age range, Newsom said in a news conference on Tuesday evening. \u201cYoung people can and will be impacted by this virus.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday, Newsom added that 37 confirmed coronavirus cases were in children under the age of 18.</p> <p>With an eye to New York, the nation\u2019s new coronavirus center and home to about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/25/new-york-andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-cases\">60%</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/25/new-york-andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-cases\"> of the US cases</a>, California leaders are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/california-coronavirus-cases-hospital-beds-new-york\">scrambling to prepare</a> for a sudden surge on hospitals that could overwhelm healthcare workers and available bed space.</p> <p>The state needed 50,000 hospital beds to prepare for a coming demand, Newsom said on Tuesday, a projection he has adjusted upwards over the past week. Two additional hospitals, eight field hospitals and a navy hospital ship to be docked in Los Angeles will add to the state\u2019s options.</p> <p>Newsom said the state had tested 66,800 people, a huge jump from previous days. The governor attributed the huge jump to tests conducted by private labs including Quest Diagnostics whose tests had not previously been reflected in the total. Kaiser Permanente alone is now performing 12,000 tests a day, but there are still delays in getting the results back.</p> <p>Newsom implored state residents to keep a safe distance from those who do not live in the same house and to adhere, completely, to the stay-at-home orders to prevent further spread of the virus.</p> <p>\u201cHalfway is no way,\u201d said Newsom.</p>",

The first official government snapshot of how coronavirus has hit the labor market is due on Thursday, when the labor department releases unemployment figures for last week.</p> <p>The last department of labor figures showed initial unemployment claims rose to 281,000, a sharp rise from 211,000 the previous week but nothing to what is expected tomorrow.</p> <p>The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) thinktank estimated a record-setting 3.4 million people filed unemployment claims last week based on <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/coronavirus-record-breaking-spike-in-ui-claims/\">an analysis of news reports</a>. Weekly claims have not topped a million since records began in 1967.</p> <p>Such an increase would set the nationwide unemployment figures to 2015 levels in just one week. \u201cThis is overwhelming even our quite strong labor market,\u201d said Heidi Shierholz, EPI\u2019s director of policy.</p> <p>The surge is also overwhelming unemployment offices. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/new-york-unemployment-benefits-system-creaks\">In New York</a>, there were about 159,000 more calls to the labor department in one day than the normal 10,000 daily calls the office gets. <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/California-unemployment-coronavirus-numbers-news-15152303.php\">In California</a>, the daily average of unemployment claims has increased by more than 4,000%.</p> <p>Major employers including Marriott and Macy\u2019s have sent staff home. General Electric and airlines including Delta and American are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/23/existential-crisis-airline-workers-fear-layoffs-amid-coronavirus-pandemic\">laying off staff</a> as their industries suffer.</p> <p>Shierholz said despite the gloom, the federal government has the power and resources to intervene. \u201cThe economy is taking a big hit, but it is a policy choice, the level of human suffering that is caused,\u201d Shierholz said.</p> <p>EPI is one of several bodies advocating for the federal government to waive unemployment insurance requirements, such as making people demonstrate they are looking for work; increase funding to social support systems, such as food stamps; place moratoriums on evictions; and allow laid off or furloughed people to continue using their employer-sponsored healthcare so state health insurance programs aren\u2019t overwhelmed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The US is experiencing a record-breaking spike in unemployment\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://www.epi.org?p=188777&view=embed&embed_template=charts_v2013_08_21&embed_date=20200324&onp=188903&utm_source=epi_press&utm_medium=chart_embed&utm_campaign=charts_v2\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Worker advocates are also encouraging employers to simply keep paying their employees, because when the crisis is over, those jobs will need to be filled again.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s much more friction to get the economy up and running again, but if you have everybody just hooked to jobs, we can basically just turn the lights back on,\u201d Shierholz said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most efficient, good thing to do right now.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"expected%20to%20be%20the%20largest%20US%20economic%20stimulus%20measure%20ever%20passed.\">Early Wednesday</a>, Congress reached a deal on what is expected to be the largest US economic stimulus measure ever passed.Democrats and Republicans had been divided on the level of oversight required for industries receiving bailouts. Progressives are concerned the Republican plan would allow billions of dollars to go to business leaders while workers continue to live without pay or health insurance.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are doing a public service by staying home. This isn\u2019t unemployment. This is either government-mandated confinement or voluntary confinement,\u201d said Rob Johnson, president of the <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/\">Institute for New Economic Thinking</a>. \u201cIt makes sense for society as a whole.\u201d</p> <p>Any bailout needs to make sure that those now suffering financial hardship from Covid-19 are protected, he said. \u201cEveryone has a stake in these people being supported.\u201d</p> <p>In Indianapolis, Cox said he was using his newfound unemployment to contact Congress about workers\u2019 needs. As a union representative, he is also fielding calls from confused colleagues and helping people without internet do online applications for unemployment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The idea of a tipped worker going without tips for eight weeks or more is one of the most frightening things to have to confront</p> <footer> <cite>Taylor Cox</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cPeople are scared, people don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Cox said. \u201cThe idea of a tipped worker going without tips for eight weeks or more is one of the most frightening things to have to confront. A lot of the people who work there are people with children, single mothers, who rely on money coming in every day.\u201d</p> <p>His partner also lost their job because of coronavirus, leaving their household with zero income. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this really terrible situation but at least we\u2019re all in this together,\u201d Cox said.</p> <p>Cox is a member of the union Unite Here, which represents 300,000 people in industries hard hit by closures including hospitality, food service, manufacturing and transportation. Last week, the union estimated 80% to 90% of its members would be out of work, but Unite Here\u2019s international president, D Taylor, upped that estimate to 95% on Monday.</p> <p>\u201cHotels are shutting down, casinos are shutting down, so all those jobs in there, from a housekeeper to a cook to a cocktail waitress to a bartender to a bellman, they all have been lost,\u201d Taylor said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f221c09d307f7d692c48b112ffef630d3df456c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f221c09d307f7d692c48b112ffef630d3df456c7/0_19_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An employee of Junior\u2019s Restaurant, which laid off employees due to coronavirus, picks up a paycheck in Brooklyn, New York, on 19 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An employee of Junior\u2019s Restaurant, which laid off employees due to coronavirus, picks up a paycheck in Brooklyn, New York, on 19 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/03/17/the-places-a-covid-19-recession-will-likely-hit-hardest/\">The Brookings Institution thinktank said more than 24.2 million</a> Americans work in the five high-risk sectors facing a sharp slowdown. This includes travel, hospitality, employment services, transportation and energy centers, such as Texas oil and gas towns.</p> <p>The most affected places are famed for their resorts and leisure activities, such as Maui, Hawaii and Las Vegas, Nevada, according to the thinktank.</p> <p>But Taylor said he was worried about every city in every region of North America. \u201cEvery one of our cities is destroyed right now as far as people out of work,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In Boston, Sam Huertas, a catering attendant at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), watched with worry as the university began cancelling events of 150 people, then 100 people, then 50.</p> <p>By the time MIT announced all events would be cancelled through 15 May - the busy season for the university\u2019s caterers \u2013 he had realized filing for unemployment in Boston would be tricky. A common unemployment eligibility requirement is for applicants to show they are actively seeking a job, but industries like catering are almost completely shut down. \u201cWhen I saw other big event spaces were closing, I started realizing things might get complicated in Boston,\u201d Huertas said.</p> <p>So he decided to move, temporarily, to live with his girlfriend\u2019s family in Maine, where there are more opportunities for work because it has not yet been hard hit by coronavirus.</p> <p>It was a step forward, but still riddled with uncertainty, until MIT called him on Saturday and said he would be paid as normal through 22 May. \u201cWhen I found out, that was kind of life-changing,\u201d Huertas said.</p> <p>Huertas said the support from his employer gave him and his co-workers a sigh of relief. Huertas said: \u201cI have a little more hope for getting through this well.\u201d</p> <p>More working people need to feel that hope, said Johnson. \u201cThis is like a wartime economy,\u201d he said. The government needs to decide what its goals are \u201cand get them done\u201d.<br></p>",
