  "<p>When the publisher Martin Hughes talks about the moment five weeks ago when the coronavirus crisis first hit Australia full throttle, he talks about panic. \u201cPanic in the community, the business community and the publishing community. Everyone was looking for plan B.\u201d</p> <p>The CEO of Affirm Press, Hughes was about to oversee the release of two big titles when the shutdowns started \u2013 Pip Williams\u2019 escapist historical drama, The Dictionary of Lost Words, and forthcoming thriller The Safe Place by Anna Downes. Rights had been sold internationally for both debut novels, and staff had been working on the publicity campaigns since January. The dilemma: \u201cThese are big books, it\u2019s really important for our business that these go well; do we move them [back] now that certain parts of the infrastructure are crumbling?\u201d</p> <p>The kinds of calculations that Hughes and his team made five weeks ago have been happening in publishing houses around the country as the coronavirus crisis and shutdown measures to control it take a massive bite out of the arts sector.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/23/malcolm-turnbull-memoir-new-book-a-bigger-picture-bestseller-after-launch\">Malcolm Turnbull's book A Bigger Picture 'a bestseller' days after launch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other publishers were postponing their releases, in some cases for 12 or 18 months. Trent Dalton\u2019s follow-up to his bestselling Boy Swallows Universe has been held by HarperCollins until September; novelist Kathryn Heyman announced last week that her forthcoming memoir has been postponed by Allen &amp; Unwin until 2021. Hughes and his team, however, foresaw a frenzy of delayed big-name titles all coming out at once. They felt that releasing books in that competitive landscape would hurt more than it helped.</p> <p>\u201cWe decided we\u2019d stick with plan A,\u201d Hughes tells Guardian Australia.</p> <p>There were early signs that the enforced stay-at-home measures were having a positive effect on book sales. Nielsen Book Australia reported industry revenue for the week ending 28 March \u2013 the first of widespread shutdowns \u2013 was up 15% on the same time last year. But it has since <a href=\"https://www.asauthors.org/news/sales-data-for-authors-applying-for-jobkeeper\">reported</a> a \u201csharp decline\u201d in the following weeks, and Bianca Whiteley from Nielsen told Guardian Australia that the Australian book market had recorded a 7.1% decline in value sales in 2020 so far, though unit sales were up slightly, at 1.5%. Children\u2019s books and adult fiction were strongest, while trade nonfiction has continued to slow.</p> <p>The reasons for the decline are multifaceted: the books industry relies on an ecosystem of bookstores, festivals, events and media interest to shift copies. Many bookstores have shut their physical premises since the lockdowns started, airports are closed, festivals cancelled. Manufacturing and supply have also been affected \u2013 early on in the crisis, shutdowns in China caused printing delays; more recently, increased burdens on freight and logistics networks are affecting stock management and distribution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edf0398dfebd9d9570c1c8d25e8e43bbc6f5bd33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edf0398dfebd9d9570c1c8d25e8e43bbc6f5bd33/0_0_3500_1576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some bookstores in Australia have started up free local bicycle delivery services during the lockdowns\" width=\"1000\" height=\"450\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some bookstores in Australia have started up free local bicycle delivery services during the lockdowns.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cordelia Hsu/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many publishing houses have responded to the market shocks by reducing salaries and cutting staff. Thames and Hudson, Allen &amp; Unwin and Hardie Grant have cut salaries locally by up to 25%, with the latter also making seven of its 200 staff redundant. Melbourne-based small press Scribe issued redundancies to two of its 27 staff, an editor and a publicist \u2013 the first time the publishing house has made anyone redundant in its 44-year history.</p> <p>Affirm is in the unusual position of having neither laid off staff nor reduced hours. It doesn\u2019t rely on deals with bigger publishing houses to sell to retailers, so it has that advantage over similarly sized companies who are at the mercy of their larger competitors. Nevertheless, uncertainty is still rippling through the industry. Hughes says his own staff\u2019s fears were quelled somewhat by the fact that he was upfront with them about the company\u2019s contingency plans: \u201c[We told them that] if we had to reduce overheads in a hurry \u2026 we would all go down to 80% of our salary if needed, but that any pain that had to be felt would be felt evenly across the team.\u201d</p> <p>Likely also helping morale is the fact that The Dictionary of Lost Words has been one of the fastest selling books this month. It\u2019s no prime ministerial memoir \u2013 Hardie Grant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/23/malcolm-turnbull-memoir-new-book-a-bigger-picture-bestseller-after-launch\">reported on Friday</a> that Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s A Bigger Picture has sold more than 50,000 copies in four days \u2013 but it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/16/all-words-are-not-equal-the-debut-novelist-whos-become-a-lockdown-sensation\">a solid showing for debut fiction</a>, especially with so many curtailed publicity avenues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4c47f222defefb5432c7795b8caf5dbea11b3961\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c47f222defefb5432c7795b8caf5dbea11b3961/0_0_1664_2500/667.jpg\" alt=\"Australian author James Bradley\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian author James Bradley, whose novels include Wrack, The Resurrectionist, Clade and the forthcoming Ghost Species.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>James Bradley, whose seventh novel, Ghost Species, is out on 27 April, describes the usual book tour for an Australian author with a new release: \u201cYou\u2019d go to several capital cities, you\u2019d do some events, you\u2019d do a lot of radio, and you\u2019d probably visit a number of bookshops,\u201d he says. That would be followed by a run of interstate appearances, usually in the form of panels or keynote addresses over the autumn and winter festival season.</p> <p>While sales yields from festival appearances can vary, the direct income to a writer from the event fee is often more important \u2013 something Bradley says has become more apparent in the decades since 1997, when he published his first book. \u201cAs the book trade has changed, I think authors tend to make more of their money from those ancillary events and appearances than they did when I was first writing.\u201d</p> <p>Bookstore visits and signings also make a noticeable difference to sales, and the curatorial aspect of a physical store, geared towards browsing \u2013 tables of new releases, posters, staff picks and so on \u2013 are difficult to replicate online.</p> <p>Still, some literary organisations have tried to adapt to the new world. The Sydney Writers\u2019 festival has started to schedule online panels; the Wheeler Centre collaborated with the Stella prize to stream the prize ceremony via YouTube; the prestigious Vogel award for an unpublished manuscript followed suit; and smaller festivals like the Emerging Writers festival have been running digital supplementary programs for years.</p> <p>The Melbourne Writers festival, which was not scheduled to take place until August, announced in mid-April that it would be putting forward \u201ca smaller online program to keep literary arts audiences connected\u201d. A festival spokesperson told Guardian Australia that while it was too early to put a number on events, they were planning the digital program to run across the previously announced dates of 7-16 August.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At the moment I think it is difficult to have a conversation about anything other than coronavirus</p> <footer> <cite>James Bradley, author</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>MWF\u2019s early forecasts are not promising for those hoping to see digital events become sustainable through ticket sales: the festival is \u201cexploring opportunities for ticketing a digital program\u201d but expects revenue to drop by a third as a consequence of being unable to run in-person events \u2013 an amount roughly equivalent to its income from ticket sales. They say the organisation will rely on philanthropy and sponsorship to tide it over.</p> <p>New outfits are popping up, too. The Pulitzer-prize winner Andrew Sean Greer, Irish novelist Colum McCann and musician Amanda Palmer will headline a new online-only, rolling writers festival, <a href=\"https://www.together-remotely.com/\">Together Remotely</a>, created and curated by the former SWF director and Stella prize shortlistee, Caro Llewellyn. Llewellyn says she launched into action after 10 days in lockdown, \u201cwatching in despair as cultural programs and gatherings, literary launches and events were falling over like dominoes\u201d.</p> <p>There remains, however, the ever-present challenge of getting audiences to pay attention.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/21/the-world-my-book-is-published-into-looks-very-different-from-the-world-i-started-writing-in\">The world my book is published into looks very different from the world I started writing in | Ronnie Scott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bradley feels lucky that the themes of his book \u2013 the ethics of our schemes to fix a world falling apart from environmental crisis \u2013 resonate with the coronavirus crisis, but he acknowledges that many writers may be facing a profound sense of irrelevancy.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment I think it is difficult to have a conversation about anything other than coronavirus, and I think that does make promoting a book which is about other things more difficult.\u201d</p> <p>He says most of his worries are reserved for the sector in the medium to long term. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened is a huge shock, which means that everything marginal collapses \u2013 and the problem is the entire publishing and arts sector is marginal.\u201d What little government support there is has come too little, too late: \u201cThey starved the arts sector for 20 years and now we\u2019re just not in any position to survive.\u201d</p> <p>Hughes, meanwhile, is more optimistic about the industry\u2019s capacity to rally. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pulling together really well,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think there\u2019ll always be a soft spot for people whose debuts, in particular, were affected by the coronavirus crisis.\u201d</p>",

Last week, in the third and last episode of the third series, we got up to the 1970s.</p> <p>The three series have been riveting, so check out the earlier shows. Peters presents beautifully, and I forgive him for being the standard \u201dreads out what\u2019s in front of you\u201d actor host, because he has a long connection with UK music (through <em>Five Guys Named Moe</em>), because he was Lester Freamon in <em>The Wire</em> and because, well, he does his job so well. </p> <p>But, as ever, the true credit should go to the producer; this time, Tom Woolfenden from Loftus Media. It was Woolfenden who found the relevant archives, whether that be Neneh Cherry talking in 2011 about her father, the jazz musician Don Cherry; Martin Simpson, in 2005, explaining the Moroccan way of tuning a guitar; John Craven doing a <em>Newsround</em> round-up of the 1975 decolonisation of Suriname. And it was Woolfenden who did the interviews: with Johny Pitts, the British writer of <em>Afropean</em>; Surinamese flute player Ronald Snijders in the Netherlands; Patrick Bebey, son of Cameroonian guitarist and composer Francis Bebey; Janet Kay, of Silly Games fame\u2026 So many excellent interviews: informative and detailed, well edited, revelatory. They underpin these shows.</p> <p>The story, this series, is of post-colonialism, and how the people of former British, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch and Belgian colonies used their newly given freedom (after the second world war, many colonial countries waived restrictions on visitors from colonies) to come to Europe. Many stayed. And over and over again, those that did stay explain how it\u2019s this consequent mix of cultures that results in their brilliant music. They make us understand that it\u2019s not just the bumping up of different musical techniques, but how the new arrivals\u2019 optimism and hope were muddied and muddled with the racism that they encountered, and how they eventually reclaimed their musical heritage to show it off to Europe. It\u2019s this musical melange that creates the gorgeous soundtrack that we hear throughout the shows. And, in the background, the political culture is creaking. General Franco and Eric Clapton make passing appearances, as baddies.</p> <p>A lot of work has gone into this series and it shows. When a flamenco dancer walks into a Spanish studio, we hear her footsteps; her voice is beautifully recorded. The levels of music and speech are impeccable, the sound moving from ear to ear in your headphones, but remaining clear at all times. It\u2019s all lovely stuff. There\u2019s a list of the tracks played on the show\u2019s website: the BBC should make it into a playlist and put it up on Sounds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca85b382f4f6fed2efb938fdac6d3cc245dd294b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca85b382f4f6fed2efb938fdac6d3cc245dd294b/0_0_3008_1960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neil MacGregor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neil MacGregor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a different angle on colonialism, Neil MacGregor\u2019s classic series <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nrtd2/broadcasts/upcoming\">The History of the World In 100 Objects</a></strong> is being repeated, reassuringly, on Radio 4.
