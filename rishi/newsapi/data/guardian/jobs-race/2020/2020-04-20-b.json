  "<p>Everything unravels with almost indecent speed. After a brush with death, the prime minister is still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/boris-johnson-leaves-hospital-as-he-continues-recovery-from-coronavirus\">recovering at Chequers</a> when one of his many supportive newspapers drops a grenade straight down his Elizabethan chimney. No period of grace and convalescence: the Sunday Times didn\u2019t even wait for him to stumble back to Downing Street before firing off <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/past-six-days/2020-04-19/news/coronavirus-38-days-when-britain-sleepwalked-into-disaster-hq3b9tlgh\">its devastating attack</a> on his cavalier incompetence over the coronavirus outbreak. </p> <p>What makes the insiders\u2019 account so devastating is that it chimes with everything everyone already knows about Boris Johnson\u2019s character. An unnamed \u201csenior adviser\u201d to Downing Street \u201cbroke ranks\u201d to say: \u201cWhat you learn about Boris was he didn\u2019t chair any meetings. He liked his country breaks. He didn\u2019t work weekends. It was like working for an old-fashioned chief executive in a local authority 20 years ago. There was a real sense that he didn\u2019t do urgent crisis planning. It was exactly like people feared he would be.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19-nhs\">The world needs a coronavirus vaccine. But it will take time | Patrick Vallance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Exaggerated or not, hearing that the prime minister took two weeks\u2019 holiday at Chevening as the virus began to spread in the UK will stick in the public memory. Nor will anyone forget his cheery 3 March boast that he was still shaking hands with virus-sufferers. Nor that he was at Twickenham for a crowded rugby match on 7 March. But above all, he missed not one but all of the first five Cobra meetings on the gathering crisis. Gordon Brown chaired every single Cobra meeting on foot and mouth \u2013 when only the health of animals was at stake. Johnson is charged with wasting 38 days before taking serious action against an epidemic approaching in plain sight. In his mind, China was far away. And even when Italy suffered the full horror \u2013 despite being better prepared, with more beds and more intensive care units \u2013 well, that was just Italy.</p> <p>No one elected Boris Johnson to cope with a plague. The small group of ageing activists in the Tory party selected him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/20/boris-johnson-get-brexit-done-lies\">for his Brexitry</a> \u2013 and they liked the cut of his cheery jib. He was fun, upbeat, popular and, above all, he had swung the Brexit vote to victory. Michael Gove reported on Sunday that the prime minister is \u201cin cheerful spirits\u201d, but that\u2019s bafflingly inappropriate. Cheerful? About what? Good croquet on the blossom-strewn Chequers lawns? There are scores of dead doctors and nurses among some 20,000 dead citizens, and rising. Here is the wrong man in the wrong job at the wrong time \u2013 the polar opposite of Winston Churchill\u2019s arrival in power.</p> <p>What makes Johnson supremely unsuited to this particular darkest hour is his natural antipathy towards the state. In <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-in-greenwich-3-february-2020\">a speech</a> mainly on Brexit in Greenwich on 3 February, he attacked Wuhan-style lockdowns: \u201cWe are starting to hear some bizarre autarkic rhetoric, when barriers are going up, and when there is a risk that new diseases such as coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation.\u201d He went on: \u201cHumanity needs some government somewhere that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange.\u201d He was that government, along with Donald Trump. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19\">Herd immunity</a>\u201d was Johnson\u2019s policy until it became politically unsustainable.

And the Guardian revealed that, under austerity, there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/revealed-value-of-uk-pandemic-stockpile-fell-by-40-in-six-years\">a deliberate </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/revealed-value-of-uk-pandemic-stockpile-fell-by-40-in-six-years\"> 40% cut</a> in emergency personal protective equipment stockpiled for an epidemic.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, is calling for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/labour-urges-government-publish-findings-2016-pandemic-drill\">publication of the findings</a> of a three-day epidemic simulation in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/government-under-fire-failing-pandemic-recommendations\">Exercise Cygnus</a>, which uncovered a critical shortage of intensive care beds, morgue capacity and PPE. The government is refusing freedom of information requests, so that may have to wait for the inevitable public inquiry. As will final details of the failure to test, trace, isolate and treat every single case, which the World Health Organization now says should be a pre-condition before countries loosen their lockdowns. None of these things are in place in the UK, nowhere near.</p> <p>Yesterday the NHS Confederation and NHS Providers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/19/hospital-leaders-hit-out-government-ppe-shortage-row-escalates-nhs\">finally lost patience</a> with government dishonesty over wishful targets and plans: just tell us plain facts, they demanded.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/20/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-against-lifting-lockdown-over-second-wave-fears\">UK coronavirus live: No 10 says priority is avoiding second peak of infections when it considers easing lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No government could be fully ready for this: future lessons will be learned from South Korea and others. But this we know: our government is singularly unsuited to the task and unfit for purpose. In his absence, Johnson\u2019s lack of seriousness is reflected in his abysmal choice of cabinet, selected for all the wrong reasons. Dominic Raab, Priti Patel, Elizabeth Truss and the rest were chosen for Brexitry and hatred of the state.

There\u2019s no evidence their worldview has changed.</p> <p>Dominic Cummings was brought in by Johnson to swing a wrecking ball at Whitehall, local councils, the BBC and anything that smelled of good government. No surprise that those who don\u2019t believe in the state have made the worst possible fist of running it in a crisis. Brexit embodied their mindset: break away, break things and disrupt. When the prime minister returns, his single most reassuring act would be to prolong immediately the Brexit transition: yet last week No 10 said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/15/eu-and-uk-government-to-resume-post-brexit-talks-next-week\">it would reject </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/15/eu-and-uk-government-to-resume-post-brexit-talks-next-week\">an extension</a>, even if the EU offered it. If Johnson blunders on as the economy collapses, then we shall truly know we are in the hands of fanatics.</p> <p>Ultimately, a public inquiry will examine the state of the country when the virus struck.

How the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/may/13/andrew-lansley-nhs-reforms-unworkable\">Andrew Lansley reforms</a> blew the NHS into fragments; social care was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/26/social-care-funding-crisis-putting-tens-of-thousands-at-risk\">stripped bare</a>; and local government, responsible for public health, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/27/english-councils-warn-worst-is-yet-to-come-on-cuts\">was shredded</a>.
