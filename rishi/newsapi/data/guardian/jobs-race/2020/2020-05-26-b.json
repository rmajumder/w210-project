  "<p>Footage of a confrontation between a black birdwatcher and a white dog walker in Central Park in New York has gone viral, reigniting national debate over everyday racism and a social media storm.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/26/coronavirus-us-live-trump-biden-mask-deaths-100000-latest-news-updates\">Coronavirus US live: Trump and Cuomo to discuss 'major infrastructure program'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The incident follows other infamous instances of white people calling the police after coming upon black people doing everyday things such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">jogging</a>, being in the park or the street, having a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/08/mckinney-texas-black-children-pool-violence\">swim</a>, holding a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/08/gardening-while-black-lawsuit-marc-peeples\">barbecue</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/08/gardening-while-black-lawsuit-marc-peeples\">or merely gardening</a>.</p> \n<p>In the latest incident, which happened at around 8.30am on Monday, the Memorial Day holiday, an African American man, Christian Cooper, was in a patch of dense trees and shrubs known as the Ramble, which is popular with bird watchers and where signs say dogs must be kept on a leash.</p> \n<p>When Cooper asked a woman to leash her exuberant dog, she said she would call the police.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell them there\u2019s an African American man threatening my life,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>As the woman became agitated, Cooper remained calm and recorded part of the incident. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/melodyMcooper/status/1264965252866641920\">Posted to Twitter by his sister</a>, Melody Cooper, the footage was viewed more than 20m times.</p> \n<p>Christian Cooper described the beginning of the encounter, which was not recorded, in a <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10158742137255229&amp;id=671885228\">post</a> on Facebook. He said he saw the dog \u201ctearing through the plantings\u201d and told the owner dogs should be leashed at all times, noting: \u201cThe sign is right there.\u201d After an exchange of remarks, he began recording.</p> \n<p>The video starts with the woman, who is wearing a face mask, saying: \u201cSir, I\u2019m asking you to stop.\u201d</p> \n<p>She approaches him, dragging the struggling dog by its collar. He says: \u201cPlease don\u2019t come close to me.\u201d New York City is still under stay-at-home and social distancing orders amid the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n<p>The woman, later identified as Amy Cooper, asks the man to turn his phone off, then says: \u201cI\u2019m calling the cops.\u201d</p> \n<p>Christian Cooper responds: \u201cPlease call the cops.\u201d</p> \n<p>The woman says: \u201cI\u2019m going to tell them there\u2019s an African American man threatening my life.\u201d</p> \n<p>He says: \u201cTell them whatever you like.\u201d</p> \n<p>Apparently reaching an operator, Amy Cooper says: \u201cThere is a man, African American, he has a bicycle helmet, he is recording me and threatening me and my dog.\u201d</p> \n<p>She wrestles the dog, which struggles and appears to be having difficulty breathing. Raising her voice, she backs away. Christian Cooper remains still.</p> \n<p>In an agitated voice, Amy Cooper says: \u201cI am being threatened by a man in the Ramble, please send the cops immediately.\u201d She then fixes a leash to the dog\u2019s collar.</p> \n<p>Christian Cooper says \u201cThank you\u201d and ends the recording.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday morning, Cooper <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/05/26/amy-cooper-central-park/\">spoke to</a> the Washington Post, which described him as a 57-year-old science editor.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an African American person in America who hasn\u2019t experienced something like this at some point,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Cooper said he often asks dog owners to put the leash on in the Ramble.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t shy away from confronting the scofflaw when I see it,\u201d he said, using <a href=\"https://www.dictionary.com/browse/scofflaw\">a local term</a> for someone who ignores laws which are hard to enforce. \u201cOtherwise, the park would be unusable \u2013 not just to us birders but to anybody who enjoys the beauty.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked about the woman\u2019s decision to call the police, he said: \u201cI can be racially intimidated and kowtow to her [but] I\u2019m not going to participate in my own dehumanization.\u201d</p> \n<p>Police officers attended the call but said no summonses or arrests were made over what the New York police department called \u201ca verbal dispute\u201d.</p> \n<p>Amy Cooper was put on administrative leave by her employer on Monday, the investment firm Franklin Templeton, which said it was investigating.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe take these matters very seriously,\u201d the firm <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTI_US/status/1265111264335986689\">said</a>, \u201cand we do not condone racism of any kind.\u201d</p> \n<p>By Tuesday afternoon she had been fired.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FTI_US/status/1265348185201008641\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Following our internal review of the incident in Central Park yesterday, we have made the decision to terminate the employee involved, effective immediately.

In the book, Pitts visits places like Stockholm\u2019s Rinkeby district, where 90% of inhabitants are migrants, and Clichy Sous Bois in Paris, where the 2005 riots began.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/26/johny-pitts-interview-afropean-notes-black-europe\">Speaking to the Observer in 2019</a>, Pitts said he had learned \u201cthat the black experience can\u2019t be pinned down to a solid thing. As I travelled, I met Tunisians who had a real problem with Somalians in Sweden, or Martinicans who looked down their noses at Senegalese in France. No matter how much I tried to fit it all together, it never fitted perfectly. Yet at the same time, I saw lots of opportunities for black communities to come together and lots of instances where they did. I saw a continent full of opportunity, of commonalities, of possible solidarities, but ultimately what I found empowering was knowing that the continent was full of people like me.\u201d</p> <p>From more than 150 submitted books, Afropean was unanimously named the winner by the judges, poet Roy McFarlane, journalist Anita Sethi, and authors Kerry Young and Nikesh Shukla, the latter having cofounded the prize.</p> <p>Shukla called Afropean an \u201copen-armed book\u201d that \u201cembodies exactly the reasons we set up the prize in the first place\u201d, while McFarlane described it as \u201ca beautiful book to return to time and time again\u201d. Young said it was \u201cexceptionally thoughtful\u201d with a \u201cstrong moral compass.\u201d</p> <p>Pitts\u2019s debut won on a six-book shortlist that included three other first time writers - Candice Carty-Williams\u2019s bestselling novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/16/queenie-candice-carty-williams-review\">Queenie</a>, Yvonne Battle-Felton\u2019s historical novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/22/remembered-by-yvonne-battle-felton-review\">Remembered</a> and Mary Jean Chan\u2019s poetry collection <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/27/poem-of-the-month-the-window-mary-jean-chan-fleche\">Fl\u00e8che</a> \u2013 as well as Romesh Gunesekera\u2019s novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/06/suncatcher-romesh-gunesekera-review\">Suncatcher</a> and Dean Atta\u2019s children\u2019s novel in verse, <a href=\"https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/dean-atta/the-black-flamingo/9781444948592/\">The Black Flamingo</a>.</p> <p>Now in its fourth year, the Jhalak prize was set up in 2016 by authors Sunny Singh and Shukla, and Media Diversified to award the best book by a British or British-resident black, Asian and minority ethnic author. It has previously been won by Jacob Ross, Reni Eddo-Lodge and Guy Gunaratne.</p> <p>In 2017, Tory MP Philip Davies complained to the Equality and Human Rights Commission that the Jhalak prize breached discrimination rules, arguing that the prize was unfair to white authors and was an example of \u201cpositive discrimination\u201d. The EHRC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/28/tory-mps-complaint-that-prize-for-writers-of-colour-was-unfair-to-whites-dismissed\">dismissed his complaint after an investigation</a>, which Singh said had caused \u201cenormous stress\u201d and wasted resources.</p>",
