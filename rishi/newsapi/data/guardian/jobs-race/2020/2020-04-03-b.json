  "<p>The US faces a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\">catastrophic rise in unemployment</a> following the forced shutdown of businesses across the country to stop the spread of Covid-19 \u2013 and experts are warning it could trigger a severe mental health crisis.</p> <p>In just two weeks, more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economy\">9.95 million</a> Americans have applied for unemployment \u2013 smashing all records. Economists are predicting the unemployment rate could rise as high as 30% as the pandemic sweeps across the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economy\">Coronavirus batters US economy as 6.65m file for unemployment last week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those hardest hit are likely to be the poorest, including many people of color, and those who benefited least from the last economic boom.</p> <p>\u201cWith a 30% national unemployment rate, the impact will be devastating for everyone. But it will be particularly crushing for black Americans,\u201d said William Darity, a professor of economics at Duke University and co-author of a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326922726_Race_Unemployment_and_Mental_Health_in_the_USA_What_Can_We_Infer_About_the_Psychological_Cost_of_the_Great_Recession_Across_Racial_Groups\">study</a> that found black Americans with no history of mental health diagnoses were more likely to have depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder during the 2007-09 Great Recession.</p> <p>To mitigate the effects of the massive wave of unemployment, Congress has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">passed</a> a $2.2tn stimulus package to help everyday Americans. The bill includes a payment of up to $1,200 to most taxpayers and $250bn to buffer unemployment insurance \u2013 an additional $600 to those who qualify for unemployment for up to 12 weeks.</p> <p>But beyond the dollar signs, economists are worried about the long-term effects that being unemployed will have on Americans\u2019 mental health \u2013 a problem that will further highlight the cracks in the country\u2019s safety net and healthcare system.</p> <p>It may seem cliche but work is not all about the money, and research proves it. \u201cPeople want to work. They want to do meaningful things,\u201d said Art Goldsmith, a professor of economics at Washington and Lee University who has researched the psychological effects of unemployment.</p> <p>Although Goldsmith noted there is evidence that people experience a brief period of optimism when they are first let go from their jobs \u2013 they find they have more time to do other tasks, like cleaning out a garage \u2013 dangerous feelings of pessimism can set in after four to five weeks of unemployment.</p> <p>\u201cAs the weeks go on, and we see the economy struggling, I think there will be more pessimism. I worry the emotional footprint of this experience can be quite large,\u201d Goldsmith said.</p> <p>\ufeff<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/us-coronavirus-stimulus-all-you-need-to-know\">A $1,200 check</a> from the government and stronger unemployment insurance benefits will help Americans in the short term to pay their bills and other essentials but it cannot replace the value of having a job.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/20/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus-how-to-file-what-to-expect\">What US unemployment benefits can I get during the coronavirus?

An Association for Psychological Science <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/09/190903120522.htm\">study</a> published in September 2019 found that those who experienced financial, housing or job-related hardship during the Great Recession were more likely to have depression, anxiety or substance abuse as many as three years after the recession. A <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/171044/depression-rates-higher-among-long-term-unemployed.aspx\">poll</a> from Gallup conducted in 2014 found that unemployed Americans were more than twice as likely to self-report being treated for depression.</p> <p>Economists are particularly concerned about people who were disenfranchised before the crisis started.</p> <p>Black Americans historically have an unemployment rate that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/17/us-booming-economy-black-americans\">twice as high</a> as the overall rate, even in a healthy economy.</p> <p>\ufeffThe overall <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/\">median wealth</a> for a black family is 10 times less than the median wealth of a white family. Discriminatory job processes have kept black Americans in low-paying jobs, many of which have seen layoffs with Covid-19. \u201cFrom the standpoint of providing for oneself and one\u2019s family, the situation is already significantly less secure for black Americans.\u201d</p> <p>While the mental health toll from unemployment is shared across the globe, America\u2019s weak safety net and lack of affordable healthcare exacerbates the consequences for unemployed Americans.</p> <p>Economists have shown that unemployment and low wages have literally fatal consequences for Americans. In 2015 Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton, winner of the 2015 Nobel prize for economics, found middle-aged white Americans were more likely to die in mid-life than their parents \u2013 reversing decades of steadily increasing life expectancy.</p> <p>They coined the term \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/28/deaths-of-despair-us-jobs-drugs-alcohol-suicide\">deaths of despair</a>\u201d and blamed the rise on suicide, drug overdose or alcohol-related liver disease.</p> <p>Their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/19/us-healthcare-industry-working-class-deaths\">research</a> found geographic and class-related underpinnings to the rise: places that have a smaller fraction of working-age people in jobs are more likely to have higher rates of deaths of despair.</p> <p>The people dying were overwhelmingly white working-age Americans without college degrees. That group of people were finding that their jobs were being valued less than previous generations by the American economy \u2013 they were working for lower wages, inflexible hours and fewer benefits. Many lost jobs to changing technology.</p> <p>Exacerbating the problem has been easy access to addictive opioids and firearms (more than <a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/magazine/magazine_article/guns-suicide/\">half</a> of suicides in America are committed with a firearm). \u201cWe all but load the weapons of self-destruction for people in misery,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/why-americans-are-dying-from-despair\">noted</a> surgeon Atul Gawande in the New Yorker.</p> <p>This economic and mental health crisis will only be deepened by the sudden rise in unemployment. And, in the meantime, many Americans face barriers to getting mental healthcare. While health insurance can offset the cost of therapy and access to a psychiatrist, Americans typically rely on an employer for health insurance and lose access if they are laid off. About 28 million Americans do <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/\">not have health insurance</a> at all.</p> <p>\ufeffCities typically do not rely on a single firm to keep people employed. If a major company shuts down, people can typically find employment elsewhere. But with huge sectors of the service industry \u2013 restaurants, hair salons, hotels \u2013 shutting down amid the pandemic, the mental health toll of this recession is likely to cast a wide net.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to low-skilled, support sectors in the cities if this lasts really long? We\u2019d have whole different population cohorts we haven\u2019t seen before that may also suffer some severe mental health crises,\u201d Graham said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying we shouldn\u2019t social-distance \u2013 we have no choice. But we really need to think about the mental health part of this crisis as much as the economic one.\u201d</p> <p><em>In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

  "<p>Unemployment in Britain and the US could surpass the levels reached during the 1930s Great Depression within months as the coronavirus crisis crushes the global economy, a former Bank of England official has warned.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/recession-depression-data-coronavirus\">In a stark forecast as job losses mount around the world</a>, David Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US and a member of the Bank\u2019s interest rate-setting monetary policy committee during the 2008 financial crisis, said unemployment was rising at the fastest rate in living memory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/recession-depression-data-coronavirus\">Forget 'recession': this is a depression | David Blanchflower and David Bell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Writing in the Guardian, the economist said UK unemployment could rapidly rise to more than 6 million people, around 21% of the entire workforce, based on analysis of US job market figures that suggest unemployment across the Atlantic could reach 52.8 million, around 32% of the workforce.</p> <p>\u201cThere has never been such a concentrated business collapse. The government has tried to respond but it has no idea of the scale of the problem it is going to have to deal with. We make some back-of-the-envelope calculations and they are scary,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Making the assessment alongside David Bell, an economist at the University of Stirling, the former Threadneedle Street policymaker said the collapse in activity amid Covid-19 and the accompanying rise in unemployment looked to be at least 10 times faster than in the recession triggered by the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>The economists said that while government support in Britain for companies to furlough workers could help to cushion the blow, unemployment would still soar. While joblessness would rapidly rise, they cautioned it was uncertain how long the impact would last and how quickly unemployment would come down. During the Great Depression, records show unemployment hit 24.9% in the US and 15.4% in the UK over several years.</p> <p>The warning shot for the two economies comes as business activity in Britain and the eurozone plunges to the lowest levels since the start of closely watched surveys more than two decades ago and as unemployment in the US begins to rise.</p> <p>According to the latest snapshots from the purchasing managers indices (PMI), which are based on surveys of business activity, the private sector economy in the UK and the eurozone collapsed in March at the fastest pace since records began in the late 1990s.</p> <p>The US economy also shed 701,000 jobs, according to March data, far more than the 100,000 fall expected on average by economists. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4%, up from 3.5% in February. Initial unemployment insurance figures, which come in advance of official figures, have suggested joblessness is already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/03/us-jobs-report-march-unemployment-coronavirus\">on track to reach more than 10 million</a>.</p> <p>Stock markets sold off on Friday as the prospect of lasting economic damage becomes increasingly clear. The FTSE 100 closed down more than 1% at 5,415, as share prices tumbled across Europe and the US.</p> <p>The latest health check in Britain from <a href=\"https://www.markiteconomics.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/61f043b216da42618ff2559dd8435bc6?s=1\">IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply</a> (Cips) showed the onset of job losses last month as the government in effect shut down large swathes of the economy.</p> <p>The PMI reading for manufacturing and service sector output, making up the vast majority of UK growth, crashed to 36.0 in March on a scale where anything above 50.0 separates growth from contraction. Down sharply from 53.0 in February, the reading was the worst since records began in 1996.</p> <p>Duncan Brock, group director at Cips, said: \u201cIt\u2019s increasingly difficult to find the words to describe the devastation as every region in the world fights to save human life as the first priority.

But there were also notable declines in healthcare (down 61,00), retail (down 46,000), professional and business services (down 52,000) and construction (down 29,000).</p> <p>The number of unemployed persons who reported being on temporary layoff more than doubled in March to 1.8 million.</p> <p>The treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, and others have speculated unemployment could rise to 30% in the coming months with economists worrying that the US now faces a recession of a depth unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s unless a solution is found that will allow people to go back to work.</p> <p>Forecasting firm Oxford Economics is predicting a 16% unemployment rate by May with the loss of 27.9m jobs, more than double the 8.7m jobs cut during the 2007-2009 recession and its aftermath. Those jobs were lost over more than two years.</p> <p>If the unemployment climbs above 15%, it would be the highest on record since 1940. Unemployment touched 10% in October 2009 during the last recession. The previous peak was in 1982, when it reached 10.8%. Unemployment during the Great Depression peaked at 24.9% in 1933.</p> <p>Earlier this week ADP, the US\u2019s largest payroll processor, said private employers cut a total of 27,000 jobs last month. Small businesses have been particularly hard hit as the pandemic has shaken the US economy. They cut 90,000 jobs and the total number was buoyed up by gains in other sectors.</p> <p>ADP\u2019s survey too was conducted in mid-March and the company said it did \u201cnot fully reflect the most recent impact of Covid-19 on the employment situation\u201d.</p> <p>The true impact of the coronavirus on the jobs market will probably start appearing in next month\u2019s report. The number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits has now broken records for two weeks in a row, with more people seeking assistance than at any point in the last recession.</p> <p>In the last two weeks more people filed for unemployment than the combined number of people who filed in the first 10 months of the year.</p>"
