  "<p>An additional 4.4 million Americans filed for unemployment last week adding to a total of over 26 million since the coronavirus pandemic shut down swaths of the US and brought its economy to a standstill.</p> <p>The latest Department of Labor <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf\">figures</a> show the pace of layoffs appears to have slowed slightly but a backlog of claims mean millions more are likely to file in the coming weeks. States across the country are encountering problems with the sheer number of people applying for unemployment benefits.</p> <p>In Florida, bedevilled by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/florida-unemployment-system-coronavirus-applications\">widespread collapse</a> of its already flawed benefits system,<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/21/politics/florida-unemployment-benefits-processing/index.html\"> just 14.2% </a>of the more than 668,000 claims filed since 15 March have been paid. In Ohio, claimants now have to file on a specific day of the week, depending on the first letter of their last name, to ease congestion. Washington residents are complaining that the state\u2019s website <a href=\"https://komonews.com/news/coronavirus/frustration-with-states-unemployment-benefits-website-mounts\">crashes or takes hours to respond.</a></p> <p>Latasha Johnson, 41, has been struggling to get by without a paycheck for a month. In mid-March, she was laid off from her job in dining services at the University of Illinois, where she was employed by the British-based multinational Compass.</p> <p>She had no severance and it took a month for her to file an unemployment claim because the site was overwhelmed.</p> <p>Johnson said it was especially difficult because she is a single mother. \u201cI pay for all my bills on my own, I don\u2019t have any outside help, outside resources, I am doing everything by myself,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge, huge struggle.\u201d</p> <p>Now, she\u2019s waiting for her first unemployment check, which is a fraction of what she made before. She said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/us-coronavirus-stimulus-all-you-need-to-know\">$1,200 stimulus check</a> from the government will also do little to help her situation.</p> <p>\u201cIf you are releasing it in the month of April and I pay my bills for May where does that leave me for June, July, August?\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe\u2019re at a standstill because we don\u2019t know when the city will open back up.\u201d</p> <p>Jobless claims, laid-off workers\u2019 applications for unemployment insurance payments, have never risen this high so fast. The losses have wiped out all the job gains made since the end of the last recession.</p> <p>Lenny Kiefer, the deputy chief economist at Freddie Mac whose dramatic animated charts of the weekly numbers have gone viral on Twitter, described the latest losses as \u201coff the charts both figuratively and literally\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lenkiefer/status/1253306505216098307\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">off the charts both figuratively and literally <a href=\"https://t.co/Sgq9MfR2oC\">pic.twitter.com/Sgq9MfR2oC</a></p>&mdash; \ud83d\udcc8 \ud835\ude7b\ud835\ude8e\ud835\ude97 \ud835\ude7a\ud835\ude92\ud835\ude8e\ud835\ude8f\ud835\ude8e\ud835\ude9b \ud83d\udcca (@lenkiefer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lenkiefer/status/1253306505216098307?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 23, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Delays in processing applications have boosted the weekly totals in recent weeks but economists believe the unprecedented wave of claims is near its peak.</p> <p>Nomura economist Lewis Alexander said the labor market remained \u201cunder severe strain\u201d but said that \u201cstates that imposed lockdowns relatively early are seeing claims activity improve somewhat.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A second wave of job losses from the coronavirus pandemic could hit the Australian economy as activity in the construction and building industry slows and residential projects dry up.</p> <p>Tradies are reporting that residential projects are being put on hold as home owners worry about their job security and cash flow, while unions warn that some larger construction projects are being put on ice, particularly in NSW.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian Australia coronavirus email signup button\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Federal Labor estimated on Thursday that new housing starts in the residential sector could fall from 160,000 to 100,000 as people shy away from committing to major projects.</p> <p>Architects have also reported widespread cancellation of projects.</p> <p>A survey by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects of 300 architecture practices at the end of March found that 89% had had projects cancelled or put on hold.

For this reason, governments have often targeted stimulus packages to the sector because they yield significant flow-on effects through the economy.</p> <p>The NSW president of the Master Builders Association, Brian Seidler, said a survey of members last week found the coronavirus crisis was starting to affect both large and small projects.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are wary about starting a kitchen because they worry that the industry will have to pull up stumps and they are stuck at home,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s impacted from the large commercial sector right through to small jobs.\u201d</p> <p>He said the industry had embraced physical distancing rules, given its need to stay open, with the result that there had been only a few cases on building sites.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s housing spokesman, Jason Clare, warned that the slowdown would not become apparent for some time.</p> <p>\u201cAbout a million Aussies are involved in building houses for other Aussies, but as construction on houses wraps up over the next few months, the construction pipeline for new work is drying up,\u201d Clare said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that means there\u2019s a real risk that, for a lot of electricians and plumbers and carpenters around Australia, they could be out of work.\u201d</p> <p>Most large construction sites around the country are still operating, but the national secretary of the Electrical Trades Union, Allen Hicks, warned the coronavirus was having serious impacts.</p> <p>He said Westfield and Google were among large companies that had put projects on hold in NSW, and more pain was ahead.</p> <p>\u201cWe absolutely support social distancing and we are trying to keep as many workers employed and involved in the industry as we can,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut most jobs will take longer, and because most contractors have fixed price contracts, it means that if a job takes four months longer because of the rules, contractors will bear the cost of employing people for longer to finish it.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of companies will go to the wall in three to four months\u2019 time,\u201d he warned.</p> <p>Many contractors cannot demonstrate the fall in revenue required to access the jobkeeper program, even though they face serious problems in a few months.</p> <p>Hicks said that many construction workers were employed as casuals or through labour hire companies and moved between employers, even though they were effectively employed full time.</p> <p>This meant they would be ineligible for jobkeeper once standdowns occurred because they could not demonstrate 12 months continuous employment with one employer. This meant tradies would be forced onto jobseeker and might be lost to the industry.</p> <p>On Thursday the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, called on Scott Morrison to consider a major investment in social housing.</p> <p>\u201cThe prime minister has said that we\u2019ll have snapback [in the economy],\u201d Albanese said. \u201cThe truth is that that won\u2019t occur. We won\u2019t wake up one morning and be through this crisis and be back to where we were.
