  "<p>Without the coronavirus wage subsidies covering 10 million people, the UK would have seen, <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/coronavirus-unemployment-five-nation-comparison.pdf\" title=\"\">judging by others\u2019 experiences</a>, about one in five workers unemployed. Joblessness matters because it hurts. Unemployment is stressful and damages morale; it increases susceptibility to malnutrition, illness, and mental stress. Society pays a high price for such <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/22/we-must-act-now-to-shield-young-people-from-the-economic-scarring-of-covid-19\" title=\"\">scarring</a>. That is why the Treasury\u2019s decision to withdraw the wage subsidies over the next few months of the coronavirus pandemic is a risky gamble that, if it fails, could spell disaster.</p> <p>The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/29/rishi-sunak-confirms-coronavirus-furlough-scheme-to-be-gradually-withdrawn\" title=\"\">announced</a> that if companies want to retain government help to pay 80% of an employee\u2019s total wages, up to a cap of \u00a32,500, they must contribute to their wages, pensions and national insurance until October. For the self-employed, state payments will end by September. This is big news. Nearly a third of the workforce are now reliant on government subsidies for their income. About a seventh are on universal credit.</p> <p>Cutting support can only be sustained if the economy can be roused into life from state-imposed hibernation. Companies will need sales to pay staff. Many companies may not be able to generate income: how many bars and hotels can be run by physically separating their customers? The worry is that some businesses will look at their books \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/businessservices/bulletins/coronavirusandtheeconomicimpactsontheuk/21may2020\" title=\"\">only 43% have cash reserves that would last up to six months</a> \u2013 and think they will have to downsize to stay afloat while the economy remains gripped by a viral stupor. It would have made more sense to scale back the subsidies in step with lifting the lockdown. The worry is that Mr Sunak\u2019s expiration of the furlough scheme represents not the sunlit uplands of normal life, but a cliff that many Britons and the economy are hurtling toward.</p> <p>Unlike many advanced democracies, Britain does not produce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/19/uk-unemployment-rate-furlough-jobs-market\" title=\"\">up-to-date employment statistics</a>. There are no official numbers on the effect coronavirus has had on unemployment. From what we do know, the consequences are unlikely to be good news. Those losing jobs look certain to struggle to find new ones: while the claimant count rose 856,000 to 2.1 million in April, the biggest monthly rise since modern records began in 1971, there was a 170,000 drop in job vacancies in the three months to April.</p> <p>The chancellor was expected to spend more than \u00a380bn (about 3.7% of annual GDP) on such support over the next eight months. In withdrawing the wage support he has bowed to the orthodox Treasury view that such spending was unsustainable. Yet there is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/uk-budget-deficit-to-rise-to-300bn-this-year-obr-says\" title=\"\">strong case</a> to suggest that the scale of the government support for the economy was smaller than in many other countries \u2013 and that it should be enlarged, not shrunk. If Mr Sunak has miscalculated and is removing cash too quickly, he risks businesses going under and the spike in unemployment he has been trying to avoid \u2013 all of which will make it even harder to escape from the coronavirus crisis.</p>",

  "<p>We were surprised when an albino pheasant (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/fine-food-and-old-tights\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 22 May) took up residence with our seven domestic chickens last year. They seemed to coexist happily for a few weeks, sharing the same food, although the pheasant roosted elsewhere. We\u2019ve not seen it this year and don\u2019t know what happened to it.<br><strong>Stephen Ross</strong><br><em>High Biggins, Cumbria</em></p> <p>\u2022 Last year I saw an albino pheasant occasionally on walks through local countryside. The last time I saw it, it was among several other pheasants hanging in the back of a gamekeeper\u2019s quad cycle after a shoot. How jolly unsporting, I thought!<br><strong>Alex Allan</strong><br><em>Gore End, Hampshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 A magnificent pheasant used to visit us regularly. We named him Algernon, in tribute to his aristocratic air. Every time we said, \u201cGood morning, Algernon\u201d, he corrected us indignantly with \u201cUrquhart, Urquhart\u201d. So Urquhart he became.<br><strong>Sue Atkins</strong><br><em>Lewes, East Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 When we moved to our house on a farm in the Scottish Borders, some 46 years ago, there were five or six albino pheasants, the pride of the owner. Woe betide anyone who shot one. Sadly they are no more.<br><strong>Bill Cook</strong><br><em>Kelso, Scottish Borders</em></p> <p>\u2022 In the early 1940s I saw a white pheasant on my grandmother\u2019s farm in Carisbrooke, Isle of Wight. It was seen for more than one season. Here in Dorset a white-tailed blackbird has inhabited our garden and that of our neighbours for the last two years.<br><strong>Malcolm Rice</strong><br><em>West Parley, Dorset</em></p> <p>\u2022 My wife and I saw one out of our bedroom window last November. In our back garden we\u2019ve a semi-albino blackbird too. Something in the water?<br><strong>John Taylor</strong><br><em>Kingston, Devon</em></p> <p>\u2022 We\u2019ve seen several white pheasants over the years in the hills overlooking the beautiful Ceiriog Valley in north Wales, where we are so lucky to live.<br><strong>Ieuan Roberts</strong><br><em>Glyn Ceiriog, Llangollen</em></p> <p>\u2022 I had one in my garden when I lived in urban Wolverhampton.<br><strong>Tony Bayliss</strong><br><em>Sandon, Essex</em></p> <p>\u2022 I saw one last week here in Rutland.<br><strong>Dan Howison</strong><br><em>Exton, Rutland</em></p> <p>\u2022 I was more fortunate than David Clark as I was only 70 when an albino cock pheasant spent several days in my garden, then in south Shropshire, in the winter of 2004.<br><strong>Jennifer Hewitt</strong><br><em>Wendover, Buckinghamshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 While living in the Suffolk village of Stutton in the mid-1980s, I saw a flock of pheasants passing through the fields immediately behind my flat. There was always one all-white bird in the flock. There was also one black-feathered pheasant.<br><strong>Richard James</strong><br><em>Highworth, Wiltshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I saw a pure white albino pheasant a few weeks ago while out cycling. It was pheasant-shaped and in the company of other normally coloured pheasants, so I am pretty sure it wasn\u2019t a duck, but David Clark\u2019s letter increased my certainty.<br><strong>Mark Smith</strong><br><em>Sandbach, Cheshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I saw such a bird at Hartland Moor national nature reserve, Dorset.

Maybe this beautiful county is becoming a hotspot for them.<br><strong>Tim Watson</strong><br><em>Newcastle upon Tyne</em></p> <p>\u2022 I spotted an albino pheasant here in Dorset a few weeks ago. A very beautiful creature with bright red cheek patches.<br><strong>Christopher Sharp</strong><br><em>Henley, Dorset</em></p> <p>\u2022 Some year ago my wife and I saw an albino pheasant in the valley leading to Penant Melangell, near Llangynog. According to report there is always such a bird in the valley and it is considered very bad form to shoot it.<br><strong>Ian Randall</strong><br><em>Fakenham, Norfolk</em></p> <p>\u2022 A rather weedy albino pheasant lived in the woods near us at New Barns in Arnside, a few years ago, and occasionally wandered into our garden. It survived for about three years as local shooters were told to spare it, but I heard that it did end up eventually stuffed, and on somebody\u2019s mantlepiece. <br><strong>David Humphreys</strong><br><em>Arnside, Cumbria</em></p> <p>\u2022 Where I was brought up in North Yorkshire, in the 1950s, we used to regularly see a male albino pheasant in one particular area just north of Helmsley.

  "<p>It has been called the \u201cMinnesota paradox\u201d. The Twin Cities, comprising the conjoined urban areas of Minneapolis and St Paul, regularly tops the list of places in the US with the best quality of living.</p> <p>Largely low rise and sprawling, set around the cities\u2019 lakes and the Mississippi, the area is marked by affordable and largely good quality housing with lawns, parks, museums and tree-lined streets.</p> <p>Its politics too have long reflected a strong progressive strand, represented by figures such as the late senator Paul Wellstone, once described as the most liberal member of the Senate. Employment \u2013 pre-pandemic, at least \u2013 was high, and St Paul serves as the global headquarters for 3M.</p> <p>But there is another side to living in Minnesota, often ignored. Factor in the black and ethnic minority experience, and the state is suddenly not such a good place to live.</p> <p>Despite Minneapolis celebrating itself as the city of Prince and Paisley Park, Minnesota\u2019s black education and employment outcomes by US national standards have long been dismal in comparison with those of the state\u2019s white population.</p> <p>Rated in 2018 second in terms of overall best states in which to live in the US, in the same year Minnesota ranked close to the bottom for both employment gap by race (47th) and income gap by race (38th).&nbsp;</p> <p>According to a report released last year, even before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/28/jobless-america-unemployment-coronavirus-in-figures\">mass unemployment triggered by the coronavirus</a> took hold, some 10% of black American residents of the Twin Cities were unemployed compared with just under 4% of white American residents. Given the pandemic\u2019s disproportionate impact on communities of color, that already bad situation has now worsened.</p> <p>The reality of Minneapolis and St Paul is that behind the veneer of \u201cMinnesota nice\u201d, behind the reputation of a socially liberal and highly tolerant metropolitan area (in contrast with the state\u2019s more conservative rural areas), there have long been glaring divisions along racial lines in a place where 20% of the population is African-American.</p> <p>Despite having a white mayor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/jacob-frey-donald-trump-minneapolis-mayor-tweets-riots\">Jacob Frey</a>, who has been outspoken about the problems of structural racism, and being located in the same congressional district that elected Ilhan Omar, the state\u2019s first non-white woman to be elected to Congress, race relations have foundered on chronic inequalities and a series of high-profile killings of black people involving the 800-strong police force.</p> <p>As the academic Samuel Myers, who coined the notion of the Minnesota paradox, pointed out two years ago, it is not only in employment and income gaps that the paradox exists, pointing to racial disparities in incarceration rates, in child maltreatment report rates, educational outcomes, and even racial disparities in drowning rates.</p> <p>Among all these indicators, it is education that has witnessed one of the worst disparities, despite this being acknowledged as a problem by state officials and leading to a current restructuring effort to try to address the inequalities.</p> <p>According to a report last year, while 95.9% of white adults in the Twin Cities metro area have a high school diploma, one of the highest figures in the US, just 82.2% of black adults do, a number below the national black high school attainment rate of 84.9%.</p> <p>Add to all that the dangerous accelerant of the issue of police violence against black people, including the police shootings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philando-castile-shooting\">Philand</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philando-castile-shooting\">o Castile</a> in 2016 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/31/jamar-clark-police-killing-no-charges-minneapolis-protesters\">Jamar Clark </a>in 2015, which led to protests that shut down some of the city\u2019s highways, and what occurred this week becomes more understandable.</p> <p>Finally, as one resident pointed out to the Guardian, the impact of the coronavirus \u2013 not least its devastating economic impact on the poorest and least protected communities \u2013 has fed the simmering anger that existed before George Floyd\u2019s killing.</p> <p>All of which has left a journey along Minneapolis\u2019s historic east-west thoroughfare Lake Street, location of the 3<sup>rd</sup> police precinct which was attacked after the Floyd killing, as a metaphor for many of the tensions.</p> <p>A longtime magnet for new immigrants, from Scandinavians in the 19<sup>th</sup> century through black Americans during the Great Migration and those who relocated from cities such as Chicago in the 60s and 70s, to Hispanic, Hmong and most recently Somali immigrants, this street underlines the disparities.</p> <p>Running from uptown with its wealthy homes, and bookended by the middle class neighborhoods close to the river where Black Lives Matter placards proliferated on lawns in 2016 after Castile\u2019s killing, it also traverses poorer neighborhoods with immigrant-run businesses.</p> <p>It was not always this way. While race relations in the state have largely mirrored the wider experience of the US, the Twin Cites in the 60s and 70s were seen for the African Americans who relocated there as a place with access to jobs and good schooling.</p> <p>But race in Minnesota has become foregrounded even more in the Trump era, as some local rightwing politicians in towns such as Saint Cloud, outside the metropolitan area, have fostered anti-immigrant sentiment aimed largely at Somalis and Latinos.</p> <p>All of which led Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/opinion/george-floyd-minneapolis.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">write in the New York Times</a> that what is \u201cunmistakable in the bitter protests in Minneapolis and around the country is the sense that the state is either complicit or incapable of effecting substantive change\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>Do you remember the ABC movement a few years back, when we were all asking restaurants for anything but chardonnay (while still, typically, claiming that we liked chablis, which is, of course, made from the chardonnay grape). Now it seems that ABSB (anything but sauvignon blanc) would be more appropriate, although I know it has its die-hard fans.</p> <p>Supermarkets love the stuff, because it sells by the crateload, but there are so many more interesting wines out there to enjoy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/sep/09/almost-famous-less-well-known-wines\">my latest enthusiasm being aligot\u00e9</a>. Some of you may shudder at the thought, remembering the tooth-strippingly acidic wines of your youth, made drinkable only by adding a good slosh of cassis. These days, however, there are some very fine examples, as I was reminded recently by a young French importer, L\u00e9a Delacourcelle of <a href=\"https://dejabuwines.co.uk/\">D\u00e9j\u00e0 Bu Wines</a>.</p> <p>Delacourcelle, who comes from Burgundy, had the misfortune to start her tiny business supplying restaurants at the end of last year, so she is now selling to the public directly. She, too, has a passion for aligot\u00e9. \u201cYou get some top producers playing with it, because there are fewer restrictions on how you can make it and you can have a bit of fun,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The wines are similar in character to chablis, but have a pure, thrilling, linear intensity to them. I particularly like the mouth-tingling fresh acidity of <strong><a href=\"https://dejabuwines.co.uk/online-shop/domaine-chevrot-bourgogne-aligote-quatre-terroirs-2018\">Cuv\u00e9e des Quatre Terroirs 2018</a></strong> (12%) from Domaine Chevrot \u2013 although, at \u00a318.99, it is not inexpensive. The Ch\u00e2teau de Rougeon in today\u2019s panel, however, is well worth a whirl, particularly if you can find some wine-loving neighbours to pitch in with you.</p> <p>If you are into this kind of ultra-dry white, which perfectly suits lighter, summery food, you are spoilt for choice. France also offers muscadel and picpoul, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/may/19/albarino-the-iberian-peninsulars-greatest-white-grape-spreads-its-wings\">Spain albari\u00f1o</a> (alvarinho in Portugal) and Austria peppery gr\u00fcner veltliner, which goes with practically anything. Italy is awash with good-value whites, including (and perhaps unexpectedly) those from the warmer south of the country, such as falanghina, greco di tufo and Sicily\u2019s carricante.

  "<p>An hour before the first episode of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race season three aired on US cable network Logo TV, Raja turned up for her gig at Micky\u2019s, a popular gay bar in West Hollywood. Months had passed since filming had finished on the series, and despite knowing she was the winner, baby, little else in her life had changed.&nbsp;</p> <p>It was January 2011, and the US reality competition was still very much in its infancy. While today (global pandemics aside) queens are booked up for a whirlwind of international tours as soon as their casting on the show is announced \u2013 global rights deals giving the cultural phenomena a vast and lucrative international audience \u2013 back then, things were more low key. She might have pocketed $75,000 in prize money, but after filming finished, Raja went back to working as a makeup artist, doing drag on the side as before.&nbsp;</p> <p>Having been booked to perform at a screening of the season premier at Micky\u2019s, she arrived unsure of what to expect by way of a reception. \u201cI came on in my entrance outfit \u2013 a black catsuit with an eyeball hat \u2013 and nobody gave a flying fuck,\u201d she says.</p> <p>It was only after her victory was announced (the news was leaked online by Perez Hilton) that the phone started ringing. The 10-stop tour of US cities that followed was like nothing she had experienced. Seeing a queue around the block waiting for her to perform in New York gave her an inkling of what was to come. A few months later she was booked up for shows and appearances for over a year in advance.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"617de413e4f8088c8a85c14826c3a185d068d15b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/617de413e4f8088c8a85c14826c3a185d068d15b/0_0_2632_1579/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drag Race\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">They\u2019re winners, baby (from left): Sharon Needles, Raja and Bianca Del Rio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Broadimage/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cStill,\u201d Raja says, \u201cif you see what the girls appearing on the show now are making compared to what we made at that time, it\u2019s a dramatic change. They can charge $6,000 to $10,000 for an appearance. But for us it was new ground; we were able to have fun without the same pressures.\u201d</p> <p>By the time Sasha Velour took the top spot in 2017\u2019s season 9, things had escalated. The first season to be aired on VH1, Drag Race \u2013 and the industry it helped to create \u2013 was booming. As soon as the year\u2019s cast was announced, Sasha said goodbye to selling her merchandise from the back of her minivan. Her regular show upsized to a venue with 10 times the capacity she had been working to before and she had bookings to perform around the world. \u201cThe opportunities and the audience,\u201d she says, \u201cthe sheer number of people who knew about what I was doing \u2013 changed overnight.\u201d</p> <p>Post-Perez, even the finalists were kept in the dark about who the winner would be until the last minute. Sasha watched her victory be announced live on TV from a New York hotel with the rest of the cast before being rushed to her crowning at a club round the corner.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cNot to sound like Lady Gaga,\u201d she says, \u201cbut from then it was another plane, next gig, take a bus. It was another four months before things stopped for a while and there was time to think about what might come next.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30ddb6464733f58135715f486add125af0b943b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30ddb6464733f58135715f486add125af0b943b3/0_296_5226_3136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alaska\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alaska remember her time after Drag Race as a \u2018crazy, party train wreck\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ole Jensen/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What struck Sasha as time went on was how much the skills she had honed before her time on the show prepared her for everything that came after. Winning the show came with a $100,000 prize and unrivalled exposure, but she still designed her own work; her partner \u2013 Johnny \u2013 continued as stage manager. \u201cThe smoke and mirrors of it all makes it look like a big glow up that comes with the opportunity,\u201d she says, \u201cbut actually all that shifts are the number of opportunities for you to take. There\u2019s no infrastructure there to help you.\u201d Yet, she says, </p> <p>\u201cnon-stop touring is the dream of any drag artist, getting to both perform and see drag scenes around the world in queer spaces\u201d and it broadened her understanding of drag.</p> <p>Alaska Thunderfuck remembers that time pretty well, although, if she is honest, it\u2019s all a little hazy. A runner-up on season 5, and the winner of All Stars 2 (where queens return for another shot at the crown), she describes what happened after her appearances as \u201ca crazy party train wreck\u201d.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>As soon as the cast was announced I was making more money than I ever had doing drag,\u201d she says from Los Angeles, \u201cand there\u2019s a lot that comes with that. My relationship with Sharon [Needles, winner of season 4] went to shit, suddenly everywhere you go the answer is yes: free drinks? drugs? boys? All of a sudden, every door is open, and we didn\u2019t have the tools or discipline, so we went in all those doors.\u201d</p> <p>Before winning Drag Race season 5 in 2013, Jinkx\u2019s Monsoon\u2019s career in Seattle had hit its stride: regular shows were supplemented by theatre work and a part-time janitor gig. \u201cImportantly, though, drag was always something I did with my tribe,\u201d the 32-year-old explains from Portland, Oregon. \u201cI went from being part of a community and performing with friends to being guest star in a different city every night.\u201d It quickly became a lonely experience, disconnected from the things that had made doing drag fun. &nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cAfter winning came two years of putting an insane amount of pressure on myself every time I had to perform, which drove me crazy,\u201d says Jinkx. \u201cI felt I had to hit this high standard for myself every time. I lost touch with what I found exciting about drag in the first place and went into a depression.\u201d</p> <p>Jinkx has spoken to every previous winner about the experience of clinching the crown, and believes each has grappled with similar emotions. And, in Jinkx\u2019s eyes, those feelings are heightened if you are presented as the underdog who succeeds against the odds. You go from being supported as the relatable weirdo to queen bee.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI feel like the drag race fanbase turned on me after I won,\u201d Jinkx says. Some said winning had changed Jinkx; others that they weren\u2019t good enough to have taken the top spot in the first place. \u201cAll the attention was on me, and it felt like none of it was positive. It could well be only three people in the world were actually talking about me that way, but that\u2019s somehow what I saw.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e98af5a011bba6681a36765aa14554411d923989\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e98af5a011bba6681a36765aa14554411d923989/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bob\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019ve always been a very political person\u2019: Bob the Drag Queen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Fewings/Getty Images for World Of Wonder Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the status of the show has rapidly increased, so too have the opportunities available to its winners.

That\u2019s a major challenge facing the queens of season 12, say all these winners: putting on a show is what drag queens do best. And with another series of All Stars starting to air in June, they will have to find innovative ways to stay relevant in an increasingly saturated market.</p> <p>Sasha hopes this won\u2019t hurt this crop\u2019s prospects too much: she didn\u2019t release her first solo show until 18 months after winning.
