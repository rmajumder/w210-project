  "<p>UK Athletics allowed Mo Farah to remain with Alberto Salazar in 2015 despite some board members feeling \u201cblackmailed\u201d by the performance director, Neil Black, and other coaching staff, an independent report into the Salazar scandal has revealed.</p> <p>Black told his board at the time that he \u201cgreatly admired\u201d Salazar and had seen no evidence to support allegations made by a damning Panorama programme that Farah\u2019s coach had broken anti-doping rules with his Nike Oregon Project training group. He also warned that severing the relationship with the American, who guided Farah to four Olympic gold medals, would hit medal targets set by UK Sport.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/19/mo-farah-taking-supplement-l-carnitine-london-marathon-2014\">'I genuinely forgot': Mo Farah explains changing story over taking supplement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However a 130-page report by the leading sports barrister John Mehrzad, which reviewed UK Athletics\u2019 dealings with Salazar, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/01/athletics-coach-alberto-salazar-receives-four-year-ban-for-doping-violations\" title=\"\">who received a four-year doping ban in October</a>, says some board members were uneasy with the comments of Black and Barry Fudge, the head of endurance.</p> <p>\u201cBlack said he had not seen and was not aware of any wrongdoing concerning the NOP and Farah,\u201d the report states. \u201cHe also greatly admired Salazar and had not personally seen any evidence to support the allegations levelled against Salazar by the Panorama programme.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed, so strongly did Black and Fudge feel about the issue, they indicated that their positions would be \u2018untenable\u2019 if there was a knee-jerk severing of the relationship with Salazar by the board.</p> <p>\u201cHaving then been informed of that position, some on the then UKA board felt the stance taken by those individuals was \u2018in effect blackmail\u2019. However, those performance figures deny that to have been the case. Rather, they believed their position to be very straightforward: their ability to deliver against medal targets set by UK Sport would be hampered if Farah was forced against his will to split from Salazar.\u201d</p> <p>Black left UKA after the world championships in October, while Fudge is still in post. Salazar, who guided Farah to four Olympic and five world titles between 2011 and 2017, has said he will appeal against the ban and no NOP athlete, including Farah, has been found to have taken a banned substance.</p> <p>Mehrzad\u2019s report also concludes that a heavily criticised 2015 UKA internal review, which concluded it had \u201cno concerns\u201d about allowing Farah continue to be coached by Salazar, was reasonable. The report says in future such reviews should be led by those outside the organisation; UKA\u2019s performance oversight committee was restricted by UK Anti-Doping not allowing it to consider any doping-related allegations made by Panorama.</p> <p>Mehrzad also found \u201cno documentary evidence\u201d that Nike had influenced or sought to influence the board\u2019s decision about Salazar and his Nike Oregon training group.</p> <p>However he says the governing body\u2019s handling of the scandal \u201ccould have been better\u201d \u2013 and is particularly critical of the failure of the UKA board to keep proper records, including minutes taken of a special board meeting to discuss the Salazar case in 2015.</p> <p>Among Mehrzad\u2019s recommendations is UKA should review its coaching code of conduct and ensure reviews are conducted by independent experts. \u201cOf course, any organisation is entitled to manage itself but the carrying out of a review process \u2018in-house\u2019 may lead to accusations of a lack of real independence,\u201d the report states.</p> <p>\u201cThat perception, however misplaced, cannot be truly alleviated unless a review is carried out, in whole or in part, by an external person or body who has no role or function with the UKA.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a press release issued on Friday, UKA said it would implement all recommendations made in the report.

Plus my actual pay, which is only $3 an hour. I was supposed to come in for my next shift, but I was told not to come in. It\u2019s not worth us coming in, they said, and if I needed money, I should file for unemployment.</p> <p>My husband gets paid $15 an hour, and after taxes, usually makes like around $600 a week working 10-hour shifts. Both the kitchen chefs from his job texted him and let him know that they\u2019d be closing down the restaurant. They were very sad and wished everyone the best luck during these hard times, and told him to look for his last paycheck in the mail. It\u2019ll be the last one we\u2019re getting.</p> <p>We\u2019ve both been working very hard and we have a little bit of money saved up, so we\u2019re hoping it\u2019ll get us through this hard time. We\u2019re staying inside. My daughters haven\u2019t seen sunlight outside since Friday afternoon. The most important thing right now is that we\u2019re able to provide for them. They go to public school and they\u2019re actually offering free breakfast, free lunch. So every morning at around nine, I make my way over and they give me breakfast and lunch to bring back.

We got into the office Monday and heard our production, which is big budget, was \u201cpushed\u201d. I work in the office, so technically we could work from home because it\u2019s a lot of paperwork. But we were supposed to start shooting at the end of the month. That\u2019s 200 crew members on set, and certainly they can\u2019t work from home. My boss told me for us that means we\u2019d have to stop work immediately, get paid through two weeks, and then that\u2019s it.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been working on productions for two and a half years, and in between gigs, my fallback is usually restaurant work. But that\u2019s not going to happen. I can always babysit. But even that right now is dubious. I\u2019m going to have to register for unemployment. I\u2019m on an email chain with a lot of people that work in gig economy jobs, so I\u2019m on that now finding out what more I can do. I know I can survive for a couple of months, paying rent and my bills.</p> <p>We\u2019re meant to go back to work in six to eight weeks if the city is up and running. And if it stays bad until the summer, I wouldn\u2019t re-sign my lease in August and I guess I\u2019d have to move back in with my parents.</p> <h2>Armen Agaian, 23<br>Ice performer, after-school figure skating coach</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"398f3241e253ae4901810853abb553a950827e61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/398f3241e253ae4901810853abb553a950827e61/0_0_3751_5001/750.jpg\" alt=\"Armen Agaian poses for a portrait in his yard in Queens, N.Y.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><br>I\u2019ve been in the US since 2017. I came from Georgia, where I was a national figure skating champion. I perform in the Ice Theater show and we do school programs after the show, and I do a lot of private lessons. Last week, the show and all the school programs started shutting down. Then at the beginning of this week, my manager texted us, no one\u2019s going on the ice. The rinks where I teach shut down, of course. I can\u2019t tell if we can get paid.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have enough to pay my rent this month.

I stay in touch with my private students and give them work to do at home to stay motivated. But it\u2019s hard. Every single muscle feels different when you\u2019re on the ice. It\u2019s hard for me to work out properly, too. I have a solo program coming up and have to be able to do triple jumps. I have enough to pay my rent this month. After that, I don\u2019t know.

I\u2019m a mixologist, which is like cooking in front of an audience, sometimes using eight or 10 ingredients for a cocktail. I\u2019ve been in this industry since I was 21, and it\u2019s the best bar/restaurant I\u2019ve ever worked in. It\u2019s been my full-time job. I work four nights a week, eight to 10 hours a night. The owner\u2019s really hands-on. She and I have been having an ongoing conversation about it and Sunday, we ultimately decided that closing was the right thing to do. Right after we decided, the governor put out the mandate saying we all had to close anyway.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve been trying to file for unemployment since Monday.

But even though I worked last week, I would say I had an 80% income drop. Which is scary to think that even if we can reopen, I won\u2019t have anything set aside for when things usually slow down in summer. I\u2019ve been trying to file for unemployment since Monday. The website just keeps crashing. Looks like there may be a little bit of outside help.</p> <p>A bartender association opened up to non-member bartenders to be able to apply for some relief, and Jameson\u2019s just donated $500,000 to that fund, which is lovely of them. Also I read that the mayor announced they\u2019re going to put a hold on people getting evicted due to lack of payment in the next couple of months, and I believe the same with utilities, which makes me feel safer knowing that.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never not paid my rent and utility bill \u2013 even when I lived below the poverty line as a professional dancer. But then there\u2019s just this, in New York City, the bar is a community gathering place. It\u2019s where you go when you\u2019re bored. It\u2019s where you go when you want to celebrate. It\u2019s where you go when you\u2019re sad. It\u2019s just where you go.

I just had a conference call about how to cue clients during virtual sessions, you know, to get a client to achieve a specific movement. That was good insight, very effective. It helps knowing we\u2019re going to be able to provide the some quality of service for clients online.</p> <p>As far as being compensated, the company\u2019s taking the average of our two pay periods for February, and they say that\u2019s what they\u2019ll be giving us for however long this thing lasts. So that helps. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s going to solve everything. I\u2019m going to have to hustle for more clients. But while I will still be working hard to keep my side business with private clients, what I get from the gym is going to help me stay afloat. You know, we\u2019re all going to see how long this thing goes and try to stretch things to make it work as long as it lasts.</p>",
  "<p>Welfare recipients will have their mutual obligations relaxed during the coronavirus crisis, but the government has stopped short of heeding calls from Labor, the Greens and social service groups to suspend them entirely.</p> <p>Facing growing pressure to ease the burden amid a looming economic downturn and increasingly strict social-distancing guidelines, the employment minister, Michaelia Cash, said on Friday the government had adopted a range of measures aimed at making the system more flexible during the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> <p>These included allowing jobseekers to ask that appointments with employment services providers be conducted online or by phone, and a significant reduction in job search requirements, from a maximum of 20 applications to four per month.</p> <p>Work for the dole and other group activities that cannot be undertaken online will be suspended.</p> <p>Cash said the government would keep mutual obligations in place as long as it was in line with official health advice. </p> <p>\u201cThese changes prioritise the welfare of jobseekers but will also help keep those out of work actively engaged and supported to take up critical jobs in demand now, and when the economy recovers,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Labor, the Greens and organisations including the Australian Council of Social Service and Australian Unemployed Workers Union want a blanket suspension of mutual obligations, which also would ensure welfare recipients did not have their payments cut.</p> <p>But the government is maintaining a tough posture on welfare compliance, warning that jobseekers who do not attend job interviews or take up work when offered would face penalties.</p> <p>The UK, known for its harsh benefits system, was set to suspend its mutual obligations requirements for jobseekers on Friday.
