  "<p>Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 24 March.</p> \n<h2>Coronavirus</h2> \n<p><strong>The national cabinet will today consider</strong><strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/national-cabinet-to-consider-lockdowns-for-coronavirus-hotspots-and-help-for-renters\">locking down coronavirus hotspots</a></strong>, as well as new financial assistance measures for renters, and further shutdowns of non-essential services. That financial assistance could be vital for many, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/23/job-losses-from-australias-coronavirus-shutdown-will-be-devastating\">with job losses from coronavirus set to increase rapidly</a>. Rapid testing kits have now been approved by Australian regulators that will allow doctors to screen patients for the virus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/24/rapid-covid-19-testing-kits-receive-urgent-approval-from-australian-regulator\">within 15 minutes at clinics and hospitals</a>. And <strong>Naaman Zhou</strong> asks how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/anatomy-of-a-coronavirus-disaster-how-2700-people-were-let-off-the-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-by-mistake\">48 people who have now tested positive for Covid-19</a> were allowed to disembark from the Ruby Princess cruise ship in Sydney on Sunday. </p> \n<p><strong>New South Wales Catholic schools have appealed for government help in setting up online teaching resources and have warned of a digital divide between schools.</strong> \u201cThe capacity of schools, families and communities to make any such transition is not consistent across NSW, and expectations must be realistic,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/24/clear-as-mud-schools-ask-for-online-learning-help-as-coronavirus-policy-confusion-persists\">said chief executive of Catholic Schools NSW, Dallas McInerney</a>. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/kiwis-go-home-new-zealand-to-go-into-month-long-lockdown-to-fight-coronavirus\">prime minister Jacinda Ardern has placed the entire country in lockdown from Wednesday</a>. </p> \n<p><strong>The death toll from coronavirus has now surpassed 15,000 people, and there are more than 350,000 confirmed cases worldwide. </strong>Despite this, Donald Trump has signalled that he may allow life to return to normal after a 15-day period of physical distancing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/trump-social-distancing-coronavirus-rules-guidelines-economy\">\u201cWe cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself. At the end of the 15-day period\u201d</a>, he tweeted.</p> \n<p><strong>Disgraced movie producer and convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein has tested positive for coronavirus. </strong>The 68-year-old American has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/harvey-weinstein-tests-positive-for-coronavirus\">placed in isolation at Wende correctional facility in New York state.</a> Brazil\u2019s authoritarian president Jair Bolsonaro has taken a similar stance to Trump, describing Covid-19 as a media trick. He has refused to bring in strong measurers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/brazils-jair-bolsonaro-says-coronavirus-crisis-is-a-media-trick\">to stop the the virus\u2019s spread</a>. </p> \n<p>Across the Atlantic, <strong>Boris Johnson </strong><strong>is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/pressure-grows-boris-johnson-impose-uk-coronavirus-lockdown\">facing calls</a> to impose a stricter lockdown in the UK. </strong>\u201cIn these extraordinary times, the government must now set out further compliance measures, such as those introduced in other countries,\u201d said Labour leadership front-runner Keir Starmer. As Giles Tremlett writes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/europe-views-uk-coronavirus-plan-disbelief\">the rest of Europe views the UK\u2019s plans with disbelief</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>The situation in Spain is still grave with another 462 people dying on Monday. </strong>The country has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/spain-distributes-650000-testing-kits-as-coronavirus-deaths-rise-steeply\">rushed out 650,000 rapid testing kits</a> for frontline hospital staff, older people in care homes, and those in regions most affected by the virus. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/23/spanish-police-sing-to-families-in-lockdown-in-mallorca-video\">Spanish police have been filmed singing in Mallorca</a> to raise spirits during lockdown. In Italy, there is outrage at people who are ignoring lockdown orders. A compilation video of Italian mayors berating citizens for flouting the rules has struck a chord in the beleaguered country. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/this-is-not-a-film-italian-mayors-rage-coronavirus-lockdown-dodgers\">More than 90,000 people have been charged for breaking regulations since the lockdown was enforced</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>The IMF has warned that the global recession from Covid-19 could be worse than the global financial crisis in 2008. </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/23/markets-slump-us-senate-covid-19-ftse-dax-shares-recession-stimulus-business-live\">IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva issued the warning</a>, following a conference call with G20 finance ministers and central bank governors today. Diplomatic clashes between China and the US over responsibility for the coronavirus pandemic and which of the countries will emerge from it stronger , <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/g20-finance-ministers-talks-hampered-by-us-china-posturing-coronavirus\">have stalled talks between finance ministers of the G20</a>. Restrictions on Chinese citizens have now eased, as health authorities have reported only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/life-after-lockdown-has-china-really-beaten-coronavirus\">one new locally transmitted case of Covid-19 in the last five days</a>. But as the country returns to work, residents and analysts doubt the near-zero community transmission rate, worrying that leaders have prioritised restarting the economy over decisively containing the virus.</p> \n<h2>Australia</h2> \n<p><strong>Power baron Trevor St Baker\u2019s push to get funds from a government climate change initiative to upgrade a coal plant has failed. </strong>Owners Sunset Power International, trading as Delta Electricity, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/24/push-to-get-taxpayer-funds-for-vales-point-coal-plant-upgrade-rejected\">wanted </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/24/push-to-get-taxpayer-funds-for-vales-point-coal-plant-upgrade-rejected\"> taxpayers\u2019 support to help pay for a $14m project to replace turbine blades</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Virgin Australia has written to the competition watchdog complaining about allegedly anti-competitive attacks by Qantas boss Alan Joyce. </strong>In the past few days Joyce has made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/23/virgin-australia-qantas-accc-investigate-campaign-competition\">several statements critical of Virgin\u2019s management and ownership.</a></p> \n<p><strong>A Guardian Essential Poll released today reveals that one third of Australians think there has been an overreaction to the coronavirus. </strong>The latest survey of 1,034 respondents suggests men, and voters aged under 34, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/24/guardian-essential-poll-one-third-say-there-has-been-an-overreaction-to-coronavirus\">are more likely to think there has been an overreaction</a> than voters over 55, and women.</p> \n<h2>The world</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1866df3c3331571bc4b03b137fd4bb6179421e55\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1866df3c3331571bc4b03b137fd4bb6179421e55/0_66_2820_1693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US marines at Toor Ghar in the Helmand province of Afghanistan.

  "<p>The coronavirus is about to destroy the scale of economic data. What we was considered a \u201cbad case\u201d scenario or even indicative of times requiring stimulus no longer even computes. So quickly are things turning we almost need a new language to explain it.</p> <p>One of the most common aphorisms among those dealing with data is that \u201cthe trend is your friend\u201d. It is a nice way to note that generally when you see data \u2013 such as the unemployment rate \u2013 jumping around, the trend, which is essentially an averaged representation of the data, helps you see through the noise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Unemployed in Australia - monthly change\">  <iframe title=\"Unemployed in Australia - monthly change \" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JwfdD/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But occasionally something happens that breaks the trend \u2013 such as the boost in retail spending that occurred during the GFC as a result of the stimulus payments:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Retail trade turnover: September 2007-August 2009\">  <iframe title=\"Retail trade turnover: September 2007-August 2009\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nvtcS/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2020/mar/19/the-only-thing-we-can-say-with-certainty-is-that-the-fallout-from-coronavirus-is-going-to-be-brutal\">The only thing we can say with certainty is that the fallout from coronavirus is going to be brutal | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The spending was so out of sync with previous levels the trend no longer made sense and the Bureau of Statistics even stopped calculating the trend rate for nine months until normalcy returned.</p> <p>So that was what happened to some data during the GFC.</p> <p>But that is not what we are about to experience.

Schools are closed, shops and places of business are shut.</p> <p>As a result there has been a wave of people claiming unemployment insurance this week.</p> <p>And by wave, I mean a tsunami.</p> <p>Over the past three months, an average of 49,000 people in California applied for the first time for unemployment insurance (known as \u201cinitial claims\u201d, as opposed to ongoing ones by people already unemployed).</p> <p>During the GFC, in the last week of January 2009, 95,000 new people applied; a year later, in the second week of January 2010, 115,462 applied \u2013 so more than double what you would expect during good times.</p> <p>Based on the numbers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABC7Jory/status/1241522459905421312\">already announced</a>, former senior economist for labor at the US President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, Aaron Sojourner, has estimated in the past week 639,200 people in California will make an initial claim for unemployment insurance:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Weekly initial unemployment claims - California\">  <iframe title=\"Weekly initial unemployment claims - California\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qZ0gh/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>That is breaking the scale.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2020/mar/22/with-the-coronavirus-heres-whats-really-going-to-matter-for-the-australian-economy\">With the coronavirus, here's what's really going to matter for the Australian economy | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And California is not an exception.

But not only is it a sign of what is coming, it also highlights the absurdity of the actual term.</p> <p>To be unemployed is to be \u201cactively looking for work\u201d. But just what work is there to look for right now? Not only are businesses not hiring, many are being forced to not operate. Around 10% of job vacancies each month are for retail trade and 7% are for accommodation and food services, and another 1.5% for arts and recreation. None of these industries is hiring \u2013 other than a few supermarkets looking for some extra staff to help pack shelves.</p> <p>Currently the government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/20/centrelink-continues-to-chase-welfare-clients-for-robodebts-despite-coronavirus\">kept some mutual obligations in place</a>, but it is pretty obvious things have changed and changed drastically. Actively looking for work? Nope. Unemployed? Most definitely.</p> <p>The scale has been broken, and so too have the definitions.</p> <ul> <li><p>Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia<br></p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>After a bumpy start, this year\u2019s Drag Race is swiftly proving to be a divisive season. And you know what, I love it. Viewers may claim to hate divisiveness and controversy, but much like Peter Andre circa 2004, Blake Lively\u2019s hair, Kit-Kat Chunkies, Rishi Sunak, and kebab flavoured crisps (available at obscure Turkish corner shops everywhere) we all secretly crave it.

They really are going to show it every single episode. For a loooooong time. Is this a good idea? Will the show suffer if viewers are constantly reminded it was fairly heavily built around a contestant with the moral capacity of a stockpiling stoat? Side bar: We have it on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/race-chaser-with-alaska-willam/id1408740329\">good authority</a> that the show has in fact done a swift re-edit of this season to bury the Pie (is that a euphemism? It sounds like one. If it wasn\u2019t before, it is now). Sherry only appeared in the interview room clips ONCE in episode three, and yet won the main challenge. Wild!</p> <p>Jaida touches on \u201cmixed emotions\u201d while simultaneously looking utterly, confidently emotionless.

The producers have got those fridge magnets out again!</p> <p>This is great though. They\u2019ve clearly clocked that the best bit of the show by far is the runway. Also interesting that the third look has to be designed and built from scratch. Like the good old days! We can\u2019t wait for Heidi\u2019s. Gigi is worried that Nicky \u201chas her concept together\u201d. That\u2019s the thing with concepts, Gigi! They have a nasty habit of coming together! Brita also has a concept, but doesn\u2019t know how to bring it together. Concepts, concepts, concepts.</p> <p>Rock M Sakura performs an incredible cosplay trick, crafting a cast of her body from duct tape, which she then uses as the base of her outfit. Brita says she\u2019s \u201cconcerned\u201d and that it looks like \u201ca science fair project gone wrong\u201d. Well Brita, YOUR outfit is currently a giant inflatable yellow ball and nothing else, so you can shut up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RuPaulsDragRace/status/1241159442923696128\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RockMSakura?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RockMSakura</a> baby what is you doing?! \ud83e\udd2d<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DragRace?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DragRace</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/1pcOLnM3VS\">pic.twitter.com/1pcOLnM3VS</a></p>&mdash; RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race (@RuPaulsDragRace) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RuPaulsDragRace/status/1241159442923696128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 21, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Despite some shady edits and quick asides, the ladies are mostly having a laugh and getting on well in the workroom. Positive energy and solidarity. You love to see it! Jaida says \u201cnormally I\u2019m not the type to be running around playing with white balls\u201d. Oh Jaida.</p> <h2>Sissy That Walk</h2> <p>We\u2019re on the runway and Ru stalks in with a glissade of Quality Street gorgeousness, hair scraped back into a BEEhive \u2013 absolutely stunning, perhaps her best look of this season. Leslie Jones is EXHAUSTING already but it\u2019s brilliant. She\u2019s filming on her phone, she\u2019s singing, she\u2019s mouthing along to the catchphrases. It\u2019s like they\u2019ve invited one of us on to score. It\u2019s great when the judges give 50,000%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Lesdoggg/status/1241171747858198528\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Omg omg omg omg I\u2019m so gagging it was the best thing I\u2019ve ever done!!

Lady Gaga\u2019s Superbowl Halftime Show has definitely had a heavy influence here. Rock\u2019s tetherball wig is genius and UNIQUE. Jaida, as always, is drop dead stunning \u2013 her energy on the runway is spellbinding. Jan has chopped up loads of footballs and made them into a suit and the result is gorge.</p> <p>Next up; Basketball Wife. Nicki Doll is looking distinctly Gossip Girl mum and we\u2019re obsessed. Rock is transformed in a more stereotypically sexy but much more generic drag look \u2013 this is good though, Michelle will be pleased and it will keep her safe. We must protect Rock M Sakura at all costs! Gigi positively slithers down the runway looking 10/10 stunning. Obsessed.</p> <p>Lastly, Balls To The Wall Eleganza, hand-crafted by the girls rather than pre-bought. Aiden\u2019s look is dreadful. So is Brita\u2019s. In fact, none of them are AMAZING. Crystal and Jackie\u2019s are probably the best. And Gigi is the overall winner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/loveeharling/status/1241304045769207808\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Gigi Goode served eleganza in that  runway in the main stage and she freaking deserves that win \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 ,,, don&#39;t try me <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DragRace?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DragRace</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/XLHp5b06cy\">pic.twitter.com/XLHp5b06cy</a></p>&mdash; jed\u03b9ee (@loveeharling) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/loveeharling/status/1241304045769207808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 21, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>Lipsync for your LIFE</h2> <p>Rock and Brita are up for elimination and Aiden is safe.
