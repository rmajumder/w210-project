  "<p>Some are born lucky, some achieve luckiness and others have luckiness thrust upon them. It\u2019s not yet clear into which category Rishi Sunak might fall, but it\u2019s looking entirely possible that the chancellor qualifies for all three. A hat-trick for which every chancellor in history would have sold their souls has landed gently in his lap.</p> <p>When Sunak became chancellor last month, he was widely written off as Boris Johnson\u2019s poodle. The man who would happily sack all his special advisers and follow his master\u2019s every word just to get his hands on one of the four main offices of state. How things change. Now it\u2019s Rishi who looks the master and Boris the needy lapdog. Where Boris frequently looks a bit shifty, uncertain of the facts and prone to contradiction at the daily Downing Street press conference, Sunak was totally assured as he outlined his aid package for the self-employed. A prime minister in waiting \u2013 and probably not for very long.</p> <p>The coronavirus has been devastating for the country on almost every level. But for Sunak it has had one or two unexpected dividends. For every Conservative chancellor in history, the onus has been on prudence, balancing the books, low spending, low tax fiscal responsibility and \u2013 where possible \u2013 giving a little bit more to the most well-off members of society.</p> <p>But now the gloves are off. Sunak already had been given a bit of leeway to loosen the purse strings to prove Brexit a success, but now he has free licence to spend, spend, spend in a bid both to save the economy and protect people\u2019s jobs. There is now a bottomless pit of money from which he could give a commitment to spend as much as was needed to see the country through the coronavirus pandemic. If you\u2019re in trouble, Rishi\u2019s your man. It can\u2019t be long before he does a Jimmy McGill and changes his name to Saul Goodman.</p> <p>It goes without saying that if it had been a Labour chancellor who had been promising what could well be a \u00a3500bn bailout, then many Tory MPs would have been up in arms about the Marxist economics of mass state aid. Crisis or no crisis. But now the Tories believe in an Interventionist God. Or at least an Interventionist Chancellor, so because Sunak is one of them he gets a free pass.</p> <p>Better still, there are no downsides. He is a man of consequence who is blissfully free of consequences. Should the economy go into recession, then he can legitimately plead humanitarian priorities. And if Brexit should later go tits up, he can blame the coronavirus. It\u2019s win-win. Where most chancellors are forced into the role of Scrooge, telling people why it\u2019s good for their souls to be broke, Sunak is able to be the man on the street corner handing out free money. Providing you don\u2019t look too hard at the small print.</p> <p>Having already provided a bailout package for workers on PAYE, Rishi was now turning his attention to the self-employed. We must forget ideology, he said as a warning shot to those Tory MPs who have an inbuilt aversion to anyone without the resources to look after themselves, and do the right thing. And the right thing to do was to offer all those with three years of accounts and earnings up to \u00a350k per year a monthly payout of up to \u00a32,500. With the option to extend if the coronavirus lockdown lasted longer than expected.</p> <p>There were a few hiccups in the system of course. As there were in the video-link with the media. \u201cWe turn next to Robert Peston of ITV,\u201d said Rishi.</p> <p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d said Peston.</p> <p>\u201cAfternoon, Robert.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm ... My connection isn\u2019t very stable, but I will give it a go.\u201d</p> <p>The questions mainly centred on those who fell through the self-employed net. Those who might only just have turned self-employed or didn\u2019t have more than a year or two of self-assessment accounts and didn\u2019t have the cash flow to wait for the \u00a37,500 payout in June would be able to get emergency handouts from universal credit (UC).</p> <p>Here Sunak\u2019s age counted against him. He may be only 18 but he looks younger and clearly hasn\u2019t yet discovered that universal credit hasn\u2019t been a universal success. At the last count more than 500,000 people on PAYE had tried to access UC in the last 10 days. A further 3.5 million people logging in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/universal-credit-claims-almost-impossible-as-more-than-500000-apply\" title=\"\">could break the system entirely</a>. \u201cYou are currently number 3,289,688 in the queue. Your current estimated waiting time is seven years, nine months and 21 days. Please do hold as your call is important to us though we will do our best to time you out before you have spoken to the grandchild of the person who was originally answering the phone when you first rang.\u201d</p> <p>The thing was, Rishi did this all with complete panache. He is a man untroubled by lack of self-confidence. He even managed to get away with threatening the self-employed with a massive hike in tax and national insurance contributions as a quid pro quo for his largesse, without offering them paid holiday or statutory sick pay in return. Because he was the King of Cool, the last of the big spenders who would see most people near enough alright.</p> <p>As he left the podium, he eyed up the Downing Street state rooms. One day soon, all this would be his.</p>",
  "<p>New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, excoriated Congress on Thursday for failing to provide much-needed aid to his state as it battles a soaring number of fatalities and a continuing scramble for medical supplies.</p> \n<p>The $2tn coronavirus stimulus package that passed the Senate late on Wednesday woefully neglects New York, according to Cuomo, who said it allocated $5bn in aid to the state, earmarked only for Covid-19 expenses. The funds do nothing to address the $10bn-$15bn in lost revenue New York expects to incur because of the crisis, Cuomo said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a7492be8-19c7-4303-9d39-82fe538488ad\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QOnXQKx3yRs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThis was the time to put politics aside and partisanship aside,\u201d Cuomo said during a press briefing. \u201cThis is the time for governmental leaders to stop making excuses and just do your job. Do your job.\u201d</p> \n<p>He was not alone.</p> \n<p>New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, on Wednesday expressed alarm at the fact that the city has only been promised $1bn in aid through the same bill, even though it accounts for almost a third of coronavirus cases nationwide. He blamed the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, for the financially crippling oversight.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how anybody \u2013 any public servant \u2013 could live with themselves if they deprived the cities in the middle of the biggest crisis since the Great Depression \u2013 deprived us, deprived our state \u2013 of the money we need,\u201d De Blasio said.</p> \n<p>The bill is the latest battleground between New York officials and the federal government; De Blasio and Cuomo have continually challenged the Trump administration and Congress to do more for their constituents. The contest over funding comes as New York sees an increase in confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths, and as the state stares down a devastating lack of medical resources that could put lives at risk.</p> \n<p>New York City reported 280 deaths by Wednesday evening, a leap from 199 deaths tallied earlier in the day, as hospitals were overwhelmed by a \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Craig_A_Spencer/status/1242302403338219520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1242302403338219520&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2020%2Fmar%2F25%2Fits-all-covid-new-york-medical-staff-brace-for-a-surge-of-coronavirus-patients\">cacophony of coughing</a>\u201d from Covid-19 cases.

It\u2019s bad news because people are dying, and that\u2019s the worst news you can have,\u201d Cuomo said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4a4ca489-feee-429c-ab1f-5674dfd089a0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qEtxAfKd0sI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He attributed the rise in fatalities to people who have been on ventilators for long periods of time and never recovered, and he said there were patients who have now been on ventilators for 20 to 30 days.</p> \n<p>These lifesaving machines that patients with the most severe Covid-19 symptoms rely on have been a stressor for New York, and on Thursday, Cuomo explained why. Not only is there a tremendous dearth \u2013 New York hospitals had only 4,000 ventilators in the system at the beginning of the outbreak and will need 30,000 \u2013 but Covid-19 patients need ventilators for 11 to 21 days on average, so turnarounds are slow.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/25/new-york-andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-cases\">New York: Cuomo says early signs show coronavirus distancing may be working</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>To try to manage need, one Manhattan hospital has already started sharing ventilators between two patients who require similar ventilator settings, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html\">according to the New York Times</a>.</p> \n<p>Still, Trump dismissed these realities. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators,\u201d he said in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity on Thursday night.</p> \n<p>While hospitals experience a tidal wave of Covid-19 patients, they have been mandated to increase their capacity. Under normal circumstances the state only supports 53,000 hospital beds and 3,000 intensive care unit beds, and hospitals are scrambling to supply the 140,000 beds and 40,000 ICU beds that they are projected to need once the outbreak reaches its apex.</p> \n<p>As Cuomo implores hospitals to exponentially increase their capacity, 40,000 healthcare workers have volunteered with the state\u2019s surge healthcare force to address the pandemic, including students and retirees.</p> \n<p>Addressing reports of severe supply shortages already at Elmhurst hospital in Queens, De Blasio said he had already resupplied the hospital with additional ventilators four times in the past 10 days and today sent over 40 additional ventilators. \u201cIf we have it, it will get to you,\u201d he said at a press conference on Thursday.</p> \n<p>Before the coronavirus outbreak, New York City had 20,000 hospital beds; De Blasio said he hopes to triple the system\u2019s capacity to 60,000 beds by May. De Blasio said New York was showing the nation how to deal with a crisis. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a helluva challenge, these weeks ahead. But there\u2019s nowhere on earth where people meet a challenge like New York City.\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, New York\u2019s attorney general, Letitia James, addressed yet another health crisis and dangerous byproduct of the virus: persecution targeting Asian Americans. James created a hotline to report hate crimes and discrimination earlier this week after people started to describe aggressive, racist behavior <a href=\"https://twitter.com/originalspin/status/1242202878707560448\">perpetrated against them in the name of the virus</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo one should live in fear for their life because of who they are, what they look like, or where they come from,\u201d James said in a statement.</p>",
  "<p>The surge in unemployment in the United States caused by the Covid-19 pandemic shatters all previous records. In its time, the world\u2019s biggest economy has seen some savage shake-outs of its labour market but nothing that remotely compares to what has just happened.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-record-jump-covid-19-recession-german-confidence-ftse-dow-business-live\">Jobless claims</a> in the week ending 21 March surged to almost 3.3m, which was double what Wall Street analysts had collectively been expecting. The previous worst total in October 1982 was just one fifth of last week\u2019s level.</p> <p>That, though, was during a recession engineered by the then chairman of the Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker, who used ultra-high interest rates to squeeze inflation out of the economy. The pain in the early 1980s gradually ratcheted up: this time it has arrived overnight, with whole sectors of the economy shutting for business last week.</p> <p>As a result, it was an absolute certainty that jobless claims would smash all known records this week. In truth, the actual number was probably closer to 4m because government offices struggled to process the deluge of new claimants. As Paul Ashworth, a US economist at Capital Economics, noted, the increase in California was put at 200,000, whereas more up-to-date information suggests that the layoffs in the country\u2019s most populous state have hit the 1m mark.</p> <p>Further big weekly rises in jobless claims can be expected over the coming weeks \u2013 although they seem unlikely to be quite as big. That\u2019s because the sectors that felt the impact of the shutdown of the economy first \u2013 such as retailing and hospitality \u2013 are also the sectors that employ Americans in their tens of millions.</p> <p>Before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, the US had its lowest unemployment rate since the late 1960s. That is now history. The official jobless rate is about to rocket from just under 4% to at least 10%.</p> <p>Unemployment will start to come down again once the economy is out of lockdown and starts to recover. But it will come down less rapidly than it is going up and \u2013 on past form \u2013 it will leave deep scars.</p> <p>Rising unemployment is not helpful to sitting US presidents seeking re-election, which perhaps explains why the US government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/us-stimulus-package-may-be-massive-but-it-wont-be-enough\">stimulus package</a> contained more generous benefits for those losing their jobs.
