  "<p>Senior US public health officials have pushed back on Donald Trump\u2019s eagerness to reopen the country quickly, as a senior World Health Organization (WHO) figure warned that Covid-19 \u201cis going to be a virus that stalks the human race for quite a long time to come\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/12/americas-billionaire-class-donations\">America's billionaires are giving to charity \u2013\u00a0but much of it is self-serving rubbish | Robert Reich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">researchers at Johns Hopkins University</a>, by Sunday lunchtime more than 530,000 Covid-19 cases had been confirmed in the US and close to 21,000 deaths, making the US the country with the most cases and the most fatalities.</p> <p>In New York, the worst-hit state by far, Governor Andrew Cuomo reported 758 more deaths on Saturday, raising the toll to 9,385, more than three times the state\u2019s death toll from the 9/11 attacks.</p> <p>Cuomo reported signs of progress including a flattening number of hospitalisations but said the daily death rate, also flat but high, was \u201cterrible news\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one number I look forward to seeing drop,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On Saturday night, Trump said a decision to open up the economy was one he alone would make, and would be \u201cthe biggest\u201d of his presidency. He has targeted 1 May as the date when the country may begin a return to normalcy, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1249341768157495296\">in a tweet on Sunday morning</a> cited a drop in hospitalisations as \u201ca very good sign\u201d.</p> <p>But Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading infectious diseases expert, stressed any such move should come only when it was safe and as a gradual process. He also warned of the danger of a resurgence of Covid-19 cases later in the year if things reopened too soon.</p> <p>\u201cIf you just say, \u2018OK, it\u2019s whatever, 1 May, click, turn the switch on,\u2019 obviously, if you do it in an all-or-none way, there\u2019s an extraordinary risk of there being a rebound,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cThat could be a real problem. And everybody knows that.</p> <p>\u201cWhen one starts to relax some of those restrictions, we know that there will be people who will be getting infected. That is just reality. The critical issue is to be able to, in real time, identify, isolate and contact trace.</p> <p>\u201cObviously, New York, [which] is going through a terrible ordeal, is going to be very different from Arkansas, and very different maybe from some places on the west coast, like Washington state, which have been successfully able to prevent that big spike. I think it\u2019s going to have to be something that is not one size fits all.\u201d</p> <p>Fauci was backed by Dr Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug administration (FDA).</p> <p>\u201cThe primary issue here is the safety and the welfare of the American people. That has to come first,\u201d Hahn told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, noting he had not felt political pressure on any decision. \u201cTesting is one component of the response to the outbreak, in addition to the mitigation effort \u2026 so all hands on deck to try to get more diagnostic tests in.\u201d</p> <p>WHO special envoy Dr David Nabarro made a grim prediction.</p> <p>\u201cWe think it is going to be a virus that stalks the human race for quite a long time to come until we can all have a vaccine that will protect us and that there will be small outbreaks that will emerge sporadically and they will break through our defences,\u201d he said, also on NBC.</p> <p>Trump has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-who.html\">highly critical of the WHO</a>, in comments some have seen as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/world-health-organization-coronavirus-donald-trump\">scapegoating</a> to deflect from the failures of his own administration.</p> <p>\u201cThe WHO works on behalf of all the governments in the world and it operates within mandates that are given to it,\u201d Nabarro said. \u201cWe know there will be many things found to have perhaps not been done as well as they could have been, and we\u2019re anticipating there\u2019ll be lots of examinations afterwards. Right now, we have to move forward.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s Sunday tweet appeared to indicate he was still keen to reopen the country sooner than later, having told Fox News on Saturday night he would seek advice from \u201cvery smart people\u201d. Last week, Trump announced he would establish a bipartisan \u201cOpening Our Country Council\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of very smart people, a lot of professionals, doctors and business leaders are a lot of things that go into a decision like that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be based on a lot of facts and a lot of instinct also. Whether we like it or not, there is a certain instinct to it.\u201d</p> <p>Among governors of hard-hit states, instincts tend towards caution. Phil Murphy of New Jersey told CNN 2,183 \u201cblessed souls\u201d had died in his state and repeated to CBS\u2019s Face the Nation: \u201cIf we start to get back on our feet too soon \u2026 we could be throwing gasoline on the fire.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s Fox phone-in came ahead of another <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1249118778404765696\">tweet </a>in which he attacked the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html\">New York Times, which on Saturday reported</a> that the White House failed to act on several explicit security agency warnings in January about the potential for coronavirus to spread to the US.</p> <p>Trump conflated reports on the outbreak and mis-represented Times reporting which said researchers think most Covid-19 cases in New York came from Europe \u2013 not that the virus had originated there.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-us-deep-south-poverty-race-perfect-storm\">'A perfect storm': poverty and race add to Covid-19 toll in US deep south</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSo now the Fake News is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe, NOT China,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThis is a first! I wonder what the Failing New York Times got for this one? Are there any NAMED sources?\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday, for example, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html\">The Times</a> quoted Harm van Bakel, a geneticist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who co-wrote a <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20056929v1\" title=\"\">study</a> awaiting peer review, as saying: \u201cThe majority [of New York cases] is clearly European [in origin].\u201d</p> <p>Trump also claimed the Times was \u201crecently thrown out of China like dogs, and obviously want back in. Sad!\u201d</p> <p>Times journalists were among Americans <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/business/media/china-expels-american-journalists.html\">expelled by the Chinese government</a> in response to the Trump administration limiting the numbers of Chinese citizens who can work for Chinese news organisations in the US.</p>",
  "<p>What a bizarre season this is turning out to be. Last week we saw the exit of one of this season\u2019s most contentious figures, Aiden Zhane. Controversial opinion time: in retrospect, Aiden got a raw deal. It wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to assume that he was purely there to create storyline and stir up tensions. And he paid the price.</p> <p>And now, everyone hates each other. Wait. Did we miss an episode?</p> <h2>The interior delusions lounge</h2> <p>Turns out week seven\u2019s beef is all the result of Untucked, Drag Race\u2019s little sister show. Basically, after the filming of the main show, the queens all sit in one of the production offices and yell at each other. In the US, it airs live right after the main show. Here in the UK, it\u2019s not available on live TV or on Netflix ... If you want to watch it, tough, you can\u2019t. Unless you take it upon yourself to locate it via one of those illegal sites with \u201ctorrent\u201d in the url, which of course we would not condone. Or Pornhub, they seem to have everything these days. Not that I\u2019d know.</p> <p>Heidi is irate at Gigi Goode and even does an irate hair flip. Widow is irate at Jackie Cox, so irate she accidentally spits out a catchphrase, \u201capolo-lie\u201d (a combo of \u201capology\u201d and \u201clie\u201d - sounds good out loud but wouldn\u2019t work on a t-shirt. Sorry, Widow. Nil points to Slytherin. You will NOT be holding a drag brunch sponsored by Butterbeer at The Three Broomsticks). Jan says there\u2019s a \u201cJansition\u201d happening in the show, which is better.</p> <p>We love Heidi but her insecurities are really coming out. Gigi, it seems, is being fairly reasonable and didn\u2019t mean to cause offence, but Heidi is out for blood. *Stanley Tucci voice* GIRD YOUR LOINS! Cue theme song!</p> <h2>Maxichallenge</h2> <p>Please don\u2019t be an acting challenge, please don\u2019t be an acting challenge \u2026</p> <p>Phew! This week\u2019s episode is based on Madonna! She is not one of this week\u2019s guest judges \u2013 if she had been, it would\u2019ve made everything feel a bit less random. Maybe she was busy creating a new skincare range made of Mars mud, ethically sourced chakras and iPad dust. Or maybe she was like \u201cdo a Madonna themed episode as a pitch, and then maybe, MAYBE, I\u2019ll be a guest judge on season 13\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s a musical challenge which, like Snatch Game last week, is always a good ability barometer. To use a patriarchal toxique masculine phrase, it separates the men from the boys. Note to self: Toxique Masculine would be a great drag king name. As would Brent Cross. The challenge entails choreography, recording a song, and presumably, leg work, floor work, chair work and ... hair work.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t make me sing!</h2> <p>The main storyline for the recording scene is \u2013 Jan can sing, many of the other girls can\u2019t. This is an interesting distinction between UK and US drag. The UK drag scene is much more built around cabaret, comedy and live vocals, whereas the US scene is much more look and lipsync focused. RuPaul looked visibly surprised by how well all the girls did at the singing challenge in Drag Race UK \u2013 in the US one, it\u2019s like pulling teeth. Don\u2019t worry girls, it\u2019s being edited by the same producers who do RuPaul\u2019s music, so they\u2019ll know their way around an autotune.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/incorrectdrag/status/1248993291435212801\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">can&#39;t wait for jan to snap next episode <a href=\"https://t.co/1WLLbiMJaE\">pic.twitter.com/1WLLbiMJaE</a></p>&mdash; incorrect drag race (@incorrectdrag) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/incorrectdrag/status/1248993291435212801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 11, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Over to the choreo stage and Widow has fallen into what seems an increasingly common trap on Drag Race \u2013 telling everyone you\u2019re amazing at something, then putting too much pressure on yourself, overdoing it, and creating a disaster. We can relate.</p> <p>A quick shout-out before we move on: the choreographer, Jamal Sim, is great. Consummate, friendly, talented, inventive. He throws together a special routine to work around Widow\u2019s knee injury in seconds, where other guests would have castigated her for complaining. Professionals using their skills to help better and uplift other professionals. More of this please, both in Drag Race and in life in general.</p> <h2>Madonnalogues</h2> <p>Back in the workroom, the girls are discussing Queen Madge. They\u2019re right when they say she\u2019s done a lot of work for the LGBT+ community. She\u2019s worked tirelessly and constantly, and back when it wasn\u2019t cool as well. She also bluntly discussed HIV and AIDs and a time when many other celebrities were scared to. Her Like A Prayer album, released in 1989 came with a leaflet giving facts about HIV. She risked her career to help save people\u2019s lives. THAT is what being an ally is.</p> <p>Heidi reveals that her uncle died as a result of AIDS-related complications. Crystal touches on her father having Parkinson\u2019s, which is an important interlude \u2013 it\u2019s a rarely discussed condition in the mainstream, and she gives a real insight into how difficult and life changing it can be.</p> <h2>Take it to the runway</h2> <p>RuPaul pumps down the runway looking positively sporty. It\u2019s not often we can see her legs! But not our favourite look from her this season, or ever, in fact. Guest judges are gorgeous supermodel Winnie Harlow and ... oh my god. Actual Alexandra Ocasio actual Cortez. Why are we surprised by this. Of COURSE we live in a world where congresspeople are now Drag Race judges. She\u2019s wearing a gorgeous sequin number and a look of excitement mixed with a certain oh-god-what-have-I-done frozen grin. The same look people have on Location, Location, Location when they\u2019ve just agreed to buy a four bed fixer upper in Harrogate.</p> <p>The girls perform their musical numbers \u2013 they\u2019re all pretty good but Wednesday night East London Madonna drag could give any of them a run for their money. So could the ULTIMATE Madonna impersonator, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/nadyaginsburg\">Nadya Ginsburg</a> (many of the jokes in this episode and in this column owe her a massive muffin basket). That said, Crystal and Widow are BRILLIANT. AOC\u2019s eyes are going back and forth like she\u2019s watching a ping pong match.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RuPaulsDragRace/status/1248779152687345664\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83c\udfb6 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CrystalMethyd?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CrystalMethyd</a> better win a Grammy for this song-g-g-g-g-g \ud83c\udfb6 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DragRace?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DragRace</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/LxNdvfr5iz\">pic.twitter.com/LxNdvfr5iz</a></p>&mdash; RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race (@RuPaulsDragRace) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RuPaulsDragRace/status/1248779152687345664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 11, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>For the runway, it\u2019s Night Of A Thousand Michelle Visages \u2013 GENIUS.

Not many people have experienced that. Just her, Madonna and Patsy Stone.</p> <p>We get a gorgeous moment between AOC and Jackie Cox. Aaaw. Nothing but respect for OUR president. Winnie Harlow\u2019s great too, with assured and valuable contributions \u2013 but it\u2019s hard to match up to AOC. Heidi comes out with one of the quotes of the season, sayings her wig is held up by \u201chairspray and desperation\u201d. Heidi, you just described drag! Gigi wins again \u2013 she was great but we\u2019d have given it to Crystal for her superb interpretation of hippy, Ray of Light era Madge.</p> <h2>Lipsync for your LIFE</h2> <p>Uh-oh! It\u2019s Heidi versus Brita. To Madonna\u2019s Burning Up. Heidi says of her dress \u201cit\u2019s a cute girl, I paid ten dollars for it\u201d. This is why we want her to stay.

He doesn\u2019t even have basic hand sanitizer and claims Shipt, a delivery service owned by Target, doesn\u2019t provide any sort of training or support for shoppers through the pandemic, aside from sending them guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4bcaf3d1f34941e9d67d9f4d967cb746289c2d2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bcaf3d1f34941e9d67d9f4d967cb746289c2d2b/1095_0_1154_1156/1000.jpg\" alt=\"We\u2019re left out here to fend for ourselves, address issues and the customer\u2019s orders as best as we can,\u201d said Willy Solis, a Shipt worker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re left out here to fend for ourselves, address issues and the customer\u2019s orders as best as we can,\u2019 said Willy Solis, a Shipt worker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Willy Solis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said Shipt\u2019s support services are virtually non-existent at the moment because they\u2019ve been so overrun with demand.</p> <p>\u201cWe have zero phone support. You call the support number, it hangs up on you. Chat is taking hours. The other option is email, and Shipt is saying it\u2019s taking them 10 days or longer to respond. We\u2019re left out here to fend for ourselves, address issues and the customer\u2019s orders as best as we can,\u201d said Solis.</p> <p>Tips have been decreasing, said Solis, thanks to frustrated customers, and there have been issues with tipping on the app. Shipt workers rely significantly on tips to subsidize their pay.</p> <p>The money he makes is \u201cnot enough to compensate for the risk we\u2019re taking and the level of support we have to expel\u201d, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re begging for support right now. Without being able to complete orders, it\u2019s causing a situation financially where we\u2019re being decimated and it\u2019s becoming worthless for us to do this job,\u201d added Solis.</p> <p>A Shipt spokesperson attributed delays to the increase of demand during the pandemic, and said the company is hiring more support agents and developing a way to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) for shoppers. \u201cFrom the beginning, we\u2019ve encouraged shoppers only to schedule themselves when they feel safe, and we have provided our shoppers with healthy hygiene habits recommended by the CDC,\u201d said the spokesperson.</p> <h2>Jerome Westpoint: sanitation worker for over 40 years in Atlanta, Georgia</h2> <p>Waste collection is consistently <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/27/the-10-most-dangerous-jobs-in-america-according-to-bls-data.html\">ranked one of the most dangerous jobs</a> in the United States, and the coronavirus pandemic has only made matters worse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ab1333f2db3439df4e396cefc07eaee649d34178\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab1333f2db3439df4e396cefc07eaee649d34178/0_400_1200_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jerome Westpoint is a sanitation worker who says he and his colleagues are still waiting on orders to receive face masks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jerome Westpoint is a sanitation worker who says he and his colleagues are still waiting on orders to receive face masks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Teamsters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m in the industrial side of the business,\u201d said Westpoint. \u201cYou do come into contact with hazardous material, sometimes you know it, sometimes you don\u2019t because everyone doesn\u2019t tell you what they\u2019re putting in those containers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou always have those fears because we pick up at hospitals, grocery stores, places like that, and you\u2019re going house to house. We don\u2019t know what is inside those containers. All we know is there is waste in there, but we don\u2019t know if people in these homes are infected with coronavirus and we don\u2019t know how they\u2019re disposing of their waste.\u201d</p> <p>He said workers are still waiting on orders to receive face masks to wear during work hours and it took several weeks for management to impose limitations on waste pickup, such as not picking up waste outside of containers.</p> <h2>Mariah Mitchell: Lyft driver for three years in Seattle, Washington</h2> <p>Every week, Mitchell, a single mother of three, pays $265 weekly to rent a car through Lyft, which has continued to bill full payments through the coronavirus pandemic despite declines in rides. She now receives a priority day once a week where Lyft directs rides to her, equating to about 20 rides for Mitchell. The rest of the week, rides are sparse, but Mitchell is still expected to continue making her car lease payments in addition to living expenses.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no rides. You\u2019re lucky to get one,\u201d said Mitchell. The only day she\u2019s making money is on the one priority day per week she receives from Lyft, and she noted even those have decreased in pay. \u201cBefore the pandemic, I could do 20 rides and make about $10 a ride. Now the rides are about $6 per ride. It should have gone up, not down, because we\u2019re taking a risk.\u201d<br><br>She\u2019s been unable to file for unemployment benefits yet, and Mitchell is concerned that she\u2019ll receive little to no benefits due to the income she is still able to make. Mitchell also explained Lyft is not providing any PPE, and it\u2019s been unavailable in the stores, making it impossible to sanitize her vehicle in between rides.</p> <p>A Lyft spokesperson said in an email the company is working on finding new ways for drivers to earn income, such as delivery partnerships.</p> <h2>Joshua Spence: office janitor in Lubbock, Texas</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb58cd9fcd816161a233fec7b7da49c7fd86dd11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb58cd9fcd816161a233fec7b7da49c7fd86dd11/0_512_1536_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cEvery time folks go out unnecessarily, we cleaning staff have to work extra hard and hope their carelessness won\u2019t hurt us,\u201d said Joshua Spence, an office janitor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Every time folks go out unnecessarily, we cleaning staff have to work extra hard and hope their carelessness won\u2019t hurt us,\u2019 said Joshua Spence, an office janitor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Joshua Spence</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Through the coronavirus pandemic, Joshua Spence\u2019s work schedule as an office janitor hasn\u2019t changed, nor has his low pay at $8.63 an hour. He spends the majority of his time at work directed to do menial cleaning jobs as the majority of the offices are not being used, but several office workers have continued to come in through the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cWe have people who shouldn\u2019t be here coming on to campus to work in their offices so they can get out of the house, violating the stay-at-home order, and I don\u2019t know where they\u2019ve been, what they\u2019ve done, or how seriously they are taking this to begin with, yet I have to be here every workday to clean everything over and over again,\u201d said Spence. \u201cEvery time folks go out unnecessarily we cleaning staff have to work extra hard and hope their carelessness won\u2019t hurt us.\u201d</p> <h2>Eric Anderson: grocery store clerk, Mulberry, Florida</h2> <p>Eric Anderson, 63, works at a grocery store to supplement his social security retirement income. At high risk due to his age and diabetes, Anderson has felt uneasy about the crowds at his grocery store in Florida, where Governor Ron DeSantis refrained from <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/01/825383186/florida-governor-orders-statewide-lockdown\">issuing a stay at home order</a> until 1 April. He recently has taken a two-week unpaid leave and will probably extend it through the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cNobody was staying home, so I had to,\u201d said Anderson. \u201cI\u2019m not getting paid, but as I told my manager I\u2019d rather be broke than dead. The people in my area were business as usual. What got to me was families, elderly people, babies, pregnant women, all came shopping. I worked through this past Friday getting more and more stressed, and when I went in last Saturday, every register was open, people lined up, self checkouts full, aisles full and I decided, enough.\u201d</p> <h2>Jessica Hockaday: Instacart shopper for one year in Raleigh, North Carolina</h2> <p>Jessica Hockaday has worked as an Instacart shopper for the past year in Raleigh, North Carolina, but has been unable to work the past few weeks because she has a heart condition \u2013 cardiomyopathy \u2013 and is high risk for Covid-19.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ee92431476af28da7e084eb6803340294d3701b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee92431476af28da7e084eb6803340294d3701b5/0_6_1080_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cIt was either my health or make money,\u201d said Jessica Hockaday of her decision to stop working for Instacart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was either my health or make money,\u2019 said Jessica Hockaday of her decision to stop working for Instacart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Jessica Hockaday</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was either my health or make money,\u201d said Hockaday. \u201cWe just paid our bills yesterday. We have nothing left and my husband\u2019s next paycheck doesn\u2019t come in for another couple weeks. They truly don\u2019t care about us.\u201d</p> <p>A mother of two, Hockaday started working for Instacart to supplement her husband\u2019s income, which isn\u2019t enough for her family to make ends meet. While she\u2019s been out of work during the pandemic, Instacart has not provided her with any income. She was ineligible to file for unemployment benefits as Instacart classifies their workers as independent contractors, though she will be eligible under the US Senate\u2019s $2tn <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/politics/coronavirus-stimulus-house-vote/index.html\">stimulus plan</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny they call us independent contractors, but we get in trouble if we decline too many delivery batches. They\u2019re entirely in control and get nasty with you for removing a batch that wasn\u2019t paying enough,\u201d added Hockaday.</p> <p>An Instacart spokesperson told the Guardian in an email: \u201cThe health and safety of our entire community \u2013 shoppers, customers, and employees \u2013 is our first priority. Our goal is to offer a safe and flexible earnings opportunity to shoppers, while also proactively taking the appropriate precautionary measures to operate safely.\u201d</p>",
