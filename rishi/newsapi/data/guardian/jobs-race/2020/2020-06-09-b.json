  "<p>The grounding of air travel during the coronavirus pandemic could prompt a jobs crisis in British aviation on the scale of the coal mining industry\u2019s collapse during the 1980s, a report has warned.</p> <p>Putting ministers on notice for a surge in redundancies as airlines confront a future with fewer journeys made by plane even after the outbreak recedes, the New Economics Foundation (NEF) said at least 70,000 jobs in the wider aviation industry \u2013 including engineering, catering and duty free shopping \u2013 were at risk before the end of summer. Thousands of workers in the industry will have to retrain in other areas of the economy, it said.</p> <p>Compiled in collaboration with the TUC, aviation unions and the climate action charity Possible, the study warned this figure would match the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/dec/18/the-demise-of-uk-deep-coal-mining-decades-of-decline\"> job losses in the coal industry in 1980-81</a> in the early years of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s newly elected Tory government, which left lasting scars for communities across the north, Midlands, Wales and Scotland.</p> <p>The warning on aviation jobs comes at a crucial time for firms that have furloughed workers in the UK. Covering the wage bill of almost 9 million workers, the transition away from the furlough scheme is expected to trigger a wave of redundancies in the coming weeks, as the government gradually reduces the support available from August until the scheme closes at the end of October.</p> <p>Redundancy consultations require between 30 and 45 days, depending on the number of staff affected, meaning companies deciding to cut jobs will have to start the process in the coming days.</p> <p>Firms will have to decide whether they can afford to keep staff on furlough when they have to start contributing towards the cost of the government scheme or choose to make workers redundant.</p> <p>Airlines have been among the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/airlines-and-carmakers-benefit-from-uk-covid-relief-scheme\">biggest beneficiaries of government support</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/ba-to-press-ahead-with-job-cuts-plans-despite-furlough-extension-willie-walsh-coronavirus-airline\">British Airways</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ryanair\">Ryanair</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/easyjet\">easyJet</a> placing more than 25,000 staff on furlough between them and borrowing \u00a31.5bn using cheap government-backed loans from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/04/chemicals-firm-basf-biggest-beneficiary-of-uk-coronavirus-loan-scheme\">Bank of England</a>. However, against a backdrop of new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/08/what-are-the-uks-new-quarantine-rules-that-face-a-legal-challenge\">quarantine restrictions</a>, reduced passenger demand due to the health risks from Covid-19, and with fewer planned journeys expected in future, the airlines still plan to make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/28/easyjet-plans-to-cut-up-to-30-per-cent-of-staff-because-of-covid-19-crisis\">thousands of job cuts this year</a>.</p> <p>Faced with the prospect of mounting job losses at aviation industry hubs across Britain, the NEF urged ministers to transform the furlough wage subsidy scheme into a retraining programme to help people move into other sectors.</p> <p>Calling on the industry to negotiate redundancy limits with trade unions, it also said any airline industry bailouts should come with tough conditions forcing the suspension of shareholder dividends, excessive executive pay and tax avoidance, while also demanding firms invest more in green technology and decarbonisation.</p> <p>Of the&nbsp;70,000 jobs immediately at risk over the next three months, the leftwing thinktank said 39,000 were directly in aviation jobs. The remainder are likely to be lost in the wider supply chain surrounding the sector in engineering, food catering, and duty free shopping.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden\u00a0email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The NEF said at least 17,000 workers in the sector would need to permanently move into other areas of the economy, warning that aviation sector employment is unlikely to ever return to pre-crisis levels due to service cutbacks, automation and technological developments.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot consign these workers to the despair of unemployment,\u201d said Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC.</p> <p>\u201cAviation needs immediate support \u2013 and not just to protect the incomes of billionaire airline owners. Government must act now to protect workers\u2019 jobs and livelihoods, to support the longer-term viability of the sector and to facilitate a just transition to lower-carbon operations.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Gareth Southgate has urged people to speak out against white privilege in football as he described the blocking of pathways for black coaches, managers and executives as the \u201cbiggest crime\u201d.</p> <p>The England manager believes the Football Association is working to make \u201cthe boardroom more representative, and that is gender as well as race\u201d. But it is plain that there remains a long way to go and, with the Black Lives Matter movement prominent around the world, he feels it is a \u201cmoment for change\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/09/chris-hughton-looking-at-the-protests-wondering-if-it-will-change-things-yes\">Chris Hughton: 'If I\u2019m looking at the protests and wondering if it will change things, the answer is yes' | Jacob Steinberg</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Southgate opened up as he considered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/09/raheem-sterling-english-football-black-managers-campbell-cole\" title=\"\">comments of Raheem Sterling</a>, the Manchester City and England winger, from the beginning of the week. Sterling questioned why Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard had been given high-profile manager jobs after ending their playing careers whereas Sol Campbell and Ashley Cole had not, as he shone a light on the lack of BAME representation in positions of authority in the British game.</p> <p>Gerrard took over at Rangers after coaching in the Liverpool academy for a little over a year while Lampard, now at Chelsea, got the Derby job a year or so after his retirement. Campbell, who has managed Macclesfield and Southend, has repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jul/08/sol-campbell-non-league-manager-interview\" title=\"\">spoken out</a> about the prejudices he has encountered in the fight for opportunity at the highest levels. Cole hung up his boots last August and is the Chelsea under-15s coach.</p> <p>\u201cI think Ashley Cole is developing very well and on a similar route to what Steven did \u2013 in that Steven worked in Liverpool\u2019s academy for a couple of years,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cOn a broader scale, we lack that representation. The biggest crime for us in any area if we\u2019re adults looking at kids is if they sit and think that a path in life isn\u2019t possible. And is not accessible.</p> <p>\u201cI heard Jermain Defoe say a few days ago: \u2018Is it worth me taking my [coaching] qualifications?\u2019 We have to avoid the feeling that you can\u2019t achieve something because that stops some people going for it. We have to make sure the opportunity is there when people are qualified and capable. And then, of course, they have to grasp that opportunity. If they can do well, they\u2019ll role model what\u2019s possible to the next generation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Southgate namechecked Justin Cochrane, the England under-16s coach, as \u201csomebody who is going to be a top coach\u201d. He said: \u201cWe also shouldn\u2019t look just at the ex-players or high-profile players because so many of the top managers haven\u2019t been top, top international players. That route must also be open to black coaches that haven\u2019t played at the highest level. There will be some super bright lads out there who have come through universities \u2013 they might go the route that a Graham Potter has taken by going back into university. We\u2019ve got to make sure that all of those pathways are open.\u201d</p> <p>Southgate admitted that he had become more aware of white privilege as he got older, having not noticed it during his playing days, when being selected or not was \u201cone of the few areas that was a meritocracy\u201d. He got his break in management at Middlesbrough in 2006, shortly after retiring as a player at the club, despite not having his Uefa Pro Licence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/09/gareth-southgate-optimistic-england-will-return-to-action-in-september\">Gareth Southgate optimistic England will return to action in September</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI know that I got an opportunity at Middlesbrough when I wasn\u2019t qualified,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThat came because I had worked at the club and the owner knew me. But I couldn\u2019t say that opportunity would have been there for somebody else. And I think we are all very conscious of it.</p> <p>\u201cThe power of what is happening at the moment is that people are standing together and these observations, these deeper-seated issues are rightly leading to the broader debate on opportunity, on privilege, and it\u2019s important people speak out. I do feel there is a moment for change but I\u2019m also conscious that we\u2019ve been here before.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have spoken brilliantly over the last week \u2013 people like Troy Townsend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/07/britains-sporting-apartheid-must-end-says-sport-englands-chris-grant\" title=\"\">Chris Grant</a> and David Olusoga.

  "<p>A collective of senior black music industry executives from companies including Warner, Sony, Universal Music Group, BMG, Live Nation, Spotify and the Music Managers Forum has published an open letter to business leaders calling for immediate action on racism and marginalisation within the sector.</p> <p>The newly formed Black Music Coalition welcomed industry statements of support on last week\u2019s #BlackoutTuesday, a music industry-endorsed day of reflection during the ongoing global Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the death in police custody of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>&nbsp;in Minneapolis, but said that it was time to transform that support into \u201ctangible changes\u201d.</p> <p>The letter states: \u201cThe music industry has long profited\u202ffrom the rich and varied culture of black people for many generations but overall, we feel it has failed to acknowledge the structural and systematic racism affecting the very same black community and so effectively, enjoying the rhythm and ignoring the blues.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ukmusic.org/assets/general/UK_Music_Diversity_Report_2018.pdf\">A diversity report commissioned by UK Music in 2018</a> found that ethnic minorities represented 17.8% of roles within the British music industry. While 25.9% of workers age 16-24 age bracket are from an ethnic minority, that number drops steadily to just 11.4% in the 45-64 age bracket, indicating low representation at senior levels.</p> <p>A push for industry diversity had resulted in a lot of black employees in entry-level positions, said Char Grant, a senior A&amp;R manager at BMG. \u201cBut the support structure and the infrastructure for development hasn\u2019t been there so they\u2019ve been left to work it out for themselves. That can be quite a difficult place when you\u2019re not supported.\u201d</p> <p>The coalition, which formed over WhatsApp, has called for the implementation of specific career development programmes for black staff to advance future generations of leaders. It asked for change regarding the lack of black staff in senior management and the complete absence of black female presidents and chairwomen across the industry.</p> <p>The major disparity was with industry \u201cdecision makers\u201d, said Afryea Henry-Fontaine, senior marketing manager at Virgin EMI/ Universal Music Group. \u201cPeople that control the budgets, decide if an act is going to be signed. That\u2019s where there isn\u2019t diversity at all, at that capital-controlling level.\u201d</p> <p>The coalition called for businesses to create dedicated internal task forces to review, drive and challenge its equality and diversity aims, as well as the advancement of black executives across the business, with a focus on equal pay, mentorship and career progression.</p> <p>The lack of black music industry executives has a negative effect on the UK\u2019s rising black musicians, said Henry-Fontaine. \u201cThings are lost in translation. There\u2019s not a sensitivity to different cultural nuances. Those that are advising them outside of management don\u2019t understand the culture in the way that they should.\u201d</p> <p>Following #BlackoutTuesday, Republic Records, home to Ariana Grande and Drake, pledged to stop using the term \u201curban\u201d to describe music made by black artists. The coalition\u2019s signatories called for music companies across the board to cease use of the term and replace it with \u201cblack music\u201d.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Urban\u2019 does often relate to R&amp;B, hip-hop \u2013&nbsp;sub-genres of blackness,\u201d said Whitney Boateng, a promoter at Metropolis Music. \u201c\u2018Urban\u2019 strips away the actual blackness from the music. Black is not a swear word. To say \u2018black music\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean that people who are not black are not included \u2013&nbsp;it just means that you\u2019re giving credit to the actual genre and its makers and forefathers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8843d831e686f313f0e5e52a8d7ee19527ebb85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8843d831e686f313f0e5e52a8d7ee19527ebb85/0_169_6109_3665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"AJ Tracey, whose single Dinner Guest is currently in the UK Top 10.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">AJ Tracey, whose single Dinner Guest is currently in the UK Top 10.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Grant said the term was outdated regarding today\u2019s charts, where black British music is a dominant fixture. \u201cIt\u2019s full of artists that have built their brands and their identities through strong fanbases, and they deserve to be on a level playing field with all the other artists at the top of the charts. \u2018Urban\u2019 doesn\u2019t support the advancement of people\u2019s understanding of the layers of black music. It contributes to the mentality of: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s urban \u2013&nbsp;you need to graduate to pop.\u2019 We need to be rid of that.\u201d</p> <p>The coalition asked music companies to commit a portion of their annual budget to offer financial support to black organisations, educational projects and charities. \u201cThey need more funding,\u201d said Henry-Fontaine. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to come from the government or the National Lottery, and so I think it\u2019s disingenuous for an industry that profits so incredibly well from black culture and black music not to support those projects.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to mandatory anti-racism and unconscious bias training across each company for all non-black members of staff, led by black educators, the coalition asked for complimentary counselling and holistic services to be made available to black members of staff with immediate effect in order to address the effects of workplace racism and global violence against black people.</p> <p>\u201cBlack executives have been experiencing men and women that look like them being racially targeted and murdered by an institution that is supposed to serve and protect,\u201d said Henry-Fontaine. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that play out on the news, on social media, in horrific and callous ways, and then we\u2019re expected to go into a work environment and operate as if everything is normal.\u201d</p> <p>She said it was important for companies to equip black employees with mental health provision and support. \u201cOften our experiences \u2013 especially as black women \u2013 are [dismissed as] \u2018You\u2019re being a bit dramatic\u2019 or, \u2018It wasn\u2019t that bad\u2019 and it\u2019s brushed under the rug. So it\u2019s really important to be able to speak to somebody that can identify and understand and help to unpick that situation without the fear of losing your job.\u201d</p> <p>Sent to CEOs, presidents and industry leaders on Monday morning , the letter has received a positive response. \u201cThis is not going to happen in 24 hours,\u201d said Henry-Fontaine. \u201cThis is a longstanding commitment that we\u2019ve made, and it\u2019s about pushing the conversation forward. It\u2019s about assessing that understanding and working with internal teams to make and push forward long-lasting change.\u201d</p> <p>The open letter follows US executives Brianna Agyemang and Jamila Thomas\u2019s #TheShowMustBePaused initiative on 2 June, which called for the music industry to cease activity for a day in order for black participants to take space for their mental health and for allies to reflect on their obligations to black music communities.</p> <p>While the day provoked a mass social media movement beyond the music industry, some musicians and industry employees criticised the blackout for pledging silence at a time when social media had become a key tool for the spread of information between protesters on the ground.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Henry-Fontaine said she understood the scepticism, but affirmed the importance of the day. \u201cThis is the first time the entire industry has stopped and been so public in their support. The whole purpose is to be in dialogue, to hold companies accountable. These are the first five immediate calls to action. There are many more to come because this is a multifaceted issue.

  "<p>The father of Stephen Lawrence has said black people are still treated as second-class citizens in Britain, with police breaking promises to change they made two decades ago after being shamed by their failure to find his son\u2019s racist killers.</p> <p>Neville Lawrence used a Guardian interview to back peaceful&nbsp;anti-racism protests, saying he was \u201cpleased\u201d by the mass marches <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/09/uk-protests-black-lives-matter-colston-statue-rhodes-live\">sweeping </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/09/uk-protests-black-lives-matter-colston-statue-rhodes-live\">the country</a>, triggered by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/george-floyd-killing-derek-chauvin-bail\">US police killing of George Floyd</a>.</p> <p>Lawrence said racial injustice in Britain was worse than it should be and that the government, from the prime minister down, was not doing enough.</p> <p>Revealing his continuing exasperation with UK policing, he said it was still institutionally racist, as shown by stop and search disproportionately targeting black people.</p> <p>Lawrence, 78, said statues such as that of the slave owner Edward Colston, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">pulled down</a> and dumped in Bristol harbour at the weekend, were \u201coffensive\u201d and should not have been left up in the first place.

This disparity is seen in education, in health, in the workplace \u2013 it\u2019s everywhere \u2013 and it\u2019s a daily lived experience for many.\u201d</p> <p>Basu said he felt moved to see officers take a knee at the weekend, adding: \u201cWe must confront the fact that with many of our communities \u2013 especially the black community \u2013 we still have a long way to go.\u201d</p> <p>Lawrence\u2019s 18-year-old son, Stephen, was murdered in 1993 by a racist gang in south-east London, with police bungling the investigation.</p> <p>He and his wife, Doreen, now Lady Lawrence, spent years fighting the police, who denied wrongdoing, and won a public inquiry which in 1999 found errors were down to incompetence and \u201cinstitutional racism\u201d.</p> <p>Police promises to reform and enshrine racial justice in the ranks, Lawrence said, were not delivered and he still had no idea when they would be kept. \u201cI thought&nbsp;when they came out they would be respected and done in quick time, so people can see they are making the force more fair.</p> <p>\u201cIt was not done in quick time, it\u2019s not been done, I don\u2019t know when it will be done \u2013 we should not be talking&nbsp;about it 21 years later. They have fallen way, way short. Twenty-one years short.\u201d</p> <p>The 2017 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/sep/08/racial-bias-uk-criminal-justice-david-lammy\">Lammy </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/sep/08/racial-bias-uk-criminal-justice-david-lammy\">review</a> concluded that \u201cBAME individuals still face bias, including overt discrimination, in parts of the justice system\u201d. It showed that, while black people comprise 3% of the overall population in England and Wales, they made up 12% of its prison population, with the percentage of black people in prison higher in relation to their share of the general population than the corresponding figure&nbsp;in the US.&nbsp;Just 1.2% of police officers in England and Wales are black, official data shows.</p> <p>Lawrence said police had made some improvements but these were insufficient to gain support in certain communities, damaging their ability to fight crime. \u201cWithout the community behind you it is harder to solve crimes. It is like a them-and-us situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not want people stealing and doing bad things. Some people still think the police are not there for them.\u201d</p> <p>The Met police commissioner, Cressida Dick, has declared that Britain\u2019s biggest force is <a href=\"https://archive.voice-online.co.uk/article/police-force-no-longer-institutionally-racist-says-dick\">no longer institutionally racist</a>. Lawrence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/04/neville-lawrence-to-lead-new-police-monitoring-group\">who has previously praised her</a>, said: \u201cI totally disagree with her. Yes, the police are institutionally racist.\u201d</p> <p>Lawrence cited stop and search as an example. Figures for 2019 show the Met stopped more black people than white, despite black people making up 12%&nbsp;of London\u2019s population and white people 59%. The Met has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jan/26/met-police-disproportionately-use-stop-and-search-powers-on-black-people\">said it is focusing its efforts on the areas with the worst violence.</a></p> <p>Lawrence said some officers were still misusing their powers: \u201cStop and search can be good if done in the proper way. A lot of these officers do not do it in a proper way.\u201d</p> <p>He said he had been stopped and searched, as had his black police family liaison officer, when driving off-duty in plain clothes. \u201cI had to laugh,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a way to pounce on people, it\u2019s an excuse, it\u2019s not a reasonable excuse to stop people.\u201d</p> <p>He said the government should bring back a special steering group to oversee the changes promised after the 1999 Lawrence inquiry.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThere is no one policing the recommendations now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe police&nbsp;cannot be relied on to reform. They are a group of people who do not believe they should be told what to do.\u201d</p> <p>Lawrence said the current Conservative government was failing on racial justice and that Johnson, who has compared&nbsp;women wearing the burqa to \u201cletterboxes\u201d and used the racially offensive term \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d, may himself have a problem with race:&nbsp;\u201cI have not seen anything that has convinced me he has not.\u201d</p> <p>Lawrence said the protests should be peaceful and that those attacking the police should be caught and prosecuted. He said black people were still treated as second-class citizens, \u201cnot only in this country but all over the world\u201d, making action on the streets much-needed. \u201cI am pleased there are lots of people trying to support it.\u201d</p> <p>However, he said he was concerned protesters were potentially exposing themselves to the coronavirus: \u201cThey have made a decision to put themselves at risk to show their displeasure at what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <p>Amid controversy after protesters tore down the Colston statue, Lawrence said: \u201cThe people in power should have the decency to realise it is offensive. They should have removed it. [But] I would not have been part of that group that took it down. The authorities should have known it was offensive and taken it down.\u201d</p> <p>Addressing renewed anger over monuments honouring slave owners and colonialists, Lawrence said: \u201cPeople who have done bad things should not be put up as heroes.

  "<p>For a few hours one Tuesday last May, Brooklyn felt like a lonesome prairie. Oakland-based composer and guitarist <a href=\"https://chuckjohnson.bandcamp.com/\">Chuck Johnson</a> had taken the opening slot at Union Pool, performing a set of solo instrumentals on pedal steel guitar, the sustain-rich country music instrument that can hauntingly convey human weeping. The headline act, NYC quintet <a href=\"https://suss.bandcamp.com/\">Suss</a>, played a medley of the self-described \u201cambient country\u201d soundscapes that they had been making since casually forming at a party some years before.</p> <p>\u201cWe might capture this big sky Montana feel, but we\u2019re urban musicians,\u201d Suss co-founder Bob Holmes says over the phone from his Manhattan apartment. Back in the 80s, he was a member of US cowpunk trailblazers Rubber Rodeo \u2013 now, he\u2019s pushing a placid alternative vision for country. \u201cIt\u2019s about two words: high and lonesome. You get the feeling of expansiveness, of tugging at the heartstrings. It\u2019s warm and inviting music that creates spaces you just fall into and fall in love with.\u201d</p> <p>Country songs traditionally tell stories, but Suss and Chuck Johnson are part of a new crop of artists who emphasise abstract expression over linear narrative and conventional structures. These musicians continue a legacy that joins the dots between country and post-rock, experimental music and world-class pedal steel pioneers such as Susan Alcorn, Robert Randolph and Sarah Jory. Brian Eno\u2019s 1983 LP Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks, which features <a href=\"https://daniellanois.bandcamp.com/\">Daniel Lanois</a> on pedal steel guitar, and <a href=\"https://brucekaphan.bandcamp.com/\">Bruce Kaphan</a>\u2019s 2005 album Slider<em> </em>are some of the hybrid genre\u2019s touchstones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb8152c2a880136f593caf122b4c58cc97e18f8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb8152c2a880136f593caf122b4c58cc97e18f8e/327_551_4022_2413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pedal steel guitarist Chuck Johnson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pedal steel guitarist Chuck Johnson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Paynter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With its various knee levers and strings, the pedal steel guitar \u2013 which originated, pre-pedals, in Hawaii \u2013 is difficult to learn and conventionally used as part of a band. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a machine rather than an instrument, a product of the 20th-century industrial age,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cYou might as well be operating a forklift and be trying to make it sound pretty.\u201d Johnson remembers his first encounter with the pedal steel guitar, back in his home town of Durham, North Carolina. \u201cIt was a total disaster. I couldn\u2019t make anything happen with it, which was humbling, to the point that I didn\u2019t pursue it again for many years.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson did go on to master the instrument and has crafted evocative soundtracks for film, including HBO documentary Private Violence and Emmy award-winning TV show A Chef\u2019s Life. Then, in 2017, he answered a challenge from his label to create a solo album of pedal steel guitar music. <a href=\"https://chuckjohnson.bandcamp.com/album/balsams\">Balsams</a><em> </em>ultimately doubled up as a balm for his injured dog Bubbles, who was recovering from a spinal injury. \u201cI needed to make music that would keep her relaxed as she was nearby while I was working, and she\u2019s very sensitive to music,\u201d Johnson says, as she barks away in the background. \u201cShe tends to prefer drony minimalist music and listens to ambient all the time.\u201d The result is a silvery, soothing guitar record with subtle electronic flourishes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The rise of ambient country \u2013 playlist\">  <iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/5hlvwGw0mDtNhSt7m5Fovs\" width=\"100%\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Elsewhere, Kobe City\u2019s <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ztom-motoyama\">Ztom Motoyama</a>, New York\u2019s <a href=\"https://eeriegaits.bandcamp.com/\">Eerie Gaits</a>, and sprawling Austin band <a href=\"https://balmorhea.bandcamp.com/\">Balmorhea</a> mine similarly serenely mellowed-out soundscapes that create a sense of place, often evoking sundown vistas and wide-open expanses.

She posted on Instagram: \u201c@MSN If you\u2019re going to copy and paste articles from other accurate media outlets, you might want to make sure you\u2019re using an image of the correct mixed race member of the group.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis shit happens to @leighannepinnock and I ALL THE TIME that it\u2019s become a running joke,\u201d she said. \u201cIt offends me that you couldn\u2019t differentiate the two women of colour out of four members of a group \u2026 DO BETTER!\u201d</p> <p>What Thirlwall could not have known, according to sources at the company, is that the image was selected by Microsoft\u2019s artificial intelligence software, which is already responsible for editing parts of the news site, which attracts hundreds of millions of readers worldwide.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f9b5e61f6e4254dd549c72c3cd391324ff7c30d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f9b5e61f6e4254dd549c72c3cd391324ff7c30d/0_0_1241_1764/704.jpg\" alt=\"An Instagram Stories post by Jade Thirlwall criticising the MSN news service.\" width=\"704\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Instagram Stories post by Jade Thirlwall criticising the MSN news service.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jade Thirlwall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Microsoft does not carry out original reporting but employs human editors to select, edit and repurpose articles from news outlets, including the Guardian. Articles are then hosted on Microsoft\u2019s website and the tech company shares advertising revenue with the original publishers. At the end of last month, Microsoft decided to fire hundreds of journalists in the middle of a pandemic and fully replace them with the artificial intelligence software.</p> <p>Asked why Microsoft was deploying software that cannot tell mixed-race individuals apart, whether apparent racist bias could seep into deployments of the company\u2019s artificial intelligence software by leading corporations, and whether the company would reconsider plans to replace the human editors with robots, a spokesman for the tech company said: \u201cAs soon as we became aware of this issue, we immediately took action to resolve it and have replaced the incorrect image.\u201d</p> <p>In advance of the publication of this article, staff at MSN were told to expect a negative article in the Guardian about alleged racist bias in the artificial intelligence software that will soon take their jobs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/26/little-mix-interview-new-album-we-embrace-who-we-are-not-perfect\">Little Mix: \u2018We embrace who we are, we\u2019re not perfect\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because they are unable to stop the new robot editor selecting stories from external news sites such as the Guardian, the remaining human staff have been told to stay alert and delete a version of this article if the robot decides it is of interest and automatically publishes it on MSN.com. They have also been warned that even if they delete it, the robot editor may overrule them and attempt to publish it again.</p> <p>Staff have already had to delete coverage criticising MSN for running the story about Little Mix with the wrong image after the AI software decided stories about the incident would interest MSN readers.</p> <p>One staff member said Microsoft was deeply concerned about reputational damage to its AI product: \u201cWith all the anti-racism protests at the moment, now is not the time to be making mistakes.\u201d</p>"
