  "<p>The Ferrari team principal, Mattia Binotto, has said his team would support serious changes to Formula One race weekends so the season can take place.</p> <p>After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/07/formula-one-furloughs-half-of-staff-while-management-take-20-pay-cut\" title=\"\">Canadian Grand Prix was the ninth meeting to be called off</a> on Tuesday, Binotto emphasised that F1 teams now needed to be flexible in adapting what has been a long-established format and stated that Ferrari would agree to extend the season into February 2021.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/06/formula-one-lose-four-teams-lost-income-coronavirus-mclaren-zak-brown\">Formula One could lose four teams due to lost income, says McLaren chief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the race in Montreal postponed, the first meeting that can take place is the French Grand Prix on 28 June, which is also under threat from the coronavirus outbreak. A minimum of eight races are required to constitute a world championship and, with the weekends available rapidly decreasing, Binotto believes F1 may have to take radical action.</p> <p>\u201cFrom our side, it is really whatever is needed,\u201d Binotto said. \u201cShort race weekend, double races, whenever it will finish, packing all the races together. Whatever it will be, it\u2019s important to be flexible.\u201d</p> <p>It is understood that the concepts of running two races over a single grand prix and removing the Friday practice sessions are currently being evaluated, as is the potential of staging the first races that can be held behind closed doors.</p> <p>F1 is facing a damaging financial blow if racing does not take place and organisers have already discussed extending the 2021 season into next year with teams. Binotto said that Ferrari accepted the proposal. \u201cWe are prepared for it, so in case that is the choice, we will support it. I\u2019m not sure that will be the case but whatever will be, I think it\u2019s important from our side to be supportive and making sure that we will do whatever is necessary.\u201d</p> <p>Revenues will be hit hard by the absence of racing but on Monday the teams failed to come to an agreement on lowering the proposed budget cap of $175m set to be introduced next year. Ferrari are concerned that as a manufacturer of parts for other teams they would be unfairly impeded by a low spending limit. Binotto insisted that now was not the right time to be making such decisions for fear of damaging the sport.</p> <p>\u201cI think we should avoid really being emotional at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that we will face difficult situations but we need as well to somehow maintain the DNA, the essence of F1, which is competition. We should not forget what F1 and motor sport is about.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2>Stephen Colbert</h2> <p>Four weeks into the coronavirus shutdown, there are many things Stephen Colbert misses about the Before Times. But \u201cone thing I have not been missing is Donald Trump\u201d, Colbert said from his home on Tuesday night. \u201cAnd yet, he persists.\u201d</p> <p>The Late Show host joked about the president\u2019s latest press conference, in which he <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/6/21211345/trump-coronavirus-briefing-hhs-ig-report-jon-karl-kristin-fisher\">lashed out at a Fox News reporter</a> for asking about continued shortages in testing and denied <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/06/politics/department-of-health-and-human-services-shortages/index.html\">a critical report from the inspector general</a>. But he broke when he got to a clip of <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/trump-jonathan-karl-third-rate-reporter/\">Trump calling ABC News\u2019s Jonathan Karl</a> a \u201cthird-rate reporter\u201d who will \u201cnever make it\u201d after Karl asked about the inspector general\u2019s report.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWV6WQE5EJc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pWV6WQE5EJc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cWhat is wrong with him?\u201d Colbert asked. \u201cLook, for the record, this inspector general started under Bill Clinton, served for eight years for George W Bush, eight years for Barack Obama.\u201d Colbert cut himself off \u2013 \u201cYou know what? Who gives a shit?</p> <p>\u201cTrump doesn\u2019t understand that no one cares about these hissy fits any more,\u201d he continued. \u201cAll of the drama no longer plays to the camera, sir, not even to your own supporters. Because it doesn\u2019t matter who you voted for \u2013 everyone just wants to know the truth, because that\u2019s how you stay alive. So grow up and do your damn job! We have to. You should, too.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/07/stephen-colbert-on-masks-of-course-trump-says-he-doesnt-want-to-wear-protection\">Stephen Colbert on masks: 'Of course Trump says he doesn\u2019t want to wear protection'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Colbert took a deep breath and paused. \u201cIs it still Tuesday?\u201d</p> <p>In other news, Trump also disclosed a phone call with the former vice-president Joe Biden, which he called a \u201cperfectly friendly conversation\u201d. \u201cYes, it was a perfectly friendly conversation,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cJoe Biden offered advice on how to deal with the pandemic, and Trump asked Biden if he had any dirt on Joe Biden.\u201d</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQXQbcs2UsM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uQXQbcs2UsM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel also decried Trump\u2019s fact-free briefings, including his insistence that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug\">the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine</a> can be used to treat coronavirus (doctors say there is no evidence for this, and taking the drug can have lethal side effects). \u201cWell now it turns out Trump\u2019s inexplicable passion for this drug might be a bit more explicable,\u201d said Kimmel, because \u201cturns out, he has a financial stake in the company that makes the drug. Of course he does. Do we really think he went out of his way to learn how to say hydroxychloroquine for no reason?\u201d</p> <p>Profiting from this unproven treatment \u201cwould be like if he tried to host the G7 summit at one of his own resorts\u201d, said Kimmel. \u201cOh, he did that? Never mind.\u201d</p> <p>As for the lashings of White House journalists such as ABC\u2019s Karl, Kimmel suggested the press crew band together. \u201cOne day, all the reporters should get together and agree to only ask Trump nice questions, just to be dicks,\u201d he said. \u201cOne after the other, they should get up and go: \u2018Mr President, why was your bold leadership so perfect and effective?\u2019 Wouldn\u2019t that be the best?\u201d</p> <h2>Trevor Noah</h2> <p>And on the Daily Social Distancing Show, Trevor Noah turned to the biggest non-corona story of the week: voting, which \u201chas gone from being a boring civic duty to a recipe for disaster\u201d, he said. \u201cCrowds of people packed in a tight space together, sharing pens, elderly poll workers \u2013 it\u2019s a coronavirus all-you-can-eat buffet.\u201d</p> <p>Because of those risks, many states have decided to postpone their primary elections until later this year \u2013 except Wisconsin. The state <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/wisconsin-votes-controversial-election-coronavirus-us-election-2020\">held its primary election</a> on Tuesday as scheduled, \u201cwhich, as you can imagine, is a big problem, because not only were Wisconsinites forced to choose between their health and civic duty, but thanks to so many poll workers dropping out, the number of voting sites was slashed across the state\u201d, Noah explained.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1247710125156073472\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In Wisconsin today, voting went from being a civic duty to a recipe for a public health disaster. <a href=\"https://t.co/yVwUiIOXAH\">pic.twitter.com/yVwUiIOXAH</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1247710125156073472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 8, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>That was especially true in urban areas \u2013 the number of polling stations in Milwaukee dropped from 180 to just five. \u201cFive polling sites for a city of 600,000 people. And I\u2019m sorry guys, those numbers just don\u2019t make sense,\u201d said Noah, struggling to do the math. \u201cThe point is: it\u2019s unfair to the voters.\u201d</p> <p>The meltdown left people waiting for hours to vote in lines snaking around the city, which is \u201cridiculous\u201d, said Noah. \u201cThere are only two reasons people should be waiting in line for hours around a block: either Baby Yoda is doing a meet-and-greet, or you\u2019re buying a pair of sneakers that are too nice to ever wear.\u201d</p> <p>The obvious question, Noah continued, is why didn\u2019t Wisconsin delay its election like every other state? The state\u2019s Democratic governor, Tony Evers, tried to extend mail-in voting, but the Republican legislature and supreme court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/06/wisconsin-primary-election-in-person-voting-coronavirus\">blocked him</a>, for reasons that some Republicans have made shockingly clear. Expanding voting would mean \u201cyou\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-republican-party-voting-reform-coronavirus\">Trump said on a phone call with Fox News</a> last month. Georgia\u2019s speaker of the house said that driving up voter turnout would be \u201c<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/490879-georgias-gop-house-speaker-says-vote-by-mail-system-would-be-devastating\">devastating to Republicans</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is insane, man \u2013 these Republicans are afraid that if more people get access to voting, they\u2019re going to lose elections,\u201d said Noah. \u201cSo instead of just coming up with policies that are more popular, they\u2019d rather just make it harder to vote. Basically, these Republicans believe in the free market for everything except themselves.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I wanted to believe the comforting thought that, when it comes to coronavirus, we are all in this together. That knowing we\u2019re all equally at risk, we\u2019re pulling together in the same direction, bearing the strain equally.</p> <p>The false nature of this belief was initially most obvious in relation to class. Once the lockdown was imposed, a gulf very quickly opened up between those on full salaries working on laptops from home, fretting about having to cancel Easter holidays, and those living hand to mouth, fretting about how to feed their children and avoid being made homeless.<br></p> <p>Government advice revealed its ignorance of how many people actually live. How do you self-isolate when you live in cramped or shared accommodation? How do you reduce shopping trips to once a week when you have little or no storage space? And if you do want to go to the park or do an extra shop, you now risk not only infection, but coming into contact with the police, some of whom are zealously taking advantage of their new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/uk-police-reissued-with-guidance-on-enforcing-coronavirus-lockdown\">social control powers</a>. </p> <p>People in poor areas were already four times more likely to die from avoidable causes, and the link between <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/what-are-health-inequalities\">deprivation and life expectancy </a>has, in some cases, been getting worse. So the potential for Covid-19 to wreak havoc with this disparity seemed obvious, given that it is a disease which adversely affects people with existing health vulnerabilities.</p> <p>But from the outset, we should also have been talking about race. Ethnic minority people are becoming victims of this frightening illness at an alarming rate. A <a href=\"https://www.icnarc.org/About/Latest-News/2020/04/04/Report-On-2249-Patients-Critically-Ill-With-Covid-19\">study</a> of more than 2,000 patients critically ill with the virus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland has found that 35% are black, Asian or other ethnic minority. This is more than double the representation in the wider population.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a dramatic divergence from the usual pattens of pneumonia, where ethnic minorities are affected at more proportionate rates. </p> <p>There\u2019s no equivalent data specifically for doctors, nurses and other health and public-sector workers who have become critically ill. But, anecdotally, the picture looks extreme. The <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/muslim-minority-doctors-die-front-line-uk-pandemic-200401082454308.html\">first four doctors</a> who lost their lives as a result of treating Covid-19 patients in the UK were all Muslim men of African or Asian heritage. Dr Amged El-Hawrani and Dr Adil El Tayar, the first two to die, were both British Sudanese. Habib Zaidi had Pakistani heritage, and Alfa Sa\u2019adu was born in Nigeria.</p> <p>Their deaths were followed by that of the black healthcare assistant Thomas Harvey, who died after treating sick patients with only gloves for protection, and Areema Nasreen, a nurse who died at the hospital where she worked.</p> <p>This may reflect the fact that the NHS has always been heavily dependent on ethnic minority staff, who today make up more than 40% of its medical workforce \u2013 more then double their proportion in the UK population.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth remembering that statistic, given how little it\u2019s been reflected in much of the Clap for Carers campaign coverage. You have to go to some lengths \u2013 as national newspapers seem to have done when they <a href=\"https://www.voice-online.co.uk/news/coronavirus/2020/03/31/why-were-black-nhs-staff-left-out-of-clap-for-our-carers/\">dedicated their front pages</a> to images of NHS staff - to make the health service look entirely white. These are the moments when we rightly applaud the immense heroism of health workers, but also build narratives about our society, about who serves, about who deserves recognition. For the NHS to at that moment appear staffed only by white people, is profoundly dishonest, a true whitewash.</p> <p> </p> <p>This week the #CharitySoWhite campaign issued an urgent call for action over the disproportionate impact of the virus on Britain\u2019s minorities. Their report sets out evidence that reduced access to health treatment compared with white people, the impact of school closures, lower income and insecure housing put ethnic minorities at greater risk.</p> <p>As we have seen time and time again, when government policy claims to be race neutral it ignores the fact that some groups need additional protection or support. Treating everyone the same can embed inequalities. In this case, the impact of austerity and economic meltdown on the charities and voluntary organisations that support local communities needs a targeted intervention.<br></p> <p>To see the scary reality of racial inequality taken to extreme proportions during this pandemic, look to the United States. The tragic consequences have reached all parts of the nation. In <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/early-data-shows-african-americans-have-contracted-and-died-of-coronavirus-at-an-alarming-rate\">Michigan</a>, 15% of the population but 40% of the deaths are black. <a href=\"https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home.html\">Chicago</a> has a 30% African American population, and a 70% African American death rate. The picture from Louisiana is very similar: a 32% black population, with a 70% death rate.</p> <p>Racial disparities have a history, and it is no surprise to see a colonial mindset at work in much of the coronavirus response. From some of the early failure to take advice seriously when it came from east Asian countries, to the debate in France about testing new vaccines on Africans (a time-honoured practice in which black lives are valued less). Covid-19 has a way of drawing out the rot in our systems and exposing them.</p> <p>To say coronavirus is a disease that does not discriminate is wishful thinking. If you are poor, have had a life of income anxiety, poor healthcare, live in inadequate housing and can\u2019t afford healthy food, space and rest, you are vulnerable. Similarly if you are a black or Asian medical professional, no matter how loved by your community and respected in your field.</p> <p>It will take time, far more data, and tragically more deaths, before we fully understand why. </p> <p>\u2022 Afua Hirsch is a Guardian columnist.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 April 2020. Workers from ethnic minorities make up more than 40% of NHS medical staff, not 40% of the NHS workforce as an earlier version said. This has been corrected. </p>",

Many of the actors and writers are also from the queer and trans communities.</p> <p>The show that has been getting me through the lockdown is The Simpsons (Disney+/All4). It might not be queer or gay, really, but it is a little bit, right? It discusses serious issues, but in an irreverent way, which makes it very comforting, because we\u2019re dealing with a lot of serious, scary stuff, so ending the day with some levity and nonsense is a nice tonic.</p> <h2><strong>The Vivienne, RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK </strong><strong>season one</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f3550e4c3425fd0fc53aaf150ca0821a88fc4e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f3550e4c3425fd0fc53aaf150ca0821a88fc4e4/0_0_4284_2570/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The Vivienne from RuPaul's Drag Race UK\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Tiger King makes me think: \u201cOnly in America\u201d\u2019 ...

It\u2019s important because it describes so much of what happens with teenagers when it comes to addiction and partying, and also abuse.

The story is all about heart and forgiveness and proving you\u2019re never too old to learn, even from a 10-year-old. The best episode? Obviously episode seven, starring yours truly and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/06/can-drag-queens-become-pop-stars\">Monique Heart</a>.

Just hearing Rose say something stupid and Dorothy snapping back at her gives me this feeling of comfort \u2013 probably because I\u2019ve watched it so many times. Why do gay men love this show? Well, it\u2019s about four very different, sassy, funny, independent women.

Feimster is a lesbian comedian with a terrific brand of comedy and storytelling. She\u2019s joy-filled and joyous to watch, with this charming southern drawl, and she represents part of the queer community that doesn\u2019t get enough visibility. Women in showbusiness already have a major uphill battle \u2013 and then add her sexuality to that. This woman has been working her entire life and is just starting to become known.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"68a002a2a0f06124df73b415da16128ac89fad4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68a002a2a0f06124df73b415da16128ac89fad4b/0_223_2704_1622/1000..jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A fantastic cast of colour and ability\u2019 ...

It has great storylines \u2013 like Kurt coming out \u2013 and a fantastic cast of colour and ability. It\u2019s diversity in your face! Remember, Glee made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/26/ryan-murphy-american-horror-story-pose-politician-glee-nip-tuck\">Ryan Murphy</a> mainstream, and that led to American Horror Story, which led to Pose.

  "<p>It\u2019s been another staggering week. The coronavirus pandemic continues to wreak societal and economic havoc and cases are now in the millions. The UK, like most countries, was already reeling from the outbreak. Then came the news last Sunday night, around the time the Queen was making a rare televised address to the nation, that prime minister Boris Johnson had been admitted to hospital. Twenty four hours later, came the shocking news that Johnson had been moved into intensive care at St Thomas\u2019 hospital. In this week\u2019s magazine, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dan-sabbagh\">Dan Sabbagh</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason\">Rowena Mason</a> trace the PM\u2019s path from infection to a hospital bed, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickwintour\">Patrick Wintour</a> looks back at other leaders who have been struck down in a crisis.</p> <p>Before that, reporters from our teams in the UK, US and Australia investigate how manufacturers \u2013 from global car giants, to 3D printing pioneers \u2013 are turning their skills towards making ventilators, breathing apparatus and protective equipment. In the US, reports <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tom-perkins\">Tom Perkins in Detroit</a>, that means Ford and General Motors trying to reconfigure huge, complex supply chains to help boost the number of machines available in one of the worst-hit nations. In the UK, Formula One teams have teamed up with universities to make non-intrusive breathing machines, while a former car engineer in Australia has gone from making prosthetics to protective face masks. Will it help to win the fight? </p> <p>One of the few upsides of this crisis is the positive impact it is having on the environment. With billions staying at home and avoiding drives and flights, the impact on air pollution and carbon emissions is likely to be significant. Those factors, combined with an oil production battle between Saudi Arabia and Russia, saw oil prices plummet over the first few months of 2020. Could Covid-19 spell doom for fossil fuel extraction? That\u2019s the question asked by reporters from our business and environment desks this week. Following that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peter-c-baker\">Peter C Baker</a>, a regular contributor to the Guardian\u2019s Long Read section, considers if this once-in-a-lifetime chance to remake the world will be properly grasped by governments.</p> <p>We also have plenty of news away from the virus \u2013 including the election of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer\">Keir Starmer</a> as the new leader of the UK\u2019s Labour party and a brilliant extract from Craig Brown\u2019s jawdropping new biography of the Beatles.</p> <p>Get the Guardian Weekly delivered to your home <a href=\"https://support.theguardian.com/uk/subscribe/weekly?promoCode=WWM62X\">here</a>.</p>"
