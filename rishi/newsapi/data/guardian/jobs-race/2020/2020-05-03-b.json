  "<p>Justin Amash left the Republican party because it was in a \u201cpartisan death spiral\u201d but insists his White House run as a Libertarian won\u2019t help Donald Trump maintain the GOP\u2019s grip on the White House.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/trump-adviser-larry-kudlow-coronavirus-relief-aid-sanctuary-cities\">Trump adviser: coronavirus relief aid threat to \u2018sanctuary cities\u2019 could happen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWashington is totally dysfunctional,\u201d Amash told CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s why I left the Republican party, because there was this partisan death spiral.</p> <p>\u201cWe need someone who\u2019s going to come in as president, respect our constitution, defend our rights, and fix our representative system of government so that people will actually feel represented at home. And I know that millions of Americans want that.\u201d</p> <p>The former member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/04/justin-amash-quits-republican-party\">left the Republicans in 2019</a>. He then <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/ej-montini/2019/12/19/rep-justin-amash-voted-impeachment-does-make-bipartisan/2696156001/\">voted to impeach Trump</a> and remove him from office, as the GOP stayed ranged behind the president.</p> <p>Amash announced his third-party run this week, to criticism that he risked taking voters from Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic challenger who leads the president in many national and key-state polls.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know how the additional candidate changes a race,\u201d Amash insisted on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s too impossible to figure out. There are too many calculations involved. So, the most important thing is that we have a ballot. If you want to vote for someone, you vote for that person.\u201d</p> <p>Many observers suggest third-party candidates can change presidential elections.</p> <p>In 1992, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/09/ross-perot-obituary\">Ross Perot ran as an independent </a>and won 19% of the vote as a Democratic challenger, Bill Clinton, beat incumbent Republican George HW Bush.</p> <p>Green candidate Ralph Nader\u2019s run eight years later is perhaps the most famous third-party campaign, given that George W Bush beat Al Gore in a desperately tight race.</p> <p>Nader told the Guardian this week \u201cthere are all kinds of other reasons that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> lost\u201d in 2000, not least that Bush \u201cwas selected by five out of nine supreme court justices in a judicial coup d\u2019etat\u201d.</p> <p>But the political strategist Bob Shrum countered that Nader \u201churt because he attacked Gore from the left: that was his argument.\u201d</p> <p>Shrum added: \u201cI don\u2019t know that Amash is in the same position. The assumption that he would take votes from Biden rather than Trump seems dubious to me at best.\u201d</p> <p>Amash is <a href=\"https://www.clubforgrowth.org/scorecards/app/?party=all&amp;chamber=H&amp;yr=2018&amp;state=all&amp;rep\">a stringent conservative</a>, unlikely to appeal to many supporters of a centrist Democrat pushed left on policy by the challenge of Bernie Sanders and committed to naming a woman, quite possibly an African American, as his proposed vice-president.</p> <p>In 2016, the Libertarian Gary Johnson took nearly 4.5m votes nationally. Trump however lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3m ballots.</p> <p>The White House was won, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/11/donald-trump-rick-wilson-running-against-the-devil\">as it always is</a>, in the electoral college.</p> <p>In that fight Amash\u2019s home state, Michigan, was a key win for Trump over Clinton by just 10,704 votes, less than 0.25%, while Johnson <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/michigan\">won the support of 172,136 Michiganders \u2013 or 3.6%</a> of turnout. The Green candidate, Jill Stein, won 51,463 votes, or 1.1%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/02/tara-reade-joe-biden-accusation-sexual-assault-report\">Tara Reade says she didn't explicitly accuse Biden of assault in Senate report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rejecting criticism from the former congressman Joe Walsh, who ran against Trump in the Republican primary and told the Guardian his friend was making \u201ca huge mistake\u201d, Amash insisted \u201cthere\u2019s an opening for a Libertarian party to become a major party in this country\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re at a crossroads. There is a difference over the last decade or so, where people are more polarized, more upset, but, actually, most Americans are delightful people, are polite people, want to work with each other, respect each other.</p> <p>\u201cAnd these two factions that really control our political system are destroying our system and making it impossible for the rest of us to, frankly, enjoy our lives.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>We\u2019re down to the big hitters now. No more struggling out of lampshades on the runway and no more desperately snatching your wig off during a lipsync.</p> <p>The queens that are left by episode 10 are always the most perfected. As perfected as an Absolut cocktail in the Interior Illusions Lounge. Those were the days! (this column does not officially endorse Absolut or Interior Illusions \u2013 other brands are available. DING!)</p> <p>We\u2019ve only got Jaida Essence Hall, Heidi N-Hydrates-Van-Cartier-Dupree-St-James-Closet, Gigi Goode, Jackie Cox, Crystal Methyd and someone called Sherry Pie remaining. They\u2019re all great in their various ways \u2013 this has been the best top six in a very long time. But which of the six tops do you want to see WIN?</p> <h2>RuPaul\u2019s FAN Race</h2> <p>Widow Von\u2019Du was eliminated last week and Heidi surprises herself by saying \u201cand with that, we bid Miss Widow Von\u2019Du ... adieu. Oh yes bitch, French!\u201d Jackie Cox won the lipsync while wearing a hijab which, pleasingly, sparked actual intelligent conversation and received a largely positive response from viewers. Times have changed. It\u2019s probably fair to say that, if this look had been seen on season two of Drag Race, a decade ago (!) the response would have been considerably frostier. (If it had been season one nobody would have been able to see it through the soft-focus filter).</p> <p>For this week\u2019s maxichallenge, the girls are giving a drag makeover to female superfans of the show. Oh, so AFAB people are allowed on the show as guests but not as contestants? OK, Ru, we see how it is. AFAB stands for \u201cAssigned Female At Birth\u201d. In 2020, we\u2019re AAA \u2013 All About Acryonyms. Or, if you like, that can also stand for world famous drag troupe, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnCjUsc7y2M\">AAA Girls</a>). We\u2019ve had a coffee. A lot of coffee.</p> <p>Anyway, it\u2019s a delight seeing women on the show and getting at least a<em> passing </em>acknowledgement of the fact that women can do drag too. This is a great idea, and a touching tribute to the show\u2019s instrumental and intensely loyal fanbase. The makeover episode has historically been a game-changer, because it depends entirely on who you\u2019re paired with \u2013 if even the best contestant is paired with a makeover subject who\u2019s a nightmare, it can send them spiralling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbdeb3e48df844ccf37fcecf352d65a4ace951e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbdeb3e48df844ccf37fcecf352d65a4ace951e6/100_58_1241_745/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Janet the planet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Superfan Janet made a better Sherry Pie than the real thing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VH1</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Janet The Planet</h2> <p>Superfans Bethany, Nicole, Janet, Shea, Tiffany and Grace walk in and their excitement is irresistible. This is so cute. Exactly the warmth and wholesomeness we need right now. Crystal and her partner Grace seem very well matched \u2013 both have louche indie kid energy. Hilariously, Jaida\u2019s partner Bethany, who she chose first, has issues walking in heels. Janet The Planet (\u201ca rollercoaster of a woman\u201d according to Gigi Goode) and Sherry Pie have a great chat about how Janet found solace and family in the drag community.</p> <p>Jackie\u2019s partner Tiffany says she started watching Drag Race from season 1, when she was 11 years old. The fact that there are now adult Drag Race fans that literally grew up with the show is ... a lot. Heidi\u2019s partner Nicole opens up about her experiences with bullying, and it brings us to tears. We just cried at Drag Race. This lockdown needs to end NOW.</p> <p>Ru says to Nicole \u201cdrag doesn\u2019t change who you are, it <em>reveals</em> who you are\u201d and Nicole responds \u201cdrag brings joy\u201d. Patent it, market it, put it on a t-shirt. $45 not inc. post &amp; packaging. May cause dryness. RuPaul departs the workroom with a final twist \u2013 the superfans will be lipsyncing! This. Is. Genius.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"63c9404dfd6a4c2de4a6053d4ef8d53415c21d8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63c9404dfd6a4c2de4a6053d4ef8d53415c21d8c/0_95_1256_753/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jaida\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jaida gets totes emosh discussing her partner with superfan Bethany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VH1</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jaida says to her partner \u201cif you come out on the main stage with the mentality that your feet are gonna hurt and you\u2019re gonna fall down \u2013 then your feet are gonna hurt and you\u2019re gonna fall down!\u201d Unarguable and accurate, but not particularly reassuring. In fact, that sums up Jaida in general.</p> <h2>Take it to the runway</h2> <p>RuPaul is SHIMMERING in a lense flare-inducing glissade of encrusted bodice. Michelle Visage says \u201chi dad!\u201d and we just spat out our coffee. Ross Matthews is here and plugging his new book so shamelessly that it\u2019s hilarious. The special celeb judge this week is Daisy Ridley, one of the highest paid movie stars in the world currently. We\u2019d quote her character from Star Wars but she doesn\u2019t have any remotely memorable lines. Don\u2019t agree? Quote one of her Star Wars lines. Go on. See! You can\u2019t think of any. She\u2019s a great Drag Race judge though, giving considered critique and even swearing. You can tell that Disney contract\u2019s up.</p> <p>Crystal and her partner\u2019s looks are a wild and brilliant clown/troll/Bert and Ernie mashup. Sherry Pie and her partner look EXACTLY the same, it\u2019s spooky (the partners now have drag names too but we\u2019re getting so confused by the five thousand names floating around that we\u2019re just going to say \u201cpartner\u201d). Gigi Goode and Bebe Bad (ok, that\u2019s easy to remember) are giving ski lodge Bond girl. Jaida\u2019s partner\u2019s makeup is flawless. We need a gif of Daisy Ridley saying \u201cyas ... queen ... werk.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ridleydaisy/status/1256434340772208640\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">daisy ridley as a guest judge in drag race fancam <a href=\"https://t.co/sTQLcl8bLX\">pic.twitter.com/sTQLcl8bLX</a></p>&mdash; carla (@ridleydaisy) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ridleydaisy/status/1256434340772208640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 2, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Just when Ross Matthews was starting to be vaguely appealing, he makes an awful joke about beating faces.

And the song just HAPPENS to be disco hit, Alex Newell\u2019s Kill The Lights. How utterly fortuitous and totally unplanned! It\u2019s the best lipsync of the season so far. THEY BOTH STAY. Daisy Ridley is crying \u2013 showing more emotion in three seconds than she did in three instalments of Star Wars (THE SHADE).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/strayed1997/status/1256710705862062081\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Heidi N Closet vs Jackie Cox - RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race Lip Sync <a href=\"https://t.co/87fhG504aJ\">pic.twitter.com/87fhG504aJ</a></p>&mdash; Andrey Schaar (@strayed1997) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/strayed1997/status/1256710705862062081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 2, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>Notes and observations</h2> <p><strong>Shadiest moment </strong>The aforementioned comments about Daisy Ridley\u2019s acting ability.

  "<p><strong>How important was it for you to write this book and have your story heard?<br></strong>It was crucial. It has been incredibly therapeutic and healing to write it. I almost felt compelled to do it. It\u2019s not about getting back at the police, it is about saying to other people who might be in a similar position to me: \u201cI hear you, you are not alone.\u201d It\u2019s also a message to my former colleagues, many of whom are now in senior positions, saying: \u201cThese are the consequences of your words and actions, please listen and think.\u201d But it\u2019s not about portraying myself as a victim. I don\u2019t want to call myself a victim because that would mean that it has all been for nothing and they have won.</p> <p><strong>Do you regret having given so many years of your life to the police?<br></strong>The biggest regret I have, which also blurs into shame, is that I allowed it to happen and that I said nothing for such a long time. I also feel a lot of shame that I joined the force in the first place and didn\u2019t listen to the friends who warned me not to. Perhaps if my mum had tried to stop me I would have listened to her but she had respect for the police and she encouraged me. Now when I think about those wasted years, which I will never get back \u2013 I can\u2019t describe how that feels. I lost everything \u2013 my marriage, my home, my income, my mental health. All of it.</p> <p><strong>Looking back now, what would you have done differently?<br></strong>Maybe the best thing I could have done would have been to get out of the force much earlier. But who wants to quit on their dream? Who wants to admit defeat? Also, I wouldn\u2019t have fought them in court. I recognise now that courts are not the place to battle race discrimination. For a person of colour like me to go into a courtroom, a white institution, and to have to convince the person on the bench of my reality, my lived experience \u2013 how are they going to get that when they don\u2019t walk in my shoes? It was hard to swallow how I was treated in court.</p> <p><strong>Will the police ever be able to eliminate the racism, homophobia and sexism you experienced in the force?<br></strong>I think is too ingrained and I doubt it will change in my lifetime. It\u2019s a cancer in the police and nobody knows how to cut it out. The leadership have a lot to answer for. They talk the talk but there is no real punishment for misbehaviour. Two officers accused in my case, Inspectors Quantrell and D\u2019Orsi, were promoted afterwards. That was their reward. What message does that send out?</p> <p><strong>At the end of the book, you write about starting to rebuild your life. How have you moved forward?<br></strong>I was homeless for two and a half years after leaving the police. I had to sleep in a hostel bedroom with 11 other people. It nearly destroyed me. I think one of the only reasons I survived it was that after living in police accommodation, I\u2019d already been institutionalised. I moved into social housing a couple of years ago and after that I got heavily into writing this book and a second book I am working on. I have also been having therapy, doing group counselling, trying to lose weight and get in shape, trying to reconnect with friends and family. So I\u2019ve been slowly trying to put back in place all the positive things this experience had taken away from me. I\u2019m nowhere near finished the process yet.<br><br><strong>What is your second book about?<br></strong>It\u2019s about homelessness and what you do after you have lost everything, including a place to live. Eight million of us are one pay cheque away from losing our homes and over 300,000 are homeless. I want to try and broaden the conversation about housing and homelessness, loneliness and loss.</p> <p><strong>What advice would you give to a young black man or woman, gay or straight, thinking of joining the police force today?<br></strong>This is a hard question to answer. If I were to start saying to young black and brown boys, gay young men or lesbians, \u201cDon\u2019t join the police\u201d, then nothing is ever going to change. I believe the force desperately needs more black and brown recruits, more gay recruits. But to paraphrase <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/jan/14/saturday-interview-neville-lawrence-stephen\">Neville Lawrence</a>, I would advise them to go in with their eyes wide open. They need to be very mindful about the attitudes and prejudices they are likely to face.<br></p>"
