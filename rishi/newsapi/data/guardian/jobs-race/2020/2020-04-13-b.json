  "<p>Coronavirus is a disaster that we should have been prepared for, because it was expected. In 2015, the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-risk-register-for-civil-emergencies-2015-edition\" title=\"\">national</a> <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-risk-register-for-civil-emergencies-2015-edition\" title=\"\">risk</a> <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-risk-register-for-civil-emergencies-2015-edition\" title=\"\">register</a> of potential calamities calculated that there was between a one in 20 and a one in two chance of pandemic influenza hitting the United Kingdom within five years, with catastrophic results. You would not bet against those odds. But we did.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/its-shameful-to-blame-doctors-for-shortages-of-ppe\">It\u2019s shameful to blame doctors for shortages of PPE | Letter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rather than using the risk assessment to justify major investments, the country stockpiled an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/government-under-fire-over-ppe-and-testing-as-uk-death-toll-passes-10000\" title=\"\">inadequate supply</a> of masks, ventilators and gowns in hospitals, and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52205655\" title=\"\">body bags</a> in mortuaries. A dearth of such essentials puts the lives of doctors, nurses and care workers at risk, and causes unbearable sadness. Instead of saying sorry for the shortages, ministers use the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/priti-patel-says-sorry-if-people-feel-there-have-been-failings-over-ppe\" title=\"\">shameful evasion</a> of acknowledging <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tory-alok-sharma-says-hes-21853572\" title=\"\">their regret</a> if the public feels let down. A sincere ministerial apology is long overdue.</p> <p>The Sars-CoV-2 virus is deadlier and spreads faster than earlier viral pathogens. The timing of the outbreak could not have been exactly foretold. But it was likely and getting likelier because of climate change, rising population growth and the globalisation of travel. Ministers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/29/uk-strategy-to-address-pandemic-threat-not-properly-implemented\" title=\"\">cannot avoid responsibility</a> for the unfolding catastrophe. They underestimated the resilience of the population to a repressive lockdown, citing modellers\u2019 warnings that this \u201c<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/873723/03-potential-effect-of-non-pharmaceutical-interventions-npis-on-a-Covid-19-epidemic-in-the-UK.pdf\" title=\"\">would result in a large second epidemic once measures were lifted</a>\u201d. Yet within days the government shifted its view. While the advice \u2013 and even the advisers \u2013 can change, it is the task of those in office to take decisions. Ministers can be guided by counsel, but they cannot hide behind it. To contain the virus, nations must quickly develop a test and use it to identify infected people, isolate them and trace those they\u2019ve had contact with. Two countries with comparable populations to the UK \u2013 Germany and South Korea \u2013 have done so. We did not. Germany is testing more than five times as many of its citizens as the UK, and its death toll is less than a third. South Korea, a country of 52 million people, has recorded just <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-korea/\" title=\"\">217 deaths</a> \u2013 43 times fewer deaths per head of population than the UK, where more than 11,000 have died.</p> <p>Ministers say they took \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-9-april-2020\" title=\"\">the right decisions at the right time</a>\u201d. Yet the evidence is that shutting down Britain earlier would have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laineydoyle/status/1249127908876128259\" title=\"\">saved lives</a>. By the time ministers acted, the Covid-19 virus had spread faster and wider than might have been the case, by which point the materials and equipment needed were harder to procure. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, compares his job stocking the NHS with personal protective equipment every week to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-52248190/coronavirus-hancock-says-ppe-distribution-a-herculean-logistical-effort\" title=\"\">a task of Hercules</a>. A more apt figure from Greek mythology might be Sisyphus, who was condemned by the gods to push a rock to the top of a mountain, only for it to roll back down again so he had to repeat the punishment.</p> <p>Both <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d979c0e9-4806-4852-a49a-bbffa9cecfe6\" title=\"\">Germany</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/south-korea-beating-coronavirus-citizens-state-testing\" title=\"\">South Korea</a> have well-resourced health systems and a political culture of being responsive to their citizens. The UK has spent the last decade rewarding the NHS with the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/spending-english-nhs/\" title=\"\">lowest funding settlement</a> for decades and its frontline staff with tiny pay rises. Covid-19 has shown that a well-run and properly funded state is the difference between living and dying. A decade of Conservative administrations, with an antipathy to the public sector, has meant it is safer to be in Seoul than London. The job of government is to protect its citizens. It is an indictment of ministers\u2019 actions that the UK state has proved not resilient and strong enough to do so.</p>",
  "<p>Kyle Larson has been suspended without pay by both Nascar and his team, Chip Ganassi Racing, after using a racial slur during an esports event on Sunday.</p> <p>Larson is currently seventh in the drivers\u2019 championship. But with racing across the world suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic, he was taking part in an online competition called Monza Madness, organised by fellow driver Landon Cassill on Sunday night.</p> <p>Larson was streaming his participation live on Twitch when he appeared to lose communication on his headset. The 27-year-old then said to his spotter, \u201cYou can\u2019t hear me?\u201d before following up his question with the N-word.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/06/bubba-wallace-quits-nascar-iracing-motorsports-bristol\">'Peace out': Bubba Wallace 'rage quits' as tempers flare in Nascar's virtual race</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was immediate shock and outrage from his fellow drivers. Anthony Alfredo reminded Larson that viewers could hear his comments: \u201cKyle, you\u2019re talking to everyone, bud,\u201d said Alfredo.</p> <p>On Monday, Ganassi issued a statement suspending Larson. \u201cWe are extremely disappointed by what Kyle said last night during an iRacing event,\u201d read the statement. \u201cThe words that he chose to use are offensive and unacceptable. As of this moment we are suspending Kyle without pay while we work through this situation with all appropriate parties.\u201d</p> <p>Nascar reacted shortly afterwards, indefinitely suspending Larson. \u201cNascar has made diversity and inclusion a priority and will not tolerate the type of language used by Kyle Larson during Sunday\u2019s iRacing event,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOur Member Conduct Guidelines are clear in this regard, and we will enforce these guidelines to maintain an inclusive environment for our entire industry and fan base.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KyleLarsonRacin/status/1249732388625752065\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/RPsp7ARIea\">pic.twitter.com/RPsp7ARIea</a></p>&mdash; Kyle Larson (@KyleLarsonRacin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KyleLarsonRacin/status/1249732388625752065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 13, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Larson has since apologised in a video posted to social media. \u201cI just want to say I\u2019m sorry. Last night I made a mistake and said the word that should never, ever be said,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for that. I wasn\u2019t raised that way. It\u2019s just an awful thing to say. I feel very sorry for my family, my friends, my partners, the Nascar community and especially the African-American community. I understand the damage is probably unrepairable, and I own up to that. But I just want to let you all know how sorry I am, and I hope everybody is staying safe during these crazy times. Thank you.\u201d</p> <p>Larson, whose mother is Japanese American, is a graduate of Nascar\u2019s <a href=\"https://hometracks.nascar.com/drive-for-diversity/\">Drive for Diversity</a> programme, which is intended to promote wider participation in the sport. He has won six races in his eight years in the Nascar Sprint Cup series and was rookie of the year in 2014. In 2015 he won the 24 Hours of Daytona.</p> <p>There has been a proliferation of esports competition since racing was suspended earlier this year, and Larson is not the first driver to find himself at the centre of controversy. Last week Bubba Wallace was dropped by a sponsor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/06/bubba-wallace-quits-nascar-iracing-motorsports-bristol\">after he \u201crage quit\u201d during a race</a> being broadcast live on Fox Sports. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t take this shit serious. Peace out,\u201d he said before exiting.</p> <p>Ben Blessing, an executive from Wallace\u2019s sponsor, Blue-Emu, condemned the driver\u2019s behaviour. \u201cWe aren\u2019t sponsoring Bubba any more,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you imagine if he did that in real life on a track? You find out that you aren\u2019t sponsoring a Nascar driver, you are sponsoring someone like my 13-year-old son who broke his controller playing some game where he builds houses.\u201d</p>"
