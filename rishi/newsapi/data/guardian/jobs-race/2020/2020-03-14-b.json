This racism persisted across the Atlantic too. \u201cBetween 1889 and 1914 Lux soap advertisements claimed that the product could care well for all kinds of materials and \u2018wont (sic) shrink wool\u2019 which was represented by a black male child sitting in a tub, his hair covered in a mound of white suds.\u201d</p> <p>The list of crimes against black hair continues to this day.

  "<p>Cambridge University may scrap a controversial mentoring scheme to help senior white academics and managers tackle institutional racism because some of those involved have failed to take its work seriously. </p> <p>Black, Asian and minority ethnic staff (BAME) who \u201creverse-mentored\u201d senior white colleagues also found participating in the scheme to be a burden, according to Joanna Jasiewicz, an equality and diversity consultant at the university. This was partly due to a lack of commitment by some mentees, she added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/15/chelsea-kwakye-and-ore-ogunbiyi-taking-up-space-merky-books-interview\">What Cambridge University taught us about racism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pilot scheme, which paired BAME mentors with white senior academics and managers, including the vice-chancellor, Prof Stephen Toope, was launched last year in a bid to encourage \u201cinstitutional change\u201d and address structural racism at the university. The aim was to equip senior white staff with the confidence and skills to challenge racism when they came across it.</p> <p>But Jasiewicz told a conference on tackling harassment in higher education in London that there were \u201cmixed feelings\u201d among staff about the scheme.</p> <p>\u201cWe know from the pilot [scheme] the mentees said they benefited, but what we heard from the mentors about it was it was yet another burden for BAME staff,\u201d she told the conference, organised by Universities UK, which represents 136 higher education institutions across the country.</p> <p>\u201cThe [white] mentees hadn\u2019t really taken on board that they were doing something serious,\u201d said Jasiewicz, noting that some of them had failed to do work set as part of the programme, such as watching recommended videos. There was no suggestion that the vice-chancellor was among those who had not complied with the scheme.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the BAME mentors were uneasy with the emotional labour involved in helping senior white staff better understand issues surrounding ethnicity and racism, she added.</p> <p>Jasiewicz invited staff interested in joining a further pilot scheme to a meeting later this month. But she told the conference it would be scrapped if the BAME staff involved remained dissatisfied. \u201cIf it\u2019s not really great for the mentors, we will drop it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to make sure the mentees work hard.\u201d</p> <p>Priya Gopal, a senior academic at Cambridge University\u2019s English faculty, said: \u201cI\u2019m not at all surprised that it\u2019s run into problems. It is an additional burden on BAME staff \u2013 something that has not been sufficiently accounted for \u2013 and it can put junior staff in a difficult position. It\u2019s not been my experience that many heads of departments and colleges really want to hear how bad things are. There is a culture of not taking race seriously.\u201d</p> <p>Jasiewicz said the reverse mentoring scheme hoped \u201cto deepen the understanding of racism at the leadership level, and how it can be acted upon.\u201d She continued: \u201cWe are currently evaluating the scheme and aim to improve its benefits, particularly for the mentors.\u201d</p> <p>Ammara Khan, head of Race Equality Charter at Advance HE, a higher education charity, told the conference: \u201cWe hear good stories about reverse mentoring. The only downside is the emotional labour for the BAME staff, which can be quite painful. It does take a toll on BAME staff and that has to be recognised.\u201d </p> <p>A university spokesman denied that the scheme was being scrapped. He added: \u201cWe are hugely appreciative of the efforts of those who volunteered as mentors and recognise that some of them have found it a challenging experience. As we continue to develop the scheme, we will listen to their feedback and provide them with additional support if they feel they need it.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This picture on this article was changed on 16 March 2020 to better reflect the text.</p>"
