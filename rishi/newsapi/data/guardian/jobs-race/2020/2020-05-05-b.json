  "<p>The Trump administration is poised to break up the White House coronavirus taskforce, the public face of the US response to the virus, even as experts warn that the worst is yet to come.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/trump-coronavirus-taskforce-pence-us-death-toll\">Trump poised to wind down Covid-19 taskforce as US death toll tops 70,000</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Here is what we know so far about the taskforce and where the US stands in its response to Covid-19.</p> \n<h2>What is the coronavirus taskforce?</h2> \n<p>Days after public health officials announced the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/21/coronavirus-us-cdc-case-china-health\">first confirmed case</a> of Covid-19 on US soil on 21 January, the White House <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-presidents-coronavirus-task-force/\">announced</a> that it had formed a taskforce that would lead the federal government\u2019s response to the pandemic. The group, it said, would work together to monitor, contain and mitigate the spread of the virus in the US and keep the public informed about important public health and travel guidance.</p> \n<p>By March, as the US reported thousands of new cases of Covid-19 every day, the taskforce gave daily press briefings, ostensibly to update Americans about the public health emergency.</p> \n<p>But at the end of April, the briefings stopped. The last press conference was held on 24 April. According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/donald-trump-stays-away-from-briefings-amid-fallout-from-disinfectant-comments\">reports</a>, Trump\u2019s advisers said his daily appearances were hurting his chance of re-election in November, especially after he suggested \u2013 with no evidence \u2013 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/trump-coronavirus-treatment-disinfectant\">disinfectant could fight the virus in human bodies</a>.</p> \n<h2>Who is on the taskforce?</h2> \n<p>Headed by Mike Pence, the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-presidents-coronavirus-task-force/\">taskforce</a> is made up of members of Trump\u2019s cabinet, including Alex Azar, secretary of health and human services, and Steve Mnuchin, secretary of the treasury. There are also representatives from different departments, such as transportation and defense, and various advisers to the president.</p> \n<p>Trump appointed two well-respected epidemiologists, Drs Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, to the taskforce. Both, though especially Fauci, have been widely regarded as the sober voices centered on public health, in contrast with the political figures on the taskforce.</p> \n<h2>What effect is Covid-19 having on public health in the US?</h2> \n<p>Data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and released on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/05/coronavirus-us-live-fauci-warns-against-rush-reopen-trump-cuomo-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5eb1aa4d8f08da022712b0eb#block-5eb1aa4d8f08da022712b0eb\">showed</a> that the number of coronavirus deaths in the US had passed 70,000 \u2013 far more than any other country, and over a quarter of all coronavirus deaths in the world. As of Tuesday afternoon, the US had nearly 1.2m confirmed cases, one-third of the worldwide total.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/donald-trump-coronavirus-economic-recovery\">Trump gives up on virus fight to focus on economic recovery \u2013&nbsp;and re-election</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The virus has had a devastating effect in communities across the US as hospital systems have become overwhelmed and struggled to get proper protective equipment and ventilators to help patients with the most serious cases.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/coronavirus-daily-us-deaths-models-trump-report\">report</a> thought to be from the White House (though the White House has denied ownership) said daily coronavirus deaths could reach 3,000 in the US by 1 June. The US is currently seeing between 1,000 and 2,000 deaths and between 20,000 and 30,000 new cases a day.</p> \n<h2>What effect has Covid-19 had on the US economy?</h2> \n<p>A majority of states issued stay-at-home orders, allowing only essential workers to go to work and keep their businesses open. This has resulted in a wave of unemployment throughout the US: more than 22 million people have<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/16/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economic-toll-jobless\"> filed for unemployment</a> since the crisis began, a number likely to rise as states work through the backlog of applications.</p> \n<p>Industries such as restaurants and travel have been decimated by shutdown orders with uncertainty over when, if ever, business will return to normal. Congress has passed a series of spending bills, the main one being a $2.2tn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">stimulus package</a> in March, to try to mitigate the harm the virus has had on industries, hospitals and local governments.</p> \n<p>As the economic fallout worsened, Trump has encouraged states to reopen, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-its-safe-to-reopen-states-as-governors-grapple-with-loosening-restrictions/2020/05/03/013ee34a-8d64-11ea-a0bc-4e9ad4866d21_story.html\">insisting that it is safe while also acknowledging the death toll is set to rise</a>.

  "<p>Here\u2019s the bit Sir Richard Branson didn\u2019t mention in his open letter to Virgin employees a fortnight ago: the only possible route to the Treasury\u2019s wallet involves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/05/virgin-atlantic-to-close-gatwick-operations-and-lose-3000-workers\">almost a third of the 10,000 staff at the Virgin Atlantic losing their jobs</a>.</p> <p>The jobs decision hadn\u2019t been taken at the time but Branson could still have foreshadowed an obvious threat. Government ministers were never going to throw \u00a3500m of taxpayers\u2019 money, or some such sum, in Virgin Atlantic\u2019s direction unless they could see a vaguely credible plan to cut costs. The airline, remember, was loss-making even before the pandemic.</p> <p>As far it goes, the new boardroom thinking looks pragmatic. Unprofitable routes will be dropped, gas-guzzling and ancient 747s will be ditched and Gatwick will be abandoned as a base for the time being. It\u2019s tough on staff but the entire airline industry is acting similarly.</p> <p>The action plan, though, is very far from being a sufficient qualification for a bailout. The Treasury will not want to see Virgin Atlantic go bust, taking even more jobs with it, but, as Branson must know, the politics of a loan are appalling.</p> <p>He\u2019s a billionaire who lives in a tax haven and who has a liquid asset in the form of a $1.5bn stake in publicly traded Virgin Galactic; and the owner of the remaining 49% of Virgin Atlantic is Delta Air Lines, which can\u2019t contribute because the US government doesn\u2019t want a dime of its own bailout support to leak into foreign airlines.</p> <p>To even get a hearing in the Treasury, Branson will now have to recapitalise Virgin Atlantic. That could mean injecting cash himself or finding new investors \u2013 and the capital will have to be genuinely at risk. Then he will have to pledge to forgo the \u00a320m a year that Virgin Group is currently paid in brand fees, and persuade Delta to do similarly with its IT charge. He will then have to commit to financial transparency and, probably, offer an equity slice to the state.</p> <p>Its impossible to know if he\u2019s both willing and able to meet those demands, but they seem the minimum requirement for Treasury even to contemplate a loan or guarantee \u2013 and probably for a sum much smaller than the fantastical \u00a3500m. The process is harder than writing self-serving letters, but what did Branson expect?</p> <h2>Ocado investors are right to make a fuss over executive bonuses</h2> <p>Ocado these days is worth \u00a312bn, equivalent to the combined stock market values of Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons and Marks &amp; Spencer, which represents an astonishing shift in power in the food retailing industry.</p> <p>The big money in the food retail business, it turns out, lies not in selling groceries to shoppers, but in selling robots and clever delivery technology to grocers. Ocado\u2019s seven licensing deals with overseas retailers have transformed its prospects, and the pandemic has accelerated a process that was happening anyway.</p> <p>And, since the Ocado co-founder and chief executive, Tim Steiner, still owns 29m shares, his 4.2% stake is worth roughly \u00a3500m. Which raises the obvious question: why on the earth, back in 2014, did he require a side order of 4m freebie shares to encourage him to turn up for work?</p> <p>Those shares were the largest part of a \u201cgrowth incentive plan\u201d (GIP) that seems to have been created for no other reason than the management fancied a potentially juicer jackpot than could be generated by the regular long-term plan (which, naturally, they kept as well).</p> <p>The sole performance condition was to get the share price to improve faster than the FTSE 100 index over a five-year period, which was achieved in spades.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/05/ocado-shareholder-revolt-bonus-payout-royal-london\"> Last May Steiner\u2019s 4m GIP shares were worth \u00a354m and the company bought him out for cash</a>. Three other directors shared almost \u00a334m.</p> <p>Wednesday\u2019s vote on Ocado\u2019s remuneration report, which describes the final tallies, therefore comes long after the ship has sailed. Rebellion, one might say, is pointless, especially as 2014\u2019s shareholders approved the GIP at launch with the usual Putin-like majority of 83%.</p> <p>But, actually, it\u2019s still important that today\u2019s Ocado investors make a fuss. Steiner\u2019s \u00a354m payday is not as ludicrous as the \u00a375m that the housebuilder Persimmon showered on Jeff Fairburn, but the common element is the lack of a cap on the size of the reward.</p> <p>Such structures, fund managers keep telling us, are no longer acceptable. If they mean it, they should give a thumbs-down to Ocado\u2019s pay report. Steiner has created a brilliant business, but his GIP should never been proposed or approved.</p>",

Tom Harrison, the chief executive of the ECB, warned that English cricket could lose as much as \u00a3380m if there is no play this summer.</p> <p>\u201cWe are still working on impact of Covid-19 across the entire game, but we anticipate the cost of no cricket this year could be as bad as \u00a3380m across all of our professional clubs and the ECB,\u201d Harrison told MPs. \u201cThat is the worst-case scenario.\u201d</p> <p>There will be no professional cricket in England until at least 1 July and the Hundred, the governing body\u2019s flagship new competition, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/30/ecb-launch-the-hundred-pushed-back-2021-cricket\">has been postponed until 2021</a>. Harrison said he still hoped some international cricket would take place behind closed doors \u201cwith a following wind\u201d, including England\u2019s matches against West Indies, Australia, Pakistan and Ireland.</p> <p>However, he conceded: \u201cWe staring at a \u00a3100m-plus loss this year whatever happens. We are going to have to take a good look at our cost base \u2026 and cut our cloth accordingly. We have less money coming into the sport. It is the most significant financial challenge we have ever faced.\u201d</p> <p>The chairman of the English Football League, Rick Parry, painted a similarly bleak picture when he spoke to MPs, telling them the 71 lower league clubs were facing a \u00a3200m black hole by September.</p> <p>Parry said it was impossible to predict how many clubs could go under but was adamant English football would have to undergo huge changes, including a salary cap for players, to sustain itself in the years ahead.</p> <p>\u201cIn the Championship wages are 106% of turnover,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is ridiculous and it is definitely not sustainable now or in the future.

But Sweeney warned the RFU may end up needing a government bailout.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt is a very significant loss of revenue and we are doing what we can to mitigate it. If this was to be prolonged and go through into the next summer and the Six Nations games were impacted, then there would be a catastrophic impact on rugby union in England.\u201d</p> <p>In evidence to the MPs the Sport England chief executive, Tim Hollingsworth, stressed the impact the pandemic was having on grassroots sport and activity. One fact from Hollingsworth particularly cut through: that 44% of children are now doing no physical activity at all, or less than the 30 minutes recommended by the chief medical officer since the crisis began. That is up from a third before the lockdown began.</p>",
  "<p>\u2018Can all of us be in the same room at the same time?,\u201d Jeremy Pope asks over the phone from his home in Los Angeles. It is over a month into lockdown, but he isn\u2019t questioning the rules of physical distancing. Rather, the 27-year-old is pondering the unspoken rules of Hollywood prejudice \u2013 who gets to share a platform with whom, and whether there\u2019s only space for one minority figure at any given time.</p> <p>Pope\u2019s latest project \u2013 his first major TV role \u2013 is in Ryan Murphy\u2019s new Netflix series Hollywood, a revisionist story set in 1940s Golden Age tinseltown, where he plays Archie, a gay, black screenwriter who is trying to break into the industry. It is a story he could relate to.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s brilliant about our series is that you have a powerful man like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/26/ryan-murphy-american-horror-story-pose-politician-glee-nip-tuck\">Ryan Murphy</a> who is capable of making any type of TV he wants, and then he makes a show like this \u2013 showing the world what it could have been,\u201d Pope says. \u201cAnd I am what it can be, he\u2019s given me my debut TV opportunity. I often feel very similar to Archie and I wonder: is there room for another black man like me?\u201d</p> <p>Hollywood is a lascivious, lustful take on a much-mythologised era, centred on a group of fledgling stars: Pope\u2019s Archie, whose retelling of Peg Entwistle\u2019s suicide is picked up by director Raymond (Darren Criss), and actors Jack (David Corenswet) and Camille (Laura Harrier). Criss and Corenswet are established actors of the Murphy stable, having starred in his previous productions such as Glee, The Politician and The Assassination of Gianni Versace, yet for Pope, Hollywood \u2013 the show and the town \u2013 was an unfamiliar experience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30913f9fc673462e5d9848346a230f2de2634f8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30913f9fc673462e5d9848346a230f2de2634f8e/0_0_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I was really excited about this story\u2019 ...

Both performances earned Pope Tony nominations, making him only the sixth person in its 73-year history to be up for two awards in one season.</p> <p>When he was offered the role of Archie, it was for an \u201cuntitled Ryan Murphy project\u201d and he had no idea what it would entail. \u201cWhen I met Ryan, we just had a great open dialogue about the show and it was a very collaborative process,\u201d he says. \u201cI soon became really excited about this story and representing a powerful black gay writer in the 1940s, but I needed to be reassured that there were directors and writers that represented me on the show, too.\u201d</p> <p>That support namely came in the form of longtime Murphy collaborator and Hollywood co-writer and co-director Janet Mock. \u201cJanet was my ride or die,\u201d he says. \u201cWe got to really dig into these characters and talk about the racial acrobatics these people had to go through. We know how hard it must have been to just be a coloured man in the 40s but then to also be an out gay man? It\u2019s like you already walk into a room with two strikes.\u201d</p> <p>Archie\u2019s scenes in the show are often highly demanding and emotional, tearfully confronting studio executives who seek to erase his experience or demanding recognition in the face of prejudice and privilege, yet Pope found it disconcertingly easy to tap into his narrative. \u201cDoing eight shows a week in theatre means I can deliver that intensity once, or eight times or even 12 \u2013 I can bring that discipline,\u201d he says, \u201cbut even more than that, with these scenes I would just think about people like Hattie McDaniel, who was the first woman of colour to win an Academy award. But she wasn\u2019t allowed in the ceremony and when she did win, the Academy had written a speech for her. So, I would feel the pain that she had to go through to be a beacon of light for people like me. It\u2019s so heartbreaking and it made me ask just how high am I allowed to dream?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b71a604032253f6afa7b5c5d08bc8e777e323c2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b71a604032253f6afa7b5c5d08bc8e777e323c2d/0_0_3094_1857/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018She was my ride or die\u2019 ...

I just hope that this show continues to inspire our generation of artists to keep fighting to establish that there is room for all of us.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, Pope is spending his lockdown with a well-deserved break from the rigours of filming, \u201cmaking music, writing and learning how to bake my grandmother\u2019s pound cake\u201d. \u201cIn these past couple of weeks I\u2019ve just been able to think of all the moments we\u2019ve had thus far and how great they have been,\u201d he says \u2013 taking in the entirety of his community into his third person \u201cwe\u201d. \u201cI know that when I get back to work, we will be on that mission just as aggressively as we were before.\u201d</p> <p><em>Hollywood is available on Netflix now</em></p>",
  "<p>There is a word that Des Buckingham, during almost six years working in New Zealand, has used as a mantra to live by. In the Maori language, <em>Mana</em> represents a spiritual essence that almost defies translation but in everyday use it broadly applies thus: a way of holding oneself through dignity, respect, humanity and authority.</p> <p>It has been invaluable over the past five days because Buckingham is navigating one of the biggest disappointments of a young coaching career that, since he moved to the other side of the world after leaving Oxford United in 2014, had rarely let up.</p> <p>When his New Zealand Under-23 side qualified for the Olympic Games last October he expected to be leading them to Tokyo 2020 nine months later. The Covid-19 crisis put that on hold and then the dream was snatched away completely: last Thursday NZ Football confirmed it would not extend his contract beyond August \u2013 effectively making him redundant now \u2013 and that a restructuring would see the senior coach, Danny Hay, take the team to Tokyo next year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/05/shorter-games-under-consideration-for-footballs-return-says-pfa-chief-gordon-taylor-not-45-minutes-each-way\">Shorter games under consideration for football's return, says PFA chief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou just have to reflect on a really enjoyable and successful time with some really memorable and historic moments,\u201d Buckingham says. \u201cThe decision\u2019s not going to change. My staff and I have never been ones to shout from the rooftops, whether things are going well or not.\u201d</p> <p>The hurt is still raw but he has only good words to offer about his former employers, even though plenty in his orbit have expressed their views strongly. Speculation over his future had rumbled to the extent that last month a group of 24 players wrote to NZ Football requesting Buckingham and his <em>Whanau</em> (family) be kept together. It was not heeded and last week\u2019s news is understood to have gone down particularly poorly among a squad whose fortunes he had turned around.</p> <p>That comes as little surprise on examining Buckingham\u2019s record. He first came to global attention when New Zealand performed superbly at last year\u2019s Under-20 World Cup in Poland, edged out on penalties by Colombia in the last 16 but equalling the country\u2019s best run at a Fifa event. They did it in style, bucking the image of Kiwi footballers as honest-but-dull grafters with a slick, often scintillating, attacking approach.</p> <p>\u201cBefore the tournament we were a team that, across the last decade, was always outpassed, outshot and outscored,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019d won two games in 10 years. So we wanted to agree on a way of playing and showcase exactly what New Zealand players could do on the world stage. I said to them: \u2018Let\u2019s go there with belief and play the way we think we can, even if we lose all three games.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Buckingham put together a document that looked to fuse his playing philosophy with other attributes \u2013\u201ca never-say-die attitude, a humbleness, no egos, a really open people who are receptive to new ideas and putting others first\u201d \u2013 he perceived in a New Zealand player. His side lost once in open play during the tournament, Uruguay winning what was essentially a dead rubber. Honduras were beaten 5-0 and a Norway team featuring Erling Braut Haaland were defeated 2-0.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79c9b227e358e446bcf0181aeb8d4fcc687e9e74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79c9b227e358e446bcf0181aeb8d4fcc687e9e74/0_101_4061_2436/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarpreet Singh, pictured here during a Bayern Munich training session in April, was part of the New Zealand side at the Under-20 World Cup.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarpreet Singh, pictured during a Bayern Munich training session in April, was part of the New Zealand side at the Under-20 World Cup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sebastian Widmann/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Bayern Munich midfielder Sarpreet Singh was influential and so was Liberato Cacace, a 19-year-old left-back with explosive attacking potential tipped for a move to Europe. The shootout against Colombia was, in Buckingham\u2019s words, \u201cdevastating\u201d because they felt so close to a push for the latter stages. But the point had been made: Kiwi footballers could get it down and play with the best.</p> <p>\u201cWe absolutely flipped it on its head,\u201d he says. \u201cThe playing style was totally different. We were outpassing teams, outshooting them, and reduced opportunities on our goal by a third. Some of the football we played was a pleasure to watch.\u201d</p> <p>He had been combining the under-20s role with the seniors\u2019 assistant manager position but was then tasked with overseeing the Olympic qualification, which was earned via New Zealand\u2019s first football gold medal at a Pacific Games. In a less troubled world that would have been the springboard to his proudest moment yet but joy can still be found in a journey he had never foreseen.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a bit of a jump but if I hadn\u2019t taken it I\u2019d have always looked back and wondered,\u201d he says of the 12,000-mile journey from Oxford to Wellington. \u201cI can\u2019t describe why, but it felt right.\u201d</p> <p>He had spent a decade with his local club, starting as an academy coach after his ambitions as a goalkeeper in the youth team fizzled out and becoming part of Chris Wilder\u2019s first-team staff at the age of 29. Wilder and the long-serving Mickey Lewis were towering influences; much earlier Brendan Rodgers had been one, too, during a spell playing for Reading\u2019s youth setup.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c49134041a333ee387899bc25ca6b3dfc6b5e2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c49134041a333ee387899bc25ca6b3dfc6b5e2e/0_47_2404_1443/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Des Buckingham has no regrets over moving to New Zealand. \u2018If I hadn\u2019t taken it I\u2019d have always looked back and wondered.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Des Buckingham has no regrets over moving to New Zealand: \u2018If I hadn\u2019t taken it I\u2019d have always looked back and wondered.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TF-Images/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So a move to Wellington Phoenix, the only New Zealand club to play in the Australian A-League, took him far from any comfort zone. \u201cMy last game at Oxford was a 12,000 sellout at the Kassam and Dave Kitson had just risen to score the winner,\u201d he says. \u201cI arrived in New Zealand and the first game I went to watch was played to a capacity of 450. Getting on a plane for a few hours to every away game took some adjustment too. But it didn\u2019t take long and the football was of a good standard.\u201d</p> <p>Buckingham was recruited as Phoenix\u2019s assistant but ended up becoming the youngest head coach in A-League history, taking over for six months in early 2017 and steering them away from the bottom of the table. A brief return to England ensued with Stoke\u2019s Under-23s \u2013 he worked under Mark Hughes and Paul Lambert \u2013 but then NZ Football came calling with the under-20 position.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how many experiences you get like that in a lifetime,\u201d he says. Once the frustration and, perhaps more pertinently, the country\u2019s lockdown have eased he will look to supplement them, although it will be a wrench to leave.</p> <p>In theory he could take off all by himself: Buckingham received a trial flight with an instructor for his 30<sup>th</sup> birthday five years ago and one thing led to another. Six theory exams and innumerable hours later he emerged with a pilot\u2019s licence for craft of 24 seats or below; his father visited recently and turned a shade or two of green as Buckingham flew him over the breathtaking Marlborough Sounds coastline.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As hobbies go it takes some beating but he hopes a new challenge in football will be consuming him soon. Another motto from his adopted home helps him make sense of what has passed.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s an All Blacks saying about leaving things in a better place than when you found them,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that, from when we picked it up until now, it\u2019s in a far better place in terms of results, performances and culture across both teams.</p> <p>\u201cI hope they continue to go on and do what I think they can, achieving some more special things for New Zealand.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Downing Street\u2019s scientific advisers feared people might intentionally seek to contract coronavirus and that a black market in fake test results could emerge if employers allowed workers to return only when they had a positive antibody test.</p> \n<p>The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, known as Sage, was warned last month by its behavioural psychology subgroup that the widespread introduction of antibody tests could lead to a range of potentially dangerous and even criminal \u201cnegative behavioural responses\u201d if not handled well.</p> \n<p>The warning, discussed by Sage on 14 April, is among a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/scientific-advisory-group-for-emergencies-sage-coronavirus-covid-19-response\">tranche of official documents</a> released on Tuesday as part of the government\u2019s efforts to be more transparent about the advisory groups and the scientific basis for the advice they are giving ministers.</p> \n<p>The papers show that:</p> \n<p>\u2022 On 4 February, Sage estimated the size of the outbreak in China to be \u201cat least 10 times higher\u201d than the official number of confirmed cases.</p> \n<p>\u2022 On 3 March, as Boris Johnson described how he \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/how-coronavirus-advice-from-boris-johnson-has-changed\">shook hands with everybody</a>\u201d on a hospital visit, a Sage subgroup said ministers should advise against greetings \u201csuch as shaking hands and hugging\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u2022 On 23 March, the day of the lockdown, Sage discussed how \u201chard-hitting\u201d emotional messaging could be needed to make complacent people feel at risk.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Modelling discussed on 23 March predicted London\u2019s intensive care unit capacity would be breached by the end of the month. The rapid rise of admissions to intensive care units meant a reproductive rate, R, of more than 3 could not be ruled out.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Easing the lockdown must be done extremely carefully and that a \u201ctraffic light system\u201d could help people understand what activities were high or low risk. </p> \n<p>Antibody tests are expected to become available in the UK within the next month, but their value is still under debate. While most people who recover from Covid-19 are expected to have antibodies to the virus, it is unclear how protective they will be, and how long any protection will last, making many scientists cautious about \u201cimmunity passports\u201d</p> \n<p>Experts on the scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviours, Spi-B, which feeds into Sage, explained in April that pre-emptive measures were needed to prevent a range of undesirable outcomes when antibody tests became available.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"82beeb58-e861-4575-90dd-2b879d1a3a65\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/uk-to-start-coronavirus-contact-tracing-again\">Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic</a>&nbsp;like the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;says it should be the \u201cbackbone of the response\u201d in every country.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The group described how people who tested positive might get sloppy with hand hygiene and contribute to the spread of the virus, or put themselves forward for jobs that exposed them to infectious people, a particular concern if the test result was faulty.</p> \n<p>The experts went on to warn that employers might discriminate against staff on the basis of their antibody tests and that if a positive test was needed to return to work, people might \u201cgame\u201d the system and deliberately seek infection or try and buy fake test results.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A second paper from the Spi-B experts warns that any attempt to cycle between periods of lockdown and easing would need to be explained extremely carefully to the public. After months of lockdown, people might assume that any easing of the restrictions meant the risk of infection had gone away. If infections then picked up and further lockdown was ordered, it was \u201clikely to be seen as a serious failure of policy and trust in public health advice will be lost\u201d.</p> \n<p>The documents do not provide complete transparency about the Sage group\u2019s deliberations, however. The four-page paper from the Spi-B group on easing the lockdown includes more than a page of redacted material.</p> \n<p>Other papers reveal that the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium, a group of geneticists charged with understanding the epidemic, swiftly identified 12 lineages of the virus in March, consistent with the virus being imported to the UK from Europe and \u201cmultiple locations around the world\u201d.</p> \n<p>A further Sage paper agreed that stopping or reducing public transport would have a \u201cminimal effect\u201d on slowing the spread of the virus. Concerns that a London lockdown would lead to people leaving the city and spreading the virus elsewhere were dismissed because infections were already present outside the capital.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>On the day of the nationwide lockdown, 23 March, Sage considered a raft of measures that might be needed to ensure people complied with strict social distancing and the stay-at-home policy. It raised the prospect of new legislation to enforce social distancing and warned that people who were \u201ccomplacent\u201d about the virus needed to feel an increased level of \u201cpersonal threat\u201d which could be achieved using \u201chard-hitting emotional messaging.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked about the redacted material, a government spokesperson said: \u201cThe only redactions relate to comments made by a SAGE sub-group on the early development of policy still under consideration or to remove contact details. Redactions were carried out by officials working for the Government Office for Science in consultation with the department developing the policy.\u201d</p> \n<p><br></p>",
  "<p>Rare is the NFL draft that provokes second guessing about a kicker. But this year\u2019s edition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/24/nfl-virtual-draft-television-abc-espn\">was no ordinary draft</a> (see: 19, Covid.) And Justin Rohrwasser is no ordinary kicker.</p> <p>When the New England Patriots selected Rohrwasser in the fifth round to replace the legendary Stephen Gostkowski, it was a shock, especially as the 23-year-old hadn\u2019t been considered an exceptional talent in college. ESPN host Trey Wingo was even forced to admit on live TV that the Worldwide Leader in Sports had no highlights of Rohrwasser\u2019s career.</p> <p>And even if there had been any B-roll of a weather-beaten Rohrwasser blasting three-pointers against Rice or Western Kentucky, none of those images could eclipse the more striking one on his left forearm \u2013 of the Roman numeral III ringed in 13 stars. To the untrained eye, the tattoo would seem little more than a marker of youth. To the keener observer, it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/25/justin-rohrwasser-new-england-patriots-kicker-tattoo-three-percenters-nfl-draft\">the unmistakable brand of the Three Percenters</a> \u2013 a far-right paramilitary group that champions gun ownership and resists federal involvement in local matters. Formed in reaction to the 2008 election of Barack Obama, some members of the group took up arms and served as sentries for white supremacist protesters at the 2017 domestic terror attack in Charlottesville, that resulted in 28 injuries and one death.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/06/nick-bosa-donald-trump-san-francisco-49ers-nfl-draft\">If athletes like Nick Bosa support Trump they should at least be honest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rohrwasser, who can be clearly seen exercising his right to bare arms in official team photos, has played the na\u00eff. He told reporters that draft night was the first time he\u2019d heard about the significance of his tattoo, which he says he mistook for a US military symbol. He pledged to ink over it, then promised to laser it off entirely, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/28/justin-rohrwasser-tattoo-new-england-patriots-three-percenters\">all the while apologizing to friends and family</a> whom he\u2019d put in the \u201ccompromising position\u201d of having to defend the indefensible.</p> <p>Those attempts at damage control might have sailed through the uprights if he hadn\u2019t followed and \u201cliked\u201d so much far-right social media content. Or recommended books from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/07/how-dangerous-is-jordan-b-peterson-the-rightwing-professor-who-hit-a-hornets-nest\">Jordan Peterson</a> and other radical traditionalists. Or previously bragged about tattooing himself with a sewing needle. Or completely ignored the much bigger tattoo just under his Three Percenters dog whistle that reads \u201cLiberty or Death\u201d. That\u2019s the cry that was last heard by the anti-government protesters who\u2019d sooner drive down to the local statehouse with their guns and exhaust in a policeman\u2019s face than let something as trifling as global pandemic deny them the right to a haircut and a mani-pedi. Michigan governor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/michigan-gretchen-whitmer-lockdown-protest-racism\">Gretchen Whitmer said the demonstrations</a> at her state capitol \u2013 which, among other things, featured armed militia men waving Dixie flags and nooses \u2013 brought back memories of \u201csome of the worst racism and awful parts of our history in this country.\u201d</p> <p>So profound is the remorse in Rohrwasser\u2019s heart that he apparently spent a portion of what should have been the happiest day of his life crying in his car, according to an anecdote his high-school coach <a href=\"https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/05/04/patriots-kicker-justin-rohrwasser-broke-down-crying-tattoo-controversy/\">shared with the Boston Globe</a>. And, shoot, you had to feel for him. Pro football makes it so easy to summon the sympathy. When white players like Rohrwasser get whistled for their supremacist taunts, somehow, they\u2019re the ones who are forgiven. It was true when Carolina Panthers quarterback Kerry Collins used a racial epithet to refer to black and Hispanic teammates. (<a href=\"https://www.thebiglead.com/posts/kerry-collins-used-the-n-word-at-training-camp-while-drunk-with-carolina-teammates-in-1997-a-year-later-he-was-gone-to-new-orleans-01dxggp6jweh\">He blamed it on the alcohol</a>.) It was true when Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Riley Cooper was caught on tape threatening to jump a security barrier at a Kenny Chesney concert and <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1723166-riley-cooper-caught-on-tape-saying-racial-slur-at-concert\">\u201cfight every nigger here.\u201d</a> (He blamed it on the alcohol, too.) And it was true when Richie Incognito <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/04/richie-incognito-leave-miami-what-next-dolphins\">bullied his teammate Jonathan Martin</a> \u2013 \u201ca half-nigger piece of shit,\u201d in Incognito\u2019s estimation \u2013 out of the NFL. While Incognito resumed a career to which he\u2019s felt very much entitled, Martin has spent the five years wrestling with his mental health. Collins, Cooper and Incognito all carried on their careers in the NFL, as will Rohrwasser. You could argue that everyone deserves a second chance. Protest about the racism inherent in the US though, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/24/colin-kaepernick-nfl-workout-teams-response-interest\">you may well find your football career is over</a>.

We get an ESPN box on Clemson wideout Tee Higgins that ends <a href=\"https://www.cincyjungle.com/2020/4/28/21238980/bengals-espn-tee-higgins-mother-clemson-tigers-football\">with a bullet point</a> about his mom fighting drug addiction for 16 years. We get another bullet in the box on Colorado receiver Laviska Shenault Jr about his mother surviving West Nile virus. We get yet another bullet in the box on Alabama cornerback Trevon Diggs about his father dying of heart failure. It\u2019s enough to make you wonder where the bullet point about all the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/25/nick-bosa-nfl-draft-san-francisco-49ers-colin-kaepernick\">racist and homophobic posts Nick Bosa had liked</a> (and subsequently deleted) before he was taken second overall in last year\u2019s draft.</p> <p>For a shop run by Jimmy Pitaro \u2013 the politically averse ESPN president who has promised, on more than a few occasions, to deliver content that sticks to sports \u2013 these digressions are quite far afield indeed. What\u2019s more, every year his network seems to come into the draft with an endless supply of these backstories. (Maybe someday one of the 12,000 draft analysts in ESPN\u2019s employ will find the courage to weigh in.) It\u2019s almost as if there is a stubborn social construct in America that makes it virtually impossible for black athletes to escape the traumatic beats in their humble beginnings. </p> <p>If ever there was a team owner in the league who might appreciate the irony at work here, it\u2019s the Patriots\u2019 Robert Kraft. Here, after all, is a man who not only works with Meek Mill and Jay-Z on criminal justice reform, but also gives liberally to Blue Lives causes, supports the troops and first responders<strong> </strong>and counts our law-and-order president among his closest friends. How does a guy like Kraft wind up drafting a guy like Rohrwasser? Easy. His team had a need, and his coach saw something. With a bit of laser removal and a few clutch kicks, likely, Rohrwasser will soon reduce the breathless stories about his rightward leanings to a \u201cWest Nile\u201d-sized poverty porn bullet. The most people will remember is that he was called out for his extremist affiliations, he wept. As long as Rohrwasser plays the victim, he can never lose.</p>"
