  "<p>Formula One is looking at using a reversed grid qualifying session as part of a new format for racing\u2019s resumption this season. Formula One Group has already discussed the proposal with the teams and the governing body, the FIA, and it is understood it has broad support but that the world champions, Mercedes, oppose the concept. A formal vote and decision will be made early this week.</p> <p>F1\u2019s proposal is specifically targeted at events where one circuit would host two races. The sport is expected to announce the European leg of its rescheduled calendar on Monday. It will open with two back-to-back races at the Red Bull Ring in Austria and is also set to include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/28/silverstone-set-to-host-back-to-back-f1-races-in-august\">two races at Silverstone</a>, subject to coronavirus restrictions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/31/lewis-hamilton-condemns-silence-from-f1-paddock-over-george-floyd-killing\">Lewis Hamilton attacks silence from F1 paddock over George Floyd killing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The intent is to enliven interest in the second race taking place within seven days at the same venue, with broadcasters understood to be concerned at a potential drop in interest in identical races. The format would feature a standard race weekend for the first meeting. On the following Saturday a 30-minute race with a grid ordered in reverse championship standings would be held to decide qualifying positions for the second race.</p> <p>F1 believes the concept would distinguish the second race from the first and is likely to present a far more varied grid. A detailed proposal has been sent to team principals. For it to be adopted all 10 teams would have to agree and they will vote this week. A majority including Ferrari are believed to support it.</p> <p>However Mercedes and one other team opposed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/24/ferrari-f1-formula-one-gimmicks-singapore-grand-prix\">similar plan last year</a> when F1 put forward a reverse grid format for trial in 2020. Mercedes\u2019 position is understood to be unchanged. They opposed it on the basis that it was an artificial imposition that went against the spirit of F1.&nbsp;\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at the 100m final in the Olympics, you\u2019re not making Usain Bolt start five metres behind just to make it an exciting finish,\u201d said their team principal,&nbsp;Toto Wolff, last October.</p> <p>Lewis&nbsp;Hamilton&nbsp;also&nbsp;dismissed the idea&nbsp;last year.&nbsp;\u201cPeople who propose that don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d&nbsp;the six-times world champion&nbsp;and Mercedes driver said.&nbsp;\u201cThe fact that now they are trying the reverse grid and all that feels like an excuse for not doing a good enough job.\u201d If Mercedes remain&nbsp;opposed the&nbsp;format&nbsp;will not be adopted.</p>",
  "<p>It was 2011 when Rue Mapp was followed by a white woman in an Oakland, California, park, while out on a national campaign to get local families connected with nature. </p> <p>The woman had spotted the group en route to the park and decided to follow them. When they got off the bus, she followed them all the way through the park, and when they began to play in the dirt, she started to harass them. She claimed they were bringing \u201cinvasive species\u201d into the park.</p> <p>\u201cThe kids around me might have rightly been thinking, \u2018Is she talking about us?\u2019\u201d says Rue, who is black.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>She says the incident brought \u201cso many levels of shame, embarrassment and of not feeling welcome in nature\u201d.</p> <p>If that incident were filmed today, it would probably go viral, just as the harassment of Christian Cooper did this week. The video,<strong> </strong>circulated hundreds of thousands of times in the last week, shows Amy Cooper, a white woman calling the police on Cooper, an avid bird-watcher, after he<strong> </strong>asked her to put her dog on a leash in a popular bird-watching section of Central Park. \u201cI am going to call the police and tell them an African American man is threatening my life,\u201d she threatened.</p> <p>In the days after the video went viral, the woman lost her job and surrendered her dog \u2013 but many black people say that it is not an isolated incident.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a story beyond one person, a story beyond that park. It is a story writ large of who owns spaces, who has privileges to those spaces,\u201d says author and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/1blackbirder\">black birder</a> Drew Lanham.</p> <p>Lanham wrote an essay on <a href=\"https://orionmagazine.org/article/9-rules-for-the-black-birdwatcher/\">rules for the black birder</a> in 2013. \u201cYou\u2019re an endangered species \u2013 extinction looms.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>You know all the black birders like siblings and can count them on two hands. You\u2019re afraid to have lunch with them all because a single catastrophe could wipe the species from the face of the earth,\u201d reads <a href=\"https://orionmagazine.org/article/9-rules-for-the-black-birdwatcher/\">rule nine of the former set of rules</a>. </p> <p>Jason Ward, whose popular birdwatching series Birds of North America features Christian Cooper, decides to view the injustice the same way a bird would see the world: migrating through spaces, stopping at places that benefit them and passing over ones that offer them nothing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JoshuaPotash/status/1265338098256424973\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is Christian Cooper. <a href=\"https://t.co/gOQyVztX5h\">pic.twitter.com/gOQyVztX5h</a></p>&mdash; Joshua Potash (@JoshuaPotash) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoshuaPotash/status/1265338098256424973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 26, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>For Ward, the places where he can\u2019t stop look like rural parts of Georgia; anywhere with Confederate flags \u2013 and yes, sometimes big cities, too. His brother, also an avid birdwatcher, has had the police called on him while birdwatching in Central Park.</p> <p>\u201cIt is unfortunate that we as birders of color have to look over the world this way \u2026 But I don\u2019t want the cops called on me or to have an unpleasant interaction so I [often] think, \u2018let me cut this outing short and come back another time.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>These are defense mechanisms that Ward and many other black nature-lovers have to employ when out in the wild \u2013 lest a situation turn sticky and they have to answer questions from a suspecting police officer. In short, in a battle of he-said-she-said, most black people know who the burden of proof falls on.</p> <p>\u201cWhat Amy Cooper proved is what many black people already know: that it is not just people in police uniforms [who have power over us]. There are ordinary citizens who take the privilege of impunity and will weaponize it instantly against you. Part of white privilege is this ability to have your words believed before black people are believed,\u201d says Lanham.</p> <p>Mapp\u2019s own encounter with racism in that Oakland city park did not put her off, it emboldened her to create <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Outdoor+Afro&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS883US883&amp;oq=Outdoor+Afro&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l4j69i60l3.256j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">Outdoor Afro</a> \u2013 an organization which encourages black nature lovers into the outdoors in over 30 states.</p> <p>\u201cI am tired of the narrative of black bodies being harmed in nature and in the outdoors,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom a practical perspective, we all pay taxes on these public lands and so to enjoy them is an exercise of our citizenship. It is what being American is all about,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThe experience [in an Oakland Park] crystalized the importance of creating a community for black people who want to be in nature. Having groups of people, so we can feel protected and more resilient, has been part of our model from the very beginning,\u201d says Mapp. The worst thing that could come of the incident in Central Park this week, she says, is that black people are put off from exploring nature. African Americans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/23/national-parks-hiking-camping-outdoor-afro-boating\">make up</a> just 7% of pass-holders at national parks, while white people make up 78%.</p> <p>It has been argued that this unequal access is the product of unequal interest, but there is a long history of public lands spaces intentionally excluding black people, including through very concrete rules <a href=\"https://www.nationalparkstraveler.org/2019/08/how-national-park-service-grappled-segregation-during-20th-century\">which prevented black people from accessing public lands</a>.</p> <p>Lanham goes back to his nine rules to exemplify this. When he considers going on a specific trip, alongside weighing up the many universally good factors (nature\u2019s beauty) as well as the bad (the possibility that he will get stung by a wasp or step on an ants\u2019 nest), he also has to make other decisions, mostly based on his safety.<strong> </strong>\u201cI<strong> </strong>have to make decisions about where I go, when I go, who I go with, what people will be thinking of me when I am there. I need to make sure I am wearing the right thing, that my car registration is in the right place so when I am stopped, I am not suspected of harboring something,\u201d he says. \u201cI have some complex equation that I have to figure out several times a fucking day.\u201d</p> <p>Lanham was forced to do this math recently, and the numbers did not look good for him. A good friend, a white birder, called him to tell him about a sighting of a rare bird: the <a href=\"https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Connecticut_Warbler/id\">Connecticut </a><a href=\"https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Connecticut_Warbler/id\">warbler</a>. Lanham describes the bird as \u201cone of my [holy] grail birds\u201d. If there was a bird-ranking chart, Lanham says it would be \u201c9.5 out of 10 on the want-list for most birders\u201d.</p> <p>But the bird was sighted in a probably all-white neighborhood, where Lanham knew he might be viewed suspiciously, more likely to be considered \u201cloitering\u201d than \u201ccasually walking\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI said, maybe the two of us could meet up and go together. I didn\u2019t want to tell him \u2013 I didn\u2019t reveal to him my fear to him of being in this place, of just going there,\u201d says Lanham. \u201cNon-birders might say, what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d he muses. But that bird \u2013 which Lanham has only caught glimpses of \u2013 is one he would love to see.</p> <p>\u201cI want to go, to just sit and soak it up, but I can\u2019t because I am afraid of the unknown \u2013 not of nature\u2019s unknown, but of the unknown of what humans [might do to me],\u201d says Lanham. </p> <p>For Ward, that so many obstacles are placed in the way of being able to experience beauty is enraging and disheartening. But it is not discouraging.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I grew up, there was no one I knew in the natural world studying animals who looked like I did, at least not on television. And yet, still my love persisted,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI know that\u2019s changing now and there are people of color who are starting to make serious ground in these spaces. So for future generations I cannot afford to be knocked off track,\u201d he says.</p>",
  "<p>The circumstances surrounding the 29 May arrest of the CNN reporter Omar Jimenez couldn\u2019t be clearer, more obvious, less subject to doubt or debate.&nbsp;You need only watch the video of the incident to know: this is not fake news.</p> <p>In Minneapolis, Omar Jimenez was covering the protests ignited by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man killed by the police. Confronted by a phalanx of state policemen in riot gear, Jimenez offered to move back. \u201cWe\u2019re getting out of your way. Just let us know. Wherever you want us, we will go.\u201d He calmly identified himself as a CNN journalist and produced his credentials. Nonetheless, he was handcuffed and led away, as he continued to ask, peacefully and respectfully, why he was being arrested. Soon after, his producer and cameraman were also cuffed and marched off. One can hear the distraught cameraman asking what to do with his camera, which was seized by the police \u2013&nbsp;apparently unaware that it was still filming.</p> <p>What the camera doesn\u2019t show is that a few blocks away, a white journalist, also reporting for CNN, was treated by the police with consummate politeness. So what we see, and don\u2019t see, is the convergence of two profoundly toxic streams growing stronger and deeper as they continue to poison our society. One is the erosion of our first amendment protections \u2013&nbsp;Jimenez\u2019s right to document and describe what he was seeing is constitutionally guaranteed \u2013&nbsp;and the other is the systemic racism that explains why a black reporter was arrested while a white one was encouraged to do his job; why a Minneapolis police officer jammed his knee into George Floyd\u2019s neck for eight fatal minutes; and why, almost every week, another black person is killed by the police or \u2013 like Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery \u2013 by freelance white vigilantes.&nbsp;</p> <p>One shudders to think what might have happened to Jimenez, a black man in a tense confrontation with law enforcement, had he not been employed by CNN and accompanied by a camera crew.&nbsp;</p> <p>For many years, organizations such as PEN and the Committee to Protect Journalists have been working to safeguard the rights \u2013 and the lives \u2013 of writers and reporters around the world. Mostly, the arrests, imprisonments and murders of journalists have occurred in (and at the behest of) totalitarian regimes, and in countries in which the lawlessness of criminal cartels has gone largely unchecked. Among the most famous cases were the 2006 murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya outside her Moscow home and the 2018 killing of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul. In just the last two weeks, a Mexican reporter, Jorge Armenta, was murdered and the car of another journalist was firebombed in Sonora state. The silencing of journalists is the hallmark of the dictatorship and the mafia state; threats and violence are the tactics traditionally employed by the powerful and the corrupt to intimidate those who try to expose corruption and the abuses of power.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve watched our president deriding the press and encouraging his followers to put their faith in conspiracy theories rather than in facts</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But that was always somewhere else, happening to other people, and American exceptionalism allowed us to advocate for \u2013 and feel slightly removed from \u2013 the reporters attacked and imprisoned in other countries, on other continents. Meanwhile the assaults on freedom of speech and on those who try to exercise that freedom have edged closer and closer to home. We\u2019ve watched our president deriding the press and encouraging his followers to put their faith in conspiracy theories rather than in facts. We\u2019ve witnessed the relentlessness with which Donald Trump has attacked the media, we\u2019ve seen Trump and his enablers\u2019 unapologetic disregard for the truth and for those who work to discover and tell that truth. And we\u2019ve noted how Trump\u2019s covert and overt racism has essentially legitimized and encouraged violence against immigrants and people of color while exacerbating the hatred and bigotry that have always been endemic in our society. It was Donald Trump, after all, who referred to the protesters as \u201cthugs\u201d and who suggested that looters should be shot.&nbsp;</p> <p>Given all that, I suppose we shouldn\u2019t be so deeply surprised when a black reporter is handcuffed and arrested for the crime of doing his job. And yet we are. One of the most striking things about the video of Jimenez\u2019s arrest is the response of the CNN commentators watching the live feed from the newsroom, or whatever the pandemic equivalent of the newsroom is. One says, \u201cThat is an American television reporter being led away by police \u2026 I\u2019ve never seen anything like this \u2026 Having been in the middle of protests, I\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d The emphasis on <em>American</em> television reporter is significant as&nbsp;the commentator repeats, for a third time: I\u2019ve never seen anything like this.&nbsp;</p> <p>Well, one wants to say, now you have. It\u2019s our turn. It\u2019s happening here, right now. The climate has shifted \u2013 away from the assurances of the first amendment, away from the pretense of a color-blind, egalitarian society \u2013 and towards a moment when the arrest of a working journalist, a black journalist, is still startling, but dishearteningly foreseeable.&nbsp;</p> <p>Incidents like this will continue to happen, and perhaps get worse, unless we remain vigilant and make our outrage known. Omar Jimenez and his camera crew have been released from police custody. George Floyd\u2019s killer has been charged with manslaughter and third-degree murder, perhaps in part because the protesters and their supporters refused to keep quiet and let it go.&nbsp;We can\u2019t stop paying attention and, more important, <em>calling</em> attention to the importance of the free press and to the horrors of racism. The mistake was always to think that it can\u2019t happen here, because it can, it has and \u2013 unless we remain aware and <em>vocal</em> \u2013 it most certainly will again.</p> <ul> <li><p>Francine Prose is a novelist and the former president of PEN America</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p><strong>Weegm\u00fcller Scheurebe Trocken, Pfalz, Germany 2018 (from \u00a317.70, <a href=\"https://www.corkingwines.co.uk/\">corkingwines.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"https://www.strictlywine.co.uk/\">strictlywine.co.uk</a>)</strong> German winemakers are behind so many of the world\u2019s finest white wines. Many of them \u2013 the majority probably \u2013 are made from the country\u2019s most recognisable variety, riesling. But there\u2019s much to love for those many wine drinkers who for some reason are allergic to riesling\u2019s sharp, quicksilver charms. One very underrated variety is scheurebe, a prejudice, perhaps, borne of the variety\u2019s origins: while riesling has a pedigree going back to the middle ages, scheurebe emerged from a grape-breeding institute, the work of one Dr Georg Scheu, in 1916. A century on, there isn\u2019t all that much about (1,400 hectares or so to riesling\u2019s 24,000ha), but what there is can make some delightful wines. Weegm\u00fcller\u2019s dry white from the Pfalz, the south western German region where scheurebe is at its best, shows off the characteristics that can make it such a pleasure: intensely, clean and pure grapefruit and orange citrus with a seasoning of peppery spice.</p> <p><strong>Horst Sauer Escherndorfer Lump Silvaner S Trocken, Franken, Germany 2018 (\u00a319.49,<a href=\"https://www.rannochscott.co.uk/index.html\"> rannochscott.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"https://cellarselected.com/\">cellarselected.com</a>)</strong> During the 20th century, scheurebe also made its way west from the Pfalz to the Franconia or Franken region, an historic German wine producing zone that has been somewhat overshadowed in recent years by the famed riesling havens further north in the Rheingau and Mosel. At the Wirsching estate, they\u2019ve had scheurebe since 1952, and the old vines (\u201calte reben\u201d) used for their Wirsching Iph\u00f6fer Kronsberg Scheurebe Alte Reben Trocken 2017 (\u00a325.35, <a href=\"https://thewinebarn.co.uk/\">thewinebarn.co.uk</a>) make for a gorgeously rich dry wine with that racy grapefruit tang underpinning fleshy peachy and tropical fruit. Franken is actually better known for another white variety beginning with S. A wine of subtle charms rather than big fruit flavour, top quality Silvaner like Horst Sauer\u2019s example from one of the best vineyard sites for the variety near Wurzburg, has a gentle blossomy prettiness and a springtime river raciness all its own.</p> <p><strong>Dr L Grey Slate Riesling, Mosel, Germany 2018 (\u00a37.49, <a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/\">Waitrose</a>)</strong> As good as silvaner and scheurebe can be, riesling remains the most versatile and endlessly fascinating of Germany\u2019s white grape varieties. There is something irresistibly, irrepressibly vibrant and refreshing, light-feeling yet full of flavour in a modern dry style such as Bibo Runge Debutant Dry Riesling 2018 from the Rheingau (\u00a317.95, <a href=\"https://www.southdownscellars.co.uk/\">southdowncellars.co.uk</a>), with its overlapping waves of exotic fruit and jangling acidity. The slightly sweet, verging on medium dry style is also particularly appealing at this time of year, with that little tickle of sugar only just noticeable thanks to the balancing acidity, but meaning it matches Thai or Vietnamese herbs and spicing, as well as a punnet of strawberries. Those qualities are on display in two Mosel wines from the consistently good Loosen family on offer at Waitrose until Monday: the Dr L Slate Riesling and the superbly spicy yet graceful Dr Loosen \u00dcrziger W\u00fcrzgarten Riesling Kabinett 2018 (\u00a311.99).</p> <p><em>Follow David on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveydaibach?lang=en\">@Daveydaibach</a></em></p>",
