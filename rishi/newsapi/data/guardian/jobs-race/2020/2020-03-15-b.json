The odds are mounting that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\" title=\"\">US Federal Reserve</a> will slash interest rates on Wednesday, following its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/mark-carney-tells-g7-bank-of-england-will-give-necessary-coronavirus-support\" title=\"\">emergency cut</a> in borrowing costs earlier this month.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve not heard the last from the Bank of England.

Some expect the Bank to cut the cost of borrowing close to zero when its rate-setting monetary policy committee meets on 26 March under the new governor\u2019s command. Last week, the central bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-bank-of-england-makes-emergency-interest-rate-cut\" title=\"\">cut interest rates from 0.75% to 0.25%</a> in its first emergency cut since the financial crisis, as part of a coordinated intervention alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/key-points-from-budget-2020-at-a-glance\" title=\"\">Rishi Sunak\u2019s first budget as chancellor</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve not heard the last from the Bank of England,\u201d said George Buckley, chief European economist at the Japanese bank Nomura. \u201cMuch will depend on the speed with which the virus and economic fallout progresses.\u201d</p> <p>He acknowledged that another cut could come on 26 March. \u201cOur central case, however, is that March may prove too soon, May might be too late, and that another emergency meeting will be required to deliver these measures some time in April.\u201d</p> <p>Drawing on 30-plus years at the Bank, and having known and worked closely with the last four governors in various roles, Bailey is viewed as a safe pair of hands. However, given the troubled times, the chair of the Commons Treasury committee, Mel Stride, has questioned whether someone more dextrous might be a better fit to replace Carney. After all, Bailey was rumoured not to be the preferred<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/20/choosing-safe-hands-bailey-suggests-pm-less-than-upbeat-over-brexit\" title=\"\"> candidate of Boris Johnson</a>, and the man who hired Bailey \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sajid-javid\" title=\"\">Sajid Javid</a> \u2013 is no longer chancellor.</p> <p>Under scrutiny against the backdrop of a crisis, Bailey responded by saying he helped oversee the 2008 bailout of the financial sector, and had been far from sluggish then. \u201cI think I can say that I have quite a strong history of doing things very quickly and of having to change course very quickly,\u201d he told Stride at a hearing of the Treasury committee.</p> <p>In the longer term, the new governor will need to continue Mark Carney\u2019s work to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/17/mark-carney-tells-global-banks-they-cannot-ignore-climate-change-dangers\" title=\"\">tackle the fallout from the climate emergency</a>. The task of steering Britain through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit</a> without unsettling the economy and upsetting the financial system will also be key later in the year, as talks with Brussels over the future UK-EU relationship intensify.</p>"
