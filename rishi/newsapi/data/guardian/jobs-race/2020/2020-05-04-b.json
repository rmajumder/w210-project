given a century-old <strong>tuberculosis vaccine</strong> on Monday in a trial to see whether the venerable formula can protect against coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>Devised at France\u2019s legendary Pasteur Institute 100 years ago, the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is one of the world\u2019s oldest and most trusted immunisations. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe vaccinated the first participant this morning,\u201d Duncan McDonald, head of business development and marketing at a clinical research organisation called TASK, told AFP. </p> \n  <p>Trials started at Tygerberg hospital in Cape Town, where BCG booster shots were administered to 250 health care workers, while another 250 received a dummy formula, or placebo. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThere are observations that this BCG vaccine does something to the immune system that we don\u2019t really understand,\u201d TASK founder professor, Andreas Diacon, said. </p> \n  <p>Children immunised with BCG tend to suffer less from respiratory illnesses, including asthma, he said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt makes the immune system cope better with respiratory retract infections,\u201d said Diacon. \u201cNo one actually really understands why it works.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Diacon and his team want to determine whether BCG could have an effect on coronavirus by reducing the risk of infection or easing symptoms. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIf you can reduce the (Covid-19) symptoms just a little, you will probably get people to survive this better or not even have to go to hospital or not even becoming ill,\u201d said Diacon. </p> \n  <p>The plan is to ramp up the trials to up to 3,000 health care workers in Cape Town.

Beijing faces a rising wave of hostility in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak that could tip relations with the <strong>United States</strong> into confrontation, Reuters reports. </p> \n  <p>The report, presented early last month by the ministry of state security to top Beijing leaders including president Xi Jinping, concluded that global anti-China sentiment is at its highest since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, sources said.</p> \n  <p>As a result, Beijing faces a wave of anti-China sentiment led by the US in the aftermath of the pandemic and needs to be prepared in a worst-case scenario for armed confrontation between the two global powers, according to people familiar with the report\u2019s content, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter. </p> \n  <p>The report was drawn up by the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR), a think tank affiliated with the ministry of state security, China\u2019s top intelligence body. </p> \n  <p>Reuters has not seen the briefing paper, but it was described by people who had direct knowledge of its findings. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have relevant information,\u201d the

request for comment. </p> \n  <p>Reuters couldn\u2019t determine to what extent the stark assessment described in the paper reflects positions held by China\u2019s state leaders, and to what extent, if at all, it would influence policy. </p> \n  <p>But the presentation of the report shows how seriously Beijing takes the threat of a building backlash that could threaten what China sees as its strategic investments overseas and its view of its security standing. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45ed20c14567af2d7a4bab3fbcf5b9519edba2fa\"> \n   <img

The orange departments will be declared red or green when a definitive map is published on Thursday. In any case, the French have been told not to make journeys of more than 100km without good professional or major family reasons after 11 May for the foreseeable future.</p> \n  <p>One of Macron\u2019s main objectives in ending the lockdown is to reopen the country\u2019s schools, but this is proving problematic. Nursery and primary schools will reopen classes on Tuesday, but with a maximum of between 10 and 15 pupils. The two lower years of secondary schools, will return the following Monday.</p> \n  <p>In Paris, City Hall estimates only 10% of nursery and primary school pupils will be able to return on Tuesday. The opening of classes is hampered because the city will almost certainly remain \u201cred\u201d on the coronavirus map and many city school buildings make it impossible to impose social distancing on youngsters. </p> \n  <p>Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo is among 334 mayors from the \u00cele de France region <a href=\"https://www.latribune.fr/opinions/tribunes/les-maires-d-ile-de-france-ne-porteront-pas-la-responsabilite-de-l-etat-dans-une-reouverture-des-ecoles-a-marche-forcee-846772.html\">who have written an open letter</a> to Macron asking for the reopening of schools to be postponed because of concerns over the potential health risk to children and teachers. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T10:15:45.330Z\">at 11.15am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eafdf328f087d47c7788df9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/samjones\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T09:30:31.692Z\">10.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For a second consecutive day, Spain\u2019s overnight coronavirus death toll has reached 164, according to the latest figures from the health ministry. </p> \n  <p>To date, there have been 218,011 confirmed cases in the country and 25,428 deaths.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eafde428f082b32fdd6ccd6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/juliakollewe\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T09:24:35.075Z\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The embattled carrier Norwegian Air has won support from aircraft lessors for its rescue plan as it faces a crunch shareholder vote on the $1.2bn (\u00a3950m) plan to convert debt into equity at an emergency meeting on Monday.</p> \n  <p>Norwegian\u2019s shareholder meeting got under way in Oslo on Monday morning, as the European Union\u2019s competition watchdog approved French state aid worth \u20ac7bn (\u00a36bn) for Air France.

Neither China nor the US attended the hastily assembled earlier summit, which also included the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>.</p> \n  <p>The US president, Donald Trump, who is at loggerheads with the WHO and China over what he has called a conspiracy to cover up the origin of the virus, had been urged to support the summit.

  "<h2>Top story: Staying at home inflates energy bills</h2> \n<p>Hello, it\u2019s Warren Murray disseminating Monday\u2019s news by various electronic means.</p> \n<p>More than a million renters in Britain risk losing their jobs in the coronavirus pandemic and should be protected from severe financial hardship by an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/04/call-for-freeze-on-all-uk-private-rents-to-help-1m-at-risk-workers-covid-19\">immediate rent freeze</a>, the New Economic Foundation thinktank is arguing. It identified the tenants as among 5.6 million who will miss out on the government\u2019s Covid-19 job retention scheme, due to having their hours cut, being made redundant rather than furloughed, or being ineligible for self-employed income protection. British households\u2019 energy bills are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/04/uk-household-energy-bills-to-soar-by-32-per-month\">set to rise by a third \u2013 \u00a332 per month on average</a> \u2013 because of people staying in lockdown and working from home.

His secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has, meanwhile, made confusing and muddled comments in which he said there was \u201cenormous evidence\u201d the virus came from a Chinese laboratory. \u201cLook, the best experts so far seem to think it was manmade,\u201d he said. But when reminded that US intelligence had issued a formal statement noting the scientific consensus \u2013 that the virus was not manmade or genetically modified \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-laboratory\">Pompeo replied: \u201cThat\u2019s right.
