They are also used within egg processing where the egg is broken into a liquid to be used for food manufacturers, hotel or restaurants.</p> <p>\u201cNone of our standard retail customers stock white eggs so we are really grateful to Tesco for stepping in as the white eggs would have gone to waste.\u201d</p> <p>The eggs will cost the same as the brown free-range equivalent, starting from 89p for a box of six medium eggs.</p> <p>Until the early 1970s white eggs \u2013 which are generally medium-sized \u2013 were popular in the UK but they had fallen out of favour by the end of the decade when shoppers began switching to the brown variety, which were larger and seen as healthier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a8b5eac3224e294b22137c1fb44048b25894f2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a8b5eac3224e294b22137c1fb44048b25894f2b/0_730_1732_1038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"white eggs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There are now relatively few white egg-laying flocks in the UK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tesco</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the 1980s, the UK industry has produced almost 100% brown shelled eggs for high street retailers. As a result there are now very few white egg-laying flocks in the UK; down to an estimated 250,000-300,000 of the 40m egg-laying birds in the UK.</p> <p>Tesco eggs buying manager Megan Kilby said: \u201cThe initial trial during the lockdown has been a success and we will now be stocking white free range eggs for the first time in more than 40 years. These eggs are used throughout the restaurant industry so shoppers can be assured of their quality.</p> <p>\u201cThe move could also have an agricultural benefit as white hens are more docile than brown ones and lay eggs for longer and more reliably.\u201d</p> <p>The lockdown has led to serious disruption of the UK\u2019s food supply chain, with farmers, producers and wholesalers struggling to divert tens of thousands of tonnes of perishable food no longer required by restaurants, pubs, hotels and schools.</p> <p>Britons spent \u00a388m on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/26/shoppers-shell-out-billions-eggs-flexitarians-uk-revival\">fresh eggs </a>as they stockpiled staple foods in the four weeks preceding the UK\u2019s initial lockdown, according to data from the British Egg Industry Council.

Many \u2013 including the interviewer who elicited the controversial comment on Friday, radio host Charlamagne tha God \u2013 think the running mate should also be African American.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t even care about the words,\u201d Charlamagne told MSNBC\u2019s AM Joy on Sunday, \u201cand the lip service and the apology is cool, but the best apology is actually a black agenda.

  "<p>The Audi Formula E driver Daniel Abt has been found guilty of using a ringer to drive for him in the Formula E esport championship. Abt has been disqualified from the race, fined \u20ac10,000 and as stripped of all his points after it was discovered he used a professional esport racer to compete in his place.</p> <p>The race took place on Saturday as part of the Formula E Race at Home Challenge Series, a virtual championship taking place while real racing is on hold because of coronavirus. Abt had qualified in second place at the virtual Flughafen Tempelhof circuit in Berlin and finished in third behind Oliver Rowland and the former F1 driver Stoffel Vandoorne.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/21/riyadh-saudi-arabia-12-race-season-formula-e-motor-sport\">New Formula E season makes history as Mercedes and Porsche enter the fray</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Abt had yet to score a point in the first four rounds of the series and immediately afterwards Vandoorne raised his suspicions. \u201cReally not happy here because that was not Daniel driving the car himself, and he messed up everything. That was ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m questioning if it was really Daniel in the car.\u201d</p> <p>Vandoorne was supported by the two-time FE champion Jean-Eric Vergne. \u201cPlease ask Daniel Abt to put his Zoom next time he\u2019s driving, because like Stoffel said I\u2019m pretty sure he wasn\u2019t in,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Formula E investigated and announced on Sunday that Abt had been \u201cdisqualified from the race for sporting misconduct\u201d. It is understood it checked IP addresses and discovered that Abt could not have been behind the wheel. The pro gamer Lorenz Hoerzing was identified as the driver who had sat in for Abt. Hoerzing is an 18-year-old who competes in the FE Challenge series, a parallel championship for esport drivers.</p> <p>Abt admitted both guilt and contrition in a statement. \u201cI would like to apologise to Formula E, all of the fans, my team and my fellow drivers for having called in outside help during the race on Saturday,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not take it as seriously as I should have. I am aware that my offence has a bitter aftertaste, but it was never meant with any bad intention.\u201d</p> <p>The 27-year-old German has been racing since 2008 and competing in Formula E since 2014. Abt\u2019s webcam had been on during the race, which was shown live, but the face of the driver was obscured by equipment and neither he nor Hoerzing took part in post-race interviews. Hoerzing has been banned from the Race at Home series.</p> <p>This is not the first controversy in esport racing. The Nascar driver Kyle Larson was sacked by Chip Ganassi racing and suspended indefinitely from the series after using a racial slur in a virtual race in April. And this month, last year\u2019s Indy 500 winer Simon Pagenaud attracted a storm of real-life protest after he cynically took out McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris during a virtual Indy 500.</p> <p>Esport racing is making a play to be taken seriously but Norris has acknowledged incidents such as these are not doing it any favours. \u201cI know it\u2019s virtual and people class it as a game, but it\u2019s become quite a bit more than that over the last few weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cYou still expect people to act professionally.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>We\u2019re at the reunion episode <em>already?</em> It seems mere moments ago that Crystal was skipping into the workroom like a hyperactive clown, and Heidi was standing in the doorway going \u201cLILILILILI!\u201d for no good reason. In reunion episodes, we get to hear from all the past contestants, with their thoughts on the trials and tribulations of the season. It\u2019s one for the hardcore fans, for sure.</p> <p>This one could make for a challenging watch (not to mention, a challenging recap) because it\u2019s all been done virtually, for obvious, world-changing reasons. But we must all do our best and plunge forward as safely and happily as possible. So here we go!</p> <h2>Do The Split-Screen</h2> <p>Three seconds in, and we\u2019re already exhausted. All the dolls are here, decked out in slumber-party finery, singing at us from their bedrooms, straight into our bedrooms (depending on where you watch it \u2013 but most people watch Drag Race in bed hungover, let\u2019s be honest). This makes it almost uncomfortably intimate. At least before, there was a solid fourth wall separation. This is making us check our phones to make sure they\u2019re not actually FaceTiming us.</p> <p>And yes, we\u2019re already being treated to a musical number \u2013 The Shady Bunch. Wonder if it\u2019s available on iTunes. After this mind-bending intro, we get a rare glimpse into RuPaul\u2019s home. There\u2019s lots of leopardprint. Not a fracking drill in sight. He takes us straight into a hectic recap, which serves as a reminder of the formidable amount of talent we\u2019ve seen from ALL the contestants, and also reminds us of the comparative lack of conflict \u2013 there\u2019s a marked absence of the screaming workroom fights that defined the earlier seasons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd0cc252b1bbc8258dfadf02a054bb8bd1c0820b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd0cc252b1bbc8258dfadf02a054bb8bd1c0820b/77_83_1274_764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drag Race\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Your final three, Crystal Methyd, Gigi Goode and Jaida Essence Hall</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VH1</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We head to Zoom to catch up with the girls \u2013 Brita\u2019s got a SNOOKER table in the background. Back home in North Carolina, Heidi\u2019s room looks like a show home from 2004. Rock M Sakura\u2019s backdrop is giving us anxiety, but it\u2019s so nice to see her. RuPaul thanks them all and says \u201cit do take nerve to flatten the curve\u201d. Sorry, but we\u2019re not ready for Covid Drag Race catchphrases yet. Just ... no. We won\u2019t be buying that t-shirt.</p> <h2>Heidi-N-Danger-Girl</h2> <p>Heidi reveals she had to take anger management classes as a kid, which is interesting, because she seems relatively soft and supple most of the time. She says acknowledging and controlling her anger helped her find her sense of humour. Many of the world\u2019s best comedians suffer or have suffered from major mental health issues, so you\u2019re in great company, Heidi. We tip our broccoli hat to thee. They cover Heidi and Gigi\u2019s uncomfortable makeup moment and apologise to one another candidly. Heidi reveals that her fans identify as \u201ccloset cases\u201d (amazing) and that as a result, she\u2019ll be keeping her original name, Heidi \u2018N\u2019 Closet! Excellent.</p> <h2><strong>Nicky Doll</strong></h2> <p>We cut to Nicky Doll and she\u2019s looking stunning as usual. It\u2019s such a shame she went so early \u2013 if she\u2019d have been able to overcome her demons, she could\u2019ve been a great talent and lasted to the end. The instant a Drag Race contestant says they themselves deserve to go home, you know they\u2019re done for. Blind self-confidence is an essential component when it comes to drag, and if that leaves you, it\u2019s time to go home. We\u2019re now cutting between single, two, three and five screens, with alternating shots of all the contestants and clips from the show and it\u2019s all getting a bit confusing. Aiden is rolling her eyes as Brita talks. She might have been rolling her eyes at something else and they did some cheeky editing, but either way it\u2019s funny.</p> <h2><strong>Jackie Cox</strong></h2> <p>Onto Jackie, and she acknowledges she\u2019s the bossiest one in the cast. Really though, in the scheme of things, she was still very polite. She was just <em>organised</em> compared to some the others. Real Housewives star and the subject of Jackie\u2019s hilarious Snatch Game character Lisa Rinna pops up! Her husband Harry Hamlin ambles into frame looking like he\u2019s not really sure what he\u2019s doing or what\u2019s going on. \u201cYa really nailed her!\u201d he says, leaning in and looking for the camera. Lisa gives a smile and a thumbs up, to screams from the queens.

Oh. One of THOSE people. Sorry, but anyone who says they\u2019re having a great time in quarantine is lying. It\u2019s a nasty assertion designed to make the rest of us feel bad about ourselves. But we think Aiden\u2019s statements are just hyperbole, so it\u2019s fine. Aiden looks great on this reunion call. Maybe because this is the first time we\u2019ve ever seen her in a different wig. Watching the recap, it\u2019s good that Aiden left when he did, because that storyline would\u2019ve worn thin very quickly. Even just revisiting it is tedious. NEXT.</p> <h2>Brita</h2> <p>New York queen Brita says this season was hard for her to watch, because she didn\u2019t like the person she saw in herself. This is great \u2013 she did have some slight bullyish qualities, and it\u2019s good that she\u2019s seen that in herself and will hopefully change as a result of it. We feel for her, too \u2013 it must be horrible watching yourself back and not like what you see. For journalists, the equivalent is re-reading your first ever piece of published writing *shivers*.</p> <h2>Dahlia Sin</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e3764cc84ef5901aa62ee7d446d6ac74a945fdc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e3764cc84ef5901aa62ee7d446d6ac74a945fdc/65_58_1308_785/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drag Race\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dahlia Sin, for once not dressed as a broccoli.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VH1</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Next we head to Dahlia, who looks like Daenerys Targaryen if she had done a Fine Art degree at Central St Martins. RuPaul asks why she was so annoyed at being eliminated. Why do you think, Ru?! She got eliminated first! Surely that\u2019s reason enough to be annoyed!</p> <h2><strong>Rock M Sakura</strong></h2> <p>One of our favourites (and our main crush of the show, fyi) Rock M Sakura, says the show helped her self-confidence and seeing comments from fans around the world made her feel \u201cso validated\u201d. Now that\u2019s great, Rock, but be careful on that Instagram, especially now during lockdown when these things are magnified. You don\u2019t want to end up like <a href=\"https://youtu.be/oLc2E4P87QE\">Bryce Dallas Howard</a>. Rock also says she\u2019s been working on her relationship with her mum and RuPaul looks a bit tearful ... or maybe something just flew into his eye.</p> <h2><strong>Widow Von Du</strong></h2> <p>Next we head to one of this series\u2019 most matter-of-fact and memorable contestants, Widow. She was intriguing, colourful and promising but suffered the same affliction as Nicky Doll, with a crisis of self-confidence ending in her elimination. She says she always used drag as something to hide behind \u2013 hiding her real self, Ray, under the glitz and glamour of Widow. Much of the time, people start doing drag as a form of armour and defence. Which is fine \u2013 there are many coping mechanisms less healthy than drag. The trick is to not let it take over, and not forget your real self.</p> <h2>Jan</h2> <p>It\u2019s Jan\u2019s turn to chat next, and we\u2019ve just noticed her dressing gown is covered in a print of her face, in which she\u2019s wearing exactly the same makeup as she is on screen, which she later mentions is merch. We get to see Jan\u2019s Kris Jenner audition tape and it\u2019s great.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/merazlex_/status/1263997494427451392\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">the ONLY Kris Jenner that matters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jansportnyc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@jansportnyc</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DragRace?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DragRace</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/bckWcst3Q4\">pic.twitter.com/bckWcst3Q4</a></p>&mdash; alex (@merazlex_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/merazlex_/status/1263997494427451392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 23, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>Bits and Pieces</h2> <p>The next part of the episode is a bizarre amalgamation of outfit recaps, general chat and the opportunity for the girls to read each other. Gigi says \u201cMiss Jackie Cox ... you are so supportive, I can always count on you for a face to file my nails on.\u201d Crystal says \u201cHeidi, you must be enjoying social distancing because you do look best from at least six feet away.\u201d Widow says \u201cGigi Goode ... I bet R Kelly wouldn\u2019t even piss on you.\u201d IS THAT ... CAN SHE ... IS THAT EVEN LEGAL FOR HER TO SAY THAT? Either way, 10 points to Widow.</p> <p>Next we go to questions from fans, and WHOA, it\u2019s \u201cMaria from Rancho Cucamonga!\u201d We just googled Rancho Cucamonga \u2013 it\u2019s a city in California with a population of 177,751, making it the 26th most populous city in the state. It\u2019s home to two public libraries, which together contain a total of 200,000 books. Its top employer is Inland Empire Health Plan, which provides 2.5% of the city\u2019s total employment.

  "<p>As Florida\u2019s beaches shut down in April, part of the state\u2019s pandemic stay-at-home order, Josh Davis noticed something strange in Palm Beach county.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of that beach crowd just kind of moved on to the road and the sidewalk. People set up lawn chairs on the grass,\u201d said Davis, an ocean rescue lifeguard with the county. \u201cIf the goal was to keep people from congregating, all it did was really push them a few feet away.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, when the beach officially reopened, it remained calm. Beachgoers trickled in, keeping their distance from each other, though not usually wearing masks. Davis was relieved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/20/park-inequality-access-coronavirus-wellbeing\">Millions of Americans lack access to quality parks, report reveals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, beaches \u2013 like testing and lockdowns \u2013 have become a polarizing issue. When photographs of a newly opened and crowded Jacksonville Beach in northern Florida flooded social media, critics tweeted #FloridaMorons. In New York City, residents are angry at Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/health/nyc-beaches-open-for-holiday-weekend-no-swimming-allowed/6206187/\">previous</a> decision to keep city beaches closed during Memorial Day weekend.</p> <p>Beaches tend to evoke more reaction and anger than parks and other public spaces. It\u2019s in large part, experts say, because the US shoreline is increasingly private, and controlled by fewer, and richer, people.</p> <p>\u201cWe went from a time, prior to WWII, where much of American shorelines were treated as public land, to a frenzy of privatization where the shoreline was gobbled up,\u201d said Andrew Kahrl, a professor at the University of Virginia who wrote The Land Was Ours: African American Beaches from Jim Crow to the Sunbelt South.</p> <p>Earlier in the 19th century, US beaches were largely public and inhabited by working-class coastal communities, many of them African American watermen, Kahrl said. The coastline wasn\u2019t coveted property, since it was hard to maintain in the face of natural forces like hurricanes and high tide, and it was groups like <a href=\"https://gullahgeecheenation.com/\">the Gullah</a>, who were the keepers.</p> <p>By 1970, however, <a href=\"http://bostonreview.net/class-inequality-race/andrew-w-kahrl-free-beach\">over 95% </a>of US coastlines suitable for recreation were closed to the general public. To add to those restrictions, many municipalities imposed parking fees and tolled roads to limit entry.</p> <p>The result is that our public beaches have become smaller and more crowded, while a small group of affluent elite hold the keys to the rest of the coastline. \u201cThe public\u2019s ability to enjoy the shoreline has decreased in direct proportion to our increasing inequality,\u201d Kahrl said.</p> <p>During the pandemic, this dichotomy has become even more obvious. Public health officials promote exercise and fresh air during citywide lockdowns, and virologists have said it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html\">largely safe</a> to be outside as long as people observe physical distancing. But, as the Guardian reported earlier this week, 100 million Americans, especially people of color and poor communities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/20/park-inequality-access-coronavirus-wellbeing\">don\u2019t have access</a> to a decent park or public space, which includes beaches.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The public\u2019s ability to enjoy the shoreline has decreased in direct proportion to our increasing inequality</p> <footer> <cite>Andrew Kahrl</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Neighborhoods in New York suffer from this lack of access, said Meg Walker, an architect with the Project for Public Spaces, including many of the neighborhoods in the boroughs of Queens and the Bronx that were hit hardest by Covid-19. \u201cThere\u2019s many people in these densely populated neighborhoods who have high asthma rates and poor air quality,\u201d she said, risk factors for the virus.</p> <p>Walker also pointed out that public beaches, even more than parks, tend to bring together people of different backgrounds, especially around holidays. The diversity on a public beach lies in stark contrast to that of a privately owned beach, which tends to skew white and upper class.</p> <p>The increased policing on beaches burdens black communities, who are more likely to have tense interactions with law enforcement. Already this year, in Los Angeles and Miami, the NAACP raised an alarm when <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-05/arrest-of-woman-at-beach-with-dog-prompts-questions-by-councilwoman-naacp\">black beachgoers</a> were reportedly aggressively <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/videos-show-miami-beach-arrests-black-spring-breakers-slammed-racist-n1160921\">accosted</a> by police.</p> <p>During the pandemic beaches have been caught in the political divide between Republican states that have loosened restrictions early and Democrat-run states, who have been far more cautious. In this case, states like Florida and South Carolina, which have long coastlines and Republican governors, opened their beaches as people in the north-east, governed by Democrats, remained at home.</p> <p>Now, as many communities in the north-east start to open up, they have decided to keep their shores closed to outsiders. In Connecticut, home to what Kahrl calls the country\u2019s most \u201c<a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300215144/free-beaches\">exclusionary coastline</a>\u201d, beaches are requiring residential passes to park near the shore. In Long Island, a cluster of suburbs near New York City, county officials have<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2020/05/19/long-island-beaches-will-be-closed-to-new-york-city-residents-1284560\"> made it clear </a>that people from the city are not welcome.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NassauExecutive/status/1262757611394314242\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As County Executive, my number one priority will always be the health and safety of our residents. <br><br>In order to ensure Nassau residents can enjoy our only County-operated beach, I will sign legislation designating Nickerson Beach for Nassau residents\u2019 use only.</p>&mdash; Laura Curran (@NassauExecutive) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NassauExecutive/status/1262757611394314242?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 19, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Oyster Bay, a quiet hamlet on Long Island with private beaches, normally allows non-residents to visit the beach on weekdays, but not on weekends. Throughout the pandemic, however, all of its beaches have remained closed to outsiders. <br><br>Joseph Saladino, the Oyster Bay supervisor, said the hamlet has erected barriers at the local train station, and entry points to the beach to make sure that only residents can enter. \u201cWe understand the beach offers a place for recreation but also an emotional renewal of sorts,\u201d Saladino said. But he said the restrictions were necessary to keep the capacity under 50%, and protect the residents who pay taxes in Oyster Bay.</p> <p>Public space advocates agree there is a real risk of beachgoers posing a threat to public health \u2013 young people in Miami during spring break in March, for example, ended up <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/florida-spring-break-coronavirus.html\">spreading Covid</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/florida-spring-break-coronavirus.html\">-19</a> to other parts of the country because the beaches were completely unregulated and had no distancing restrictions.</p> <p>Unlike parks, many beaches have also been at least partly closed throughout the lockdown, and when they open people might seize the opportunity in droves. \u201cI think there will be a flood of users,\u201d Walker said.</p> <p>But the solution, she said, is not restricting access to beaches. It\u2019s continuing to open more public spaces, like pedestrian roadways, and coming up with community-driven, creative ways to remind people to take precautions. In Detroit, for example, there was a project to open <a href=\"http://downtowndetroitparks.com/parks/Campus-Martius/things_to_do_in/The-Beach\">urban beaches</a> for residents. And Walker pointed out artists making public health signs instead of law enforcement.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Davis in Palm Beach was preparing for a surge of Memorial Day beach visitors because public beaches in nearby Miami and Broward counties remained closed.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re wondering what it\u2019s going to look like this weekend,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned we\u2019re still maintaining our primary objective \u2013 making sure people are physical distancing.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Coronavirus has taken a heavy toll on Chicago, with nearly 65,000 confirmed infections in Cook county and about 3,000 deaths.</p> <p>But the virus has hit black Chicagoans the hardest, shining a spotlight on racial inequalities that existed long before the pandemic.</p> <p>Though black residents make up 30% of the city\u2019s population, they account for 60% of its Covid-19 fatalities.

Racial discrimination in the healthcare system, environmental factors in predominantly black neighborhoods, and higher-than-average prevalence of preexisting conditions have also factored into the higher morbidity rates, according to the study.</p> <p>Local leaders, including Lori Lightfoot, the city\u2019s first African American mayor in three decades, have promised to address the disparities, both in the short term and at the structural level.</p> <p>\u201cThis can\u2019t just be temporary scaffolding,\u201d Lightfoot <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-chicago-african-american-population-20200420-c2nyvnq4vrcundwdfvhdldtlfe-story.html\">said</a> last month. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be laying a foundation for a permanent fix to many of the problems that for too long we have ignored or said they are too big to solve.\u201d</p> <p>Chicago and Illinois have implemented some measures aimed at blunting the virus\u2019 impact on the city\u2019s black community, as well as its Latinx population , which has also seen a <a href=\"https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/05/06/coronavirus-cases-more-than-double-in-chicagos-latinx-community/\">surge</a> in confirmed infections and now represents a quarter of the city\u2019s coronavirus deaths.</p> <p>Lightfoot has partnered with community groups in <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-chicago-african-american-population-20200420-c2nyvnq4vrcundwdfvhdldtlfe-story.html\">establishing</a> her Racial Equity Rapid Response Team aimed at addressing the crisis in black and brown communities, and Illinois governor J B Pritzker has ramped up testing in hard hit neighborhoods. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3a1f7b3b69f6534d84eebb79b419bbbfa0989b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3a1f7b3b69f6534d84eebb79b419bbbfa0989b4/0_0_4438_3154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man wears a protective face mask as he walks through the predominately black south side of Chicago.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man wears a protective face mask as he walks through the predominately black south side of Chicago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But black Chicagoans have expressed concern that the pandemic could exacerbate existing inequalities in America\u2019s third-largest city, and are calling for systemic changes.</p> <p>\u201cIs Chicago ready to have a reckoning with the true realities it has created?\u201d said Anton Seals Jr, whose group, South Shore Works, is part of the mayor\u2019s rapid response initiative. \u201cThat\u2019ll answer the question if it\u2019s going to get worse or it\u2019s going to get better.\u201d</p> <p>Seals praised the efforts to increase access to testing and other initiatives by the rapid response team, but said a larger push is needed, particularly among public officials and white citizens, to face up to the \u201cnasty truth\u201d of racism that resulted in the health and economic disparities in Chicago and the country as a whole in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to deal with this super-racialized society,\u201d Seals said, describing the way the pandemic has played out in Chicago as a \u201ctale of two cities\u201d.</p> <p>While some efforts have been made to address the disproportionate toll Covid-19 has taken on black Chicagoans, some here say more needs to be done.</p> <p>A coalition of organizations and progressive lawmakers at the state and municipal levels have launched the <a href=\"https://actionnetwork.org/campaigns/right-to-recovery\">Right To Recovery</a> campaign, which is aimed at addressing the \u201cgaping holes in our public health and social safety net infrastructure, as well as the brutal inequality built into our economy\u201d.</p> <p>Amika Tendaji, the Right to Recovery lead for the group Southside Together Organizing for Power, which has been working on housing issues related to the crisis, praised progressive measures to provide relief to communities hard hit by the pandemic, including legislation <a href=\"https://news.wttw.com/2020/05/04/progressive-democrats-propose-bill-canceling-rent-mortgage-payments-180-days-after\">proposed</a> by state representative Delia Ramirez to temporarily cancel rent and mortgage payments in Illinois. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked really hard to put politicians in place that are responsive to their communities,\u201d Tendaji said.</p> <p>But Tendaji expressed concern that top officials aren\u2019t taking bold enough action, calling the image of Lightfoot as a progressive mayor a \u201cfallacy\u201d and calling for structural change. \u201cThis is systemic racial injustice,\u201d Tendaji said.</p>",

Witherspoon plays something close to an older version of her character Tracy Flick in the 1999 film <em>Election</em>: living perfectly with four kids and lawyer hubby in Shaker Heights, Ohio, where, as the Shaker Good Neighbour Guide says, \u201ceverything can and should be planned to avoid uncertainty and disaster\u201d.</p> <p>Into this wander black single mother Mia and daughter Pearl.

She has, for her reading group, to suffer <em>The Vagina Monologues</em>, and insists prissily on calling it \u201cThe Virginia Monologues\u201d. She schedules sex with her husband on Wednesdays and Saturdays, written up with pink Post-It strips (\u201cdate-night: 9pm\u201d) on the family-planner psychoboard, and allows herself 4oz of white wine nightly. She yearns for her daughter\u2019s love, but black sheep Izzy likes to burn her own hair: \u201cShe just doesn\u2019t participate, and if you don\u2019t <em>participate</em> you can\u2019t succeed.\u201d The unexpressed quandary of every parent.</p> <p>Mia and Izzy bond through art, and a desire for difference. There will be fires, and heartache, and a certain relentless messaging \u2013 any art is good and thus fascinating, yet any normality, by dint of privilege, is worthless. There are far deeper questions, which struggle for answers, than were possibly raised in the book alone: Witherspoon has manufactured a clever monster.</p> <p>I was savagely unsure about reviewing <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000jbcf\">Horizon: What\u2019s the Matter With Tony Slattery?</a></strong>.

  "<p><br>When American astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley arrive at the International Space Station this week, they will find an unusual message waiting for them. On the inside of the hatch where their SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft is scheduled to dock, a small stars and stripes flag has been sealed in a plastic bag with a cryptic message attached. \u201cFlown on STS-1 and STS-135. Only to be removed by a crew launched from KSC.\u201d</p> <p>It sounds enigmatic but the meaning is straightforward. The flag, which measures 8 inches by 12 inches, was flown on board the first space shuttle mission (<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/archives/sts-1.html\">STS-1</a>) in 1981. And it was carried aloft in 2011 when the shuttle Atlantis rendezvoused with the space station on the last shuttle mission (<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/launch/sts-135_mission-overview.html\">STS-135</a>). KSC simply stands for the Kennedy Space Centre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20eef8dde7e6a62e58b2e1a41f91d796504ac027\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20eef8dde7e6a62e58b2e1a41f91d796504ac027/0_0_2733_2187/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, stand beside the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Astronauts Bob Behnken, left, and Doug Hurley, stand beside the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft, which is due to launch on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NASA/ZUMA Wire</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Departing astronauts on Atlantis had left the flag and message before flying their craft back to the US, where it was grounded with the other remaining shuttle craft in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/feb/04/challenger-space-shuttle-video-discovered\">Challenger</a> and <a href=\"https://www.space.com/19436-columbia-disaster.html\">Columbia</a> tragedies. Only when Americans returned \u2013 in a new fleet of their own spaceships \u2013 was that flag to be brought back to Earth, it was decreed.</p> <p>Now that moment is about to arrive. After a gap of nine years, during which US astronauts have had to undergo the ignominy of hitching rides to the space station in Russia\u2019s cramped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/dec/11/soyuz-space-fifty-years-old\">Soyuz space capsules</a>, American men and women are set to return to orbit in their own craft \u2013 in this case, Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX Crew Dragon spaceship. </p> <p>It will be a triumphant moment for America as it enters a new stage in its often troubled crewed space programme. Crewed spaceflights into low Earth orbit will now be taken over by private businesses which have already been ferrying supplies to the space station. To date, only the governments of America, Russia and China have been able to mount crewed space programmes. Now US business is taking a lead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1385278766d134ea3eb88d735684aa8d8a9efa59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1385278766d134ea3eb88d735684aa8d8a9efa59/0_0_3393_2257/1000.jpg\" alt=\"SpaceX founder and chief engineer Elon Musk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">SpaceX founder and chief engineer Elon Musk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Nesius/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an important moment, not just for the US but for all the other national groups involved in the space station,\u201d said Frank De Winne, head of the European Space Agency\u2019s astronaut centre in Cologne. \u201cWe will be able to have a full compliment of seven astronauts on the station. At present, there are only three because transport has been limited. Crew Dragon means we can get back up to strength and catch up with all the science that we couldn\u2019t do for lack of personnel.\u201d</p> <p>Putting astronauts into orbit has always been costly and has bedevilled efforts to open up space as a commercial frontier. Nasa had developed a strong risk aversion policy, which meant its vehicles were more complex than necessary, and a lack of competition provided no incentive to keep costs down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902uVsudRNgu76U/\" data-alt=\"Guardian graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902uVsudRNgu76U/\">Guardian graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Now that is changing. Apart from the involvement of Musk\u2019s SpaceX company, the aerospace giant Boeing has also built its own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/dec/22/nasa-boeing-starliner-capsule-lands-safely-new-mexico\">spaceship, Starliner</a>, and later this year it also plans to ferry astronauts to the space station. On the sidelines, companies such as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/science/jeff-bezos-moon.html\">Blue Origin</a>, founded by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/05/20/business/ap-us-virgin-orbit.html?searchResultPosition=9\">Virgin Orbit</a>, founded by Richard Branson, and several other companies are also working on their own commercial space plans.</p> <p>\u201cThat should slowly have an effect,\u201d said De Winne. \u201cSpace travel should become cheaper as these different companies compete, and that will mean we can spend more on our satellites and probes and less on launching costs.\u201d</p> <p>It has not been an easy task, however. SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 launcher \u2013 which will ferry Crew Dragon into space \u2013 broke apart once in flight and once during a ground test. Boeing suffered numerous software failures during test missions of its Starliner, and only flew in space, uncrewed, last December. Commercial launches were planned for 2017 but are only now set to take place.</p> <p>Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon are now standing at Kennedy\u2019s launch pad 39A and should lift off for the space station on Wednesday. Should the mission be scrapped at the last minute, however, Boeing\u2019s Starliner spaceship will then have the chance to become the first crewed commercial spaceship.</p> <p>And thereby hangs a tale. Starliner will be commanded by Charles Ferguson, who was commander of Atlantis on its last mission, and who was involved in leaving the flag and message on the space station hatch.</p> <p>Intriguingly, on that mission he was accompanied by Doug Hurley, who is now the commander of Crew Dragon. Both men have remained in the US crewed space programme and are rivals to bring back the flag, with Hurley in pole position. Ferguson remains unflustered. \u201cRegardless of who might get there first, it\u2019s a win for America,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 May 2020 to refer to \u201ccrewed\u201d (rather than \u201cmanned\u201d) space missions.</p>",
  "<p>Scientists have warned there could be major delays in producing a Covid-19 vaccine if current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/number-of-people-with-coronavirus-in-england-remains-stable-says-ons\">UK infection rates remain low</a> and lengthy waiting times are needed to show if candidate products are working. As a result, some researchers insist that ministers must now consider implementing radical alternative measures to speed up vaccine development.</p> <p>In particular, they argue that Britain should consider <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/08/who-conditionally-backs-covid-19-vaccine-trials-that-infect-people\">deliberately infecting volunteers</a> involved in vaccine-testing projects \u2013 in line with World Health Organization proposals to set up such human challenge trials. Earlier this month, the WHO issued a 19-page set of guidelines on how these trials might operate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/why-we-might-not-get-a-coronavirus-vaccine\">Why we might not get a coronavirus vaccine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, other UK scientists have reacted with horror at the proposal to implement human challenge trials for a Covid-19 vaccine on the grounds that these could cause serious illness and possibly deaths of volunteers who had been deliberately infected with the virus.</p> <p>The dilemma was summed up by Jonathan Ives of the Centre for Ethics in Medicine at Bristol University. \u201cIf we were to do this, we would be asking healthy people to put their wellbeing and their lives at risk for the good of society at large. On the other hand, taking that risk could speed up vaccine development and save many, many lives. So I think there could be grounds for going ahead with challenge trials, though it would be based on a very finely balanced argument.\u201d</p> <p>Figures released last week suggest about 7% of the UK population may have already been infected with Covid-19 virus, a relatively low level of infection that poses problems for testing vaccines. A sufficient number of volunteers has to be exposed to the virus to see if a vaccine protects them or not. But if their chances of being in contact with an infected person are low, it will take a long time to demonstrate the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/18/first-human-trial-results-raise-hopes-for-coronavirus-vaccine\">efficacy of a vaccine candidate</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e9adfd88441a7924380e00edd276de6a2db4156\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e9adfd88441a7924380e00edd276de6a2db4156/0_39_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Little bottles labelled vaccine Covid-19 and a syringe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO says the least risky group for trials comprises healthy volunteers aged 18-30.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dado Ruvi\u0107/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a result, scientists have proposed that human challenge trials could be introduced to test a vaccine quickly and so save thousands of lives by preventing future infections. \u201cLevels of infection in the community are already low, and if this virus behaves like other respiratory diseases and coronaviruses, there may be even lower levels over the summer,\u201d said Professor Lawrence Young of Warwick University Medical School. \u201cThere will not be enough people secreting the virus to be in contact with volunteers in vaccine projects. It is just not going to work.\u201d</p> <p>Young argues that human challenge trials should be considered \u201cvery seriously\u201d for the UK. These would involve giving volunteers either a placebo or a vaccine, as is normally done in trials. But instead of waiting to find out how the two groups fare without interference, scientists would deliberately infect them with the Covid-19 virus. This would very quickly show if a vaccine works or not.</p> <p>\u201cOnly very healthy young people \u2013 around the age of 25 \u2013 who have given informed consent would be used,\u201d added Young, who points out that such trials have already been used to test the efficacy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/higher-flu-vaccination-rates-could-help-expose-new-viruses-like-covid-19-earlier-expert-says\">vaccines for flu</a> and the common cold.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Only very healthy young people \u2013 around the age of 25 \u2013 who have given informed consent would be used</p> <footer> <cite>Professor Lawrence Young, Warwick University</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, these ailments pose relatively low risks to volunteers. Covid-19 can have serious side-effects, mainly for the elderly but also in a few rare cases of young, apparently healthy people. This point is acknowledged by Young. \u201cBefore we went ahead with challenge trials, we would need to have developed some very effective therapy \u2013 an anti-viral drug perhaps \u2013 that could be used in the few cases where something went seriously wrong.\u201d</p> <p>This latter point has been stressed by WHO in its guidelines for human challenge trials. It suggests the least risky group to infect would be those aged 18\u201330 years. Only 1% of this group end up hospitalised with Covid-19, while fatality rates are around 0.03%. \u201cChallenge studies should then be conducted in specialised facilities, with especially close monitoring and ready access to early supportive treatment for participants,\u201d add the guidelines.</p> <p>The idea of carrying out human challenge trials for a Covid-19 vaccine was also backed by Professor Arpana Verma, of Manchester University. \u201cVaccines give us the ability to protect the most vulnerable people in society. That is one of their key strengths. So I think it would be entirely justifiable to go ahead with such trials.\u201d</p> <p>But the proposal was firmly opposed by immunologist Professor Eleanor Riley of Edinburgh University. \u201cChallenge studies are done for many diseases but only when strict criteria are followed. Firstly, the virus should be really well studied and its clinical behaviour understood in detail. It should also be incapable of causing severe illness in healthy individuals, or there should be a highly effective drug to clear the infection. None of these criteria are met for Covid-19, and I would be very concerned to hear challenge studies were being planned.\u201d</p> <p>The crucial point is that we should be thinking now whether we want to go ahead with human challenge trials, said Young. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t wait until we have a vaccine candidate on our hands and not know what to do with it.\u201d</p>",
