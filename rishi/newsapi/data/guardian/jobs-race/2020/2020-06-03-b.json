  "<p>Three former chancellors have warned the government to prepare for 1980s levels of unemployment as the coronavirus crisis sinks Britain into the deepest recession in living memory.</p> <p>Lord Alistair Darling, George Osborne and Philip Hammond said the government urgently needed to announce measures to cushion the blow as job losses began to mount.</p> <p>Darling, who as Labour\u2019s last chancellor led the response from No 11 to the 2008 financial crisis, told the Commons Treasury committee: \u201cWe need to get ourselves into the frame of mind where we\u2019re thinking about 1980s levels of unemployment.\u201d</p> <p>Osborne, his Conservative successor, also suggested the current economic collapse could trigger mass unemployment. \u201cThere will be loads of people in businesses that have gone bust that aren\u2019t going to return, and people who are coming off furloughs into unemployment. That is going to be a big social challenge, and of course economic challenge, for this government,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s unemployment rate peaked at almost 12% in 1984 during the period of de-industrialisation overseen by the Thatcher government.</p> <p>The Bank of England has warned joblessness could more than double from the current rate of 3.9% by the end of the year as Covid-19 and lockdown measures used to contain the virus bring the economy to a near standstill.</p> <p>The former chancellors\u2019 interventions come as the current chancellor, Rishi Sunak, prepares to scale back the government\u2019s furlough wage subsidy scheme from August.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/28/job-vacancies-collapse-has-hit-low-income-workers-hardest-ons\">UK manufacturers planning tens of thousands of redundancies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As lockdown restrictions are rolled back in an attempt to reopen the British economy, Sunak is believed to be working on a fresh package of policy measures, including job creation initiatives, expected to be announced in July.</p> <p>Darling said if he were still chancellor he would be getting the whole of government involved in drawing up measures to keep people in work or to help them retrain if they lost their job.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/13/lessons-from-the-past-uk-biggest-quarterly-economic-declines\">The UK's biggest quarterly economic declines</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cGovernment needs to be planning.

He also implied that scientists are sceptical about the policy generally. Asked if Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, had endorsed this timetable, he said dates and policy were a matter for ministers. He also said quarantine works best when the infection rate is low in the country receiving visitors and high in those countries sending them in. This is not the case with the UK at the moment vis-\u00e0-vis arrivals from most EU countries.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, said it would take \u201cquite some time\u201d before the new test and trace system was working at full capacity.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The new thing that has been brought in - and it is definitely, as you imply, in the early stages of its development, but it is definitely there, and definitely working, but it will work a lot better over time - is the new element of test and trace ...</p> <p>We are not yet at cruising altitude for this. The number of tests is going to keep on going up and our ability to use the tests we have got is going to carry on going up. This is going to carry on for quite some time before we get to the point where we are all satisfied we have got to the point we need.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson ducked a question about whether Britons would be able to take a foreign holiday this summer.</strong> Asked if it was safe to book one, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not going to give advice on individuals\u2019 travel arrangements, but you know what the Foreign Office guidance is... everybody at the moment should avoid non-essential travel.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed he was a Sinophile.</strong> Asked about Huawei and whether he would now exclude it from the 5G network, he said he wanted solutions that worked for UK security.

Obviously in normal circumstances the Guardian is never wrong, but on the basis of what happened at PMQs today it is not clear that anything much has changed. At PMQs Starmer has consistently presented himself as the most reasonable person at the dispatch box (more on that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/29/uk-coronavirus-live-priti-patel-questions-response-covid-19-crisis-pmqs-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ea970fa8f0853abef659a0a#block-5ea970fa8f0853abef659a0a\">here</a>, including why it worked for another opposition leader) and today he won the \u201ctalking sense\u201d competition quite comfortably.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t as if the questions were, on their own, especially memorable. But Starmer does tend to specialise in loaded questions to which there is no safe or easy answer (\u201cwhen did you stop beating your wife?\u201d questions, as I think they are known at the bar), and Johnson has yet to develop any plausible response mechanism. At their last PMQs he tried responding with promises (the \u201cworld-beating\u201d test and trace system). We had a flash of that from Johnson at PMQs later, when he pledged to ensure all test results are turned around with 24 hours by the end of the month (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/03/uk-coronavirus-live-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-lockdown-easing-pmqs-covid-19-latest-updates-news?page=with:block-5ed786cd8f084df971c8edc7#block-5ed786cd8f084df971c8edc7\"> 12.19pm </a>\u2013 there may well be some clarification of quite what this involves at the lobby briefing later) but mostly, in his exchanges with Starmer, Johnson resorted to criticising the opposition leader for \u2013 well, opposing the government.

And it suggests that 21% of people say they are following lockdown rules less strictly than before - with a third of those saying that\u2019s at least partly because of Dominic Cummings.</p> <p>Here is the chart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a620dac087420c31be77a80f62781da5874f1668\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a620dac087420c31be77a80f62781da5874f1668/0_0_1868_1430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polling on lockdown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"766\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polling on lockdown</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouGov</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As <strong>Chris Curtis</strong> explains in <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/health/articles-reports/2020/06/03/one-five-have-started-breaking-lockdown-rules-more\">a commentary for the YouGov website</a>, Cummings\u2019 excursion to Barnard Castle is not the only factor that might explain why people are taking the lockdown rules less seriously. Curtis says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Those advising the government had always suggested that people would become less observant of the rules as time goes on, which was one of the reasons for delaying lockdown in the first place.</p> <p>We have also seen an increase in the proportion of the public who think the situation is getting better, from 58% to 76% in two weeks, which might also be making some less cautious.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another factor might be ambiguity in the wording. The polling was carried out on Thursday last week and, when people were asked what they had done in the past week, 21% said they had followed the lockdown rules less strictly than previously. When the same question was asked at the end of April, only 5% gave that answer. But by Thursday last week the lockdown rules were less strict than they had been anyway and so some of those 21% may just be people transitioning from obeying the old rules to the new ones.</p> <p>Still, any evidence that people are taking socially distancing less seriously should be worrying. The documents released by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies repeatedly stress that easing the lockdown is only safe if people continue to comply with restrictions like the two-metre rule. For example, this is what\u2019s Sage\u2019s scientific pandemic influenza group on modelling (SPI-M-O) said in <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/888759/S0313_SAGE33_Consensus_for_SPI-M_on_transition_strategies.pdf\">a consensus view (pdf)</a> dated 4 May.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Behavioural changes in the levels of adherence rates are critically important, likely more so than the exact policies implemented, in determining whether the reproduction number remains below 1.

Too often, by default, black people are perceived as threats to white people\u2019s physical safety.&nbsp;And as a consequence, it is our physical safety that is compromised, as the stories of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/central-park-new-york-white-woman-black-birdwatcher\">Christian Cooper</a>, the birdwatcher who filmed a white woman in Central Park lying to the cops about how he was threatening her (when all he did was ask her to leash her dog), and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, the man who died with a police officer\u2019s knee on his neck, illustrate.</p> <p>I have backpacked around the world and lived in Nepal and Kenya, and I\u2019ve seen how my presence can be challenged or questioned. Earlier that year, when I lived in Seattle, I went hiking on Mt Baker with two white friends.&nbsp;It was a typically cloudy and cool day, and we stopped at the park lodge to warm up.&nbsp;At some point, my friends wandered off while I stood there with my colorful shawl wrapped around me.</p> <p>I began to feel uneasy; I noticed an elderly, white woman staring at me.&nbsp;Suddenly, she jumped (as did I).&nbsp;She then said: \u201cMy dear, I thought you were a beautiful, Indian statue.\u201d&nbsp;I was shocked, as I didn\u2019t know whether to feel complimented (you\u2019re beautiful) or insulted (I wasn\u2019t even real).&nbsp;Not to mention her complete misidentification of my racial and ethnic origins.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Regardless of my age and experience, I still feel unsafe walking outside in the country of my birth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My experiences backpacking through mountain trails and wildlife have forever changed the way I see and engage nature. I have channeled that passion into my work: I completed a PhD in geography, taught classes about the environment in our institutions of higher learning, written about the black experience of the outdoors, served on the national parks advisory board for eight years and work with environmental non-profits and government agencies on diversity and environmental issues.&nbsp;I am invested in finding ways to improve the quality of our relationship with the environment and our relationship to each other. But regardless of my age and experience, I still feel unsafe walking outside in the country of my birth.</p> <p>I wish I could feign surprise at what happened to Christian Cooper when he encountered Amy Cooper in Central Park.&nbsp;I wish I could imagine it to be a blip in the United States\u2019s history; an accident, an outlier, not at all reflective of the truth of how black people are all too often treated.&nbsp;But I can\u2019t.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Amy Cooper threatened to tell the police that \u201can <em>African American</em> man is threatening her life\u201d, she revealed what it\u2019s like to know, deep down in your bones that she would be protected, valued and saved by virtue of her skin color.&nbsp;By calling the police, she exemplified what James Baldwin meant when he said that whiteness is about power.</p> <p>Our outrage as black people is justified.&nbsp;Let me say that again.&nbsp;Our outrage as black people is justified. As the CNN commentator Don Lemon said recently: \u201cThe knee has always been on our neck.\u201d&nbsp;But your outrage, white America, is not enough. What many of us want is fundamental, consequential and absolute change.</p> <p>The response to Amy Cooper by a justifiably angry public \u2013 the demands for her to lose her job, her dog and perhaps some \u201cmembership\u201d in her community \u2013 is frustrating because it leaves me wanting.&nbsp;None of those measures would change the way Christian Cooper or any African American is perceived in any outdoor space, or any space for that matter.</p> <p>The revelations about Christian Cooper having gone to Harvard and how he sits on the board of the New York City Audubon Society (which I\u2019m thrilled to learn) should not matter as much as they seem to. This information helps us understand the passion and commitment he brings to birding. They do not confer his worth. At the end of day, it\u2019s about everyone being protected, valued and if need be, saved, regardless of their station in life.&nbsp;</p> <p>What happened between Amy Cooper and Christian Cooper was, in many ways, simply an echo of what\u2019s always been true in the US about our ability, as black people, to walk in the woods or on a city street.&nbsp;We are all Christian Cooper and George Floyd.&nbsp;</p> <p>What can be done? We should recognize that systemic racism exists on both the streets of our cities and inside our national parks. We have to see full representation at every level in the environmental sector, and we need power structures to shift so that black and brown people are shaping policies and our national conversations. We need predominantly white environmental organizations and academic institutions to be more concerned with how the climate crisis disproportionately impacts black and brown people and give more resources to these communities. We need to change the prison industrial complex and law enforcement, which both undoubtedly shape how black people move through space.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is not about political correctness. These changes must be the product of something learned, understood, believed in and practiced by our institutions, our leaders and our communities.</p> <p>I believe that this country \u2013 which was founded on slavery and stolen land \u2013 can make a different choice, the same way Amy Cooper could have made a different choice. And I can aspire to live in a place where I will not be seen as an anomaly or something to fear or challenge, but instead, am embraced as a reflection of our common humanity that doesn\u2019t deny our differences, but celebrates our possibilities.</p> <ul> <li><p>Carolyn Finney is the author of Black Faces, White Spaces: Reimagining the Relationship of African Americans to the Great Outdoors, and a scholar-in-residence at Middlebury College in Vermont</p></li> <li><p>The opinions expressed here are those of the author.

  "<h2>Key points</h2> \n<p>Sir Keir Starmer&nbsp;started by saying how shocked he was by the death of George Floyd. Referring to today\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/03/uk-coronavirus-live-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-lockdown-easing-pmqs-covid-19-latest-updates-news?page=with:block-5ed75eda8f087122eca54958#block-5ed75eda8f087122eca54958\">Telegraph story</a>, he asked who has been in charge of the UK\u2019s coronavirus response up to now.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson&nbsp;also condemned what happened to George Floyd. But he said people should protest in a peaceful way. He said he took full responsibility for the UK coronavirus strategy. He said people know that \u201cwith good British common sense\u201d we can tackle this.</p> \n<p>Starmer&nbsp;said Johnson asks him to cooperate but didn\u2019t reply to a letter he sent privately offering his cooperation on schools. He also said a survey at the weekend showed a huge fall in trust in the government. Johnson<strong>&nbsp;</strong>replied that he phoned Starmer after he got the letter and said Starmer did not criticise his policy. He said the public were following the government guidance. Starmer&nbsp;replied that he would publish his letter.</p> \n<p>Starmer said the government should have been working on a test and trace system for weeks. Dido Harding, who is in charge of the system, said it would not be fully ready until the end of June. Johnson&nbsp;accused Starmer of casting aspersions on the people behind the scheme and said it was up and running on 1 June. He said thousands of people were now self-isolating.</p> \n<p>Starmer&nbsp;said Johnson did not put a number on those being contacted and added that the number infected each day was far bigger than those tested. He said the system should contact 45,000 people a day. He quoted the UK Statistics Authority criticism of the government and asked the PM whether he could see how much damage was being done to trust?</p> \n<p>Johnson&nbsp;said Starmer continues to undermine trust in government and asked for some credit for the people involved. Starmer responded that Johnson was mistaking scrutiny for attacks. </p> \n<p>Starmer said he would like to support the government\u2019s policy but Johnson made it difficult. He said the government said it would not relax the lockdown until the alert level was lowered. What was it now, and what was the R number?</p> \n<p>Johnson&nbsp;said the alert level did allow the lockdown to be relaxed, even though it had not been lowered. </p> \n<p>Starmer&nbsp;said scenes in parliament of MPs forming a kilometre-long queue to vote were \u201cshameful\u201d and excluded MPs who were shielding. If any other employer operated like this, it would be a clear and obvious case of discrimination. Will the PM stop this?</p> \n<p>Johnson<strong>&nbsp;</strong>said people around the country were having to queue. He said it was not unreasonable to expect MPs to do their job. He also said older MPs and those shielding should be allowed to vote by proxy. </p> \n<h2>Snap verdict</h2> \n<p>Sir Keir Starmer gave&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/keir-starmer-warns-pm-get-a-grip-or-risk-second-wave-of-coronavirus\">an interview to the Guardian</a>&nbsp;that was interpreted by us, and others, as indicating a hardening of his stance against the government - less consensus-seeking, more condemnatory. Obviously in normal circumstances the Guardian is never wrong, but on the basis of what happened at PMQs today it is not clear that anything has changed. At PMQs Starmer has consistently presented himself as the most reasonable person at the dispatch box (more on that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/29/uk-coronavirus-live-priti-patel-questions-response-covid-19-crisis-pmqs-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ea970fa8f0853abef659a0a#block-5ea970fa8f0853abef659a0a\">here</a>, including why it worked for another opposition leader) and today he won the \u201ctalking sense\u201d competition quite comfortably.</p> \n<p>It wasn\u2019t as if the questions were, on their own, especially memorable. But Starmer does tend to specialise in loaded questions to which there is no safe or easy answer (\u201cwhen did you stop beating your wife?\u201d questions, as I think they are known at the bar), and Johnson has yet to develop any plausible response mechanism. At their last PMQs he tried responding with promises (the \u201cworld-beating\u201d test and trace system). We had a flash of that when Johnson pledged to ensure all test results are turned around within 24 hours by the end of the month (there may well be some clarification of quite what this involves at the lobby briefing) but mostly, in his exchanges with Starmer, Johnson resorted to criticising the opposition leader for \u2013 well, opposing the government. He accused Starmer of launching \u201cendless attacks on public trust and confidence\u201d and of \u201ccasting aspersions\u201d on the good character of people working on test and trace (some of whom are spending much of their time watching Netflix because they don\u2019t have enough to do, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52904433\">according to the BBC</a>).</p> \n<p>This is a lame form of parliamentary defence at the best of times. But given that the PM is facing criticism for not even doing his own job properly, it was unwise to invest so much in attacking Starmer for doing his.</p>",
  "<p>The Metropolitan police are facing claims of bias after figures showed that officers enforcing the coronavirus lockdown were more than twice as likely to issue fines to black people as to white people.</p> <p>The Met, which covers London, issued 973 fines between 27 March and 14 May. White people, who make up 59% of London\u2019s population, received 444 fines, or 46% of the total; black people, who make up 12% of London\u2019s population, received 253 fines, or 26%. Asian people, who make up 18% of London\u2019s population, received 23% of the fines.</p> <p>Analysis for the Guardian by Dr Kriszti\u00e1n P\u00f3sch, a lecturer in crime science at University College London, shows a clear disproportionality.</p> <p>Posch said: \u201cCompared to their share of the population, people from a black ethnic minority were 2.17 times more likely to receive a fine and Asians around 26% more likely. In comparison, whites were 23% less likely to be fined.\u201d</p> <p>There was also a disproportionality in the number of arrests made for alleged breaches of Covid-19 lockdown rules. White people were under-represented, making up 38% of arrests, while black people were over-represented, making up 31% of arrests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2020-06-03T12:54:58/embed.html\" data-alt=\"arrests chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2020-06-03T12:54:58/embed.html\">arrests chart</a> </figure>  <p>The Met says it tried to avoid issuing fines, preferring to seek to persuade people to obey the lockdown rules, which limited the reasons why people could leave their homes and how many people could gather together.</p> <p>The Met, which is Britain\u2019s largest police force, was one of the forces least likely to use enforcement powers, compared with other forces.</p> <p>The Met said: \u201cIn total, more white people received FPNs [fixed penalty notices] or were arrested than other individual ethnic groups. However, when compared with the composition of the resident population, higher proportions of those in black and minority ethnic (BAME) groups were issued with FPNs or arrested across London as a whole.</p> <p>\u201cThe reasons for this are likely to be complex and reflect a range of factors. This includes interactions between the areas subject to significant proactive policing activity targeting crime hotspots and both the variation in the age profile and geographical distribution of ethnic groups in London.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2020-06-03T12:55:13/embed.html\" data-alt=\"fines chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2020-06-03T12:55:13/embed.html\">fines chart</a> </figure>  <p>The fairness of police powers, such as stop and search, is a long-running theme for policing, and for the Met especially.</p> <p>Leroy Logan, a former Met superintendent, said: \u201cI can\u2019t discount that these figures exhibit a racial bias, because practically everything the Met does has a racial bias. The Met is still institutionally racist and the use of Covid powers is part of this.\u201d</p> <p>Sgt Janet Hills, the chair of the Met\u2019s black police association, said of the figures: \u201cI struggle to think of why there can be any justification. We deal with intelligence all the time and we know that this pandemic has impacted on everyone.</p> <p>\u201cIt shows that even though we\u2019re going through one of the biggest social upheavals since anyone can remember and having to adjust to a new way of doing things, if you\u2019re black then disproportionality will always remain a constant in our lives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere are a number of things that already impact on black communities, like living in a more densely populated areas, which has made adhering to the lockdown slightly more challenging. Our essential workers who may live in these areas have no choice other than to do their part to keep London functioning. But because they are black, because they live in a \u2018high crime\u2019 area, they fall into a profile that stereotypes them.\u201d</p> <p>Katrina Ffrench, of StopWatch, which campaigns for the fair use of police powers, said: \u201cThe numbers are clear. Black and Asian people are disproportionately being given fines in comparison to their white peers.
