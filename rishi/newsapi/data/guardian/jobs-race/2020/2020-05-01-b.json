  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s fourth White House press secretary delivered a 30-minute briefing on Friday, ending a more than year-long hiatus for the once-daily occasions.</p> <p>It was effectively a public debut for Kayleigh McEnany, whose immediate predecessor, Stephanie Grisham, never delivered a briefing in nine months in the role.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/joe-biden-denies-sexual-assault-allegation-tara-reade-statement\">Joe Biden denies sexual assault allegation from former staffer Tara Reade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recently, Trump has turned daily coronavirus task force briefings into multi-hour back-and-forths with the press. Taking the lectern for the first time, McEnany stressed that she would be speaking on behalf of the president and the highest-ranking officials in his administration.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m around the president almost the entire day,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just with him before I left to come out and speak with you guys.</p> <p>\u201cI think my staff can attest to the fact that they have a very hard time finding me because I\u2019m normally with the president in the Oval Office. So I\u2019m consistently with him, absorbing his thinking, and it\u2019s my mission to bring you the mindset of the president, deliver those facts so this president gets fair and accurate reporting and the American people get fair and accurate information.\u201d</p> <p>McEnany was less outwardly combative than Trump. She did not accuse White House reporters of being or peddling \u201cfake news\u201d. Nor did she say any outlet had terrible ratings.</p> <p>Still, she repeated Trump\u2019s main arguments. Regarding<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/us-gives-g7-countries-a-list-of-reforms-it-wants-who-to-undertake\"> the World Health Organization and its role in battling the coronavirus outbreak</a>, for example, she said: \u201cThe WHO appears to clearly have a China bias.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, you look at this timeline and it\u2019s really damning for the WHO when you consider the fact that on 31 December you had Taiwanese officials warning about human-to-human transmission, the WHO did not make that public.</p> <p>\u201cOn 9 January, the WHO repeated China\u2019s claim that the virus does not transmit readily between people, that was quite apparently false. On 14 January, the WHO again repeated China\u2019s talking points about no human-to-human transmission.\u201d</p> <p>Under fire for his own administration\u2019s response to Covid-19, which as of Friday afternoon had infected more than 1 million Americans and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/30/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">killed more than 63,000</a>, Trump has accused the WHO of slow-walking moves that could have prevented global spread. Earlier in April, he announced that his administration would halt funding to the organization, pending a review.</p> <p>McEnany\u2019s first briefing also landed on the day that Trump\u2019s all-but-certain general election opponent, the former vice-president Joe Biden, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/joe-biden-denies-sexual-assault-allegation-tara-reade-statement\">publicly responded to an allegation of sexual assault</a> by a former Senate staffer.</p> <p>McEnany was asked about comments made by the president in an interview with a conservative radio host, that the allegation against Biden by Tara Reade was more credible than those made against the supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford or against Trump by numerous women.</p> <p>McEnany framed the accusations as old news that had been cleared up by Trump\u2019s victory in the 2016 election.</p> <p>\u201cHe has always told the truth on these issues,\u201d she claimed. \u201cHe\u2019s denied them immediately and you\u2019re bringing up issues \u2026 from four years ago that were asked and answered and the American people had their say in the matter when they elected President Trump as president of the United States.</p> <p>\u201cLeave it to the media to really take an issue about the former vice-president [Biden] and turn it on the president and bring up accusations from four years ago that were asked and answered in the form of the vote of the American people.\u201d</p> <p>McEnany also discussed Michael Flynn, the first of Trump\u2019s four national security advisers who resigned after a brief spell in the role and pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/donald-trump-full-pardon-michael-flynn\">has indicated a potential pardon for Flynn</a>, who has not yet been sentenced.</p> <p>On the subject of recently unsealed investigative documents, McEnany was asked why she called the FBI investigation of Flynn a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d, given his guilty plea. Reporters, she answered, should more aggressively cover how the FBI handled the investigation.</p> <p>Again, the press secretary \u2013 who earlier promised \u201cnever\u201d to lie to reporters \u2013 sounded some of the same notes, in a the same tone, as Trump.</p> <p>\u201cDo you not consider it a miscarriage of justice when you have the FBI writing \u2018We want to get someone to lie?\u2019\u201d McEnany said. \u201cThe answer\u2019s \u2018yes\u2019 and I encourage the media to cover it, because I\u2019ve watched a lot of your networks I\u2019ve read a lot of your papers.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a whole lot of scant information about Michael Flynn, when there was a whole lot of speculation about Russia, Russia, Russia, culminating in $40m of taxpayer money being lost, and the complete and total exoneration of President Trump.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/trump-michigan-protesters-gretchen-whitmer\">Michigan: Trump says Whitmer should 'make a deal' with protesters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most observers do not consider the special counsel Robert Mueller to have exonerated Trump in his investigation of Russian election interference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/28/crime-in-progress-glenn-simpson-peter-fritsch-review\">and links between Trump and Moscow</a>. Indeed, though he did not establish a criminal conspiracy or recommend charges of obstruction of justice, Mueller said he was not clearing the president. Trump and his allies have regularly claimed exoneration regardless.</p> <p>It is unclear how often McEnany will appear in the White House briefing room. Trump press secretaries had their appearances scaled back after the president decided they were doing an inadequate job.</p> <p>\u201cAs to the timing of the briefings, we do plan to do them,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cI will announce the timing of that forthcoming but we do plan to continue these.\u201d</p> <p>Her first appearance had lasted about half an hour, well short of Trump\u2019s marathon sessions.</p>",
  "<p>Dave Kitson\u2019s bid to become chief executive of the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association has received a blow after the chairman of Kick It Out questioned his anti-racism credentials and three black players attacked the former Reading striker\u2019s controversial comments about Raheem Sterling.</p> <p>Kitson launched his campaign to replace Gordon Taylor as the head of the PFA this week but he faces an uphill battle to win the support of black players, who have not forgotten how he reacted to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/30/chelsea-ban-fan-life-racial-abuse-raheem-sterling\" title=\"\">Chelsea supporter racially abusing Sterling</a> in December 2018 by saying that the Manchester City forward\u2019s social media posts had \u201cantagonised\u201d people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/06/pfa-chief-executive-gordon-taylor-says-he-will-not-take-wage-cut\">PFA's Gordon Taylor not cutting salary but donates \u00a3500,000 to NHS and charity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 40-year-old was accused of excusing racism after suggesting Sterling had made himself a target during an appearance on TalkSport and his bid to replace Taylor has been met with an angry response from current and former professionals. Jobi McAnuff said Kitson\u2019s remarks about Sterling had crossed a line and the Leyton Orient captain\u2019s views were backed up by Marvin Sordell, the former Bolton striker, and Marcus Bean, the former Brentford and Wycombe midfielder.</p> <p>Sanjay Bhandari, the head of Kick It Out, football\u2019s anti-discrimination charity, said: \u201cThe PFA are valued partners of Kick It Out. Anyone who has aspirations to lead the PFA in the future must have in mind the best interests of all players. Given Dave Kitson\u2019s previous remarks, I would be deeply concerned about his ability to represent black players. He needs to win their confidence and I doubt he can do that.\u201d</p> <p>At the time Kitson said Sterling\u2019s posts were \u201cno excuse whatsoever for racially abusing somebody, but you sow a seed amongst people who are not racist, not to like that particular person, because they don\u2019t want to see that in their faces every day\u201d. When contacted by the Guardian about the reaction to his PFA bid he said: \u201cMy objective is to ensure that the policies of the union reflect the needs and aspirations of all its members. Very importantly, that must include a much more effective anti-racism policy.\u201d</p> <p>McAnuff, who spent a season in the Premier League with Reading, said: \u201cHe\u2019s had his say on certain matters, particularly on Raheem Sterling, and that certainly was something that I objected to in the most severe manner. He\u2019s almost saying he brought on any racist abuse himself. That is inexcusable. Even if Raheem Sterling had been posting pictures of his lifestyle, that gives nobody a right to racially abuse somebody.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact he could suggest that was a reason is completely unacceptable. I\u2019ve gone on Dave Kitson\u2019s Instagram and seen some of the pictures he\u2019s put on, which would be similar to what he was saying about Raheem showing off. He has pictures with a gun, he has pictures with flash cars after his retirement. It was massively hypocritical.\u201d</p> <p>McAnuff insisted an apology would not suffice for him. \u201cA line has been crossed,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t see that many other players in my position would accept an apology and be happy to move on.\u201d</p> <p>Sordell, who retired last year, was asked whether he thought Kitson is unfit to lead the union. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cThe PFA represents players. They are where players go for protection. Whether that\u2019s happened or not in the past or currently is a different debate. If we look forward to the future and to somebody who makes excuses for racism and doesn\u2019t protect the player, how can we look to those people for protection in the future.</p> <p>\u201cWhat he said is so wrong and it\u2019s that mentality that stops us progressing. What he said isn\u2019t necessarily racist but it allows room for racism to grow. It allows people to think saying certain things is OK. It isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Bean, who also retired last year, said: \u201cIt\u2019s audacity. Having someone like that in charge would leave a sour taste in my mouth. I would vehemently protest it before he was in charge. He wouldn\u2019t receive my vote and I\u2019d be actively trying to rectify the situation if he was in charge. People aren\u2019t happy. Not just players but also black agents I speak to and other staff in the game. People are asking how this can be representative of us.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Even amid a roaring pandemic, there are currently two Americas: \u201cUnemployment America\u201d and \u201cStock Market America\u201d, dueling lenses to view the same country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/trump-brad-parscale-campaign-manager\">Trump erupts over poll slump and threatens to sue campaign manager</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unemployment America is bleak but in Stock Market America things are looking up. Taken together, this split reality portends a rough ride for the president\u2019s re-election bid and even greater national discord. Donald Trump has every reason to worry.</p> <p>First, Unemployment America. On Thursday, the labor department reported that another <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OPA/newsreleases/ui-claims/20200774.pdf\">3.8 million people</a> filed first-time unemployment claims, bringing the total of those who are recently out of work to more than 30 million.</p> <p>This cataclysmic data came on the heels of the steepest first-quarter GDP decline since the Great Recession, projections of a second-quarter GDP drop of 40% and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/28/business/jobs-unemployment-coronavirus-hassett/index.html\">an admission by Kevin Hassett</a>, the president\u2019s chief economic adviser, that unemployment could hit 20% by June, a level not experienced since the Great Depression.</p> <p>For a president who claimed to be a champion of the working class, this is an abject failure. The answer to the question of whether you are better off today than you were four years ago would appear to be simple. But it isn\u2019t.</p> <p>At the same time as the economy is cratering and coronavirus\u2019s death toll has surpassed the number of US troops killed in Vietnam, the stock market has rebounded from its March lows. As a result, its behavior under Trump still surpasses its performances during the Reagan and Bush Sr years. For how much longer is still an open question.</p> <p>On the other hand, as far as Barack Obama and Bill Clinton went, Trump isn\u2019t even close. Still it\u2019s a quantifiable achievement, and those close to the president and his campaign know it.</p> <p>In a conversation with the Guardian, a connected Trump campaign adviser took pride in the market\u2019s April advance, expressed displeasure with the word choices of Trump\u2019s economic advisers, and remained mute with regard to recent job losses.</p> <p>In Trump\u2019s world, it\u2019s the \u201cstock market, stupid\u201d. No wonder Jared Kushner boasts that the administration coronavirus response \u201cis a great success story\u201d, and opines \u201cthat\u2019s really what needs to be told.\u201d Can you say, \u201cMission Accomplished 2.0\u201d?</p> <p>At the 1984 Democratic convention, Mario Cuomo, the late New York governor and father of Andrew Cuomo, the incumbent, riffed on Charles Dickens and delivered the most memorable keynote speech in recent history. Cuomo told those assembled that the nation was more a \u201cTale of Two Cities\u201d than a \u201cShining City on a Hill\u201d.</p> <p>To be sure, the speech won accolades but failed to resonate. Walter Mondale, the Democratic nominee, was shellacked on election day.</p> <p>Mondale\u2019s problem was that by 1984 most of the US came to believe that it was Morning in America. The recovery was real, inflation had been drained from the system.</p> <p>Beyond that, President Reagan had not made the stock market the exclusive barometer of the country\u2019s wellbeing. Rather, the drop in unemployment moved in tandem with the Dow\u2019s rise.</p> <p>2020, however, is a very different time and Trump is a very different president. Unemployment America is getting ravaged.</p> <p>The labor department\u2019s latest report is also flashing red over key electoral battlegrounds. Michigan and Pennsylvania are among the states with the highest insured unemployment rates. At the same time, Florida and Texas are among the states showing largest numbers of initial jobless claims. Not surprisingly, recent polls show Joe Biden with small but persistent leads in <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/fl/florida_trump_vs_biden-6841.html\">Florida</a>, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/mi/michigan_trump_vs_biden-6761.html\">Michigan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_biden-6861.html\">Pennsylvania</a></p> <p>To put things into perspective, if those results hold on election day, Biden would be the 46th president and Trump would go down as an impeached one-term president.</p> <p>But now even <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/tx/texas_trump_vs_biden-6818.html\">Texas is in play</a>, which last went Democratic in 1976. Back then, the ticket of Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale prevailed over a Watergate-stained Republican party. Indeed, the latest poll of Texas voters gives Biden a one-point edge. Beyond that, Texas\u2019s emerging woes may signal problems ahead in the rest of the oil patch.</p> <p>There is a reason that the president reportedly threatened to sue his campaign manager and erupted, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/trump-brad-parscale-campaign-manager\">I\u2019m not fucking losing to Joe Biden</a>\u201d \u2013 because he possibly will. Trump\u2019s Two Americas strategy appears devastating to working Americans and to himself.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lloyd Green was opposition research counsel to George HW Bush\u2019s 1988 campaign and served in the Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992</p></li> </ul>"
