  "<p>Rain falls in the Almer\u00eda desert. A mummified hand gradually emerges from the sluiced sand. It appears to be giving a one-figured salute to the sky. It is the perfect opening image for Netflix\u2019s irreverent, brash, kinetic new 10-part crime drama-cum-caper.</p> <p>The desiccated corpse is identified as Axel Walker (Tom Rhys Harries), a young DJ who moved from Manchester to the Balearics 20 years ago with a group of friends trying to make their mark on Ibiza, and who subsequently disappeared without trace. The thriller unfolds on two timelines: the group\u2019s 90s glory days, when they ruled the clubbing roost in Manchester and their gradual comedown as they try to settle in Spain, and the present-day mystery of who killed Axel and why. In the absence of much police concern, his sister Zoe (Laura Haddock, the lead in recent BBC drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/03/the-capture-review-chillingly-real-thriller-or-utter-bobbins-lets-check-the-tape\">The Capture</a>) flies out to Nancy Drew it herself.</p> <p>Simply put, White Lines is a massive amount of fun. It\u2019s the latest creation of \u00c1lex Pina, the man behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/02/how-money-heist-became-netflix-biggest-global-hit\">Money Heist</a> \u2013 the streaming platform\u2019s most watched non-English language series \u2013 and it gathers momentum with every scene. Each one ratchets up the suspense (it emerges early on that Axel was involved with the daughter of the head of Ibiza\u2019s main crime family, the Calafats), the emotional investment (the effects of what Zoe thought was her brother\u2019s careless abandonment on her) or the gleeful absurdity. In the opening episode, Axel\u2019s former best friend, Marcus (Daniel Mays). can be found resuscitating a dog that has overdosed on the cocaine leaking from the inflatable banana boat he uses to haul his product in. There\u2019s plenty of sex, too, courtesy of Marcus\u2019s ex-wife Anna (Angela Griffin) who runs what the new girl guides are advised not to call orgies but do very much resemble, at least to the untutored eye, exactly that. They\u2019re especially popular with Oriol Calafat, the family\u2019s son and heir, as a way of relaxing in between trying to expand the family business beyond club-running and skimming drug money.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"White Lines trailer\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Uj7uyeaJjFQ?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, the head of the family is busy commissioning his heavies to find out who killed Axel and buried him on Calafat land \u201cto fuck with me\u201d. The first port of call for his right-hand man, Boxer, is Marcus, who is almost drowned in a swimming pool until Zoe harpoons the big fella through the leg. There are no hard feelings though \u2013 Boxer is a professional who understands the price of his business \u2013 and the three of them attend hospital together.</p> <p>White Lines has been hyped as the hit of the summer, and even though it will not be the summer any of us were expecting I\u2019d be surprised if this lurid, swirling, fantastically confident creation didn\u2019t hit the spot. Its energetic brio and the escapism-cum-nostalgia-trip (via a soundtrack stuffed with the Happy Mondays, the Farm, Radiohead and all points in between), may be even more rapturously received under current conditions than it would otherwise have been.</p> <p>Guardian trigger warning: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2020/jan/23/want-to-know-what-racism-feels-like-ask-laurence-fox\">Laurence Fox</a> pops up in episode three as a friend of Axel\u2019s who abandoned the club scene for a spiritual awakening in India.

  "<p>Since 1975, Oakland\u2019s Marcus Books has survived one of the most dramatic gentrifications in US history, aggressive competition from online stores, and the inevitable racism directed at a space that celebrates black voices. Located in a city that saw its black population nearly halved over two decades, Marcus Books staff learned how to navigate the intense pressures and forge a path towards survival.</p> <p>But all those years of hard work were wiped away overnight when the Bay Area announced a strict shelter-in-place order in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Now, a seminal living piece of American history \u2013 the nation\u2019s oldest black bookstore \u2013 is at risk of disappearing forever.</p> <p>\u201cA black bookstore is not only about the exchange of merchandise,\u201d Jasmine Johnson, whose grandparents founded Marcus Books, tells the Guardian. The disappearance of Marcus Books \u2013 which first opened in San Francisco in 1960 \u2013 and other black-centric book stores would be devastating for the larger black community, she says. \u201cWe\u2019re really about congregating around the diversity of black living and thinking. Surviving under economic duress is nothing new to us, but this is something totally different.\u201d</p> <p>The acute distress Marcus Books and other black bookstores are facinghighlights a severe disparity in reader-led funding. City Lights, an independent bookstore founded in San Francisco in 1953 and designated a landmark in 2001, launched<a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/aeany-keep-city-lights-books-alive\"> a Go</a><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/aeany-keep-city-lights-books-alive\">Fund</a><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/aeany-keep-city-lights-books-alive\">Me</a> last month and met its goal of $400,000 in days. At the time of writing, the bookstore had surpassed its goal by nearly $100,000. City Lights has not disclosed how it plans to allocate the excess funds, amid calls to donate them to other struggling local bookstores.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5a301f579078a055bfc241df25c0d74ce954749\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5a301f579078a055bfc241df25c0d74ce954749/2_2_472_294/472.jpg\" alt=\"Marcus Books in Oakland.\" width=\"472\" height=\"294\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcus Books in Oakland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Marcus Books</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, Marcus Books launched its <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/marcus-books-anniversary-fundraiser\">Go</a><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/marcus-books-anniversary-fundraiser\">Fund</a><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/marcus-books-anniversary-fundraiser\">Me</a> in April and has failed to reach even half of its $200,000 goal. When asked about the stark differences in Marcus Books\u2019 and City Lights\u2019 fundraisers, Johnson argues: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty deeply connected to what happens when you qualify anything with black. You\u2019re met with suspicion or dismissal.\u201d She believes fundraisers by black bookstores are viewed by the larger public as a niche interest. \u201cThe publishing industry has had a history of framing us as a \u2018diversity section\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Black bookstores have fought tooth and nail for the past three decades, as a handful closed each year. According to the African-American Literature Book Club, there were over 200 black-owned bookstores in the 90s. In 2019, <a href=\"https://aalbc.com/bookstores/list.php\">the number was slightly over 120</a>. The pandemic has only exacerbated their already precarious existence.</p> <p>Johnson sees this as an opportunity to remind America why supporting black bookstores is important, even in normal times. \u201cWe want to come out of this and go from simply surviving to thriving,\u201d she says of her hopes for the store\u2019s fundraiser.</p> <p>In an industry where black authors frequently receive less attention and promotion than their white counterparts, bookstores such as Marcus Books play an important role. Malcolm X was among the shop\u2019s customers, and over the years, prominent black authors such as Maya Angelou and Toni Morrison held events at the bookstore \u2013 often before they experienced crossover success and were struggling to book events elsewhere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/30/us-publishing-american-dirt-survey-diversity-cultural-appropriation\">US publishing remains 'as white today as it was four years ago'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen I was publishing in the 90s and early 00s and had regular tours, Marcus was one of my favorite book stops,\u201d the science-fiction writer Tananarive Due says<strong>.</strong> Blanche Richardson, who runs the store, \u201cis a community gem and had sold so many of my books that Marcus produced some of my largest and most enthusiastic crowds. I was so in love with Marcus that I included the store in one of the scenes in my horror novel, The Good House, as an hommage to try to capture the magic of the store. Marcus is more than a bookstore \u2013 it\u2019s a neighborhood, city and state institution.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4a02788dafc4b8ea7ec0801fb59c189e30593fbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a02788dafc4b8ea7ec0801fb59c189e30593fbf/0_211_2941_1764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Black Panthers march in protest of the trial of co-founder Huey P Newton in Oakland.

Johnsonsays she and other staff encountered \u201cwhite-only-water-fountain-level racism\u201d often. This continues during the pandemic: \u201cIt shows up on Twitter through people asking \u2018Why does a black bookstore need to be saved? Why can\u2019t they save themselves?\u2019 They\u2019re usually from anonymous accounts.\u201d</p> <p>Marcus Books\u2019 call for help is not unique.

Unlike many other independent bookstores, Marcus Books lacks an online operation. So, for now, the store is reliant on phone orders and storefront pickups, severely limiting business when many customers are rarely leaving their homes and turning to online delivery in unprecedented numbers. Richardson, the daughter of the Marcus Books founders, is still operating the store every day.</p> <p>The contributions to Marcus Books are trickling in, but not fast enough. Hoping to boost support, the store organized an online stream that featured live readings from the poets Danez Smith, Daveed Diggs, Tongo Eisen-Martin, and others. More than 400 people attended, raising $9,000. Johnson said it was more than a fundraising event, offering a chance for the black community to connect. \u201cThere was a real alchemy that came together during it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Despite all of the challenges facing Marcus Books, Johnson says she is optimistic about the future of the store.

  "<p>Hard to set something in Ibiza, isn\u2019t it? There are reasons for this, obviously: that most people\u2019s idea of Ibiza was fixed a long time ago, the summer they turned 20, during one particularly hedonistic week they spent there getting rawly sunburned, only eating one meal in eight days and shaking Tim Westwood\u2019s hand at a urinal seconds after dropping their first ever pill. Capturing that sweat-sticky, flirting-with-the-shots-girl feeling on film is close to impossible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2020/mar/25/the-guide-staying-in-sign-up-for-our-home-entertainment-tips\">The Guide: Staying In  \u2013 sign up for our home entertainment tips</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Also, there\u2019s something inescapably <em>Ibizan</em> about Ibiza, some salty magick that leaks out from the rocks and sand, a fine film that settles over everything it touches. Much like EastEnders can only happen in the miserable confines of outer east London, and the backbiting of Emmerdale can only happen in a small town that smells of manure, so Ibiza-set programmes are necessarily shaped by the island\u2019s inherent ridiculousness. Turn round and salute the sun gods who brought you here. Offer them a fresh bag of MDMA along the blanched white bones of the beach.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj7uyeaJjFQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Uj7uyeaJjFQ?start=17&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=17\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And so to<strong> </strong>White Lines<strong> </strong>(Friday, Netflix), which on the surface should be rubbish. \u201cA woman leaves her quiet Manchester home to identify the body of her brother who disappeared 20 years prior,\u201d the press release says. \u201cWhile investigating the mystery, she gets pulled into a world of crime, excess and coke-filled banana boats.\u201d Laura Haddock (Guardians of the Galaxy) plays the titular \u201ca woman\u201d. Daniel Mays (Line of Duty, Rogue One, everything) is the one with the banana boat full of coke. An expansive English\u2013Spanish cast keeps various story plates spinning: there is a shady, rich, Spanish matriarch with a secret to hide, a security detail with a heart of gold (Or? Is? He?), and Angela Griffin, who for some reason is in charge of orgiastic sex parties.</p> <p>Played wrong, this would just be big-budget Kevin &amp; Perry Go Large: dance scenes that push home how Very Important being on ecstasy feels, a smudgy glamour of cocaine and white bikinis and getting your legs broken by drug wholesalers. And don\u2019t get me wrong, White Lines has all that. But it\u2019s played with a lighter touch, Ibiza the beat pulsing in the background, not the lead vocals. What\u2019s unfurling in front of you is a genuinely intriguing mystery with enough sleights-of-hand to keep you guessing throughout. It\u2019s just unfurling while Daniel Mays spills so much coke across his lawn that his dogs get high. White Lines is the answer to the question nobody has ever thought to ask: what if Poirot got on the sesh?</p> <p>Curiously, for a Netflix production, White Lines defies the binge: there\u2019s so much going on \u2013 so many threads and flashbacks and days turning to night \u2013 that it\u2019s hard to consume more than an episode at a time. This feels weirdly refreshing, pulling you back from the sprint-to-the-finish watch-through like a bouncer in a smoking section. For that reason, it doesn\u2019t quite feel like it\u2019s Netflix\u2019s next discourse-shaping blockbuster. But it does prove there\u2019s still space for TV dependables: a murder that needs solving, a secret from the past that threatens the calm of the present, and people with Drama Centre Manc accents passing ecstasy around while loudly saying \u201cproper\u201d.</p>"
