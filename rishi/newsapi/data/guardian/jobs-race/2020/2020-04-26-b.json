  "<p> People working in some of Britain\u2019s most beautiful areas will be worst hit by the expected wave of unemployment following the coronavirus pandemic, according to forecasts suggesting the economic burden of Covid-19 is set to be spread unevenly.</p> <p>Workers in the tourism-driven economies of the Lake District, Cornwall and the beauty spots of Yorkshire are at the highest risk of being left jobless, according to research by the Royal Society of Arts and Manufacturing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/jobs_at_risk/giv-3902GLrI8jdu9lVt/\" data-alt=\"UK areas in which jobs are most at risk\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/jobs_at_risk/giv-3902GLrI8jdu9lVt/\">UK areas in which jobs are most at risk</a> </figure>  <p>People living in London, south-east England and the knowledge economies of Oxford and Cambridge are the least likely to lose their livelihoods, the study says.</p> <p>With 80% of workers in the hotel and food industries on furlough schemes, alongside 68% of those in arts, entertainment and recreation, about a third of jobs are permanently at risk in the longer term in the tourism-reliant areas of Richmondshire, which covers much of the Yorkshire Dales, Eden, which covers part of the Lake District, and Cornwall and the west Devon coast.</p> <p>Nearly 27,000 jobs are at risk in Pembrokeshire and the Cotswolds alone. Many of the areas facing the biggest job losses are in Conservative heartlands. Last week Visit Britain estimated that Covid-19 would cost the tourism industry around \u00a315bn in 2020, with 22 million fewer visitors to the UK.</p> <p>\u201cOur analysis finds a stark geographical divide in terms of how Covid-19 could impact local labour markets with rural areas and coastal towns most at risk of high job losses,\u201d said the report\u2019s authors, Fabian Wallace-Stephens and Alan Lockey. \u201cMany of the most vulnerable areas are located in the north and south-west of England. Cities and other urban areas tend to be at less risk, particularly in London or in its surrounding commuter belt.\u201d</p> <p>The RSA found that younger workers aged 16 to 24 were more than twice as likely to be furloughed as middle-aged workers.</p> <p>A separate study, also published on Monday, says black and minority ethnic citizens will find the coming economic conditions hardest to weather because they have much less money saved to fall back on.</p> <p>The Runnymede trust found that for every \u00a31 of wealth and savings held by white British citizens, Pakistani households have about 50p, black Caribbean households about 20p and black African and Bangladeshi households approximately 10p.</p> <p>There is increasing evidence that black and minority ethnic people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/racial-inequality-in-britain-found-a-risk-factor-for-covid-19\">are disproportionately represented among the victims of the coronavirus</a>, with many Asian doctors, nurses and taxi drivers among those known to have died.</p> <p>\u201cAs well as the cost in life of Covid-19, economic gaps in society are being exposed and even widened, and the effects may last for a generation, affecting ethnic minorities particularly,\u201d said Omar Khan, the director of the Runnymede Trust.</p> <p>\u201cDuring this lockdown, children are being educated at home and some adults are working from home. Many are having to dip into savings, but little consideration is given to those who have no savings to fall back on are not able to work from home and have no IT equipment or not enough space to effectively school their children.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Season 12 of Drag Race seems to be going by quicker than a bottle of gin in lockdown \u2013 we\u2019re mere weeks away from the final, which raises an interesting question. Will they postpone it? Will they film it on Zoom, the three finalists waiting with bated breath from their bedrooms? Or will they just not have one and leave us to draw our own conclusions?</p> <p>That would be quite subversive but we\u2019d actually be here for it. VH1 however, would probably end up getting sued by Gigi Goode, who we\u2019re picturing marching into a courthouse with a team of silent lawyers in sunglasses.</p> <p>We\u2019ve put out our journalistic feelers for some intel on the final, so watch this space!</p> <h2>The Workroom</h2> <p>Widow is very honest about how, while she\u2019s of course sad to see Jan go, she\u2019s glad she beat her. While not our favourite, Widow has actually been consistently honest and <em>real</em> for the duration, which may well be why she\u2019s still here.</p> <p>Jaida characteristically doesn\u2019t mince her words. \u201cIf a robot, a Barbie and a cheerleader all had an orgy, then had a robot-cheerleader baby, bitch ... that would be Jan.\u201d</p> <p>Heidi has officially changed her name to Heidi Hydrates. NO, HEIDI! We loved you for your strength of character and weirdness, and your awful, hilarious name (Heidi N Closet) reflected that. It was Ru that came up with Hydrates last episode, so does that mean she now ... owns ... Heidi? Either way, we are VERY disappointed in you, Heidi. Now, go get some skirts from Calvin Klein. And the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm2CwGbTrbI\">twins need the unpublished Harry Potter manuscript</a>.</p> <p>We\u2019d like to put this next thought to readers \u2013 what do we all make of the Sherry Pie edit? Because nine episodes in, and with increasingly less girls to edit around her, it\u2019s getting ridiculously awkward. She\u2019s there in some challenges and not in others. Sometimes she\u2019s on the runway, sometimes not. Our take is \u2013 include the message about her at the end, fine. Then, for the sake of the organic running of the show, either edit her out completely (which would probably be impossible) or just treat her like any of the other queens. They should have more faith in their viewers. We\u2019re clever enough to draw our own conclusions as to whether Sherry is a bad person or not. To Sherry or not to Sherry, which would you prefer?</p> <h2>\u2018Oh, an unfinished garment\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab9da76da610587fe07c85190da8a15f8a43e56e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab9da76da610587fe07c85190da8a15f8a43e56e/275_8_840_504/500.jpg\" alt=\"Gigi Goode\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gigi Goode\u2019s pussy impression was on fire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VH1</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This week\u2019s minichallenge is sponsored by a type of \u201chealth-monitoring cat litter\u201d. This is why I love queer culture, it\u2019s so nuanced and interesting! The dolls are tasked with getting into quick cat drag. Hi, Jennifer Hudson! This is hilarious, and they all shine.</p> <p>Gigi regards a ball of wool with a level of disdain that\u2019s actually quite unsettling \u2013 and utters the immortal line \u201cOh, an unfinished garment.\u201d Crystal purrs her way into Lana Del Rey levels of glamorous apathy and Jackie Cox deservedly wins, after felining around (as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X19t4m66gfM\">Eartha Kitt</a>) with even more unsettling panache than George Galloway in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQA2X4yvK_g\">Celebrity Big Brother</a>. She wins $2,500 worth of jewellery. They\u2019re throwing so much money around this season, we\u2019re half expecting a fur-rendered Taylor Swift to descend from the ceiling. But she doesn\u2019t. A missed opportunity.</p> <h2>Choices, 2020</h2> <p>This week it\u2019s the political debate episode, which is always interesting. It offers an insight into how plugged in the girls are to \u201cthe discourse\u201d and also how quick on their feet they are with giving clever, concise answers to quite random and aggressive questions. You wouldn\u2019t think that was an essential skill for a drag queen, but it really is. Just put on a full face of makeup and spend a Saturday night in a corner shop in East London once lockdown\u2019s over and you\u2019ll understand what we mean.</p> <p>Ru\u2019s doing the walkaround with Raven and the other girls are getting understandably miffed at how much free material is being given to Heidi. Gigi says she gets anxious around talk of politics \u2013 we feel you, Gigi! Ru says \u201cit\u2019s not something to be afraid of, it\u2019s actually quite simple.\u201d We just spat out our coffee. But Ru redeems himself in the next breath but describing Raven as a \u201cstaunch political strategist\u201d.</p> <p>Sidebar: WE LOVE RAVEN. If you don\u2019t, get off this browser tab immediately. You don\u2019t deserve to be here! Ru and Raven both hate Crystal\u2019s idea of creating funding for the arts ... Ru even groans \u201cBOOOORING!\u201d OK.

They\u2019re clearly having an absolute blast. Jeff Goldblum saying \u201cshe done already done had herses\u201d in his slow drawl, is honestly all we need out of television and out of life. \u201cDon\u2019t you love waking up in the morning, not knowing where you are, who you are ... why you are?\u201d says Jaida. This is actually getting quite metaphysical and very surreal. Rachel Bloom is nodding sagely. Jeff Goldblum is visibly pondering the question. This might be the best episode of Drag Race ever.</p> <p>To the runway. CATEGORY IS \u2013 stars and stripes forever. It might just be that the theme is a bit garish, or it might just be because we want to watch that debate forever, but we\u2019re not really loving many of the girls\u2019 runway looks. Except Jackie\u2019s hijab which is stunning and a Drag Race first. Gigi is gorgeous too of course, in a \u201cQuaker Oats fantasy\u201d. The same silhouette as her Pirate look, if we\u2019re picking nits.</p> <p>Goldblum, in our view, shows his naivety when he feels the need to question Jackie\u2019s runway look \u2013 and how it tallies with Muslim views on homosexuality and women. It\u2019s her heritage to do with as she wishes, and these are questions she has herself pondered during the show. She holds her own beautifully with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/natlndrs/status/1254246496800616448\">her rebuttal</a>. Her retittal of the retuttal of the rebuttal.

  "<p>My dad said it to me when I was seven years old and it stung like vinegar on a paper cut. Of all the things you throw at kids you never know which ones will stick. This one accidentally stuck. I\u2019m not black enough. The phrase, the unblackness, was planted, and developed like an irksome bruise I only feel when I bend a certain way. It\u2019s a scar tissue formed from acid poured into my wound after I was hit by the paternal truck of not-black-enoughness. An unexploded bomb that\u2019s leaking mustard gas into my blood.</p> <p>I\u2019m fully grown now, but the comment still tinkles lightly on the piano of my mind. Whiteness is in my blood. Well, half of it. My mum\u2019s never done an ancestry DNA test, but as a woman from north London who regularly burns in the British sun, it\u2019s safe to assume she\u2019s majority Caucasian. I\u2019m mixed-raced and grew up in multicultural Brighton. When my parents split up, my dad stayed in Brixton and I was occasionally evacuated to him on school holidays. As a single parent, aware of her son\u2019s racial identity, my mum rallied, and founded <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mosaicbrighton/\" title=\"\">Mosaic</a>, a support group for mixed-parentage families. Brighton is inherently liberal, but \u201cHow come your mum\u2019s white, but you\u2019re not?\u201d was the power ballad of my childhood.</p> <p>Luckily, each peer-to-peer micro-aggression that questioned my identity actually fortified my sense of self. Sorry to go a tad Oprah, but they were all learning experiences en route to the slightly too self-assured man I\u2019ve become. I call it public school confidence, but without the fees. Of all the things I am \u2013 tall, loud, almost aggressively expressive \u2013 black is the one people see first. But I\u2019ve never felt defined purely by my race. That might be what my dad was getting at.</p> <p><em><strong>I can\u2019t truly shake</strong></em> the reality that I have lived a predominantly white life, with a white mother and stepdad and \u2013 in the past 20 years \u2013 a four-bedroom home in the countryside, a boat and a house in France. These shiny new things don\u2019t tally with my mum getting chased down the street with me in a buggy as people screamed the N-word at her. I\u2019m not steeped in the residue of my 1980s Brixton youth, nor is this quite the rags-to-riches <em>My Fair Lady</em> story.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My dad\u2019s comment still tinkles lightly on the piano of my mind</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As I gaze around me at the white middle-class paraphernalia, my amassed signifiers of success, I know I am culturally white. It\u2019s a sticky, uncomfortable feeling, like the fur on unbrushed teeth, or a door that doesn\u2019t close completely flush. That\u2019s not to say there are no successful black people on the same page as me, but I haven\u2019t lived out the reductive story of blocked opportunity so often associated with inner-city black men.</p> <p>I wish there was a turning point, some clear moment I assimilated, but the whiteness and privilege were my climate and I just changed. Like any human, I adopted the values of the lives immediately adjacent to mine.</p> <p>I\u2019ve both succeeded and failed as a black person, and that\u2019s a tricky thing to fully express without falling into tired stereotypes. I sometimes feel like a kind of poster boy for liberals, because I\u2019m an ethnic some way up the ladder of successful capitalism. Ironically, my biggest fear is that my blackness has opened more doors than it has closed. That rankles me more than the missed opportunities. I joked in my teens that I\u2019m catnip for middle-class women, and that\u2019s somehow still a constant nag. Have I been championed by people who quietly knew they were doing something wholesome by supporting me? Not charitable exactly, just good.</p> <p>Positive discrimination should be invisible to the naked eye, but racism in the UK has followed a similar path, evolving alongside endeavours for equality. People aren\u2019t noticeably discriminatory; the least accepting people take the most umbrage to being called racist. But racism is thriving, invisible like carbon monoxide, inhaled through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit</a> and exhaled in a constant hammering criticism that sees a duchess and her husband relinquish their titles.</p> <p>We all want to be liberal. To love thy neighbours, even the ones we are only connected to by follows and likes. But we\u2019re right-on splodges on a massively biased canvas. The system is skewed. Sometimes I feel as if I\u2019m compensating or I\u2019ve diluted my blackness like vodka in a cheap club.</p> <p>I\u2019m paranoid I\u2019m the palatable black man, the kind of guy you party with, the kind who won\u2019t kick up a fuss unless you make an explicitly racist joke (the London bubble keeps me pretty sheltered from those, to be honest). Have I gradually made myself more digestible, WD40ing myself for social lubrication because I don\u2019t want to be the guy with a chip on his shoulder bringing everyone down? Is this a form of social survival, or just the self-levelling screed of living in a community? I guess it\u2019s the same palatability that\u2019s expected of women the world over, so I\u2019ll put my tiny violin away for now.</p> <p>In my book I explore the idea of not being a specific type of gay \u2013 not an otter, or a bear, or a daddy \u2013 in the same way <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/hockney\" title=\"\">David Hockney</a> isn\u2019t a painter associated with a specific movement. As the Hockney of gays, I wonder if there\u2019s also any mileage in the type of black person I can be? Not explicitly my father\u2019s type, but one of my own.</p> <p><em><strong>I\u2019m Jamaican pigmentally,</strong></em> but too anxious about the island\u2019s approach to homosexuality to get on a flight to Kingston. I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be safe as houses at a luxury resort, but that doesn\u2019t scream finding yourself, does it? It\u2019s hard to connect with your roots while sipping Mount Gay from a coconut by the pool. I\u2019m Rastafarian in name (my initials deliberately spell RAS), but not versed in the religion at all. I love reggae, but is there anything whiter than reggae?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My father and I are two circles that don\u2019t know how to overlap</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My personality is always on my sleeve, my emotions written all over my face. My eyebrows will tell you when I\u2019m ecstatic. And it\u2019s crystal clear when I\u2019m displeased. I\u2019m easy to read, like a <a href=\"https://www.millsandboon.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Mills &amp; Boon</a> or the <em>Sun</em>. I\u2019m, what you might call, a lot. I always want another bite of the cherry. Enough cherries to get diabetes. My dad is pure charisma, too. Very, very dryly funny and thoughtful. But even at five or six, I manufactured a lessness to appease him. Medical grade introversion. Less keen to dance. Less gobby. Less Raven Smith. Visiting my dad in London always came with a side order of a slight suppression of the self. A quieter, more subdued boy would return with his mother on the train.</p> <p>Speaking of which, my dad once dreaded my hair and my mum spent the entire train journey back home painfully combing the wax out.</p> <p><em><strong>Suddenly feeling the</strong></em> low-level hum that he should dutifully be included in my nuptials, I went to see my dad just before I got married, after a five-year break. I could still feel the sting of his words as I entered the flat. Not black enough. His questioning of my blackness wasn\u2019t strictly about race, it was a questioning of my relationship with him. He was the source of blackness in my life and he could feel me slipping away at seven. A great man, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\" title=\"\">Windrushed</a> here at 14. But his fathering style wasn\u2019t the type that celebrated a high-spirited child who needed channelling rather than being dammed up. I was coursing away from him and he couldn\u2019t stop the flow.</p> <p>My father and I were, and still are, two circles of a Venn diagram that couldn\u2019t work out how to overlap. I always felt like this man never really \u201cgot me\u201d, that by some splice of DNA I came out of the womb attached umbilically to his sense of disappointment. I was never tough enough. I was never straight enough. I was never black enough. But the truth is, I was never close enough either. Circumstances separated us and misfired attempts at communication, with a focus on racial identity, kept us apart. You\u2019re not black enough should have really been you\u2019re not here enough.

  "<p>This may come as a surprise, but I have a day job of sorts (I\u2019m an editor for a global group of employment lawyers). I know that nice Mr Sunak said freelance journalists earn about \u00a3200,000 a year when he announced his support package for the self-employed last month, but I don\u2019t know what happened to mine. Was I mis-sold a heap of PPI? Maybe I bought too many avocado toasts and flat whites. Isn\u2019t that how my millennial brethren mislaid the houses they were supposed to own? Either way, my side hustle is indispensable.</p> <p>Apologies for this unlovely insight into how the word-sausage gets made, but lots of people who write full time have a bit on the side, doing things we wouldn\u2019t necessarily boast about at literary parties. It\u2019s hardly news that journalism is beleaguered, rates low and work spread thin. I occasionally used to beat myself up about not having the courage and talent to live entirely from my creative endeavours; no longer.

I have never met most of my colleagues, but I find myself feeling oddly tender towards them. The glib \u201cThanks and kind regards\u201d I used to send their inbox avatars no longer cuts it; I\u2019ve adopted a genuinely sincere \u201cBest wishes\u201d. Usually strictly business, we have taken to tentatively slipping a personal touch into emails. \u201cTake care,\u201d someone writes from Luxembourg. \u201cStay safe,\u201d ends a message from Mexico.</p> <p>I\u2019m fascinated by a sparsely populated Instagram feed with pictures of us in makeshift home offices, laptops on piles of books and balanced on the corners of kitchen tables (physios will have a field day when we all get out). Who would have imagined the rigorously professional X has a small fluffy lapdog? It\u2019s an odd and rather lovely consolation to have work humanised like this; to see we are parents or cat owners; to inspect each other\u2019s mugs. We\u2019re all South Korea commentator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/20/robert-kelly-south-korea-bbc-kids-gatecrash-viral-storm\" title=\"\">Robert Kelly</a> or shadow chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/06/shadow-chancellor-tv-interview-gatecrashed-daughter-sky-news-anneliese-dodds\" title=\"\">Anneliese Dodds</a> now, kids waltzing through our Team meetings and making a mockery of our key performance indicators.</p> <p>My side hustle is in one of the industries that is particularly busy currently, so I have been working more or less non-stop since the first rumblings of Covid-19 hit Europe. Colleagues across the world are doing the same; I get emails on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings; at 4 or 5am on weekdays. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s been hard work, because anyone who is not putting their life and health in danger has forfeited the right to say that now. It\u2019s not NHS hard; not Asda-checkout hard. I just get up every morning, sit at my computer and work all day; I had my first half-day off this weekend for a month.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My family are bemused at my commitment to keeping the hamster wheel of capitalism turning</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is the opposite of a complaint: it\u2019s an acknowledgement of my great good fortune. It might be nice to do a wrist workout trying to lift <em>The Mirror and the Light</em>, or see if I can still murder an easy Chopin prelude, but it\u2019s far nicer to have scaffolding for these shapeless days, and a bit of economic security.</p> <p>My family are bemused at my commitment to keeping the hamster wheel of capitalism turning, but for me, work is identity and sanity. When my best friend and I fantasise about winning the lottery, she says she would stop working in an instant, but I can\u2019t imagine happiness without it. Retirement is theoretical \u2013 I seem to have mislaid my pension, along with that \u00a3200,000 \u2013 but I dread the thought of it anyway.</p> <p>It goes without saying that only some types of work can be a salvation: the ones that are safe, humanely organised and pay a living wage. Our current situation has created and amplified the gaping, uneasy gulfs in the way we work, as it has in so many things. The distribution of work is feast or famine and it\u2019s as unfair as that of other resources. Key workers are frighteningly overburdened, keeping us safe, fed, alive; gig economy workers without job stability or sick pay are working past exhaustion and through illness. Meanwhile many have seen work vanish entirely, or become a logistical impossibility. Friends who invented themselves as nimble, multi-hyphen hustlers \u2013 more because permanent jobs were impossible to find than through any real conviction \u2013 made a virtue out of necessity. Now they are negotiating labyrinthine universal credit applications and facing a deeply uncertain future.</p> <p>Can we do better? We must. We\u2019ve now seen the real people behind the professional fronts we\u2019ve been putting up; swapped grateful emojis with our delivery drivers and shy smiles with supermarket cashiers; cooed over our colleagues\u2019 babies and spotted their grubby tea towels (just me? Maybe). Now we need to take that knowledge and use it to make work more human. </p> <p><em>Follow Emma on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BelgianWaffling?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@BelgianWaffling</a></em></p>"
