  "<p>The screenwriter behind a new drama based on the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? coughing scandal has revealed he has doubts over whether Charles Ingram and his wife were guilty of cheating and said class and their accents may have contributed to their vilification.</p> <p>The British army major was convicted alongside his wife, Diana, after a court ruled that he won the \u00a31m prize in 2001 with help from a fellow contestant, Tecwen Whittock, using a series of strategic coughs to indicate the correct answer.</p> <p>In an interview with Radio Times, the writer James Graham said the fact the couple were \u201crelatively privileged, white and middle class\u201d made them \u201cperfect tabloid fodder\u201d for people to project hatred towards.</p> <p>\u201cObviously all three were found guilty,\u201d Graham said. \u201cBut the story isn\u2019t as clear cut as the majority of people think. Whether they did it or they didn\u2019t do it, I think what happened in the studio that night isn\u2019t black and white. There is new evidence and other older evidence that hasn\u2019t really been presented to the public before and it points towards the Ingrams\u2019 innocence.\u201d</p> <p>Graham, who has adapted his play Quiz into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/16/itv-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-scandal-major-michael-sheen-chris-tarrant\">drama for ITV</a> starring Matthew Macfadyen and Sian Clifford, said the Ingrams and Whittock never spent any time together and had only had one eight-minute phone call before the show.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the military, so there\u2019s an air of privilege around them but also, maybe, gullibility, or innocence and naivety,\u201d added Graham. \u201cAnd that makes them ripe for the media to enjoy putting them in the stocks and throwing vegetables at them. I think one of the things we want to question is whether the mockery and humiliation they endured was proportionate to what they were accused of doing. A million pounds is serious, of course, but it\u2019s also just a game. Nobody died.\u201d</p> <p>He said Whittock\u2019s cough was a result of an asthmatic condition. \u201cWould you pick someone who has an uncontrollable cough to cough at specific moments, during a really tense gameshow? Maybe you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Graham.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0da0acff61106ca8704123588b1109e43ab0271\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0da0acff61106ca8704123588b1109e43ab0271/328_0_3969_2381/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Macfadyen and Sian Clifford in a scene from Quiz\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Macfadyen and Sian Clifford in a scene from Quiz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Frost/ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Peaky Blinders actor Helen McCrory, who features in Quiz as Sonia Woodley QC, the lawyer who defended Ingram, said she too felt uncertainty about the scandal.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that a lot of people at the time didn\u2019t hear the cough \u2026 Chris Tarrant didn\u2019t hear the cough, the person sitting opposite didn\u2019t hear the cough, people either side didn\u2019t hear the cough, yet for some reason he [Ingram] heard the cough,\u201d she told the Mirror.</p> <p>During his appearance on the quiz show, which aired in September 2001, Ingram at times wavered between possible answers, appearing to settle on one before switching to another.</p> <p>After he won, the show\u2019s production company, Celador, suspended payment of the prize after accusing him and his wife of defrauding the show along with Whittock.</p> <p>Following a trial at Southwark crown court in 2003, the three defendants were convicted by a majority verdict and given suspended sentences and fined. Ingram was later forced to resign his commission as a major by the army board.

These populations are also more likely to vote Democrat.</p> <p>The Guardian also interviewed 100 people on the list and found that over a third either hadn\u2019t moved at all, or had moved locally.

Wisconsin and other states are now pushing mail-in balloting rather than voting in person. But if voters are erroneously dropped from the rolls, they might never receive those ballots in the first place. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Divider\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Divider</a> </figure>  <p><strong>In 2016, Wisconsin joined the Electronic Registration Information Center (Eric)</strong>, a multi-state partnership that helps its members keep their voter rolls current by comparing data between government sources such as the post office and Department of Motor Vehicles, to see who might have moved home. A year later, Wisconsin deactivated roughly 308,000 registrations, but eventually, the state <a href=\"https://www.wiscontext.org/navigating-confusion-wisconsins-voter-roll-purge\">reinstated</a> approximately 7,000 voters who were erroneously struck off.</p> <p>In 2019, the state decided it wouldn\u2019t remove voters from the rolls until 2021, to avoid making the same mistake before this year\u2019s presidential election. Yet in November, the Wisconsin Institute for Law &amp; Liberty (<a href=\"https://www.will-law.org/\">Will</a>), a conservative non-profit law firm, sued the Wisconsin elections commission, claiming it violated state law by putting off the cancellations.</p> <p>The removals have so far continued to be blocked, but Will is asking the Wisconsin supreme court to hear the case before the election.</p> <p>Will\u2019s president, Rick Esenberg, has argued that the process won\u2019t disenfranchise voters because they can register at the polls <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx\">on election day</a>.

But despite this, she was refused a property that she could afford, in her preferred location, purely on the grounds that she received some of her income from state security benefits.</p> <p>\u201cI really felt like there was a total lack of understanding from the letting agent, even though I\u2019d explained I was a really good tenant and that [moving out of the village] meant uprooting my children again, changing school, losing work and community links completely unnecessarily,\u201d she says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to listen and they had no interest in my employment, my income, my savings or situation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b259eb6f66cbe88bf5cab103f362036735612c8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b259eb6f66cbe88bf5cab103f362036735612c8c/0_134_533_666/400.jpg\" alt=\"SUPPORTING1 Amanda 1 DSS Discrimination \u00a9 Shelter Alexandra Smart 2019\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Despite offering a year\u2019s rent in advance, Amanda Staples was refused because of her benefit status.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexandra Smart/Shelter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Staples\u2019 experience is far from unique. A 2019 YouGov survey found that 54% of private renters in England who receive housing benefit (equating to 820,000 people) say they have been unable to rent a home because the property was advertised as <a href=\"https://blog.shelter.org.uk/2018/08/ending-dss-discrimination/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cNo DSS\u201d</a>. The knock-on effect of this discrimination is much less choice in the private rental market for those who need housing benefit, often leaving them with little option than to put up with properties that are in disrepair or unsuitable in other ways, or face the threat of homelessness.</p> <p>In 2017, Rosie Keogh, a single mother in Birmingham, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/no-benefits-landlords-rosie-keogh-sex-discrimination\">won \u00a32,000 compensation</a> from a letting agency with the help of Shelter\u2019s strategic litigation team. The agent had refused to consider her as a tenant because she received housing benefit, despite her unblemished 11-year record as a private renter. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42979242\" rel=\"nofollow\">Keogh told the BBC</a> it made her feel like a second-class citizen: \u201cI felt something had to be done to challenge it. I was motivated by anger at such inequitable practice \u2026 it\u2019s women and women with children who are bearing the brunt of this because they need to work part time.\u201d Later that year, a Shelter investigation found that <a href=\"https://england.shelter.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/1581687/Stop_DSS_Discrimination_-_Ending_prejudice_against_renters_on_housing_benefit.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">five out of six </a>letting agent brands had an outright ban on renters on housing benefit in at least one of their branches, and almost half (48%) had no properties available for housing benefit claimants at all.</p> <p>With a chronic shortage of social housing in the UK, such policies leave families with few other options and Shelter has campaigned hard on the issue to accelerate change. The End DSS Discrimination campaign has had a number of <a href=\"https://blog.shelter.org.uk/2018/11/stop-dss-discrimination-live-blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">significant successes</a>, including convincing NatWest, The Co-Operative Bank and Metro Bank to change the terms of their buy-to-let mortgages, which had precluded landlords from renting to housing benefit tenants (all other major lenders followed suit). Nationwide Building Society, having changed its policy in 2013, also contacted any mortgage holders with a historic \u201cNo DSS\u201d clause to reassure them that it would never be enforced.<em> </em>Further to this<em>, </em>Zoopla and Right Move agreed to ban the inclusion of \u201cno DSS\u201d conditions on their listings; and an update by the Competition and Markets Authority to the consumer protection law for lettings professionals now includes clarification on DSS discrimination.</p> <p>Over the past 18 months, Shelter\u2019s strategic litigation team has played a central role, working as part of the campaign team to coordinate <a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/work-and-pensions-committee/no-dss-discrimination-against-benefit-claimants-in-the-housing-sector/written/97946.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">legal challenges</a> to the policies and practices of letting agents, banks, and landlords, as well as counsel affected tenants to take their complaint further if they are willing. \u201cPart of the work of the strategic litigation team is to be horizon scanners,\u201d says Jo Underwood, head of strategic litigation at Shelter. \u201cTo take a step back and monitor the common legal problems coming up in each Shelter office, liaise with our national campaigns and media teams \u2026 to tackle systemic failures in a more proactive and efficient way. Even a settlement out of court can be a step in the right direction because we can publicise that and show other landlords and agents they\u2019re using unlawful practices and running the risk of a court case.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1a70c83cbf79036bbc73c4c913c14f7fcc28c1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1a70c83cbf79036bbc73c4c913c14f7fcc28c1a/15_42_1069_642/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rose Arnall, the solicitor embedded into the campaign, says legal action is just one tool to achieve change.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rose Arnall, the solicitor embedded into the campaign, says legal action is just one tool to achieve change.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shelter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shelter\u2019s legal team spans its 15 locations across England, works with the telephone and online advice services, and includes 40 solicitors and 30 legal advisers and paralegals. As part of its services, Shelter offers free legal advice via its Housing Possession Court Duty Scheme. Funded by the Legal Aid Agency, anyone facing eviction or a claim for possession can access legal advice or representation from a Shelter solicitor in courts across the country. There are four solicitors on the strategic litigation team itself. Rose Arnall, the solicitor embedded into the End DSS Discrimination campaign team, says often an appropriately worded letter can be enough to encourage agents to change their practices.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/shelter-supporting-those-who-are-struggling/2020/apr/06/until-they-got-involved-i-was-beginning-to-think-this-was-the-end-of-me-how-shelter-changes-the-lives-of-those-in-need\">\u2018Until they got involved I was beginning to think this was the end of me\u2019: how Shelter changes the lives of those in need</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had the Equality Act since 2010 so it does surprise me when we receive replies from landlords and agents and they don\u2019t know how it applies to them, or they had no idea there\u2019s such a thing as indirect discrimination,\u201d she says. Indirect discrimination occurs when a practice is not, on the face of it, directly discriminatory, but puts people with a protected characteristic (such as gender or disability) at a particular disadvantage.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality of how these practices impact people is that because women and those with disabilities are more likely to be in receipt of benefits than others, they are the ones who are more likely to be made homeless and not find a home as a result of this exclusion,\u201d says Arnall. \u201cOver the past two years I\u2019ve had an increasing number of clients reveal to me how their housing problems are contributing to stress, anxiety and severe depression.\u201d</p> <p>Thousands tell Shelter they have been impacted by No DSS policies, but only some feel able to take on the hard task of enforcing their right to equal treatment through bringing a legal case.</p> <p>Of those who do enter the courts, not all those who wish to report or challenge these practices have kept detailed records of what happened. \u201cPeople don\u2019t necessarily identify what they\u2019ve experienced as a legal problem\u201d, says Arnall of the cases they hear about.</p> <p>Other challenges include accessing legal aid funding, and a requirement that any complaint must be filed with the court no more than six months after the discrimination occurred. The design of the Equality Act itself, which relies on the victims of discrimination being the ones to enforce it, makes bringing legal action against unscrupulous letting agents even more difficult. For those with complex needs, this can be yet another barrier to redress.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a large task, you can see why the people who carry the cases forward tend to be incredibly determined,\u201d Arnall says. \u201cThey\u2019re not in it for compensation, they\u2019re not in it for themselves \u2013 they just know firsthand the unnecessary unfairness and injustice of these practices, and they want to see the end to them.\u201d</p> <p>Represented by Arnall, Staples would eventually take legal action against the letting agent and landlord that refused to consider her as a tenant. The case totaled \u00a313,000 in compensation, legal and court costs, and the agents issued a public apology. Since then, Staples and her family have been offered a secure social home in the same village and are now happily settled. \u201cThe rule of no DSS shows such ignorance,\u201d she says. \u201c[Being in receipt of benefits] could happen to anybody.\u201d</p> <p><em>Head to <a href=\"https://england.shelter.org.uk/support_us/campaigns/dss\" rel=\"nofollow\">england.shelter.org.uk</a> to find out how you can help end DSS discrimination</em></p>",
  "<p>Tracey Emin has gone from fear and numbness to angrily shouting at a stranger to losing herself in painting, her lockdown diary reveals.</p> <p>The artist has been sharing her life on Instagram with a daily diary of written thoughts, images and short film from her bathroom and studio.</p> <p>The diary was commissioned by White Cube gallery and will be followed by week-long Instagram diaries from other artists including Antony Gormley and Sarah Morris.</p> <p>Susan May, the gallery\u2019s artistic director, said it was a way of staying connected with voices \u201cwho often help us to look at the world in a different way\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCollective experience is something artists are able to communicate so effectively, and at a time when so many of us are confined in ways beyond our control, art and artists can in some way help us try to make sense of the situation.\u201d</p> <p>Emin\u2019s diary is, typically, rawly autobiographical.

By <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-cjPUigxk9/\">day seven</a>, \u201cthe last day for now\u201d, she had painted \u201cI wanted you to fuck me so much I couldn\u2019t paint any more\u201d on the artwork.</p> <p>The Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones said the diary was \u201cnot just a trenchant response to these frightening times but a subtle meditation on how art can rise to them\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt starts out as an apparently random account of her self-isolation at her Spitalfields home, but becomes a short story about the life of an artist. It\u2019s actually rather optimistic because it shows how to exist in solitude \u2013 inside your feelings, your perceptions, your creativity.\u201d</p> <p>Jones noted that the epic canvas Emin was working on kept getting blacker. \u201cShe can\u2019t stop herself slapping on more black. In a plague year, is there any other colour to paint?\u201d</p> <p>Emin is one of a number of contemporary artists using Instagram during the lockdown. Damien Hirst\u2019s posts are cheerful insights from the studio about the way he works. On Wednesday he wrote \u201cI love paint\u201d and posted a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-ZvxLWHWmZ/\">short film from his studio</a> on progress with new enormous cherry blossom paintings.</p> <p>The trunks and branches of the trees he painted were too thick, he said. The solution? Painting blue lines of sky showing through the middle of them. \u201cIt\u2019s building up layers,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t like these until now.\u201d</p> <p>Other artists are giving practical advice. Kara Walker, the American artist whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/30/kara-walker-turbine-hall-review-a-shark-infested-monument-to-the-victims-of-british-slavery\">giant fountain</a> filled Tate Modern\u2019s Turbine Hall until its closure, has been posting #confinementbookclub tips, the latest being Wade Davis\u2019s The Serpent and the Rainbow.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/bob-and-roberta-smith\">artist Bob and Roberta Smith</a> has been posting regular #StayAtHome art tasks such as, on Friday morning, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-glT2NFQW_/\">painting </a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-glT2NFQW_/\">clouds</a> and a statement to a loved one.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI think artists, writers, poets, musicians, composers have a responsibility to keep working and keep doing things. Other people are continuing to work, NHS workers, the corner shop, refuse workers \u2026 so we should. It\u2019s important because it is now that people really understand what culture is all about.\u201d </p>"
