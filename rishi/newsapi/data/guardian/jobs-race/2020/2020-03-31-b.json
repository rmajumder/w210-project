The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index published by China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics increased to 52.0 this month, up from a record-low level of 35.7 in February on a scale where a reading above 50.0 separates economic growth from contraction.</p> <p>Service sector activity also recovered as shopping centres and retail outlets reopen, with the PMI index increasing to 52.3 from 29.6 in February.</p> <p>Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments, said China had demonstrated that economic growth could bounce back strongly from the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>\u201cWe still have long months of battle as the US has just started dealing with it.

While the recovery could be swift, there are rising fears of a long-term hit to jobs and growth.</p> <p>Vicky Redwood, a senior economic adviser at the consultancy Capital Economics, warned that consumer and business confidence could remain subdued as the return to relative normality takes time to take hold, not least if fears of a second wave of the virus linger. She said some companies would struggle to repay emergency loans, austerity policies could be used to control rising government debt levels, and demand for foreign travel might remain subdued for years.</p> <p>\u201cIt may well take a few years to get back to where we were and even longer for some economies,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>These days, simply leaving your home to buy food is a gamble. That\u2019s why countless people are calling services like Instacart, which delivers groceries, to spare them a trip to the supermarket. I\u2019ve been an Instacart worker for nearly two years in the Newark/New York area and I\u2019ve never experienced such stress, chaos and craziness. My stomach goes into knots before going into stores because I never know if today will be the day I contract Covid-19 or, worse, spread it to a customer. That is why many of us are striking for better working conditions, including paid sick leave.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/31/amazon-strike-worker-fired-organizing-walkout-chris-smallls\">Amazon fires New York worker who led strike over coronavirus concerns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Right now, contract workers who shop and deliver orders to customers\u2019 homes are risking our health by doing our jobs. Hand sanitizer, wipes and hazard pay should be given to anyone who is working right now under these conditions, but that is not the case. While Instacart has no problem giving these protections to so-called \u201cin-store shoppers\u201d \u2013 Instacart employees who are based in stores, and get orders ready for customers for pick up \u2013 they have completely looked past the contract workers like me, called full service shoppers, who travel to the store, shop the order and deliver it to customers.</p> <p>Without shoppers, Instacart is nothing but an app. We spend our days in and out of stores so that customers can stay home and not risk their health. We deal with the crowds, out-of-stock items, item limits and upset customers when their products aren\u2019t all available.</p> <p>The company reportedly wants to hire 300,000 more shoppers to be put at risk instead of paying shoppers who already work for the company fair wages. (We have no set hourly pay. We get paid per order.) It\u2019s not rare for shoppers like me to see triple batches (three orders in one) that can pay as low as $7 all together, including the 60\u00a2 per mile Instacart says they pay us from store to customer. Going out for such little pay is a real slap in the face. To think that Instacart ever thought we deserved such low pay is disgusting, but especially now, with this pandemic, you would think they would pay us better. But that\u2019s simply not the case.</p> <ul> <li><p>Sarah Polito is an Instacart worker</p></li> </ul>"
