  "<p>Few people would deny that the most successful white wine of the past decade has been New Zealand sauvignon blanc, least of all the Kiwis themselves. The transformation of the Marlborough region in the north of South Island into what is, in effect, a gigantic grape farm has been the wine world\u2019s equivalent of the gold rush. With a reliably sunny climate, prolific yields and a simple vinification process (there\u2019s no expensive oak in most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/feb/26/new-zealand-sauvignon-blanc-wine-fiona-beckett\">savvy blancs</a>), this is probably one of the most profitable wines ever made. Which is, of course, why it accounts for some 86% of the country\u2019s wine exports.</p> <p>But \u2013 and you guessed there would be a but, didn\u2019t you? \u2013 it\u2019s become, dare I say, a tiny bit boring. Many of the country\u2019s top producers have recognised that, too, which is why today\u2019s sauvignons, especially those from the excellent 2019 vintage, are just that bit more restrained, more nuanced, less in-yer-face. They\u2019re even trotting out older vintages \u2013 a development I\u2019m not totally convinced by, but is all about getting the message across that sauvignon can be serious.</p> <p>Still, the Kiwis don\u2019t want to be defined by sauvignon alone, not least in case we all suddenly fall out of love with it, so they\u2019re intent on proving they can turn their hand to other varieties as well. In terms of whites, that means aromatic grapes such as riesling, pinot gris (which is made in the rich, often off-dry Alsace style), gew\u00fcrztraminer and, perhaps surprisingly, Austria\u2019s gr\u00fcner veltliner. But although these play well to the home market, which, from a culinary point of view at least, is far more connected to Asia than to Europe, they\u2019re never going to replace sauvignon blanc in our affections.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/22/20-best-vegan-wines-supermarkets-online\">The 20 best vegan wines</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are two varieties that might, however. One is chardonnay, which is undergoing something of a revival in New Zealand due to the focus of quality production shifting from Hawkes Bay to Central Otago (also home of pinot noir, which I\u2019ll talk about next week) and Marlborough, which must be galling, because they pulled a whole lot of it up not too long ago. Admittedly, it doesn\u2019t come cheap, and not all of it is available here (I\u2019m thinking Gibbston Valley\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gibbstonvalley.com/nz/shop/wines/single-vineyard/2017-china-terrace-95-chardonnay/\" title=\"\">China Terrace 95</a>, in particular), but it is pretty bloody gorgeous.</p> <p>But if I had to put money on what New Zealand\u2019s next rising star will be, it\u2019s albari\u00f1o. True, there\u2019s not a lot of it about (not yet, anyway), but it\u2019s delicious, slightly fruitier than you find in Galicia, though equally as crisp and saline, all of which make it as appealing to the pinot grigio drinker as to the sauvignon blanc one.

  "<p>British motor racing was a different kind of deal in the 1930s \u2013 both more amateur and more aristocratic than it is today, and certainly more dangerous. It tended to involve men who had been to famous public schools, and knew how to handle a shotgun on a Yorkshire moor or a yacht on the Solent.</p> <p>They had names like Cholmondeley and Featherstonhaugh, unless they were Siamese princes (which they sometimes were). They went to Cambridge but didn\u2019t excel, or they crashed out completely, because they were more interested in driving fast cars while thinking about how to acquire even faster ones. At weekends they raced their MGs, Rileys and ERAs \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/jan/17/maserati-250f-perfect-racing-machine\" title=\"\">Maseratis</a> and Bugattis too \u2013 up twisting hill climbs in the Malverns, or round the track at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/nov/03/uk-motorsports-brooklands-driving\" title=\"\">Brooklands</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/may/05/donington-park-british-grand-prix-formula-one\" title=\"\">Donington Park</a>.</p> <p>Abroad as well. Some owned aeroplanes. South Africa? No problem. They shipped the cars in advance, then flew down by biplane, swooping low to admire a herd of elephants or find out where they were. Throw in glamorous women, picnics, gallons of champagne, jazz, skiing, a spot of shark fishing \u2026 you get the picture. This is an awful lot more fun than <em>Top Gear</em>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/observer/osm/story/0,6903,782811,00.html\" title=\"\">Dick Seaman</a> was one such chap. Perhaps not the most colourful of them, but what he lacked in charisma, he made up for with talent. Meticulous, cool with a hint of ruthlessness, he was among the greatest of the era. He would surely have been the Lewis Hamilton of his day had he not been tragically killed in an accident at the Belgian Grand Prix at the age of 26.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0e6acde527afd81a7c72f2274d45e6059cb8178c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e6acde527afd81a7c72f2274d45e6059cb8178c/0_537_3285_4101/801.jpg\" alt=\"Dick Seaman.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dick Seaman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: World History Archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They died in their droves, these men, spinning off the track, into walls and trees, and the crowd, killing them too. Racing went on. It was a lack of health and safety gone mad. Meanwhile, Europe edged closer to a precipice. Germany\u2019s new chancellor, Adolf Hitler, opened the 1933 Berlin motor show with promises of new roads, a people\u2019s car, tax cuts for drivers. And state sponsored motor racing. For the next six years the teams of Auto Union and Mercedes-Benz would dominate international grand prix racing.</p> <p>It was no accident that Seaman ended up behind the wheel of a Mercedes Silver Arrow. The handsome young Englishman\u2019s talent and ambition made him a perfect fit. But as the decade progressed, the political situation made everything awkward. He met Hitler, shook his hand, attended rallies, gave the salute (even if it was a bashful British version of it). He was doing brilliantly, was going places fast; he loved his life and his beautiful young German bride Erica Popp \u2013 how bad could things get? His death, while leading at Spa, on 29 June 1939, came just before war did.</p> <p>This is a tale for the enthusiast, but by no means exclusively. Yes, there are mentions of plugs and pistons, tappets and timing; but there is also a brilliant Italian mechanic named Giulio working away in Seaman\u2019s Knightsbridge garage, adjusting those tappets to get the engine timing (of a French Delage, this was pre Silver Arrow) just right. If you don\u2019t know what a Delage looks like, look it up and picture these beautiful lethal silver machines hurtling around \u2013 and off \u2013 the N\u00fcrburgring.</p> <p>Readers of the Guardian, where Richard Williams was chief sports writer for many years (as well as covering music, film, books and just about everything else) and to which he still contributes, will be familiar with the elegance of his prose and the breadth of his interests and expertise. All are on show here. The story is less of a single-seater joy ride focusing only on the track ahead, but more a leisurely parade lap with Williams at the wheel of something more refined. There\u2019s time to savour the sights, a scene, a time, people. Seaman\u2019s mother Lilian \u2013 who couldn\u2019t accept her son\u2019s German wife and whose social climbing exploits raise an eyebrow is especially splendid.</p> <p>As well as English country houses, German house parties and luxury ocean liners, the tour takes in politics and the fascinating interface between sport and world affairs. Why are there no Italian teams at the French Grand Prix in 1936? Punishment for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1935/oct/03/italy.mainsection\" title=\"\">Mussolini\u2019s invasion of Abyssinia</a>, of course.</p> <p>And the big black cloud looming? Well actually there are two. One is full of the rain that will turn the Spa track into wet death, causing Seaman\u2019s car to spin out of control and strike a tree broadside, before bursting into flames. The other is heavy with hatred, and with death on a far greater scale.</p> <p>\u2022<em> A Race With Love and Death is publihed by Simon &amp; Schuster (RRP \u00a320).
