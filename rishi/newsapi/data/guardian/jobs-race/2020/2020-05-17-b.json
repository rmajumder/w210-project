  "<p>As many as 6 million people in Britain fear losing their job within six months as the coronavirus outbreak causes the biggest economic shock in living memory, a study has warned.</p> <p>With much of business and social life at a standstill despite gradual steps to reopen the economy, the Centre for Labour and Social Studies (Class) said workers feared the coronavirus recession would be worse than the 2008 financial crash.</p> <p>As many as one in five people in a survey of 2,000 workers by Survation for the leftwing thinktank said they were worried about losing their jobs, despite government efforts to cushion the blow using its wage subsidy scheme.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Extended by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/12/uk-furlough-scheme-extended-rishi-sunak-coronavirus\">until October</a> to avoid spiralling job losses this summer, the government is subsidising about 7.5m jobs at almost 1m companies through the furlough programme.</p> <p>After just two full days of its operation more than a million self-employed workers made claims for over \u00a33bn in emergency support through a similar scheme for people who work for themselves.</p> <p>However, the survey found that 60% of workers are just three months or less away from defaulting on their rent or mortgage, suggesting the scheme has not stopped people feeling that they are perilously close to disaster.</p> <p>The report follows evidence that almost a third of Britain\u2019s lowest-paid workers have lost their job or been furloughed in the past two months, while job losses are starting to rise for those missing out on the government support schemes. Surveys from the Office for National Statistics also indicate more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/almost-half-of-uk-firms-could-run-out-of-money-within-six-months\">80% of the public expect their financial situation to deteriorate</a> or stay the same in the next year, as the pandemic triggers the worst global recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s.</p> <p>Class urged the government to launch a job creation scheme and substantial spending stimulus to refocus the economy, calling for Britain to grow its way out of the slump with well-paid green jobs.</p> <p>Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said the survey highlighted how stressful life was on low wages and with insecure work. \u201cLife has become harder still in the Covid-19 crisis \u2013 especially for those on the frontline.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough the problems these workers face have existed for many years, the Covid-19 crisis has laid them bare for all to see. And it has intensified the injustice.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The trades union-funded thinktank also found widespread public support for giving key workers, including NHS staff, care workers, shop workers and delivery drivers a pay rise. At the same time 69% of those polled supported taxing the wealthy more to help pay for the crisis.</p> <p>Faiza Shaheen, director of Class, said: \u201cProtecting workers now requires us looking past emergency measures to a recovery plan. Coronavirus has put society in an X-ray machine to reveal its structural weakness and is now magnifying existing inequalities.</p> <p>\u201cIt is up to the chancellor to seize this opportunity, to build a bridge from the furlough scheme and unemployment benefits to green jobs and a fairer society.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The UK is at risk of returning to the high unemployment levels of the 1980s, according to the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist.</p> <p>Andy Haldane said Britain would need to find a way to reabsorb the large numbers of workers who will lose their jobs due to the coronavirus pandemic, as the country faces the prospect of the high unemployment experienced decades ago.</p> <p>\u201cThe very reason I got into economics and the reason I got into public policy was because of the scarring experience of the early 80s unemployment, which peaked at three and a bit million \u2013 and we\u2019re going back to that basically,\u201d he said in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph.</p> <p>\u201cThose fears are going to be cast over a much wider cohort of the workforce, maybe as much as half of them.

  "<p>Last week\u2019s episode saw the exit of one of Drag Race\u2019s most memorable contestants ever, Heidi Aphrodite (nee Hydrates, nee Ho, nee N Closet). She\u2019s one of those contestants where winning doesn\u2019t really matter, she was always going to do well out of this. Coming to a post-lockdown drag brunch near you! \u201cSmashed avocado?! I\u2019m just smashed!\u201d</p> <p>This week, the end is nigh. We\u2019re down to the final five. According to our <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/rupauls-drag-race-season-12-finale-details/?fbclid=IwAR3hGLF8j2i6zbnk3SZeTLBIQ4J3nq4uohfIfBv1kmN_YKh5Z677ZzFti4o\">intel</a>, there\u2019s a reunion episode next week, then the finale IS happening the week after. Apparently it\u2019s already been filmed, and involves \u201cboundary-pushing technology\u201d (Zoom) as well as a lip-sync for the crown. This sounds like it has the potential to be either disastrous or groundbreaking, which is fitting because that\u2019s how Drag Race series one was probably pitched.</p> <h2>What happens in Vegas \u2026</h2> <p>We\u2019re back in the workroom and Jaida is crying one perfect viscous column of mascara as she laments Heidi\u2019s elimination. The power goes out, cutting Jaida off mid-sentence and we\u2019re expecting it to be some sort of twist, but no, it really is just ... a power cut. That the editors decided to keep in. OK!</p> <p>This week\u2019s main theme/challenge/aesthetic/shameless promotional tool is VEGAS! As the most Vegas-y queen in her look and training, Jaida has a distinct advantage. Perhaps the showrunners took this into account when planning the theme for the episode. Perhaps not. Now, this is an aspect of US drag that\u2019s somewhat lost in translation over here. Yes, we\u2019ve seen Priscilla Queen Of The Desert, and yes, we\u2019ve watched grainy YouTube shots of Jennifer Lopez throwing herself around at Planet Hollywood, but largely, that glitzy, rhinestone, tassled, show pony drag is something we\u2019re not particular familiar with and don\u2019t particularly enjoy. It\u2019s all just a bit ... vulgar. Perhaps there ARE lots of UK Vegas fans and you disagree: please feel free to vent in the comments below.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9990450c427b5fd7e8bdfeb56d64810cc79f8168\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9990450c427b5fd7e8bdfeb56d64810cc79f8168/476_115_663_398/500.jpg\" alt=\"RuPaul\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">RuPaul, sashay away.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VH1</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the mini-challenge, the girls are given 30 minutes to create a headdress and get into drag. All the girls look amazing and are all being hilarious and just beautiful. As Ru said last week, this really is the best crop of girls in a long time. Gigi deservingly wins, for a look that would\u2019ve made Leonardo DiCaprio spill his champagne goblet in The Great Gatsby. She wins tickets to see the Drag Race Vegas show. And for the maxichallenge, the girls will be performing a medley of songs from the Drag Race Vegas show. Sigh.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that RuPaul is using this episode as an hour-long advert to sell tickets for his Vegas show. We get that. Drag Race has always had shameless promo, but this is gross. It\u2019s one of the final episodes of the season \u2013 this is when the girls should be given the chance to shine in their own right, not be used as dancing ponies to sell tickets. RuPaul ... sashay away.</p> <h2>Eat, sleep, drag, repeat</h2> <p>\u201cUgh, god ... emotions suck!\u201d We hear you, Gigi! The ladies are understandably having crises of confidence as they plan out how they\u2019re going to perform their free commercials for RuPaul and the judges. They head to the stage to record the vocal section, with two people called Leland and Freddie. Leland says the Vegas show has \u201cpower ballads, showstopping moments and a big finale\u201d. Groundbreaking. Most of the girls grapple with their vocals and lyrics. They\u2019re given advice. They nod. This whole thing is dull. The girls trying to sing is dull. Leland and Freddie are dull. Next!</p> <p>It\u2019s the choreo session, with wonderful Jamal Sims, who we certainly have a crush on. But again, it feels forced and laborious. It\u2019s because we\u2019ve seen all this before. We\u2019ve seen the girls struggling with choreography, and we\u2019re also familiar with their different abilities. It would\u2019ve been great if they\u2019d been given something different that showcased their abilities in a way that hasn\u2019t been done yet. But shout-out to Jackie\u2019s little blue 5am shorts.</p> <p>The girls head back to the workroom and have mirror chats as they get ready for the main stage. They all give each other supportive advice, compliment each other on their various approaches to the artform of drag, and generally just lift each other up with great energy and positive vibes. THIS should be the new face of drag, reality TV and hopefully, as we move into a new, loving, post-pandemic age, the new face of everything. You love to see it.</p> <h2>Take it to the runway!</h2> <p>Ru stalks in looking the most stunning she\u2019s looked this whole season (we say that every week) in an exhaustingly beautiful black gown. Michelle is serving gorgeous air stewardess realness, makeup flawless, hair flawless. Carson Kressley is giving hectic gay at an afterparty, which is why we love him. Ross Mathews is back in pastel, and Jamal is holding his own VERY well, with his gorgeous smile. Hi Jamal.

But the one who shines, is Jaida Essence Hall. She\u2019s going to win the finale \u2013 we\u2019re calling it now.</p> <p>When the Vegas show (finally!) draws to a close, the runway category is \u2013 Eleganza Extravaganza! Crystal is surreal and gorgeous in blue velvet; Gigi comes out in a gawky teen prom dress look, mouth brace and all. \u201cThis is the molar opposite of what she\u2019s worn before,\u201d says Michelle. VERY GOOD! Very Katy Perry TGIF. Jackie Cox\u2019s look is ... a lot. Sherry Pie looks incredible, like she\u2019s fallen out of Steel Magnolias \u2013 an homage to Mae West and quintessential camp. Jaida is, as usual, breathtaking in a louche metallic gown.</p> <h2>Lipsync for your LIFE</h2> <p>Gigi Goode wins this week\u2019s challenge. Jackie Cox and Crystal Methyd are in the bottom two and they lipsync to On The Floor by Jennifer Lopez feat. Pitbull! What a SONG. Add it to your drinking, running and working playlists immediately if you haven\u2019t already. Crystal and Jackie are both having a blast. This is a great lipsync. Jackie goes home. Aaw, bye Jackie.

  "<p>The local prosecutor who argued two white men were legally justified in chasing down and killing Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed black man, has been at the center of aggressive and flawed prosecutions of at least two black women in recent years.</p> <p>One of the women was wrongfully imprisoned for over a decade on a murder conviction secured by later discredited forensic evidence, and another woman was unsuccessfully tried twice for helping people vote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-gregory-mcmichael-records\">\u2018A great embarrassment\u2019: records offer insight into Ahmaud Arbery suspect</a> </p> </aside>  <p>George Barnhill, the district attorney for the Waycross judicial circuit in south-east Georgia, advised police in April that Gregory and Travis McMichael should not be charged over the death of Arbery, <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6916-george-barnhill-letter-to-glyn/b52fa09cdc974b970b79/optimized/full.pdf\">suggesting</a> that the two had attempted to \u201cstop and hold this criminal suspect\u201d before fatally shooting him.</p> <p>Arbery had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia\">been jogging in the area</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.11alive.com/article/news/crime/travis-mcmichael-named-in-2-police-reports-before-arbery-shooting/85-135bab7a-b5bb-40f6-bb1f-3294adb16cda\">numerous accounts</a> stating there was no evidence of any burglary.</p> <p>Barnhill eventually recused himself from the case, under pressure from the Arbery family, as his son had worked in the Brunswick prosecutor\u2019s office alongside Gregory McMichael.</p> <p>The McMichaels have since been charged with murder after the emergence of video showing the shooting and the intervention of Georgia state investigators. Barnhill faces harsh scrutiny, allegations of racial bias and a state investigation over his handling of the case and why he recommended not bringing charges shortly before officially recusing himself. </p> <p>Barnhill defended his office\u2019s handling of the Arbery case.</p> <p>\u201cAs a member of the State Bar of Georgia I am not allowed by State Law and State Bar rules to have any public comment on the facts, or on the law, or on the news stories about the case, to ensure a fair and just trial for all parties,\u201d he said in an emailed statement. \u201cAs far as any investigation into my office\u2019s handling of the case; I welcome the investigation and look forward to the review.\u201d</p> <p>Court documents obtained by the Guardian reveal that just months before Barnhill advised against charging both men, his office aggressively opposed a motion filed on behalf of a 53-year-old African American woman, Sheila Denton, requesting a new trial due to flawed forensic evidence used to convict her of a 2004 murder.</p> <p>Denton was sentenced to life in prison in 2006 for the murder of 73-year-old Eugene Garner, but she has maintained her innocence. Her prosecution, first brought by Barnhill\u2019s predecessor in the district attorney\u2019s office, relied heavily on \u201cbite mark\u201d evidence and the account of a sole witness who defense lawyers said gave conflicting evidence and was heavily pressured by local police into testifying against Denton. Court filings indicate police threatened the witness, Sharon Jones, with being charged over murder herself unless she testified that Denton had confessed to her. Jones was a known crack cocaine dealer and drug addict.</p> <p>An autopsy on Garner\u2019s body identified a potential bite mark, which was used alongside a photograph of Denton\u2019s arm, which prosecutors argued also showed an alleged bite mark, to deduce Denton had carried out the murder. There was no DNA evidence linking her to the case.</p> <p>Although forensic dentistry experts testified at trial that the markings were \u201cprobable bite marks\u201d that linked the two together, <a href=\"http://abfo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ABFO-Bitemark-Standards-03162016.pdf\">guidance issued</a> by the American Board of Forensic Odontology (ABFO) in 2016, which strictly limited testimony on \u201cprobabilistic\u201d bite markings, essentially nullified the critical evidence from the 2006 trial.</p> <p>Despite this, attorneys working for Barnhill argued in court filings in December 2019 that the new ABFO guidance was \u201cnot evidence at all\u201d and the court should continue to rely on the old, flawed testimony because the forensic dentist who testified in 2006 \u201cwould not change the opinion he offered\u201d. The motion was written by the assistant district attorney Michelle McIntire, who reports to Barnhill.</p> <p>Ultimately, on 7 February this year, just two weeks before the Arbery shooting, Judge Dwayne Gillis disagreed with Barnhill\u2019s office and allowed Denton a new trial, later ordering her release from prison.</p> <p>Denton was <a href=\"https://www.innocenceproject.org/sheila-denton-is-freed-after-15-years-of-wrongful-imprisonment/\">released</a> on 9 April but remains under indictment.</p> <p>Sources close to the case told the Guardian that Barnhill indicated, at around the same time he advised against charging the McMichaels, that he would continue to examine pursuing a new case against Denton.</p> <p>Barnhill said in an email that the original trial was \u201cmany years ago\u201d and he was not personally involved. He said his office had agreed to a low bond for Denton after a new trial was ordered so she could live with family in Atlanta.</p> <p>In recent years Barnhill also drew <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/opinion/election-voting-rights-fraud-prosecutions.html\">national attention</a> for his decision to prosecute Olivia Pearson, the first African American woman elected to the city commission in Douglas, Georgia, and three others for improperly assisting others at the polls during the 2012 general election. The three other people pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges, but Pearson chose to take her case to trial.</p> <p>Georgia restricts who can get assistance at the polls and Barnhill\u2019s office brought felony charges against Pearson, saying she had unlawfully helped <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/joelanderson/how-georgias-voter-fraud-fight-could-make-this-grandmother-a\">her nephew</a> and another woman at the polls and signed a form swearing that the voters met the necessary conditions for assistance when they didn\u2019t.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was just blown away that I got indicted on something like that. They aggressively prosecuted me</p> <footer> <cite>Olivia Pearson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But during the trial, one of the women Pearson helped, a first-time voter, testified that she didn\u2019t know how to use the voting machine, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/joelanderson/this-is-what-happened-when-a-georgia-grandmother-went-on\">according to BuzzFeed News</a>. She said Pearson showed her how to do so without touching the machine or telling her how to vote.</p> <p>\u201cI was just blown away that I got indicted on something like that,\u201d said Pearson \u201cThey aggressively prosecuted me.\u201d</p> <p>All but one of the jurors, a black woman, voted to convict Pearson, resulting in a mistrial. Barnhill\u2019s office immediately moved to try the case again. In the second trial, held in another town, the jury acquitted Pearson after just 20 minutes of deliberation.</p> <p>The fact that the group was prosecuted after encouraging people to vote was stunning, said Charlene Green, an attorney who represented one of the men who pleaded guilty. Many saw the prosecutions as an attempt to intimidate minority voters.</p> <p>\u201cThese are not people who are a blight on the community. These are individuals who are actively working to galvanize marginalized people in that community,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Some noted it was alarming that Barnhill so aggressively brought prosecutions for minuscule voting infractions but didn\u2019t think charges were warranted in Arbery\u2019s case, where there was video evidence showing two men chasing down an unarmed man and shooting him.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you look at the fact pattern that has come to light in Mr Arbery\u2019s case, that this same DA looked at that video and decided that there was no probable cause to prosecute, it says to me that his judgment is informed by race discrimination,\u201d said Sara Totonchi, executive director of the Southern Center for Human Rights, which represented Pearson in her second trial.</p> <p>Barnhill said he did not have an active role in either of Pearson\u2019s trials and that if people asked him about the case, he would tell them Pearson was not guilty.</p> <p>\u201cI have a 36-year prosecution history which is open for inspection. I\u2019m proud of the work I\u2019ve done,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Barnhill has spent almost his entire career as a prosecutor in the Waycross judicial circuit, a jurisdiction situated across six counties in rural south-east Georgia. According to biographies in local news, he began tenure as an assistant district attorney in June 1983, rising to chief assistant district attorney in 1994.</p> <p>Archives indicate that Barnhill has been a mainstay on the local Republican political scene for many years. He was elected to district attorney in 2014 in a close and, at times, bitterly fought battle with a second Republican candidate, Brad Collins.</p> <p>Local news reports from the time indicate that Barnhill campaigned on a harsh, tough-on-crime agenda and touted his active support of capital punishment. According to one story in the Waycross Journal-Herald, he also once blamed \u201chigh numbers of pirates and unfriendly Indians\u201d from Georgia\u2019s colonial past for the state\u2019s \u201ccriminal element\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>Ask most makeup artists how to use white eyeliner and they\u2019ll reply \u201cin the waterline to open up your eyes\u201d. They aren\u2019t wrong, but it\u2019s a bit boring isn\u2019t it? Cynthia Rowley\u2019s SS20 models went rogue, appearing with white squiggles drawn around their eyes (the cancellation of festivals shouldn\u2019t stop your makeup from paying homage). Team with a strong brow, bronzed skin and nude lips. And remember, a liquid \u2013 not pencil \u2013 liner will help you draw a perfect cloud-like shape.

Blissfully cooling skin hydration fit for NHS heroes</h2> <p>Prior to writing this week\u2019s column I spent hours on one-to-one Zoom calls with NHS staff across the country recommending beauty products. Three things quickly became evident: their work is extremely challenging (understatement); beauty boosts their morale; and skin hydration is an issue. Hydration is right up there on our skin\u2019s hierarchy of needs. If we can get our cleansing and hydration right, we will eradicate a good proportion of our skincare issues. I generally recommend layering lots of thinner textures as opposed to one hefty, single option. As long as the formulations are clever concoctions, I\u2019ve found this works for most people (if you are extra dry or have older skin, then of course make your final step a thick cream). Choice of textures and brands comes down to personal preferences, but I reckon this emulsion, from Korea\u2019s best-selling beauty brand, will tick a few boxes. It hydrates skin deeply at every level as opposed to lazily languishing on the surface. It also includes a ceramide complex that strengthens and protects your skin barrier (helpful if you\u2019re overzealous with acids). The cooling texture is beautiful. Not as thick as your traditional face cream, not as flimsy as an essence, it sinks in gloriously, disappearing into a dewy, non-greasy finish. If there was a \u2018Best Hydrating Product\u2019 shortlist, this would make the cut. <em>AHC Aqualuronic Emulsion, \u00a322, <a href=\"https://www.lookfantastic.com/\">lookfantastic.com</a></em></p> <h2>On my radar\u2026 Soothing treats for hands, eyes and face</h2> <p><strong>Handle with care </strong>This hand cream, which smells like You, Glossier\u2019s cult fragrance, includes meadowfoam seed oil and has quite possibly the coolest (recyclable) packaging. <em>Glossier Hand Cream, \u00a316, <a href=\"https://www.glossier.com/\">glossier.com</a></em></p> <p><strong>Black magic </strong>Love the incredibly luxe, smoothing powers of Sisley\u2019s Black Rose range?
