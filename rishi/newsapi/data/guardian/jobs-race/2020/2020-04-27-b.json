One of the effects is that gradually more people become immune to the virus, which will eventually lead to herd immunity, as is the case for other viral infections. As we are dealing with a newly emerged virus, WHO correctly states that there is no certainty about the development of immunity against COVID-19, or about how long this immunity will last.

Greece is preparing to lift restrictions on movements to the islands. European stock markets have rallied. </p> <h2><strong>Boris Johnson says the UK is beginning to turn the tide </strong></h2> <p>The prime minister said the UK is turning the tide on tackling coronavirus but is still facing a moment of \u201cmaximum risk\u201d and he will not be forced to end the lockdown prematurely. Speaking outside 10 Downing Street on Monday, his first day back after recovering from coronavirus, he urged the public and business to contain their impatience to lift the restrictions. </p> <h2><strong>Iran announces 96 more deaths </strong></h2> <p>A further 96 people have died of coronavirus in Iran taking its death toll to 5,806, the ministry of heath announced. But Iran plans to go ahead with reopening of mosques in areas where the virus has not struck. </p> <h2>Russia has passed China in the number of new infections </h2> <p>Russia has confirmed 6,198 new coronavirus cases over the past day, bringing the total number in the country to 87,147 in all regions, the anti-coronavirus crisis centre reported on Monday. This is more than the 84,500 confirmed cases in China. Meanwhile, China has denied it is spreading disinformation about the virus. </p> <h2><strong>New Zealand prepares to move out of its strict lockdown measures</strong></h2> <p>The government reported only one new confirmed case of Covid-19 and said it had eliminated the virus. At 11.59pm on Monday, New Zealand will lift its level-4 lockdown which has been in place for more than four weeks. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the nation had \u201cwon the battle\u201d against widespread community transmission.</p> <h2><strong>More US states to end lockdown as economy crumbles</strong></h2> <p>Colorado, Mississippi, Minnesota, Montana and Tennessee will join other US states in the lifting of lockdown restrictions, as economists predict an unemployment rate of 16% or higher for the month of April. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said some regions of the state might qualify to open sooner \u201cwith certain precautions\u201d, such as upstate New York, as the daily death toll was markedly lower on Sunday than it was on Saturday.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T11:04:45.098Z\">at 12.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ea6ac0d8f0845d1c895e6b1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T10:00:37.404Z\">11.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Iran announces 96 more deaths</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A further 96 people have died of coronavirus in <strong>Iran,</strong> taking its death toll to 5,806 the ministry of heath announced.

At least 206,549 people have lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic, though the true toll is likely to be much higher due to under-reporting and some countries not including deaths among those with underlying conditions in their tolls.</li> <li><strong>New Zealand prepares to move out of its strict lockdown measures. </strong>The government reported only one new confirmed case of Covid-19 and said it had eliminated the virus. At 11.59pm on Monday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/new-zealand-prepares-to-lift-strict-lockdown-after-eliminating-coronavirus\">New Zealand will lift its level-4 lockdown</a> which has been in place for more than four weeks. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the nation had \u201cwon the battle\u201d against widespread community transmission.</li> <li><strong>More US states to end lockdown as economy crumbles. </strong>Colorado, Mississippi, Minnesota, Montana and Tennessee will join other US states in the lifting of lockdown restrictions, as economists predict an unemployment rate of 16% or higher for the month of April. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said some regions of the state might qualify to open sooner \u201cwith certain precautions\u201d, such as upstate New York, as the daily death toll was markedly lower on Sunday than it was on Saturday.</li> <li><strong>The UK economy will take three years to recover from coronavirus. </strong>It will take the UK economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/27/uk-economy-will-take-three-years-to-recover-from-coronavirus-ey\">three years to fully recover</a> from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a leading forecasting group. As the damage to jobs and growth unfolds, the EY Item Club said it would take until 2023 for the the economy to return to the level reached at the end of last year due to the depth of the crisis, Richard Partington reports.</li> <li><strong>British PM returns to Downing Street. </strong>Boris Johnson returned to Downing Street on Sunday night for the first time since he was admitted to hospital with Covid-19 on 6 April. The UK reported its lowest daily rise in the death toll since the end of March. The number of deaths in UK hospitals from the coronavirus has risen to 20,732 \u2013 an increase of 413 in the last 24 hours</li> <li><strong>Trump denies he will fire his health chief. </strong>US president Donald Trump, who for a second day skipped the White House press briefing, on Twitter denied reports that he planned to fire health and human services secretary Alex Azar. He said Azar was doing \u201can excellent job!\u201d. Trump also attacked the press, and was roundly mocked after tweeting about \u201cNoble\u201d prize for journalists, seeming to mean the Nobel prizes \u2013 which are not awarded in the field of journalism.</li> <li><strong>Lebanon\u2019s roads blocked in protest at dire economy. </strong>Demonstrators blocked roads through Lebanon late on Sunday to protest against the deteriorating economic situation, despite a lockdown and curfew imposed because of the coronavirus. Lebanon\u2019s worst economic crisis since the 1975-90 civil war is now compounded by the coronavirus lockdown. Forty-five per cent of the population are in poverty, according to official estimates. Its economy is forecast to contract 12% in 2020, according to the International Monetary Fund.</li> <li><strong>A million Australians downloaded a coronavirus tracking app. </strong>Health minister Greg Hunt said 1.13 million Australians downloaded the tracing app CovidSafe as of 6am (20.00 GMT) on Monday, nearly 4.5% of the country\u2019s population. </li> <li><strong>European countries announce easing of lockdown measures. </strong>Italy recorded lowest daily deaths since mid-March and prime minister Giuseppe Conte told the nation \u201cif you love Italy, maintain distance\u201d as he announced a plan that will see the country slowly ease lockdown measures from 4 May. The prime minister of France, Edouard Philippe, will on Tuesday present a national strategy for emerging from the coronavirus lockdown to the national assembly, while Spain partially relaxed its lockdown as its daily death toll dropped below 300 for the first time in weeks.</li> <li><strong>Egypt asks IMF for coronavirus bailout loan. </strong>Egypt declared on Sunday that it had asked the International Monitory Fund (IMF) for financial assistance to deal with the economic fallout caused by the coronavirus.

They have mistakenly travelled to a metro station, rather than an international bus terminal 100km (62 miles) away. \u201cOh my God,\u201d fumes Jen. \u201cWhere\u2019s the bloody bus station? We\u2019re LOST.\u201d</p> <p>Anyone who has strapped on a backpack and boarded a 6am long-haul flight will have nodded in recognition all the way through the latest series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/21/race-across-the-world\">Race Across </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/21/race-across-the-world\">the World</a> (BBC Two). As the contestants soon found out, that is the thing with travel: sometimes you accidentally discover a hidden wonder of the world, other times you are sunburnt and on the edge of a breakdown at a ticketing booth.</p> <p>Perhaps it was this sense of holiday deja vu \u2013 alongside the heartwarming displays of kindness from strangers \u2013 that made more than 4 million people watch the five couples, unaided by smartphones or air travel, race 25,000km through Latin America.</p> <p>Halfway through the series\u2019 broadcast, the Covid-19 pandemic spread rapidly, prompting most countries to lock down and suspend international travel. With each following episode, Race Across the World took on a bittersweet quality, as journeying so freely \u2013 and being within touching distance of strangers! \u2013 instantly looked as if it were from another era. While only one couple took home the \u00a320,000 prize in Sunday\u2019s episode (no spoilers ahead), the greater prize for all the contestants was being among the last people \u2013 for a while, at least \u2013 able to explore the world on a whim.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fca0960912792d1e3cab838deb71c9ad57eef501\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fca0960912792d1e3cab838deb71c9ad57eef501/0_0_4284_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam (left) and Jo in Race Across the World series two.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Travel TV is a window on the world that awaits us all\u2019 ...

Lizzie agrees: \u201cIt definitely makes it seem more epic than we ever realised before.\u201d They add that the show \u2013 and those 28-hour bus rides \u2013 unwittingly prepared them for life in isolation: \u201cWe are both quite used to waiting now \u2013 but at least we have the comfort of our phones, TV, beds and proper meals. We\u2019re still bickering every day, though \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Tim Harcourt, the show\u2019s executive producer, says: \u201cWatching the show back now, it reminds me that we all took our freedom to travel for granted. But I hope the series serves as inspiration that\u2019s especially needed during these times. Families and young people especially are tapping into these shared experiences and discovering the world the only way they can at the moment \u2013 through exciting, adrenaline-filled travel TV.\u201d</p> <p>With holidays cancelled, weddings and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/18/glastonbury-festival-postponed-due-to-coronavirus\">festivals postponed</a> and people having no idea when they will be allowed to leave their home towns, Harcourt is right in that viewers are looking to TV to transport them across continents and cultures.</p> <p>Historically, travel on TV has been a form of escapism or inspiration. In the late 60s and 70s, bright, magazine-like shows such as Holiday and Wish You Were Here\u2026? promoted the wave of cheap charter flights and package holidays in Europe. In the 00s, things shifted to reality TV competitions such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jul/14/million-miles-love-island-shipwrecked-reality-tv\">Shipwrecked</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/nov/05/how-coach-trip-picked-up-teens-and-ran-out-of-gas\">Coach Trip</a>.</p> <p>These shows are broadcast alongside celebrity travelogues from stalwarts such as Michael Palin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/10/joanna-lumleys-japan-review-an-absolutely-fabulous-travel-companion\">Joanna Lumley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/13/billy-connollys-ultimate-world-tour-review-a-reflective-reminder-of-his-brilliance\">Billy Connolly</a>, through to Jack Whitehall, Russell Howard and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/18/japan-with-sue-perkins-review-cute-candid-and-heavy-on-the-cliches\">Sue Perkins</a>. Channel 4\u2019s successful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/23/travel-man-richard-ayoade-and-his-famous-friends-are-hilarious-tour-guides-for-armchair-travellers\">Travel Man series</a> \u2013 which has been running since 2015 \u2013 announced a change in presenter from Richard Ayoade to Joe Lycett last year. But with most on-location TV grounded like the airlines, what does the future hold for our armchair travels on screen?</p> <p>Foodie jet-setters can still torment themselves by watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/03/the-trip-to-greece-review-coogan-and-brydon-have-the-midas-touch\">the final series of The Trip</a> \u2013 in which Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon eat in fancy restaurants around Europe, doing Marlon Brando impressions \u2013 which aired on Sky earlier this month, mid-quarantine.</p> <p>Josh Hyams, a producer on The Trip to Greece, is in the early stages of developing another travel series. He says: \u201cWhen I watch The Trip again, it feels like glimpsing back to an easier and less complicated time. Coronavirus has rendered making a travel show like this impossible for the moment.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that, once the virus has passed, we can rely on travel shows coming back as before. However, the problem will always be whether one can get insurance that covers a production for any outbreak or delays. That will determine when a show will be able to come back.\u201d</p> <p>The BBC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/why-a-pilgrimage-was-good-practice-for-lockdown\">Pilgrimage: The Road to Istanbul</a> also experienced a similar strange shift in world-changing events midway through transmission. But its executive producer, Caroline Matthews, believes the timing of the series\u2019 broadcast \u2013 in which seven celebrities walked the Sultan\u2019s Trail from Serbia to Turkey \u2013 and its theme of peaceful contemplation struck a chord with viewers in lockdown: \u201cI saw on Twitter that quite a few people have been commenting on the<strong> </strong>mindfulness and spirituality that\u2019s kind of been resonating with everybody at the moment because we\u2019re going through such tough times,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Matthews says they would have expected to be in the development stage for the fourth series \u2013 which films in September \u2013 but this has been put on hold. \u201cWe do have a slight advantage in that a pilgrimage is all about physical distancing and isolation by its nature.\u201d</p> <p>On the issue of the need to be mindful about bringing a cast and crew into remote areas in future, she adds: \u201cWe have a skeletal crew \u2013 the minimal amount of people to deliver the show, anyway. We\u2019re just going to have to be more creative and resourceful in how we film \u2013 splitting into smaller groups and a lot more self-shot. We always use local runners, crew and drivers, too.\u201d</p> <p>Producers will no doubt be looking to the travel industry for guidance, as it tries to work out how it can function after the pandemic. Fiona Reece, the founder of the PR and content agency <a href=\"https://www.traveltonic.co.uk/\">Travel Tonic</a>, says: \u201cThere\u2019s still a huge appetite for exploration, but I think, post-corona, people might feel nervous about travelling again. There\u2019s nothing on television that really exists to give people advice on how to book, where would be safe to travel to. I think this crisis has really highlighted the need for advice on TV shows again, like we used to see with Holiday or Wish You Were Here..?\u201d</p> <p>Reece believes the focus will be on UK-based holidays: \u201cSome people will want to go back to their favourite places, such as Devon and Cornwall, but others will want to go where they can escape the crowds. I think there\u2019s going to be much more interest in remote places, plus glamping, camping and road-tripping in camper vans to explore the British Isles.\u201d</p> <p>Matthews is also looking at filming on home turf again: \u201cWhen lockdown is lifted, we\u2019ll start work on locations. At the moment, we\u2019re looking at pilgrimages abroad and in the UK. Maybe this is where we all fall back in love with the UK again.\u201d</p> <p>As for Race Across the World, plans for the first celebrity version were postponed in March, but Harcourt remains optimistic: \u201cWe haven\u2019t started casting for the next series, but I am confident we will be ready to go as soon as travel restrictions are lifted for one of the routes we want.</p> <p>\u201cTravel TV is a window on the world that awaits us all. The effort to overcome this crisis needs to be a team like those trying to win Race Across the World \u2013 we need good communication, patience, risk aversion, foresight and planning, coupled with a bit of luck.\u201d</p> <p><em>Race Across the World: Revealed is on BBC Two</em><em> on 3 May at 8pm; </em><em>series\u2019 one and two are available </em><em>in full on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m0002tvs/race-across-the-world\">BBC iPlayer</a></em></p> <p><br></p>"
