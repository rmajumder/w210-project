  "<p>Tensions over Britain\u2019s attitude to race and heritage have heightened, with fresh attacks on statues and efforts to call off a major Black Lives Matter protest amid fears of clashes with the far right.</p> <p> BLM organisers said they had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/11/blm-organisers-call-off-london-event-to-prevent-clashes-with-far-right\">decided to cancel </a>a planned protest in London\u2019s Hyde Park on Saturday, warning that \u201cmany hate groups\u201d were threatening their safety. Other anti-racism groups are pressing ahead with demonstrations, however.</p> <p>Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people waded into the debate over statues of historical figures linked to slavery and racism that has raged since the weekend, signing petitions for and against a growing number of plans for their removal.</p> <p>In Bristol, where a statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston was toppled at the weekend, bleach or another corrosive substance is suspected to have been thrown over a memorial to the black playwright, poet and actor, Alfred Fagon. Police are investigating the apparent attack on the statue of Fagon, a member of the Windrush generation who arrived in England from Jamaica as a teenager in 1955.</p> <p>In Poole, a council announced plans to remove a statue of the founder of the Scout movement amid concerns it would be targeted by anti-racism activists \u2013 but these were thwarted when it was surrounded by dozens of local people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6f4221e339d8510b37f77b556188a235c4aff3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6f4221e339d8510b37f77b556188a235c4aff3e/0_102_4422_2652/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Baden-Powell statue in Poole.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Baden-Powell statue in Poole.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Former scouts were among those who formed a ring around the statue of Robert Baden-Powell, who died in 1941 and has been accused of racism, homophobia and support for Adolf Hitler. They vowed not to let council workers or activists get to the statue. It will now have 24-hour security protection until it can be removed.</p> <p>Baden-Powell is among those added to a growing \u201chit list\u201d of nearly 80 statues across the UK, as anti-racism action grew following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on 25 May.</p> <p>Anger at British historical figures spread abroad, with BLM graffiti daubed on a statue of Winston Churchill in Prague. The wartime prime minister espoused racist views in his lifetime.</p> <p>On Sunday BLM protesters dumped the statue of Colston in Bristol harbour. It <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/11/edward-colston-statue-retrieved-bristol-harbour-black-lives-matter\">has now been retrieved</a> and taken to an undisclosed, secure location.</p> <p>This was followed by the removal of a statue of the West Indian merchant and slaveholder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/jun/09/statue-of-18th-century-slave-owner-robert-milligan-taken-down-in-london-video\">Robert Milligan</a>. The statue of the founder of London\u2019s global trade hub had stood outside the Museum of London Docklands in West India docks.</p> <p>On Thursday night, London\u2019s Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS foundation trust said that two statues at its hospitals would be taken out of public view due to their association with the slave trade. Robert Clayton, a former lord mayor of London, had ties to the Royal African Company, which transported slaves to the Americas, while Thomas Guy, the founder of Guy\u2019s hospital, invested in the South Sea Company, which was also involved in the trade.</p> <p>The debate over the UK\u2019s historic monuments and statues has played out in online petitions, with tens of thousands calling to remove or keep them. Almost 15,000 people signed a petition to retain the statue of Baden-Powell. </p> <p>More than 10,000 people signed petitions calling for the removal of a statue of the 18th-century British colonialist Robert Clive, also know as Clive of India, in Shrewsbury. Clive has been accused of \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d and benefiting from \u201cblood money\u201d due to his role in the British imperial domination of India, Bengal and much of south-east Asia.</p> <p>Almost 5,000 people signed a rival petition to keep the sculpture. The petition, set up by Emma Dolphin, said: \u201cRemoving statues does not change history nor help us learn from it. Shrewsbury and Shropshire [have] been influenced by the actions of Robert Clive whether we condone all of his actions or not.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the statues and monuments have appeared on the website Topple the Racists, which includes 78 targets across Great Britain, from Lord Kitchener\u2019s memorial in Orkney to the statue of Francis Drake in Plymouth.</p> <p>The website, which is part of the Stop Trump coalition, aims to highlight the \u201ccomplicity and history of empire and slavery\u201d. A statement says: \u201cStatues are exercises of public adoration. And Edward Colston made his fortune in the slave trade. He was part of a system of mass murder, torture and human suffering. We must learn from, not venerate, this terrible chapter in British colonial history.\u201d</p> <p>The monument of slave owner Thomas Picton in Cardiff is the latest to be facing removal. Calls have been made to display it in a new purpose-built slavery museum.</p> <p>Aled Thomas, a descendant of Picton, <a href=\"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/thomas-picton-black-lives-matter-18396776\">wrote to the council leader, Huw Thomas</a>, saying he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by his links to the colonial governor and calling on the UK and Welsh governments to build a new national slavery museum similar to the National Holocaust Museum.</p> <p>Cardiff council said it would debate the future of controversial monuments \u201cat the earliest possible opportunity\u201d.</p> <p>In Prague a 3.5-metre statue of Churchill was sprayed with red graffiti reading \u201cByl rasista\u201d (\u201cHe was racist\u201d) and \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d.

The extremists claim they intend to prevent landmarks from being targeted but anti-racism campaigners fear that marauding gangs will seek out BLM protesters with the intention of confronting them.</p> <p>A posting from BLM London organisers announced the cancellation of the Saturday protest, saying: \u201cWe want the protests to be a safe space for people to attend. However, we don\u2019t think it will be possible with people like them present.\u201d</p> <p>It is unclear whether BLM protesters will heed the call to stay away because other protests, intended to be supportive, are still currently listed as going ahead. One \u2013 called \u201cAntifascists&nbsp;support Black Lives Matter\u201d \u2013 is due to take place on Saturday lunchtime, supported by the Labour pressure group Momentum among others.</p> <p>BLM protests are expected to go ahead in London on Friday afternoon.</p> <p>Others from the far right have urged people to head to local war memorials or statues around the country and form protective cordons.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/11/only-fifth-of-uk-universities-have-said-they-will-decolonise-curriculum\">Only a fifth of UK universities say they are 'decolonising' curriculum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs Council, said the impact of Covid-19, including an economic slump, could fuel discontent in addition to anger about police brutality.</p> <p>\u201cWe are going into the summer period which is always a challenging period in relation to to incidents and disorder \u2026 and of course now, we do have the additional factor of the extraordinary movement that\u2019s happened over the last fortnight in relation to BLM and people\u2019s feelings about inequality.

  "<p>The protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd have spread across the world and as many have said: this is not a moment, it\u2019s a movement. But it is also a moment <em>of </em>movement, as the protests have been accompanied by outbreaks of dancing. A common sight on social media and light news spots are the <a href=\"https://www.kxly.com/i/ga-protesters-dancing-to-the-electric-slide/\">Electric Slide</a> and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1269279880476164097?s=20\">Cupid Shuffle</a>, but you can also see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ben7985T-4s\">Cha-cha Slide</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NekaneHarta/status/1269207331927179265?s=20\">Macarena</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/the-george-floyd-protest-dance-that-went-viral/2020/06/04/e285c85c-a5d1-11ea-b473-04905b1af82b_story.html\">krumping</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YonceVocals/status/1267938925839933440?s=20\">haka</a> dance.</p> <p>Dance and public protest have long gone hand in hand. They have even gifted activists a marvellous, much-used slogan: \u201cIf I can\u2019t dance, it\u2019s not my revolution.\u201d Attributed to the anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman, it in fact <a href=\"https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/goldman/Features/danceswithfeminists.html\">paraphrases the original</a>. Around the personal act of dancing it spins giddy, almost ungraspable ideals: liberation, joy, self-expression.</p> <p>Euphoria is one reason why dancing goes with uprising, but it is not the only one. Look at the clips and you\u2019ll notice that nearly every dance is collective. They bring different people \u2013 black and white, protesters and bystanders, sometimes the police \u2013 into alignment. Everyone moves in sequence, with space in between. These dances are unifying actions, collective actions \u2013 not working towards a goal, but rather bringing people together in a wordless way.</p> <p>Whatever else it may be, dancing is not fighting. It is ordered without being forced, it is peaceful but not passive protest. And finally, these dances \u2013 unlike staged flash mobs or art-activist events \u2013 are unauthorised. They belong to whoever is doing them. They are, very literally, movements of the people.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jBkoEM0SSE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5jBkoEM0SSE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Right now, the people\u2019s movement of choice looks to be the Electric Slide. Why? Like the Cupid Shuffle and Cha-cha Slide, it\u2019s a four-wall line dance with a 90-degree turn between each repeat, so you can keep it going for as long as it takes. The basic sequence \u2013 sidesteps and step-touches \u2013 are simple, though the Cupid Shuffle is even simpler. Once you have the steps, you can style the rest how you like.</p> <p>The dance has a long pedigree, with black roots and widespread branches. The step sequence was first devised by Broadway dancer Ric Silver in 1976 to an upbeat reggae song by Bunny Wailer, Electric Boogie, a hit in Jamaica that went on to become a more mainstream&nbsp;US success for his compatriot Marcia Griffiths, in 1982 and 1989.&nbsp;</p> <p>Interestingly, Silver <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7492263&amp;t=1591841913082&amp;t=1591862373568\">tried very hard to authorise</a> his original 22-step sequence (his birthday being 22 January, he was very attached to the number), but despite takedown notices and copyright claims, it\u2019s an unauthorised 18-step version that took hold. You can see why the people\u2019s version won out. After a regular 16 counts, those extra 2 to swivel are like a cute little touch, sending you a notch round the phrase; add in another 4 and you\u2019ve lost the tickle. </p> <p>In the 1990s, the sequence was styled for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pF9PN8UpqI\">American line-dancing</a> and became a genre staple. It got another big boost through the 1999 black romcom&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w2Anvecs6s\">The Best Man</a>, here danced to Cameo\u2019s 1986 hit single Candy. It&nbsp;has become&nbsp;massively popular at parties and weddings,&nbsp;and is&nbsp;often called the Candy Dance.</p> <p>And that\u2019s the Electric Slide. Rooted in black culture, very widely known, accessible, adaptable, inclusive. Why not <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv2qKpna3lM\">learn it</a>? It could be fun, you can make it funky, but it won\u2019t just be frivolous. </p>",

  "<p>For many people in power,&nbsp;especially corporations, their biggest fear is not whether protesters on the street will break&nbsp;through a line&nbsp;of police. It\u2019s whether the conversation&nbsp;about racism will break&nbsp;through on issues beyond policing and draw attention to issues such as corporations\u2019 role in mass&nbsp;incarceration, the abuse Black workers face, and the racism in our healthcare system that routinely kills Black people.&nbsp;</p> <p>We must win real structural change in our&nbsp;criminal&nbsp;justice system. But not just&nbsp;because its impact is so destructive and its takeover of Black communities is so unjust. We need to win on criminal justice because it will lay the foundation for what activism looks like, and set the standards for what justice looks like, which we can then apply to fighting&nbsp;the&nbsp;corporate&nbsp;takeover of our lives.&nbsp;</p> <p>Every time I see an act of violence against Black people hit the news, or see issues of race come up in public debate, my&nbsp;first reaction is to shake my head, hold my heart and push myself to find a way to fight&nbsp;ever harder and smarter for racial justice. And then I always wonder:&nbsp;<em>after all this time, is it even possible for America to actually learn anything? Black people are doing so much teaching, but is anybody learning?</em></p> <p>The conversation on race rarely picks up where it last left off. It always seems to revert to the conversation we were having 30 years before. And it usually includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/01/22/irony-flogs-itself-steve-kings-mlk-tweet-was-worst-number-tributes-gone-wrong/\">white conservatives</a>&nbsp;quoting Dr Martin&nbsp;Luther&nbsp;King Jr back to us.&nbsp;</p> <p>As millions of people rise up to fight racism in America right now, however, I am getting a very&nbsp;different feeling. It feels&nbsp;like America <em>is</em> actually learning something about race. Not necessarily about what we need to do to end racism, or&nbsp;even the full extent of its harm. But at least the truth of Black&nbsp;experiences: the attacks on freedom and&nbsp;wellbeing that Black people face every day in this country at the hands of police and prosecutors, and also at the hands of bankers, doctors, employers and so many others. The truth of systemic racism.&nbsp;</p> <p>But that question leads to another, even more important, one:&nbsp;<em>after falling in love&nbsp;with&nbsp;the dream of change, will&nbsp;America fall for&nbsp;false solutions?&nbsp;</em>That\u2019s where corporations come in. They run the&nbsp;factories that manufacture false solutions en masse. They&nbsp;want us to take&nbsp;\u201cwe care for you\u201d for an answer. They want us to take body cameras for an answer.

It\u2019s also time to convert diversity and inclusion programs within corporations into anti-racist taskforces with the authority to make change.

It\u2019s because we built the&nbsp;infrastructure to&nbsp;influence and organize the conversation on race. We\u2019ve given&nbsp;people&nbsp;language to talk about racism and privilege. We\u2019ve given people ideas for&nbsp;thinking about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">ending policing as we know it</a>, rather than slightly&nbsp;reforming but mostly accepting the status quo of policing. We\u2019ve given people history lessons, connecting the attacks we\u2019re seeing today to the history of attacks on&nbsp;Black communities, from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/jun/02/in-1919-the-state-failed-to-protect-black-americans-a-century-later-its-still-failing\">Red Summer</a>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/01/us/tulsa-race-massacre-1921-99th-anniversary-trnd/index.html\">Tulsa Massacre</a>:&nbsp;both took place a hundred years ago and both are instances of police serving the agenda of white supremacy rather than protecting&nbsp;people against it.</p> <p>All of these groundbreaking analyses and solutions originated in Black communities.&nbsp;But much like the police themselves, these conversations&nbsp;could easily get out of control and be used against us.&nbsp;That will require calling&nbsp;out&nbsp;corporations for their injustices, and rallying as many people to fight their abuses as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://act.colorofchange.org/sign/justiceforfloyd_george_floyd_minneapolis\">millions we\u2019ve seen rally around George Floyd</a>. It will require more petitions and marches, and more donations and acts of defying complicity at work and&nbsp;among friends \u2013 from everyone, of every identity.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is the moment for racism in America that\u2019s very similar to the recent shift in the fight against climate change: many defenders of the status quo have now conceded climate change is real, but they still fight every move to actually do&nbsp;something real about it. It\u2019s an opportunity but also a challenge.&nbsp;Our biggest mistake&nbsp;would be to be so focused on fighting the&nbsp;denial we have been fighting for decades that we forget to ensure that politicians and corporate executives actually make good on the recognition they\u2019re now so readily offer. We must&nbsp;recognize the protests we see today as just the beginning.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rashad Robinson is the president of Color Of Change and a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The publishing industry is stilted and archaic. I worked in it for seven years, and left due to reasons I can\u2019t legally talk about. Though, in that time, I was able to enforce and oversee&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;steps towards sustainable change. At 4th Estate, an imprint of HarperCollins, I started the Guardian 4th Estate BAME Short Story prize (still going strong, five years later). Staggered by the lack of underrepresented voices, I knew I had to do something, <em>anything</em> to give those voices a way to permeate the industry.</p> <p>It is taken for granted that would-be writers will know what a literary agent is. But most have no idea how to structure a book proposal, or where to send it. This information is possessed by those in the know, and the people in the know often want to keep it to themselves. Let\u2019s talk about literary agents for a second; they are, effectively, tastemakers. Editors trust them to deliver books and authors that adhere to their (sometimes limited) taste. And what happens when these arbiters continue to work within the circles of writers who they already know? The same thing that always happens: books that follow trends, that look the same, that are written by the same kinds of people.</p> <p>Following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests across the world, sparked by the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/08/george-floyd-protests-black-lives-matter-donald-trump-defund-police-latest-news-updates\">George Floyd</a>, one agent at Curtis Brown tweeted: \u201cMaybe, there will now be a desire to read new voices and listen to the unheard and buy the books by those who \u2013 up to now \u2013 have been ignored by the mainstream.\u201d But who is the mainstream, if not an agency as large and commanding of the literary space as Curtis Brown?</p> <p>The curiosity to hear new voices has always been there. The desire to learn about unheard stories has&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;been there.&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jan/26/fiction.zadiesmith\">White Teeth</a></em>&nbsp;by Zadie Smith was published to critical acclaim and commercial success in 2000. My novel&nbsp;<em>Queenie</em>&nbsp;has shown how a south London girl\u2019s story can be loved in the UK and in the States (and it took until 2019 for a story like hers to reach the mainstream).&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/11/ordinary-people-diana-evans-review-couples-marital-angst-black-mixed-race\">Ordinary People</a></em>&nbsp;by Diana Evans, published in 2018 and shortlisted for the Women\u2019s prize, details exactly what the title suggests: the ordinary lives of a black and an interracial couple. We\u2019re trying to tell these stories, but it\u2019s as if the industry only allows a few of us to do so at one time.</p> <p>For all its workshops and meetings, the publishing world is only just starting to put the work in to printing stories by black writers, and there are still so few on the shelves. So who has really been ignoring these writers, and these stories, up until now? Who should the onus be on here? Is it not the tastemakers? I won\u2019t ever say that these things are too little, too late. There\u2019s time to make long-standing change, but it has to come from the right place. And that place is understanding the role that the industry has been playing, up until now, in ignoring and suppressing black voices. </p>",

But that doesn\u2019t go, of course, to the purpose of this bill.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:49:43.314Z\">at 7.49am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee1d18d8f0860ca20faa257\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/daniel-hurst\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:40:43.235Z\">7.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I was in the Senate gallery a short time ago when the chamber divided over <strong>Pauline Hanson\u2019s </strong>attempt to suspend standing orders to allow consideration of her motion that \u201call lives matter\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Hanson\u2019s attempt failed, as she garnered support from only her One Nation colleague <strong>Malcolm Roberts</strong>. Most others \u2013 including the Coalition, Labor and the Greens \u2013 united against the attempt to suspend standing orders.</p> \n  <p>But it\u2019s worth noting that the conservative Liberal party senator <strong>Jim Molan</strong> stepped out of the chamber immediately before the division on Hanson\u2019s motion and returned straight after the result was read out, 51 votes to 2. It looked very much like he abstained rather than voting with his government colleagues \u2013 but we\u2019re chasing a comment from his office.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:44:53.525Z\">at 7.44am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee1d0f68f0875833522a116\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:38:47.710Z\">7.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Patricia Karvelas:</strong> Just finally, there\u2019s something significant that\u2019s happened in the Senate. <strong>Pauline Hanson</strong> was trying to get her motion up, the all lives matter motion. The government, the Greens, Labor, minor parties ensured that never did go to a vote. Why did you all work together on that?</p> \n  <p><strong>Concetta Fierravanti-Wells:</strong></p> \n  <p>I have to say I\u2019m on leave at the moment, so I haven\u2019t been in the chamber. So I\u2019m not fully across what\u2019s happened this afternoon in relation to that. <strong>In relation to this, can I just say all lives matter.</strong> And therefore as far as I\u2019m concerned, I have to say that the activities that we\u2019ve seen, particularly of some of the protesters at a time when we are in these very difficult circumstances, I think has demonstrated a degree of irresponsibility.</p> \n  <p><strong>Karvelas:</strong> That\u2019s the language of senator Hanson\u2019s motion that all lives matter. The reason the movement is called Black Lives Matter is black people around the world and in the US are disproportionately represented in these kinds of cases, with the police and the justice system. That\u2019s why the movement exists because there is a different treatment.</p> \n  <p><strong>Fierravanti-Wells</strong></p> \n  <p>Patricia, can I just say I respect the right of people to express their point of view and to protest. The point being at this point in time, given what we are going through, it wasn\u2019t the appropriate thing to do. I appreciate events in the US. Can I also say in relation to the events in the US, I think we do need to distinguish what\u2019s happening in the US and what\u2019s happening in other parts of the world. I do respect this issue but at this particular point in time I would have liked to have seen a lot more responsibility on the part of Australians and I know this is an issue that a lot of Australians are very upset about. There are people who weren\u2019t able to go to weddings and mourn their families.</p> \n  <p><strong>Karvelas: </strong>I\u2019m talking about the substantive issue: black lives matter. That\u2019s because black people are not treated the same in the justice system. Do you agree with that?</p> \n  <p><strong>Fierravanti-Wells</strong></p> \n  <p>Patricia, I think as myself being a lawyer; I think the justice system has served us well in Australia. As I have said, I think in the end what is really important is that all Australians have the opportunity to be their best. And that includes most especially having a job and so therefore the focus of our government has been on ensuring jobs, jobs, jobs. That means jobs for all Australians.</p> \n  <p><strong>Karvelas: </strong>You say the justice system as the served our nation well. Do you think it has served Indigenous Australians well?</p> \n  <p><strong>Fierravanti-Wells</strong></p> \n  <p>I think it has served Australia well. There are concerns and there have been concerns in relation to deaths in custody. But I think in the end when you do look at the reasons why young people go off the rails or things happen, it\u2019s because ultimately there has been a breakdown issue in their family circumstances or their economic circumstances. And as somebody who worked with Father <strong>Chris Riley</strong>, there are many things that contribute to young people or people going off the rails. So ultimately, stability and a very important component of that is work. So it is vitally important for us to have a strong economy and part of that strong economy is to ensure that as many people are in jobs as is possible.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:47:13.860Z\">at 7.47am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee1d06b8f08beee219d96ce\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:35:52.620Z\">7.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Concetta Fierravanti-Wells </strong>then says \u201cAll lives matter\u201d when asked about Pauline Hanson\u2019s motion.</p> \n  <p>SIGGGGGHHHHH.</p> \n  <p>If I have to explain to anyone, again, why all lives matter is an offensive and completely tone-deaf response to Black Lives matter, please send an email to doyourresearchandthentakealookinthemirror@gmail.com</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:37:18.315Z\">at 7.37am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee1cfee8f08beee219d96c9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T06:34:10.802Z\">7.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Liberal senator <strong>Concetta Fierravanti-Wells </strong>who crossed the floor to support a crossbench motion for a Senate inquiry into Australia\u2019s relationship with China, tells the ABC she doesn\u2019t believe it is smart for Australia to have so much trade with one country:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The point is it is not a good business model to put a third of your trade eggs in one basket.

Now the name of this program is the SME rxport hubs and that\u2019s probably an indication of how it operates because it is a hub which means that it services an entire region. </p> \n  <p>\u201cSo the assertion that the member is making clearly just demonstrates a very limited understanding of the program. So the SME export hubs don\u2019t just help those businesses located just next door to them; they actually assist a number of businesses across wide regions. </p> \n  <p>\u201cNow a clear example that I\u2019d like to actually put to the House, and this might also assist the member with his understanding, is that in South Australia we have Food South Australia. They received a grant to establish a hub in round one. They are explicitly offering to assist all businesses across South Australia. Now, let\u2019s be clear, it is based in a location but it provides support right across South Australia. So I would also like to take the opportunity to point out, Mr Speaker, that this is a competitive grant program. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAll applicants provided evidence of how they met the criteria through a two-stage application process.

Cancer-suffering grandfather <strong>Raymond Murphy</strong> had to sell his house and move to his shed to afford medical treatment. He said debt collectors ripped him to shreds over a $2,300 robodebt while he was in hospital. Why won\u2019t the government apologise to Mr Murphy and thousands of other Australians ... with their unlawful robodebt scheme?</p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>I\u2019ll ask the minister for government services to add to the answer. The business of raising and recovering debts on behalf of taxpayers is a difficult job and it deals with Australians in many very sensitive circumstances. </p> \n  <p>Of course I would deeply regret \u2013deeply regret \u2013 any hardship that has been caused to people in the conduct of that activity. The government has many difficult jobs that it has to do dealing with Australians in very sensitive circumstances and that is true particularly at this time. </p> \n  <p>It is our instruction that we would hope that all agents of the government when pursuing the debt recovery option that they would be sensitive to people\u2019s circumstances. </p> \n  <p>And in relation to the particular gentleman that you referred to, that is a very distressing situation that you have raised. <strong>I would apologise for any hurt or harm in the way that the government has dealt with that issue and to anyone else who has found themselves in those situations.</strong> </p> \n  <p>But the issue is one of ensuring how the government can best do this.

I will ask the minister for government services to add to the answer.</p> \n  <p><strong>Stuart Robert:</strong></p> \n  <p>I would say to the member, if any member can refer any hardship cases through to me and I will ensure the department looks at it. Mental health and suicide, as we all know, and we all appreciate, are very delicate issues. There are many factors that go into them. Services Australia assess people facing difficult situations every day. We have the largest social services network to support people within federal government departments in times of crisis and vulnerability and we do this everyday. </p> \n  <p>As the prime minister said, the collection of debts is a lawful responsibility of all governments. Right now, just so that colleagues are aware in the House, 939,000 Australians have debts over $5bn that the government lawfully has to collect across a whole range of programs. </p> \n  <p>And governments of all persuasions have done this across the divide. The government has paused all debt collection across all programs as we work our way through the Covid crisis but government will have to restart that debt collection and will do it sensibly and do it engaging all people, do it in a very transparent manner. </p> \n  <p>It is incumbent on us all if we have constituents who are hurting or suffering, bring them through to me.

Prime minister, if you don\u2019t want Black Lives Matters protests to continue, why don\u2019t you do something about institutionalised racism in this country? Will you agree with the Greens proposal to put action on black deaths in custody on the national meeting this Friday and make it a future item for the future national cabinet meetings and come up with a law so we stop locking up Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at such high rates. </p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>I thank the member for the question on what is an extremely important issue and that is Indigenous deaths, whether it be in police custody or it be in custody more generally. </p> \n  <p>As the minister for Indigenous Australians pointed out yesterday this is already a matter of significant attention of not just the government but state and territory governments as well. </p> \n  <p>It previously did feature with more specific goals more broadly under justice headings in this area that related to the previous Closing the Gap objectives but as also featuring in the new reform set of Closing the Gap goals which is now coming to agreement for the first time involving the direct involvement of Indigenous peak groups in agreeing what those goals should be. </p> \n  <p>It is also the case that in NSW, for example, we are pleased that there has been progress that has been made in police custody. In NSW there has been one death in police custody, I\u2019m advised, since 2000 and in particular since 2000 when the new arrangements were put in place to provide for access for Indigenous persons who would find themselves in police custody to make those calls and get access to that legal advice.</p> \n  <p> Now the government is now funding that program over the next three years and that has proven to be a very effective mechanism to prevent deaths in police custody. </p> \n  <p>Every death in custody, and particular Indigenous deaths in custody, is an absolute national shame and tragedy and what the minister for Indigenous Australians has been working to do is also to address the contributing factors which find Indigenous Australians in custody. </p> \n  <p>You asked about the agenda of the national cabinet. When I announced the formation of the national cabinet going forward, I also announced the establishment of the national federation reform council. There are only two national taskforces that report to that council; importantly one deals with these very issues in Indigenous affairs, the other one deals with violence against women. </p> \n  <p>We all agreed, premiers, myself, chief ministers, that they were the issues that needed constant national priority and attention by the national federation reform council which brings all the key decision-makers together and for progress to be tracked against the successes that we hope to achieve in that area. So our government is very committed to action in this area. </p> \n  <p><strong>It is an important issue but when it comes to the issue of gatherings and protests, the health advice says it put other Australians\u2019 lives at risk including, in particular, Indigenous lives. </strong></p> \n  <p><strong>And I, I\u2019m sure the leader of the opposition would agree with me: \u201cDo not go to those rallies.

He seems to be unaware of the broad range of measures that the government has been putting in place, globally recognised, that are providing the necessary economic supports. We have listened carefully right across the economy. </p> \n  <p>Those working, those running businesses, and particularly to those running businesses, that\u2019s why the treasurer announced the extension of the instant asset write-off, a very important measure. </p> \n  <p>It is why the measures that kick in in July that involves further support and stimulus payments in the economy in July will be occurring. It is why one of the first things we did was to ensure that jobseeker would be at a sufficient level ...</p> \n  <p>What the government will continue to do is make decisions about the level of supports we provide into the economy based on the best possible advice and the best reading of the economic situation as that becomes increasingly clear.

Why won\u2019t the prime minister give a straight answer to this simple question: will more Australian workers be kicked off jobkeeper early or not?</p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>The only people talking out of both sides of their mouth when it comes to the issues of the Covid response is the Labor party. They oppose the very measures that they support. Each way on every issue has been the response of the Labor party.</p> \n  <p>Feigning, Mr Speaker, so much support for the government\u2019s response but taking every single opportunity to niggle and undermine for their own political purposes. </p> \n  <p>This is disappointing.<br></p> \n  <p>That that is the approach that the Labor party has sought to take during this crisis.</p> \n  <p>I am pleased that there are better examples.<br></p> \n  <p>There are better examples and that has been exhibited by my colleagues who sit around the national cabinet table, the Labor states who sit around that table. I have made it abundantly that jobkeeper is in place for the legislated period we have put in it place, which is until the end of September. That is what we are doing, Mr Speaker. We have been saying that consistently but those opposite have sought to sow confusion and to undermine these positions and the interjection comes about childcare.</p> \n  <p>The interjection comes about childcare. I explained the matter very clearly yesterday. We put in place a better support for workers. Over $700m in direct subsidy support to the childcare sector to support those jobs on top of the rebates, which extend to 95% rebate for childcare fees for persons who are on the jobseeker payment. </p> \n  <p>So Australians know that they are getting the leadership from this government when it comes to the economic policies and lifeline that they need to move through this crisis and as we\u2019ve seen from the OECD that has been recognised.

But, you know, the way that was done and the suggestion that they might do it again, sort of, I think, risks public support for even the issue they raise.

But by doing this, they have put the whole track back to recovery at risk and certainly any further action on this front would be absolutely unacceptable on any terms because we want to see all this stuff come back in and the funerals for me personally, I mean, we both have lost a parent recently and we were both in a position to have our fathers well remembered and that was incredibly important to us. And it breaks my heart about every funeral story that I hear and I want to see that come back like so many other things. But people going out and going to mass rallies puts that at risk.

This is off the back of Black Lives Matter. In London, the mayor is saying that every monument is now up for review and one of the statues in the UK with a question mark now is of Captain <strong>James Cook</strong>. How do you feel about the removal of these statues? </p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: </strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, when you\u2019re talking about Captain James Cook, in his time he was one of the most enlightened persons on these issues you could imagine. </p> \n   <p>I mean, Australia when it was founded as a settlement, as New South Wales, was on the basis that there\u2019d be no slavery. And while slave ships continued to travel around the world, when Australia was established yes, sure, it was a pretty brutal settlement. </p> \n   <p>My forefathers and foremothers were on the first and second fleets. It was a pretty brutal place, <strong>but there was no slavery in Australia</strong>. </p> \n   <p>And so I think what we\u2019re seeing with some of these protests, they start on a fair point when they\u2019re raising issues about, you know, people\u2019s treatment in custody or things like that. </p> \n   <p>Fair, fair issue. </p> \n   <p><strong>But now it\u2019s being taken over by other much more politically driven leftwing agendas, which are seeking to take advantage of these opportunities to push their political causes.</strong> And, you know, we\u2019ve got to ... <strong>I\u2019ve always said we\u2019ve got to be honest about our history. </strong>We\u2019ve got to acknowledge the positive and the negative. </p> \n   <p>But, you know, <strong>I think we\u2019ve also got to respect our history as well.

Again, jobkeeper will be there \u2013</p> \n  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Based on your last answer, where you won\u2019t rule out more people being removed from jobkeeper, what are they counting on?</p> \n  <p><strong>Cormann:</strong> <strong>I won\u2019t rule out adjustments at the end of a review. I can\u2019t pre-empt or hypothesise \u2013</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Q:</strong> So people can\u2019t count on it, because at the end of the review there may be adjustments and those adjustments might be people.</p> \n  <p>And this was the prime minister on Sydney radio 2GB just a few minutes ago:</p> \n  <p>Q: Jobkeeper is due to expire in September but there\u2019s a chance it might end earlier for some industries like it will for childcare on July 20. Do we need to be upfront, PM, now, about the fact that some other industries will not have jobkeeper until September as first indicated?</p> \n  <p><strong>Scott Morrison:</strong> <strong>Well, I don\u2019t know why people are suggesting that.</strong> Childcare was a fairly special case because we had moved to that free childcare arrangement. What has been done is that the normal fee arrangements have come back but when working with the childcare sector, when there was a choice between going with ongoing jobkeeper or a 25% subsistence payment to the sector \u2013 so we\u2019re talking about the same amount of support which means more employees will be helped in our consultations \u2013 that was seen as the better way forward. So I think this is a very special case. Jobkeeper is there until the end of September. </p> \n  <p><strong>Q:</strong> What about industries other than childcare? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: </strong>Well, there are no other sort of special arrangements like we had in childcare so we\u2019ve dealt with that one quite specifically.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Will jobkeeper remain until the end of September for everyone else?</p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong> Well, I\u2019ve already said that. So I don\u2019t know what that other speculation is about. <strong>That just sounds like Labor making mischief.</strong><br></p> \n  <p><strong>Q: </strong>I thought it was because you guys said it was under review.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong> <strong>That\u2019s about how you\u2019re implementing the program, that\u2019s a lot of administrative issues and things like that. I mean, the reason we put jobkeeper in place for six months was to provide that confidence and certainty and that\u2019s what it\u2019s done.</strong><br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-10T23:21:33.326Z\">at 12.21am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee1608b8f08beee219d93be\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-10T22:40:32.487Z\">11.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It is Collingwood v Richmond in the AFL tonight as Australia\u2019s best football league resumes its season.</p> \n  <p>(Go Pies!) </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-10T23:20:14.334Z\">at 12.20am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee15c978f08758335229e1f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-10T22:21:45.625Z\">11.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The number of deaths in custody has risen since Saturday.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/murpharoo/status/1270837221369638912\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Listening to the PM on 2GB.

  "<p>Growing up, we didn\u2019t feel as if the police were there to protect us.&nbsp;We were always fearful of the police; we couldn\u2019t walk around in large groups because that would attract them, and we were often subject to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/sep/21/sus-law-black-youths-london\">\u201csus\u201d (\u201csuspected person\u201d) law</a>. </p> <p>When I joined the force in 1983, it came as a total surprise to my parents. I knew people from my background would see me as a sellout for joining the organisation that made us feel unsafe. A lot of my friends were very hostile towards me, whether they\u2019d had experience with the police or not.</p> <p>At the time, many police officers were very militaristic. The first few months at Hendon training school were a real culture shock and I felt as if I was questioning my sanity. I found it really difficult to comprehend that the police were meant to be a public service. I started street duties as a constable in Islington, in north London, where I had grown up, and I got more of a sense of comfort with the community than working with my colleagues. It was an us-and-them mentality and I found the police to be quite insensitive to the community, especially the black community.</p> <p>Initially, they didn\u2019t really want me, as a black police officer, to express my individuality. You had to be part of the team, you had to assimilate, not integrate. They didn\u2019t want me to use my cultural understanding of the community; they wanted me to put that to one side.</p> <p>When the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/institutional-racism-britain-stephen-lawrence-inquiry-20-years\">Stephen Lawrence inquiry</a> was published in 1999, it was a watershed moment that led to a cultural change and a lot more informed thinking within the police. There was a reduction in casual racism and explicit comments. I remember once going for a job on the crime squad when I was a PC and someone told me my face \u201cdidn\u2019t fit\u201d, for example. If you complained, they would say: \u201cIf you can\u2019t take a joke you shouldn\u2019t join.\u201d Sometimes I feel like we have gone back to that era.</p> <p>When I first saw the video of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/09/george-floyd-buried-black-lives-matter-trump-coronavirus-live\">George Floyd</a> being killed, I was disgusted, especially because it was a police officer who did it. It looked<strong> </strong>like sadistic torture, so slow and deliberate. It is one of the most brutal acts I\u2019ve seen from a police officer. Derek Chauvin let down all the current officers around the world and even the retired ones like me. I felt devastated; it actually made me cry.&nbsp;</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t surprised that Floyd\u2019s death created such an outrage and a sense of social injustice around the world. People want to ensure that their voices are heard \u2013 and it is a diverse group of people too. It reminds me of when I was a youngster, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2017/aug/12/flares-and-fury-the-battle-of-lewisham-1977\">in the 1970s, when the National Front was </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2017/aug/12/flares-and-fury-the-battle-of-lewisham-1977\">big</a>. On marches, people would sing: \u201cBlack and white unite and fight the National Front.\u201d It brought black and white people together to protest and it\u2019s the same thing now.</p> <p>Most of the people in Bristol who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/the-guardian-view-on-colstons-statue-a-long-time-in-going\">dragged down the Edward Colston statue</a> were white. They want to get rid of those images, sites, buildings and statues that show the inhumanity of the past and the inequalities it has caused. I don\u2019t want to condone creating damage or committing crimes but you have got to understand what\u2019s behind it: people are putting social justice before social distancing.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the UK, we have a different style of containment to that of the US. When I attended the march on Wednesday 3 June, the police stepped back. When we started the march&nbsp;from Hyde Park&nbsp;to Parliament Square, and then up to Trafalgar Square, there didn\u2019t seem to be any officers controlling the junctions or walking alongside \u2013 they held back and left people to their own devices. By Saturday, gathering together to march had been deemed unlawful, but people still turned up. It created more of a siege mentality between the protesting public and the police.</p> <p>In 2017, we had a case in Hackney, where I used to work as a sergeant, that also resonated with me. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/24/rashan-charles-decision-prosecute-police-officer-death-black-man\">young man called Rashan Charles</a>&nbsp;was chased into a shop because an officer felt he was involved with drug supply. He died after the officer restrained him on the floor. The jury ruled his death to be accidental, caused by an obstruction to his airway \u201cby a foreign body during a period of restraint\u201d [a half-swallowed packet of caffeine and paracetamol]. Charles\u2019s great-uncle, also a former police chief inspector, branded the inquest \u201ca farce\u201d.&nbsp;Not all such cases spark an uprising the way <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jun/10/mark-duggan-shooting-can-forensic-tech-cast-doubt-on-official-report\">the shooting of Mark Duggan did in 2011</a>, but we are far from out of the woods.</p> <p>I used to tell officers: \u201cEvery single time you encounter someone and you don\u2019t treat them with respect and dignity, that is another person who resents us. That\u2019s another person who might not work with us to solve a crime, that\u2019s another person who might not want to go to court.\u201d I set up a youth leadership program called <a href=\"https://voyageyouth.com/\">Voyage Youth</a> almost 20 years ago. Every single year, the youngsters taking part would say they felt overpoliced and underprotected. The current protests could be another watershed moment in Britain \u2013 I hope Boris Johnson is paying attention.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was updated on 12 June 2020 to explain the foreign body that blocked Rashan Charles\u2019s airway.</p>",
  "<p>In 1998, Christopher Alder, a former British army paratrooper, was injured during a fight and ended up in hospital. He was then arrested for a breach of the peace and<a href=\"https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/christopher-alder-george-floyd-death-4195831\"> taken to Queens Gardens police station in Hull</a>. CCTV footage shows him lying face down on the floor of the station, motionless, with his trousers around his ankles. Officers stand around laughing while he lies there, dying, for 10 minutes.</p> <p>Three years later, an inquest returned a verdict of unlawful killing \u2013 because the officers did nothing while, for three minutes of that time, Alder was unable to breathe. A year later, five police officers were prosecuted for manslaughter and misconduct in public office. All were acquitted on the direction of the judge. A review by the Independent Police Complaints Commission in 2006 concluded that four of the officers present were guilty of the \u201cmost serious neglect\u201d and \u201cunwitting racism\u201d. To add insult to injury, in 2011, Alder\u2019s family learned that they had buried a woman instead of Christopher.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is a shocking case of a death in police custody \u2013 but of course it is not the only one. In the past weeks, as protesters have taken to the streets, some of the names of those who have died have been on demonstrators\u2019 lips and placards.<strong> </strong>Among them is Sean Rigg, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/01/sean-rigg-five-officers-cleared-of-misconduct-over-death-in-custody\">died at Brixton police station in 2008</a>. An inquest found police had used \u201cunsuitable force\u201d. One officer was prosecuted, for giving false evidence; he was found not guilty. No other officer was prosecuted.</p> <p>In 2011, Kingsley Burrell died while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/15/kingsley-burrell-restrained-by-police-died-from-neglect-inquest-finds\">detained by police at a mental health unit in Birmingham</a>. An inquest found that prolonged restraint had been a significant factor. Again, three officers prosecuted for lying under oath were found not guilty. In 2017, Darren Cumberbatch was punched repeatedly, beaten&nbsp;with a baton and Tasered&nbsp;by police.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-48764711\">An inquest found police force was \u201cexcessive\u201d and \u201cprobably avoidable\u201d</a>. His family&nbsp;are still waiting to&nbsp;hear&nbsp;if anybody will be prosecuted. Just over two weeks ago, Simeon Francis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/england-police-watchdog-investigates-death-of-man-in-custody\">was found dead in a cell in Devon</a>. We know little about the circumstances, and I fear that his family won\u2019t be getting answers any time soon.</p> <p>Since 1969, just one police officer has been convicted for their role in the death of someone in their care (and in that case, the officer received a suspended sentence). That is not to say there haven\u2019t been prosecutions \u2013 but the evidence has never been sufficient to persuade a jury that a police officer should be responsible.&nbsp;</p> <p>Why is this?&nbsp;Well, invariably, in such cases the only witnesses are other police officers; there may also be CCTV and some medical or forensic evidence. In the civilian world, friends will give evidence against friends in the most serious of crimes, but after three decades working in criminal law, I cannot recall a death-in-custody case where a police officer has given evidence against another police officer. Juries are loth to convict police officers generally, but the tendency is especially stark in these cases. One successful prosecution of an individual in 50 years tells its own story.</p> <p>Of course, deaths in custody are only a small percentage of deaths following police contact, which include apparent suicides and police shootings, among other categories. Well-known examples include Rashan Charles, who died after being chased and restrained; Edson Da Costa, who died of cardiorespiratory arrest after being stopped by police; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jun/10/mark-duggan-shooting-can-forensic-tech-cast-doubt-on-official-report\">Mark Duggan, whose shooting sparked riots in 2011</a>. Nor will I soon forget how Zahid Mubarek was murdered by his racist cellmate Robert Stewart at Feltham Young Offenders Institution. They were housed together despite the fact that Stewart\u2019s hostility to BAME people was widely known.</p> <p>It is true that many other people die in police custody, but <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/52890363\">black people account for 8% of these deaths</a>, while accounting for only 3% of the population. They are dying disproportionately and the perception remains that race leads to a different outcome, which is often premature death.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Partly this is because this is merely the end point of a system that disproportionately suspects, arrests, charges, remands, convicts and imprisons people from black, Asian and other ethnic minority communities. A David Cameron-commissioned report by David Lammy found in 2017 that the colour of your skin has a measurable impact on how you are treated at every stage in the justice system.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"749fdf6be1d51fd9c6d947f30ff3d63fa033591c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/749fdf6be1d51fd9c6d947f30ff3d63fa033591c/0_0_1942_2425/801.jpg\" alt=\"Zahid Mubarek, who was victim of a brutal racially aggrevated murder in March 2000 while detained at Feltham Young Offenders Institution for shoplifting.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zahid Mubarek, who was victim of a brutal racially aggrevated murder in March 2000 while detained at Feltham Young Offenders Institution for shoplifting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley/Teri Pengilley (commissioned)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, for instance, at a time when <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/576554/youth-justice-review-government-response-print.pdf\">the stated determination of the government</a> has been to divert young offenders from the formal criminal justice approach, the proportion of young BAME prisoners has gone up, from 25% in 2006 to 41%. The numbers offending and reoffending also rose. Historically, stop-and-search powers have disproportionately targeted BAME people. In 2015, in response to widespread alarm, the Home Office and police tightened training and guidance of police officers, which instantly reduced the numbers being arrested. However, following a spate of knife crime, the rules were again changed and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/oct/18/more-bame-people-likely-to-be-targeted-under-relaxed-stop-and-search-rules\">the numbers have </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/oct/18/more-bame-people-likely-to-be-targeted-under-relaxed-stop-and-search-rules\">moved back</a> up to historic highs.</p> <p>Between April 2018 and March 2019, there were four stop and searches for every 1,000 white people, and 38 for every for 1,000 black people. Lammy\u2019s analysis of sentencing data showed BAME defendants were more likely to receive prison sentences for drug offences, even when previous convictions were taken into account. This was reinforced by research commissioned by <a href=\"https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/publications/item/investigating-the-association-between-an-offenders-sex-and-ethnicity-and-the-sentence-imposed-at-the-crown-court-for-drug-offences/\">the Sentencing Council published in January</a>, which showed that if you are from a minority you are 1.5 times more likely to go to prison for drugs offences than if you are white.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lammy\u2019s report proved in effect that if you placed a white man and a BAME man in the same predicament with the same previous history, with the same or similar evidence, the BAME man was more likely to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/08/david-lammy-review-bame-children-face-prejudice-flawed-criminal-justice-system\">stopped, arrested, charged, denied bail, convicted and sentenced to prison</a>. Then, while in prison, he was less likely to be supported to rehabilitate, more likely to reoffend and more likely to die in custody \u2013 and his family were less likely to get justice following that death.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lammy recommended urgent reform. However, three years later, there is not one BAME chief constable \u2013 in fact there has only ever been one. Until very recently, there were no BAME commissioners dealing with miscarriages of justice and not one member of the 240-strong parole board was BAME. There has never been a BAME director of public prosecutions and the number of BAME judges and magistrates, while it is increasing from a very low base, is still well below the proportion that will reflect the communities they serve. When I was chief crown prosecutor and then chief executive of the country\u2019s police and crime commissioners, I would often sit in meetings of criminal justice leaders and be the only non-white person in the room apart from the person taking the minutes.</p> <p>I was born in Britain, to a family that has&nbsp;worked with the British army for half a century, one of whom was murdered by the IRA for doing so. I have spent much of my professional career tackling crimes and misbehaviours in all communities regardless of race or religion, yet I too have been subject to racism in the course of my work.</p> <p>One of the last things I did as a prosecutor was to ensure that the district judge Richard Hollingworth could no longer preside over criminal cases. This came about because of his response when one of my team was trying to fix a trial date to accommodate the victim, Miss Patel. \u201cIt won\u2019t be a problem,\u201d said Hollingworth. \u201cShe won\u2019t be working anywhere important where she can\u2019t get the time off. She\u2019ll only be working in a shop or off-licence.\u201d Where she was working was irrelevant. As it happens, she was a law graduate, but his prejudice was there for all to see.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>When I was less senior, I recall asking another judge to bail the defendant because he had no previous convictions. I was wrong, the judge said. I replied that there was nothing on the police national computer. But he was adamant. It was a busy \u201cfirst appearance\u201d list so I hadn\u2019t seen the defendant come up from the cells behind me. I looked and saw he was a young black man. I knew what the judge was saying and I gave him a stare that told him I knew and he should back off. He did.&nbsp;</p> <p>I recall prosecuting a case where I, the defence counsel, the judge, the usher, the court legal adviser, the defence solicitor, the court stenographer and the security were all BAME and the defendant was white. How we all laughed! How we all thought this would never happen again. How right we were.</p> <p>The same systemic racism applies to victims from BAME communities. There is not enough research, but we do know that if you are a white victim of domestic abuse you will suffer, on average, 35 incidents before action is taken by an authority. The equivalent number of incidents for BAME victims is 100. The latter have less confidence in reporting, higher familial and community obstacles to overcome, and fewer properly funded support groups to advise them. And when it\u2019s more difficult for people to ask for help, it\u2019s easier for the system to ignore them.</p> <p>All of this means I am not surprised to see people marching in the streets during lockdown.&nbsp;The trust deficit between those in power and those they lead is greater than at any time in living history. The lies we are told have been amplified and adopted as a strategy by people who should know better.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 June 2020 to make clear that one police officer has been convicted since 1969 over a death in custody (the case of Craig Boyd where in 2007 a duty constable got a suspended sentence for misconduct after Boyd hanged himself in a Derby police cell in 2004). Text and a heading had spoken of no convictions. For the record: two prosecutions for breach of health and safety succeeded against police forces, not individuals: Devon &amp; Cornwall in 2019 over the 2012 death of Thomas Orchard, and the Metropolitan police in 2007 over the 2005 shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>If I hear one more white person say \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d I think my head will explode. The slogan, powerful when first popularised by black people after the shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012 in the US, has now become so ubiquitous as to have lost almost all meaning.&nbsp;A way for people to endlessly repeat \u201cI hate racism\u201d while doing nothing to actually stop it.&nbsp;</p> <p>White people, I assume you don\u2019t like the idea of other people being treated as inferior just because of the colour of their skin. But that\u2019s such a basic sentiment that you shouldn\u2019t be giving yourself a buzz from saying it.<br></p> <p>When even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/i-hear-you-boris-johnson-to-black-lives-matter-protesters\">Boris Johnson can say \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d</a>&nbsp;\u2013 the same Boris Johnson who talks of African piccaninnies, of \u201cbank robber\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/02/boris-johnsons-burqa-comments-led-to-surge-in-anti-muslim-attacks\">burqa wearers</a>, who leads a party riven by Islamophobia but refuses a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/17/equalities-professor-to-head-tory-inquiry-into-discrimination-in-party\">proper investigation</a> into it, and who was part of a government that deported black British citizens, and continues the injustice of the hostile environment to this day \u2013 well, you know the slogan\u2019s cultural appropriation is complete.&nbsp;</p> <p>Even racists hate racism. That\u2019s why they\u2019re always looking for ways to excuse what they do. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault \u2013 black people are just a bit more criminal than white people.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not being racist \u2013 it\u2019s just that a lot of Muslims are terrorists.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love to recruit a black person \u2013 it\u2019s just that they\u2019re not quite the right fit for this role.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that \u2026\u201d You won\u2019t find this chanted in a city square by thousands of protesters, but these are probably the three most powerful words in the history of institutional racism. They\u2019re the words people say in private \u2013 or don\u2019t say \u2013 when they\u2019re making the decisions that really matter. They are the words that determine whether someone gets that job, or that business contract, or that university place, or that rented room.&nbsp;<br></p> <p>Over the past few days I\u2019ve wondered, why&nbsp;now? Why,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>after all we\u2019ve known about police brutality against black people,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>are people only now saying, en masse, that enough is enough? I think there are two core reasons. First, given the lockdown, there\u2019s not a lot else for young people to do.&nbsp;The anger is genuine, but the usual distractions<strong> </strong>that stop people from turning out have gone.&nbsp;It\u2019s the first time in months that young people have been able to be part of a group activity.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the other factor is more fundamental: and that is, white guilt. While black people have raged about the shootings and asphyxiations,&nbsp;for most white people there\u2019s always been a get-out.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that [those words again] \u2026 he was maybe being too aggressive \u2026 maybe the officers thought they were under threat \u2026 it was a spur-of-the-moment pull of the trigger.\u201d It\u2019s allowed white people to believe that, though the outcomes were all horrific, a white suspect in the same situation could have suffered the same fate. The George Floyd video crashed through that delusion. A subdued and incapacitated suspect; a knee pushed down on his neck as he pleaded for breath; passersby screaming for his life as it ebbed away; officer Derek Chauvin blithely ignoring it all, cocksure that he\u2019d face no consequences for his actions; a fellow officer standing guard to prevent anyone coming to Floyd\u2019s rescue. For almost nine minutes, many of them after he had passed out. Nine minutes.</p> <p>No white person&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>could believe this could happen to them. That an officer of the law could be so callous, so unconcerned about the life of a white man.<br></p> <p>That\u2019s why, this time, there have been unprecedented numbers of white people<strong>&nbsp;</strong>declaring their allegiance to the antiracism cause. On the streets, even in the US, most protesters have been white.&nbsp;<br></p> <p>Though &nbsp;many of these new activists will have only a superficial understanding of race issues, it has to be a positive thing that at last they\u2019re starting to notice.&nbsp;This was nowhere more apparent than in Bristol this weekend. If it had been a black-only crowd,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>would the statue of notorious slavemaster Edward Colston really have been allowed to topple, let alone be dragged through the streets and dumped in the River Avon?<br></p> <p>Many British people were upset at what they saw. And I have some sympathy: mob rule is generally a bad thing, and risks getting disastrously out of hand. But&nbsp;what a glorious moment. It\u2019s an image that will last years in the memory, as the moment that people in one English city said the ritual humiliation of black lives was no longer acceptable. You can say \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d a million times but it will change nothing. This action changed things.&nbsp;</p> <p><br>When I saw&nbsp;Floyd\u2019s life drain slowly away, I wondered why so little had changed since the&nbsp;Black Lives Matter&nbsp;movement swept across the US in 2014.&nbsp;Surely all US police officers should know they will be held accountable for any transgressions, especially when caught on camera? Chauvin clearly feared no repercussions.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are 18,000 separate police forces in the US. In the UK there are 43. If we\u2019re going to bring about change we need to find a way to get into them all, change them all, and make those changes stick. It won\u2019t be by simply calling for more black police officers. That\u2019s been tried before, and any change is glacially slow. It won\u2019t be just by rooting out \u201cbad apples\u201d: a system that allows them&nbsp;in unchecked&nbsp;in the first place is already rotten to the core. It won\u2019t simply be by giving all officers \u201cdiversity training\u201d: a couple of weeks on the streets after completing such a course, and they\u2019re back in the old routine, acting on the instincts and stereotypes.&nbsp;</p> <p>On the day&nbsp;of&nbsp;the first major UK Black Lives Matter protest last Wednesday,&nbsp;the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick,&nbsp;was giving evidence to the London assembly.&nbsp;She&nbsp;was talking, coincidentally, about the disproportionate number of fines handed out to black people during the coronavirus lockdown \u2013 double the rate for white people.</p> <p>This, she explained, was partly because more officers have been operating in high-crime areas. To which the response must be, what has the lockdown got to do with high-crime areas? It\u2019s just another way in which black people (more likely to live in poorer areas, which are more likely to have higher crime rates) continue to be disproportionately targeted by the police.&nbsp;And then Dick added, as if trying to defend this: \u201cWe\u2019ve said again and again, be sensitive, be careful. And I think [our officers] have been. But I have to be honest, I haven\u2019t gone back to them to say, think about your unconscious bias.\u201d<br><br>So there it is: we have officers disproportionately targeting black people, and nothing said to them in advance about being aware of the danger of racial stereotyping.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is where leadership really counts: the day-to-day decisions, at the most senior levels,&nbsp;that affect&nbsp;thousands of lives. To make lasting change, we ultimately have to get off the streets and into the rooms where these decision-makers operate.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@BarackObama/how-to-make-this-moment-the-turning-point-for-real-change-9fa209806067\">Barack Obama&nbsp;has&nbsp;set out an intelligent long-term plan</a> \u2013 \u201cHow to make this moment the turning point for real change\u201d \u2013 which involves working locally with US mayors, district attorneys and local police chiefs.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the UK we have to be equally thoughtful \u2013 so that every single officer, every single business chief, every head of every institution thinks every single day about the need to eradicate racism and bias. Black Lives Matter is a catchy slogan. But right now, action is what really matters.</p> <p>\u2022 Joseph Harker is the deputy Opinion editor</p>",

  "<p>The Chinese government directive urging its citizens not to travel to Australia threatens to render a still under construction $2.2bn casino complex on Sydney harbour a \u201cwhite elephant\u201d, according to industry experts who say the project can no longer rely on income from high-roller gamblers from China who were central to its business model.</p> <p>Gambling academics and city planners have all expressed concern over the future of Crown\u2019s Sydney casino at Barangaroo as a result of the <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-06-06/do-not-travel-to-australia-china-warns-citizens-of-racism/12328488\">Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism\u2019s warning to Chinese residents</a> \u201cto enhance their safety awareness and do not travel to Australia\u201d issued last week, citing a spike in racism during the coronavirus pandemic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Senior gaming industry advisers told the Guardian the Chinese government had previously been successful in directing where Chinese citizens gamble, noting Macau, and while most Australian casinos will suffer from last week\u2019s travel warning, it appears to impact Crown\u2019s planned Sydney casino most directly.</p> <p>Crown \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/24/crown-inquiry-told-australia-less-stringent-controls\">whose ownership and allegations of high-roller junkets and money laundering are the subject of a NSW parliamentary inquiry</a> and other planned inquiries \u2013 has attracted controversy over plans to target VIP players at the 75-floor tower that will also include 82 luxury apartments and a six-star hotel, due to open in December, ahead of the casino\u2019s opening in early 2021.</p> <p>However, the future revenue stream of the skyline-dominating building, which was controversially approved for the city\u2019s second casino license in 2013 without going to tender, has been thrown into question after a drop in high rollers in recent years, related to a series of events that include <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-13/crown-employees-detained-in-china-charged/8612688\">Crown employees being arrested in China in 2016 for promoting gambling,</a> and efforts from Beijing to limit gambling spend outside of the country.&nbsp;</p> <p>This has prompted industry observers to question the viability of the Crown Sydney project relying solely on foreign high rollers, and while Crown has not applied for poker machines \u2013 considered a reliable income source for casinos \u2013 its future rival Star City recently secured a <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/star-casino-deal-blocks-pokies-at-crown-sydney-until-2041-20200601-p54ycm.html\">21-year exclusivity deal with the New South Wales government</a> to be the only Sydney casino with poker machines.</p> <p>While the group\u2019s strategy throughout Covid-19 closures saw it stand down about 95% of its 11,500-strong workforce while securing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/16/crown-and-star-casinos-outline-survival-strategies-for-coronavirus-shutdowns\">funding to continue construction of the Barangaroo site</a> during the pandemic, revelations surfaced <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/crown-woos-punters-in-sydney-rsls-as-barangaroo-opening-nears-20200520-p54usc.html\">that Crown had organised invite-only events for VIP players at Fairfield and Rooty Hill RSL clubs earlier this year,</a> which the company\u2019s chief executive, Ken Barton, responded to by saying Crown Sydney \u201chas always, at its heart, been a destination designed for both Sydneysiders and visitors alike\u201d.</p> <p>Charles Livingstone, an associate professor of public health and head of the gambling and social determinants unit at Monash University, told the Guardian that while the Chinese travel warning would also affect middle-class tourists who stay in and gamble at Australian casinos, the drop off in high rollers presented a bigger threat to casinos.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are they going to get the gamblers from now? That\u2019s a very good question because ... their finances rely on a high number of high rollers from China. I\u2019d say they are in very difficult circumstances,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Livingstone, a longtime critic of Crown, warned the Barangaroo casino may look to target local gamblers and negotiate with the state government for a poker machine licence, citing the casino\u2019s contribution to the economy.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, Livingstone, who has researched the social implications of gambling, argues \u201cgambling in general is probably a net loss for any government\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cMany casinos in Australia have opened on the promise they won\u2019t have pokies and usually within five years they end up with pokies,\u201d he said.</p> <p>There is no evidence to suggest Crown has made any attempts to secure poker machines for its Sydney casino and it has ruled out doing so in the past.&nbsp;</p> <p>Crown has previously noted it has \u201ca comprehensive anti-money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing program\u201d in place which is subject to Austrac supervision, and defended its dealings with Chinese junket operators as being registered with their local authorities.</p> <p>Mike Harris, an academic in urban architecture at the University of New South Wales who has researched the Barangaroo project, said the casino will \u201cbecome a white elephant\u201d if they are forced to rely on the high-roller customer base from China given Beijing\u2019s travel warning.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIf that high-end Chinese market wasn\u2019t available maybe the Barangaroo casino wouldn\u2019t have gone ahead in the first place,\u201d Harris said.&nbsp;</p> <p>He told the Guardian the approval process for the casino and \u201ca lack of transparency around planning amendments\u201d had damaged \u201cfaith in the NSW planning system\u201d.</p> <p>Harris predicts Crown will negotiate for a poker machine licence, or will try to boost the number of luxury apartments \u2013 which start at $9.5m \u2013 as a way to restructure Barangaroo\u2019s profitability.</p> <p>\u201cIf they are forced to remain a high-end roller casino, and we\u2019re not getting these whales (high rollers), it will become a white elephant,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Victor Dominello, the NSW minister responsible for liquor and gaming, told the Guardian \u201cwe are encouraged by Crown Sydney\u2019s plans to open early next year. The facility is expected to directly employ over 2,000 staff once fully operational\u201d.</p> <p>The Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore, a longtime critic of the Barangaroo casino, told the Guardian \u201cgifting public foreshore land to a casino giant remains an outrageous betrayal of the community\u2019s trust, and an abuse of power that places private profit ahead of the public interest\u201d.</p> <p>The Guardian contacted Crown for comment.</p>"
