  "<p>A man joins the Black Lives Matter demonstration in Melbourne and holds a placard \u201cAll lives matter\u201d. It\u2019s snatched from him and the police take him away while he is stating what many of those who have engaged in similar counter-sloganeering have stated before him: \u201cThere is nothing racist about this.\u201d</p> <p>While some veteran white supremacists, hypocritically, are familiar with the kind of blurring of reality that their counter-slogan is creating, other people I know still don\u2019t understand how offensive the proclamation \u201call lives matter\u201d is. So in the belief that some who genuinely misunderstand what is happening can be made to understand, and because it is useful to what I want to argue, let me explain what to many of us is obvious.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/11/nsw-supreme-court-blocks-refugee-rally-accusing-protesters-of-russian-roulette\">Sydney protests: police warn they will prosecute those who attend BLM and refugee rallies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Black Lives Matter is not an answer to an abstract question such as \u201cwhich lives matter?\u201d In today\u2019s context Black Lives Matter is directed at a racist culture which cheapens the lives of black people. It clearly means \u201cblack lives should also matter\u201d. It is an invitation to make visible the specific devalorisation of black lives in our society. That is why responding to Black Lives Matter with \u201call lives matter\u201d is racist. It tries to make this specific devalorisation invisible.&nbsp;</p> <p>Racists, as a rule, strive to make you visible when you want to be invisible, and to make you invisible when you wish to be visible. If you\u2019re trying to be one of the crowd, the racists will pull you out of that crowd, throw your difference at you and scream: \u201cHow dare you act as if you\u2019re one of the crowd? You are different!\u201d But if you say, \u201cI am being targeted because of my difference,\u201d the same racists will scream at you: \u201cHow dare you act as if you are different? You\u2019re just one of the crowd.\u201d The slogan \u201call lives matter\u201d works precisely in this way: \u201cLet\u2019s make your horrendous experience disappear by talking about \u2018all of us\u2019 rather than about you specifically.\u201d</p> <p>But if for some of us, anti-racist writers and activists, critiquing \u201call lives matter\u201d is relatively easy, what about the various acts of anti-racist solidarity that we and others engage in and that also end up decentring the black experience? </p> <p>For instance, while there are plenty of occasions where one can use anti-black racism to reflect on \u201cracism in general\u201d, and while there are also many occasions where one can equate racialised experiences and say, \u201cWe Palestinians, or we Holocaust survivors, know what it is like \u2026 ,\u201d there are times where such generalisation and equalisation achieve the same effacement of the specificity of anti-black racism as \u201call lives matter\u201d.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Racists strive to make you visible when you want to be invisible, and to make you invisible when you wish to be visible</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Do logics of generalisation and equalisation such as the above dilute specificity? The answer is not an easy yes or no, in the abstract. The question should invite us to reflect on when it can be a yes and when it can be a no. And there is no doubt that today, amid the Black Lives Matter demonstrations that are happening around the world, to engage in generalisations about \u201cracism\u201d, or in equalising forms of solidarity, is to participate in effacing the specificity and acuteness of anti-black racism.&nbsp;</p> <p>Anti-black racism is historically one of the most lethal racism there is. No one has to inherit the combined traumatic history of colonialism, slavery and racial exclusion the way black people do. The mere weight of this history has a racialising and chattering effect on those who carry it that is hard for any of us, including other racialised people, to comprehend. At the same time, everywhere around the world, black racism is perpetuated by being articulated to police brutality in a way that no other racism is. </p> <p>Police brutality inserts itself into the consciousness of a black person in the way the threat of rape inserts itself in the consciousness of women. For many, indeed for most, it is an ever-present danger. A change of a radical nature is required to bring this to an end.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/this-is-black-liberation-in-australia-the-time-is-here-to-be-on-the-right-side-of-history\">This is black liberation in Australia - the time is here to be on the right side of history | Lynda-June Coe for IndigenousX</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I receive an email from my university telling me that given what is happening in the US \u201cnow is the time to think about racism\u201d, and I think: that is not good enough. In my university, we\u2019ve had to deal with the rise of anti-Indian racism, and we\u2019ve had to deal with the rise of anti-Muslim racism. Recently with Covid-19 we had to deal with the rise of anti-Asian racism. All are, of course, important and I am certain that it is good for the university to reflect on how it can think these racisms together to infuse a permanent anti- and non-racist culture on its campuses. </p> <p>But today, in the face of the traumatic events that black people have had to endure, what is communicated to us by protesters is clear: \u201cNow is the time to think about black people, to think about anti-black racism, and to do something concrete about combating it, particularly in relation to the foundational role of police brutality in perpetuating it.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s what I want my university to reflect on and do something about. Speak to its black students and staff, confront the question of police brutality towards black people inside and outside campuses, and do something concrete to support black students. The same goes for every institution anywhere. The killing of black people, followed by riots and outrage, followed by a return to the same order of things, is a familiar pattern.</p> <p>Protesters around the world are inviting us to make the<strong> </strong>slow and horrendous death of George Floyd the start of something different. And it should be easy to tell who is serious about starting the hard work of instituting something different and who will lazily return us back to more of the same.</p> <p>\u2022 Ghassan Hage is a professor of anthropology and social theory at the University of Melbourne</p>",

The family and I are seeking answers as to what happened to Simeon.\u201d</p> <p>Desmond Jaddoo, a community activist who is assisting the family, said: \u201cClearly, without making any allegations at this point, Devon and Cornwall police must be held to account as to what happened to Mr Francis while he was in their custody and their duty of care towards him.\u201d</p> <p>The IOPC is focusing on the care Francis was given during detention and the frequency and adequacy of the checks carried out on him.</p> <p>Francis was arrested at 12.45am on 20 May on Cowley Bridge Road in Exeter, the IOPC said on Monday. He was taken by police van to Torquay police station more than 20 miles away, where he was booked into custody at about 3am. He was later found unresponsive in his cell and an ambulance was called, but he was pronounced dead at 6pm the same day.</p> <p>Devon and Cornwall police said no members of staff had been suspended or restricted in connection with the death.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p><br><br></p> <p><br><br></p>",
  "<p>The callous killing of George Floyd resonated powerfully across all of Britain\u2019s black communities, given our long-running issues with the police. But his death at the hands of four Minnesota police officers probably had more meaning in one part of the country than any other.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Tottenham, north London, five black people have died at the hands of the police. There is my friend\u2019s mother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/aug/08/anger-tottenham-broadwater-riots-1985\">Cynthia Jarrett</a>, who died of a heart attack during a police raid on her home in 1985. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/celldeaths/article/0,2763,195387,00.html\">Joy Gardner&nbsp;</a>(1993) died after the police gagged her, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/oct/03/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation\">Roger Sylvester</a> (1999) died after being restrained. Then there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/05/mark-duggan-shooting-report-challenged-by-human-rights-groups\">Mark Duggan</a> (2011) and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-51476107\">Jermaine Baker</a> (2015), who were both shot and killed by Metropolitan police officers.&nbsp; It has been determined through investigations in all these cases that the police officers had no case to answer for.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Tottenham we certainly received no such statements of empathy following any of those five deaths in our community</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As with Floyd, the deaths of Jarrett and Duggan led to demonstrations and rioting, in the latter case sweeping <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london-riots\">across the whole country</a>. It is ironic, then, that chief constables from across the country should have chosen to publish a <a href=\"http://news.met.police.uk/news/uk-police-stand-with-those-appalled-by-george-floyd-death-403767\">statement of support</a> for last week\u2019s Black Lives Matter demonstrations:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cWe stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and horrified by the way George Floyd lost his life. Justice and accountability should follow. In the UK we have a long established tradition of policing by consent, working in communities to prevent crime and solve problems. Officers are trained to use force proportionately, lawfully and only when absolutely necessary.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s just possible that some younger people within Black Lives Matter movement are under the illusion that policing in the US is more overtly racist than in the UK. But in truth this crass PR statement, published on the Metropolitan Police\u2019s website, is an insult to all the families who have lost loved ones at the hands of British police, whether they be black or white.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Tottenham we certainly received no such statements of empathy following any of those five deaths in our community. In fact, in every instance, we had the exact opposite response. The Met appeared to follow the same line of using the media to tarnish the characters of the victims, sometimes before relatives had even been informed of their deaths. It was this callous treatment of Duggan\u2019s family that led to the demonstration at Tottenham police station two days after his killing, which in turn sparked the riots.</p> <p>However, this week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jun/10/mark-duggan-shooting-can-forensic-tech-cast-doubt-on-official-report\">Guardian report</a> into his death \u2013 using a groundbreaking 3D reconstruction from a human-rights research agency, Forensic Architecture \u2013 is a sign of how things might change. Finally, families can have hope that loved ones killed by the police may receive justice.&nbsp;</p> <p>Initial media reports on Duggan\u2019s death claimed there had been a shootout after he had fired at the police. It later transpired that they had been given this <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-25776826\">misinformation</a> in a briefing from the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). But the most contentious issue surrounding the case has always been that the gun \u2013 which Duggan had been seen to collect in a shoebox earlier that day \u2013 was eventually \u201cdiscovered\u201d almost eight minutes after he was shot, some seven metres away from where he had been shot.</p> <p>Somehow the inquest jury was able to return a verdict of \u201clawful killing\u201d even though not one witness, including the 11 police officers who took part in the stop, testified during the entire three-month hearing that they had seen Duggan throw a gun. The IPCC eventually published its report claiming that the \u201cmost plausible explanation\u201d was that Duggan had <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-32041119\">thrown the weapon</a> after he had received the first shot.&nbsp;</p> <p>Describing the verdict as \u201cperverse\u201d \u2013 on the basis that there was no witness who saw a gun thrown, and that the shooting of an unarmed person by agents of the state should never be deemed to be \u201clawful\u201d \u2013 the family began legal proceedings. Although the Met had previously stated its intention to fight the civil action, they ultimately agreed last year to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/10/mark-duggan-shooting-family-settle-high-court-claim-against-met\">out-of-court settlement</a> with Duggan\u2019s family. The Met has made no admission of liability for the death.</p> <p>Many believe the settlement came because Duggan\u2019s legal team commissioned Forensic Architecture to examine the killing. The research group used the testimony provided by police officers during the inquest, along with Home Office pathologist reports, to create an interactive 3D digital model. This, for the first time, provided an independent visual reconstruction of the last moments of Duggan\u2019s life.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jun/10/mark-duggan-shooting-can-forensic-tech-cast-doubt-on-official-report\">Mark Duggan shooting: can forensic tech cast doubt on official report?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Forensic Architecture\u2019s model challenges the version of events given by the police at the inquest, and brings into question the IPCC\u2019s findings. It comes to the conclusion that the IPCC was incorrect to conclude that the gun could not have been planted in its position. The family is now calling for the IPCC\u2019s successor body, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), to reopen its investigations. The IOPC has said it is reviewing Forensic Architecture\u2019s report and will reopen the investigation \u201cif there are compelling reasons to do so\u201d.</p> <p>The sophisticated reconstruction is a striking challenge to the state\u2019s monopoly over the investigations of deaths at the hands of the police. Duggan\u2019s family now has some measure of&nbsp;justice; but in future it might also help to make not only the police but also the bodies that are meant to scrutinise their work, far more accountable for their actions.</p> <p>The police may object to this new level of scrutiny, but ultimately, for all of us, surely we\u2019d far rather have justice than unrest on our streets.</p> <p>\u2022 Stafford Scott was a co-founder of the Broadwater Farm Defence Campaign in 1985, and is now a consultant on racial equality and community engagement.

That in turn triggered white mobs to attack black businesses, homes and individuals.</p> \n<p>Over two days of violence, according to a later Red Cross estimate, 1,256 houses were burned, and two newspaper offices, a school, a library, a hospital, churches, hotels, stores and black-owned businesses were among the buildings destroyed or damaged by fire.</p> \n<p>Although the official tally at the time claimed just 36 people had been killed, historians believe the number to be considerably higher.

Although choosing 19 June was not meant to be incendiary, some blowback was expected, the officials said.

  "<p>Australia\u2019s prime minister took his time before weighing in on the country\u2019s Black Lives Matter movement.

And that\u2019s what I would like the media to also focus on: it\u2019s not \u2018do you or don\u2019t you\u2019. It\u2019s actually thinking about deeply what the issues are.\u201d</p> <p>Morrison appeared somewhat chastened as he was taken to task about his claims that there was no slavery in Australia. \u201cI acknowledge there have been all sorts of hideous practices that have taken place.

And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to go into an endless history wars discussion about this.\u201d</p> <p>Protesters have indicated they intend to hold more rallies at the weekend. Many argue that while they acknowledge the health risks from the pandemic, racism poses its own risks to Australia\u2019s First Nations people. A popular placard at last weekend\u2019s rallies read \u201cRacism is a pandemic\u201d.</p> <p>Bond said it was a painful moment. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing that black lives matter, but what black people are being reminded of is how little they\u2019ve mattered,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are hurting because it\u2019s taking them back to the first time they noticed that race was real and was violence.

But the Prime Minister is refusing to rule out kicking workers in other industries off JobSeeker before September. Why can\u2019t the Prime Minister be clear - which Australians will he leave behind? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong><br></p> \n  <p>From the very outset of this crisis, the Government has put in place the most comprehensive, the largest set of income support and economic lifeline measures that this country has ever seen. And the one we started with was JobSeeker, because JobSeeker, the unemployment benefit is the safety net that sits right under all Australians if they find themselves out of work. That\u2019s what we did first. <br></p> \n  <p>The second measure, substantial measure that we put in place for income support was JobKeeper. Now, JobKeeper was put in to ensure that Australians could find themselves continuing to be on the books of employers and doing some work in some cases, and they would be there in that arrangement for six months. <br></p> \n  <p>That has bought our economy critical time. If businesses were put in a position that they had to make decisions back in March and April about whether those employees could stay in those businesses, we would have seen millions more find themselves on their way seeking support through the unemployment system. <br></p> \n  <p>Now, Mr Speaker, that decision bought those businesses time. It bought Australia time. When other countries were only going for three months, we took the decision to go for six months. <br></p> \n  <p>And that provided some certainty and confidence, and since that time, we have seen consumer confidence restored under the ANZ Index, and 70% restore by business since the COVID crisis hit. Now we are going through the same thoughtful, meticulous process of considering the data and looking forward and reviewing the program to make the right set of decisions about the right combination of income supports and fiscal supports to the economy that would be in place after the end of September. <br></p> \n  <p>This is how our Government makes decisions. We do things carefully, considering the advice, looking at the economic environment and ensure that we make those decisions at the right time. <br></p> \n  <p>JobKeeper is there until the end of September, Mr Speaker. That\u2019s why we put it in place. It will remain in place until the end of September. <br></p> \n  <p>And Mr Speaker, it will continue to provide that confidence. At the same time, the Treasurer and I and the members of the Cabinet will work together with the members of the Government to ensure that we get the right balance and mix of fiscal policies, because it\u2019s the fiscal policies, given the absence of monetary ammunition that\u2019s in the system that will be so important. But we want, above all things, above all things, is to get Australians back into jobs. <strong>Australians don\u2019t want to be on JobKeeper or JobSeeker. They want to be in jobs, Mr Speaker.</strong> <br></p> \n  <p>And what we hear from the Opposition all the time is how they would seek to keep people back, not allow them to go forward. And the policies we will put in place and continue to put in place will be about them - not only getting the support they need when they need it. But in the jobs they need. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee30baf8f08cdef7bed3f35\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T05:00:26.604Z\">6.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jim Chalmers </strong>to <strong>Scott Morrison:</strong></p> \n  <p>Will the prime minister look at extending the jobkeeper wage subsidy beyond September as suggested by the Reserve Bank governor? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong> gets the nod:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Thank you. I thank the member for Rankin for the question. I too, enjoyed that profile piece in the Weekend Australian on the leadership credentials, but maybe not as much as the leader of the opposition. Now, the reality is \u2013 as the honourable member knows \u2013 the Reserve Bank governor said that it is actually too early to tell what the state of the economy will be in a number of months. <br></p> \n   <p>But what he did say is that the economic support that the government has been providing has been very, very substantial Mr Speaker, and making a real difference in helping to keep people connected to their employer, and staying in a job. Now, we\u2019ve announced that we will be doing a review. <br></p> \n   <p>A review over the course of this month and the outcomes of that review into the jobkeeper program, and the assembly of the data will inform decisions that the government will take about the future of that program. <br></p> \n   <p>And any announcements around the future of that program will be made on 23 July when the finance minister and I provide an economic and fiscal update. But Mr Speaker, the jobkeeper program has been saving lives and protecting livelihoods. <br></p> \n   <p>It is helping millions of employees and hundreds of thousands of businesses right across the country. <br></p> \n   <p>But, Mr Speaker, what I do know is that at a time of need, because the economy was in a position of economic strength, because we had balanced the budget, because we had provided substantial tax cuts and got people off welfare into work, we were in a position to support the Australian economy with some $260bn, or over 13% of GDP, which is massive macroeconomic support in the words of the OECD and has seen Australia perform remarkably well on not just the health front, but on the economic front as well.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T05:05:33.597Z\">at 6.05am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee308668f08969537f7840b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T04:51:55.556Z\">5.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>asks <strong>Scott Morrison </strong>about the VC for Tasmanian <strong>Teddy Sheean, </strong>again, and Morrison is NOT impressed:</p> \n  <p><strong>Albanese:</strong> the prime minister has received a recommendation from the defence honours and awards appeals tribunal that Tasmania\u2019s <strong>Teddy Sheean</strong> be awarded a Victoria Cross for \u201cthe most conspicuous act of valour in the presence of an enemy\u201d. Why does the prime minister need another review to tell him that Teddy\u2019s sacrifice should be honoured with a Victoria Cross? </p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: t</strong>here is absolutely no doubt that Teddy Sheean was an extraordinary Australian who did extraordinary things. At a time that none of us in this place can possibly imagine. And the issues that were confronted by servicemen and women at that time is nothing we can imagine. Their commanders and those who were there at that time and made judgment on these issues. So when one goes back and looks at these matters again, one must be very careful when they\u2019re putting themselves in the place of others who were there at the time.</p> \n  <p> Now, Mr Speaker, the tribunal, the four members of the tribunal, not all 11, but the four members of it, was unanimous. Not 11, just four. I point that out to the leader of the opposition. As he represented that all 11 members of the tribunal made that decision. That is in fact not the case. There was four, Mr Speaker. </p> \n  <p>But Mr Speaker, equally, then the government receives the recommendation from the tribunal, the government then needs to consider that recommendation informing a view, and indeed, the minister and then the prime minister needs to form a view. And so you take advice from all of the agencies that would have a relevant view on this, as I have done. <br></p> \n  <p>And I tabled, Mr Speaker, the letter from the chief of the defence force, Gen Campbell, for the purposes of the question and for the House. I can assure you, as prime minister and as chair of the national security committee of cabinet, that I do not consider the advice of the chief of the defence Force lightly. I consider it very carefully. And it wasn\u2019t just the current chief of defence force, Mr Speaker. Not just the current chief of the defence force that I have consulted on this matter. But many others, many others, Mr Speaker, who have served in that capacity in recent times. <br></p> \n  <p>So I\u2019m not going to consider the advice that comes from the single person who commands every single man, woman who serves in our defence forces lightly. So the issue that is raised in relation to this matter, Mr Speaker, is whether compelling new evidence has been presented and is available for me to take a decision that would enable me to make a recommendation to Her Majesty. <br></p> \n  <p>Now Mr Speaker, that matter, on my advice, is in dispute, and so I have sought advice from the former defence minister, the former solicitor general, the former secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet, and one of the most renowned military historians in this country, to consider that very precise question.

The shadow minister wants to bring out quotes. I\u2019ve got a lot of quotes for the shadow minister.

It will mean more new homes, more small businesses and jobs are protected and provide a stronger bridge to the economic recovery of our country.\u2019 And it goes on and on and on. In fact, I\u2019ll continue. I\u2019ll continue if we\u2019ve got quotes. <br></p> \n   <p>We\u2019ve got a home builder, Jessie Zilkie from Bundaberg ,who said the following in response. On the first Saturday after the homebuilder was announced, the response that they had for the house and land packages, she said the following. <br></p> \n   <p>\u2018We\u2019re gearing up. I\u2019ve employed three people this week in various roles. I\u2019ve been in contact with some subcontractors, suppliers, to make sure that we can handle it. It\u2019s certainly going to be a boost locally to jobs and the industry.\u2019 It goes on and on. In the Domain article that the shadow minister referred to, in that Domain article, it referred to the fact that house and land packages throughout this country increased last Saturday by up to 70%. <br></p> \n   <p>Now what do new home sales mean? It means what I said earlier this week. The hundreds of thousands of jobs in the residential construction industry are protected. Now I know the shadow minister probably hasn\u2019t come across a tradie. He\u2019s been here a bit too long in the halls of Canberra. <br></p> \n   <p>But hundreds of thousands of tradies, carpenters on building sites, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers and in regional Australia \u2013 the timber mill workers who make the frames and trusses. <br></p> \n   <p>The manufacturers who make the bricks and the glass and the tiles. Those hundreds of thousands of jobs will be protected. We estimate 20,000 new homes. 7,000 substantial rebuilds, and those 20,000 new homes we\u2019ve also seen evidence is overwhelmingly supporting new home-buyer, so the Labor party have opposed the first home super saver scheme.

The scheme provides for 27,000 new projects, which is 7,000 renovation/new builds. And 20,000 new home constructions. It was never the intention of this program to provide subsidy support for small-scale renovations.</p> \n   <p> That was not the purpose. And I\u2019ll tell you why we weren\u2019t going to do that. We weren\u2019t going to do that because the risk of integrity to the program and a repeat of the insulation batts farce that occurred under the Labor party, where people were going around knocking on doors, basically pulling in pink batts and saying that they\u2019re going to put them in your roof and pocketing the difference was a joke. <br></p> \n   <p>It was a complete failure, Mr Speaker. Four people died, Mr Speaker, in relation to that program. They died as a result of that program as established in a royal commission. I note, I note Mr Speaker, in a royal commission. <br></p> \n   <p> So in this program, we were not going to give rise to a situation where people passing themselves off as renovators were going to go and knock on the doors of pensioners, rip out their sinks and dishwashers and then seek to claim some government subsidy. That\u2019s not the nature of the program. <br></p> \n   <p>This is not for do-it-yourself home renovations. This is about approved work by certified builders of significant scale to enable people to bring forward projects that they have put off and now can proceed with. <br></p> \n   <p>Now I note the derision that is applied by those opposite to someone who might be proceeding with a substantial renovation, a new build of their home, of some $150,000. The average loan taken out for a renovation is $164,000.</p> \n   <p> And I can tell you that\u2019s the case, because there are families around this country who cannot afford to go and build a new home. Their families are expanding. Their children are growing up. They can\u2019t afford to sell their house and go and buy land and engage in a new construction. So what do they do? They borrow money to expand their existing home and renovate substantially their existing home, because they can\u2019t afford to build a $300,000 or $350,000 new home. <br></p> \n   <p><strong>The opposition\u2019s derision of this initiative smacks of two things.

How will the prime minister ensure that bushfire victims like these ones can access the homebuilder scheme? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: </strong>Well, thank you, Mr Speaker. And I thank the member for her question, and I commend her for the work that she\u2019s done within her community, as I do all of those members who have been in bushfire-affected areas for the work that they\u2019ve done in engaging communities and raising issues that need to be addressed. </p> \n  <p>The commitment that we made to the states and territories was to jointly fund the demolition work that was being done across all of those buildings that were damaged and destroyed during the course of the bushfires. <br></p> \n  <p>The advice I have from the state government in NSW is that demolition work will be completed next month, but is already progressing through so many parts of the state. <br></p> \n  <p>That is the project which is managed, by the state government. They\u2019re running the contractors and they\u2019re doing it at a cracking pace and I commend them for doing that, and to keep pushing forward. The homebuilder program, as introduced by the housing minister and by the treasurer enables grants of $25,000 for those who are eligible under the income test rules to be able to support the construction of new homes. <br></p> \n  <p>And one of the key issues I\u2019ve been discussing with the state and territory premiers has been how we can escalate and more rapidly ensure that approvals are given, not just for these types of cases but more generally. The purpose is to bring it there and get the projects happening again. <br></p> \n  <p>But people in affected areas are eligible for the grants, subject of course to the income restrictions placed on those, and I\u2019ll be working closely with the states and territories to ensure that they can accelerate the rate of a home approval, not just in these areas but everywhere, because this is critical to job creation. It\u2019s absolutely urgent for those who are impacted by the bushfires. Certainly, definitely, but it is also critically important for those for whom their jobs depend on getting the jobs started. <br></p> \n  <p>There is no greater focus this government had than on job creation in the wake of the Covid circumstances and indeed in the wake of the bushfire crisis.

Are those requirements being observed for special purpose flights in and did you have to warn<strong> Alan Tudge </strong>and others that they weren\u2019t correctly social distancing on the most recent flight from Melbourne to Canberra?</p> \n  <p><strong>Murphy:</strong> social distancing is not possible in the same way in domestic flights. We have a domestic airline policy. Airlines, domestic airlines, certainly short-haul airlines, present quite a low risk of transmission because of their air handling. We have not seen a clear case of transmission of the virus on a domestic flight in Australia. So whilst initially the airlines were practising good distancing, they are now occupying their seats more fully, and I know that\u2019s one of the circumstances where we think it\u2019s not an unreasonable choice if someone chooses to wear a mask.</p> \n  <p> I certainly have not warned any politician about not practising social distancing. So airlines, and on the return flights from overseas, they have been at 80% occupancy, so we\u2019re trying to get a bit of gap. But you can\u2019t get the full 1.5-metre on a flight. But as you say, there are special requirement force flights, and they are not a very high risk environment. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Scott Morrison:</strong> I\u2019m going to have to call it off there,<strong> but I do note that I think on every press conference, except in this room, that I\u2019ve had to warn the media that weren\u2019t practising social distancing. </strong>Thank you very much. <br></p> \n  <p>Ahhh, no glass jaws here.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T03:32:01.100Z\">at 4.32am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2f4638f0839df65384659\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T03:23:20.470Z\">4.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On whether \u201cblackbirding\u201d would be considered slavery (it was) and what needs to be done with Indigenous policies, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well on the first point, I acknowledge there have been all sorts of hideous practices that have taken place.

Its health policy, its youth policy, its suicide policy, its employment policy, its welfare policy; this is an incredibly complicated area and not all Indigenous experiences are the same. Indigenous Australians living in metropolitan areas have different life experiences to those living in regional and remote areas and so to suggest that there is one set of issues that applies to the Indigenous population is obviously ridiculous.</p> \n   <p>And we are aware of the heartbreaking stories within remote Indigenous communities, of abuse, sexual violence, of alcoholism, of drug abuse.

Many posties will continue delivering letters on bikes, and others will be retrained to deliver parcels in vans, putting them where the work is, securing their job with Australia Post, and better meeting the increasing needs of Australians for parcel deliveries.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that Australia Post wants to cut delivery services in half. <strong>This is not true. </strong>Australia Post is permitted to adjust its delivery frequency, in metropolitan areas only, from every business day to every second business day. Delivery frequency in rural, regional and remote areas will not change. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that wait times for letters will more than double, from three to seven days. <strong>This is not true.</strong> Mail speed standards for regular interstate letters (mail travelling around the country) have not changed. Whether measured in business days or actual days, the speed of delivery for intrastate mail has changed by only one or two days for regular intrastate letters, not out by four days as suggested.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed regional Australians and small business will be disadvantaged compared to metropolitan areas. <strong>This is not true.</strong> While the delivery frequency of regular mail has been adjusted in metropolitan areas, the delivery frequency for regular mail for rural, regional and remote areas was protected and remains unchanged. Licensed post offices \u2013 which, together with community postal agencies, represent about 2,300 small businesses in regional and rural communities \u2013 have come out in active support of the temporary regulatory changes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that vulnerable Australians will be most impacted by the changes. <strong>This is not true.</strong> The temporary regulatory changes give Australia Post flexibility to provide additional services that better support vulnerable Australians, such as delivering medicines and grocery boxes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that the changes are permanent. <strong>This is not true.</strong> The regulations are written such that changes will automatically end on 30 June 2021. The government will assess the effect of these temporary arrangements before the end of the year, and decide if they are to stay in place for the full period expected. Any extension of the temporary relief measures will be informed by relevant consultations. Such an extension would also be subject to a new disallowance period.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that the government wants to privatise Australia Post. <strong>This is not true. </strong>The Morrison government is fully committed to Australia Post remaining in government ownership. There will be no change to Australia Post\u2019s ownership, which will remain government owned. </li> \n   <li>The Morrison government is committed to supporting Australia Post to provide important postal services to all Australians.<br></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T02:32:35.288Z\">at 3.32am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2e2c68f0839df653845cc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T02:06:18.223Z\">3.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Do not reboot robodebt, says Shorten</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Bill Shorten</strong> also spoke on the government\u2019s reaction to robodebt:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is what you expect government ministers to do, to make sure that what they are doing is legal.

It is particularly important to avoid any interaction with <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/advice-for-people-at-risk-of-coronavirus-covid-19\">people who are at greater risk of severe illness from COVID-19</a>. <strong> Currently there is no requirement for people who attended the Melbourne protest or other protests to quarantine or be tested if they remain well (unless they have been identified as a close contact).</strong></p> \n   <p>Situations like this are a reminder of how important it is for everyone to continue to take steps to protect themselves from COVID-19. This includes practising good hand and respiratory hygiene, staying 1.5m away from other people, staying home when sick, and getting tested if they have cold or flu like symptoms. AHPPC also reinforces the importance of downloading the COVIDSafe app to help public health authorities find people exposed to the virus quickly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T00:39:01.510Z\">at 1.39am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2ca4c8f08969537f78220\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T00:21:36.622Z\">1.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Victoria records four new coronavirus cases</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Victoria has recorded four new cases in the past 24 hours.</p> \n  <p>One was found through routine testing, another two were returned travellers in hotel quarantine and the fourth is under investigation.</p> \n  <p>And no, none of them had anything to do with the protests on the weekend.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T00:54:14.641Z\">at 1.54am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2c7fc8f08969537f7820c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T00:12:51.576Z\">1.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Labor senator <strong>Malarndirri McCarthy </strong>says she would take part in another Black Lives Matter protest if she were in Darwin.</p> \n  <p>And before all the whataboutters start jumping up and down, listen to why she is talking about \u201cif she were in the NT\u201d:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><strong>We have different circumstances obviously in the Northern Territory where our restrictions have reduced quite dramatically over the past month and we can have crowds of up to 500, if not more now,\u201d </strong>she told the ABC.<br></p> \n   <p>We\u2019ve got sporting fixtures where spectators are at the events.

You can feel it in the air. And some of it is racially charged. There\u2019s also a few other issues that we need to get to. Wayne Swan was on our show about half an hour ago saying Pete, Captain Cook statues and the like may be better placed in museums, what do you think?<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Dutton: </strong>Well, I think a museum would be a great place for Wayne Swan. I can\u2019t think of anyone more in the past than Wayne Swan. Really, is he serious? Look, I don\u2019t think ripping pages out of history books and brushing over parts of history that you don\u2019t agree with or that you don\u2019t like is really something that the Australian public is going to embrace. There are good and bad parts of our history. You learn from that. And sit down \u2013 and you see what Netflix has done and the ABC now is trying to do. I just think it is such an absurdity. You sit down with your kids, looking at some of these videos, explaining that slavery was a horrible period in the United States. There was a civil war that took place. Kids learn from all of that. But removing that sort of content from online or from our television sets, I just don\u2019t think makes any sense. People need to learn from history. Need to appreciate those periods. And people will reflect back on us in 100 years and no doubt form their own judgments as well. But I just really think airbrushing history or pretending that something didn\u2019t happen is such an obscure sort of leftwing cause. I don\u2019t think the mainstream public agree with it.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Q: </strong>Richard, you\u2019re left wing, have things gone too far?<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Dutton: </strong>He has got two left wings.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Marles: </strong>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a leftwing cause. I think history matters. People need to be judged in the context of their history. And as Peter said, future generations are going to judge us. They are actually going to judge us on what we do or do not do in terms of dealing with the question of Indigenous disadvantage in this country. That\u2019s what we have got to be focusing on. I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re going to be given a lot of credit for going on a statue rampage. We actually have to be doing something about improving the lives of Indigenous Australians right now and I think that\u2019s what should be our focus.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T00:48:52.795Z\">at 1.48am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2c1438f0839df653844dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T23:42:34.397Z\">12.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For all the international coronavirus news, head here</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/12/coronavirus-live-news-markets-fall-over-fears-of-long-us-recovery-as-brazil-cases-top-800000\">Coronavirus live news: markets fall over fears of long US recovery as Brazil cases top 800,000</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2be718f08969537f781c4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T23:35:47.180Z\">12.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Albanese on statues: 'You can't rewrite history, you have to learn from it'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>called in to Sydney radio 2GB, where he was asked about what is apparently the biggest issue in Australia at the moment \u2013 the tearing down of statues.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My position is very clear, which is that you can\u2019t rewrite history, you have to learn from it.

The Los Angeles Lakers star is forming More Than a Vote, a group with current and former basketball players aimed at protecting voting rights of Black Americans and bolstering voter turnout. According to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/us/politics/lebron-james-voting-rights.html\">the New York Times</a>, James and business partner Maverick Carter will reportedly provide the initial funding for More Than a Vote and the group will organize as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization, meaning it will not engage in any candidate advocacy.</p> <p>The nascent organization begins in the same week that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/voting-june-9-primaries/2020/06/09/df6b8aa2-a9e7-11ea-a9d9-a81c1a491c52_story.html\">Georgia endured hours-long wait times</a>, malfunctioning voting machines and a shortage of poll workers during its primary.

James told the New York Times \u201cI\u2019m inspired by the likes of Muhammad Ali, I\u2019m inspired by the Bill Russells and the Kareem Abdul-Jabbars, the Oscar Robertsons \u2013 those guys who stood when the times were even way worse than they are today. Hopefully, someday down the line, people will recognize me not only for the way I approached the game of basketball, but the way I approached life as an African-American man.\u201d James hopes to use his extraordinary media influence \u2013 he has 66.1m Instagram followers, 46.4m Twitter followers and multiple digital platforms \u2013 to help boost voter turnout. Young said that he hopes to be an influence to other young black men, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/black-voter-turnout-fell-in-2016-even-as-a-record-number-of-americans-cast-ballots/\">a group whose turnout declined in the 2016 presidential election</a>.</p> <p>Since the Supreme Court partially repealed the 1965 Voting Rights Act in the 2013 decision Shelby County v Holder, voter disenfranchisement has become one of the nation\u2019s most urgent political issues: Michelle Obama launched the voting rights organization When We All Vote in 2018 and Georgia politician Stacey Abrams launched Fair Fight Action after she narrowly lost the gubernatorial election to Brian Kemp, who oversaw the election as the presiding Secretary of State and was widely accused of rigging the election (Abrams sued Kemp through Fair Fight Action and the case is pending). More Than a Vote is expected to join forces with both organizations, though neither When We All Vote nor Fair Fight have confirmed any partnership with James\u2019s group.</p> <p>It\u2019s yet another bold undertaking from James, who has gone beyond the standard calls for change and charity donations. The LeBron James Family Foundation has spent millions underwriting college scholarships for low-income students to attend the University of Akron and his elementary school, I Promise, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/education/lebron-james-school-ohio.html\">posted excellent performances</a> in its first district assessments. James did not explicitly reference US president Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KingJames/status/911610455877021697\">whom James once called a \u201cbum\u201d</a>, but his move into the voting rights debate is direct action against a president <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/30/trump-voting-republicans/\">who has linked higher voter turnout</a> to increased likelihood of Republican losses in elections.</p> <p>The debate over voting rights is already one of the nation\u2019s most intense: The Trump administration adamantly opposes any expansion of vote-by-mail despite the public health threat of Covid-19 and Georgia\u2019s debacle during Tuesday\u2019s primaries was just one instance of voters facing long lines and faulty machinery to vote. In April, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/wisconsin-election-voting-rights.html\">the Supreme Court reversed a decision</a> to postpone the forthcoming election in Wisconsin by a week to assure that its residents could safely vote. The ruling forced thousands to go to the polls at the height of the pandemic. A report from the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research indicates that voter registration is down 70% across 11 states compared to 2016, largely due to Covid-19 restrictions.</p> <p>Judging by his public comments, James envisions his foundation doing more than mass voter registration. \u201cYes, we want you to go out and vote, but we\u2019re also going to give you the tutorial,\u201d James told the Times. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give you the background of how to vote and what they\u2019re trying to do, the other side, to stop you from voting.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The advice on protests from Australia\u2019s Health Protection Principal Committee \u2013 the group of experts that advises governments during national emergencies \u2013 has been clear. People should not attend mass gatherings of any kind, because even though rates of community transmission of Covid-19 are low and many states are not reporting any new cases for days in a row, there is still a risk the virus may spread.</p> <p>\u201cAustralians are reminded that in our recent past a single person infected more than 35 others,\u201d the committee\u2019s advice states. \u201cThis virus is very, very infectious. It will be with us in one way or another for many months to come.\u201d</p> <p>But as Australia has made commendable efforts to contain Covid-19, the social and public health consequences of racism have been brought to the fore by the Black Lives Matter movement.

A Victorian man who attended the weekend protest in Melbourne was later diagnosed with the virus, with health authorities saying he was likely infected before the rally. But with community transmission in Australia so low, and the prime minister saying Australia\u2019s goal is \u201csuppression\u201d and not \u201celimination\u201d of the virus, and that major sports stadiums may allow 10,000 people by July, just how risky are the protests?</p> <h2>Is the risk of spread from protests high?</h2> <p>Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said on Friday, \u201cThese sort of events really are dangerous.\u201d But he also said the country has \u201ceffectively achieved elimination\u201d. The issue is there may still be pockets where community transmission is occurring, he said. While widespread testing, especially in Victoria, might help to identify those areas, it is unlikely that all cases have been identified.</p> <p>A professor of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health at Western Sydney University, Aunty Kerrie Doyle, said she personally would not attend protests as she and her husband are at higher risk of complications if they get the virus.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>But I support people who are going and I appreciate people standing up for our mob,\u201d she said. \u201cCommunity infections are almost non-existent, really. Meanwhile, there\u2019s not a day when Indigenous people aren\u2019t targeted. The police know who we are.\u201d</p> <p>She said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/family-of-david-dungay-who-died-in-custody-express-solidarity-with-family-of-george-floyd\">NSW Aboriginal man David Dungay said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times before he died while being restrained by five guards in a Sydney jail</a>. \u201cFinally there is a groundswell of people who have come to understand how serious this issue is,\u201d Doyle said.</p> <p>Prof Mary-Louise McLaws, a member of the World Health Organisation advisory panel for infection prevention and control, said, \u201cYou need to balance perceived risk with real risk and infection control. I think there is always a risk when people gather but the community and myself are confused given it\u2019s OK to go to a crowded airport and sit on a plane for at least 40 minutes without a mask, and you can go to crowded shopping mall or to a supermarket, or be surrounded by people talking at a restaurant.\u201d</p> <p>She said the risk at rallies would depend on crowd behaviour. \u201cAt a rally, people without a mask will increase risks as we know particles can be pushed out at great velocity, especially if you\u2019re shouting. But if the protesters wear a mask and they keep that integrity of the mask during the rally intact, and they stay home if they feel unwell, then the risk is very minimal to negligible.\u201d</p> <h2>What can be done to minimise risk of spread?</h2> <p>The chief executive of the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, Pat Turner, said it was important for protesters to remember that Covid-19 poses a serious risk to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people due to higher levels of chronic conditions in that population, especially in those aged 50 years and older.</p> <p>\u201cThe specific advice of all health authorities is that while Covid-19 remains in Australia that everyone should take precautions including the social distancing and hygiene practices,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThose who attended the rally should take every precaution they can in terms of practical measures to protect themselves and their families. It is important you continue with social distancing, regular hand washing and cough hygiene. If you can, avoid contact with Elders and with people with chronic medical conditions ... If you develop even the mildest of symptoms, stay home and get a Covid-19 test.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s health advice is that people who march in protests don\u2019t need to isolate unless they feel sick, in which case they should get tested.</p> <h2>What are the health impacts of racism?</h2> <p>\u201cRacism makes you sick,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cI think one of the greatest impacts I see is a reluctance among our people to approach others for help. They have internalised that they are a second class and lower class citizen, and that they don\u2019t deserve medical treatment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/how-could-this-happen-indigenous-health-tragedies-spark-search-for-answers\">and if they seek it out, doctors won\u2019t listen</a>.

Yet the disparity remained.</p> <p>\u201cWe know there are protests going on tonight and we at our university are worried about our students and our Indigenous students who go and place themselves in clear and present danger for having their voices heard, but what\u2019s the other alternative?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat can you do when people like Pauline Hanson are out there saying people like Floyd deserve their treatment?\u201d</p> <h2>Two public health objectives do not have to compete</h2> <p>The Public Health Association of Australia chief executive, Prof Terry Slevin, said the community often perceived events as \u201crisky or not risky\u201d. The reality was often more complicated, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us not to depict the protests this evening about being one public health imperative against another; Covid-19 versus advancing the health of Indigenous and Torres Strait islander people.</p> <p>\u201cThe protests are not completely risk-free, but neither is going to the supermarket. It\u2019s very important for people with concerns about Black Lives Matter to have an opportunity to express that and do it as safely as they can. That means not taking a confrontational approach towards protesters but a co-operative approach that minimises risks.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Collin Osborne still wonders why the call to coach representative rugby never came. Osborne worked for Harlequins for more than 20 years, arriving at the club shortly after rugby union turned professional and departing two years ago. In that time he ran the academy and was skills coach when Harlequins were crowned Premiership champions in 2012.</p> <p>It is not that he is bitter, nor does he wish to point fingers but having achieved his qualifications the year after the former England head coach Stuart Lancaster, Osborne \u2013 one of a handful of black coaches to work in the Premiership \u2013 feels the question is relevant. \u201cAs a senior coach, coaching at Harlequins I was never ever once offered or invited to coach any representative side. Surrey U11s to Surrey men \u2013 never. A lot of my contemporaries were. I was at one of the best clubs in Harlequins but I was never asked. I don\u2019t know why it was.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/11/english-rugby-has-no-plans-to-bring-in-the-rooney-rule-for-recruitment\">English rugby has no plans to bring in the Rooney Rule for recruitment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With Osborne no longer at Harlequins the homegrown black and minority ethnic representation on coaching staffs in elite rugby in England is practically non-existent. Joe Shaw is skills and attacks coach at Saracens but the stark statistics show Paul Hull is the only black head coach or director of rugby in Premiership history, having been in charge of Bristol between 2009-11.</p> <p>The Black Lives Matter movement has led to introspection across the sporting landscape and this week the England footballer Raheem Sterling castigated his sport for the lack of opportunities available for black coaches.</p> <p>Given Osborne\u2019s experience, it seems fair to ask whether the pathway exists in rugby, even if the difference in player participation numbers has to be taken into account. Osborne and Hull, who both reached their level five coaching qualification in 2008, feel the question will be more pertinent when the current generation of players are in early retirement. They are optimistic that some will land top coaching jobs should they wish.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the diversity in the England team, hopefully they will go on to coach and young black people will see that and want to follow them,\u201d says Hull.</p> <p>Osborne echoes that sentiment. \u201cI would be very saddened if players like Kyle Sinckler, Maro Itoje and Jonathan Joseph couldn\u2019t get a coaching job if they wanted. I would be very surprised and disappointed if that were the case.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the better question then, is what needs to be done to ensure that happens. Neither the Rugby Football Union nor Premiership Rugby intend to introduce the Rooney Rule but the RFU highlights how more than 30% of last year\u2019s World Cup squad was from BAME backgrounds and believes its focus should be on increasing diversity at grassroots level, pointing to its Project Rugby and All Schools programmes.</p> <p>Contrast that, however, with the rest of upper echelons of the organisation where Maggie Alphonsi is the only black council member and there is no BAME representation on the board.</p> <p>\u201cThe stupid thing is that is the easier part of it to change,\u201d says Osborne, now head coach of Wimbledon RFC. \u201cBeing a rugby coach is a very niche job, there aren\u2019t that many people, white or black, who meet the criteria to do the job in the Premiership or at international level. But the last time I went to the RFU I was in a huge open-plan office and it was exceptionally white. There are loads of people who are qualified administrators, there are not a load of people qualified to be a rugby coach.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"339b566a68a1874987cf1cae672cb9c8c5ac8a7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/339b566a68a1874987cf1cae672cb9c8c5ac8a7a/0_84_3090_1854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Hull is the only black director of rugby in Premiership history.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Hull is the only black director of rugby in Premiership history.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hull is keen to stress coaching requires a specialised skill-set and it is not for everyone. There has to be the desire as well as the aptitude for it. Osborne agrees but he cannot fathom why there is such little representation on the backroom staff of clubs. And he has done his own research to prove it.</p> <p>\u201cOn the websites of the 14 clubs with academies, I looked at their staff,\u201d he says. \u201cSome were broader, including all their academy staff, 30-odd people, others have just their first-team coaches. It\u2019s a snapshot and in the 14 teams there were 302 photographs and 12 were people of colour. You just think \u2018wow\u2019. It\u2019s not that niche a market and there\u2019s no reason why [backroom staffs] should not represent what England is, but it doesn\u2019t. It never has.\u201d</p> <p>Osborne recalls a time when the perception of black players was that \u201cthey\u2019re all right in the sunshine but as soon as it gets cold they\u2019re no good\u201d. Those stereotypes are thankfully outdated but both men still see pigeon-holing black players as a barrier towards progress. \u201cYou find that a lot of coaches, this is not exclusively the norm, but a lot have played in positions where they have influenced the team,\u201d says Hull, who now works at Prior Park College in Bath.</p> <p>\u201cThe hooker, the lineout leader in the second row, the No 9, the nine and 10. It tends to be those decision makers who become coaches. I don\u2019t see that many black players in those key decision\u2011making roles that gives them the confidence to go into coaching. In those positions you are always in the tactical discussions. When you are in those discussions throughout your career then it\u2019s natural to go into coaching.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/11/the-breakdown-urgent-need-transparency-all-sides-rugby-premiership-salary-cap\">The Breakdown | Urgent need for transparency from all sides on Premiership salary cap</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Osborne recalls a promising black fly\u2011half in the Harlequins academy who, playing in a school match, was moved to the wing. \u201cI had a chat with him afterwards and he said the teacher told him he was wasted at fly-half. The irony was that the only time they looked dangerous was when he came off his wing to fly-half, show and go, side-step, side-step, try. Unfortunately that is what you\u2019re dealing with. I don\u2019t think anyone goes out to think: \u2018we\u2019re going to keep you down\u2019. It\u2019s more a lack of thought and understanding and it comes down to stereotyping.\u201d</p> <p>Nonetheless, Osborne and Hull remain optimistic about the future but feel that consistent change has to come from the top.</p> <p>\u201cOften a black person is asked about race but often it\u2019s not us who should be asked the question,\u201d says Hull. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be aggressive in the slightest here but it\u2019s not really our issue. We\u2019re on the other end of it. The changes are not really going to be made by us, it\u2019ll be elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cThe incident with George Floyd has shone a light around the world and I think it will lead to massive, positive change.\u201d</p>",

University say they are so disillusioned by its failure to tackle racism that they no longer feel comfortable working on outreach programmes to attract others to follow in their footsteps, a leading BAME society has said.</p> <p>The Oxford African and Caribbean Society (ACS), the university\u2019s main group representing black students, said it remained committed to widening access, but more needed to be done to foster an inclusive and anti-racist environment.</p> <p>\u201cI cannot in good conscience tell any black student to apply to the University of Oxford,\u201d one student told the Guardian. \u201cThey have made a public statement in support of Black Lives Matter (BLM) but continue to alienate the black students within their university.\u201d</p> <p>Oxford has long been criticised for the lack of diversity in its student and staff bodies, and has invested large amounts of money and effort in its widening participation programmes. Student ambassadors work closely with the university organising workshops, conferences and residential programmes to encourage more black students to apply.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/OxfordACS/status/1268958844887146496\">The ACS statement</a>, which was signed by student union leaders across the institution, said: \u201cThere is a general perception that the university continues to indicate that it is more offended by the identification of racism than the actuality of its lived experience...</p> <p>\u201cIt is with great sadness that we have seen a number of students disillusioned to the point that they no longer feel comfortable being involved with university access and outreach initiatives.\u201d</p> <p>Kesaia Toganivalu, a first-year English student at Magdalen College, said: \u201cIt\u2019s all well and good getting more black students to come to Oxford, the real problem is what happens to these students when they get into the environment\u2026 The university perpetuates an image of tolerance, and wanting to do better, but once you are in the door, you can be treated like a second-class citizen.\u201d</p> <p>In recent days there has been an outcry from black and minority ethnic (BAME) students who have written letters condemning the university\u2019s record on dealing with racism. It has coincided with mass <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter </a>demonstrations across the globe in protest at the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, horror at the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on the BAME community, and a renewed campaign for the removal of a statue of the Victorian imperialist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/protesters-rally-in-oxford-for-removal-of-cecil-rhodes-statue\">Cecil Rhodes</a> from Oxford\u2019s Oriel College.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.ox.ac.uk/students/news/2020-06-10-open-letter-oxford-students-vice-chancellor-and-heads-house\">open letter</a> signed by the heads of colleges, the vice chancellor of Oxford, Louise Richardson, admitted the university\u2019s failings. \u201cWhile much is being done by many committed people, we acknowledge that we are rightly reproached for our collective failure to address the issue of systemic racism properly, and that we&nbsp;have work to do.\u201d</p> <p>On the Rhodes Must Fall protests, Prof Richardson warned against trying to hide the past, and claimed <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/10/exclusive-nelson-mandela-would-have-opposed-rhodes-must-fall/\">Nelson Mandela </a>would have opposed the campaign. \u201cMy own view on this is that hiding our history is not the route to enlightenment,\u201d she <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-52999319\">told the BBC</a>. \u201cWe need to understand this history and understand the context in which it was made and why it was that people believed then as they did.\u201d</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/oxford-college-heads-stand-with-black-students-to-fight-against-systemic-racism\">a letter </a>was published in the Guardian from the heads of all the Oxford colleges advocating the role of education in building racial equality and a post on Twitter stated: \u201cWe\u2019re committed to supporting our community in opposing racism in all its forms, including upholding anti-racist values.\u201d</p> <p>The ACS said, however, there was a discrepancy between the university\u2019s public statements on racism and the lived reality for black students at Oxford, and called for each college to appoint a designated tutor for race. \u201cAt the moment what has been declared publicly, is unfortunately at odds with the real life experiences of black students at the University of Oxford.\u201d</p> <p>Last week the university caused further upset when it <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/oxford-university-delays-admissions-data-world-events_uk_5ed8b754c5b6f3c22ef0232a\">delayed publishing its latest admissions data</a> on the diversity of its students, citing it was not the right time to share data in light of \u201cworld events\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is precisely due to these same \u2018world events\u2019 that Oxford ACS feels that we can no longer delay commenting on the realities of racism not only within Oxford, but actively upheld and enabled by the university and its colleges,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>According to the ACS, those realities include racist comments, posts and actions by students across the university. Victims who denounce racism find themselves accused of \u201cbullying\u201d and \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d, and perpetrators are allowed to evade accountability, the letter said.</p> <p>The ACS also raised concerns about the lack of welfare provisions for black students and criticised the handling of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/05/oxford-university-race-row-george-floyd-joke-hustings-event-christ-church-college\">an incident at Christ Church college</a> last week after a black student called out a racist \u201cjoke\u201d which made light of the killing of Floyd by a white police officer who knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes.</p> <p>Responding to the issues raised in the ACS letter and others, Richardson said: \u201cWe\u2019re determined to support our black students in every way we can.\u201d&nbsp;She said there would be zero tolerance&nbsp;for racist comments or behaviours by staff or students and promised measures including more black counsellors, a university fundraising initiative for scholarships for black students and a review of all equality and diversity training materials that are used across the university and colleges to ensure they are fit for purpose.</p>",

Even so, it\u2019s hard to ignore the sense of foreboding eeriness that comes as the episode progresses, when you start to realise \u2013 through clever scripting and use of archive \u2013 that the story of a white man getting to power by making himself \u201ca cause\u201d for the disenfranchised isn\u2019t a historical outlook. Present-day America shows us that Duke wasn\u2019t an anomaly, but the beginning of a long-standing trend.</p> <p>Some choppy edits make the podcast seem disjointed at times, but the content is there. Towards the end, the presenter, <a href=\"https://slate.com/author/josh-levin\">Josh Levin</a>, who is Slate\u2019s national editor, interjects with a personal connection to Duke\u2019s election victory in District 81 in Louisiana. While its a link I would have liked to have heard about sooner in the episode, all-in-all Slow Burn offers another good, and unfortunately timely, listen.</p> <h2><strong>Talking points</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>If you\u2019re looking to find out more about the doyen of slick, occasionally weepy Canadian rap and R&amp;B, tune into CBC\u2019s new show <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcasts/this-is-not-a-drake-podcast/index.html\">This is Not a Drake Podcast</a>, which launches on 16 June.</p></li> <li><p>Why not try:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/\">Code Switch</a> | <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510343/white-lies\">White Lies</a> | <a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/insane-in-the-fem-brain\">Insane In the Fem Brain</a></p></li> </ul>",

What other countries have handled racism or slavery better than the US? I\u2019m not saying that waving the red, white and blue; but so often people look at America and all they see is blatant acts of racism and then they are deaf, dumb and blind to racism in their own country. I understand why the US gets the scrutiny, because supposedly it\u2019s the cradle of democracy, and we do [racism] better than anyone else!&nbsp;</p> <p>Also, because of Hollywood. Because of television. It is my belief that the US is not a leader in the world because we have more nuclear weapons than anybody; it\u2019s the export of culture. Music, dance, Apple, Nike \u2013 that\u2019s how America dominates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ea592900232ee12b3f790161397aeafeea76d28b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea592900232ee12b3f790161397aeafeea76d28b/0_0_619_619/500.png\" alt=\"George Miller\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/07/mad-max-australian-cinema-ozploitation\">George Miller</a></strong><br>Director</h2> <p><strong>Why do you think we are impelled to tell each other stories?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>First of all, I gotta give love!
