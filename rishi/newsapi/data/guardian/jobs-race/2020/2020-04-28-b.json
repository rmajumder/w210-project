  "<p>Cut early, cut deeply. This is a well-established response by the airline industry in times of crisis and, sadly for 12,000 staff at British Airways, it is always likely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/british-airways-plans-to-make-up-to-12000-staff-redundant\">to mean mass redundancies</a>.</p> <p>A ratio of slightly more than one-in-four jobs at the airline seems astonishing, but it\u2019s hard to argue with the company\u2019s analysis that Covid-19 will undermine demand for flying for \u201cseveral years\u201d. A global recession is certain and travel restrictions may be with us for ages. BA is not being uniquely pessimistic: over in Germany, Lufthansa thinks recovery will take until 2023, with 10,000 job losses possible.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no government bailout standing by for BA and we cannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely,\u201d said its chief executive, Alex Cruz.</p> <p>The first half of the statement isn\u2019t quite right: BA, if it could be untangled from parent IAG, which also owns Iberia in Spain and Aer Lingus, would qualify for a Bank of England-backed loan. The French and Dutch governments have been able to find a fudge for Air France-KLM. The point, though, is that adding debt doesn\u2019t really help in the long-term if the revenues aren\u2019t there \u2013 the sums still have to be repaid.</p> <p>As for the government\u2019s furlough schemes, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is under pressure to extend, or taper them until the autumn. But he plainly cannot afford to underwrite wages for months on end. Amid the current talk about returning to work, the government will be alarmed by BA\u2019s cost-cutting \u2013 but it\u2019s hard to see what it could do to avert it.</p> <h2>A classic display of dividend bravado from BP</h2> <p>The oil environment is \u201cbrutal\u201d, said BP chief executive Bernard Looney, but shareholders can have their dividend anyway \u2013 at least for now.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/bp-plunges-into-first-quarter-loss-after-oil-price-collapse\">display of dividend bravado</a> was probably to be expected since every big oil company likes to promote its balance sheet as muscular. Investors, though, should not mistake willingness to swallow greater quantities of debt for real strength. In the current climate, BP, now carrying an astonishing $51bn (\u00a341bn) of net borrowing, is straining credibility on its dividend.</p> <p>What, for example, is the point of setting a supposedly rigid target for debt if you then ignore it? BP didn\u2019t just miss its 20-30% ambition for gearing \u2013 defined as debt as a percentage of total capital \u2013 it was out by miles. The ratio was 36.2% at the end of first quarter. Even BP expects it remain above 30% \u201cinto 2021\u201d before the trend turns downwards \u201cover time\u201d.</p> <p>The company isn\u2019t twiddling its thumbs, of course. It\u2019s cutting capital expenditure by a quarter this year to $12bn and can probably knock a billion or two off next year\u2019s budget. It will also hack $2.5bn out of costs by the end of 2021 and reckons its cash flows, including a stable dividend costing $8.4bn a year, would then balance at $35 a barrel. In normal times, that would be impressive. The trouble is, Brent stood at $20 a barrel on Tuesday.</p> <p>The full blast of the new oil world will only be felt in second quarter\u2019s figures. Tuesday\u2019s numbers, showing a slide in profits from $2.4bn to $791m, covered a period in which oil averaged $50 a barrel, which feels like a different age.</p> <p>The real decision on the divi, then, lies ahead. For believers in the idea that BP will be able smooth its way through the current turmoil, the shares offer an enticing 10.5% yield. It feels unlikely.</p> <h2>Hong Kong investors\u2019 beef should be with HSBC</h2> <p>Resentful Hong Kong investors won\u2019t agree, but should: the Bank of England did the right thing when it included HSBC in its ban on banks\u2019 distributions to shareholders this year.</p> <p>HSBC\u2019s capital position is currently healthy, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/hsbc-profit-coronavirus-outbreak-world-economies\">profits almost halved to $3.2bn</a> in the first quarter as the first batch of credit impairments arrived. Over the course of this year, provisions could hit $7bn-$11bn, a wide and tentative estimate that could yet become worse. Best to err on the side of caution on dividends.</p> <p>Instead of raging about perfidious regulators in London, Hongkongers should ask their board a few hard questions. Within the first quarter\u2019s $3bn provision, there was a \u201csignificant change related to a corporate exposure in Singapore\u201d, thought to be a bust oil trader. It rather suggests risk controls could have been better.</p>",
  "<p>Just two months ago in the Cabinet Room of the White House, sitting at a table surrounded by a handful of his black supporters, Donald Trump once again praised his job creation record. \u201cBlack people right now are having the best, statistically, the best numbers that you\u2019ve ever had, and it\u2019s really an honor,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody has done more for black people than I have. Nobody has done more.\u201d</p> \n<p>That was 27 February and Trump was also still claiming he had done an \u201cincredible job\u201d with the looming coronavirus pandemic. Now the virus has led 26 million Americans to file for unemployment. While the US Bureau of Labor Statistics will not release unemployment figures broken down by race until the beginning of next month, economists are certain that black Americans are suffering the brunt of Covid-19\u2019s economic impact and will probably suffer the most dramatic consequences of the looming recession.</p> \n<p>Even before Covid-19 hit the US in full force and as the overall unemployment rate hit record lows, black Americans had an unemployment rate that was almost twice the national rate.</p> \n<p>In February 2020 when the overall unemployment rate was 3.5%, a 50-year-low, the black unemployment rate was 5.8%. The white unemployment rate was 3.1%.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe usual relationship that we see between the national unemployment rate and the black unemployment rate is typically really close to a two to one,\u201d said Valerie Wilson, director of the Economic Policy Institute\u2019s program on race, ethnicity and the economy.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhatever is being projected for the national unemployment rate, in most instances, we expect to see something close to twice that for black Americans.\u201d</p> \n<p>This was true for unemployment figures during the Great Recession. The overall unemployment rate <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/193290/unemployment-rate-in-the-usa-since-1990/\">peaked</a> at 9.6% in 2010. For black Americans, it was <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/194151/unemployment-rate-of-african-americans-in-the-us-since-1990/?mod=article_inline\">16%</a>.</p> \n<p>William Rodgers, former chief economist at the US Department of Labor, has estimated that the real unemployment rate for African Americans may have reached 19% in March.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe reason why African Americans bear the brunt of downturns more is that when firing decisions start to occur the least educated and those with the least experience tend to be let go first. There is also continued discrimination in the workplace,\u201d Rodgers said.</p> \n<p>Economists who focus on race have long said that this \u201clast hired, first fired\u201d phenomenon dramatically affects black Americans more than any other group in the US due to the country\u2019s history of racism and segregation of black Americans in the work sector.</p> \n<p>Workers of color, particularly black Americans, have long been <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/reports/2019/08/07/472910/systematic-inequality-economic-opportunity/\">overrepresented</a> in the lowest-paying service and domestic occupations, such as taxi drivers and restaurant servers. Working in these fields leads to lower wages \u2013 black Americans have the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/2019/demo/p60-266/figure2.pdf\">lowest median wage</a> of any racial group in the US \u2013 and the jobs are often seen as the most expendable during an economic downturn.</p> \n<p>Those who got to keep their jobs during the last recession saw little relief even after the recession\u2019s recovery period. Even with a low unemployment rate, wage growth for low-wage workers, especially for black workers, has been slow. Black Americans have seen the <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/state-of-american-wages-2018/\">slowest wage growth </a>compared with other groups of Americans, reaching a growth rate that was four times slower at certain wage distribution levels, according to a 2018 Economic Policy Institute report.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven though overall on aggregate we were in a better position, many of the underlying weaknesses of our economy were still there \u2013 inequality both on class and race,\u201d Wilson said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72b3a7ee270f21d1c16cd75ec5cceaf97ebef309\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72b3a7ee270f21d1c16cd75ec5cceaf97ebef309/0_158_4763_2860/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A policeman directs a citizen where to pick up an unemployment form in Miami, Florida, earlier this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A policeman directs a citizen where to pick up an unemployment form in Miami, Florida, earlier this month.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michele Eve Sandberg/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Low wages have a ripple effect on a family\u2019s ability to save money and build wealth.</p> \n<p>For Yolanda Murray of Detroit, Michigan, not having savings meant weeks of panic trying to figure out how she was going to pay the bills that came on 1 April after she was furloughed from her job at a hotel.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou got the rent, the bills, you got the car insurance, you got groceries and disinfectant supplies \u2026 It\u2019s like how am I going to maintain all of this?\u201d Murray said. Weeks after she filed her application for unemployment insurance, payments started coming in and Murray was able to pay her bills again.</p> \n<p>But Murray has long-term concerns about what an upcoming recession could mean for her. Just a year and a half ago, in October 2018, Murray and her unionized co-workers spent 28 days striking for higher wages and better healthcare. At the time, workers at the hotel had not had wage rises since before the last recession, and healthcare costs were so expensive that Murray could only afford to cover herself, leaving her two children out of her plan.</p> \n<p>The workers reached a deal with the hotel, and she was able to get her children under her healthcare plan, but Murray is worried about what an economic downturn would mean for her and her co-workers. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to see us go backwards right now,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s repeated claims that he has been the best president for African Americans was repeatedly pegged to falling unemployment numbers. But those numbers only tell a partial story, as work by Rodgers and others has shown.</p> \n<p>Black families are especially vulnerable to economic downturns because they lack the savings that can act as a buffer against unexpected layoffs or lost wages. And during the last recovery they lost ground against their white peers.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/recent-trends-in-wealth-holding-by-race-and-ethnicity-evidence-from-the-survey-of-consumer-finances-20170927.htm\">median net worth</a> of black families is $17,600, compared with $171,000 for white families. A white family is likely to have $10 for every $1 a black family has. The percentage of black families that have a net worth at or below zero dollars is 10 points higher than the percentage of white families in the same financial situation \u2013 19% compared with 9%, respectively. And the black homeownership rate is the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/data/charts/fig08.pdf\">lowest</a> of any racial group in the US and has consistently been about 30% <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/data/histtabs.html\">lower</a> than the white homeownership rate over the years, even as the economy was getting stronger.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"344bdc4b-6f96-4fbb-b794-31be5382176e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TKqymsBdllg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWealth allows you to respond to that unexpected health emergency, that broken hole in the tire you have to replace. It also allows you to buy a home, put your kids through school,\u201d said Danyelle Solomon, vice-president of the race and ethnicity program at the Center for American Progress<strong>.</strong></p> \n<p>Having less wealth also has some dire health consequences. Experts agree that being poor has costly effects on a person\u2019s health: for adults living in extreme poverty, being poor can <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/1/9/16860994/life-expectancy-us-income-inequality\">cost up</a> to 15 years of life expectancy.</p> \n<p>It is no surprise, then, that black Americans \u2013 who are less likely to be <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/disparities-policy/issue-brief/changes-in-health-coverage-by-race-and-ethnicity-since-the-aca-2010-2018/\">insured</a> and more likely to have <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2017/16_0241.htm\">existing health conditions</a> than their white counterparts \u2013 have seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/its-a-racial-justice-issue-black-americans-are-dying-in-greater-numbers-from-covid-19\">higher death rates</a> due to Covid-19 compared with any other group in the US. Black Americans made up 25% of <a href=\"https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race\">deaths</a> from Covid-19 in the US though they make up a little under 13% of the US population.</p> \n<p>\u201cNational emergencies, pandemics, epidemics, what they do is they spotlight inequality,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cWhat we see in Covid-19 is no different. It\u2019s highlighting racial disparities at every single level that have been with our society for a very long time.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>His autocratic tendencies are well-known. His sudden absence from public view prompted fierce speculation and rumour. One headline suggested that he was \u201cbrain-dead\u201d.</p> <p>The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s whereabouts remain unknown. But after a lost weekend, Donald Trump bounced back into the spotlight on Monday determined to prove that he is not only healthy but working very, very hard.</p> <p>\u201cThe people that know me and know the history of our Country say that I am the hardest working President in history,\u201d Trump had tweeted on Sunday, apparently stung by a New York Times report that said he spent all morning watching TV and clocks into the Oval Office around noon. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, but I am a hard worker and have probably gotten more done in the first 3 1/2 years than any President in history.

Some wondered if he had retreated to a hermit-like existence following bleach-gate, his bizarre riff last Thursday musing aloud <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/trump-coronavirus-treatment-disinfectant\">that disinfectant could be injected</a> into coronavirus patients.</p> <p>The sorry episode generated open-mouthed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/donald-trump-coronavirus-disinfectant-sarcastic-tipping-point\">disbelief and derision around the world</a>. Coronavirus taskforce members were said to be stunned. For White House aides and Republican allies, it was reportedly the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back: these daily briefings had become a political liability that could cost Trump the presidential election.</p> <p>So there was no briefing on Saturday, nor on Sunday. The official White House guidance said there would be one on Monday. At 9.41am, Trump, whose very self-conception is based on what he sees reflected back through the media, tweeted: \u201cThere has never been, in the history of our Country, a more vicious or hostile Lamestream Media than there is right now, even in the midst of a National Emergency, the Invisible Enemy!\u201d</p> <p>At 10.52am, the briefing was abruptly cancelled without explanation. But at 1.32pm, it was officially back on again, scheduled for the rose garden at 5pm. As a poet once wrote, \u201cWho is in charge of the clattering train?\u201d</p> <p>It turned out the rose garden was decked out with a red carpet and US national flags. Corporate chief executives gave remarks. Trump did not advise anyone to inject disinfectant into their veins, nor did he berate some hapless journalist as \u201ca third rate reporter\u201d, but it could hardly be described as the long-yearned-for \u201cpivot\u201d to a presidential mien.</p> <p>Stung, perhaps, by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/13-hours-of-trump-the-president-fills-briefings-with-attacks-and-boasts-but-little-empathy/2020/04/25/7eec5ab0-8590-11ea-a3eb-e9fc93160703_story.html\">a Washington Post analysis</a> that found over the past three weeks of briefings Trump spent two hours on attacks, 45 minutes praising himself and his administration and just 4\u00bd minutes expressing condolences for coronavirus victim, he read scripted remarks as usual before adding: \u201cWe do grieve.\u201d</p> <p>He went on to script a political attack ad against himself: \u201cThere has been so much unnecessary death in this country. It could have been stopped and it could have been stopped short, but somebody a long time ago, it seems, decided not to do it that way. And the whole world is suffering because of it. 184 countries, at least.\u201d</p> <p>In his old self-promotional style, he boasted: \u201cI built the greatest economy in the history of the world. I built it.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Deborah Birx outlined the taskforce\u2019s new guidelines for state testing. Trump said the US has carried out 5.4m tests, more than double any other country. He did not mention how far it still lags behind per capita, nor how the prominent taskforce member Dr Anthony Fauci has warned that testing levels need to at least be doubled before lockdown restrictions can be relaxed.</p> <p>The president was told that at least one governor reports an increase in the improper use of disinfectants. He said: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why. I can\u2019t imagine why.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if he accepts responsibility for the sharp rise, he answered bluntly: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Someone else wondered if Trump might try to change the date of the November election. \u201cNo, I would never change the date of the election,\u201d he said. \u201cNovember 3rd. It\u2019s a good number.\u201d</p> <p>There was a memorably pointed question: \u201cDoes a president deserve another term after more Americans die in six weeks than the entire Vietnam war?\u201d</p> <p>Trump, who was reportedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">warned about the coronavirus</a> by US intelligence agencies more than a dozen times in January and February, replied: \u201cWe\u2019ve lost a lot of people. But if you look at what original projections were \u2026 we\u2019ve made a lot of good decisions.\u201d</p> <p>Another reporter inquired about Kim\u2019s condition. \u201cI do have a very good idea but I can\u2019t talk about it now,\u201d Trump teased, gameshow-style. \u201cI just wish him well \u2026 I hope he\u2019s fine. I do know how he\u2019s doing, relatively speaking. We will see, you\u2019ll probably be hearing in the not too distant future.\u201d</p> <p>If only the victims of the coronavirus were afforded such presidential compassion.
