  "<p>The race director of the London Marathon has refused to rule out staging the event as an elite-only race in the autumn if social distancing rules make it impossible to run as normal.</p> <p>Hugh Brasher told the Guardian that while organisers still hoped to hold the event with 45,000 mass participants on 4 October, they were now scenario-planning around 10 other options because of the global pandemic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/24/ecb-delay-start-cricket-season-hundred-tom-harrison\">ECB delays start of cricket season again but defers decision on the Hundred</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe flame is still burning,\u201d said Brasher. \u201cAnd is there hope? Absolutely. But you have to do what\u2019s right for society. You usually have 750,000 people out in central London watching 45,000 runners. Then there\u2019s the medics, the 6,000 volunteers and the transport system. There\u2019s masses to take into account when making any decision.\u201d</p> <p>When asked directly whether the London Marathon \u2013 which was due to take place this Sunday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/london-marathon-postponed-to-4-october-in-response-to-coronavirus\">before being pushed back</a> \u2013 might have to be only for elite athletes if social restrictions had not eased completely, Brasher replied: \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know. But in today\u2019s society, you can never say never. We are trying to stay really agile and to keep scenario planning. And at the moment, I don\u2019t want to discount anything until it becomes really impossible.\u201d<br><br>Last month\u2019s Tokyo marathon was staged as an elite-only race, with the field reduced to just 300 runners and the streets largely deserted. Most major spring marathons subsequently decided to postpone their races to the autumn \u2013 but those events also look in doubt with no vaccine in sight and, ominously, the Berlin marathon has already cancelled its race in September.</p> <p>\u201cOur decision will be made by the back end of August at the latest,\u201d explained Brasher. \u201cIt will be based on the government guidelines, and what we and society think is right and what feels right.\u201d</p> <p>Brasher would not confirm whether Eliud Kipchoge and Kenenisa Bekele, who were due to meet on Sunday in a clash for the ages, had signed up for October\u2019s revised race. However he told the Guardian: \u201cWe always want to get the most competitive race. This was going to be the 40th London marathon, and its greatest race. It was going to be spectacular. But we want to make October 4 spectacular too. So that\u2019s what our focus is.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dac6b808b29f8176b33c2159180b093ee6c86fab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dac6b808b29f8176b33c2159180b093ee6c86fab/495_423_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kenya\u2019s Eliud Kipchoge won the men\u2019s race in 2019 marathon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kenya\u2019s Eliud Kipchoge won the men\u2019s race in 2019 marathon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Harding/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last year the London Marathon raised \u00a366.4m for charities, again making it the biggest single-day fundraising event in Britain. And while Sunday\u2019s race will not take place, organisers are still hoping that thousands of people will spend the day raising and donating money for charities as part of a nationwide 2.6 Challenge \u2013 in which people tackle something related to the numbers two and six.</p> <p>More than \u00a31.5m has already been raised for the campaign, and Brasher said he hoped it would prove a lifeline for many charities which usually rely heavily on the race to fund their work.</p> <p>\u201cThe London Marathon is normally about so many scripts and so many stories,\u201d said Brasher. \u201cIt\u2019s the greatest athletes in the world with the everyday athlete \u2013 who are doing this incredible challenge with the gods of the sport such as Kipchoge, Bekele and Brigid Kosgei, on the same day, on the same course, with the same crowd. In fact, the everyday person gets more people watching them. That\u2019s the incredible thing. And, of course, they are raising so much money for charity too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSadly it\u2019s estimated charities will lose \u00a34bn in income as a result of the pandemic. But they are needed more than ever \u2013 and they will be needed more than ever as we come out the other side. That\u2019s why we came up with the idea of the 2.6 Challenge, because charities are such an intrinsic part of society and they need our help.</p> <p>\u201cThe response has been fantastic,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we really hope that Sunday and beyond will show how much we care as a society for all the charities that exist across the UK that underpin a huge part of what makes Britain great.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u201cThe best part of my job is when you make a difference to someone and they say thank you,\u201d says Dawn Toop, who manages a retirement community in Poole, Dorset. At Homelake House, an independent living development, she is responsible for everything from keeping the buildings in great condition to the happiness of residents.</p> <p>\u201cI love the job because it\u2019s so diverse,\u201d says Toop, who has worked for the property management company FirstPort for nine years. \u201cNo two days are the same. I could go from doing a detailed risk assessment one moment to helping a recently bereaved man with his washing machine the next. As well as ensuring that everything is safe for residents, we also do so many little things that affect their lives in a big way.\u201d</p> <p>Toop is one of FirstPort\u2019s 3,250-strong workforce. Between them, they manage 196,000 residential properties across 3,900 developments in the UK.</p> <p>Such a diverse scope of work calls for an equally varied staff base \u2013 and FirstPort is proud of the way it offers careers to people with all kinds of backgrounds and experience. There is no set route to follow to become a property manager, and it\u2019s often those who least expect it who become the business\u2019s most promising rising stars.</p> <p>Managing the properties and communities can be something of a challenge, but a hugely satisfying one. John Bain, a development manager for leasehold flats, freehold houses and commercial units in London, relishes his responsibilities, which include safety. He carries out regular checks on everything from fire alarm systems to emergency lighting, and arranges inspections at three-monthly intervals to examine the condition of buildings.</p> <p>Like his colleague Toop, he\u2019s also there for residents on a day-to-day basis, ready to deal with whatever comes up, whether that\u2019s coping with noisy neighbours or advising on home improvements. \u201cI used to manage a hotel, and this is very similar, except the residents never leave!\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s great to help people improve their surroundings, and to be able to forge the kind of long-lasting relationships that you only get in jobs like this \u2013 we really are part of our customers\u2019 everyday lives.\u201d</p> <p>The role also offers something else that Bain values highly: independence. He says that one of the best things is having the freedom to manage his own diary, plan his day and be flexible. For those managing a home and family of their own, this can be invaluable.</p> <p>It\u2019s all made easier by the use of technology \u2013 a big feature of life at FirstPort. The company has already embraced a range of digital communications to help staff work smarter, as part of an ongoing digital transformation programme to modernise and streamline the complexities involved with managing buildings.</p> <p>The Your Property Online service allows managers and residents to communicate easily about matters such as repairs and payments. Documents and pictures can be uploaded, and managers can quickly contact all the residents on a development if they need to. FirstPort\u2019s teams across the country stay in touch with each other using Yammer and Microsoft Teams \u2013 social networking tools for business \u2013 and through FirstPort\u2019s own intranet.</p> <p>The company offers plenty of scope for career development. Rhys Brown began working at FirstPort as a cleaner, doing just three hours a week. He took every opportunity to drive his career forward, working his way up to supervisor, then assistant manager. Now he is a development manager for the Park 25 community in Redhill, Surrey, as well as the neighbouring Foxboro Business Park.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve done plenty of on-the-job training,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been to different sites, shadowing different managers. FirstPort is keen for all colleagues to train up in-house and has been really supportive of me as I\u2019ve done so. For example, I wanted to do a leisure centre manager course and they set that up for me. If you bring something to them, they\u2019re happy to help you develop.\u201d</p> <p>The company has gone out of its way to make staff development easily accessible, in everything from leadership to resilience, as well as in technical skills such as Excel. Employees are encouraged to improve their knowledge and build their skills through professionally recognised industry qualifications by, for example, taking the Institute of Residential Property Management exams.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c936e326e86b29f76ce99c0437e81767c997b9e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c936e326e86b29f76ce99c0437e81767c997b9e0/129_154_3178_2363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior view of modern apartments\" width=\"1000\" height=\"744\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">FirstPort\u2019s workforce manages 196,000 residential properties across the UK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peter Moore, one of the company\u2019s learning and development specialists, spent five years in operations so he knows first-hand the challenges faced by managers on the ground. And he\u2019s not alone: much of FirstPort\u2019s senior leadership team has experience of practical roles, and staff in management positions take a hands-on approach to supporting and mentoring their teams.</p> <p>Making sure that continuing professional development is effective, Moore says, is all about keeping content up to date and learner-led to ensure everyone gets the most effective learning experience. \u201cThe company encourages us to come up with ideas \u2013 from new processes to boost productivity, to community activities. At the same time, it offers the reassurance of tried and tested skills across its national portfolio.\u201d</p> <p>Along with career development, FirstPort prioritises mental health and wellbeing. This includes a programme to train employees to be mental-health first aiders, each able to provide a non-judgmental listening ear for colleagues who might be feeling down.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re very aware that this can be a demanding job \u2013 and we have many remote workers and lone workers,\u201d says Callum Austin, FirstPort\u2019s internal communications manager. \u201cProperty management is a dynamic career choice, with colleagues taking on a lot of responsibility and making big decisions. We wanted to make sure that there\u2019s always an option to reach out, particularly at a time when a lot of people are going to be feeling anxious.\u201d</p> <p>In the past few weeks, he has created a dedicated website using SharePoint that collates relevant Covid-19 information, updates and policies, aiming to help the workforce feel supported and informed. Alongside all of the internal information, FirstPort has supported staff by making sure all customers have been kept up to date with regular communication and FAQs relevant to their development.</p> <p>That support makes for a great place to work, says Moore, who previously worked for companies such as Phones 4u and the electrical retailer Powerhouse. \u201cIt\u2019s a friendly environment, and it\u2019s been very welcoming for career changers like me \u2013 as long as you can talk to people, we can show you the rest! And whatever you put in, you\u2019ll get out threefold.\u201d</p>"
