Maybe. <br></p> \n  <p>The US is now firmly entrenched at the center of the global coronavirus outbreak, with more than 600,000 people confirmed as being infected by Covid-19 and more than 30,000 losing their lives due to the virus.</p> \n  <p>There are hopes that the US is starting to hit a peak in terms of new infections, followed by a long plateau and then drop, which will open the way to a gradual restart of normal life such as the opening of schools and businesses.<br></p> \n  <p>Anthony Fauci, the federal government\u2019s top infectious diseases expert, has expressed \u201ccautious optimism\u201d that hospitalizations from the virus have started to slow down, although the rise in deaths will lag behind. \u201cOnce you turn that corner, hopefully we\u2019ll see a very sharp decline,\u201d Fauci said. On 13 April Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told NBC that \u201cwe are nearing the peak right now.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>A model relied upon by the White House, from the University of Washington, estimates that the virus will \u201cpeter out\u201d in May and then essentially grind to a halt by the summer. This is based on the experiences of China and Italy, previous coronavirus hotspots.<br></p> \n  <p>But this model, like all predictions, is dynamic and depends upon the application of measures such as social distancing to slow the rate of transmission.

  "<p>\u201cI am a strong person; I am a flawed person. What I am not is superhuman. Nor am I a Strong Black WomanTM.\u201d With this sentence, from the introduction to <em>Hood Feminism</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mikki-kendall\" title=\"\">Mikki Kendall</a> lays down the gauntlet. There will be no reverence here, no tiptoeing around mainstream feminism\u2019s dreams, no grateful acceptance of a black space that is in the gift of white proprietors. From the start, the author is forthright about her purpose and role \u2013 she is the sort of feminist who is here to unsettle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Black girls aren\u2019t magic, they aren\u2019t to be reduced to sassy gifs.

We have been stuck for years now in a rinse-and-repeat cycle of feminism as privilege laundering, where middle-class white feminists work through their gender grievances via the \u201cgirl boss\u201d T-shirt, the \u201cI\u2019m a feminist\u201d necklace and battles on social media. Or as Kendall, an American writer, puts it, \u201clast names, body hair and the best way to be a CEO\u201d<em>.</em> Her book brings it back to the real world, where feminism is about \u201cfood insecurity and access to quality education, safe neighbourhoods, a living wage and medical care\u201d. Kendall uses both anecdote and analysis to make her case. Her survival after her abusive marriage and the raising of her son in poverty were both underwritten by a public service support network that is fast disappearing, and which needs to be revived as a specifically feminist priority rather than simply an economic one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a0d95ee8c4c446024923e129e7e0575ba39cedb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0d95ee8c4c446024923e129e7e0575ba39cedb4/0_0_1500_1337/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mikki Kendall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"891\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mikki Kendall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kendall\u2019s voice is passionate, and moves easily between the personal and the political.

It sounds divisive (and has been accused of being so), but look closer and it\u2019s obvious what Kendall and others mean when they identify cliques and exclusivity among white feminists. They seek not to eject white women from the movement, of course, but to point out how those women, because of their platforms and access, bury the needs of others. Kendall cites as an example the fact that concern about rape culture in the US focuses on the date rape of suburban teens, and not the much higher rate of sexual assault faced by, for instance, indigenous and Alaskan women.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women of colour suffer twice, as the patriarchal state can also be racist</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kendall is often unsparing and honest about issues that aren\u2019t related to racism, pointing out that colourism among black communities predated contact with Europeans. In doing so she pulls off two things at the same time. She exposes the yawning chasm between what constitutes mainstream feminist activism and the urgent needs of women of colour in maternity wards, single-mother households, abusive homes, hungry families \u2013 and those of disfranchised trans people and sex workers. And she does so without absolving her own communities, or elevating them into saintly victimhood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bf1fb70a0e74be51c7128a9cad80780d3ebe557e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf1fb70a0e74be51c7128a9cad80780d3ebe557e/0_0_1000_826/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lola Olufemi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"826\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lola Olufemi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lola Olufemi\u2019s <em>Feminism Interrupted</em> seems also to be a book about the excision of non-white battles from feminism. Yet at its heart it is about the failure of imagination. \u201cBecause we imagine state power as inevitable,\u201d she writes, \u201cit seems ludicrous to think about another way we might organise.\u201d Olufemi, a British writer, identifies the state as an arm of patriarchy. She points out that 57% of women in prison are survivors of domestic abuse, and that universal credit benefits are paid into the account of the highest household earner, usually a man \u2013 making women even more vulnerable to abusive partners. But women of colour suffer twice, as the state can also be racist, as evidenced by the black women discussed here who essentially died at its hand: shot by accident, neglected in poor mental or physical health until they took their own lives or died of illness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/11/how-metoo-revealed-the-central-rift-within-feminism-social-individualist\">How #MeToo revealed the central rift within feminism today</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Olufemi shows how women of colour as victims are readily pressed into service to serve causes but then excluded from activism, and its spoils. The abortion referendum in Ireland, for example, leaned heavily on the cases of two women of colour, but there is little mobilisation for the rest of the maternal experience of women of colour. She points to those middle-class feminists who make much of Muslim women as needing saving from a system of oppression that is \u201cother\u201d, without recognising that oppression is everywhere: in the UK, two women a week are killed by a partner or former partner. Olufemi argues that mainstream feminism is too often obsessed by personal choices: she refers, as others have, to the mind-numbing genre of articles that pose the question: \u201cCan you be a feminist and \u2026 ?\u201d. This frippery turns questions of agency into ones of pleasure, of entitlement, of being worth it.</p> <p>Olufemi takes her feminism so seriously that sometimes it compromises her authorial tone, rendering it drily determined; her work sometimes reads like a military pamphlet. But she makes up for it in optimism, looking ahead to a feminism that includes the experiences of all women. Reading her is to believe that another world is possible.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hood-feminism-9781526622402.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Hood Feminism</a> by Mikki Kendall is published by Bloomsbury (RRP \u00a316.99) and <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/feminism-interrupted-9780745340067.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Feminism Interrupted</a> by Lola Olufemi is published by Pluto (RRP \u00a39.99).

  "<p>Vulnerable parts of the developing world, particularly in Africa, are at risk of sliding into famine as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, while humanitarian relief efforts are being hindered by lockdowns and travel restrictions, according to the UN.</p> <p>Experts raised the spectre of unrest similar to that seen in 2007-08 when food price rises sparked riots around the world, destabilising fragile states and fuelling conflict in ways that are still being felt. They told the Guardian that the world could still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-measures-could-cause-global-food-shortage-un-warns\">avoid such a crisis</a>, but time was running out.</p> <p>\u201cFrom a food security perspective, some places are very close to famine,\u201d said Dominique Burgeon, the director of emergencies at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). \u201cThe number of people on the verge of being extremely vulnerable was already very high. What we fear is that this number will further increase because of the impact of Covid-19 on food security.\u201d</p> <p>Swathes of the horn of Africa were already experiencing severe problems as swarms of locusts have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/13/second-wave-of-locusts-in-east-africa-said-to-be-20-times-worse\">attacking crops over several countries</a>, in the worst such outbreak for 70 years. Before the coronavirus struck, at least 20 million people were estimated to be in danger of acute food insecurity.</p> <p>\u201cThe level of need was already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/12/a-humanitarian-crisis-looms-in-africa-unless-we-act-fast-to-stop-the-desert-locust\">extremely high</a>. The one thing they did not need was one more shock. We are very concerned,\u201d Burgeon said.</p> <p>He said people in the rich world should not see food shortages arising from the coronavirus crisis as a problem for other people. If food shortages begin to bite, the impacts will reverberate across the globe.</p> <p>He drew a parallel with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/apr/13/food.climatechange\">food price spikes in 2007-08</a>, which triggered riots and unrest across north Africa and parts of the Middle East.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a matter of international solidarity, and humanity, but also a matter of global security \u2013 to make sure the situation in some parts of the world does not create food riots,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Burgeon\u2019s assessment was backed by Amer Daoudi, the senior operations director at the World Food Programme, which is serving 100 million people in dire need in Africa, Latin America and south-east Asia.</p> <p>He also pointed to the food price jumps that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/apr/21/food.unitednations\">occurred</a> at the same time as the global financial crisis in 2007-08, and warned of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/apr/29/food.qna\">similar shock</a>. Then, some countries exacerbated the price leaps by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2008/jun/05/romefoodcrisissummitonthe\">banning exports of staples</a> such as wheat. He urged governments to avoid that this time.</p> <p>\u201cRemember in 2007 high food prices led to riots,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world community needs to come together. We can avoid food shortages if we are able to support countries across the globe [that are vulnerable].\u201d</p> <p>Daoudi said food prices had not yet risen sharply as a result of the crisis, and international cooperation could keep food affordable and reaching areas where it is needed, but countries needed to come up with plans for achieving those aims.</p> <p>\u201cFor the time being we are not seeing food prices rise internationally, but we are seeing food prices rise in local food markets,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can avoid food shortages if we are able to supply countries across the globe. But if we interrupt the supply chain, food insecurity will definitely arrive.\u201d</p> <p>The WFP is organising a hub-and-spoke system of air cargo routes, creating \u201cair bridges\u201d to take food to some of the worst-affected regions as ground transport becomes impossible in lockdowns. But these efforts are also being hampered by travel restrictions.</p> <p>\u201cThere are major bottlenecks in transport,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople also can\u2019t access medical services.\u201d</p> <p>Daoudi urged countries to ensure food supply chains are kept open by maintaining free trade, avoiding food export bans and treating farm labourers as key workers.</p> <p>The UN is concerned that if countries embrace protectionist measures, as some have done by restricting exports, then the threat of food shortages will rapidly become real. The chief economist of the FAO, Maximo Torero, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-measures-could-cause-global-food-shortage-un-warns\">told the Guardian last month</a>: \u201cThe worst that can happen is that governments restrict the flow of food. All measures against free trade will be counterproductive.\u201d</p> <p>Funding is also a major issue. The WFP has requested $350m for its initial Covid-19 response, but so far only about $80m has been forthcoming, including \u00a315m from the UK.</p> <p>Last week several major multinational food companies including Unilever, Nestl\u00e9 and PepsiCo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-could-double-number-of-people-going-hungry\">warned</a> that the coronavirus crisis could double the number of people at risk of hunger around the world. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/27/back-poor-countries-fighting-covid-19-with-trillions-or-face-disaster-g20-told\">Leading economists</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-global-leaders-urge-g20-to-tackle-twin-health-and-economic-crises\">former political leaders</a> have also called on the G20 to provide financial support to poor countries.</p> <p>Burgeon said a swift response was crucial. In some of the vulnerable areas in Africa, he said, there were already armed militia and guerrilla groups.

  "<p>Race has always been a tricky subject for Kyle Larson. But, alas, we could not avoid it. He was the biracial Japanese-American phenom who hadn\u2019t just reached Nascar\u2019s highest rung but was being touted as the second coming of Hall of Famer Jeff Gordon \u2026 by Hall of Famer Jeff Gordon. And I am the rare black writer who covers motorsports on a national level. We have to go there.</p> <p>My first meeting with Larson was in the winter of 2014 at a dirt-track racing extravaganza in Tulsa, Oklahoma, called <a href=\"https://www.chilibowl.com/about/\">The Chili Bowl</a> \u2013 an event that definitely causes a chill if you happened to be one of the few non-whites attending for the first time. Larson forever struck me as a reluctant, though accommodating, trailblazer. On the one hand he has a fascinating family history: a mother whose parents were put in a Californian internment camp during the second world war. On the other hand, because of the horror of that experience and the urgency to assimilate afterward, Larson stays mum about that part of his biography.</p> <p>As for the rest, well, it was pretty white bread. To hear him tell it, he grew up no different than many Sacramento boys did in the 90s, inhaling burgers, not speaking Japanese and worshiping at the altar of Gordon. The idea that his own Gordon-esque ascent from dirt tracks to Nascar\u2019s upper echelon would make him a role model to Asian-American fans seemed to leave him as staggered as a blown tire at 200mph. \u201cGrowing up, I didn\u2019t think anything about being Japanese, or [that] I would even have to talk about it when I got older and higher into racing,\u201d he told me back in 2014.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/28/notes-from-an-ungrateful-athlete-why-race-and-sports-matter-in-america\">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: what sports have taught me about race in America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And though he dutifully took on that responsibility \u2013 and the imprimatur of Nascar\u2019s PR-motivated <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_for_Diversity\">Drive for Diversity</a> program despite having little need for the publicity \u2013 it took people like Ryan Iwasaka, an LA-based corporate lawyer who led the effort to name Larson the Japanese Bar Association\u2019s trailblazer of the year, for Larson to appreciate the significance of his role as an agent for inclusion. The more outreach efforts increased, especially when Nascar toured on the West Coast, the more comfortable Larson seemed to be as the face of the sport that Nascar at least aspires to be. \u201cI do feel like I\u2019m making some sort of an impact,\u201d he told me last year.</p> <p>Of course all that went up in smoke on Sunday when Larson was caught calling <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotter_(auto_racing)\">his spotter</a>, a white person, the n-word during a virtual race last weekend. Things escalated quickly. By Monday, Larson was hit with indefinite suspensions from Nascar and his team, Chip Ganassi Racing, which was in full damage-control mode as Chevrolet, McDonald\u2019s, Credit One Bank and other major sponsors distanced themselves from their radioactive racer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/14/kyle-larson-fired-after-nascar-driver-uses-n-word-during-virtual-race\">By Tuesday, Larson was out of a job</a>. This, after his brief social media apology tour on Monday where, among other things, Larson apologized to \u201cthe African American community\u201d and conceded \u201cthe damage is probably unrepairable\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KyleLarsonRacin/status/1249732388625752065\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/RPsp7ARIea\">pic.twitter.com/RPsp7ARIea</a></p>&mdash; Kyle Larson (@KyleLarsonRacin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KyleLarsonRacin/status/1249732388625752065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 13, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>All the while Larson made Nascar a trending topic for all the wrong reasons at a time when there is little else to talk about in sports. Everyone from Stephen A Smith to Charlamagne Tha God to New York Mets pitcher Marcus Stroman (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/STR0/status/1250044580977938433\">who, apparently, is spoiling for a fight</a>) has registered an opinion on Larson\u2019s heel turn. That it couldn\u2019t have happened to not only a nicer guy, but also stock car racing\u2019s model minority, is a twist only the whitewashed world Nascar could offer.</p> <p>Still, let\u2019s be clear: Larson got what was coming to him. Not only is the 27-year-old far too smart for teenage gamer hate speech, but he\u2019s been in the racing game long enough to know the job doesn\u2019t stop when your entire industry moves into the virtual world. What\u2019s more, he just saw Bubba Wallace, the Cup series\u2019 resident black driver, lose sponsorship after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/06/bubba-wallace-quits-nascar-iracing-motorsports-bristol\">he quit an iRace</a> in frustration. The stakes <em>been</em> high, my guy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/14/kyle-larson-fired-after-nascar-driver-uses-n-word-during-virtual-race\">Kyle Larson fired after Nascar driver uses n-word during virtual race</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But canceling him was the easy way out. It gives Nascar too much credit for champions of inclusion when, last I checked, the sport still turns a blind eye to fans <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2017/08/19/confederate-flag-still-important-symbol-nascar-fans/583320001/\">who drape themselves in Dixie flags</a> and Maga hats and whose 40-odd car Cup grid is now down to three diversity program drivers \u2013 Wallace, Aric Almirola and Daniel Su\u00e1rez. It gives Ganassi Racing too much credit for severing ties when, last I checked, there was no Nascar racing going on and <a href=\"https://nascar.nbcsports.com/2019/12/04/kyle-larson-says-his-dirt-track-racing-will-be-key-to-next-contract/\">Larson\u2019s contract was set to expire anyway</a>. (\u201cI told Kyle he can come back from this,\u201d team owner Chip Ganassi told the Associated Press. \u201cHe can even come back from this with our team.\u201d) And it gives his sponsors too much credit for seeming principled when, last I checked, none of them pressure their on-track rivals to nurture drivers who aren\u2019t white male legacy kids. Or, more globally, to pressure their corporate neighbors to make their prejudicial practices in hiring \u2013 and pay and career advancement and lending and living \u2013 a thing of the past.</p> <p>That right there is the real privilege \u2013 the power to oppress, a power that Larson hints at with his use of the n-word but doesn\u2019t have anymore, if he ever had it all. Nascar may even have done Larson a favor by banishing him. More than any young driver Larson, who figured to be the prize of the offseason free-agent market, seemed like he could take or leave Nascar. When he finally did conquer the Chili Bowl earlier this year, after 13 tries he called it the biggest victory of his career, paying short shrift to his six career wins in Cup. He seemed like he would be perfectly happy racing out of the spotlight on dirt tracks and living a much smaller, much simpler life.</p> <p>Certainly, he\u2019s made enough money \u2013 an estimated $10m in 2018 alone \u2013 to make the downsize seamless. But the most disappointing part about Larson\u2019s fall from grace, the most stunning off-track crash I\u2019ve witnessed in my years on the Nascar beat, are the more odious, more bigoted elements of racing fandom coming forward to pledge their allegiance to a driver who looks for all the world like another white-passing Asian who\u2019s down for the cause.</p> <p>No doubt Larson is the biggest loser in all this. But mark my words: he\u2019ll recover. (To paraphrase the activist filmmaker Tariq Nasheed: Traffickers of white supremacy are <em>transferred</em>, not fired, only to return \u201crehabilitated.\u201d) Less certain is whether the progress Larson came to represent will ever get back on track.</p>"
