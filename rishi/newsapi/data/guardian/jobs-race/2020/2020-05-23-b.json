  "<p>This selection of <em>Snow White</em> tales from around the world ends on an unfamiliar note. In the Moroccan story \u201cThe Jealous Mother\u201d, beautiful Lalla does everything you might expect of a self-respecting heroine. After running away from a rivalrous older woman, she takes refuge as housekeeper to seven ghouls, gets tricked into ingesting a ring that propels her into a coma, before awakening from apparent death many months later. The seven ghouls are thrilled when Lalla turns out to be safe but, unlike the seven dwarfs, they have no intention of handing over their domestic drudge to a handsome prince anytime soon. \u201cNow,\u201d they say, \u201cnever answer the door for anyone! Never go out! We cannot afford losing you again!\u201d And so they all live happily ever after.</p> <p>It is sly of folklorist Maria Tatar to end her book with a tale in which Snow White is instructed to stay home and do the washing up rather than follow her own desire. Sly because it goes so spectacularly against the direction of traffic over the past four decades during which feminist scholars and writers have strenuously read against the patriarchal grain of our most familiar folktales. Starting with Angela Carter\u2019s short story collection <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/24/classics.angelacarter\">The Bloody Chamber</a></em> and continuing through to Disney\u2019s 2013 blockbuster <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/05/frozen-review\">Frozen</a></em>, the modern princess is expected to be a bit of a badass. She rules, she fights but, most importantly, she tells the boys what to do.</p> <p>Tatar, who is a professor of folklore and mythology at Harvard, knows all this, but her interest in fairytales goes far beyond the formulaic \u201cgirl power\u201d reworkings of recent years. Instead what she does is seek out versions of <em>Snow White</em> that have been circulating around the world for centuries, ones that replace kings with sultans, apples with pomegranates, and pale maidens with brown-skinned girls. What also gets dislodged is the idea that there is a fixed or single way in which the <em>Snow White</em> story \u201cought\u201d to run.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t mean anything goes. All the tales collected share a recognisable architecture of sexual rivalry, deep sleep and spectacular regeneration. In Greece Maroula is despised by Venus and rescued from a coma by her brothers; Armenian Nourie Hadig has to dodge murder at the hands of her rivalrous mother who is outraged to be told by the moon that she is no longer \u201cthe fairest of them all\u201d. In the Southern states of America King Peacock discovers a girl floating downriver in a golden coffin and revives her by removing a seed from her mouth; while in the Highlands of Scotland Queen Silver-tree instructs her husband to kill their beautiful daughter and serve up her heart and liver for dinner. In several versions, the wicked older woman is punished by having red hot shoes soldered to her feet, forcing her to dance to her death (hints here of a scorched Cinderella).</p> <p>Tatar\u2019s avowed intention is to demonstrate the endless fluidity of folktale narratives, the way they wash into one another so that it becomes hard to know exactly where one ends and another begins. Indeed, many of the variants collected here pick and choose from a range of stories including <em>Goldilocks</em> and <em>Sleeping Beauty</em> to bolster their dramatic impact. Now and then a canonical version of a single tale may emerge, but that is only by chance, because it happens to snag on a particular cultural moment and get written up as if it somehow mattered more than all the others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ec44898a4d2f038f52166c13e38f77f42c044f8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec44898a4d2f038f52166c13e38f77f42c044f8b/94_119_1773_1772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A detail from an 1873 wood engraving inspired by the Grimm Brothers\u2019 \u2018Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A detail from an 1873 wood engraving inspired by the Grimm Brothers\u2019 \u2018Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ZU_09/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is what happened in 1812 when the Grimm Brothers, writing under the romantic spell of an emerging German nationalism, published their version of \u201cSnow White\u201d. Far from being an \u201cauthentic\u201d peasant tale \u201ccollected\u201d from the forests of Westphalia, the Grimms\u2019 \u201cSnow White\u201d is actually a literary construct, carefully stitched together from a whole host of other well-travelled versions. The Grimms tightened the plot, dismissed surplus characters, adopted a curiously flat, affectless tone and made the result sound as if it were the spontaneous expression of an ancient German <em>Volk</em>. Ironically, this is the version that Walt Disney chose to drive further into popular culture when he made his classic animation film of 1937, designed to rouse America from its Depression-era slump \u2013 all that whistling while you work, not to mention a wicked stepmother who appears to be modelled on Joan Crawford. Hitler loved it.</p> <p>The Snow White tales that Tatar presents here are not as slick as the confections of the Grimms and Disney. Instead, many of them seem to wander along their own sweet way. But what this process of defamiliarisation does is alert us to our own myopia in reading hierarchically, as if the white northern European Protestant Snow White is the authentic one, and all the others somehow spoiled or fake.</p> <p>What Tatar urges in her deft and thoughtful introduction is that we read each variation, whether it is from West Africa, Afghanistan or China, with equal attention. For once Snow White, \u201cthe fairest of them all\u201d, migrates into cultures with a history of slavery and race discrimination, a whole new of possible meanings emerges. This provides a way of thinking about how fairytales reveal more than the essentially early 20th-century upper bourgeois insights of Freudian psychoanalysts. There are plenty of examples of mother-daughter rivalries in these tales to be sure, but there is so much more of the material and temporal world \u2013 food, hunger, disease and war \u2013 too.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Fairest of Them All: Snow White and 21 Tales of Mothers and Daughters is published by Harvard University Press (RRP \u00a322.95).

  "<p>As I get older, I find that my once insatiable appetite sometimes lets me down. I hate not being hungry; food never tastes as good when your appetite falters (so I do as much jumping up and down and cycling as my life permits). The things I have an appetite for have changed, too: these days, I prefer lighter dishes and yearn for colourful, vibrant plates of food. Here is a deliciously zippy little dish that feels just right.</p> \n<h2><strong>Moroccan harissa-grilled mackerel with orange and black olive relish</strong></h2> \n<p>You can use pretty much any fish fillets here \u2013 the richness of sardines, say, works beautifully with the relish. Always make sure your mackerel is line-caught.</p> \n<p>Prep <strong>5 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>15 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>4<br><br>2 tbsp olive oil<br>6-8 </strong><strong>mackerel</strong>, cleaned and filleted (or butterflied)<br><strong>2 tsp rose harissa<br>1 cup couscous </strong>(ie, about 150g)</p> \n<p>For the relish<br><strong>\u00bd red onion</strong>, finely chopped<br><strong>1 \u00bd oranges<br>10-12 good quality black olives,</strong> de-stoned and chopped<strong><br>1 heaped tsp coriander seeds</strong>, crushed<br><strong>\u00bd garlic clove</strong>, crushed with a little salt<br><strong>\u00bd bunch coriander,</strong> leaves and stalks roughly chopped<br><strong>3 tbsp olive oil<br>Salt and black pepper</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/05/bbq-linkbox/linkbox-2\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>You can use pretty much any fish fillets here \u2013 the richness of sardines, say, works beautifully with the relish. Always make sure your mackerel is line-caught.</p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/gas 6. Make the relish first. Pop the onion in a bowl and squeeze over the juice of half an orange. Add the zest of the whole orange, then leave to macerate.</p> \n<p>Using a sharp knife, remove the pith from the zested orange \u2013 it helps if you cut off each end, so it sits flat. Prise away the segments and chop into pea-sized pieces. Add to the onion bowl and squeeze in any juice from the skins and core. Add the remaining relish ingredients, season to taste and put to one side.</p> \n<p>Line an oven tray with baking paper and grease with a teaspoon or two of oil. Rub the flesh side of the mackerel with the harissa, then lay them skin-side up on the tray. Season the skin, then roast for eight to 10 minutes, until the skin is crisp and the fish is cooked through.</p> \n<p>While the fish is in the oven, boil the kettle. Pour the couscous into a bowl, add the remaining olive oil and season with a few pinches of salt. Fill the now-empty cup with boiling water, pour this over the couscous, stir once, then cover tightly for five minutes. Remove the lid and check the couscous, adding a little more boiling water, if needed. Once it is cooked, use a fork to fluff up the grains. Dish this out on to plates, pop two fillets (or one butterflied fish) on each plate and spoon over the relish.</p> \n<h2>And for the rest of the week \u2026</h2> \n<p>The relish makes a wonderful dressing for a simple salad of baby gem, cucumber, feta and black olives.

He still was not approved for benefits: \u201cI don\u2019t think this country has the consciousness to do what\u2019s right for its citizens of color, much less its veterans of color. We were asking for entitlements that we had earned.\u201d</p> <p>Kingsberry, commander of the National Association for Black Veterans, noted that many African American soldiers were forced to do menial and degrading jobs upon their return from Vietnam, like cleaning and maintenance, and that some, fed up with the disrespect, wound up dishonorably discharged, denying them any benefits for the rest of their lives. \u201cIt was devastating and heartbreaking, but it was a reflection of the country.\u201d</p> <p>It was difficult to quantify the long-term impacts of this disparate treatment on the health, economic opportunities and quality of life of black veterans, he added. \u201cWhen white America hurts, something has to be done. But when black America hurts, it\u2019s \u2018y\u2019all need to get over it\u2019.\u201d He said he hoped any broader reckoning of this decades-long inequality would address the need for \u201ctrue reparations\u201d.
