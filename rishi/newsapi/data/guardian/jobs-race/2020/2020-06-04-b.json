  "<p>A race relations charity has been reprimanded for paying a former trustee thousands of pounds to write a dubiously sourced report calling the government\u2019s anti-extremism programme Islamophobic, and releasing a press statement accusing a Labour MP of stoking racist abuse against the Pakistani community.</p> <p>In 2018, Just West Yorkshire published a critical report about the Rotherham MP Sarah Champion after she wrote an article <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/16/sarah-champion-complaint-sun-article-british-pakistani-men\">in the Sun</a> headlined: \u201cBritish Pakistani men ARE raping and exploiting white girls \u2013 it\u2019s time we faced up to it.\u201d</p> <p>The charity, which was set up in 2007 with the aim of eliminating racial discrimination, publicised its report by claiming its online survey of 165 people found that Champion\u2019s article had led to an \u201cincrease in verbal and physical racist abuse\u201d.</p> <p>The Charity Commission decided to investigate Just West Yorkshire after receiving complaints about a separate report it wrote, entitled \u201c<a href=\"http://togetheragainstprevent.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Rethinking-Prevent-A-Case-for-an-Alternative-Approach-24-08-17.pdf\">Rethinking Prevent: a case for an alternative approach</a>\u201d. It called for the abolition of the government\u2019s anti-extremism programme, Prevent, which it said relied on \u201cinstitutionalised Islamophobia\u201d. The commission later expanded its investigation after receiving complaints about the Champion claims.</p> <p>After a two-year investigation, the watchdog concluded there was \u201cmisconduct and/or mismanagement\u201d in the administration of the charity.</p> <p>It found Just West Yorkshire\u2019s own research could not justify accusing Champion of inciting racial hatred, and criticised the charity for not being clear about how it sought views about the MP.</p> <p>The commission also criticised the \u201cunbalanced\u201d report on Prevent, which quoted two people, both of whom it said \u201care linked to statements which could be considered to support extreme views\u201d.</p> <p>One of the Prevent report authors was a former trustee of the charity, who was paid \u00a36,000 to write it. Investigators found \u201cno evidence that conflicts of interest were managed, and no agreements or contracts were in place\u201d, the commission said.</p> <p>Last September, the regulator said it intended to issue an official warning to the charity. But before that happened, the trustees dissolved the charity and it was removed from the register of charities on 23 January 2020.</p> <p>The charity\u2019s former chair, Nadeem Murtuja, who in 2017 accused Champion of conduct \u201cbordering on industrial-scale racism\u201d, is now the executive director of communities at Oxford city council, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/regulator-condemns-charity-that-branded-rotherham-mp-sarah-champion-a-neo-fascist-over-sex-abuse-comments-f23mvbhjt\">according to the Times</a>. He said he respected the commission\u2019s perspective but felt it misinterpreted parts of the charity\u2019s report on Champion, which was seeking to make the point that \u201cincendiary comments do incite acts of hate\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Champion said she welcomed the commission\u2019s findings, saying it felt as though Just West Yorkshire conducted a \u201ctargeted smear campaign \u2013 designed to drive a wedge between myself and the community I serve\u201d.</p> <p>She said the report \u201cprovides a huge relief, vindication and draws a line under a very unpleasant period\u201d.</p>",

He came up to their police car, asking for help and saying there were warrants out for his arrest.<br><br>When one of the officers got out of the car, Troyer said Ellis grabbed him by his vest and threw him to the ground. The second officer then came out of the car and wrestled him into handcuffs. He was lying on the ground when he started saying he couldn\u2019t breathe.<strong><br><br></strong>Troyer said officers did not put him in a chokehold or put their knee on his neck. He said they also did not use batons or Tasers, although he was not able to provide any additional details about how Ellis was restrained.<br><br>When Ellis said he couldn\u2019t breathe, they rolled him on to his side and called the local fire department and medical units. By the time they arrived a few minutes later, Ellis was still breathing. He died about 40 minutes later, Troyer said.<br><br>Officials said he looked to be experiencing \u201cexcited delirium\u201d, a condition that can come with attempted violence, unexpected strength and very high body temperature. Troyer said the investigation by the sheriff\u2019s department is expected to be presented to the prosecutor\u2019s office by early next week.</p> <p>Cellphone video footage that appeared to show the arrest and beating of Ellis in March was posted on Twitter on Thursday by the Tacoma Action Collective, a local social justice community group. When asked how the footage was captured, the group said it was shot by a witness whose name would be released later.</p> <p>The Tacoma mayor, Victoria Woodards, called Ellis\u2019s death \u201ctragic\u201d during a press conference Wednesday. She said more information on his death could come as early as Thursday.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIn the face of longstanding racism and recent national events, we are devastated to have the death of Manuel Ellis become a part of this national conversation,\u201d she said.</p> <p>&nbsp;\u201cWe don\u2019t know a lot, but what we do know and what we have heard is deeply troubling to us,\u201d she later added.</p> <p>Ellis was a musician and the father to an 18-month-old daughter and 11-year-old son, according to a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-honor-of-manuel-ellis?sharetype=teams&amp;member=4516054&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=p_na+share-sheet&amp;rcid=0851311b2ff747d086265944d4b85b8d&amp;fbclid=IwAR1PI7bMk1tSvi8ywAtS-Evjkf9B1dd3eLaEVvnNahXrtTe7noVjWUom7ac\">GoFundMe account</a> created five days ago by Monet Carter-mixon, Ellis\u2019s sister, and Black Lives Matter Seattle King county.

He ended up having a challenging childhood, which \u201cled to struggles with addiction and mental health needs, undiagnosed for many years\u201d.</p> <p>But at the time of his death, he was truly loving fatherhood and helping his sister raise her children, the fundraiser explained.&nbsp;</p>",

As the pandemic engulfed New York City and it became the world hotpot, she said her patient caseload shifted from a diverse group of New Yorkers to predominantly black Americans.&nbsp;</p> <p>Among the <a href=\"https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.20.0116\">most important risk factors</a> for death from Covid-19 are chronic conditions, such as diabetes and uncontrolled asthma. Those disparities have been magnified by the pandemic, witnesses said.&nbsp;</p> <p>In just one example of disparities in an important risk factor, 30% of black Americans and 29% of Latino Americans reported suffering from diabetes, compared to only 17% of white Americans, according to a large 2017 study by the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2017/16_0241.htm#:~:text=Racial%2Fethnic%20differences%20in%20the%20prevalence%20of%20chronic%20diseases%20were,%25%20of%20non%2DHispanic%20whites.\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).</p> <p>\u201cLiving in this country has essentially made black Americans sick,\u201d said Blackstock. \u201cOver the last three months we have witnessed a crisis layered upon a crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThis country desperately needs a truth and reconciliation process.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Black Americans have been especially devastated by the pandemic, but the toll has cut across racial minorities in the US. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/us/coronavirus-latinos-disparity.html\">Latino Americans</a> are disproportionately likely to be infected with the disease. Native Americans have also suffered heavily. In just one example, Native Americans in Arizona make up <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/04/12/coronavirus-in-arizona-data-where-who-deaths-impact-location-cases/2979690001/\">less than 5%</a> of the population, but 14% of deaths.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cSystemic racial inequities have festered in our society for years, and are now magnified by the coronavirus,\u201d said the South Carolina Democratic congressman James Clyburn. \u201cThis racial inequity is particularly stark in healthcare, and has been laid bare by this pandemic.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Witnesses also called for better data collection to target resources to geographic areas and demographics where infection is spreading. Testing has long lagged in the federal government response. Congress passed a law requiring the administration to collect and provide certain demographic information about Covid-19 infections, but the Maryland congressman Jamie Raskin called the report \u201ca joke\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, not all lawmakers were willing to lay the disparities at the feet of structural racism.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe need to be careful when interpreting the data,\u201d said Mark Green, a Republican congressman from Tennessee. \u201cIf we draw conclusions this is all due to some race bias in healthcare, we may miss that we need to sterilize public buses.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>At the same time the subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis heard testimony, the House subcommittee on appropriations heard from Dr Robert Redfield. Redfield heads the CDC, which is responsible for controlling infectious diseases within the United States.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe must lessen the impact on African Americans, Hispanics, Latino Americans, Indians and Alaska natives,\u201d said Redfield. \u201cThis nation is not only hearing a wakeup call, we\u2019re hearing a clamoring for equity and healing.\u201d</p>",

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Alok Sharma, the business secretary, has not yet received the results of his coronavirus test, the PM\u2019s spokesman said.</strong> Sharma was tested after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/business-secretary-alok-sharma-coronavirus-test-speech-commons\">falling ill while delivering a speech to MPs from the dispatch box in the Commons yesterday.</a> The spokesman said that, if Sharma did test positive, he would work with the government\u2019s new test and trace system.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman played down the likelihood of Boris Johnson being asked to self-isolate if Sharma does test positive - even though the two men attended a meeting together yesterday - but did not rule it out</strong>. The 45-minute meeting, which was also attended by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, took place in the cabinet room at No 10. The spokesman said that the meeting, like all meetings at No 10, was \u201cproperly socially distanced\u201d and that the participants stayed more than 2 metres apart. The spokesman said that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works#people-who-develop-symptoms-of-coronavirus\">the test and trace guidance </a>was \u201cnot as simple as saying if you have been in a room with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus you are required to self-isolate\u201d. People have to self-isolate if they have had face-to-face contact, at a distance of less than 1 metre, with someone who tests positive, or if they have spent more than 15 minutes within two metres of that person. But the spokesman did not go as far as saying that he was confident that Johnson would not be asked to self-isolate if Sharma tested positive. Asked if Johnson would comply if he were asked to self-isolate, the spokesman said: \u201cWe would follow the advice given by the medical experts.\u201d The spokesman also said that the cabinet room was \u201cvigorously cleaned\u201d yesterday, but that that was usual practice and happened every day.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Downing Street is not reconsidering the government\u2019s move to abandon virtual sittings of the House of Commons in the light of Sharma\u2019s illness, the spokesman said.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman refused to deny a report on Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches last night saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster?page=with:block-5ed638158f084df971c8e2ac#block-5ed638158f084df971c8e2ac\">Johnson told his Italian counterpart on 13 March that he wanted \u201cherd immunity\u201d.</a></strong> Asked about the report, the spokesman said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The position of the government is that herd immunity has never been its policy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But the spokesman did not deny that Johnson had said the words attributed to him in the programme and, when asked if he was willing to clarify this directly with the PM, he suggested there was no need because he had made the position clear.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said 171,829 tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am yesterday.</strong> But the government had the capacity to carry out 220,213, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman confirmed <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/03/exclusive-tens-thousands-covid-19-tests-voided-decision-send/\">the Telegraph story (paywall)</a> saying that tens of thousands of coronavirus tests were returned void after being sent to a US laboratory for analysis.</strong> He said 67,000 tests had been sent to the US, and 29,500 were returned void.

He said in total 4.2m tests had been carried out.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman denied<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/03/exclusive-hairdressers-could-reopen-month-plans-barbers-stylists/\"> a Telegraph report (paywall) </a>claiming hairdressers in England could be allowed to open as early as 15 June.</strong> He said the ambition was to reopen them from July at the earliest.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman did not challenge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/03/two-in-five-schools-in-england-yet-to-reopen-to-any-more-pupils\">a Guardian report</a> saying that in some areas up to 90% of primary schools remained closed this week, even though schools in England are meant to be reopening for some year groups.</strong> One survey suggests 44% of English primaries remained closed. The spokesman said that what happened this week was \u201cbroadly ... in line with expectations\u201d and that \u201cwe expect that attendance will grow over time\u201d. He said official attendance figures would be published next week.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government has ruled out running the school meal voucher system in England over the summer holidays.</strong> But there will be a \u00a39m programme offering some pupils activities and meals, said the spokesman, who also hinted it might be expanded.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government did not agree with the suggestion from Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, that the Covid-19 virus was man-made.</strong> Dearlove made the claim <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/03/exclusive-coronavirus-began-accident-disease-escaped-chinese/\">in an interview with the Telegraph.</a> \u201cWe have seen no evidence that the virus is man-made,\u201d the spokesman said.

In an email to constituents sent out on Thursday 28 May, after Durham police gave their view, he adopted a tone that was very different from the one taken by Braverman a few days earlier.

That may be because some politicians are calculating that what the public really wants most at the end of all this is not change, but something approximating to what life was like before. Boris Johnson has said nothing at all about how the crisis could be a catalyst for progressive change.

  "<p>Britain\u2019s intelligence agencies are working urgently to prevent hackers from hostile states, including China, trying to steal the secrets of a potential coronavirus vaccine, the head of GCHQ has said.</p> <p>Jeremy Fleming said hackers were targeting the UK\u2019s health infrastructure and some of its world-leading research labs, often by using simple techniques.</p> <p>\u201cWe do know that, whether it\u2019s states or criminals, they are going after things which are sensitive to us,\u201d the director general said in a rare interview to the Cheltenham science festival. \u201cSo, it\u2019s a high priority for us to protect the health sector, particularly the race to acquire a vaccine.\u201d</p> <p>He said hackers were often \u201clooking for pretty basic vulnerabilities\u201d such as \u201clures to get people to click on the wrong thing ... where people aren\u2019t backing up properly, or where they\u2019ve got basic passwords and so on.\u201d</p> <p>The chief of the signals intelligence agency did not directly name China or any other country as being behind the cyber-attacks on the NHS and British research labs, but sources indicated that Beijing was often believed to be involved.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the interview, which was recorded three weeks earlier, Fleming described China as, in part, \u201can intelligence adversary\u201d, and said the UK had to navigate a complex relationship with Beijing, made more acute by the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cFor the UK, we see China as an intelligence adversary, we see them as an economic partner, we work with them in some areas, we compete with them in others, and in still others, we call out their behaviours when we don\u2019t think they align with what we expect to see or with our values.\u201d</p> <p>Britain\u2019s intelligence agencies have been pressing for both a reassessment of the UK\u2019s relationship with Beijing, arguing that Britain needs to reduce its dependence on Chinese technology and medical supplies, and a more realistic appreciation of the intelligence threat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Others, however, have gone further, claiming that coronavirus may have leaked from a high-security disease research lab in Wuhan, and that, in contrast to the prevailing research, it may be human-made.</p> <p>Sir Richard Dearlove, who was in charge of MI6 in the run-up to the Iraq war, told the Daily Telegraph on Wednesday that he had seen \u201cvery important\u201d research suggesting that \u201cinserted sections\u201d had been placed on the structures of the virus that bind it to human cells.</p> <p>The research \u2013 by Prof Angus Dalgleish, of St George\u2019s hospital at the University of London and a former Ukip candidate, and the Norwegian virologist Birger Sorensen \u2013 goes against the prevailing scientific and security opinion, which says the virus emerged from horseshoe bats and was passed on to humans via an intermediate animal, such as a pangolin.</p> <p>Whitehall sources reacted with dismay to Dearlove\u2019s intervention, the latest in a long campaign of briefing aimed at justifying a lab leak theory pushed by the US president, Donald Trump. They reiterated they saw no evidence to justify the claim by the former MI6 boss.</p> <p>Last month, Andrew Parker, who was the head of MI5 until April, said of the origins of the coronavirus: \u201cI\u2019m just not aware of any evidence that it is anything other than what people think it is: it came via markets. There are all sorts of hypotheses around, but I just think it is not useful to speculate [or] worry about all that.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Two teenagers have been arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated offences after a number of videos circulated on social media showing a black boy being bullied in West Yorkshire.</p> <p>The videos, which have been viewed more than 1.5m times on Twitter, show a white teenage boy and a white teenage girl repeatedly shouting at the black boy to kneel and kiss their trainers.</p> <p>At least three people filmed the incident, which shows the black boy being slapped by the white boy and goaded by the girl as bystanders laugh.

Trump thrust the issue of race and policing firmly into the culture wars he was fomenting. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s response to police violence was a marked departure from the Obama administration\u2019s. Since Michael Brown\u2019s death, which began a nationwide reckoning and rejuvenated the Black Lives Matter movement, Obama had used his authority to target problematic police departments, including those in Ferguson, Chicago and Baltimore, with justice department investigations.</p> <p>He <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/05/18/407631522/obama-to-limit-police-acquisition-of-some-military-style-equipment\">issued an executive order</a> to curtail local departments\u2019 procurement of certain military-grade equipment. He commissioned a taskforce on 21st-century policing, which <a href=\"https://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/taskforce/taskforce_finalreport.pdf\">memorably urged American law enforcement</a> to move from a \u201cwarrior\u201d to a \u201cguardian\u201d culture.&nbsp;</p> <p>Although America has a sprawling, decentralized system of policing \u2013 the country has <a href=\"https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/nsleed.pdf\">roughly 18,000 police departments</a> each with their own use of force policy, hiring practices and oversight mechanisms making universal reform near impossible \u2013 there were at least signs of tentative progress.&nbsp;</p> <p>And then Donald Trump became the 45th president of the United States.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump's chaotic presidency diverted attention from the debate around police killings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Not only did he <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/49ers/trump-anthem-protesters-get-son-b-field\">fight a PR war against those who knelt during the national anthem</a> to pay tribute to black lives lost and stand against the structural racism underpinning it all.

  "<p>On Monday when Donald Trump raised overhead a Bible \u2013 the Sword of the Spirit, to believers \u2013 he unwittingly cleaved his loyal Christian supporters into two camps.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>His most ardent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/donald-trump-church-photo-op-evangelicals\">evangelical supporters</a> saw it as a blow against evil and described his walk from the White House to St John\u2019s Episcopal church, over ground violently cleared of protesters, as a \u201cJericho walk\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Rev Johnnie Moore, president of the Congress of Christian Leaders, described Trump in <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/johnniem/status/1267598242730192896\">shepherd-like terms</a> on Twitter:</p> \n<p>\u201cI will never forget seeing @POTUS @realDonaldTrump slowly &amp; in-total-command walk from the @WhiteHouse&nbsp;across Lafayette Square to St. John\u2019s Church defying those who aim to derail our national healing by spreading fear, hate &amp; anarchy. After just saying, \u2018I will keep you safe.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>But evangelicals are not monolithic: some saw the gesture as cynical, a ploy by a president whose decisions, both private and public, do not align with biblical principles.</p> \n<p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s a sort of Rorschach test, then,\u201d said Dallas pastor Robert Jeffress, who is one of Trump\u2019s most important defenders among the faithful. \u201cYou see what you expect to see.\u201d</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s not true, Trump\u2019s emerging evangelical critics say: an objective measure is contained in the very book Trump wielded.</p> \n<p>\u201cBlessed are the peacemakers! Blessed are the merciful! It\u2019s right there in the Sermon on the Mount,\u201d said John Fea, a professor of American history at Messiah College. \u201cJust read Jesus.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s photo opportunity required police to attack and push away protesters against police brutality. He walked surrounded by key civilian and military advisers, some of whom later said they were caught unaware by the stunt and the violence that preceded it. Some evangelical leaders said they felt similarly aghast, watching the event unfold.</p> \n<p>\u201cPelting people with rubber bullets and spraying them with teargas for peacefully protesting is morally wrong,\u201d said Russell Moore, president of the Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. \u201cWhat we need right now is moral leadership \u2013 from all of us, in the churches, in the police departments, in the courts, and in the White House. The Bible tells us so. So do our own consciences.\u201d</p> \n<p>The day\u2019s events left Moore \u201calarmed\u201d, he said.</p> \n<p>The staunchest of evangelicals, 90-year-old televangelist Pat Robertson, split from Trump on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>He told his television viewers of the president: \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m ready to send in military troops if the nation\u2019s governors don\u2019t act to quell the violence that has rocked American cities.\u2019 A matter of fact, he spoke of them as being jerks. You just don\u2019t do that, Mr President. It isn\u2019t cool!\u201d</p> \n<p>It could be far worse than uncool, politically.</p> \n<p>Trump can\u2019t afford to lose evangelicals, even by the handful. A record 81% of white evangelicals voted for him in 2016, and he only narrowly won the presidency, sometimes by just a few thousand votes in crucial areas. His gesture with the Bible outside St John\u2019s was meant to shore up that support, reminding his base of a tacit agreement.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a contract between him and evangelical voters,\u201d Fea, the professor, who is a Christian, said. In exchange for their ballots, he said, Trump has packed the courts, including the supreme court, with conservative judges who agree with them on social issues.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>So while evangelicals lifted Trump to power by voting together, they may prove his undoing if a contingent breaks away. In which case his campaign might shudder to hear of evangelical believers like Anthony Kidd in Daphne, Alabama.</p> \n<p>During the week Kidd works at a salvage yard, and on weekends he does audio work during church services. He\u2019s conservative.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cThe past few years he has done things that are good for Christians, I\u2019ll grant that,\u201d he said. But when he saw Trump lift the Bible outside St John\u2019s, he said, \u201cIt made me want to throw up a little bit.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fea said it was unclear what happens next: whether evangelicals will stay by Trump, or make a significant split. But whatever happens, he said, is unlikely to be peaceful.</p> \n<p>\u201cHere\u2019s a good rule of thumb,\u201d he said. \u201cLooking back through history, whenever you see someone in authority using the Bible to justify law and order, it ends badly.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When I first noticed that there were non-black faces in the myriad protests demanding justice for the police murder of George Floyd across the world over the last few days, I thought: it\u2019s nice to see that oppressed black people aren\u2019t the only ones speaking out about the oppression of black people. Because generally that\u2019s been the case. But that feeling of relief dissolved after big organizations such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1266852547890839552\">the NFL</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheCW/status/1267230279078461443/photo/1\">The CW</a>, as well as stars like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaMichele/status/1266460976116719616\">Lea Michele</a>, jumped on that bandwagon to align themselves with the fight for black humanity. Because these are some of the same platforms that have silenced us.</p> <p>I get it; a major impetus for the protests is the lack of accountability \u2013 for the careless condemnation of black life, the quelling of black voices and the utter disregard for our image. Of course, you want to <em>look</em> like the white organization or public figure that is on the right side of history, appealing to the oppressed who are in part frustrated that a country they helped build has once again abandoned them. And truthfully, black people need the support of non-black people to clench justice in a broken nation still run and dictated by white oppressors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/blackout-tuesday-george-floyd-social-media\">As responses to George Floyd's death go, #BlackOutTuesday was embarrassing | Fatima Bhutto</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For one split moment in time, it seemed like some of these influential white entities had finally gotten the point after years of directing their attention toward the absence of accountability, which extends far beyond the court system to the big and small screens as well as our football stadiums.

Black people are long past the point of niceties and respectable dialogue that dances around the issues without solving anything at all. There needs to be indisputable action. Hence the question of accountability, or rather the lack thereof, which brought us to this current juncture. In order to gain alliance and make real change, you have to first acknowledge your own actions as wrongdoings.</p> <p>You have to understand the fight you\u2019re allegedly signing up for \u2013 the fight for criminal justice, the fight for black characters to receive the same level of amplification as their white counterparts, the fight to protest against rampant inequality without fear of repercussions or loss of life. You also have to understand your complicity, which includes remaining silent in the face of injustice.

  "<p>Mallard, a fictional town in Louisiana, is a liminal \u201cthird place\u201d. Established in 1848, it is inhabited by light-skinned African Americans \u201cwho would never be white but refused to be treated like Negroes\u201d. In 1938 it\u2019s the birthplace of \u201ccreamy skinned, hazel eyed\u201d identical twins, Stella and Desiree Vignes.</p> <p>Throughout the opening of this epic novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/21/brit-bennett-the-mothers-abortion-scene-writing-race\">Brit Bennett</a> presents the townsfolk as protective of Mallard\u2019s unique constituency. Those within the community marry to maintain the lightness of bloodlines and to ensure that \u201cthe darkest ones [are] no swarthier than a Greek\u201d. With a judicious hand, Bennett outlines how this regulating of racial purity comes with no small measure of emotional cruelty. This, and the wider conservatism and privations of provincial life, encourages the twins to run away to the relative freedoms of 1950s New Orleans.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Stella\u2019s lie takes her into a deep and jagged introspection that threatens the life she has so painstakingly built</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The girls are convincingly characterised as polar opposites. Stella is bookish, biddable and somewhat dependent on her twin. Desiree is more headstrong and spirited. As they make their perilous way in the Big Easy, their unity is unsettled. Stella soon deserts Desiree, disappearing into a life in which she constructs a new identity and \u201cpasses\u201d as white. Bennett\u2019s second novel following 2016\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/15/mothers-brit-bennett-review-debut-novel\">The Mothers</a></em> largely occupies itself with the consequences of this radical move, which play out through the subsequent generation. With a brisk confidence, the narrative moves between periods, following the twins and their offspring from the 50s to the late 80s. Indeed, among the novel\u2019s great technical accomplishments are the parallels it draws between characters\u2019 experiences across the decades. Stella and Desiree\u2019s struggles are elegantly and inventively echoed in the future challenges encountered by their children.</p> <p>While Desiree\u2019s trajectory is rendered with tenderness, Stella\u2019s decision to forge an existence in which she capitalises on her Caucasian features is the novel\u2019s linchpin. It also draws attention to the dangerous value system within black communities that prizes lightness for its proximity to the authority of whiteness. Equally, Stella\u2019s concerted efforts to \u201cmasquerade\u201d as white to gain safety and opportunity underline how rigorously these things were \u2013 and still are \u2013 denied to people of colour. These aspects of racial politics have long been explored in US fiction. With a panoptic view, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/tonimorrison\">Toni Morrison</a> interrogated the pernicious effects of colourism throughout her oeuvre. Harlem Renaissance writers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/20/passing-film-rebecca-hall-black-white-us-rac\">Nella Larsen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/langston-hughes\">Langston Hughes</a> captured with candour the compromised lives of black people purporting to be white.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/26/10-best-debut-novelists-2020-paul-mendez-abi-dare-anappara-elaine-feeney-beth-morrey-douglas-stuart\">Introducing our 10 best debut novelists of 2020</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bennett is influenced by these forebears, but she is not intimidated by previous literary incarnations of \u201cpassing\u201d: her depiction of Stella brings fresh sensitivity to the trope. The portrayal of Stella\u2019s rejection of her mixed ethnicity is figured, in part, as a sign of trauma; it is a response to the horrific act of racialised violence that indelibly marks the twins\u2019 childhood. Bennett shows us that, for Stella, whiteness presents itself as an irrefutable, unquestionably potent force \u2013 whether in the assassination of Martin Luther King or in the furore caused by a black family attempting to move into the all-white LA neighbourhood where Stella and her husband live in the 60s. It possesses a profound potential to both protect those within its fold and destroy those beyond it; these qualities prove irresistible to a weakened and fragile individual in search of security and solidity. Bennett\u2019s rendering of Stella\u2019s roiling emotions about having to \u201cact white\u201d at all times in case some trace of her origins emerges is powerful, too. Images and subplots associated with this performative aspect of identity are prevalent in the text. We regularly find ourselves in the company of shapeshifting drag queens, a chameleon-like bounty hunter, extravagant soap stars, theatrical estate agents. Some might find this repeated allusion to the theme of pretence grinding or overly emphatic. For me, it mirrored the daily self-policing and continuous effort required in order for Stella to maintain her facade.</p> <p>Bennett is a gifted storyteller. This generous, humane novel has many merits, not least its engrossing plot and richly detailed settings, from smoky small-town diners to gleaming laboratories. The handling of Stella\u2019s secret struggles is, however, an especial achievement. Stella\u2019s lie takes her into a deep and jagged introspection that threatens the life she has so painstakingly built. Yet the novel proves to be a timely testament to the redemptive powers of community, connection and looking beyond the self.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Michael Donkor\u2019s Hold is published by 4th Estate.
