  "<p>MPs are demanding the government holds a review of the national curriculum led by black and ethnic minority leaders and historians to better reflect black history.</p> <p>The cross-party group of more than 30 politicians has written jointly to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to ask for a re-evaluation of the history syllabus in light of the global Black Lives Matter protests over the killing of George Floyd.</p> <p>Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat education spokesperson and a former teacher, said:&nbsp; \u201cWe all have a duty to make sure the next generation, at least, has a better understanding of the historical injustices contributing to institutional racism that persists in the UK and elsewhere today.</p> <p>\u201cAs a former teacher, I know first-hand the value of education as a tool to empower young people to make change happen. That\u2019s why we need to include a more diverse range of historical perspectives in our curriculum and examinations.\u201d</p> <p>The letter, signed by the Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley, Labour\u2019s former shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler and former frontbencher Clive Lewis, members of the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas, said there should be a more balanced reading of Britain\u2019s colonial and imperial past, and its legacy of abuse and exploitation.</p> <p>More recent history, such as the treatment of the Windrush generation should also be included, they suggested, as well as the positive contribution black people and people of all ethnicities have made to Britain.</p> <p>The British empire and its slave trade is not a statutory part of the curriculum, although many schools choose to teach it. Black History Month takes place in the UK in October with resources available for schools.</p> <p>The MPs\u2019 call for a curriculum review follows campaigning by Labour under Jeremy Corbyn to create an emancipation educational trust that would deliver school programmes and focus on African civilisation before colonisation.</p> <p>The civil rights campaigner Paul Stephenson, who who led the Bristol bus boycott in 1963, was suggested as someone all pupils could study.</p> <p>The organisation The Black Curriculum is also collecting signatures for an open letter to be sent to Williamson on making black history compulsory in primary and secondary schools and requesting a face-to-face meeting with him. It would like a response from the minister before Windrush Day on 22 June, which was observed for the first time in 2018.</p> <p>The letter, led by Moran in parliament, comes as Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the curriculum must be improved to break down barriers to defeating racism.</p> <p>She said: \u201cWe must improve the curriculum so that students learn about how Britain was founded on global histories. Students should learn about the achievements and roles of black Britons in every field of human endeavour. And they should learn about the campaigns by black workers for equal treatment and the stand against injustice.\u201d</p> <p>Bousted also called for a review of teacher training to equip all trainees with anti-racist strategies, and a new recruitment strategy to make the teaching profession more diverse</p> <p>\u201cThis term, the NEU will launch an anti-racist framework to respond to the experiences of black children and black staff and to help education staff develop anti-racist approaches,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe support the initiatives from NGOs such as the Runnymede Trust and youth movements such as The Black Curriculum to highlight the importance of challenging the education system to be more inclusive and making the curriculum representative and relevant.\u201d</p> <p>There have been concerns that because academies, which are not controlled by local authorities, have greater flexibility in what they teach and are not required to follow the national curriculum some children may miss out on opportunities to study black history.&nbsp;</p> <p>The current curriculum suggests that within key stage 3 history pupils could look at the British transatlantic slave trade and its effects and abolition. This comes under the broader subject area of \u201cIdeas, political power, industry and empire: Britain, 1745-1901\u201d.</p> <p>The Black Curriculum suggests a broader historical approach, with black history taught through topics such as the pre-colonial black presence in Britain, migration from 1910 to 1960 and assimilation, and a closer look at 21st-century geopolitics, including migration patterns and deportation. <br></p>",

People are upset because racism is a huge problem in our country,\u201d Louie said. \u201cRacism is when people treat other people unfairly because of the way they look or the color of their skin.\u201d</p> <p>The show, which also featured the CNN contributor Van Jones and a number of children asking questions about racism, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/06/06/cnn-sesame-street-anti-racism-town-hall-praised-twitter/3163045001/\">was praised</a> for the effectiveness of its message, but Carlson had a different interpretation, and suggested the two puppets had a different, more sinister, motivation for decrying the treatment of minorities.</p> <p>\u201cGot that, Bobby? America is a very bad place and it\u2019s your fault, so no matter what happens, no matter what they do to you when you grow up, you have no right to complain,\u201d Carlson said.</p> <p>The complaint fits into what is becoming a theme for Carlson.

I know this was the trigger, but the conflagration is really the result of similar incidents that have taken place over many years.\u201d</p> <p>Churches must speak out, he said. \u201cOur faith enjoins us to stand against injustice, sometimes at great cost.\u201d</p> <p>In the UK, he said, \u201cwe must not be under the illusion that we do not have very real challenges here. We do. The inherent inequalities in our own system here, the institutional racism that exists in many of our institutions, must be named and addressed.\u201d</p> <p>Joe Aldred, a bishop in the Church of God of Prophecy, said he understood why so many people had joined protests over racism in the past two weeks despite the risks posed by Covid-19.</p> <p>He said: \u201cMy first instinct was to go, out of a sense of outrage. But on reflection, I decided not to because we are in the middle of a pandemic. Many people have faced a choice between the value of their action and the dangers of Covid[-19]. It\u2019s a dilemma, and I understand why some people choose to go.\u201d</p> <p>The use of force or violence in protest was not a simple issue. \u201cIf we take a puritanical line that we must never use force, many of the battles that were won in the past would not have been won,\u201d he said, citing Nelson Mandela\u2019s use of violent resistance against apartheid. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as saying violence is wrong \u2013 life is more complicated than that.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable with the way in which we move from the cause of the protests to discussing the protocols of the protest itself. We should not shift our gaze from the crime that was committed to the responses to that killing.\u201d</p> <p>Dipo Oluyomi, CEO of the Kingsway International Christian Centre, one of the largest black majority churches in the UK, said the church was sympathetic to the Black Lives Matter protests sparked by Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cAll killing is wrong, but this was a particularly unjust killing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He said the US government should hold an inquiry into the killing, and the UK government should do the same \u201cthe next time a black life is lost in similar circumstances. The perpetrators should be taken through the full legal process. The matter should not be swept under the carpet.\u201d</p> <p>Churches should be \u201cthe first to set an example of intolerance for racism,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, this is not always the case, honestly speaking. The 11am Sunday morning service is often the most divided hour in the church \u2013 if young black people find themselves in majority white-led churches, they are only good for music, not leadership.\u201d</p> <p>Black people in the UK should \u201cexercise patience and work through the issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should not be violent as violence rarely makes things better. You don\u2019t exert your position by carrying placards. You need to get an education, become an entrepreneur.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThen you can earn respect for your achievements and \u2018not be judged by the colour of your skin but by the content of your character,\u2019\u201d he said, quoting Martin Luther King.</p>",
  "<p>The medley of jubilant black, brown and white faces cheering the destruction of Edward Colston\u2019s statue has had many rethinking. Discussing even. Britain, a nation not keen on making much of a fuss, is having to talk about slavery. For too long we would rather have dunked our digestives into mugs of tea and not bothered with dredging up our past. But what if we had all learned at school that <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/tea-british-empire-1536862-2/\">the history of our great British brew</a> is inseparable from our history of empire? While Brits have been embracing lockdown baking, how many will know our national sweet tooth is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/oct/13/lifeandhealth.britishidentity\">the direct result of slave labour on Caribbean sugar cane fields</a>?</p> <p>At this moment, remaining ignorant about such history looks increasingly indefensible. Overnight, it has become a moral imperative to learn both the good and bad of British history. Meanwhile support for organisations that have long been working on \u201cdecolonising the curriculum\u201d has skyrocketed since the killing of George Floyd.</p> <p><a href=\"http://decolonisethecurriculum.com/\">Pran Patel</a>, a consultant on decolonising the curriculum for schools in the UK and beyond, says that over the past two weeks the interest in his work from headteachers has been \u201ccrazy\u201d. For Patel, decolonising the curriculum means exposing kids to the richness of knowledge from what he calls the \u2018\u201cglobal curriculum\u201d. Denying children a wider range of subjects and perspectives does them a disservice. So too does a lack of consideration for how material is taught and who is teaching it.</p> <p>\u201cOur curriculum leaves&nbsp;some of us feeling inferior and others, through no fault of their own, superior,\u201d says Patel. \u201cNobody wins in that scenario. When we teach literature, we should be teaching Dickens but we should also be talking about Tagore. When we teach poetry, we should absolutely be teaching Shakespeare and his sonnets but also Rumi.\u201d</p> <p>Signs declaring \u201cWhite silence is violence\u201d on our streets and social media feeds have forced thousands to act. According to Penny Rabiger, an ex-teacher and member of the <a href=\"http://www.bameednetwork.com/about-us/\">Black and Minority Ethnic Educators Network</a>, this \u201chuge collective white guilt\u201d has led to an enormous volume of traffic to the network\u2019s website. A lot of white educators are logging on and asking how they can bring more diversity into their classrooms. How, too, they want to know, do they start having conversations about race and racial inequality with young people?&nbsp;Rabiger hits a cautious note, though, when she says: \u201cWhite guilt is dangerous. It\u2019s a start but it\u2019s not going to \u2018fix\u2019 racism\u2019.\u201d White educators must, she says, continually ask themselves how racial inequality comes to exist and in what ways they perpetuate it.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We saw the same euphoria after the Mark Duggan shooting but once the anger dies down, the energy to participate dies too</p> <footer> <cite>Brother Nia Imara</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I first speak to Lavinya Stennett, the founder of <a href=\"https://www.theblackcurriculum.com/\">The Black Curriculum</a>, it is lunchtime but she has only minutes to spare. She is in back-to-back meetings till 6pm. Has she noticed an increase of support over the past two weeks? She gives a tired laugh. In the week before Floyd\u2019s death, her website, which details the implicit racial bias of the curriculum, received nearly 1,500 visits. Last week, the figure jumped to 133,000. On Monday, the social enterprise had 1,500 Twitter followers; three days later, that number had ballooned to 80,000.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thousands of teachers and parents are logging on to download its teaching resources.

This is why, in its latest report, The Black Curriculum is demanding that the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, makes black histories mandatory in the national curriculum. Those deluging them with requests clearly agree.</p> <p>For Stennet, the increased exposure is \u201cbittersweet\u201d. She is grateful for the support but is also exhausted. She wants to know that the outpouring of goodwill will last beyond the next weeks and months.&nbsp;</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nabss.org.uk/\">National Association of Black Supplementary Schools</a> (NABSS) was set up in 2007 by Brother Nia Imara, who says he wanted to challenge a media narrative of black children\u2019s underachievement. In the past two weeks, students have come forward offering to volunteer, donations have risen and parents have been in touch to seek advice about setting up their own schools.&nbsp;</p> <p>With the world-weariness of someone who has seen it all before, Imara says: \u201cNABSS received this same euphoria after the 2011 uprising following the Mark Duggan shooting, but, unfortunately, once the anger dies down, the energy to participate in solutions dies down with it.\u201d He hopes that \u201cthis time is different, and people can sustain their urge to make a difference\u201d.

Where words won\u2019t suffice to express the anger and frustration of affected communities, songs give protest a language. This game-changing moment has inspired a new wave of protest songs and underlined the timelessness of others.&nbsp;</p> <h2>YG&nbsp;\u2013 FTP</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NFJtEqO0HU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_NFJtEqO0HU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The possibilities of defunding or abolishing police forces are leading a lot of conversations at the moment.

Lingo\u2019s melodies, in straightforward and dulcet Kendrick-inspired tones, have charged up the protests taking place in London. The idyllic video set on a grey concrete estate sees Lingo weave between a white-robed choir wearing balaclavas and a solid body of men and women dressed in all black as he raps: \u201cBlack don\u2019t mean illegal, they don\u2019t know me / When the blues see red there\u2019s greyness.\u201d The track is a reminder of how insubstantial citizenship can be for black Britons, and of the violent treatment we often receive at the hands of the state.</p> <h2>Keedron Bryant \u2013 I Just Wanna Live&nbsp;</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIuSLBX74Ac\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UIuSLBX74Ac?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The 12-year-old gospel singer who featured on US TV show Little Big Shots moved the world with a 50-second clip of himself singing this song written by his mother Johnetta Bryant. You can see and feel the tension in his voice as he simultaneously sings and pleads the title line, a cappella; it went viral, catching the eye of everyone from Obama to Ellen and Tina Lawson. It feels reminiscent of 1960s choirs, such as the Freedom Singers, who combined the harmonies of the Baptist church with chants from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/civil-rights-movement\">civil rights protests</a>.

When the world constantly displays a complete disregard for black men, this song year after year reminds them of how far they have come and empowers them to do more. As music journalist <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/j5xmz7/bashy-black-boys-british-positive-ten-years-on\">Aniefiok Ekpoudom writes</a>: \u201cFor someone like myself, who had a different accent and first language to my parents, but shared the same surname, Black Boys was an important moment in finding an identity of my own.\u201d</p> <h2>Dua Saleh \u2013&nbsp;Body Cast</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpYjTTbLzu8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QpYjTTbLzu8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Minneapolis native Dua Saleh gives a haunting and empowering take on police brutality in their sombre song Body Cast, released last week. It opens and closes with a woman fiercely defending her rights: \u201cThere is nothing going on here and you are violating my rights!\u201d she scolds as a baby calls in the background. The video sees Saleh walking through empty train tracks folding and rolling with their own words; images of burning buildings, speeding police cars and police with batons litter it, and add to the ominous and rebellious feel of the song.</p> <h2>Kendrick Lamar - Alright&nbsp;</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-48u_uWMHY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z-48u_uWMHY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>When the signature Pharrell-produced vocal harmonies start up this track, it is impossible to not feel goosebumps. This song will be a protest anthem for black movements until justice is served, and then it will be used for a celebration. When Lamar performed it at the 2016 Grammys, he shuffled on stage in a line of black men with chains around their ankles and delivered the most powerful performance of the evening. By that point it had already been used as a chant for students protesting police brutality on campuses, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eminemsrib/status/1270262803383934983?s=20\">today, at protests</a> around the world, it still flows through the streets and lights a fire in demonstrators. This song typifies both the reason why we are protesting and have the strength to carry on. \u201cAnd we hate po-po / Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga / I\u2019m at the preacher\u2019s door / My knees gettin\u2019 weak and my gun might blow\u201d \u2013 a desperate series of images, until he lays a hand on our shoulders: \u201cBut we gon\u2019 be alright.\u201d</p>",

The most simplistic production saw two hours of Anna on a bare stage, sometimes backed with video footage, introducing us to the 15 or so characters she interviewed about what it was like to live in a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/12/notes-from-the-field-anna-deavere-smith-interview\">broken system</a>\u201d in the US. We met young men subjected to racial profiling, Indigenous people driven to crimes by flawed systems and adversity, but when a schoolgirl bore witness to the battering of her young, black friend, whose body was flung across the classroom by a white officer, I broke. Anna wasn\u2019t performing these characters, she was presenting them. It felt like I bore witness to the information first hand and I guess, in truth, the reason I found it difficult to breathe during this show was because the similarities to the UK were uncanny.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9091b87797a1288c42ba178c74162e77906d4b75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9091b87797a1288c42ba178c74162e77906d4b75/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Khai Shaw, Anyebe Godwin and Rachel Nwokoro in Little Baby Jesus at the Orange Tree theatre in 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Startling immediacy ...

The students from a north London comprehensive school performing the piece connected with it instantly. They saw their own reality reflected back to them. A reality in which Joanne, Kehinde and Rugrat have to grow up far too quickly. A reality where the intersection of class, race, mental health and gender is truly brutal. A reality where the three black teenage&nbsp;protagonists&nbsp;live under a perpetual shadow of impending violence.

The style of the writing is surreal and poetic. It\u2019s powerful&nbsp;as well, as the two protagonists struggle to have a normal life but are always judged on the colour of their skin, even by their own community. That is not an argument for \u201cblack people are racists too\u201d, no way. But by presenting prejudice that exists within a black community, Orlandersmith is showing us the bigger picture:&nbsp;how toxic, cruel and soul-destroying racism can be and that the legacy of slavery&nbsp;is still something this entire word has not yet come to terms with.

  "<p>Dr Steven McDonald recently joined a protest against police brutality in lower Manhattan, wearing a white coat and mask, and impervious to the falling rain.

The virus has killed black people at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/nyregion/coronavirus-race-deaths.html\">twice the rate</a> it did their white counterparts.</p> <p>In some ways, he said, the protests spurred by the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police felt like a \u201cnatural extension of that injustice\u201d caused by the pandemic.&nbsp;Police kill black men at <a href=\"https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/\">more than</a> twice the rate than they do white men.</p> <p>Since March, thousands of black health workers across the country have been on the frontlines of the pandemic, even more so in New York, which comprises one-fifth of the country\u2019s cases and deaths. Now, despite the contentious debate about the public health impact of the protests, many are also joining the nationwide anti-police brutality protests, in hopes of dismantling the racist structures that regularly kill black people both in the streets, and in the hospital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"66206a6d4feac721c467edb315623785ab4c5c05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66206a6d4feac721c467edb315623785ab4c5c05/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doctors supporting Back Lives Matter in Central Park protest on 6 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doctors supporting Back Lives Matter in a protest in Central Park, New York, on 6 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew H Walker/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cCovid will not kill you as fast as a bullet,\u201d said Dr Lukmon Babajide, a resident physician at Rutgers in Newark, New Jersey, who joined the protest.&nbsp;</p> <p>Babajide, who wore blue scrubs, said that while he was concerned about people getting sick from the virus, the protest felt equally essential to protecting black lives. He said it has become increasingly clear that institutions are not doing enough to speak out against racial disparities, even though it is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425844/\">well documented</a> that black Americans experience worse health outcomes across countless health issues such as maternal health, heart disease and diabetes.</p> <p>\u201cAnything systemic that continues to put entrenched black people at the bottom and continues to exploit them and kill them, those still aren\u2019t seen as racist,\u201d Babajide said. \u201cThose are just seen as unfortunate facts of life.\u201d</p> <p>The disparities in how black communities are policed has direct impact on health outside of extrajudicial killings. Abuse from the police and disproportionate rates of incarceration can lead to widespread <a href=\"https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2659&amp;context=ulj\">mental health crises</a> and chronic stress, which are linked to heart issues and other ailments. Covid-19, meanwhile, has quickly spread in jails and prisons, illuminating the vicious cycle of over-policing and arrests on public health.</p> <p>For black doctors, however, it\u2019s not only about patients and their communities. It\u2019s also about fighting for their own lives, and how they are perceived in a field where they comprise only <a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/data-reports/workforce/interactive-data/figure-18-percentage-all-active-physicians-race/ethnicity-2018\">5%</a> of the workforce. Physician Darien Sutton, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DoctorDarienMD/status/1268891425858600961\">on Twitter</a>, said he was more worried about driving home after curfew as a black man than contracting Covid, and planned not to wear a mask on his walk to the car. A doctor was arrested during a protest in Brooklyn that week.</p> <p>\u201cProfessionalism won\u2019t save us,\u201d said Chioma Iwelumo, a medical student in New York who came to the protest holding a sign for Breonna Taylor, an EMT and frontline worker who was killed by police in her own home. Iwelumo said many health workers experience racism on a regular basis. \u201cWhen we fight for black people, we\u2019re also fighting for ourselves. This is about patients, but also about me.\u201d</p> <p>Babajide said he is one of two black physicians in his program. McDonald said putting on a white coat feels like a signal to others that he knows how to operate within a \u201cwhite system\u201d, even if he is seen differently when he takes it off. This was apparent at a protest last Friday, when police stationed alongside the health worker protest, organized by Frontlines for Frontlines, remained largely distant and hands-off, even when the health workers marched past curfew across City Hall in their scrubs, masks and coats.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the emotional toll of facing the pandemic and the national dialogue about police brutality could prove heavy in coming weeks. Health workers are already vulnerable to burnout and distress on a daily basis, and have experienced post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/us-nurses-doctors-mental-health-coronavirus\">during</a> the pandemic. Coupled with the ongoing stress of being black in America, some of the protesters were bracing for the impact.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard every single day. I\u2019ve seen mostly black patients coming to the door with really nowhere else to go. It really takes a toll on you,\u201d said McDonald, who has been coping by reading Toni Morrison and joining the protests.</p> <p>For some health workers the protests provided an outlet for the grief and anger, and a way to speak out about the racism they witness both in the world and within the halls of their hospitals.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThis is so important because it\u2019s the medicine for both,\u201d McDonald said.</p>",
  "<p>Here is a list of the quarterbacks who have been signed across the NFL since 23 March: Jameis Winston, Joe Flacco, Geno Smith, Andy Dalton, Blaine Gabbert, David Fales, Mike Glennon and Tyler Bray.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/09/colin-kaepernick-george-floyd-roger-goodell\">Colin Kaepernick sacrificed it all for this moment. Now the work begins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is one name conspicuous in its absence: Cam Newton. The former NFL MVP was released nearly two and a half months ago and yet remains without a team. \u201cI\u2019m told from sources that his market has cooled considerably in the last month or so,\u201d ESPN\u2019s&nbsp;Jeremy Fowler&nbsp;said during a recent SportsCenter appearance. \u201cIt is believed that he spoke to the Patriots at some point early in free agency around March. Since then, nothing.\u201d</p> <p>As a collective, the NFL has seemingly given up on Newton, a player who entered the second half of the 2010s as a bona fide superstar \u2013 someone who was a unanimous top-five selection in any \u201cwhich quarterback would you start a franchise with for the next decade\u201d discussions.</p> <p>Throughout his time in the league, Newton has embodied zeal and energy, a bundle of happiness and ego with an uncompromised passion for football. Now, at just 30, he is talked of in hush tones and whispers.&nbsp;<em>He\u2019s washed up</em>.&nbsp;<em>Doesn\u2019t have it anymore</em>.&nbsp;<em>Too beat up. What a shame.&nbsp;</em>With all that has gone on inside and outside of the football world, Cam Newton\u2019s free agency is hardly at the forefront of anyone\u2019s mind. But it remains objectively bonkers that a&nbsp;former MVP less than two-years removed from high-level play is unable to find a starting job.</p> <p>A reminder: Newton turned 31 years on last month. The last time we saw him on a field fully healthy was during the first 11 weeks of the 2018 season. He was as sparkling and efficient as ever. Each of his key metrics, base and advanced, was at or above his career averages. As always, his accuracy waned (a non-stop frustration with Newton), but he more than made up for it with explosive, game-breaking plays.&nbsp;A shoulder injury&nbsp;tanked&nbsp;the second half of&nbsp;his 2018 season&nbsp;and was followed with a&nbsp;foot injury that robbed him of all but two games in the 2019 season. And like that, the Newton experience was over.</p> <p>At the peak of his powers, Newton was a singular force: A blend of size, speed and arm strength the quarterback position has never seen. He helped take the Panthers to a Super Bowl in a funky offense that was built around his own quirks: his willingness to bang between the tackles and his penchant to mistime some of dropbacks. The team dumped a number of timing passing concepts and instead built an offensive identity around what Newton did best, handing him complete command of the offense.</p> <p>It worked! For that year, Newton was as close to an unstoppable a force as anything we\u2019ve seen this side of Patrick Mahomes. Cheat down to stop the run, and Newton would launch the ball behind the defense. Load up in the passing game, and the Panthers would turn the game into a series of 1v1 matchups, only their one, Newton, was bigger, fast and stronger than anything on your side of the field.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/cam-newton-marcus-mariota-next-team\">Second time lucky: will Newton or Mariota be this year's Tannehill?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That we\u2019re even reflecting on Newton\u2019s past greatness is both fitting and odd.&nbsp;<em>Right now</em>&nbsp;should be the apex of his powers, the moment when his athletic skills and technical nous coalesce to make him a consistent top-five quarterback rather than the high-variance version he was in his early years.&nbsp;He should be the&nbsp;cornerstone of a perennial Super Bowl contender. Instead, he\u2019s a street free agent being passed up for jobs by a fossilized Joe Flacco.</p> <p>Whether or not Newton is still able to ratchet it up to his old level is hardly a debate \u2013 he almost certainly cannot. It\u2019s not as though he\u2019s sustained one serious injury or repeat injuries within the same area. He is now up to multiple injuries in multiple spots, the most recent of which impact his two key traits: his throwing shoulder (throwing power) and his feet (speed). But could he still be an effective starter who could do for a team what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/cam-newton-marcus-mariota-next-team\">Ryan Tannehill</a> did for the Titans last season? Controlling the flow of the game and then making big plays on third downs? Sure. Why not?</p> <p>Almost every team in the league has now settled on its starting quarterback for the 2020 season. And those who may be lukewarm on their starter have made a strong dent in their cap sheet by trying to surround their quarterback with as much talent as possible. Trying to find a spot that has both a potential starting spot for Newton and the money he would command is difficult. The Patriots are about it.</p> <p>Most likely: Newton will have to be happy signing a one-year, incentive-heavy \u201cprove it\u201d deal in which he will have to unseat an incumbent starter.</p> <p>But maybe not. Maybe he thinks the punishment isn\u2019t with it if he\u2019s only walking into a backup gig. Newton has an earned ego, the best kind. He carried an Auburn team on his back to the national championship in college and came within a game of replicating the feat with the Panthers in the Super Bowl. To think he might come in and sit behind Matt Ryan or Ben Roethlisberger or Jared Goff feels fanciful, even if it would make all the sense in the world for the respective teams.</p> <p>Newton was a paradigm shifter when he entered the league, the kind of new-age, spread-option quarterback who helped revolutionize a conservative league. Will he be a paradigm shifter on the way out?<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Is this the new life cycle of professional quarterbacks?</p> <p>We have become accustomed to dropback, rhythm passers playing to their 40s. That the Packers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/27/aaron-rodgers-green-bay-packers-nfl-draft-jordan-love\">would plan for a future beyond their 38-year-old quarterback</a> came as a shock. But as the era of Manning, Brady, Brees, Rodgers and Roethlisberger ages out of the league, mobile quarterbacks will have a monopoly on the landscape.</p> <p>While Newton represents one of the high points of that style, it is a skill set that is more available than ever before. If college and high school teams are not putting their best athlete at quarterback at this point, they\u2019re getting left behind.</p> <p>As the league shifts wholesale to an embrace of spread-option, pace-and-space concepts, perhaps the career arc of quarterbacks will change with it: get in, wow, get hurt, get out \u2013 kind of like running backs or wide receivers.&nbsp;<em>This is my number and I\u2019m not playing unless you reach it and I\u2019m good with that.</em></p> <p>In Newton\u2019s case, that would be a shame. The Panthers failed to supply him with a team that was consistently equipped to compete deep in the playoffs. In the season that the Panthers went to the Super Bowl \u2013 when Newton infamously failed to dive for a loose ball \u2013 that image of Newton failing to spring to the ground for it has lived on in the consciousness. It has been through the meme cycle and is now a fully baked-in part of his legacy. So has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/feb/08/cam-newton-sulked-after-losing-super-bowl-50-and-thats-ok\">his post-game performance</a>, with opinions ranging from sore-loser-whiner to great-competitor-who-hates-to-lose depending on the opinion-givers innate bias.</p> <p>For that to be the lasting image of Newton\u2019s career, a potential championship right-there-but-lost<em>, </em>would be a shame. Too often he was forced to drag a moribund bunch to the playoffs (with a strong assist from a consistently brilliant defenses). As the team gathered towards competency again, his body gave out.&nbsp;</p> <p>Here\u2019s hoping he can rebound, that this isn\u2019t the end of Newton as a starter but a speed bump on the way to a fascinating second act.</p>",
  "<p>Chokeholds, or \u201clateral vascular neck restraints\u201d, have been banned by many American police departments since the 1990s. This is sometimes hard to remember because there have been so many deaths since then, using precisely this technique. Chokeholds look like a kind of judo manoeuvre: an arm thrown around the neck followed by a slow squeezing pressure applied to the carotid artery. It can quickly disable an adversary, although more than a few seconds of applied pressure can kill.&nbsp;As in judo, a knee to the neck accomplishes much the same end.</p> <p>The police chokehold is a sensitive issue among African Americans. The history of black death by suffocation evokes an ugly history that is not limited to lynching with nooses. Many do not remember that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/22/rodney-king-riots-25-year-anniversary-los-angeles\">Rodney King</a> was not only beaten with batons, but that one officer, Theodore Briseno, put his foot on King\u2019s neck to hold him down.&nbsp;Perhaps because King did not die, that small fact is lost in today\u2019s discussions.&nbsp;</p> <p>But this week has been all about the dead. Eric Garner died in 2014 and his name usually begins the litany.&nbsp;He was arrested for selling \u201cloosies\u201d, or unwrapped single cigarettes. Officers threw him to the ground, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/eric-garner-nypd-chokehold-homicide\">applied a chokehold</a> and held him down until he died. We know this incident well because angry crowds gathered, begging officers to let him go as Garner cried out 11 times: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d We know this because bystanders took lots of pictures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/america-george-floyd-protests-trump\">A week that shook a nation: anger burns as power of protests leaves Trump exposed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Garner\u2019s name is chanted like a mantra in the long, sad sequence of more recent deaths of black Americans, deaths by many means. Breonna Taylor, Philando Castile, Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown. That sequence now culminates with the name of George Floyd.&nbsp;Arrested on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill, Floyd was thrown to the ground where he succumbed after nearly nine minutes, with the full weight of police officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s knee held on his neck.&nbsp;Again crowds gathered.&nbsp;Warnings were shouted as Floyd\u2019s life slipped away.&nbsp;Clear pictures were taken.&nbsp;</p> <p>The world has exploded since then. Floyd\u2019s death has been a lightning rod for demonstrations around the planet. While much attention has centred on the behaviour of the four police officers at the scene \u2014 and particularly upon Chauvin\u2019s carelessly cavalier demeanour throughout \u2014 the harm should not be thought of as limited to these officers\u2019 behaviour, nor ought it be confined to the question of police reform. Here, for example, is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/30/someone-who-didnt-know-better-might-think-death-by-underlying-health-conditions-was-murder/\">the initial charging document for&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/30/someone-who-didnt-know-better-might-think-death-by-underlying-health-conditions-was-murder/\">Floyd\u2019s death</a>, issued by the Minneapolis medical examiner:&nbsp;\u201cThe autopsy revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.&nbsp;Mr Floyd had underlying health conditions including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease. The combined effects of Mr Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>This is an astonishing description, a shameful circumlocution.&nbsp;</p> <p>But of course Floyd did die by asphyxiation.&nbsp;That much is so obvious that the medical examiner\u2019s report reads like systemic bureaucratic corruption, indicating more than simply the lethal indifference of a single \u201crogue\u201d officer.&nbsp;Blaming Floyd\u2019s death on \u201cunderlying health conditions\u201d is a remarkably determined deflection of Chauvin\u2019s agency.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the end, Floyd\u2019s family hired an independent coroner who confirmed lethal asphyxiation.&nbsp;And quickly thereafter, a final report was issued by Minnesota\u2019s coroner, who logged the official cause of death as strangulation.</p> <p>The linguistic effacement of agency often directs gaze in powerful ways, tells us where to look and where not to.&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/21/police-release-video-of-kajieme-powell-shooting-in-st-louis\">Kajieme Powell</a> was a black man with mental health problems.&nbsp;In 2014, he took snacks from a convenience store and tossed them on the street,&nbsp;allegedly brandishing a&nbsp;steak&nbsp;knife. He called out to the police: \u201cShoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me now.\u201d They obliged him, 12 times over.&nbsp;</p> <p>The police\u2019s actions were explained with what has since become a fairly common appellation,&nbsp;\u201csuicide by cop\u201d, or police-assisted suicide.&nbsp;It is an interesting deployment of the passive. It eliminates official responsibility by recasting a trigger-happy officer as the extended will of the deranged, self-sacrificing Powell.&nbsp;He did it to himself.&nbsp;No one\u2019s fault but his own.</p> <p>This is a feature of the trope of black bodies killing themselves.&nbsp;It echoes the degree to which higher rates of Covid-19 infections among African Americans are often blamed on biological difference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/genetics-bame-people-die-coronavirus-structural-racism\">rather than the circumstances of their lives</a> \u2013 the toll too frequently referenced as solely the product of \u201cco-morbidities\u201d such as obesity, asthma, bad choices, genetic \u201cpropensity\u201d.&nbsp;But poverty creates petri dishes for the virus: black, poor and older people die at higher rates in America because their social circumstances have ghettoised them into tight, poisoned geographies, like bugs placed in a jar, with the cap screwed on tightly.&nbsp;</p> <p>As we watch, two great tragedies unfold and intertwine: the toll of coronavirus, and the toll of extrajudicial deaths at the hands of state actors. One maps on to the other in a double helix of grief and despair. Americans are yearning to resolve the incoherence of this moment.&nbsp;This emotional tinderbox must be read against the backdrop of other events.&nbsp;We respond not merely to the misuse of police power but also to the bewildering federal mismanagement of life-sustaining resources amid a global pandemic:&nbsp;we watch the mishandling&nbsp;in every possible way, of food distribution, of subsidies and financial assistance, of medical equipment.&nbsp;</p> <p>This perfect storm of collective smothering \u2013 a foot on all our necks \u2013&nbsp;has made the image of Floyd\u2019s death even more exceptionally powerful. It is legible to such a broad political spectrum because the resonance of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d makes us cringe with sorrow, induces frightening political constrictions, yet doubles also as coronavirus\u2019s power to make its victims literally gasp for breath.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is such a fragile moment.&nbsp;Perhaps we sit on the razor\u2019s edge of real reform. Or perhaps we will never find our way out of the linguistic maze that keeps turning the dead into deadly agents of their own demise.</p> <p>\u2022 Patricia Williams is a professor of law at Columbia University and a regular columnist for the Nation</p>",

These are issues that the diocese of Bristol, like many organisations, has been aware of, discussed and attempted to address. However, while we have taken some positive steps, it is clear that we have not done enough.\u201d</p> <p>Pereira launched a discrimination case against the diocese of Bristol after discovering the letter on his file. Michael Hill, the bishop of Bristol at the time, wrote in July 2016: \u201cI think the other thing I need to say, having worked closely with people from the Indian subcontinent in my past, is that I think there are cultural differences in the way people like Alwyn communicate, and actually handle issues of truth and clarity.\u201d</p> <p>Pereira, who is now a vicar in Aldershot, Hampshire, is not from the Indian subcontinent. He is of Indo-Portuguese heritage, was born in Kenya and educated almost entirely in England.</p> <p>In a preliminary hearing, an employment tribunal heard that emails dating back to 2014 showed several bishops had blocked Pereira\u2019s job applications, one citing \u201ccultural eccentricities\u201d.</p> <p>The employment tribunal dismissed the claim last month on the grounds it was out of time. Pereira made an internal complaint that was also ruled out of time by the C of E\u2019s clergy discipline commission tribunal, a decision he is appealing.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI suspect my journey [in the church] has been impeded by systemic racism, because of my skin tone.\u201d</p> <p>The support by bishops for Black Lives Matter felt like \u201cPR spin\u201d, he added.</p> <p>In a statement, Hill said he had used \u201cracial stereotypes which were unacceptable and offensive\u201d in his letter. \u201cI deeply regret the incident and I wholeheartedly apologise.\u201d<br><br>Faull said Hill\u2019s comments had been \u201cunacceptable\u201d.
