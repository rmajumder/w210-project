  "<p> In its prime, Tumblr introduced me to a bunch of TV shows that weren\u2019t accessible during Australia\u2019s pre-streaming era. The exceptionally loud and proud sci-fi fandoms made their presence known on the site, sharing handmade gifs of Doctor Who and a far lesser-known show with a cult following, Canadian sci-fi thriller Orphan Black. After indulging my curiosity and heading to a legally dubious website to check out the first episode, I was quickly hooked.</p> <p>Orphan Black, which premiered in 2013, follows grifter Sarah Manning (Tatiana Maslany), who witnesses the suicide of a woman who looks exactly like her. After digging a little deeper, Sarah discovers she is one of hundreds of clones living around the world, many of whom are being hunted down or monitored by people close to them.</p> <p>There is not one constant antagonist throughout Orphan Black. Rather, from season to season, new figures emerge, each with their own agendas and alliances. The show explores themes of identity, agency and the ethics of modern science, while Sarah, involuntarily swallowed up by all this, wishes to be free of it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do_BCA-vR9E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/do_BCA-vR9E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Throughout the series, Maslany plays five individual characters on a regular basis, each with their own traits, history, passions and flaws. There\u2019s Alison, the archetypal soccer mum; Cosima, the developmental scientist with a mysterious genetic illness; Helena, Sarah\u2019s twin who was raised a trained killer by a religious cult; and Rachel, a self-aware clone who works for the dark side.</p> <p>At times, Maslany will even play characters pretending to be other clones, with just enough uncanny resemblance to make it convincing that she\u2019s layering their personas. These roles earned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/apr/17/orphan-black-review-tatiana-maslany\">plenty of positive acclaim</a> for her at the time, and a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/07/10/orphan-black-and-tatiana-maslany-got-snubbed-by-the-emmy-awards-heres-why-thats-not-shocking/\">heap of criticism</a> directed at the Television Academy when she didn\u2019t nab an Emmy nomination in 2014. The primary cast is rounded out by Jordan Gavaris (playing Sarah\u2019s adopted brother Felix) and Maria Doyle Kennedy as their foster mother, Siobhan Sadler.</p> <p>Clone stories are nothing new in sci-fi, but what sets Orphan Black apart is its deeply tangled web of shady underground groups and their public-facing puppets \u2013 all set within a modern-day western metropolis. When one thread is unravelled by the heroes, it only leads to more. Cut off one head and two grow back in its place. This isn\u2019t just a hero v villain story, it\u2019s a hero v villain v another villain v self-interested actor story.</p> <p>As we stay locked away inside our homes, no doubt you\u2019ll hear reminders to make your own fun or keep connected with loved ones from afar. At the start of the series, it was nearly impossible for Sarah to do the latter. As the show progresses and the walls begin to close in, it\u2019s the unexpected love and support of the \u201cclone club\u201d that remains a constant throughout.</p> <p>Orphan Black explores the narrative of being connected with family in the most unusual of circumstances, and the joy that comes with finding pockets of cathartic relief in a timeline filled with despair. Granted, most of us don\u2019t need to catch a break after thwarting paramilitary plots. But much like for the protagonists, this shaky period in our lives has left us desperate to lay low, regroup and, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2020-04-02/coronavirus-grief-and-sadness/12113238\">for many, grieve</a>.</p> <p>In the finale of season two, after Sarah and her daughter escape from Rachel\u2019s clutches, Cosima puts on a record and dances it out with her sisters in Felix\u2019s apartment. Moments of respite are far more memorable when they\u2019re few and far between.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsTc_o5ixU8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DsTc_o5ixU8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><em>\u2022 Orphan Black is available to stream on Stan.</em></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Unemployment up a tad to 4%. Job vacancies and pay growth down a fraction. Britain\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/uk-unemployment-coronavirus-ons-figures-jobs\">latest official labour market figures </a>are a bit like the Domesday Book: comprehensive and rich in detail but of historical interest only.</p> <p>The contrast between the US and the UK is stark. On the other side of the Atlantic economists can already have a reasonably good shot at estimating the impact of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a> on unemployment because there are weekly updates on the number of people filing jobless claims. In the past four weeks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/16/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economic-toll-jobless\">these have totalled 22 million</a>.</p> <p>In Britain, the statistics are not nearly so timely.

But this doesn\u2019t tell us much either. The US jobless claims are a genuine flash estimate: they provide information about what was happening last week, whereas the UK figure doesn\u2019t even give a full picture of what was happening last month.</p> <p>This is a point made by two labour market experts \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/recession-depression-data-coronavirus\">D</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/recession-depression-data-coronavirus\">avid Blanchflower</a> and David Bell \u2013 in a study due to be published by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research later this week. They estimate that the US unemployment rate will have risen almost five-fold in April to 20%. Given the paucity of data, all they can reliably say about the UK is that it has gone up a lot, but they have a stab at an estimate nevertheless.</p> <p>On the assumption that furloughed workers are in reality unemployed, Blanchflower and Bell predict unemployment in the UK will rise by 5 million to more than 6 million by the end of May. If they are right, this would give the UK a jobless rate similar to that of the US \u2013 about 20%.</p> <p>The government would argue that the whole idea of the furlough scheme is to ensure that the lockdown does not result in a massive increase in unemployment. But Blanchflower and Bell are right to say that furloughed workers are really an army of the hidden unemployed, and they will become a lot more visible if during the second half of this year, the government ends the wage subsidies but the economy does not snap back as quickly as ministers hope.</p> <h2>The wrong sort of cheap oil</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/oil-prices-fall-below-zero-coronavirus-barrels-crude\">Falling oil prices </a>are normally good for growth because cheaper crude means business costs come down and consumers have more disposable income.</p> <p>This time is different, not least because you can\u2019t take advantage of less expensive fuel if your business is shut down or your car is sitting on the drive for weeks on end.</p> <p>Oil prices are weak because the global economy is weak. There are specific reasons that explain why the cost of benchmark US crude has gone negative, but there has also been a 60% drop in the cost of Brent crude, which doesn\u2019t have the same storage capacity problems.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"newsletter\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Over the next few weeks, it is not hard to envisage the cost of petrol on UK forecourts falling below \u00a31 a litre.

The MTA was following state and federal guidelines. It wasn\u2019t until 15 April that New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, told people to wear masks or face coverings in public whenever social distancing was not possible.</p> \n<p>But MTA workers argue the transportation authority should have known what was coming. \u201cThey didn\u2019t start taking personal protective equipment seriously until March 30. The first transit worker died on March 27. They waited until multiple workers died to start taking it seriously. We were sacrificial lambs,\u201d said Canella Gomez, an MTA subway operator for eight years.</p> \n<p>Gomez claimed a supervisor told him last month to talk to his union in response to requests to improve social distancing at the Bedford Park subway terminal in the Bronx. He also criticized the MTA for only providing temperature checks to supervisors in the subway division.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a slap in the face to every member of my department who is not sick, still coming to work to try to make their broken system work,\u201d added Gomez.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c7807c56d3f70c88a56341be133d59e65d184c3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c7807c56d3f70c88a56341be133d59e65d184c3/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An MTA worker cleans turnstiles at the Times Square subway station.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An MTA worker cleans turnstiles at the Times Square subway station.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeenah Moon/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Seth Rosenberg, a MTA subway operator, also noted he was told by a supervisor to talk to his union over concerns he expressed on 17 March about operating equipment not being sanitized and cleaned every round trip in between different co-workers using it.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey told me it was my responsibility, not the MTA\u2019s responsibility, and if I had safety concerns I should talk to the union,\u201d said Rosenberg. \u201cOur labor has been considered essential.

She said MTA officials have been frustrated by the lack of support from federal authorities.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe feel incredibly let down by the fact the federal authorities were specifically telling us not to distribute medical and personal protective equipment.

And not only did we catch it, we are now the king of ventilators all over the world.<br><br>\u201cWe have thousands being made a week and they\u2019re very high quality and that wasn\u2019t playing well, so then they said, \u2018Testing, testing, ah, we\u2019ll get him on testing\u2019. Well, testing is much easier than ventilators.\u201d<br><br>In fact governors\u2019 demands for ventilators were based on the White House\u2019s own projections and, far from being new, their pleas for testing go back many weeks. Trump\u2019s words are also unlikely to comfort the afflicted for whom a ventilator is a lifeline.<br><br>Later at Monday\u2019s briefing, the president\u2019s ability to show empathy was again in question. </p> \n  <p>Yamiche Alcindor of PBS News recalled one of her interviewees: \u201cA man said his entire family got sick because they listened to you and didn\u2019t stay home. Are you concerned that downplaying the virus got people sick?\u201d<br><br>Trump\u2019s stunning reply: \u201cA lot of people love Trump, right. A lot of people love me, you see them all the time, right. I guess I\u2019m here for a reason. To the best of my knowledge, I won, and I think we\u2019re gonna win again. I think we\u2019re gonna win in a landslide.\u201d<br><br>The president went on to tout his travel restrictions on China, adding that \u201cbefore March\u201d he also banned travel from Europe (it was in fact announced on 11 March). The back and forth continued. Trump asserted: \u201cI haven\u2019t left the White House in months except for a brief moment to give a wonderful ship, the Comfort \u2013\u201d<br><br>Alcindor interjected, accurately: \u201cYou held a rally in March.\u201d<br><br>Caught red-handed, the president said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Did I hold a rally? I\u2019m sorry, I hold a rally. Did I hold a rally?\u201d<br><br>For a moment, the illusionist\u2019s mask had slipped.

The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included.

That is significantly better than rates in hard hit countries such as Italy, Spain, the UK and France, and similar overall to Iran, which was also an early hotspot. But death rates are higher in the US than Germany, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and many other countries. </p> \n  <p>The death rate in China had been recorded as 4% of cases and 0.2 deaths per 100,000 population. That was before the Chinese government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/china-denies-cover-up-as-wuhan-coronavirus-deaths-revised-up-50\">increased</a> the official death toll from Wuhan, the original base of the outbreak, by 50%. And there are ongoing questions about all of China\u2019s reported numbers in relation to the coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, the New York Times has published a long and useful <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-death-rate.html\">article</a> detailing the enormous difficulties in pinpointing death rates in different countries and even different areas and populations within countries.</p> \n  <p>The virus swept in so quickly and is still so relatively new that we are only now grasping that there may be huge numbers of people who have or had Covid-19 without showing symptoms, have not been tested or who died at home or in a care home without that death ever being verified as resulting from coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The New York Times gives a rough rule of thumb that, according to various unofficial Covid-19 trackers that calculate the death rate by dividing total deaths by the <a href=\"https://qap.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/COVID-19.html\">number of known cases</a>, about 6.4% of people infected with the virus have now died worldwide. But it adds that \u201chealth officials and epidemiologists have estimated there are five to 10 people with infections for every confirmed case in some communities, and at least one estimate suggests there are far more\u201d.</p> \n  <p>So ultimately the worldwide death rate, if it can ever be verified, is likely to be a much, much lower number than currently understood. And data for the US and other countries could change a lot going forward.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T22:03:43.249Z\">at 11.03pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9e15c48f0895b8b228320d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T21:41:00.495Z\">10.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump press conference begins</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The president is at the podium now, talking about his guidelines for reopening the country. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9e148d8f08ce473efe2a17\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T21:35:20.852Z\">10.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Joe Biden gets progressive House endorsements</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>While we wait for the White House briefing to begin, here\u2019s some quick non-coronavirus news: a number of former Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters in Congress have officially endorsed Joe Biden: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/cmarinucci/status/1252295568086335490\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New!
