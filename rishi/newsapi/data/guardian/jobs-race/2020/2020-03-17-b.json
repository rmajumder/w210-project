However, other parts of the text suggested the parliament could accept a less demanding agreement not to retreat from existing standards (non-regression). The ambiguity is a sign of a compromise text stitched together to meet the expectations of MEPs spanning conservative right to radical left.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"532df0a3-11ca-4d4e-8f76-d04fd6d181ce\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(January 31, 1961)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Brefusal</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain\u2019s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a \u201cdeep-seated hostility\u201d towards the European project.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 31, 1973)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Brentry</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>With Sir Edward Heath having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/29/the-highs-and-lows-of-britains-47-years-in-the-eec-and-eu\">signed the accession treaty</a> the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 31, 1975)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Referendum</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted \"yes\".

It was \u201ca British upbringing on German territory\u201d while attending a British primary school. As a child he was conscious of living in the most eastern outpost of the west. \u201cMany people who grew up in West Berlin have a very strong desire for the democracy and the rule of law.\u201d</p> \n<p>When his family moved to a West German spa town when he was 11, he switched to a German school. In 1989, he did two years\u2019 national military service in a tank battalion, when he also learned to drive a lorry while training in the Canadian prairies of Manitoba.</p> \n<p>During his teenage years he became a member of Germany\u2019s centre-right Christian Democratic Union party. Several decades on, he remains a loyal supporter of the outgoing German chancellor. \u201cI am in favour of Angela Merkel\u2019s announcement that she wants to finish this term. This is not only about Germany, this is about Europe and we need Angela Merkel\u2019s experience and her negotiating skills,\u201d he said, dismissing suggestions the party was tired.</p> \n<p>He is convinced that Europe needs more foreign policy clout in the world. \u201cWe should really show ambition in the next few years to make the European Union a global player. Because at the moment we are a global payer,\u201d he said, a reference to the EU\u2019s aid budget, the largest in the world. In this, he is aligned with the \u201cgeopolitical\u201d ambition of the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, another CDU politician from Lower Saxony.</p> \n<p>Can the EU\u2019s geopolitical hopes thrive without one of the continent\u2019s biggest military and diplomatic players?</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have to, we can\u2019t revoke the UK decision. Of course with the UK the European Union is stronger than without. That\u2019s common sense. Let\u2019s try in the field of foreign and security policy to continue this close foreign and security co-operation.\u201d</p> \n<p>That might sound promising to Downing Street, although he is unconvinced of Frost\u2019s view that Britain\u2019s exit could be good for the UK and Europe: \u201cThere is nothing good about Brexit.\u201d</p>"
