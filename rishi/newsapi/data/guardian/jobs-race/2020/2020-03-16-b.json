  "<p>After TWO premieres and TWO casts, it\u2019s the bit we\u2019ve been waiting for \u2013 the queens meet. Let the backhanded compliments and thinly veiled nastiness ensue. It\u2019s ALMOST as good as that bit in Four In A Bed where they\u2019re forced to explain to each other\u2019s faces why they underpaid by \u00a33.50. Almost, but not quite (\u201cI just really felt the poached eggs weren\u2019t up to scratch and also we found a pubic hair under the kettle\u201d).</p> <p>This one also kicks off with a written statement addressing Sherry Pie-gate. It explains that they\u2019ve decided, for the sake of the other queens, to proceed as planned, and that Sherry has been disqualified from the competition. It is on screen for a full 14 seconds. Which doesn\u2019t sound like very long, but on a show that\u2019s edited with roughly the same poise and coherence as a hungover oyster, a silent pause like this stands out and has an impact. They really want you to know that Sherry Pie will most certainly not be passing go, and absolutely will not be collecting ONEHUNDREDTHOUSANDDOOOOLLARS.</p> <h2>Clash of the queens</h2> <p>After the initial obligatory shady entrance, suddenly both cliques are hugging and smiling \u2013 Jan and Brita know each other from New York. In fact, five of the girls are from New York. A considerable chunk, and perhaps a slight oversight from the show\u2019s casting directors. There are so many incredible drag scenes in the US, and the more we get to see of those, the better. Despite not being especially racially diverse, something Drag Race UK did very well was represent drag from across the UK. Except Scotland. And Wales. And the UK\u2019s gayest town, Brighton. Ok, maybe it didn\u2019t do it that well actually. NEXT.</p> <p>The episode 1 queens are all looking stunning, and we\u2019ve just worked out who Gigi reminds us of \u2013 Denise Richards! The button nose, gorgeous eyes and a slight look that says she\u2019s wondering whether she locked the back door when she left the house. Nicky Doll says \u201cwe just met the bitches and they\u2019re already starting to complain.\u201d Bienvenue a Drag Race, Nicky! \u201cWe\u2019ve been through some shit\u201d says Jackie Cox darkly. Jackie \u2026 it\u2019s only been a week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26d73e305667d442d38f1507678a2128520f39f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26d73e305667d442d38f1507678a2128520f39f0/420_59_1629_977/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gigi Goode\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gigi Goode ignores the coronavirus protocols.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images  for VH1 &quot;RuPaul's Drag Race&quot;</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>It\u2019s not personal</h2> <p>Everyone\u2019s in the workroom and Rock is wearing <em>those</em> grey shorts again. Don\u2019t pretend you didn\u2019t notice them last week. RuPaul is dressed like a Balamory cast member who\u2019s just been made redundant. SO many people are wearing glasses. Do drag queens need glasses more than other people? Maybe because of eye makeup? Is that a thing? We\u2019ll get The Guardian\u2019s team of trained opticians onto it. Just kidding, they\u2019ve been redeployed for coronavirus planning.</p> <p>Next in a real dick move from Ru, but one that undeniably makes great television, the two winners from the last two weeks (Widow and Jaida) are tasked with lining up the other queens in order of how good they think they are. \u201cIt\u2019s not personal\u201d says Ru. Well \u2026 it is. It\u2019s literally the most personal thing ever.</p> <h2>World\u2019s Worst</h2> <p>This time, the girls are starring in a show called \u201cWorld\u2019s Worst\u201d where they\u2019ll play wannabe performers with big dreams, outrageous backstories, and no talent whatsoever. So it\u2019s based on season 10 then. THE SHADE.</p> <p>Already Brita and Sherry are arrogantly talking over team leader Aiden Zhane because they know about acting daahling. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure about the leader of the group,\u201d says Sherry. Well, we\u2019re not sure why we still have to watch Sherry given the repulsive revelations about her, but here we are.</p> <p>In terms of the actual end product \u2013 as with most of these Drag Race TV show parodies, it\u2019s mostly inane and unfunny. It also goes on for way too long, taking up almost half of the episode\u2019s running time. The only good thing about it is guest judge Charo, who\u2019s had more wiglets than you\u2019ve had hot dinners.</p> <h2>Workroom</h2> <p>Back in the workroom and we\u2019re onto some interesting chat from Dalia about her and her gay identical twin brother, and how they navigated coming out to their parents, including debating whether to do it together or separately. It\u2019s in situations like this where Drag Race really comes into its own, giving airtime to unique stories. But apparently the twin also wants to start doing drag \u2026 UH-OH.</p> <p>Heidi is wearing a Pinocchio nose. We don\u2019t know why but we can\u2019t wait to find out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WorldOfWonder/status/1238635737588871168\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Category is\u2026 Buttons and Bows! \ud83c\udf80  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeidiNCloset?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@heidincloset</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DragRace?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DragRace</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/qOsSBgnFlN\">pic.twitter.com/qOsSBgnFlN</a></p>&mdash; World of Wonder (@WorldOfWonder) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WorldOfWonder/status/1238635737588871168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 14, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>Sissy that walk</h2> <p>RuPaul arrives in a brave silhouette for her, a departure from her usual ballgown fare \u2013 she of course pulls it off though. The whole gang\u2019s here \u2013 Carson, Michelle and, alas, Ross Matthews. We\u2019re also joined by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Munn\">Olivia\u2019s Mum</a>. Who\u2019s Olivia? And why is her mum on TV?</p> <p>The runway category is \u201cButtons &amp; Bows\u201d. At this point the production team might as well just be throwing those little word magnets at the fridge in the staffroom and seeing what sticks. Olives &amp; Ships! Farmyard Car Crash! San Moritz Space Exploration!</p> <p>Jan\u2019s look is incredible, Heidi\u2019s is EXACTLY as ridiculous as we thought it\u2019d be and Gigi\u2019s is genius \u2013 a suit of 25,000 orange buttons. \u201cThis is the heaviest thing I\u2019ve ever worn,\u201d she says. Once you\u2019ve said something as fabulous as that, you\u2019ll know you\u2019ve made it in life.</p> <p>In possibly the most hilarious piece of dialogue in any show ever, Michelle says to Dahlia, with a perfectly straight face; \u201cI know it\u2019s hard to be a piece of broccoli when you\u2019re trying to be beautiful.\u201d AND THE EMMY GOES TO \u2026</p> <h2>Lipsync for your LIFE</h2> <p>It\u2019s lipsync time and the wrong people are in the bottom two. The song is Iggy Azalea and Ariana Grande\u2019s \u201cProblem\u201d. A pre-drink fave. Carson\u2019s dad dancing is hilarious. Nicky\u2019s staying and Dahlia\u2019s going. The whole thing is a colossal anticlimax.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/chrixxstian/status/1238648592606195713\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">dahlia sin walking out petty on rpdr is me walking anywhere \ud83d\ude2d <a href=\"https://t.co/DghzqC0erW\">pic.twitter.com/DghzqC0erW</a></p>&mdash; christian (@chrixxstian) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrixxstian/status/1238648592606195713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 14, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>Notes and observations</h2> <p><strong>Shadiest moment</strong><em> </em>Sherry and Brita picking on Aiden left a sour taste and felt dangerously close to bullying.

This has long been an issue with Drag Race, to the point where it\u2019s actually lost long-time fans over some of RuPaul\u2019s decisions. But to be fair \u2026 it\u2019s called RUPAUL\u2019S Drag Race, so, like it or not, the final decision is hers to make.</p> <p>So, what do you think Heidi N Closet should change her name to? Heidi Ho? Heidi Ng The Salami? Heidi From Covid-19?</p>"
