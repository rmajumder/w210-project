The decision by the Russian watchdog could affect hundreds of ventilators that have been produced since April as Russian hospitals sought new supplies to prepare for a flood of coronavirus cases. </p> \n  <p>Five coronavirus patients, some reportedly attached to ventilators, died in the early hours of Tuesday after a fire broke out at the St George hospital in St Petersburg. A fire last week at a Moscow hospital treating coronavirus patients also killed one person. That fire may also have been tied to a faulty ventilator. Both hospitals were reportedly using Aventa-M ventilators produced by a state-run factory in Russia\u2019s Urals region. </p> \n  <p>An April tender showed that last month the St George hospital had ordered 237 ventilators from the factory, which is the only manufacturer of that ventilator in the country. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebbbe068f08d99d46a15f24\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/emmanuel-akinwotu\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T09:34:56.619Z\">10.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The continuing ban on public and religious gatherings in Nigeria has led to increasingly divided reactions from Churches in Nigeria. </p> \n  <p>In recent weeks, two of the most influential mega-church pastors in the country have grown in hostility to the government\u2019s lockdown measures, and questioned the severity of the pandemic altogether.</p> \n  <p>Bishop David Oyedepo, the founder of Living Faith Tabernacle has been among the most ardent critics of the ban on places of worship. Its main branch on the outskirts of Lagos draws 50,000 people. Earlier this week Oyedepo said the closure of churches while hospitals and markets were open amounted to a conspiracy against Churches. <br><br>\u201cThere is something wrong; for people to be allowed to be in the market for six hours and can\u2019t be in church for two hours. I can smell a rat,\u201d he said this week. \u201cThe voice of darkness is influencing people at various levels, targeting the church because the growth and expansion of the church is the greatest headache of the devil. I declare churches open.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Pastor Chris Oyakhilome\u2019s Christ Embassy is spread around the world with a main branch in Lagos seating 30,000 people. The pastor has been a consistent critic of measures to tackle the pandemic. \u201cThe lockdown is not science,\u201d he said in a sermon on Tuesday. The wearing of facemasks in public was \u201can embarrassment to science\u201d, he added. He has also previously linked Covid-19 to 5G mobile phone networks, fuelling a conspiracy theory that has spread around the world.</p> \n  <p>Both church leaders have faced criticism for their comments, not least from fellow church pastors. Pastor Tunde Bakare, the head of The Citadel Global Community Church, where the main hall in Lagos seats 5,000, this week donated two church buildings and a private residence to Nigerian states for isolation centres. </p> \n  <p>\u201cChurches with multiple facilities, rather than their leaders criticising the government should collaborate with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must be prepared to offer some of their halls to the government as isolation centres, in support of the efforts of the government.\u201d<br><br>In a further boost to Nigeria\u2019s Covid-19 response, the Catholic Church in Nigeria this week donated all of its 425 medical facilities across the country to the government to serve as isolation and treatment centres. Nigeria\u2019s predominantly deeply religious population is evenly split between Christians and Muslims according to government surveys. </p> \n  <p>The effect of the lockdown on religious life has been immense. Yet many Nigerian Christians are increasingly calling on the country\u2019s mega churches to donate their now empty auditoriums as the country rushes to build its health capacity. New infections of Covid-19 in Nigeria are growing, now at 4,787, doubling in the last 12 days. 158 people have lost their lives and 959 people have recovered. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebbba898f08d99d46a15ef8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T09:15:35.176Z\">10.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Reuters have filed this update from Poland:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Poland will extend its strict border controls until 12 June due to the coronavirus pandemic, its Interior Ministry said on Wednesday.</p> \n   <p>Poland closed its borders to foreigners in March to stop the spread of the coronavirus and has extended the restriction four times since then.

Call it the Screen New Deal. Far more hi-tech than anything we have seen during previous disasters, the future that is being rushed into being as the bodies still pile up treats our past weeks of physical isolation not as a painful necessity to save lives, but as a living laboratory for a permanent \u2013 and highly profitable \u2013 no-touch future.</p> \n  <p>This is a future in which, for the privileged, almost everything is home delivered, either virtually via streaming and cloud technology, or physically via driverless vehicle or drone, then screen \u201cshared\u201d on a mediated platform. It\u2019s a future that employs far fewer teachers, doctors and drivers. It accepts no cash or credit cards (under guise of virus control), and has skeletal mass transit and far less live art. It\u2019s a future that claims to be run on \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d, but is actually held together by tens of millions of anonymous workers tucked away in warehouses, data centres, content-moderation mills, electronic sweatshops, lithium mines, industrial farms, meat-processing plants and prisons, where they are left unprotected from disease and hyper-exploitation. It\u2019s a future in which our every move, our every word, our every relationship is trackable, traceable and data-mineable by unprecedented collaborations between government and tech giants.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/may/13/naomi-klein-how-big-tech-plans-to-profit-from-coronavirus-pandemic\">Naomi Klein: How big tech plans to profit from the pandemic</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb75ce8f08a55ecde58e3c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T05:00:58.509Z\">6.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Nature is healing in San Jose, California: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan/status/1260410385452187649\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">oh my goat <a href=\"https://t.co/bvcaMIAHgz\">https://t.co/bvcaMIAHgz</a></p>\u2014 Helen Sullivan (@helenrsullivan) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan/status/1260410385452187649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb7d148f08a55ecde58e5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T04:54:56.152Z\">5.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Thailand has recorded zero new coronavirus cases for the first time since 9 March, Rueters reports. </p> \n  <p>Thailand has 3,017 confirmed cases and<strong> </strong>56 deaths, according to <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University</a> data. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a27ed82876dc5e0d74d4027305f041ef8a0eb5a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a27ed82876dc5e0d74d4027305f041ef8a0eb5a/0_237_5296_3176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street food sellers stand behind plastic divider sheet in Bangkok, Thailand, Wednesday, 13 May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street food sellers stand behind plastic divider sheet in Bangkok, Thailand, Wednesday, 13 May 2020.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gemunu Amarasinghe/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb76a68f08d99d46a15d56\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T04:45:47.425Z\">5.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Confirmed deaths worldwide pass 290,000. </strong>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 4,261,955 people around the world are known to have contracted the virus, while at least 291,964 have died since the pandemic began.<strong> </strong>The numbers, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing recording and testing regimes.</li> \n   <li><strong>More than 147,000 Americans could die by early August \u2013 study. </strong>A newly revised coronavirus mortality model predicts more than 147,000 Americans will die from Covid-19 by early August, up nearly 10,000 from the last projection, as restrictions for curbing the pandemic are increasingly relaxed, researchers said on Tuesday. The current US death toll stands at 82,376.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil reports record deaths. </strong>Brazil reported a record <a href=\"https://covid.saude.gov.br/\">881 Covid-19</a> deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday, its health ministry said, taking its total to 12,400 and making it the world\u2019s sixth worst-affected country in terms of deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">figures</a>. Its total of 177,589 confirmed cases is the world\u2019s seventh-highest.</li> \n   <li><strong>US Senate threatens sanctions on China over Covid-19 accounting. </strong>US Republican senators proposed legislation Tuesday that would empower President Donald Trump to slap sanctions on China if Beijing does not give a \u201cfull accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak. The legislation will give Trump 60 days to certify to Congress that China has provided a full accounting on the Covid-19 outbreak to an investigation that could be led by the United States and its allies, or a United Nations body like the World Health Organization.</li> \n   <li><strong>Wuhan prepares to test 11 million residents. </strong>The Chinese city of Wuhan, the original centre of the pandemic, plans to test all 11 million residents for coronavirus, according to local media. It was widely believed that this will be done within 10 days. However, Chinese media reports have given some more clarity today, suggesting that while there is a citywide testing plan, the time limit is for each region on staggered start times.</li> \n   <li><strong>Twitter announces employees will be allowed to work from home \u2018forever\u2019. </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/12/twitter-coronavirus-covid19-work-from-home\">Twitter will allow its employees to work from home \u201cforever\u201d</a>, chief executive officer Jack Dorsey said in a company-wide email Tuesday.

accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak, AFP reports. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe Chinese Communist Party must be held accountable for the detrimental role they played in this pandemic,\u201d said Senator Jim Inhofe, one of the sponsors of the \u201cCovid-19 Accountability Act.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cTheir outright deception of the origin and spread of the virus cost the world valuable time and lives as it began to spread,\u201d he said in a statement.</p> \n  <p>The legislation will give Trump 60 days to certify to Congress that China has provided a full accounting on the Covid-19 outbreak to an investigation that could be led by the United States and its allies, or a United Nations body like the World Health Organization.</p> \n  <p>Trump must also certify that China has closed its highest-risk wet markets and released Hong Kong activists arrested in post-Covid-19 crackdowns.</p> \n  <p>Without certification, Trump would be authorised under the legislation to impose sanctions like asset freezes, travel bans and visa revocations, as well as restricting Chinese businesses\u2019 access to US bank financing and capital markets.</p> \n  <p>\u201cChina refuses to allow the international community to go into the Wuhan lab to investigate,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, another sponsor of the bill.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey refuse to allow investigators to study how this

  "<p><strong>What inspired the stories that we hear in six barber shops across two continents in the play?<br></strong>I was dating someone who was an epidemiologist and she talked to me about a counselling project for barbers, to teach them ways of spotting mental health issues while they were cutting hair. The organisation she was involved with wanted to offer mental health advice there and then, and there were no other black mental health projects out there.</p> \n<p>This was a way of exploring the issues in a safe space and barber shops, for British black men, are a safe, sacred place where they can go to relax, escape racism and talk freely with no fear of being stopped, questioned or moved on by the police, which is a common experience in the world outside. In looking across six countries, I wanted to explore and showcase the multiplicities of African masculinities, although I was only looking at anglophone Africa, not Africa in its entirety.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/26/barber-shop-chronicles-review-roundhouse-inua-ellams\">Barber Shop Chronicles review \u2013 hair-raising ebullience</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>What did your research involve?<br></strong>I began it in 2009 \u2013 all my projects take a long time, with a lot of pruning and fine tuning! I travelled to each of the six cities that the play is set in [Lagos, Accra, Kampala, Johannesburg and Harare as well as the south London barber in Peckham] and I stayed for one week in each one. I arrived in South Africa the week Nelson Mandela died [in December 2013]. In each country I met the men who then became characters in the play. Sometimes I cleaned up their words or merged aspects of them with others but the characters are all versions of the men I met.</p> \n<p>I actually spoke to one of them just last week. He lives in Johannesburg and I used his words verbatim in the play and also named a character after him. He has never seen the play before but will be able to do so when it is streamed online.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86f17a0f89128ac4e74d8e03cc8406618a70867a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86f17a0f89128ac4e74d8e03cc8406618a70867a/0_0_4193_2979/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cyril Nri and Anthony Welsh in Barber Shop Chronicles at the National Theatre in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"710\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyril Nri and Anthony Welsh in Barber Shop Chronicles at the National Theatre in 2017.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>The cast is made up of 12 male actors who play 30 characters and it is clear that the play is focusing on all-male worlds. Did you consider adding female characters at any point?<br></strong>We had conversations about this early on and I felt that any female character in the play would have been tokenistic by being on stage for a small morsel of time. I was also working on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/11/three-sisters-review-inua-ellams-chekhov-lyttelton-theatre-london\">Three Sisters</a> at the time, which centres on a powerful trio of female characters and I didn\u2019t feel it necessary to just shoe-horn in a female character for the sake of it.</p> \n<p><strong>There is a lot of music and dance in the play, especially in transitions between scenes, and it seems central to the overall drama. How important was it for you and did you cite particular songs in your script or leave it to the show\u2019s music composer?<br></strong>I listed some of the songs in the script but Michael Henry, the composer, chose them too as well as the director, Bijan Sheibani, staff director, Stella Odunlami, and members of the cast. No one stayed in their lanes; it was a collaborative process. I also included song and dance because I know that this is the director\u2019s language in creating theatre \u2013 there is lots of movement in his work.

Is it different for men?<br></strong>Black men still suffer from this but hair politics is not as problematic for men as it is for women. So if you have dreadlocks in the wrong part of the world you can be killed for it, and there are economic stereotypes read into our hair, too. But women are dealt a far harder hand and they also have to contend with problematic beauty standards, which is a far more difficult thing.</p> \n<p><strong>What was the idea behind inviting the audience on </strong><strong>stage beforehand for a haircut and did a lot of people take up the offer?<br></strong>We weren\u2019t giving real haircuts but we did have a trained barber who taught the cast all the basics of how to cut hair. On stage, the actors are miming the cutting of hair, although in one incident, an actor was miming in this way and he accidentally chopped a chunk of hair off, which got heated.</p> \n<p>What we were trying to do was to democratise the space, welcome people on stage and in the process, to get rid of the fourth wall that separates the audience from the actors. These barber shops are sacred spaces and the black men in the audiences came knowing that. We wanted to say, \u201cThis is your space, these are your stories\u201d, and it was important to invite them on to the stage for that reason, especially in a place like the National Theatre.</p> \n<p>But I also wanted to welcome non-black, non-male audience members in the same way so they wouldn\u2019t feel like they were eavesdropping into the world of the drama. I wanted to say, \u201cYou are <em>all</em> welcome\u201d and even if the barrier between the stage and the auditorium still exists, it isn\u2019t as stringent and enforced here as it is in some theatre spaces.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c9009b6d-ae96-4160-b5f4-817a73e18fd9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lSy73_dPKbA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>How does being a poet affect your job as a playwright?<br></strong>I\u2019m definitely more observant of language and arrested by imagery, by the power of the lone voice, by the sonics of storytelling and how much they can command an audience.

  "<h2><strong>1. What is the furlough scheme?</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s officially called the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\">launched in March</a> . It allows employers to stand down workers but then claim a cash grant of up to 80% of their wages, capped at \u00a32,500 a month. The money is claimed by the company and distributed to staff, so individuals don\u2019t have to do anything themselves. Some employers decide to make up the 20% difference, some do not.</p> <h2><strong>2. How many people are on the scheme?</strong></h2> <p>Huge numbers \u2013 the government revealed on Tuesday that the scheme is currently paying out to around 7.5 million employees, a quarter of Britain\u2019s private sector workforce. It has been used by 935,000 companies.</p> <h2><strong>3. How is it changing?</strong></h2> <p>It is being extended for another four months, to the end of October 2020 but with a number of changes. Crucially the 80% rate is being retained, squashing concerns that Chancellor Rishi Sunak would cut the government contribution to 60%.</p> <p>The big change, which will come into force from the start of August, is that workers will be able to return to their jobs part-time. At the moment companies must choose between putting staff into complete furlough, where they do not work at all, or keep them on full pay. From August furloughed workers will be able to return to work part-time with employers being asked to pay towards the salaries of their furloughed staff.</p> <p>The government said it is also exploring ways in which people can do additional training or learn new skills while they are furloughed and their employer is receiving money from the government.</p> <h2><strong>4. What does it mean for employers?</strong></h2> <p>The 80% pay level will remain, but companies will have to start contributing for staff that return part-time. There are currently no details of what companies will be asked to pay, but it could be that employers have to pay 20% of their furloughed employees\u2019 salaries, while the government pays the remaining 60%.</p> <p>The chancellor said: \u201cWe will ask employers to start sharing with the government the cost of paying salaries.\u201d</p> <p>In its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-extends-furlough-scheme-until-october\">official advice</a>, the Treasury said: \u201cThe employer payments will substitute the contribution the government is currently making, ensuring that staff continue to receive 80% of their salary, up to \u00a32,500 a month.\u201d</p> <p>Employer groups welcomed the deal, but said they needed more details. Mike Cherry, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \u201cWe await further detail on the contributions that will be required of small employers after July. We need to ensure that those obligations are affordable for the many businesses that have had no revenue coming in for months now, but still have fixed overheads to worry about.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>5. What does it mean for workers?</strong></h2> <p>This deal paves the way for workers to begin a partial return to employment and probably means that employers will be less likely to make them permanently unemployed in the coming weeks. But it is still another 10 weeks before the part-time scheme begins and in the meantime some employers may still decide to make deep redundancies. In that case, the employee will have to apply for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/11/universal-credit-how-claim-coronavirus-lay-offs-benefits\">universal credit.</a></p> <h2><strong>6. I\u2019m self-employed. Am I being offered anything?</strong></h2> <p>The government said there will be no changes to the scheme until July. It is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-support-package-for-uk-self-employed-how-does-it-work\">currently offering </a>self-employed people a taxable grant based on their previous monthly earnings over the last three years, worth up to 80% of earnings and capped at \u00a32,500 a month. To be eligible, you must have annual \u201cprofits\u201d (self-employed earnings) of less than \u00a350,000 a year, according to HMRC.</p> <p>The scheme has been criticised for leaving some groups of the self-employed without a safety net. </p> <h2><strong>7. How much will it cost?</strong></h2> <p>The Institute of Fiscal Studies estimates the likely cost over the whole of the period from March to July will be around \u00a360bn \u2013 or \u00a312bn a month.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/12/how-the-uk-furlough-scheme-compares-with-other-countries\">8. How does the scheme compare with those available in other countries?</a></strong></h2> <p>The German scheme, called <em>Kurzarbeit</em>, is expected to cost at least \u20ac40bn. It currently covers 10 million workers and is among the most generous, paying up to 67% of net wages lost due to shorter hours, to a maximum of \u20ac6,700 per month for employees with children, and 60% for those without children. Unlike the British scheme, German firms can allow staff to work part-time, reducing the cost.</p> <p>In France, more than 12 million are covered by a scheme called <em>Chimage Partial</em> which has cost \u20ac26bn so far. It offers 70% of salary on up to \u20ac6,927 gross per month. Employees on minimum wage (SMIC) receive 100% . As with the German scheme, firms can claim just part of a worker\u2019s salary and many do, limiting the cost to the finance ministry.</p> <p>Ireland\u2019s Temporary Wage subsidy scheme is providing support for 450,000 workers. Since 4 May the scheme has become more generous, paying an 85% subsidy up to \u20ac21,400. Like the UK scheme it compels claimants to stay at home and not work, but the Irish government has signalled that will be changed.</p>",
  "<p>Last week, the Office for National Statistics confirmed what many had suspected since the start of this pandemic \u2013 black, Asian and minority ethnic people are far more likely to get and die from coronavirus. But it is the scale of difference that is so worrying. Black people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\">more than four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than white people</a>.

It can\u2019t come soon enough: among frontline NHS and social care workers, the difference is all too stark: despite accounting for just <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/nhs-workforce/latest\">20%</a> of the workforce, rising to 44% among medics, <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/exclusive-deaths-of-nhs-staff-from-covid-19-analysed/7027471.article\">94% of doctors and </a><a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/exclusive-deaths-of-nhs-staff-from-covid-19-analysed/7027471.article\">71% of nurses</a> who have died from Covid-19 were black, Asian and minority ethnic.

Health workers caught flu during both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/nurses-fell-like-ninepins-death-and-bravery-in-the-1918-flu-pandemic\">1918</a> and <a href=\"https://bjgp.org/content/59/565/622\">1957</a> and 1968 flu pandemics. And while an ethnic breakdown of the data is not available, some of the casualties of the 1957 and 1968 epidemics will have been black, Asian or from ethnic minorities. It is even possible some BAME nurses working in the UK died in the 1918 epidemic. We just don\u2019t know. But nurses from BAME backgrounds have been working in the NHS for generations. Although many were part of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2018/apr/17/who-are-the-windrush-generation-video-explainer\">Windrush generation</a>, coming from the Caribbean to the UK from 1948 to 1971 to work in the newly established NHS, they were not the first arrivals.<br><br>By 1954, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Many-rivers-cross-Caribbean-1948-69/dp/0113227213\">more than 3,000 Caribbean women</a> were training in British hospitals. By 1959, official statistics showed 6,365 nursing students in Britain who had come here from overseas. By 1966-67 the total number of nurses and midwives from overseas who trained here had risen to 16,745. </p> <p>Research (<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/historysocialaction/esther-bruce\">Aunt Esther</a>)<strong> </strong>by social historian Stephen Bourne has revealed that black nurses worked in the healthcare system long before the NHS was even thought of. Most would have been from within the British empire, including the Caribbean, India and countries in Africa.</p> <p> Bourne believes that their experiences were far less negative than current thinking might have us believe. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t stereotype black nurses\u2019 experiences, nor victimise the nurses who came as part of the Windrush generation,\u201d says Bourne. </p> <p>\u201cWe know that black nurses from Britain\u2019s former colonies, including the Windrush generation, began to arrive in Britain soon after the founding of the NHS. However, the back story of the nurses who came here before 1948 is not known.</p> <p>\u201cAs far as I am aware, none left any testimonies, so we do not know their point of view. They would have confronted some racist attitudes, but they would also have been loved and respected by their contemporaries in the medical profession, and their patients.\u201d</p> <p> Most will have at least heard of the Jamaican nurse <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Seacole\">Mary Seacole</a>, a contemporary of Florence Nightingale, who also nursed troops in the Crimean war. Other, less well-known black nurses include <a href=\"https://eastendwomensmuseum.org/blog/annie-brewster-the-london-hospitals-nurse-ophthalmic\">Annie Brewster</a> , a nurse originally from St Vincent , who moved to London as a child in the 1860s, worked at the London hospital in Whitechapel from 1881 for 20 years and died in 1902, aged 42.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f3d573781ac5aca46b9b1f067e3b7f5a8f1e0496\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3d573781ac5aca46b9b1f067e3b7f5a8f1e0496/0_0_755_1184/638.jpg\" alt=\"Annie Brewster, who came from St Vincent to London in the 1860s and worked at the London hospital in Whitechapel\" width=\"638\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Annie Brewster, who came from St Vincent to London in the 1860s and worked at the London hospital in Whitechapel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brewster worked with elderly patients who were losing their sight. \u201cBrewster was much loved,\u201d says Bourne. </p> <p>Fast forward to the early 1930s, when <a href=\"https://www.rcn.org.uk/library-exhibitions/wake-up-slackers\">Eva Lowe </a><strong> </strong>came to the UK from Jamaica looking for work. She eventually trained at St Nicholas\u2019 hospital in Plumstead, south London, from 1932, registering with the Royal College of Nursing as a qualified nurse in 1935.</p> <p>But it was a difficult time for any black nurse to gain employment in the pre-NHS healthcare system. Before working at St Nicholas, Lowe had applied to 28 hospitals. All rejected her.</p> <p>One hospital said they had to consider the feelings of the patients; another that she would have difficulty being accepted by other nurses, some of whom were daughters of army officers.</p> <p>According to the Royal College of Nursing, there are many other stories, as yet untold, of women who trained here and were admitted to the nursing register before the 1930s. No one knows who they were, as the nurse\u2019s ethnicity was not recorded on the register. However, it is known that hospitals in London and Birmingham admitted black nurses for training before that time.</p> <p>Today, <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/nursingmidwifery/delivering-the-nhs-ltp/cno-black-and-minority-%20%20ethnic-bme-leadership/\">one in every five nurses and midwives are from BAME backgrounds</a>, rising to much higher levels (up to 40%) in some regions and parts of the country, such as London.</p> <p>\u201cBlack nurses in Britain entering the profession today have more role models than I did,\u201d says Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, who trained in the 1980s. \u201cThere are far more visible black leaders in health and social care now. But even now, there aren\u2019t nearly enough.</p> <p>\u201cIf the stories of these nurses who made great strides in the early days of modern nursing had been more well known, it may have brought comfort to black nurses who faced prejudice and discrimination, and maybe even stopped some leaving the profession altogether.\u201d</p> <p>Some black women who nursed in the UK before the NHS started had more positive experiences. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Tsehai\">Princess Tsehai</a>, the daughter of the exiled Ethiopian king Haile Selassie, trained at Great Ormond Street hospital in London, qualifying as a nurse in 1939, before returning home in 1941 to work there.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a real surprise to find out about her,\u201d says Karen Bonner, a senior nurse and trustee of the Mary Seacole Trust. \u201cThe idea of her training here but going back to her own country, I found really impressive.\u201d</p> <p>Princess Tsehai died in childbirth in 1942, a year after returning home, so never had the chance to pass on her knowledge. But in 1946 Selassie set up a hospital and nursing school in Addis Ababa in her name.</p> <p>In 1938, another African royal, <a href=\"https://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/articles/10-things-you-didn-t-know-about-britain-s-black-community-during-the-world-wars/\">Princess Ademola</a>, daughter of the chief of northern Nigeria, trained at Guy\u2019s hospital, becoming a state registered nurse (SRN). \u201cEveryone was very kind to me,\u201d she told newspaper journalists at the time.
