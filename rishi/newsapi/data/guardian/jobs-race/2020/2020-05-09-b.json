This includes what\u2019s known as \u201c<a href=\"https://foodfirst.org/what-is-parity-and-why-you-should-care/\">parity</a>\u201d \u2013 a fair price for farmers\u2019 crops, guaranteed by the government, to prevent overproduction and market chaos.</p> \n   <p>Subsidies that currently <a href=\"https://ips-dc.org/we-subsidize-the-wrong-kind-of-agriculture/\">propel</a> farming consolidation and mass production of commodities for livestock feed and fuel must be reformed to promote organic, smaller-scale, regionally and local foods. This will help farmers survive and provide communities with resilient and diverse food supplies rather than depending on vast and fragile corporate food supply chains.</p> \n   <p>If there were ever a time to bust up the food and farming monopolies, which are reminiscent of the Beef Trust of the early 1900s, now is it. Centralized corporate power is creating agricultural and economic mono-cropping at a time when we most need a food system that\u2019s diverse, equitable and sustainable.</p> \n   <p>The Covid-19 crisis and worsening climate chaos require far more public-sector direction and coordination of something as central to human survival as food.</p> \n   <p>Amid the current supply-chain breakdown, as news spread of gargantuan food waste, some <a href=\"https://www.wkbw.com/news/state-news/new-york-state-farmers-donate-34-000-pounds-of-milk-beef-and-produce-to-nyc-families-in-need?fbclid=IwAR0L4qkyEIvINGqaGblka5BiOrPTgo-nazaGBJYCfFNmFZ_Zc2NMqz81txU\">farmers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.king5.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/caravan-brings-thousands-of-pound-to-produce-to-western-washington-for-families-in-need/281-1eae725e-6923-4bcc-b7e2-ffb86f4ad56b?fbclid=IwAR2jloI75BLLJRtGwr2uRvLSTU4PlszVTxfkitpzxyheVfiS-euVBTKVfLA\">caravans</a> of volunteers have helped deliver food directly from the farms to people in need \u2013 a truly heroic gift.</p> \n   <p>But this vital act, feeding people in need and averting massive food waste, can\u2019t be left to random acts of kindness.

  "<p><strong>Nightwaves Radio</strong> <a href=\"https://t.co/2JgRuJ9wq1?amp=1\">nightwaves.radio</a><br><strong>No Signal: 10 v</strong><strong> 10</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theresnosignal.com/\">theresnosignal.com</a><br><strong>Race and Covid-19</strong> BBC Local Radio | <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08c9gzm\">BBC Sounds</a><br><br>Much is written \u2013 often by me \u2013 about the intimate connection between podcasts and their listeners, but radio shows have that too. Plus radio is live: an exciting quality in a time when living on the edge means shuffling your bum forward a little on the sofa. \u201cEveryone\u2019s making a podcast,\u201d observed Gemma Cairney, early in her first live internet radio show, <strong><a href=\"https://nightwaves.radio/\">Nightwaves Radio</a></strong>, which made its debut broadcast on Wednesday evening, \u201cbut I\u2019m very, very passionate about creating something live during lockdown.\u201d</p> <p>Cairney, an audio veteran who\u2019s presented for BBC Radio 1 Xtra, Radio 4 and 6 Music, was trying to do a non-podcast: a live show, with her producer working remotely, that played great music, offered lovely interviews and had listeners call in to chat. Just a normal radio programme, really: but tricky technically, without hordes of tech-heads in the same room as the microphone, internet server, mobile phone and host.</p> <p>Partly, Cairney\u2019s motivation was to ease lockdown loneliness. \u201cI\u2019m desperate to pour out my love for music and art and people,\u201d she said. Partly, it was to create sonic inventiveness (the producer, <a href=\"https://buddypeace.bandcamp.com/\">Buddy Peace</a>, works with musician and podcaster Scroobius Pip). A lot of ambition for a small show, and the first few minutes were shaky \u2013 Cairney has a lot of friends and too many people were trying to listen for her technical setup to cope, you suspect \u2013 but things settled down.</p> <p>Exemplary music choices helped (Marvin Gaye, J Dilla, Gil Scott-Heron). Cairney herself was a little scattered, but better when talking to others, especially the wonderful Bob Harris about his pirate radio years. Perhaps one question or theme per show would focus energies, and give everyone something to talk about other than the weirdness of social isolation: <em>Nightwaves Radio</em> is an experiment that could grow into something wonderful.</p> <p>Another, very different, live internet radio show has exploded over the past few weeks. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theresnosignal.com/listen\">No Signal\u2019s 10 v</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theresnosignal.com/listen\"> 10</a></strong> shows are a massive worldwide success, with over a million listening to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eaey4u0E8Uk\">Vybz Kartel v</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eaey4u0E8Uk\"> Wizkid</a> last weekend, on YouTube and on No Signal\u2019s website; plus equally enormous numbers for its three shows this week. <em>10 v</em><em> 10</em> is a soundclash show. Two artists\u2019 tunes are put up directly against each other, track by track. Each artist has a champion, who chooses the tracks and gives out a bit of banter and argy about it. There\u2019s a host, who keeps things moving, and listeners react online. Doesn\u2019t sound like much? Honestly, these shows are such a buzz. When 10 v 10 goes out live, Twitter goes bananas (Burnaboy and his mum went live on Instagram in support of WizKid, who won 10-0, causing much emotion). Tens of thousands of listeners vote on each track-clash: madly impressive, given they only have 10 minutes to vote. On Monday it was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vokq8IVLNK8\">Chris Brown v</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vokq8IVLNK8\"> Usher </a>(Usher won 6-4; on Wednesday, WSTRN v N-Dubz (N-Dubz won 6-4).</p> <p>Spotify has started putting up the tracklists from the shows, but the real buzz is from listening as they go out. <em>10 v</em><em> 10</em> has the blow-your-head-off hit of live sport, the who-will-win excitement of a TV game show final, the Twitter jokes-rush of both \u2013 but with brilliant music, so it\u2019s even better.</p> <p>More liveness. On Wednesday, BBC local radio stations came together for an important hour-long show, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08c9gzm\">Race and Covid-19</a>, which discussed why BAME people have been more deeply affected by the coronavirus. Hosted by Karen Gabay in Manchester, Summaya Mughal in Leicester and Dotun Adebayo in London, this was a vital listen. Medics and experts came on to explain the various, interlocking reasons why people from minority ethic groups have suffered so much more, and relevant points were made regarding work, housing, culture, religion and language. It was left to the callers to bring up racism directly. Vinnie from Liverpool talked about being \u201csecond-best\u201d in the UK; Tamil, a junior doctor from London, said \u201cit comes down to racism and discrimination\u201d. Public Health England is conducting a governmental review into \u201cwhat role ethnicity has played in this pandemic\u201d, but no spokesperson would come on the show. Too live, perhaps. Catch up <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08c9gzm\">on BBC Sounds</a>.</p> <h2>Three shows doing lockdown well</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://planetradio.co.uk/podcasts/frank-skinner-poetry-podcast/\">Frank Skinner\u2019s Poetry Podcast</a><br></strong>Yes, you did read that right. Frank Skinner, comedian and host of Absolute Radio\u2019s Saturday morning show, has a new poetry podcast. This might seem a new direction for a man once known for his promotion of football and porn, but Skinner is a poetry enthusiast. Each week, he takes one or two poems and talks about them, with insight and delight. The most recent, <a href=\"https://planetradio.co.uk/podcasts/frank-skinner-poetry-podcast/listen/2029214/\">about Donna Stonecipher\u2019s 2015 poem </a><a href=\"https://planetradio.co.uk/podcasts/frank-skinner-poetry-podcast/listen/2029214/\">Model City</a>, has him in raptures (\u201cmeaning is only part of the deal\u201d) and his joy is catching. I would shave 10 minutes off each show, but otherwise these are perfect.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/m0005fdz\">Elis James and John Robins: The Isolation Tapes</a> <br></strong>The 5 Live presenters stay apart together with a funny show about\u2026 well, all the stuff that\u2019s caused by these strange times. Whether kicking a ball with your daughter is allowed or not. How having a big cry is OK. Though there are guests, the listening pleasure is all in their gentle geniality (along with that of producers Dave Masterman, and sometimes Jess Temby), and the celebration of each other\u2019s foibles. Robins has many, including being obsessed with Queen (the band), and bringing accountancy folders to stay with his girlfriend, just in case. Hilarious and sweet.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://kathbum.podbean.com/\">Katherine Ryan: Telling Everybody</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://kathbum.podbean.com/\"> Everything</a><br></strong>This show started strongly a month ago, with comedian Ryan talking about her miscarriage, and has been in the iTunes Top 10 every since. Ryan is acerbic and honest, straightforward and relevant \u2013 the show is recorded every week, with her quick-witted reaction to what\u2019s happened to her, whether major (pregnancy loss), middling (watching <em>The Last Dance</em>, making TikToks) or minor (reacting to odd people on social media). Her Canadian accent isn\u2019t soothing, but abrasive. And some of us enjoy that.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 and 13 May 2020 to correct the name of Katherine Ryan\u2019s podcast and a reference to her \u201cAmerican accent\u201d. She is Canadian.</p>",
  "<p>In two, terrible, months the coronavirus pandemic has driven unemployment in the US to levels unseen since the 1930s Great Depression. Did it have to be this way?</p> <p>Covid-19 has cost more than 33 million Americans their jobs in the last seven weeks \u2013 10% of the entire US population. The official unemployment rate had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/08/april-jobs-report-us-unemployment-rate\">shot up</a> from 4.4% to 14.7% on Friday \u2013 a figure that probably wildly underestimates the true scale of job losses.</p> <p>Across the Atlantic in Europe unemployment rates, while rising sharply, have yet to match the devastating rises experienced in the US. The UK is facing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/uk-economy-to-shrink-by-25-percent-and-unemployment-to-double-warns-bank-of-england-coronavirus\">9%-plus </a>unemployment. In Germany the International Monetary Fund is <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/28/german-employment-ifo-survey-plummets-to-record-low-as-coronavirus-hits.html\">predicting </a>an unemployment rate of just 3.9% for 2020, up from 3.2% last year.</p> <p>The stark differences can in part be explained by a German word: \u201c<em>Kurzarbeit</em>.\u201d And two \u2013 largely \u2013 opposing views on the best way to recover from this unprecedented lockdown and the tsunami of job losses that have followed.</p> <p>Kurzarbeit \u2013 literally \u201cshort work\u201d \u2013 allows businesses facing a temporary emergency to apply for government subsidies to keep paying workers\u2019 salaries until the crisis passes.</p> <p>\u201cKeeping people connected to their employers is a good idea,\u201d said Simon Johnson, professor of entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of Management and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Retaining skilled workers and maintaining households in crisis, in principle, should allow people, companies and countries to bounce back faster once the crisis passes, he said.</p> <p>Many European counties, including the UK, Italy and the Netherlands, have adapted versions of the model for the current crisis after witnessing Germany\u2019s speedy recovery from the last recession. \u201cThe people who are closest to Germany actually seem to have got this, those that are further have struggled to understand it,\u201d he said. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nor has the US\u2019s unemployment program been without problems. Many state systems have collapsed under the weight of applications</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The US, instead, is largely relying on its unemployment insurance program to deal with the crisis. After much political infighting Congress agreed to boost state benefits by $600 a week until the summer. The money more than doubles the weekly maximum unemployment benefits in most states.</p> <p>The philosophical split is not pure. Kurzarbeit\u2019s shadow can be seen in the US\u2019s $669bn paycheck protection program (PPP). PPP was meant to help small businesses keep staff on the payroll during the crisis in return for forgivable loans. But that hastily assembled program has proved complicated to apply for and administer. Large sums initially went to big companies, including the LA Lakers basketball team and the Shake Shack burger chain. Many small businesses have complained they were squeezed out of the system or frightened off by the uncertainty over whether or not they will have to repay the money.</p> <p>Nor has the US\u2019s unemployment program been without problems. Many state systems have collapsed under the weight of applications \u2013 a situation that has left hundreds of thousand, if not millions, of Americans facing uncertain futures.</p> <h2>\u2018The whole thing was just so confusing\u2019</h2> <p>When the pandemic hit the US, Simon and Codi Bates were running three restaurants in the hip college town of Lawrence, Kansas. They closed everything in March and had to lay off 130 people. The timing was awful. Wedding season was just starting and the couple\u2019s Cider Gallery event space had to close its doors too.</p> <p>The Bateses did initially look at PPP. \u201cWe have had two different bankers and a whole team of accountants telling us different things at different times. We get calls at eight o\u2019clock at night on it,\u201d said Simon Bates. \u201cThe whole thing was just so confusing.\u201d Like many US businesses they decided they were better off letting staff go until the future was clearer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03bf19f3ffcc5d66e2e4b11631e50d640d7c7559\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03bf19f3ffcc5d66e2e4b11631e50d640d7c7559/0_206_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Bates at his restaurant, Bon Bon, in Lawrence Kansas, pre-lockdown: \u201cWho knows how people\u2019s perspectives have been changed by this\u201d\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Bates at his restaurant, Bon Bon, in Lawrence Kansas, pre-lockdown: \u2018Who knows how people\u2019s perspectives have been changed by this.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Dailey/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some of the people they laid off are now better off than they were when they were working. Bates has been slowly reopening his restaurants for takeout and has re-employed about a dozen people but at least one person who he asked to come back told him that he would rather wait it out on his supercharged unemployment benefits.</p> <p>That may not be a bad idea for both of them. \u201cOur business is a social business. Who knows how people\u2019s perspectives have been changed by this,\u201d said Bates. \u201cCarry-out may be the way things are for the next year, two years? I just don\u2019t know.\u201d In the near future, he may only need a fraction of his old staffing numbers.</p> <p>Other hard-hit industries like retail, hotels and entertainment may also face a long wait before business returns to normal \u2013 if indeed it ever does. Maybe it is better that the people in those industries make the shift to another one.</p> <p>\u201cThe danger [with this approach] is that if people become unemployed for any length of time, they lose their skills and they lose their ability to get back into the labor force,\u201d said Johnson, adding that just such an experience contributed to the US\u2019s slow recovery from the last recession.</p> <p>On the flip side, he added, the German model potentially ties people to jobs that may no longer exist.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Long term, the key here is how much is the economy going to change during this period of lockdown?</p> <footer> <cite>Ryan Bourne</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s certainly the position of Ryan Bourne, R Evan Scharf chair for the Public Understanding of Economics at Cato Institute, a libertarian thinktank. Although he questions whether we have enough data yet to say which approach \u2013 if either \u2013 will prove the more effective.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think, near term, that the unemployment numbers are the best metric to assess the success of these systems,\u201d said Bourne. \u201cLong term, the key here is how much is the economy going to change during this period of lockdown? I think subsidies to keep people on payrolls make most sense.</p> <p>\u201cIf, on the other hand, the economy is permanently changed, people don\u2019t want to go back to restaurants, people don\u2019t want to go back to cinema, people buy different manufactured products, then, it might seem harsh, but you want the economy to adjust and businesses will fail,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Time will tell which system proves better able to deal with the biggest economic challenge of the decade.</p> <p>If US unemployment continues to rise, there may be more pressure for the Trump administration to add some German to its economic lexicon. The Fox News host Tucker Carlson, a sometimes favorite of Donald Trump, has <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-coronavirus-crisis-economy-jobs\">referenced kurzarbeit</a> recently and the Trump administration is already discussing further bailouts.</p> <p>As both Johnson and Bourne point out, philosophical arguments over the relative merits of economic approaches to tackling the biggest job crisis in living memory will be tempered by stronger forces \u2013 political decisions and the course of the virus.</p> <p>But at some point, said Bourne, governments will have to face a big question. Does it make sense to keep \u201cemergency measures in place indefinitely for a potential future that might never return\u201d.</p>"
