If Social Security and Medicare taxes aren\u2019t taken out of paychecks, workers and businesses would take home a little more money with each paycheck. The idea is that workers benefiting from the cut would spend more money, which could help curb a recession.

She did not immediately comment further.</p> <p>The fight is all about state regulations versus county regulations, and Reuters reported it thus:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Musk has been pushing to reopen Tesla\u2019s Fremont, California, factory after Alameda county\u2019s health department said the carmaker must not reopen because local lockdown measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus remain in effect.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tesla\">Tesla</a> filed a lawsuit against the county on Saturday, calling the continued restrictions a \u2018power grab\u2019 by the county since California\u2019s governor had said on Thursday that manufacturers in the state would be allowed to reopen.</p> <p>The company said Alameda was going against the federal and California constitutions, as well as defying the governor\u2019s order, in the lawsuit filed in San Francisco federal court.</p> <p>Alameda county, where the Fremont factory is located, is scheduled to remain shut until the end of May, with only essential businesses allowed to reopen.

In case you didn\u2019t gather: we love Whoopi Goldberg and she must be protected at all costs. </p> <p>The show will be performed in front of a live audience, and Ru says that, in terms of the structure and format \u201canything goes\u201d. This SEEMS like it makes it easier but, actually, creating something without any limitations or guidelines can be much trickier, because it can run away from you. Just look at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/westworld--episode-by-episode\">latest series of Westworld</a>.</p> <p>As mini-challenge winner, Jackie Cox picks the running order and finishes by saying \u201cspeak now, because I don\u2019t want people to come back and tell me things are shady later\u201d. Some genius back-covering there. If more people thought do to that, people would communicate better, there\u2019d be less fights, less drama ... TV wouldn\u2019t be as good ... we\u2019d be out of the job ... OK, moving on. </p> <p>Heidi says \u201cooh, Jaida ... you in danger girl!\u201d A reference to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxBfukKmATo\">Whoopi\u2019s iconic line</a> and subsequent iconic gif, from the movie Ghost. 10 points to Heidi.</p> <p>During Jackie\u2019s rehearsal, Ru and Whoopi keep saying \u201cwho are you?\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re not seeing the real you\u201d which must be two of the most frustrating things a performer can possibly hear. \u201cI now need to synthesise 34 years of my life into a 3-to-5 minute story,\u201d says Jackie. Reminds us of our Zoom call last night. Or maybe Whoopi\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m not drunk\u201d reminds us of it more. </p> <p>Ru doesn\u2019t like Sherry\u2019s (actually quite clever) goldfish routine, saying \u201cit\u2019s high-concept ... we just wanna laugh!\u201d So basically, the Ru school of comedy is ... NOTHING TOO CLEVER. Makes sense. The most basic comedy is always the most successful. And that\u2019s the tea. Hi, Will Ferrell!</p> <p>Jaida says to Whoopi Goldberg that being on Drag Race is \u201calmost exactly like\u201d the journey of Celia in The Colour Purple. We must have watched a different version of that film. Whoopi looks ... sceptical. Gigi Goode is starting to admit defeat. Never a good sign.</p> <h2>The Stalk Market</h2> <p>This one has the same structure as last week \u2013 Ru\u2019s runway walk, some chat from the judges, THEN the execution of the main challenge, then the runway looks. It\u2019s a little confusing, but it works, we approve. A gorgeous look from Ru this week \u2013 pure glamour, pure drag, pure Vegas. Michelle is in leprosy-print, Whoopi is looking her discerning best and \u2013 brace yourselves \u2013 we LIKE Ross Matthews\u2019 jacket. Dahlia Sin is in the audience as a broccoli. \u201cShe\u2019s stalking us,\u201d says Michelle. Very good.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3326f35124514eda803d5e5a7b4a3ccd0f1fa074\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3326f35124514eda803d5e5a7b4a3ccd0f1fa074/119_106_1267_760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drag Race\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crystal Methyd wows as Phenomenal Phil, exotic dance instructor to the stars.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VH1</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jackie\u2019s show is touching and well-executed. Crystal\u2019s is hilarious \u2013 if this were in a drag competition in East London, it\u2019d make the final for sure. Heidi looks incredible but the comedy falls flat \u2013 it\u2019s like watching an awful school variety show performance. Ouch. Gigi is visibly struggling to remember some of her lines, but when she does, they\u2019re the cleverest and funniest lines of all the girls\u2019 routines. Although as we\u2019ve established, clever and funny doesn\u2019t necessarily make for marketable comedy. </p> <p>Sherry\u2019s seems interesting but at 17 minutes, takes over three times longer than it\u2019s supposed to. Sherry using her status as an accomplished performer to be <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-51765495\">manipulative and domineering</a>? Quelle surprise. Jaida tells a \u201cshocking\u201d story which, by the standards of drag and Drag Race, really isn\u2019t that shocking.</p> <p>The runway theme is \u201cThe Colour Purple\u201d \u2013 very good. Heidi\u2019s runway look is very ... well, it\u2019s very Jaida Essence Hall (on a budget). Jackie Cox\u2019s is very Crystal Methyd. Sherry\u2019s is the usual Sherry fare. Gigi\u2019s is Scoobalicious and Jaida\u2019s is breathlessly gorgeous \u2013 Beyonce just put down her salmon blini and sat up sharply.</p> <h2>Lipsync for your LIFE</h2> <p>Crystal finally wins a challenge. Heidi and Jaida Essence Hall are in the bottom two and Sherry Pie is safe. The song is Prince\u2019s 1999. With Heidi and Jaida both shimmering in purple gowns, whipping and slinking across the runway, this lipsync is iris-tinglingly pleasing, like ASMR for the eyes. Heidi goes home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/virgomazikeen/status/1259116411126980610\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1999!!!!

It\u2019d be infuriating even if we had no prior knowledge of her wrongdoings. She broke the rules and had a huge advantage over the other girls, by brashly steamrolling through an extra 12 minutes of stage time. For that, she should have automatically been in the bottom two. We\u2019ll be writing a strongly worded email to RuPaul, which he\u2019ll move straight to trash. He\u2019s probably massively regretting it, knowing what he knows now. So that\u2019s a small consolation.<br><br></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>The number of jobless people in the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/08/april-jobs-report-us-unemployment-rate\">rose by more than 20 million in April</a>, something deemed worthy of a mention in the \u201cand in other news\u201d slot on the BBC\u2019s evening TV bulletin.</p> <p>Sure, it was the 75th anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ve-day\">VE day</a> and there were socially distanced street parties to cover and archive footage of crowds gathered in front of Buckingham Palace to treasure.</p> <p>But hang on a minute. In the past, literary careers have been built on the sort of employment catastrophe that has just befallen the world\u2019s biggest economy. It is worth recalling that the war commemorated last week had its roots in Germany\u2019s 6-million long dole queues in the early 1930s.</p> <p>It matters a lot that the official US unemployment rate rose by more than 10 percentage points to 14.7% in a single month, that the real level of joblessness is actually around 25% and is likely to reach 30% before it peaks.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with the obvious. The April rise in unemployment was bigger than anything seen during the collapse of the US economy during the Great Depression, an economic tragedy that took several years to unfold. Inevitable once the decision was taken to shut down businesses in order to stop the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-\">Covid-19</a> virus from spreading, layoffs are hitting the poorest workers hardest. An employee in the bottom 20% of earners was four times as likely to lose their job last month as someone in the highest earning 20%.</p> <p>As in the UK, shuttering businesses across the country is proving easier to do than reopening them. The number of airline passengers currently stands at 7% of last year\u2019s level; in the states where restaurants have reopened for business the number of customers is around 10% of its pre-pandemic levels. The number of weekly jobless claims has come down from its peak but is still running at more than 3 million.</p> <p>All of which suggests that unemployment is going to stay high for some time. The chances of the jobless rate being below 10% by the time Donald Trump stands for re-election in November look remote.</p> <p>Unemployment \u2013 and the risk of being made unemployed \u2013 makes people miserable. There has been plenty of speculation in the past couple of months about whether the lockdown has been good for levels of wellbeing, but the survey evidence and the economic literature suggests it has not.</p> <p>Here in the UK, the Office for National Statistics said the levels of people reporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/04/half-of-british-adults-felt-anxious-about-covid-19-lockdown\">high levels of anxiety</a> more than doubled when the economy went into hibernation at the end of March. More than half the adult population \u2013 25 million people \u2013 said they were worried about their health, the security of their job or having enough money to get by.</p> <p>A separate coronavirus study from the Mental Health Foundation found that 34% of UK adults surveyed and in full-time work were concerned about losing their jobs; 20% of unemployed people surveyed said they had suicidal thoughts and feelings within the last two weeks; and 11% of unemployed people who have experienced stress during the pandemic said nothing had helped them to cope with the worry and anxiety.</p> <p>There may well be people who are sailing through the lockdown untroubled, but they probably don\u2019t include those who have lost their jobs, think they might be laid off once the government\u2019s furlough scheme comes to an end, or feel responsible as the owner of a small business for the livelihoods of others. Not for them the luxury of working from home on full pay or retirement on an indexed-linked final salary pension.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, it is reasonable to expect similar levels of stress and despair to be prevalent on the other side of the Atlantic, where the welfare state is not known for its generosity. Indeed, the work of economists such as <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w14318.pdf\">Danny Blanchflower</a> and <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2234639?seq=1\">Andrew Oswald</a> has highlighted how higher unemployment is the economic variable most strikingly linked to rising unhappiness, and the longer the spell of unemployment the greater the cost to personal wellbeing.</p> <p>Academic interest in the impact of unemployment on physical and mental health picked up in the 1980s, when deep scars were left by workers enduring long spells of joblessness and in some cases losing touch with the labour market altogether.</p> <p>A priority, therefore, is to prevent temporary layoffs becoming permanent, because that is the path to more poverty, more ill-health, more crime, more relationship breakups and more social alienation. Hence the current heightened interest in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/06/risk-dole-queue-future-young-people-after-covid-19-crisis\">job guarantee schemes for the young</a> and universal basic income for all to supplement strong doses of economic stimulus.</p> <p>The textbook free-market solution to unemployment is that workers can always price themselves back into a job by being willing to take a pay cut. Fortunately, no government in the world believes this nonsense, and the story of the past couple of months has been frantic attempts to prevent a health emergency from morphing into an employment emergency.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Britain\u2019s furlough scheme has been one response to this incipient crisis, but there has also been a response in the US, where Trump, keen not to become the new Herbert Hoover, has adopted a three-pronged approach. Firstly, the administration has provided an extra $600 (\u00a3474) a week in unemployment benefits until the end of July. Secondly, the president has pushed for a reopening of the economy on the grounds that the cure for Covid-19 should not be worse than the disease itself. Finally, he has sought to blame China for America\u2019s problems, because this a lot easier than blaming himself.</p> <p>What does that mean? It means the US has mass unemployment, an explosion of unhappiness, and a sabre-rattling populist leader willing to do anything to hold on to his job. Now, in other news \u2026</p>",
  "<p>Sleep restless, anxiety dreams, and if there wasn\u2019t enough to be concerned about I am worrying about our baby beans and peas.</p> <p>It is often like this in spring. The responsibility, it comes with the shorter nights and longer light, maybe I have more time on my hands. I have saved two hours a day on travelling and I only work a few miles\u2019 walk from home. This extra time has now become a trip to the plot, or perhaps pottering on the terrace. A more intimate gardening relationship cemented in the spring mornings. Deepened, more dependent.</p> <p>The seedling trays have been hardened off and transplanted. Courgettes, corn, bean and pea top-ups, too (from deep root trainers with a peat-free compost). So, now I lie awake worrying about predators. My babies are on their own, surrounded by birds and slugs and snails.</p> <p>It won\u2019t last long, they\u2019ll only need me until they can climb their poles. Free, adult, on their own. Until then, I feed, I weed, I water, I come as often as I can. I have bought an organic slug gel \u2013 organic pellets are impossible to find \u2013 I don\u2019t much like it, but I may need an armoury on my side. The pea shoots are barely adolescent, lolling around as yet. Their enemies will have to get past me. I know it is irrational, likely stuff half-buried in my past. But I am all they have at the moment. Or so I tell myself.</p> <p>Last year I sowed a nursery row of Gold of Bacau beans (creamy, prolific, from seed savers out of Romania, hard to find). They were bright greeny-yellow, jolly, two-leafed and 2in high, until resident pigeons cropped along them like kids eating corn.</p> <p>So I visit early most mornings, pop in of an evening, whisper thoughts of encouragement.
