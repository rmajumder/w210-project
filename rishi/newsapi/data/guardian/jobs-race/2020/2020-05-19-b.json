  "<p>Donald Trump has further touted his apparent taking of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as protection against coronavirus despite federal regulators warning of the potentially serious, even fatal, dangers.</p> \n<p>As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths continued to rise, Trump spent public appearances repeatedly talking about a dubious treatment and an economic comeback.</p> \n<p>The president claimed a recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/22/trump-hydroxychloroquine-study-coronavirus\">US study</a> indicating hydroxychloroquine was not an effective coronavirus treatment was a \u201cTrump enemy statement\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey were very old.

The frontline workers, many, many are taking it,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1262484956896518147\">said</a> on Monday. </p> \n<p>On Tuesday, McEnany <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpxqtUKaGSQ\">told Fox News</a>: \u201cAny use of hydroxychloroquine has to be in consultation with your doctor. You have to have a prescription. That\u2019s the way it must be done.\u201d</p> \n<p>The White House on Monday issued a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JDiamond1/status/1262536479613517826\">statement</a> by Sean Conley, Trump\u2019s doctor, which read: \u201cAfter numerous discussions he and I had regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relevant risks.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump then falsely claimed that evidence suggests hydroxychloroquine does not have negative side effects. \u201cWhat has been determined is it doesn\u2019t harm you.\u201d</p> \n<p>In reality, the FDA has said hydroxychloroquine should only be used as a coronavirus treatment in hopsital settings, due to \u201creports of serious heart rhythm problems\u201d in virus patients who had received the drug.</p> \n<p>When a reporter mentioned the FDA guidance, Trump said, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I was told.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Pelosi has expressed alarm.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s our president, and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and his, shall we say, weight group,\u201d the House speaker, 80, told CNN of Trump, 73, on Monday evening.</p> \n<p>\u201cMorbidly obese, they say. So, I think it\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump <a href=\"https://khn.org/morning-breakout/trumps-weight-officially-puts-him-in-obese-category-but-heart-expert-says-he-has-relatively-low-risk-for-cardiovascular-disease/\">is obese</a>, as the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines the term, but he does not appear to qualify as \u201cextremely obese\u201d, the top category. The ambiguity stems from unreliable data, as Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/17/a-tall-tale-accuracy-of-trumps-medical-report-and-new-height-questioned\">tends to exaggerate</a> his height and <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/article195077804.html\">lowball</a> his weight.</p> \n<p>The FDA <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-cautions-against-use-hydroxychloroquine-or-chloroquine-covid-19-outside-hospital-setting-or\">advised</a> in April that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/hydroxychloroquine-trump-and-covid-19-what-you-need-to-know\">hydroxych</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/hydroxychloroquine-trump-and-covid-19-what-you-need-to-know\">loroquine</a> and chloroquine \u201chave not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing Covid-19\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhile clinical trials are ongoing to determine the safety and effectiveness of these drugs for Covid-19, there are known side effects of these medications that should be considered,\u201d the FDA commissioner, Stephen Hahn, said then.</p> \n<p>The FDA has not updated that guidance. Experts warned that Trump\u2019s claim to be taking the drug could lead to a spike in demand, potentially making it harder for vulnerable patients who need the drug to fill prescriptions.</p> \n<p>After Trump hyped the drug in March, an Arizona man died from ingesting a form of chloroquine used to clean fish tanks.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe saw Trump on TV \u2013 every channel \u2013 and all of his buddies said that this was safe,\u201d the man\u2019s wife, who also ingested the drug, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VaughnHillyard/status/1242253997005664257\">told NBC</a>. \u201cTrump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Monday night a Fox News host, Neil Cavuto, expressed his concern, telling viewers: \u201cI only make this not to make a political point here, but a life-and-death point. Be very, very careful.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fox News opinion hosts Laura Ingraham, Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity swung behind the president but Trump was angered nonetheless, retweeting one Twitter user who called Cavuto an \u201casshole\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump also bemoaned the network\u2019s output since the departure of Roger Ailes, who resigned as chairman and chief executive in disgrace, after being credibly accused of sexual harassment.

  "<p>\u201cWe were asked to create a very simple ventilator,\u201d Chris Spicer says. \u201cOne that would ventilate a patient who\u2019d been anaesthetised.\u201d The Covid-19 pandemic was about to take hold, and Spicer and his team were being drafted in to help with a national emergency.</p> <p>Amid the many areas in which Britain was underprepared for the pandemic, one of the main causes for concern was the country\u2019s lack of medical ventilators. With the virus attacking the respiratory systems of those infected, just 8,000 machines existed in hospitals throughout the UK. Bracing itself for the worst healthcare crisis in its history, the NHS estimated that 30,000 ventilators would be needed to cope with the rising number of intensive care patients.</p> <p>More than 20 companies \u2013 including Ford, Rolls-Royce, McLaren and Siemens UK \u2013 formed the Ventilator Challenge UK Consortium, set up with the aim of producing medical equipment by using existing technological designs from Smiths Medical and Penlon, with materials and parts in current use in their industries.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a massive challenge,\u201d says Spicer. \u201cWe\u2019d never done anything like it before. It\u2019s also a highly emotional project. Everyone has someone in a vulnerable category \u2013 my grandmother is 95, lives in a care home, and is currently in hospital [although she\u2019s just tested negative for the virus]. That was a real driver, thinking, if that was your father or your granny in that scenario, how could you make that little bit of a difference?\u201d</p> <p>The starting point for Spicer, as project manager, was how to problem-solve under pressure and with social distancing in place. \u201cWe thought: \u2018What\u2019s a new way of thinking? How can we be super-agile in our approach to this?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut from Monday when we were contacted, by Friday we had a working prototype. We had set up a fully functioning ventilator that would meet the complete specification.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7248bdbcf759723eb0496dcc5c2c31d40784f5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7248bdbcf759723eb0496dcc5c2c31d40784f5a/40_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MMM Brief3 Ventillator challenge Case Study Pic 3 RC 190520 Ventilator prototype\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The prototype ventilator from Spicer\u2019s team</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Spicer and his team \u2013 including Tom Harling, a 25-year-old mechanical engineering graduate who had only been with the company for 18 months \u2013 worked with a partner firm that had experience in the medical industry.</p> <p>\u201cWorking in a highly bespoke environment making components for submarines includes critical safety, which lends itself well to ventilators,\u201d Spicer says. \u201cSome of the machine companies we use for submarine parts now make plastic valves for the ventilators. We\u2019ve been using kilometres of plastic to get these valves made, which are critical to the system.\u201d</p> <p>One of the biggest issues to overcome was the supply chain for parts. \u201cThis is a global pandemic,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd across the globe, the traditional medical supply chain is strained. We\u2019ve been able to develop a completely new supply chain that means we don\u2019t have to be reliant on that strained medical supply chain.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have worked around the clock to get it sorted. We\u2019ve had people driving up and down this country and Europe, picking up goods and passing them on to the assembly line to make sure it can be finished. It\u2019s currently day 58, and no one\u2019s had a day off yet. A huge amount of team effort has gone into this.

  "<p>Mark Acasio says he and his gorilla suit are joining the Las Vegas Raiders this fall. Acasio, a long-time fan from Brentwood, California, known far and wide as Gorilla Rilla, has shelled out $3,500 for home-game tickets and $8,500 for a <a href=\"https://lasvegassun.com/news/2017/aug/24/faq-psls-personal-seat-licenses-raiders-stadium/\">personal-seat license</a> (PSL) for a front-row seat at Allegiant Stadium, the Raiders\u2019 posh new home.</p> <p>Acasio has not missed a Raiders\u2019 home game in 25 years. Just because the Raiders will now be a one-hour flight from his home instead of a one-hour drive, he is determined to stay loyal to the team and to his comrades moving to Vegas from the Black Hole, the NFL\u2019s most infamous cheering section, at dingy Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum.</p> <p>\u201cOn the other hand, many other friends of mine have not, and will not, step foot in Las Vegas,\u201d Acasio tells The Guardian.</p> <p>They won\u2019t because Las Vegas is not exactly around the corner from the Bay Area, and because tickets in the sections at Allegiant Stadium envisioned as a New Black Hole are about double what they were in Oakland \u2013 $218.75 in Vegas, up to $110 in Oakland. There was a PSL in Oakland, but as far as anyone can remember, it was not much more than $500.</p> <p>But that is only half of the issue. Oakland had the Raiders twice: from 1960 until 1982, when they moved to Los Angeles for 13 years, and then again from 1995 through last season. The Raiders won two Super Bowls in their first stint in Oakland and another in Los Angeles, but the second stay was pretty bleak, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Las_Vegas_Raiders_seasons\">with only one winning season since 2002</a>.</p> <p>Although they knew that Mark Davis, the Raiders\u2019 owner and son of Al Davis, the legendary former Raiders\u2019 coach and owner, had tried in vain for years to replace the obsolete Coliseum, many of the team\u2019s long-suffering fans were enraged that the team abandoned the Bay Area again \u2013 and that Davis was hardly nostalgic about Oakland.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/11/oakland-raiders-move-las-vegas-nfl-fans-city-impact\">The Raiders helped unite the divisions in Oakland.

The Black Hole is also a global fan club with thousands of members. </p> <p>But the Black Hole is, well, <a href=\"https://theblackhole.com/\">let the club\u2019s website explain it</a>:</p> <p><em>We are a STATE OF MIND. Our state of mind has united the entire Raiders Nation over the years. We have grown from a few friends to a worldwide family made up of generations of fans young and old, from all ethnicities, races, and sexes. If you bleed SILVER and BLACK, then we are connected and you are spiritually part of us.</em></p> <p>Rob Rivera, a resident of Hayward, California, who is the president and co-founder of the Black Hole, tells the Guardian, \u201cThe move has broken our hearts, pissed us off. They proved loyalty is a one-way street in the NFL.\u201d</p> <p>Deboe was not a Black Hole denizen: \u201cThey stand up too long for me,\u201d says Deboe, who is retired and lives in Castro Valley, California. But he feels burned, too. Like Rivera, Deboe figures he will go to one or two Raiders\u2019 home games per season in Las Vegas, probably using tickets purchased by a season-ticket holder (with a PSL).</p> <p>Deboe is sure he won\u2019t become a San Francisco 49ers\u2019 fan. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely out of the question,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cNobody will do that.\u201d</p> <p>The Raiders did not return several emails from the Guardian about duplicating the Black Hole in Vegas. Marc Badain, the team president, <a href=\"https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/stadium/fear-not-raiders-fans-black-hole-will-live-on-in-las-vegas-1939654/\">told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in January</a>: \u201cA lot of the folks that sit in the Black Hole in Oakland bought tickets in the south end zone at Allegiant. Whether that happens organically, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>Deboe, for one, is not optimistic that will happen. He says that is \u201cbecause Las Vegas is a destination city. A lot of people take trips there from all over the country. Fans of other teams will see a road game in Vegas and will want to make a weekend of it. Oakland was a sold-out stadium of locals.\u201d</p> <p>There is a Black Hole chapter in Las Vegas, a good start. The chapter president is Cisco \u201cKid\u201d Ortega, whose job was relocated from the Bay Area to Vegas before the Raiders made their move. Ortega says the team has not been in touch with him, but when asked about a Black Hole II, he says \u201cWe are going to do our best to duplicate that.\u201d</p> <p>The chapter threw a Super Bowl party at the Westgate Hotel in Las Vegas just to get the ball rolling, although the coronavirus pandemic scuttled plans for the NFL to host its draft in Las Vegas in April, denying the Black Hole club some inevitable TV screen time and valuable publicity. Ortega is still optimistic for success in Vegas, though he understands the challenges.</p> <p>\u201cI know I can speak for many of us Oakland fans when I say this second relocation will always hurt,\u201d he says. \u201cMany of us, including myself, will not wear any Raider gear that says \u2018Las Vegas\u2019.

This showed a rise of 856,000 to 2.1 million in April, the biggest monthly rise since modern records began in 1971.</p> <p>Traditionally, the claimant count is a measure of the number of people out of work and living on state benefits, but part of the government\u2019s response to the pandemic was to make unemployment-related benefits available to those who were still employed. The ONS says it doesn\u2019t know how many people fell into this category.</p> <p>Another guide to unemployment is provided by wage data from HMRC, which shows that the number of people on PAYE fell by 13,000 in March and a further 457,000 in April.

The 20% drop in hours worked between the first and the last weeks of March provides an indication of the impact of the lockdown on activity and jobs. The 170,000 drop in job vacancies in the three months to April suggests that those unfortunate enough to lose their jobs are going to struggle to find new ones.</p> <p>Clearly, all that\u2019s visible so far is the tip of the iceberg. The official figures will eventually catch up with what\u2019s happened to the economy and when they do the unemployment rate is going to rocket. Labour market experts are expecting the unemployment rate to at least double to 8% in the next few months.</p> <p>The outlook would be even bleaker were it not for the government\u2019s furlough scheme. Without the wage subsidies covering 8m jobs, the UK would be on course for an unemployment rate of about 20%.</p> <p>Crunch time for the labour market will come between the start of August, when the government wants employers to start paying a portion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/12/uk-furlough-scheme-extended-rishi-sunak-coronavirus\">wage subsidies,</a> and the end of October, when the furlough scheme is due to end completely.</p> <p>At present, many companies are not laying off staff because the Treasury is picking up the tab for 80% of monthly pay up to a limit of \u00a32,500. If severe lockdown restrictions are still in place, Rishi Sunak will have a tough choice: extend the scheme or see the UK suffer a second wave of job losses. The pressure on the chancellor to at least keep furloughing for sectors most affected by social distancing \u2013 hospitality, leisure and retailing \u2013 will be considerable.</p>",

It\u2019s now obvious that the UK government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/furlough-qa-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">coronavirus </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/furlough-qa-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">job </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/furlough-qa-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">retention </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/furlough-qa-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">scheme</a> (CJRS), which subsidises 80% of people\u2019s wages but did not put the necessary duties on employers to prevent them from firing employees, is failing in the one thing it\u2019s meant to do: retain jobs.</p> <p>Job numbers haven\u2019t collapsed in other countries such as Denmark or Germany because they have security and democracy at work, not just wage subsidies. Unemployment in Denmark has <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20180116-focus-denmark-low-unemployment-rate-strict-controls-job-seekers-benefits\">risen to just 4.2%</a>. Unemployment in Germany has risen to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b6ba29e-c90a-4b68-a149-4847415d75ac\">5.8%</a>. It might get worse, but it\u2019s a fraction of the UK\u2019s problem.</p> <p>Unemployment isn\u2019t natural. It\u2019s a legal and social choice. In Germany, workers in companies with more than 20 staff can elect a work council that may veto or delay dismissals and get compensation to internalise the social costs. In companies with more than 2,000 workers, staff can elect half of the supervisory board of directors. The system was restored post-second world war, after Hitler abolished all labour rights. It restarted with a law that the <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Control_Council_Law_No_22_(10_April_1946)_Works_Councils#Articles_IV\">UK and US helped to draft</a>, but we\u2019ve failed to follow it ourselves. In Denmark, workers in companies with more than 35 staff have the right to organise <a href=\"http://www.worker-participation.eu/www.worker-participation.eu/index.php/National-Industrial-Relations/Countries/Denmark/Workplace-Representation\">cooperation committees</a> and workers elect up to one third of the board of directors.</p> <p>Democracy and security at work make enterprise more rational. Directors elected by staff ensure managers think in the long term. In this crisis, short-term thinking isn\u2019t even creating so-called shareholder value, just a sinking spiral of dole queues and shuttered shops.</p> <p>The unemployment pandemic is by far the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/global-report-coronavirus-us-unemployment-could-hit-25-warns-fed-chairman-as-japan-enters-recession\">worst in the US</a>, because it has the worst labour rights in the free world. Despite a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/washington-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-vote\">$2.2</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/washington-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-vote\">tn bailout</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/unemployment-us-data-coronavirus\">36 million people</a> have been fired. This probably means more than 25% unemployment, a crisis worse than the Great Depression. Americans have no self-standing job security rights, except to get 60 days\u2019 warning before mass layoffs. An arbitrary, incompetent or venal boss can say \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d for a good reason, a bad reason, or no reason at all. This is the Donald Trump system of job security. It\u2019s creating a \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d depression.</p> <p>But the UK can\u2019t be content with its laws. Yes, employers must give reasonable notice before dismissal. At no time can an employer dismiss an employee in a way that breaches the \u201c<a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wnx7DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=\">duty of mutual respect</a>\u201d, or the contract. After two years of work, employees can only be dismissed for a fair reason, as assessed by an employment tribunal, and have a right to a redundancy payment if the dismissal is for economic reasons.</p> <p>That\u2019s fine, but British workers have no votes at work (outside universities such as Cambridge or Edinburgh), and no voice or veto over dismissals. Many employers evade employment rights by drafting sham contracts, pretending their staff are self-employed. The CJRS, with a <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/launching-an-economic-lifeboat/\">\u00a330-40</a><a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/launching-an-economic-lifeboat/\">bn expected cost</a>, pays 80% of wages to any employee who is furloughed, and it also covers the self-employed. But the scheme came without job security and workplace democracy conditions, <a href=\"https://www.ier.org.uk/comments/ten-things-the-government-can-do-right-now-to-prevent-a-corona-depression/\">as labour law experts called for</a>. So, employers fire staff despite subsidies.</p> <p>A dwindling minority of economic theorists argue we need \u201clabour market flexibility\u201d, saying that rights kill jobs. But there\u2019s no credible evidence for this claim. For instance, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) \u2013 whose research has influenced the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 thinks employment protection legislation hampers job creation, productivity and investment. But the <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/lawarxiv/fmdu9/\">OECD\u2019s analysis</a> is based on breathtaking misunderstandings of employment law. By contrast, the latest credible research shows that job security and workplace democracy decrease unemployment, while <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ilr.12128\">improving productivity</a> and innovation.</p> <p>How can we stop the unemployment pandemic? First, we must change what got us here, and boost workplace security and democracy. In the UK, the secretary of state could amend the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) code that employers must follow before making dismissals. Such amendments could give all staff a voice on dismissals through elected work councils, if unions collectively bargain for them, or if five or more staff request it.</p> <p>We must strengthen our pension laws so that staff representatives, not short-term asset managers, control shareholder votes in companies. Then, to stop irrational layoff decisions being made to begin with, workers need the right to vote for representatives on their board of directors, like they do at Oxford University, BMW or H&amp;M. We already have a <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/lawarxiv/yxrfa\">democratic </a><a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/lawarxiv/yxrfa\">society </a><a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/lawarxiv/yxrfa\">act</a> drafted for the UK, and any US state can pass the workplace democracy and security laws they need without the federal government. States can adapt models such as those that have been proposed by senators Elizabeth Warren, <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/issues/corporate-accountability-and-democracy/\">Bernie Sanders</a> or Tammy Baldwin.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/17/normal-life-failed-coronavirus-rethink-economy-labour-party\">'Normal' life failed us. The coronavirus crisis gives us the chance to rethink a new economy | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second, because so many have already lost their jobs, we need an immediate freeze on dismissals, as France, Italy and Spain have done, and to cancel the dismissals that have taken place since March. The crisis of confidence afflicting business, forcing them to plan for a future of mass unemployment, comes from their fear of collapsing demand. Fear will dissolve with a credible recovery plan.</p> <p>Third, and ultimately, the government has to provide everyone with a job guarantee and a fair income by filling the gaps of our social security system. This is what the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/from-the-archive-blog/2018/nov/28/un-adopts-universal-declaration-human-rights-paris-1948\">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> requires: universal social security and the right to work for fair pay. From 1944, the UK government, with agreement among Conservatives, Labour and Liberals, maintained full employment for three decades. If we act, we can make the pandemic of unemployment history, and become a stronger, more caring, compassionate society again.</p> <p>\u2022 Ewan McGaughey is a senior lecturer in law at King\u2019s College London</p> <p><br></p>"
