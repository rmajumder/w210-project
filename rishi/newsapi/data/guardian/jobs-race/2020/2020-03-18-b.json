  "<p>White nationalist hate groups in the US have increased 55% throughout the Trump era, according to a new <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/year-hate-and-extremism-2019\">report</a> by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), and a \u201csurging\u201d racist movement continues to be driven by \u201ca deep fear of demographic change\u201d.</p> <p>Nationally, there were 155 such groups counted last year, and they were present in most states. These groups were counted separately from Ku Klux Klan groups, racist skinheads, Christian Identity groups, and neo-Confederate groups, all of which also express some version of white supremacist beliefs.</p> <p>Since the turn of the millennium, the report says, \u201cAmerican racists have fretted over what they fear will be the loss of their place of dominance in society\u201d as its racial composition changes.</p> <p>The report notes that the perpetrator of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/04/el-paso-shooting-white-nationalist-supremacy-violence-christchurch\">massacre</a> on 3 August 2019 in El Paso, Texas, where 26 were killed, and another man who attacked a synagogue in Poway, California, killing one woman and wounding three more, claimed to be motivated by the idea that white people were being replaced.</p> <p>The increase in hate groups includes many which openly advocate violence, terrorism and murder, and \u201caccelerationist\u201d groups \u201dwho believe mass violence is necessary to bring about the collapse of our pluralistic society\u201d, including organizations like the Base, Atomwaffen Division, and Feuerkrieg Division, according to the report.</p> <p>Seven members of the Base, six members of Atomwaffen Division, and one man, Richard Tobin, who is allegedly a member of both groups, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/neo-nazi-arrests-deals-blow-us-group-atomwaffen-division\">have been arrested</a> since last October on charges including firearms offenses, conspiring to vandalize synagogues and conspiracy to murder.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/neo-nazi-arrests-deals-blow-us-group-atomwaffen-division\">Sweep of arrests hits US neo-Nazi group connected to five murders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In January, the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/25/inside-the-base-neo-nazi-terror-group\">showed the inner workings</a> of the Base, including the lead-up to the synagogue vandalism allegedly coordinated by Tobin, and also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/revealed-the-true-identity-of-the-leader-of-americas-neo-nazi-terror-group\">revealed</a> that the group\u2019s founder was a Russia-based former security contractor, Rinaldo Nazzaro.</p> <p>According to the SPLC report, the arrests are evidence that federal agencies are finally \u201chearing the alarm bells\u201d regarding violent white nationalism.</p> <p>It points out that in the last year, \u201cthe FBI upgraded its assessment of the threat posed by racially motivated extremists to a \u2018national threat priority\u2019\u201d, and the \u201cDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) announced a strategic shift toward countering racial hatred\u201d.</p> <p>But the report says that those efforts are hampered by senior members of the Donald Trump administration like Trump aide Stephen Miller, \u201cwho has long been allied with anti-immigrant hate groups\u201d.</p> <p>Miller\u2019s attempts to insert white nationalist talking points into rightwing news website Breitbart\u2019s coverage of the 2016 election were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/12/trump-adviser-stephen-miller-white-nationalist-agenda-breitbart\">exposed</a> last year, but the administration has retained him in his senior role.</p> <p>While the report concludes the overall number of hate groups dipped 8% on 2018\u2019s record numbers, it says that this \u201cdoes not reflect a significant diminishment of the radical right\u201d, and that other kinds of hate groups continue to grow in number.</p> <p>Along with the increase in white nationalist groups, there was an increase in homophobic and transphobic organizations, with anti-LGBTQ groups increasing 43% in 2019. Many of those highlighted in the SPLC report are religious fundamentalists.</p> <p>The report calls for a \u201cnational movement against hate violence in America\u201d in defense of \u201cinclusive democracy\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>Daryl Davis is a musician \u2013 a pianist to be exact. He has jammed with the likes of Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, BB King and even Bill Clinton. Loyal to music but not to genre, he plays jazz, blues, rock\u2019n\u2019roll, country, boogie-woogie, swing, big band and beyond. No matter the musical style, Davis will play it, because he believes that music in all its variations is a great equalizer. So when he entered the Silver Dollar Lounge in Frederick, Maryland, for a country gig one fateful night in 1983, being the only black man present did not perturb him at all.</p> <p>While this was not his first country gig at the Silver Dollar Lounge, it was his most significant. After he and his band finished their set, Davis was approached by a patron who was around 15 years his senior. Not an unusual occurrence for a working musician. However, while praising Davis on his performance, the patron candidly noted that he had never seen a black man who could play like Jerry Lee Lewis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/18/african-americans-techno-music-los-angeles-clubs-whitewashing\">'Make techno black again': a social experiment subverts whitewashing in clubs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More curious than offended, Davis used this encounter as an opportunity for friendly discourse rather than outrage. \u201cI explained to this older white guy that Jerry Lee Lewis was influenced by the same black boogie-woogie and blues piano players as I was,\u201d Davis says with a chuckle. \u201cHe didn\u2019t believe me. Then I told him that Jerry Lewis is a good friend of mine and well, he didn\u2019t believe that either, but he was fascinated.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo he asks me to join him for a drink,\u201d he continues. \u201cI don\u2019t drink so I had a glass of cranberry juice and then he took his glass and cheered me. Then he said, \u2018You know, this is the first time I ever sat down and had a drink with a black person.\u2019 I was instantly curious and thought, \u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019 So I asked him why. He didn\u2019t answer at first but eventually admitted that he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.\u201d</p> <p>This is a story Davis shares on lecture stages and in classrooms \u2013 both nationally and globally. It is an important anecdote as it marks a catalytic moment in which Davis\u2019s trajectory pivoted from working musician to race relations crusader.</p> <p>What began as a hobby gradually transformed into a calling. As his music career continued to flourish, Davis also became enmeshed in quite arguably the world\u2019s strangest side hustle \u2013 meeting with KKK members of various ranks and attending so-called cross lighting rallies. Some of these Klansmen became close friends of Davis\u2019s \u2013 the aforementioned Silver Dollar patron included \u2013 their long conversations untangling a knot of hate that had coiled for decades. In many cases, these civil dialogues led them to quitting the organization because they no longer believed in its tenets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cb37d4aa759494b50a29aed84768443f96c38f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cb37d4aa759494b50a29aed84768443f96c38f7/0_0_1209_907/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daryl Davis and a KKK member.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daryl Davis and a KKK member.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Daryl Davis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While some say Davis converted these men, he prefers to say that they converted themselves, and that he merely provided the impetus for them to do so. Over the past 30 years, Davis has become well-versed in the organization\u2019s ethos and hierarchy which led to him to becoming the first black man to write a book about the KKK entitled Klan-destine Relationships: A Black Man\u2019s Odyssey in the Ku Klux Klan<em>, </em>which was published in 1998.</p> <p>The Ku Klux Klan was formed in 1865 by a group of Confederate soldiers at the end of the American civil war in an attempt to keep newly emancipated slaves suppressed. Having seen several iterations, what remains consistent across all chapters of the group is its hate toward people of color, sometimes resulting in assault and murder. In 2018, 153 years later, a record high of more than 1,000 hate groups \u2013 including the KKK \u2013 were documented as active in the United States by the <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/news/2019/02/19/hate-groups-reach-record-high\">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> civil rights group. \u201cOur ideology needs to catch up to our technology,\u201d Davis said recently as a guest on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGTQ0Wj6yIg\">Joe Rogan Experience podcast.</a></p> <p>So why would a successful musician like Davis willingly meet with high-ranking KKK members in his spare time? The journey to that answer begins long before his Silver Dollar Klan encounter in 1983.</p> <p>\u201cIn 1968, when I was the age of 10, I had a racist incident,\u201d Davis recalls with conviction, his voice sonorous and unwavering. \u201cI was in the Cub Scouts and we were in a parade when people started throwing rocks and things at me. I didn\u2019t understand why people would do that and I formed a question: \u2018How can you hate me when you don\u2019t even know me?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe answer was always, \u2018there\u2019s some people who are just like that,\u2019\u201d Davis adds. \u201cWell, that wasn\u2019t good enough for me. What does \u2018just like that\u2019 mean? Where does that come from? You\u2019re not born \u2018just like that. I was curious about racism ever since, but even still, nobody can seem to answer the question.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORp3q1Oaezw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ORp3q1Oaezw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>One of Davis\u2019s first and most fabled encounters was with Grand Dragon Robert Kelly, who eventually became the Imperial Wizard of Maryland. After having his secretary set up a meeting with Kelly under the pretense of including him in a book about the KKK, Davis knew he was entering new territory. Kelly was unaware that Davis was black, so the grand reveal was a shock. After a few tense hours of conversation, the two parted ways, but their relationship did not end there.</p> <p>Eventually, Kelly began inviting Davis to his home and then to Klan rallies in which ritualistic chants were intoned, giant crosses were burned, and beer and hot dogs were served. Kelly shared everything with him, including the deeply racial stereotypes that help form the foundation of the Klan\u2019s hatred. All the while, Davis listened, asked questions, took notes, and through his actions, slowly dispelled each stereotype one by one. With each conversation, the gap between them narrowed and they were able to become friends.</p> <p>Finally, Kelly quit the Klan, shut down his entire chapter and, as a trophy of sorts, gave his robe to Davis. That was not the last Ku Klux Klan robe that Davis would be gifted nor was it the last Klansman he would befriend.</p> <p>\u201cI still perform sometimes and though I would much rather be on stage playing happy music all the time and seeing people dance than be talking about the KKK and neo-Nazis,\u201d Davis says with a laugh, \u201cI have found that lecturing and talking and educating people is far more important and necessary today.\u201d</p> <p>Davis has lived through several eras of hate \u2013 from the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr in 1968 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/02/christopher-hasson-coast-guard-neo-nazi-far-right\">the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally</a> in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. Though he has convinced hundreds of white supremacists to deradicalize and join the land of the loving, he does not deny that some are beyond saving. However, that acknowledgment does not deter his mission as he continues to focus on those who are open to conversation, open to civil discourse, open to friendship, and ultimately, open to change.</p> <p>Most recently, Davis partnered with Minds.com, an open source social networking platform that uses blockchain to reward the community with ERC20 tokens. Davis hopes to utilize this platform, founded by Bill Ottman and John Ottman, to educate people on how to conduct civil discourse. Beyond the world of white supremacy, the idea is to help individuals navigate through opposing perspectives \u2013 be it at a political protest, in a classroom, on social media, or at the dinner table.</p> <p>\u201cPeople must stop focusing on the symptoms of hate, that\u2019s like putting a Band-Aid on cancer,\u201d Davis says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to treat it down to the bone, which is ignorance. The cure for ignorance is education. You fix the ignorance, there\u2019s nothing to fear. If there\u2019s nothing to fear, there\u2019s nothing to hate. If there\u2019s nothing to hate, there\u2019s nothing or no one to destroy.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>How did house music become so whitewashed? How did a black musical art form pioneered by black DJs during the 80s and 90s in black neighborhoods become so detached from its origins?</p> <p>In recent years, these questions and conversations around the gentrification of techno, house and rave music have increased.</p> <p>\u201cHouse music\u2019s co-option has followed a similar pattern to that of other black musics,\u201d said Micah Salkind, author of Do You Remember House?, a collection of over 60 oral interviews. \u201cBlack DJs \u2013 and in particular black gay DJs \u2013 were some of the primary instigators and innovators; white DJs followed and attempted to replicate their successes.\u201d</p> <p>In 2014, Chicago DJ Derrick Carter <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/derrickcarter/posts/10152907491022165?pnref=story\">wrote on his Facebook page</a>: \u201cSomething that started as gay black/Latino club music is now sold, shuffled and packaged as having very little to do with either.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"411c23ff5f5457787225cd544aa14564052d3593\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/411c23ff5f5457787225cd544aa14564052d3593/0_167_2600_1560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chicago DJ Derrick Carter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chicago DJ Derrick Carter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Black/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Frankie Decaiza Hutchinson, co-founder of Discwoman, a New York-based collective and DJ booking agency focusing on DJs of marginalized backgrounds, criticized the lack of diversity at Dekmantel and Awakenings last year, two major rave festivals held in the Netherlands. \u201cIt\u2019s so weak how people would rather blame those who are excluded than actually interrogate how it\u2019s fucked to have a techno festival of over 100 acts with only 5-10 black acts,\u201d she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frankiefatgold/status/1225162108222001154\">tweeted</a>.</p> <p>Last year, the documentary Black to Techno examined the birth of techno in inner-city Detroit and how white DJs from Canada and Europe whitewashed the genre. Elsewhere, black media theorist DeForrest Brown Jr launched apparel adorned with the call-to-action, <a href=\"https://www.factmag.com/2018/11/02/make-techno-black-again/\">Make Techno Black Again</a> last year.</p> <p>Of course, the gentrification of these genres and spaces fits into the larger relationship straight, white culture holds with the work of marginalized communities. White musical acts have adopted black sounds forever: from the Rolling Stones adopting the sounds of blues and jazz music to Australian rapper Iggy Azalea facing criticism for <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/ywbmk7/the-death-and-rebirth-of-problematic-white-girl-rap\">adopting a \u201cblaccent\u201d</a>. The history is long and complex.</p> <p>Welcome then <a href=\"https://www.nts.live/shows/rave-reparations\">Rave Reparations</a>, a self-described \u201csocial experiment\u201d, demonstrating the power of small-scale reparations. Formed by New York transplants Mandy Harris Williams and Alima Lee, the creative duo is working to combat this gentrification, striving to make it easier, and safer, for black people to attend Los Angeles dance parties, held at secret underground locations across the city.</p> <p>The problem is LA\u2019s pre-coronavirus shutdown nightlife scene \u2013 once home to a host of standout black queer venues, including Jewel\u2019s Catch One \u2013 has grown increasingly homogeneous, overtaken by \u201cwhite DJ bros\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"18c17da9b3769efc207798c46f36503e3340b156\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18c17da9b3769efc207798c46f36503e3340b156/63_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Los Angeles dance bar Jewel\u2019s Catch One.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Los Angeles dance bar Jewel\u2019s Catch One.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rave Reparations places a distinct focus on tasking white people to help their cause. They work closely with party promoters to offer discounted tickets to black, brown and queer people (typically 50% off full price), and organize crowdfunded donations for free tickets.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go down a list and ask, \u2018Who is the most marginalized body in LA?\u2019 So we start with giving free tickets to black queer trans femmes,\u201d Williams tells me.</p> <p>Lee and Williams also reach out to trusted white party promoters and ask them to vouch for and support up-and-coming black promoters (who often struggle, disproportionately more than their white counterparts, to rent out club spaces).</p> <p>\u201cNavigating the underground economy [of throwing parties in LA] is difficult because there is no Better Business Bureau,\u201d Williams tells the Guardian. \u201cThere are no rights or protections that black people have to not face discrimination for rentals. Sometimes owners will just say to black promoters, \u201cWe\u2019re not sure about the crowd you\u2019ll bring in.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>At its core, Rave Reparations is about highlighting how tangible labor and sacrifice is needed from white people to combat racism and exclusion. \u201cThis is based on a history,\u201d Williams argues. \u201cThe struggle for national reparations is slavery. The struggle for Rave Reparations is based on something that occurred literally within Alima and I\u2019s lifetime. My cousins share stories about attending Frankie Knuckles<em> </em>sets when they were younger, years ago.\u201d</p> <p>Williams and Lee say they were inspired to start Rave Reparations after feeling isolated and overlooked at many of LA\u2019s parties.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we set up these pricing schemes for parties that prioritize people who come from the diasporas of the music being played at each event,\u201d Lee explains of Rave Reparation\u2019s passionate attempts at restorative justice.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t feel comfortable at these events,\u201d she adds. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to dance and people are staring at you and wondering what you\u2019re even doing there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"624f22d2b2e13bca29892f63e787fc9200b790d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/624f22d2b2e13bca29892f63e787fc9200b790d4/0_160_3898_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cRave Reparations grew from us wanting and needing more space for our bodies,\u201d said Alima Lee co-founder of the social experiment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Rave Reparations grew from us wanting and needing more space for our bodies,\u2019 said Alima Lee co-founder of the social experiment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lee explains the unique and subtle microaggressions black people can face on the dance floor: \u201cThey\u2019re literally standing there and blocking you from moving and won\u2019t make space for you and your marginalized body.\u201d She pauses, emotional and frustrated. \u201cRave Reparations grew from us wanting and needing more space for our bodies.\u201d</p> <p>The work of Rave Reparations fits into a larger trend. In a short time span, reparations has gone from a far-fetched pipe dream to a concept discussed during the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dztdTWMoos\">2020 Democratic presidential debates</a>. Reparations \u2013 defined by Merriam-Webster as, \u201cthe act of making amends\u201d \u2013 is an increasing form of advocacy for black people today. The conversation has touched on everything from monetary payment to direct descendants of African slaves <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3bbay/sleep-gap-black-slavery-reparations-black-power-naps\">to more naps</a>.</p> <p>Even if large-scale reparations fail to materialize in the near future, the conversations hold power. Ta-Nehisi Coates, author of Between the World and Me, is largely credited with re-popularizing reparations through his 2014 essay, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/\">The Case for Reparations</a>. After that essay was published, congresswoman <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/sheila-jackson-lee\">Sheila Jackson Lee</a> presented HR 40, held a hearing on reparations and invited Coates to read his essay.</p> <p>However, reparations still confuses many.</p> <p>Lee and Williams are often asked, \u201cWhat is the ultimate goal of Rave Reparations? Does money really fix racism?\u201d</p> <p>The true power of reparations is not about solving structural racism through money, they say. It\u2019s having black people\u2019s struggles seen and understood. Lee explains: \u201cTo be seen, felt, and heard \u2013 that has the biggest impact on queer, black and brown people.\u201d</p>",

And yet on Reddit, the specialist forum website used by millions every day, many of Vancouver\u2019s cannabis connoisseurs still swear by their underground supply.</p> <p>This is one of the major issues facing North America\u2019s marijuana companies, which experts say are in the midst of a dotcom-style market crash.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/17/on-a-high-canada-celebrates-cannabis-being-legalised\">On a high: Canada celebrates cannabis being legalised</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Canada and 11 US states have legalised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/17/on-a-high-canada-celebrates-cannabis-being-legalised\">recreational use of the drug</a>, and a little over a year ago companies that cultivate and sell cannabis were seen by investors as one of the hottest tickets in town. Now billions of dollars have been wiped off the market values of the industry\u2019s largest companies.</p> <p>The North American Marijuana Index, which tracks listed firms in the sector, has plummeted about 80% in the last year and is at its lowest value since 2016, before much legalisation had taken place.</p> <p>The market capitalisation of Canopy Growth, the biggest firm in the sector by value, has fallen from $24bn in April last year to just over $6bn now, according to <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/WEED.TO/market_cap\">figures</a> from the financial data firm Y Charts.</p> <p>Around $2bn of that loss has come in the last week. Coronavirus fears, which have dragged down stocks across the globe, have not helped. But a large part of Canopy\u2019s latest share price drop came after the firm was forced to admit that it was struggling in Canada.</p> <p>The company announced last Wednesday that it would be closing two cultivation greenhouses in British Columbia \u2013 the western Canadian province where Vancouver is found \u2013 leading to 500 job losses. Canopy, which will be focusing on more cost-effective outdoor cultivation, also cancelled plans for a third greenhouse in Ontario.</p> <p>Bosses blamed the cutbacks on Canada\u2019s recreational market, which they said had \u201cdeveloped slower than anticipated\u201d.</p> <p>The consensus on Vancouver\u2019s cannabis-focused Reddit feeds is that the legal market is struggling to attract buyers because its product is more expensive but lower in quality than the black market alternative.</p> <p>\u201cThe government\u2019s pot is too expensive. The government doesn\u2019t show you a picture of what you\u2019re buying before you buy it, so you cannot be informed as a consumer. The government weed has been full of bugs, mouldy or too dry in some cases, and often takes too long to get there,\u201d one user said.</p> <p>\u201cThe legal stuff is garbage,\u201d said another Reddit user. A third said: \u201cFriends don\u2019t let friends smoke government weed.\u201d</p> <p>The sentiment is not confined to the realms of Reddit. Canadian government survey results released last month found that <a href=\"https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-003-x/2020002/article/00002-eng.htm\">40%</a> of the country\u2019s marijuana consumers admit to having obtained the drug illegally since legalisation.</p> <p>Omar Yar Khan, national cannabis sector lead at the consultancy firm Hill &amp; Knowlton, says legal sales have fallen short of expectations for a number of reasons. Legal prices \u2013 driven up by taxes \u2013 have been a factor in helping keep the black market \u201cas rampant as ever\u201d, he says.</p> <p>But Khan, who advises several cannabis companies on public affairs, also believes firms have suffered in Canada at the hands of regulations that restrict their ability to develop brands.</p> <p>There are strict rules around advertising for cannabis companies. Khan said: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to draw loyal consumers away from the illicit market to a legal market when there is very little brand identity amongst the consumer groups.\u201d</p> <p>Companies have also been held back in their efforts to open stores, often by local authorities that are against cannabis being sold in their areas.</p> <p>\u201cThere just aren\u2019t enough legal licensed points of sale across the country,\u201d Khan said. \u201cI think in Ontario now we\u2019re up to about 30. But there are over a thousand beverage alcohol points of sale. So if it\u2019s not convenient for consumers to access the product through the legal system, why would they ever leave the legacy illicit market?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/28/malawi-legalises-cannabis-amid-hopes-of-fresh-economic-growth\">Malawi legalises cannabis amid hopes of fresh economic growth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anthony Dutton, a co-founder and former chief executive of Cannex \u2013 a US-focused marijuana firm that is listed in Canada and was recently renamed 4Front following a takeover \u2013 believes share prices in the sector have been driven down by certain firms overpromising to investors. He believes some of these companies are likely to collapse or be taken over by stronger rivals in the future.</p> <p>Dutton, who remains a shareholder in 4Front and still advises the firm, likens the current woes of listed cannabis companies to the dotcom crash of the early 2000s.</p> <p>\u201cThe market got ahead of itself, started to drink its own Kool-Aid, and it was a classic example of any bubble,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what we\u2019re seeing now, thankfully, is a lot of the companies that probably should never have been financed \u2013 and probably should never have gone public in the first place \u2013 are slowly withering on the vine and they\u2019ll just disappear.</p> <p>\u201cNow there will be a consolidation around half a dozen strong operating companies, including 4Front, and those will be the companies that will take it into the next cycle.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt\u2019s just like in the dotcom boom.

It documented their stories through their photography, poetry and creative writing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90814430a0eec75d9827349c907d264087879fc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90814430a0eec75d9827349c907d264087879fc5/0_65_2500_1501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abrar with his portrait\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abrar with his portrait</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Smile-ing Boys Project is now in four more schools, but Rufai wants to eventually see this preventative work in all schools in the capital as an alternative provision to \u201ctypically punitive ways of dealing with kids that they struggle to engage with\u201d, such as pupil referral units or exclusion units.</p> <p>The Smile-ing Boys initiative was one of two contrasting projects to emerge last year that both used photographic portraits to challenge stereotypes of black boys and men, and the perceptions they may have of themselves.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.56blackmen.com/\" title=\"\">56 Black Men campaign</a> used a series of portraits of black working men wearing hooded tops to cast a spotlight on the issue.

He describes attending college among mainly black people and then stepping into a white world when he took up a degree in architecture. These experiences he says, helped \u201cinform a world view\u201d.</p> <p>He first conceived the idea in 2018 after his project to develop a studio for the local creative community in Peckham High Street stalled because of difficulties with the council and others over the building. Williams turned his frustration into positive action by launching a campaign to help black men change their own narrative.</p> <p>The portraits were a powerful way to attract attention and start a conversation. He chose 56 because this was how many <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/black-murder-victims-and-suspects-london-v-uk-11443656\" title=\"\">black men </a><a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/black-murder-victims-and-suspects-london-v-uk-11443656\" title=\"\">were murder</a><a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/black-murder-victims-and-suspects-london-v-uk-11443656\" title=\"\">ed in London in 2018</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThe premise really is for black men and boys to see ourselves amplified in a positive light for once,\u201d he says. He adds that 56 Black Men has become a \u201cmovement\u201d. Williams, who gives talks on issues around diversity and inclusion to FTSE 100 companies, says: \u201cThere are so many other positive black men out there doing stuff like this who don\u2019t get seen, who don\u2019t get the support they need. Instead of their efforts being highlighted, we\u2019re always talking about the negative portrayal of black men.\u201d With this in mind, Williams has big ambitions as the project enters its second year. He wants to raise funds to bring black men to the stage to tell their stories through \u201c56 Black Men Live\u201d events. An initial show held at Theatre Peckham in October, he says, was a success, but he hopes shows will be run at high-profile venues such as the National Theatre in the long run.</p> <p>Williams says: \u201c56 Black Men wants to bring storytelling to the stage, part of the reason being that we want black men to be in control of their own narrative.\u201d </p> <p>Williams is also planning a campaign against racism in football in the form of another portrait series featuring black men connected by their love for the sport. At the same time, he is working with City companies to create an \u201cexperience exchange\u201d to give black men direct access to business leaders in the City and other industries. It will help address the problem of black men feeling as if they do not necessarily fit the mould to work in these industries and also change stereotypical perceptions among chief executives and other decision-makers.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people live on one side of the river and these black boys live on the other side of the river \u2013 and they never get to have a real conversation. There\u2019s no forum set up for that,\u201d says Williams. \u201cSo how do we build more inclusive companies when we don\u2019t understand what it feels like to be this person?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/06/young-british-black-men-change-their-names-to-increase-chances-of-being-hired\">'They think I'm a gangster': the young black men caught in joblessness</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Williams, the overall strength of the movement will come in numbers and making connections with those who wield power and influence.

  "<p>This Democratic race isn\u2019t pining for the fjords. It is no more. It has ceased to be. Its metabolic processes are now history. This is an ex-presidential contest.</p> <p>The only reason the news networks could not call the Florida primary as soon as the votes piled up for Joe Biden was because the state\u2019s panhandle voters were still at the polls. Once those polls closed, the obvious was made official: it was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/2020-four-states-primaries-coronavirus-election\">blowout for Biden</a>.</p> <p>The last time we heard from Bernie Sanders after losing big in the last round of primaries, he said he wanted to debate the former vice-president head-to-head, one-on-one, to press his case directly and finally.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/16/bernie-sanders-lost-his-last-chance-to-take-joe-biden-down\">Bernie Sanders lost his last chance to take Joe Biden down | Nathan Robinson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhile our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability,\u201d Sanders said the day after his Super Tuesday defeats. \u201cDonald Trump must be defeated, and I will do everything in my power to make that happen. On Sunday night, in the first one-on-one debate of this campaign, the American people will have the opportunity to see which candidate is best positioned to accomplish that goal.\u201d</p> <p>Well the American people had that opportunity and they chose Joe Biden. If this is what winning the ideological debate looks like, Sanders should seriously consider debating another topic.</p> <p>The only topic the American people want to debate is the coronavirus pandemic and the severe recession that looks like the certain outcome of this quasi-national quarantine. Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/mnuchin-warns-virus-could-yield-20percent-jobless-rate-without-action/2020/03/17/2c8ece2e-68a3-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html\">told</a> Republican senators on Tuesday that unemployment could hit 20% if they didn\u2019t push through a huge economic stimulus as soon as possible.</p> <p>To put that into context, unemployment peaked at 10% after the financial collapse of 2008. It hit 24.9% in the Great Depression in 1933.</p> <p>Just one week ago, Bernie Sanders pledged to fight on, at a time when he was losing the delegate count by around 100 attendees of the Democratic convention. Judging from the projected vote counts on Tuesday, that delegate deficit just tripled.</p> <p>There is no reason for Sanders to stay in this race, no matter how fervent his fans and no matter how passionately he wants to advocate for his policies. He has spent the last four years advocating for those policies, pushing the Democratic party towards his ideas to remarkable effect.</p> <p>Back in the 2008 election and Barack Obama\u2019s first term, it was unthinkable to propose a public healthcare option: the defeat of Clinton\u2019s healthcare proposals was still too raw, more than a decade after they had failed. Today all the Democratic contenders proposed a public option, and Joe Biden\u2019s healthcare policies are far to the left of Obama\u2019s.</p> <p>Mission accomplished? <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/politics/bernie-sanders-biden-2020.html\">Apparently</a> not. Bernie\u2019s advisers say Biden hasn\u2019t done enough to unify the party, or generate voter enthusiasm.</p> <p>This is not a position supported by the primary results. Biden has won in the south and the north; the east coast and the north-west. When you win Florida by more than 60% of the vote, you\u2019ve pretty much unified the party. When you drive record turnout in the middle of a pandemic \u2013 which is frankly a reckless situation from a public health perspective \u2013 then you have reasonably generated voter enthusiasm.</p> <p>By any measure, Biden can feel confident in turning towards the general election and, more importantly, beyond that: to the historic challenge of pulling this country, and the rest of the world, out of a pandemic and global recession. It\u2019s unlikely that he will agree to another debate with Sanders.</p> <p>The pandemic is only accelerating the process that was first set in train by South Carolina\u2019s Democrats. State by state, poll by poll, Democrats \u2013 and voters in general \u2013 are saying that Biden is best placed to handle a crisis, and to unify the country. Those are not small issues at a time of multiple, historic challenges.</p> <p>Biden himself addressed the nation via live stream from his Delaware home, standing at a podium in front of two American flags. If it was indeed Biden\u2019s home, he has a strange taste in interior styling.</p> <p>Most of what Biden said was not a victory speech but the words of someone trying to reassure and rally a country being shaken to its core. \u201cTackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war,\u201d Biden explained. \u201cYes, this is a moment where we need our leaders to lead. But it\u2019s also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals are going to collectively impact what happens.\u201d</p> <p>He praised the public officials who allowed the voting to take place while supposedly protecting public health. And he praised Bernie\u2019s young voters for their enthusiasm and commitment, urging them to rally together with his campaign. \u201cI hear you,\u201d he told them. \u201cI know what\u2019s at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign, and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and then to unify the nation.\u201d</p> <p>He may not actually know what those young Sanders voters want \u2013 or he may not be prepared to adopt their agenda in full. But he was prepared to strike a patriotic note of national unity. \u201cThis is a moment for each of us to see and believe the best in every one of us,\u201d Biden said. \u201cTo believe in one another.\u201d</p> <p>There will surely come a time for another, younger Sanders-like leader to press for a political revolution that overhauls America\u2019s economy and social safety net. If this recession plays out like the last one, voters of all kinds will be hungrier than ever for radical change in four years\u2019 time.</p> <p>That leader may already be well-known to American voters: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will have just turned 35 \u2013 the constitutional minimum age of a president \u2013 by the time of the next presidential election. Bernie\u2019s ideas will live on long after his presidential campaign ends, which it should do within days, if he is serious about wanting the Democrats to defeat Donald Trump.</p>",

The agreement allows EU countries to band together to use their combined purchasing power to get a good deal on vaccines and other medical supplies.</p> \n  <p>The EU executive is organising joint procurement of protective clothing for medics, including masks, as well as ventilators. The commission spokesperson said \u201ca very big majority of member states [were] interested\u201d in taking part in the joint procurement on ventilators. The British government has not revealed whether it intends to take part in any of the procurement schemes.</p> \n  <p>On Monday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/vauxhall-owner-psa-car-shuts-european-plants-amid-coronavirus-fears\">urged British industry to step forward and build 20,000 ventilators \u201cat speed\u201d</a>. The NHS has 5,900 ventilators, but might need more than three times as many in the worst-case scenario for the spread of Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>The UK will be expected to apply EU-wide restrictions on the export of medical goods outside the bloc, passed in emergency legislation on Sunday. For a period of six weeks, EU countries and the UK will have to seek approval to export critical medical supplies outside the bloc.</p> \n  <p>Later on Tuesday, EU leaders are expected to adopt a 30-day travel ban on non-EU citizens entering the union, but the commission has said restrictions will not apply to the UK. There are exemptions for residents, diplomats, healthcare workers and researchers, and people delivering goods.</p> \n  <p>The UK and <strong>Ireland</strong>, neither in the EU\u2019s Schengen passport-free travel zone, are being \u201cencouraged\u201d to enforce the travel ban.</p> \n  <p> A UK spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK can choose whether to opt in to this proposal if it is agreed.

And we are continuing in that direction.\u201d </p> \n  <p>So far, Greek health authorities have announced 387 confirmed cases of coronavirus, revealing this afternoon that a fifth person had fallen victim to Covid-19.

Of the total number, 11 were in intensive care, he said. </p> \n  <p>Fearing the fate of Italy, the centre-right government has threatened to be merciless with those who flout tough restrictions that as of Wednesday will also include all shops being closed across Greece, with the exception of supermarkets. Banks, pharmacies, pet-stores, mobile phone stores, opticians, bakers, mini-markets, couriers and food delivery outlets are among the few that will also be allowed to remain open. </p> \n  <p>After nearly a decade of hard-hitting austerity \u2013 measures that hurt the health system in particular \u2013 Greek officials worry that hospitals would be rapidly overwhelmed if the outbreak required untold numbers needing intensive care. <br></p> \n  <p>Mitsotakis said the resources of private clinics would also be tapped during the health crisis and that with their help 1,900 additional beds would be available for coronavirus patients. </p> \n  <p>The government had three goals: containing the disease\u2019s spread, bolstering the health system and weighing in with support for workers as the economy feels the effect of the crisis. </p> \n  <p>Hinting that people\u2019s lives were likely to be put on hold for at least two months, Mitsotakis said: \u201cThe dangers will multiply over the next two months and because of that other new restrictions will follow.

Its main challenge is how to mass produce it, and at speed, company bosses told journalists. Trials of the drug, which are necessarily thorough, including checking its efficacy and potential side effects, mean that even if approved, it is not likely to be available until next spring.</p> \n  <p>It spent the first 15 minutes, though, attempting to quash the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/trump-offers-large-sums-for-exclusive-access-to-coronavirus-vaccine\">reports</a> in recent days according to which the company had been approached by the US government with an offer to exclusively buy up the vaccine it is working on, for one billion dollars. </p> \n  <p>First, to those rumours, the companies managers said they were just that. They categorically denied there was any truth in them, explaining that company bosses had been invited at extremely short notice to visit the White House last week, and speak to US government officials, along with representatives of other international companies working on coronavirus vaccines. This is despite the fact that the German interior minister, foreign minister, even the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the owner of CureVac, Dietmar Hopp, had commented on the reports as if they had been true, saying that \u201cGermany is not for sale\u201d. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis technology (to make the vaccine) can be applicable for anyone and there have not been requests for us to do it exclusively for the US,\u201d CureVac\u2019s deputy CEO Franz-Werner Haas told journalists. \u201cWe did not talk to Maas (the foreign minister) or Seehofer (the interior minister) so we cannot comment on that.\u201d</p> \n  <p>CureVac is a 20 year old company which develops therapies based on the molecule messenger RNA (mRNA) and has specialised in developing vaccines for infectious diseases as well as on drugs to treat cancer. Mariola Fotin-Mletczek, PhD, chief technology officer, explained the vaccine technology she is currently working on. \u201cNature has very good mechanisms for fighting against pathogens - viruses and bacteria - and with our technology we mimic nature\u2019s approach,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way we formulate this messenger molecule means it mimics this virus situation. </p> \n  <p>This means that we induce the immune response which is very similar to the natural immune response. With our approach, messenger RNA encodes one specific protein from the virus, the critical one, which is sufficient to mobilise the immune system. We do this in such a way that we use this natural mechanism which really helps to induce and to produce huge amounts of potent anti-bodies which neutralise the virus. </p> \n  <p>And that is exactly what we saw in the trial with our latest vaccine based on exactly the same technology. Also here we see that two doses of one microgram are sufficient to mobilise the immune system in the right way and to induce production of protective antibodies above the defined threshold, which means protection.\u201dShe said that laboratory trials on the vaccine would start in April and clinical trials would begin in the early summer.</p> \n  <p>The company has received an 80 million Euro grant from the European Commission in the last few days, which will enable it to \u201caccelerate the upscaling of a manufacturing unit which would produce the vaccine which is already being built,\u201d according to Florian von der M\u00fclbe, chief production officer and co-founder of CureVac. </p> \n  <p>This means once it got the go-ahead, the company could potentially produce high quantities of the drug so that it could be made available worldwide. The production facilities could be replicated easily elsewhere, increasing the efficiency and speed with which it could be made available, he added.</p> \n  <p>Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute, the main public health body in Germany, said earlier today, the concept was based on tumour therapy, with the vaccine \u201creacting to the protein in the virus and receiving an answer from it\u201d.

Greek Orthodox Church suspended daily services.</strong> Against a backdrop of incredulity and consternation, the Greek Orthodox church has, if reluctantly, decided to suspend daily services after a marathon session of its Holy Synod, citing the need to prevent the spread of Coronavirus.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/come-back-monday-ok-hundreds-of-prisoners-escape-in-brazil-amid-covid-19-anger\">Hundreds of prisoners escaped</a> from prisons in S\u00e3o Paulo state</strong> in the South East of Brazil on Monday. </li> \n   <li><strong>Amazon.com Inc on Monday said it would </strong><strong>hire 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers</strong> in the United States to deal with a surge in online orders, as many consumers have turned to the web to meet their needs during the coronavirus outbreak. </li> \n   <li><strong>All cricket in Australia has been cancelled</strong>, including the Sheffield Shield final, with NSW declared champions.</li> \n   <li><strong>US president Donald Trump has posted a tweet referring to Covid-19 as \u201cthe Chinese Virus\u201d. </strong>Trump also warned that social upheaval caused by the outbreak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/trump-coronavirus-guidelines-press-conference\">could last beyond August</a>.</li> \n   <li><strong>New Zealand announced an enormous spending package,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/new-zealand-launches-massive-spending-package-to-combat-covid-19\">equivalent to 4% of the country\u2019s GDP</a> in an attempt to fight the effects of Covid-19 on the country\u2019s economy, in what ministers called the most significant peace-time economic plan in the country\u2019s modern history.</li> \n   <li><strong>Californians were urged to \u2018shelter in place\u2019.</strong> San Francisco and five other Bay Area counties in California have ordered all residents to shelter-in-place to curb the spread of coronavirus, in a drastic move similar to ones taken in Italy, Spain and China, but the first of its kind in the US. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/16/shelter-in-place-california-coronavirus-bay-area-explained\">Here is what the order means</a>. </li> \n   <li><strong>The Ohio primary was ordered to be delayed on health grounds.</strong> The state\u2019s governor, Mike DeWine, had recommended on Monday that in-person voting during Tuesday\u2019s primary elections be postponed.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Sydney Opera House announced it would cancel all public performances</strong> starting Tuesday, March 17. </li> \n   <li><strong>The UN Security Council called off its remaining two remaining meetings for the week</strong>, Agence France-Presse reported. </li> \n   <li><strong>China\u2019s state planner said the economy would return to normal</strong> in the second quarter, as the country reported just one case outside Wuhan. <br></li> \n   <li><strong>Australia is looking at developing a mass testing process. </strong>The country has 415 confirmed cases of coronavirus. </li> \n   <li><strong>The head of the World Health Organizaion, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, implored governments to test more suspected cases, </strong>warning that they cannot fight the pandemic blindfolded.<strong> </strong><br></li> \n   <li><strong>The White House recommended isolation.</strong> US President Donald Trump told Americans to avoid any gatherings of more than 10 people over the next 15 days and advising all states with evidence of community transmission to close down bars, restaurants, gyms and other facilities.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Here is the most recent <a

Sorry to say that I, today, have tested positive for COVID19, Corona virus. My familiy and I are self-isolating at home for as long as it takes. We are in good health - I only have mild symptoms of a cold. There are people at higher risk for who this virus might be a devastating diagnosis, so I urge all of you to be extremely careful; wash your hands, keep 1,5 meters distance from others, go in quarantine; just do everything you can to stop the virus from spreading. Together we can fight this virus and avert a crisis at our hospitals. Please take care of each other, keep your distance, and stay healthy! Please visit your country&amp;#39;s Center for Disease Control&amp;#39;s website, and follow the regulations for staying safe and protecting not just yourselves, but our entire community, and especially those at risk like the elderly and people with pre-existing conditions. @grymolvaerhivju #fightcorona #solidarity #takecare #folkehelseinstituttet Thanks to @panoramaagency</a></p> <p style=&quot;
