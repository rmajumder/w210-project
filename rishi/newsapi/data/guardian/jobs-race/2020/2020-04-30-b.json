  "<p>Governor Andy Beshear has contacted a Kentucky resident, Tupac Malik Shakur, to apologize for delaying his unemployment cheque because he believed he was impersonating the deceased rapper of the same name.</p> <p>On Monday, Beshear described problems he was having processing unemployment claims in Kentucky, where almost<a href=\"https://www.kentucky.com/news/state/kentucky/article242227386.html\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.kentucky.com/news/state/kentucky/article242227386.html\">one in four</a> residents has filed for unemployment, singling out Shakur, who he thought was acting maliciously.</p> <p>In a televised briefing, Beshear said: \u201cWe had somebody apply for unemployment for Tupac Shakur here in Kentucky and that person probably thought they were being funny.\u201d He continued to accuse the alleged bad apple for delaying payments to other people: \u201cOne person thinking they were funny using someone else\u2019s identity is gonna make tens of thousands potentially of other people wait.\u201d</p> <p>His announcement probably gave some clarity to Shakur, a 46-year-old line cook from Lexington, <a href=\"https://www.kentucky.com/news/state/kentucky/article242331811.html\">who applied for unemployment after his restaurant closed down</a> in March and was still waiting to receive his first check. \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling for like the last month trying to figure out how to pay the bills,\u201d Shakur told the Lexington Herald-Leader.</p> <p>According <a href=\"https://www.kentucky.com/news/state/kentucky/article242331811.html\">to local reports, </a>Shakur legally changed his name because Shakur means \u201cthankful to God\u201d in Arabic</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/us-coronavirus-stimulus-all-you-need-to-know\">US coronavirus stimulus checks: are you eligible and how much will you get?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While his legal surname remains the same, Shakur now uses his middle name, Malik, because of the understandable confusion that arises from it. Following Beshear\u2019s original announcement, Shakur said he was upset at being publicly labelled a prankster.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m hurt, I\u2019m really embarrassed and I\u2019m shocked,\u201d Shakur told the Herald-Leader.</p> <p>The next day, Beshear publicly apologized for his statement, and accepted that he had made a mistake. He said: \u201cLast night I spent a little bit of time talking about fraudulent claims holding us up \u2026 I didn\u2019t know, and it\u2019s my fault, that we have a Kentuckian who goes by Malik, whose name is Tupac Shakur.\u201d</p> <p>Beshear has now called Shakur to apologize personally, and there is no longer any bad blood between the two. Beshear commended Shakur\u2019s gracious phone manner and said Shakur had even apologized to the governor for the embarrassment the mistake had brought him.</p> <p>\u201cI understand, he\u2019s dealing with a lot,\u201d Shakur later told the Lexington-Herald, adding: \u201cMistakes happen.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Another 3.8 million people lost their jobs in the US last week as the coronavirus pandemic continued to batter the economy.

Boeing announced this week that the coronavirus had delivered \u201ca body blow\u201d to its business and is weighing laying off 16,000 people, a 10% cut to its 161,000 workforce.

The monthly report is regarded as a more accurate snapshot of the jobs market but often lags the weekly report.</p> <p>In March the jobless rate rose 0.9%, the largest single-month change since January 1975, to 4.4%. The pandemic shutdowns started in late March, so April will give a more accurate picture of their impact on the jobs market. JP Morgan is predicting unemployment could reach 20%.</p>",
  "<p>If the affliction of coronavirus has shamed us into anything, it is a vivid appreciation of just how cruelly topsy-turvy our world is. Low-paid healthcare workers, bin collectors, bus drivers and supermarket shelf stackers, not hedge fund managers or venture capitalists, have kept us from falling apart. It has taken actual disaster to expose the deep-seated social injustices and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/sep/09/inequality-is-it-rising-and-can-we-reverse-it\"> inequalities</a> that we knew, but seemed to have forgotten, are hardwired into our economy. So could the global convulsion caused by the pandemic put us on the path to greater equality?</p> <p>The Austrian economic historian Walter Scheidel argues that throughout history, from the stone age onwards, pandemic is one of the only four events capable of bringing about greater equality. War, state collapse and revolution are the other three.</p> <p>In his book <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691183251/the-great-leveler\">The Great Level</a><a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691183251/the-great-leveler\">er</a> he showed how the Black Death in the 1300s led to the wipeout of a third of Europe\u2019s population and massively reduced inequality by raising the price of labour. More recently, in the 20th century, two catastrophic world wars and the Communist revolution led to a long era of reduced inequality lasting until the early 1980s and giving rise to the modern welfare state, labour unions and progressive taxation.</p> <p>So could the pandemic of our era, <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1060702\">already considered</a> the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/coronavirus-biggest-global-threat-since-wwii-un-chief-2020-4\">greatest global crisis</a> since the second world war, turn out to be a great societal leveller?</p> <p>Scheidel\u2019s short answer is that the longer the pandemic wreaks havoc on the global economy, the greater the potential for radical equalising change. \u201cIt depends on how severe the crisis is going to be, how long it\u2019s going to last and how much it\u2019s ultimately going to interrupt supply chains.\u201d</p> <p>The pandemic has already exposed the limits of the market and highlighted the importance of effective state intervention and strong public healthcare provision. In the future this may well create a tolerance for higher and more progressive taxation. Governments have had to intervene to prop up businesses and jobs in ways that only months ago would have seemed unimaginable. The viability of a universal basic income \u2014 a dream for egalitarians worldwide \u2014 is once again part of the mainstream debate in many countries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e58a0521d46896c34820f75ea3caff8c2337f66d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e58a0521d46896c34820f75ea3caff8c2337f66d/0_0_2126_1517/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pieter Bruegel the Elder, The Triumph of Death Probably after 1562, Madrid, Museo Nacional del Prado\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pieter Bruegel the Elder\u2019s The Triumph of Death: \u2018The Black Death led to the wipeout of a third of Europe\u2019s population.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Baztan Lacasa Jose/Museo Nacional del Prado</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The response at EU level also shows a willingness for strong public intervention and an end to the fiscal restraint approach of the last decade \u2014 at least, temporarily. </p> <p>As people start to believe in government intervention again, the post-corona political landscape may well provide fertile soil for reversing a situation where, since 1980, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2019/may/14/britain-risks-heading-to-us-levels-of-inequality-warns-top-economist\">richest 1% in the UK</a> have tripled their share of household income and the wealth of the <a href=\"https://wid.world/document/bcg2019-full-paper/\">European top 1%</a> grew twice as fast as the bottom 50%.</p> <p>But Scheidel cautions that, while disasters are not uncommon, tectonic shifts are historical anomalies. In other words, it may take a disaster to usher in more equality, but not every disaster does.</p> <p>\u201cWe had very special circumstances for a generation after the second world war, when all the factors were present in the right way \u2014 strong growth, low inequality, a strong middle class, expansion of the welfare state, all these things simultaneously. That may be very difficult to replicate,\u201d says Scheidel.</p> <p>Nobody would want mass death on the scale of the bubonic plague in the 14th century to be the instrument by which we achieve social change. And fortunately mortality rates from coronavirus will be nothing equivalent to those levels. \u201cEvery year, 60 million people die of natural causes worldwide. The death toll from corona is probably going to be less, even in the worst case scenario.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus\u2019s transformative potential, Scheidel explains, consists in adding a shock to an already powerful groundswell of anger.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m very sceptical about is the idea that ideology, or rhetoric, or just political agitation by itself can change things. What you need is essentially a combination of a certain kind of ideas being out there, and then a shock to the established order that allows those ideas to become mainstream.\u201d</p> <p>Lockdown culture has divided the haves from the have nots in the most tangible ways: while middle- and upper-class urbanites could flee to holiday homes, the lowest paid have been confined to cramped flats or forced to run the gauntlet of public transport to get to their key worker jobs.</p> <p>And, while white-collar workers complain about the complications of remote working, for a sizeable chunk of the world\u2019s labour force self-isolation means <a href=\"https://www.arabnews.com/node/1650216/world\">going hungry</a>.</p> <p>Similarly, as Scheidel points out, the damage done by the closure of schools has been felt unevenly. \u201cWe have a billion children around the world who are not going to school \u2026 and some are able to be schooled online because the households have proper internet connections and others don\u2019t. That\u2019s a very fundamental inequality. There are a number of these inequalities that have always existed, but we\u2019re becoming very painfully aware of them.\u201d</p> <p>Will all this awareness spill over into demands for political transformation? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take all that much,\u201d says Scheidel. \u201cAll we really need is a certain increase in the percentage of people who support certain policies for those policies to become mainstream. There is now a greater potential for a sufficiently large number of people to say, \u2018maybe we should be doing something about this\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>But there\u2019s an important caveat; much of the coronavirus\u2019s levelling potential will depend on our willingness to suffer significant economic losses in the short and medium term.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The less equal countries face darker choices between carrying on as before and experiencing real change</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since the \u201cend of history\u201d in the 1980s ushered in 40 years of neoliberal deregulation, inequality has generally been seen as an acceptable or even necessary price to pay for prosperity. That changed after the 2008 financial crash ignited the Occupy movement, lifting the veil on the existence of the 1%. Suddenly, inequality went from being a subject studied by a handful of economists to one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/21/world-26-richest-people-own-as-much-as-poorest-50-per-cent-oxfam-report\">defining issues</a> of the last decade.</p> <p>Still, the 2008 crash <a href=\"https://www.socialeurope.eu/eu-income-inequality-great-recession\">wasn\u2019t the leveller </a>many had hoped it would be. In fact, it <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/09/research-how-the-financial-crisis-drastically-increased-wealth-inequality-in-the-u-s\">produced the largest spike in wealth inequality</a> in postwar history by devastating the one thing low-income people in most western economies depend on most for their wealth: home ownership.</p> <p>On the same day that coronavirus caused the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/27/stock-market-today-live.html\">worst point drop</a> in the history of the Dow Jones, the economist Branko Milanovi\u0107 optimistically <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brankomilan/status/1232850693926637570?lang=en\">tweeted</a>: \u201cMy friend @WalterScheidel must feel vindicated. Coronavirus has already shaved off about 1/2 a Gini point of US wealth inequality. And this seems to be only a beginning.\u201d</p> <p>Milanovi\u0107 was referring to the Gini coefficient, a commonly used measure of inequality that measures income or wealth distribution among a population.</p> <p>Scheidel sees the newly collapsed assets of billionaires rebounding over the next few years as they did after the 2008 financial crash. \u201cIt took a few years, and then the top 1% were back to where they were before the financial crisis. That\u2019s likely to happen again with all the measures taken to shore up corporations and preserve the financial sector.\u201d </p> <p>Meanwhile, mass unemployment and the loss of income or healthcare will hit the poor hardest, pushing many people into debt, further widening the gap between rich and poor.</p> <p>But could the coronavirus crash do what the 2008 crash didn\u2019t? Not if there\u2019s a swift recovery but, says Scheidel: \u201cIf we\u2019re entering a more long-term depression as a result of Covid-19, I think all kinds of more radical policies will be on the table for the first time in a very long time.\u201d</p> <p>Much, he thinks, depends on the early discovery of a vaccine. \u201cThen you could say science will save the status quo, because it makes it possible for us to return to business as usual quite swiftly.</p> <p>But now assume that science fails to do that because the virus is more complicated and can\u2019t be fixed in the short term, then you\u2019ll have a more severe protracted crisis, with greater potential for transformative change.\u201d</p> <p>That may translate to stronger state intervention, better protections for workers in domestic industries, limits to outsourcing, higher taxation and more robust healthcare systems \u2014 if only because it will be impossible to justify the shortages of face masks and other essential equipment that have already cost countless lives.</p> <p>It will also be difficult to resist the temptation to go back to business as usual. \u201cThere will be a strong push to go back to growth to finance the huge deficits that governments have been racking up, so, if anything, growth will be more important than before,\u201d says Scheidel. \u201cAt the same time, if the effects of the pandemic polarise societies even more, there will also be stronger agitation for more progressive or distributive policies. It will be very difficult to reconcile those two motivations.\u201d</p> <p>The real clash of interests, he predicts, will be between those determined to go back to the status quo even at the price of making existing inequality worse and those who want a reset.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see enough engagement with the fact that this is going to be a real struggle between countervailing forces that push in different directions. The big question is which one will have the upper hand, in which place, and for how long.\u201d</p> <p>The most unequal democracies like the US and the UK, where inequality of income is estimated to be among the highest in Europe, could experience the biggest shifts. \u201cThe less equal countries face darker choices between carrying on as before and experiencing real change,\u201d says Scheidel. \u201cSo, somewhat paradoxically, the potential for actual change is biggest in the less equal countries.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, \u201cIf you are in China, the shock will not lead to more equalising policies. It will lead to a tightening of control and more business as usual.\u201d</p> <p>Time will tell if Scheidel can feel the vindication of Milanovi\u0107\u2019s forecast. As the pandemic devastates the world economy, hitting the poor hardest of all, short-term solutions aimed at restoring \u201cnormality\u201d are likely to outweigh lofty visions for a more equal society.</p> <p>And if he is right that the recipe for equality is prolonged suffering, things may have to get a lot worse before they can get better.
