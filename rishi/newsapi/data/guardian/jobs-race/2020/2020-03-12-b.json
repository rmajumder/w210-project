  "<p>Almost two-thirds of white evangelical Protestants in the US believe \u201ctheir side\u201d is winning politically under the Trump administration, according to a new survey.</p> <p>The proportion has increased steadily during Trump\u2019s presidency. In May 2016, six months before he was elected, 23% of white evangelical Protestants said their side was winning politically, rising to 36% two years ago, and 63% last month.</p> <p>The survey, published by the Pew Research Center on Thursday, found that a big majority of white evangelical Protestants in the US \u2013 a key part of Trump\u2019s electoral base \u2013 believed the president was good for their interests, but they had more mixed views on his personal attributes.</p> <p>More than eight in 10 said the Trump administration \u201cfights for what I believe in\u201d either very or fairly well. But markedly fewer \u2013 61% \u2013 said the phrase \u201cmorally upstanding\u201d described the president very or fairly well.</p> <p>\u201cEven among this strongly supportive constituency, most do not view Trump as a very religious, honest or morally upstanding person,\u201d said the report.</p> <p>In more general terms, 63% of both all US adults and white evangelical Protestants said it was very important to them to have a president who \u201cpersonally lives and moral, ethical life\u201d.</p> <p>Almost half - 49% \u2013 of all US adults said the Bible should influence the laws of the country, a proportion which rose to 89% among white evangelical Protestants.</p> <p>One in 20 US adults believe that \u201cGod chose Trump because God approves of Trump\u2019s policies\u201d, rising to 13% among white evangelical Protestants.</p> <p>\u201cAcross all religious groups in this analysis, there is near consensus on one Trump characteristic: majorities of all groups, including 70% of white evangelicals, say that \u2018self-centered\u2019 describes Trump at least fairly well,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>In general, 83% of white evangelicals identify with or lean towards the Republican party, the survey found. White evangelical Protestants form 16% of the US population, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/17/americans-less-christian-religion-survey-pew\">Pew found last year</a>.</p> <p>Pew questioned almost 6,400 US adults last month.</p>"
