  "<p>I was born in London, to Indian parents who grew up in apartheid-era South Africa. When I was seven we left Wimbledon for a tiny village in the Laurentian mountains, in Quebec, where our back garden was a wilderness. A year and a half later, we moved again to Montreal and the St Lawrence river flowed at the end of our suburban street. As a child, there was never a moment when I didn\u2019t dream of becoming a writer, or of travelling abroad. But I never saw or read about anyone like me, a small, brown woman, going off and doing adventurous things. I\u2019d see those men \u2013 and it was always men \u2013 in books and on TV and I\u2019d wonder how they made these things happen. Why did they get to have all the fun? Becoming a travel writer was the dream, spending time in wild landscapes too \u2013 for me there is not a great schism between travel writing and narrative nature writing, at least the kind I now enjoy reading.</p> <p>Long before I even thought it possible to write professionally, I\u2019d make frequent visits to the holy of holies, Stanfords Travel Bookshop. Here I\u2019d trawl the shelves, desperate to read about someone, anyone, who looked like me, or looked at the world through a prism other than the prevailing one. I can still recall my delight when stumbling upon Eddy L Harris\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-03-01-bk-5277-story.html\">Native Stranger: A Black American\u2019s Journey into the Heart of Africa</a></em>. I was fascinated: here was a man with black skin who was seeking to know himself better while roaming in the land of his ancestors. As he put it: \u201cThere is a line that connects the place we come from and the place we find ourselves, those lives and our lives. And I longed to follow that line.\u201d This was very different from the escapist, \u201chero lit\u201d, travelogues written by white men who wrote about the people they encountered and landscapes they traversed as though mere backdrops to their adventuring prowess. Though Harris\u2019s background and experiences were different from my own, they felt infinitely more relatable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Whenever I have been about to set off anywhere, I can\u2019t help but wonder: how will I be received?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jul/09/society\">Pico Iyer</a>\u2019s 1988 book <em>Video Night in Kathmandu</em>, about his travels in Nepal and exploration of the Americanisation of ancient civilisations, I remember thinking, how did he make that book happen? I think I was more interested in how a man like him even got published than in the narrative itself. He wrote of having become accustomed to \u201ccross-cultural anomalies and the mixed feelings of exile\u201d in his life. When I read this, in my twenties, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d have nodded hard. Here was someone who had been born in England (like me), was of Indian descent (tick), and now lived in California (I was in Montreal). OK, he wasn\u2019t an Asian female \u2013 the possibility of a woman with brown skin writing that book, at the time would have been so unthinkable as to be in the realms of of fantasy \u2013 but you can\u2019t have everything. His words went deep and I didn\u2019t feel I was on the other side of a glass wall.</p> <p>Later, I read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/04/guest-house-for-young-widows-by-azadeh-moaveni\">Azadeh Moaveni</a>\u2019s 2007 memoir <em>Lipstick Jihad: A Memoir of Growing U</em><em>p Iranian in America and American in Iran</em>. In it, she wrote: \u201cBeing a Persian girl in California, it turned out, was like, a totally different thing than being a young Iranian woman in the Islamic Republic of Iran.\u201d Here was a woman who had worked as a journalist for Time magazine in Tehran for two years. She was different (like me) and yet she had achieved this impressive career.</p> <p>Eventually, I made my own way as a travel writer. Yet, whenever I have been about to set off anywhere, I can\u2019t help but wonder: how will I be received? When travelling, I often experience what I\u2019d describe as \u201chypervisibility\u201d: it\u2019s there in the barely suppressed look of surprise I\u2019ve seen on my host\u2019s face because they\u2019ve never seen a travel writer who looks like me. In India, I have the disorientating feeling of \u2013 for once \u2013 looking the same as everyone else, and yet culturally being neither of the place, nor <em>not</em> of it. My mother cooks Indian food, though not always, my father, when he was alive, listened to Indian classical music and read Indian literature, but not exclusively.</p> <p>But there are positives too: sometimes the bonds have been formed more easily because local people don\u2019t see me as a threat to their culture \u2013 there is no whiff of colonialism, however distant. I\u2019ve noticed this on the occasions when I\u2019ve met people from indigenous cultures, for instance in Queensland, Australia, and in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/17/taliban-kalash-pakistan-afghanistan\">Kalash valleys</a> of northern Pakistan. There was a relaxed friendliness and a lack of formality, confidences shared, no deferential lowering of eyes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/11/women-nature-writing-forestry-commission-writers-in-residence\">Enchanted forests: the women shaking up nature writing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As I pursued my career, my interest became focused on landscape and nature: I\u2019ve always been drawn to the belief, common in indigenous cultures and among those of nature-based faiths, that it is possible to enter into a reciprocal and meaningful relationship with an animate nature. So when I came to write <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/26/losing-eden-why-our-minds-need-the-wild-by-lucy-jones-wanderland-by-jini-reddy-review\">Wanderland</a></em>, I set off in search of the magical across British landscapes. I had intriguing experiences in all corners of the land: in Herefordshire, for instance, with a follower of the Old Ways; on Iona in the Hebrides, when seeking a mysterious land temple; or in Sussex, following a \u201ctreasure map\u201d to hidden healing springs.</p> <p>During my year\u2019s journey around the UK I found myself compelled to explore my own experience of otherness. That feeling of being on the hard end of curiosity or suspicion or of feeling vulnerable is not unique. If you\u2019re a woman you can feel uncomfortable when a man sidles up and wants to strike up a conversation, or if you have an accent that isn\u2019t local. But your skin colour marks you out from the word go, before you\u2019ve uttered a word. You are defenceless.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8530f0561f92232ebc91ac4bd1710e1efa533f11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8530f0561f92232ebc91ac4bd1710e1efa533f11/0_355_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johny Pitts, photographed in Peckham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johny Pitts, photographed in Peckham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Do I see any of these nuances reflected in today\u2019s writing? Well yes and no. It is still a struggle to find travel literature by British authors of colour \u2013 Monisha Rajesh\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/26/around-the-world-in-80-trains-by-monisha-rajesh-review\">Around the World in 80 Trains</a> </em>(and before it, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/nov/21/india-railways-train-journeys\">Around India in 80 Trains</a></em>), Noo Saro Wiwa\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/29/looking-transwonderland-saro-wiwa-review\">Looking for Transwonderland</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/29/looking-transwonderland-saro-wiwa-review\"> </a>about her travels in Nigeria, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/30/afropean-by-johny-pitts-review\">Johny Pitts\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/30/afropean-by-johny-pitts-review\">Afropean</a></em>, and Gary Younge\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/21/travel.travelbooks\">No Place Like Home:</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/21/travel.travelbooks\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/21/travel.travelbooks\">A Black Briton\u2019s Journey Through the American South</a></em>, spring to mind. But when your interests veer towards the eco-spiritual, that thins out the field even further. Reflecting on some of the narratives that first drew me in, I think, for example, of Charlotte Du Cann\u2019s <em>52 Flowers That Shook My World</em>, Jay Griffiths\u2019 <em>Wild</em>, Eleanor O\u2019Hanlon\u2019s <em>Eyes of the Wild</em>, Eliot Cowan\u2019s <em>Plant, Spirit, Medicine</em>, and <em>Braiding Sweetgrass</em> by Robin Wall Kimmerer, a botanist and citizen of the Potawatomi Nation. I also loved Cheryl Strayed\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/aug/15/books-to-give-you-hope-wild-by-cheryl-strayed\">Wild</a></em> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/17/i-skied-solo-across-antarctica\">Felicity Aston</a>\u2019s <em>Alone in Antarctica,</em> both outdoors memoirs. (I\u2019m drawn to contemporary nature-writing by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/27/melissa-harrison-escape-to-country-at-hawthorn-time\">Melissa Harrison</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/20/what-lies-beneath-robert-macfarlane\">Robert Macfarlane</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/11/richard-powers-interview-the-overstory-radicalised\">Richard Powers</a> too.) But aside from Kimmerer, none of these authors are from marginalised backgrounds in terms of race.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/23/robin-wall-kimmerer-people-cant-understand-the-world-as-a-gift-unless-someone-shows-them-how\">Robin Wall Kimmerer: 'People can\u2019t understand the world as a gift unless someone shows them how'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are more ethnically diverse narratives. Jessica J Lee is a British Canadian Taiwanese writer and founding editor of the <a href=\"https://www.thewillowherbreview.com/\">Willowherb Review</a>, a literary journal dedicated to diversity in nature writing. In <em>Two Trees Make a Forest</em> she travels to Taiwan and traces the lives of her maternal grandparents. On my to-read list is also Elizabeth Jane Burnett\u2019s memoir <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/21/the-grassling-by-elizabeth-jane-burnett-review\">The Grassling</a></em> (her mother is Kenyan, and her father from Devon), and beyond Britain, there is Antiguan-American <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/16/featuresreviews.guardianreview19\">Jamaica Kincaid</a>\u2019s <em>My Garden</em>, Malaysian-Norwegian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/22/when-my-husband-died-mushroom-foraging-helped-me-out-of-the-dark\">Long Litt Woon</a>\u2019s <em>The Way Through the Woods</em> and British-Canadian-Japanese Kyo Maclear, who has written <em>Birds Art Life</em> from an urban perspective.

  "<p>More than 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment over the last 10 weeks \u2013 a number of jobless the US has not seen since the Great Depression.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/28/us-job-losses-unemployment-coronavirus\">US job losses hit 40m as coronavirus crisis sees claims rise 2.1m in a week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The economic impacts of Covid-19 have been far and wide, hurting virtually every industry and leaving tens of millions of people without paychecks to pay the bills.</p> <p>Here are the key numbers that tell the story of the masses of unemployed workers, and the devastating economic impact the crisis has had.&nbsp;</p> <h2>1. The national unemployment rate: 14.7%</h2> <p>The Department of Labor releases the latest national unemployment rate at the beginning of each month. In the figures for April, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/08/april-jobs-report-us-unemployment-rate\">released</a> earlier in May, the rate was 14.7%, up from 4.4% in March. While many states have begun gradual reopening processes, the figure only represents those whose claims were filed up until mid-April. Millions more have filed claims since then, though we will not know how that has affected the unemployment rate until May\u2019s figures are released in early June.</p> <h2>2. The black and Hispanic unemployment rates: 16.7% and 18.9% </h2> <p>Economists have long known that black and Hispanic Americans are the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/african-americans-unemployment-covid-19-economic-impact\">most vulnerable</a> during economic recessions, and while many workers of color are in essential jobs, the Covid-19 economic crisis has proved <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.a.htm\">no different</a>. Even at its lowest, the black unemployment rate is typically double that of white unemployment, with Hispanic unemployment not too far behind. Experts say job segregation pushes black and Hispanic workers into low-paying industries, like hospitality, that come with little to no benefits and have been hit hardest.</p> <h2>3. Percentage of unemployed Americans who are women: 55%</h2> <p>Though women make up a smaller percentage of the working population, a slight majority of people who were laid off in the last few months are women. At the beginning of May, the Department of Labor <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t01.htm\">reported</a> nearly 11.5 million women had lost jobs, compared with about 11 million men. This is no coincidence given that the industries that have been hardest-hit by shutdown orders, hospitality and leisure, education and healthcare, employ more women than others.</p> <h2>4. The leisure and hospitality unemployment rate: 39.8%</h2> <p>Last month\u2019s Department of Labor figures confirmed that the leisure and hospitality industry has been the<a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t14.htm\"> hardest-hit </a>by the economic downturn. About 4.8 million workers, the highest of any industry have lost their jobs in the industry.</p> <h2>5. State with the highest unemployment rate: Nevada</h2> <p>Nevada\u2019s unemployment rate is the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm\">highest</a> of any state at 28.2%, meaning one in four people in the state of 3 million was unemployed in April. Nevada\u2019s economy relies heavily on tourism, which brought in <a href=\"https://www.casino.org/news/nevada-tourism-industry-delivers-state-67-6b-economic-impact/\">$67.6</a><a href=\"https://www.casino.org/news/nevada-tourism-industry-delivers-state-67-6b-economic-impact/\">bn</a> in 2018. Michigan and Hawaii had the second and third highest rates with 22.7% and 22.3% unemployment, respectively.</p> <h2>6. Average unemployment insurance benefit amount: about $980</h2> <p>Pre-pandemic, the average unemployment insurance <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/how-much-unemployment-will-i-get-that-depends-on-your-state.html\">check</a> was about $380. But because each state is in charge of its own unemployment system, and sets the amount that is given in unemployment insurance, it varies widely. Some states give about a fifth of a person\u2019s paycheck while others give half or more. To compensate for the widespread differences, those who successfully file for unemployment are given an extra $600 a week through the end of July with money Congress set aside in its massive coronavirus stimulus package in March. While this means some are still barely making ends meet, others are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/25/unemployment-benefits-600-renewal-republicans\">getting more</a> than they were getting in the jobs they were laid off from.</p> <h2>7. Highest number of unemployment claims in one week: 6.6m</h2> <p>Between 29 March and 4 April, 6.6 million Americans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/us-unemployment-filings-coronavirus\">filed</a> for unemployment, a staggering number that signaled the true depths of the economic crisis.</p> <h2>8. Number of households deemed food insecure: 1 in 5</h2> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/05/06/the-covid-19-crisis-has-already-left-too-many-children-hungry-in-america/\">analysis</a> by the Brookings Institution found one in five households in the US were deemed food insecure by the end of April. Food banks have seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/us-food-banks-over-budget-demand-coronavirus\">shortages</a> in light of increased demand as millions of families struggle to pay for groceries. The analysis found the situation is worse for families with children: two in five households with mothers and children under the age of 12 are food insecure.</p> <h2>9. Number of gig workers unemployed: more than 6.1m</h2> <p>In its latest stimulus package, Congress included a federal <a href=\"https://edd.ca.gov/about_edd/coronavirus-2019/pandemic-unemployment-assistance.htm\">program</a> that allows self-employed workers and contractors to receive unemployment benefits. In its <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf\">unemployment report</a> last week, the Department of Labor said that 6.1 million Americans who classify as self-employed were receiving unemployment insurance. </p> <h2>10. Percentage of low-wage workers unemployed: 40%</h2> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200513a.htm\">remarks</a> given on 13 May, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, delivered a shocking statistic from a Fed survey: 40% of households making under $40,000 a year lost a job in March. \u201cThis reversal of economic fortune has caused a level of pain that is hard to capture in words,\u201d Powell said.</p>",
  "<p>The number of Americans who have lost their jobs in the past 10 weeks soared to more than 40 million as the number of unemployment claims continued to rise with 2.1 million people filing for unemployment last week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/us-unemployment-figures-jobs-lost-coronavirus\">US unemployment rises by 2.4m despite easing of coronavirus lockdowns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The staggering job losses mark a grim milestone in the economic crisis that has gripped the US since the coronavirus triggered widespread shutdowns and stay-at-home orders in an effort to halt the spread of the deadly pandemic.</p> <p>The latest figures from the Department of Labor show that the rate of new unemployment claims has continued to fall over the last few weeks, down from its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economy\">peak</a> in early April, when 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment in a single week.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the department <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/08/april-jobs-report-us-unemployment-rate\">reported</a> that more than 20 million Americans lost their jobs in April, bringing the unemployment rate to 14.7%, up from 4.4% in March.</p> <p>While the growth of unemployment claims has slowed, millions more have continued to file for unemployment each week, bringing the total number of unemployed to a disastrous rate not seen since the Great Depression.&nbsp;</p> <p>Job losses have hit virtually every <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t14.htm\">industry</a>, though some harder than others. Figures from the Department of Labor earlier this month showed the leisure and hospitality industry was the hardest-hit, with 4.8 million jobs lost \u2013 nearly a 40% unemployment rate \u2013 as traveling came to a halt with shutdown measures. Millions of education and health services, retail and manufacturing jobs were also cut.&nbsp;</p> <p>Even months after shutdown orders were put in place, the reported unemployment figures may not show a complete picture of how many people were laid off due to the crisis.</p> <p>Many states are still trying to work through backlogs of thousands of applications as antiquated online systems struggle to keep up with the number of applicants. Oregon, for example, <a href=\"https://katu.com/news/local/oregon-employment-dept-program-works-on-38000-claim-backlog\">announced</a> this week that it is still trying to process 38,000 unemployment claims. At the end of April, only a third of claims in Hawaii, a state that relies heavily on its tourism industry, had been <a href=\"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/04/27/breaking-news/less-than-one-third-of-hawaiis-unemployment-claims-have-been-paid-since-march-1/\">processed</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>After Jazz Salm was laid off from her job as a server at Chile\u2019s, she immediately got onto Florida\u2019s unemployment system to file her claim. It took her about a week to get through the system since the website kept crashing. When she was finally able to submit her claim, it took another month until she started receiving payments.</p> <p>During that month, Salm, who lives in Sarasota, had no idea what the status of her application was. Having just used her savings to move in February, Salm was left without money to pay her bills or even buy groceries until payments came in.</p> <p>\u201cI think the government just needs to realize that we just want to be heard,\u201d Salm said. \u201cIt all comes down to acknowledgement that us little people \u2013&nbsp;you know, what are we supposed to do? We\u2019re stuck.\u201d</p> <p>Over the last few weeks, all 50 states have begun some type of reopening measures, bringing hope that the economy will revive as people start going back to work. But it is unclear what effect the measures have had on unemployment.&nbsp;</p> <p>The majority of the 20 million Americans \u2013 about 78% \u2013 who filed for unemployment in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/08/april-jobs-report-us-unemployment-rate\">April</a> indicated they were temporarily laid off, meaning they expected to be called back to their jobs after the pandemic.</p> <p>But many businesses that have reopened are operating with far-from-normal procedures, like social distancing in dine-in restaurants and movie theaters, that mean foot traffic is still down compared with pre-shutdown times. Many local businesses have had to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/12/small-business-used-define-americas-economy-pandemic-could-end-that-forever/\">shutter permanently</a>, probably leaving tens of thousands of Americans unemployed indefinitely.</p>",

It willingly ravages the lungs of any American, regardless of their skin color or visa status.</p> <p>But as America passes the 100,000 death mark, it has become abundantly clear that the pandemic amounts to a racial disaster of stunning proportions. Figures compiled by <a href=\"https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race\">APM Research Lab</a> from 40 states show that African Americans are being killed at almost three times the rate of white people.</p> <p>Black Kansans are <a href=\"https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race\">seven times</a> more likely to die from the virus than white Kansans.

Hansi Flick grinned that he was \u201csatisfied with him in every training session and every game,\u201d though player and manager hinted the latter had the idea to try a lob, pointing out Roman B\u00fcrki\u2019s habitual position off his line.

It would be churlish to skim too much credit from the midfielder\u2019s visionary moment but, having got a hand to it, B\u00fcrki must have felt great disappointment in not being able to save. The Swiss goalkeeper should not be hung out to dry but it was perhaps him, and Dortmund under Lucien Favre, in microcosm. Very good (and B\u00fcrki has been one of his team\u2019s outstanding players in the past two years) but not quite elite.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Much of the focus on Favre after the match was on him casting doubt on his future. A reporter asked if he was capable of taking the team on to the next level and Favre enigmatically replied he would explain his views further \u201cin a few weeks\u201d.</p> \n<p>What was perhaps more noteworthy was the arm around the shoulder he offered his team, arguing \u201cwe played well, better than against Wolfsburg or Schalke\u201d.

The leaden displays of Emre Can and Jadon Sancho, two usually sure-fire gamechangers whose second-half introductions instead caused Dortmund\u2019s tempo to plunge, underlined how fitness problems tied the manager\u2019s hands when it came to the crunch. A change would not, however, be out of kilter with the prevailing breeze of a season in which Favre has already survived hairy moments.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That scent of nearly but not quite has always clung to Favre\u2019s Bundesliga career. Judging him, or anyone, against this magnificent Bayern is not entirely even-handed. For even in smothering hopes of a thrilling run-in, the champions have already offered plenty to savour.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Talking points to follow after Wednesday\u2019s matches.<br></h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Favre \u2013 who pugnaciously clarified his words on Wednesday, telling Sky \u201cI will fulfil this contract,\u201d which runs to June 2021 \u2013 will be grateful for the small mercy of RB Leipzig dropping more home points, which means BVB retain second place. Julian Nagelsmann called the damage \u201cself-inflicted\u201d in the 2-2 draw with Hertha, but that overlooks how much the Berliners have grown in just three games under Bruno Labbadia. \u201cWe wanted to win and the opportunities were there,\u201d said Labbadia, and they were after Krzysztof Piatek\u2019s penalty salvaged a draw following Rune Jarstein\u2019s horror slip from Patrik Schick\u2019s tame shot for the hosts.</p></li> \n <li><p>It\u2019s Leverkusen who slip out of the incredibly tight top four race for now after a scarcely-believable 4-1 slump at home to Wolfsburg \u2013 which could have been way worse but for Lukas Hradecky\u2019s performance between the sticks. Die Werkself\u2019s tepid display was \u201cunacceptable\u201d according to the Finnish goalkeeper, and Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach retook fourth despite only drawing at lowly Werder Bremen. Leverkusen have a quick chance to recover \u2013 they\u2019re at Freiburg on Friday night.</p></li> \n <li><p>It goes from bad to worse for David Wagner and Schalke, who extended their winless run to ten. They slumped to defeat at Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf after taking the lead via Weston McKennie\u2019s header - Uwe R\u00f6sler\u2019s team scored twice in five minutes from set-pieces to reignite their survival hopes. Wagner\u2019s decision to hook Rabbi Matondo for defender Jean-Clair Todibo in the closing stages, pushing centre-back Salif San\u00e9 up front, is garnering significant criticism for the under-fire coach.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/tables/league/625\"> \n <table data-embed-type=\"table\"

  "<p>My dad and his family grew up in a tin humpy on the banks of the Namoi River in Walgett, New South Wales. My grandmother worked on a station, raising the station manager\u2019s children, and never received her pay during her lifetime.</p> <p>Growing up my father was denied an education and instead given a football; he left school at 15 and later in life was drafted with five other Aboriginal men to play rugby league for the Gundagai Tigers. That year Gundagai saw their first grand final win. Gundagai loved Dad until he retired from football and needed a job.&nbsp;</p> <p>My journey towards becoming a business owner started standing on the Gundagai overpass, waving goodbye to my father as he hitchhiked for work, as no one wanted to employ an Aboriginal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/i-was-told-as-an-aboriginal-i-could-get-alternative-access-to-uni-so-my-results-wouldnt-matter\">I was told as an Aboriginal I could get alternative access to uni, so my results wouldn\u2019t matter | Michael O\u2019Loughlin for IndigenousX</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Our family\u2019s experience of economic exclusion across generations is, sadly, not uncommon. The result of this widespread exclusion is reflected in disparities in health, education and employment. Today, despite owning or have controlling interests in some 40% of the Australian land mass, First Nations people continue to be excluded from not just the economy but the conversation regarding this country\u2019s future.&nbsp;We continue to live in a system that reinforces the status quo and refuses to recognise the benefit offered to all Australians in embracing Aboriginal people, culture and knowledge systems.&nbsp;</p> <p>I have dedicated my career to improving the lives of First Nations people. I worked in remote communities across the Northern Territory within Aboriginal organisations, at both state and national levels, influencing policy, and, recently, within the private sector. During this time, I witnessed firsthand the systemic barriers that maintain the cycles of disadvantage and poverty. At the same time have also seen the only assets Aboriginal people own, that have the ability to break these cycles, exploited by non-Indigenous people.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2019 I established Guumali, a social enterprise that works to create opportunities that support First Nations people to take part in the economy.&nbsp;Guumali recognises the importance of independent economies in enabling our communities to thrive. Through our work we hope to support Aboriginal land and sea owners in realising the full potential of their resources and knowledge systems in a way that reinforces overall wellbeing and cultural values.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26593b4d7c041176d5c2eb7b262dcea279d510db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26593b4d7c041176d5c2eb7b262dcea279d510db/0_167_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sorrell Ashby\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sorrell Ashby</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To date, most economic development on Aboriginal land and sea has focused on benefiting a third party and not Aboriginal communities directly. When Aboriginal people and enterprises are represented in supply chains, it\u2019s usually in the initial stage before a product\u2019s full value is reached, such as the picking, gathering or collecting of a product. While some people and communities are happy with this model of participation, many are calling for a new approach to Aboriginal economic development \u2013 one that sees Aboriginal people and business represented across the entire supply chain.&nbsp;</p> <p>For this to happen we must challenge the current approach which is built on a western framework. At Guumali we want to see an approach where Aboriginal people and their systems, including their language, culture, and traditional decision making processes, are the heart of economic development rather than on the sidelines.<strong> </strong>We believe in building genuine partnerships between the private sector and Aboriginal communities that sees both business and community succeed.&nbsp;</p> <p>Today investors want to engage directly with Aboriginal land and sea owners, and we are more than capable of doing so without the middlemen. For thousands of years Aboriginal people in this country have operated systems of trade.</p> <p>From as early as the 1700s Aboriginal tribes from Arnhem Land to the Kimberley traded with Macassan fishermen who sought trepang (sea cucumber). It wasn\u2019t until the 20th century that this was blocked by the Australian government. Today, unless you can buy back/lease one of the three trepang fishing licences owned by Tasmanian Seafoods, Aboriginal people are prohibited from traditionally harvesting trepang for direct commercial gain.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/07/we-dont-know-how-long-covid-19-will-impact-the-market-scene-but-were-ready-for-business\">We don't know how long Covid-19 will impact Meeanjin Markets but we're ready for business | Leesa Watego for IndigenousX</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This example of the structural barriers and the role that colonisation has played in our exclusion demonstrates the need for reform at the very foundations of the system. For this to happen we require courageous leadership that must take the conversation beyond the comfort zones of government and business. Leadership that recognises the benefit to all Australians in allowing equal participation of First Nations people in this country\u2019s future.&nbsp;</p> <p>While the memory of waving goodbye to my father on the bridge is still painful today, I hope to use this as a force for good, ensuring that our family\u2019s experience is something we as a country learn from, not deny. I truly believe that as a society there is nothing to lose from our inclusion, only an opportunity to gain.</p> <p>So in the spirit of reconciliation week I take this opportunity to invite you to walk on this journey with us, to start the conversation, to encourage participation and to hold our leaders accountable.
