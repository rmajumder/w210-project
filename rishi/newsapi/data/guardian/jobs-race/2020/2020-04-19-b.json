  "<p>Good morning, this is Emilie Gramenz bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 20 April.</p> \n<h2>Top stories</h2> \n<p><strong>People on lower incomes are twice as likely to lose their jobs due to coronavirus restrictions in Australia, according to new research. </strong>The Grattan Institute has warned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/lower-income-earners-more-likely-to-lose-jobs-due-to-coronavirus\">higher earners are safer than lower earners</a>, with restrictions impacting a range of service industries that mainly employ women and young people.

  "<p>Welcome to the main stage of our weekly Drag Race recap! Last week, we saw some memorable Madonna musical mayhem, and New York queen Brita was sent home. Now here\u2019s another hour of madness and another controversial elimination. And when we say \u201ccontroversial\u201d, we mean it made a few people post that picture of Britney spears crying on Twitter.</p> <p>Let\u2019s go!</p> <h2>Workroom</h2> <p>Jan\u2019s frustrated at being overlooked by the judges last week and we don\u2019t blame her. It\u2019s good that she\u2019s venting, though. Sadness and frustration are valid emotions that we should not be afraid to show. Interestingly, the editing is painting it as her being fake. HMMMM.</p> <p>After a few weeks of forgetting about them, RuPaul\u2019s suddenly remembered the concept of mini-challenges again! Interestingly and, surely by chance, that\u2019s coincided with sponsorship by a company called Fab Fit Fun. How fortuitous. Ru pairs the ladies up to create gift boxes for each other, and present them in the shadiest way possible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fa9bb60b251869306b94f7cff730c3fc23e5770e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa9bb60b251869306b94f7cff730c3fc23e5770e/53_1_613_368/500.jpg\" alt=\"Drag Race\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jackie Cox and Gigi Goode blew away the competition in the mini-challenge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VH1</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019re obsessed with Jackie Cox and Gigi Goode\u2019s looks and facial expressions. They rightly win. But mostly this challenge is just product placement, thinly veiled behind inane entertainment. Not that we blame the show, that\u2019s how capitalist society works. Welcome to television!</p> <h2>Droop</h2> <p>For this week\u2019s main challenge, the queens are tasked with creating and selling a unique product to sell for fictional drag lifestyle brand Droop (somewhere in Beverly Hills, Gwyneth Paltrow just threw a piece of organic seagrass at her television). It\u2019s supposed to be high-class and upper echelon. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how to spell echelon!\u201d says Heidi.</p> <p>Ru does a walkaround with health and fitness guru and \u201cbranding expert\u201d Bob Harper. We\u2019ve never seen him before but we wouldn\u2019t trust him to look after our house plants for a day, never mind help us sell a product. Actually maybe that\u2019s not fair. We like his shirt.</p> <p>Jan\u2019s product is called \u201cSure, Jan.\u201d 10/10. She expresses again that she was sad to see Brita go and Bob says \u201cit\u2019s not RuPaul\u2019s best friend\u2019s race!\u201d Shut up, Bob!</p> <p>There\u2019s a great detailed story behind Jackie Cox\u2019s magic carpet concept and we\u2019re looking forward to it \u2013 the first Farsi he saw spoken on TV was in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9L4NVc4HJo\">I Dream of Jeannie</a>, so this is something of a tribute. We can\u2019t remember the last time we saw a contestant go from <em>meh</em> to exciting so quickly.</p> <p>They only get 20 minutes each to shoot the commercial - in television terms, that is a ridiculously short amount of time. Usually commercial shoots take hours at least, often days. Gigi\u2019s concept is great but she\u2019s not giving very much. Whereas Jan is giving us a headache. And Jaida\u2019s giving us anxiety with that glass of red wine on that nice white sofa. Heidi\u2019s putting the lotion in the basket. It\u2019d go lovely with Jaida\u2019s nice chianti \u2026</p> <h2>Take it to the runway</h2> <p>This week\u2019s theme is BLACK WEDDING. According to our sources, the ladies aren\u2019t supposed to wear all-white outfits on the stage \u2013 something to do with lighting or green screening or something. Hence why there\u2019s been a lack of bridal/wedding challenges. A great idea to do it in black though.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/feelinggoode_/status/1251437622376849410\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">no thoughts. head empty. just crystal methyd&#39;s black wedding look <a href=\"https://t.co/ST26yjWdJN\">pic.twitter.com/ST26yjWdJN</a></p>&mdash; maddie \ud83c\udf42 (nsfr) (@feelinggoode_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/feelinggoode_/status/1251437622376849410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 18, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Our celebrity guest judge this week is the legendary Chaka Khan. No surprises there. She\u2019s opened more prides than you\u2019ve opened new browser tabs! She\u2019s stunning in a bohemian shiny look. RuPaul stalks down in a gorgeous ornate Ming-dynasty-esque creation. Michelle smouldering in all black. Ross Matthews is there too.</p> <p>Jackie Cox\u2019s look isn\u2019t great. Jan\u2019s is gorgeous. Gigi blows the judges (and us) away in a smoky homage to Christian Dior, casually paired with some Louboutins. This is the most fashion-forward we\u2019ve seen Heidi. Ru\u2019s \u201cherses\u201d joke is actually very good. Crystal\u2019s dead bride look is beautiful too.</p> <p>Ross Matthews says Gigi\u2019s commercial was clunky and we completely disagree. It was hilarious. \u201cHi \u2026 I\u2019m better than you!\u201d as an opening line is hard to beat. Amazing. Perhaps this is the difference between British humour and American humour. We like subtle and cutting, they like bold and brash. They might also be pretending it\u2019s bad because Gigi\u2019s done WAY too well this season, and it\u2019s never fun if there\u2019s a glaringly obvious winner from only halfway through.</p> <p>We\u2019re a bit worried about Chaka Khan. Are you ok, Chaka? Widow\u2019s commercial is awkward. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/leighsyvie/status/1251320662679072768\">Crystal\u2019s is great</a>, as she rocks her real life mullet for most if it. If only they could\u2019ve got the rights to Dua Lipa\u2019s Physical in the background.</p> <h2>Lipsync for your LIFE</h2> <p>Jan and Widow are lipsyncing to This Is My Night by Chaka Khan, who looks like she\u2019s trying to work out where she is. Widow gives an involved, quite beautiful performance and Jan, as usual, is giving 50,000%. It\u2019s too much.

  "<p>Even by the standards of 1970s rock\u2019n\u2019roll, it was in bad taste: a billboard on Sunset Boulevard of a bruised and bound woman sitting on a gatefold cover of a new Rolling Stones album that proclaimed: \u201cI\u2019m \u2018Black and Blue\u2019 from the Rolling Stones \u2013 and I love it.\u201d</p> <p>The 1976 advert triggered an outcry: <a href=\"https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/schlesinger-library/exhibition/until-safety-guaranteed\">Women Against Violence Against Women (WAVAW)</a> wrote in the <a href=\"http://digital.lib.uh.edu/collection/feminist/item/3208/show/3188\">newsletter</a> <em>Breakthrough</em> that the ad campaign \u201cexploits and sensationalises violence against a woman for the purpose of increased record sales\u201d and \u201ccontributes to the myth that women like to be beaten, and condones a permissive attitude towards the brutalisation of women.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1c097430c23d411697cac42e93a5b590cb2f7ff2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c097430c23d411697cac42e93a5b590cb2f7ff2/0_0_1280_1716/746.jpg\" alt=\"Black and Blue controversial advert\" width=\"746\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The controversial advert for the Rolling Stones\u2019 Black and Blue album from 1976, featuring the model Anita Russell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Atlantic Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Five women connected with the group \u2013 \u201carmed with buckets of fire-engine-red paint\u201d, according to the magazine <em>Mother Jones</em> \u2013 defaced the hoarding, writing \u201cThis is a crime against women.\u201d The band\u2019s label, Atlantic Records, pulled the campaign. The band apologised. By way of an explanation, Mick Jagger said he\u2019d applied the simulated bruises himself.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mind at all, in fact I was happy for the work,\u201d model Anita Russell told the <em>Observer</em> last week on the 44th anniversary of the album\u2019s release and the <a href=\"https://therollingstonesshop.com/collections/half-speed-masters\">impending reissue </a>of much of the band\u2019s later back catalogue, remastered at Abbey Road using a technique for extracting more sound from the original mastering tapes. <em>Black and Blue</em> is one of <a href=\"https://www.superdeluxeedition.com/news/rolling-stones-reissue-half-speed-mastered-vinyl-editions-of-ten-albums/\">10 albums being reissued</a> and, not surprisingly, it will not be accompanied by the original ad campaign.</p> <p>Russell recalls that she hadn\u2019t expected to get the booking. At a casting with Jagger and <a href=\"https://www.artbook.com/9788862081207.html\">photographer Ara Gallant</a> in New York, Russell passed the part-African-American model <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/models/a16102/pat-cleveland-on-conquering-racism-to-become-the-first-black-supermodel/\">Pat Cleveland</a> on the stairs and felt sure she\u2019d get it. \u201cMick told me I was too pretty, so I smeared my makeup and said, \u2018See, I\u2019m not so pretty.\u2019 Then he told me to put my arms up and told me to make a face like I\u2019m growling.\u201d</p> <p>Days later, Russell, Jagger, Keith Richards and Gallant got together to make the picture. \u201cI knew about \u2018I\u2019m black and blue from the Rolling Stones\u2019, and I knew that the bruises meant I\u2019d been beaten and tied. But I wasn\u2019t a model who could only pose and look pretty, and I wasn\u2019t insulted because I knew it was tongue-in-cheek,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Russell, who is now an equestrian and author, recalls that the musicians were charming and polite. \u201cI\u2019m an actress-model, so it seemed like fun,\u201d she adds. \u201cI never thought of it in a negative way.\u201d Jagger asked her out. She demurred. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get passed around from star to star, but I thought he was cuter than in his photographs.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wasn\u2019t a model who could only pose and look pretty, and I wasn\u2019t insulted because I knew it was tongue-in-cheek</p> <footer> <cite>Anita Russell, model</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the ad came out just as French <em>Vogue</em> published a <a href=\"https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/helmut-newton-1920-2004-saddle-i-paris-5054075-details.aspx\">Helmut Newton picture</a> of a woman wearing a bridle and saddle, amplifying the controversy. Russell played along with the outrage: she posed for a <em>National Lampoon</em> magazine cover imagining Jagger tied up, with Russell looking on, laughing.</p> <p>Close to half a century on, <a href=\"https://ultimateclassicrock.com/rolling-stones-black-and-blue-ad/?utm_source=tsmclip&amp;utm_medium=referral\">the billboard ad stands as a turning point</a>. WAVAW <a href=\"http://uclacsw.blogspot.com/2013/06/from-june-mazer-lesbian-archives-wavaw.html\">organised a boycott</a> of Warner, Elektra and Atlantic Records lasting three years, which was only lifted after Warner Communications agreed to let the group implement a sensitivity training programme for advertising executives at the entertainment giant. There was a riposte a year later when the punk band X-Ray Spex released <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogypBUCb7DA\">Oh Bondage Up Yours!</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://populismblog.wordpress.com/about-2/\">Evelyn McDonnell,</a> author of <em>Women Who Rock: Bessie to Beyonce. Girl Groups to Riot Grrrl</em> theorises that the campaign brought some attention to the album but ultimately overshadowed it. \u201cIt certainly didn\u2019t let the music speak for itself, and the controversy doesn\u2019t age well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhile<a href=\"http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/WarZoneChaptIVA.html\"> Andrea Dworkin</a> and Women Against Violence might have seemed like radical fringe feminism then, that reaction is mainstream now. A record company just wouldn\u2019t allow it nowadays. It would be<em> </em>cancel culture<em>,</em>\u201d McDonnell says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cc4378dfc967551fbc2aa232936da894ee1a5a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cc4378dfc967551fbc2aa232936da894ee1a5a3/28_48_4622_2264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Rolling Stones album cover for their 1976 Black and Blue album.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"490\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rolling Stones\u2019 album cover for their 1976 Black and Blue album.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rajko Simunovic/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She points out \u2013 notwithstanding the fact that women, too, have played extensively with the iconography of bondage and fetishism, from the Plasmatics\u2019 Wendy O Williams to Shakira <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pILCn6VO_RU\">throwing off her ropes </a>during February\u2019s Super Bowl half-time show \u2013 that equality, real or symbolic, wasn\u2019t always forthcoming in the business.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than it was.
