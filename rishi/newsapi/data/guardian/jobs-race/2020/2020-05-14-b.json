  "<p>Household finances face a serious impact in the wake of the coronavirus shutdown, economists have warned, as loss of earnings, falling house prices and job insecurity combine to reshape the economy in a way not experienced by Australians for decades.</p> <p>Official figures released on Thursday showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/unemployment-rate-in-australia-jumps-to-62-due-to-covid-19-as-600000-jobs-lost\">unemployment had risen to a \u201cshocking\u201d 6.2%</a> in April, and with the jobless rate likely to rise until one in 10 Australians are out of work, a fundamental shift is occurring in the economy.</p> <p>Although the reported rise in unemployment was not as bad as some expected (more than 8% was the consensus figure) and there remains hope for a swift recovery, the loss of income marks a serious blow to the economy.</p> <p>Craig James, chief economist at Commsec, said the fall in jobs masked the future loss of income for many Australians and he suggested that the government might have to extend its jobkeeper wage programme and other handouts to keep people afloat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/06/toilet-kitchen-sydney-studio-apartment-rent-surry-hills-australia\">Room with a poo: the tiny Sydney apartment for rent with a toilet in the kitchen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPeople have lost income and there is little hope for a lift in wages in the months ahead,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cAdd in the deferral of dividend payments by listed companies and little or no interest income and there may be scope for \u2018top up\u2019 cash handouts by the government.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/australian-housing-market-takes-a-huge-hit-with-auctions-set-to-plummet-further-this-weekend\">Falling house prices</a> are another threat to the financial outlook for many households when added to loss of incomes, with the Commonwealth Bank issuing a worst-case scenario on Wednesday that could see 32% lopped off the average value of a home. The prediction was in line with similar war-gaming study from NAB, although the Commonwealth\u2019s base-case is for prices to drop 11% over the next three years.</p> <p>Analysts at UBS said on Thursday that almost half of Australia\u2019s workers are on wage subsidies, 10% of homeowners are deferring payment of their mortgages and 15% of small businesses are deferring loan repayments.</p> <p>If the economy has not returned to normal when the \u201cadrenaline hit\u201d of subsidies ends in the spring, households and business face a crunch point along with the nation\u2019s banks.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the extent of the downturn it is probable that many corporates and households will fail,\u201d UBS analysts said.</p> <p>Economists at JP Morgan believe Australians lack enough \u201crecession experience\u201d because last time the country endured a slump, which was in 1991, a majority of current population (62%) had yet to reach adulthood.</p> <p>So rising unemployment, loss of income and falling house prices \u201cwill<strong> </strong>induce greater change in household behaviour\u201d and higher saving and lower borrowing will replace the debt splurge that has characterised Australian household finances.</p> <p>\u201cIn the absence of strong incomes growth, both of these factors imply a lower long-term rate of household consumption growth,\u201d says Sally Auld of JP Morgan, who also throws into the mix falling immigration, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/australia-china-trade-tensions-raise-fears-over-future-of-agricultural-exports\">a worsening relationship with China</a> and higher government debt.</p> <p>However, there was cause for optimism in some quarters with Cameron Murray, research fellow specialising in property and resources at the Henry Halloran Trust at the University of Sydney, arguing that house prices could weather the storm created by the pandemic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2020/apr/30/rental-affordability-snapshot-proves-australias-coronavirus-welfare-payments-should-stay\">Rental affordability snapshot proves Australia's coronavirus welfare payments should stay | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He believed it was plausible that prices could rise 5% over the next 12-18 months because of investor demand buoyed by ultra-low interest rates that, as JP Morgan forecasts, will remain in place for some time to come.</p> <p>\u201cIf buyers are back, if banks lend at less than 3% to investors, if foreign buyers come back, if government comes in with more stimulus for first-time buyers, then prices will come back,\u201d says Murray.</p> <p>While rising prices do little to help those who might be hoping for a drop in prices to enable them to buy themselves, it was also possible the crisis and sustained levels of interest rates below 3% could shift the balance towards buying rather than renting in some cases.</p> <p>Pete Wargent, a buyer\u2019s agent, agreed and noted that although the unemployment numbers were \u201cterrible\u201d the correlation between rising unemployment and lower house prices was weak.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the early 90s recession and the aftermath of the GFC you can see that prices went up. One reason is that rates tend to be low. You can now get a loan for 2.19% and that is going to tilt the balance to where it\u2019s cheaper to buy than to rent in some cases.</p> <p>\u201cThe top end will be hit by lack of confidence and borrowing capacity but lower end might be ok if the government comes in with more stimulus.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It has been two months since Breonna Taylor was sleeping in her apartment on the south side of Louisville, Kentucky, when plainclothes police officers arrived outside her door in the early hours of 13 March.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/ahmaud-arbery-georgia-prosecutors-under-investigation\">Ahmaud Arbery: prosecutors under investigation over handling of killing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Across the country, many people were starting to work from home as the grip of coronavirus quickly spread.<strong> </strong>But Taylor, a 26-year-old certified EMT, was an essential worker, still going to help at two Louisville hospitals as the city braced for the worst.</p> <p>\u201cShe had no regard for her health when it came to helping others,\u201d said lawyer Ben Crump in a virtual press conference on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the tragedy is it wasn\u2019t coronavirus that killed Breonna Taylor. It was police officers that were being reckless and irresponsible and shooting from outside the house, shooting through windows. They don\u2019t do this in other neighborhoods.\u201d</p> <p>With officials and the media largely distracted by the coronavirus pandemic, the police killing of Taylor, who is African American, largely escaped widespread scrutiny. Taylor\u2019s family and friends called for justice, rallying outside downtown Louisville\u2019s court complex in March, but they gained little momentum.</p> <p>That changed after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">the release of a video showing the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery</a> \u2013 a black jogger who was confronted and gunned down by a white father and son. More attention is being paid to Taylor\u2019s death as eyes are once again drawn to the epidemic of young black Americans being gunned down by cops and fellow civilians alike.</p> <p>Crump, who also represents the Arbery family, has previously been involved in other high-profile cases of African American shooting victims including Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Tamir Rice.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the California senator and former presidential candidate Kamala Harris <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1260629289529233408\">called for the Department of Justice to investigate Taylor\u2019s killing.</a></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It wasn\u2019t coronavirus that killed Breonna Taylor. It was police officers that were being reckless and irresponsible</p> <footer> <cite>Ben Crump</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kentucky\u2019s governor, Andy Beshear, called reports about Taylor\u2019s death \u201ctroubling\u201d and called for a review into the results of the police investigation \u201cto ensure justice is done at a time when many are concerned that justice is not blind\u201d.</p> <p>On the night that Taylor was killed, the officers were serving a no-knock search warrant in a narcotics investigation. Police have since said the officers knocked and announced themselves before entering.</p> <p>Lawyers for Taylor\u2019s family and her boyfriend Kenneth Walker, who was with Taylor that night, say they did not. Walker said he thought he was witnessing a home invasion, prompting him to pick up his gun and fire a shot that hit an officer in the leg after a battering ram plowed through the apartment\u2019s door.</p> <p>Police responded by firing more than 20 times. Taylor was hit by eight rounds. According to an affidavit filed by Walker\u2019s defense lawyer Rob Eggert: \u201cYou could look through one of the bullet holes and see into the next-door apartment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was incredible that Ms Taylor was the only one killed,\u201d he added later in the document.</p> <p>No drugs were found. Taylor died. Walker was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of a police officer and first-degree assault. Three officers involved were reassigned pending an investigation.</p> <p>In a suit against three Louisville police officers involved in the shooting, lawyers for Taylor\u2019s family accuse the police of negligence, excessive force and wrongful death. Additionally, they said police were searching for a suspect who had already been apprehended and that police lacked probable cause. In firing their weapons \u201cblindly\u201d, lawyers wrote, police showed \u201ca total disregard for the value of human life\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBreonna had posed no threat to the officers and did nothing to deserve to die at their hands.\u201d</p> <p>An affidavit for a search warrant obtained by the Guardian on Wednesday described how police had observed a car regularly operated by two suspected drug dealers make \u201cfrequent trips\u201d from a drug-dealing \u201ctrap house\u201d near the city center to Taylor\u2019s home, more than 10 miles away.</p> <p>According to the warrant, police believed one of the suspected dealers, Jamarcus Glover, was keeping either drugs or drug money in Taylor\u2019s home.</p> <p>In applying for the warrant for Taylor\u2019s apartment, police requested permission for a no-knock entry \u201cdue to the nature of how these drug traffickers operate\u201d.</p> <p>Lawyers for Walker and Taylor say neighbors in the building can attest that police did not knock or announce themselves.</p> <p>A Louisville police spokesperson did not respond to questions from the Guardian about how officers executed the search warrant.</p> <p>The police department often releases video captured by body-worn cameras after police-involved shootings. But the officers involved in serving the warrant on Taylor\u2019s home do not wear body cams.</p> <p>\u201cIf this was another community, another household in a more affluent community, lightning would strike and thunder would groan\u201d if such a warrant were issued, Crump said.</p> <p>Walker, Crump said, believed the police \u201cwere committing a home invasion. Don\u2019t African Americans have the right to the second amendment? He was trying to protect Breonna. He was trying to protect himself.\u201d</p> <p>After a judge released Walker to home incarceration in late March, the president of the River City Fraternal Order of Police \u2013 which represents Louisville police officers \u2013 called the decision \u201ca slap in the face to everyone wearing a badge.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Louisville Corrections Fraternal Order of Police called Walker <a href=\"https://www.wave3.com/2020/03/27/judge-releases-man-who-shot-officer-during-deadly-confrontation-weeks-ago/\">\u201can attempted cop killer\u201d</a> when he was released.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, Walker\u2019s attorney Eggert said: \u201cGiven the facts of the case, they ought to dismiss the case against Kenneth Walker.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/los-angeles-coronavirus-inequality-undocumented-healthcare\">No insurance, no savings, no support: what happens when LA's least privileged get Covid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Christopher 2X, an anti-violence activist in Louisville, said Taylor\u2019s killing would be a setback to a relationship between African Americans and police in Louisville.</p> <p>\u201cThat one shooting \u2013 and then when it doesn\u2019t get the proper response from those in city government \u2013 can be the thing that knocks the dominoes down,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In Kentucky, Taylor\u2019s death has spurred calls for a thorough investigation from Louisville\u2019s mayor, as well as the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and the Democrats vying to face him in November\u2019s election.</p> <p>On Tuesday, a Democratic Senate candidate, Mike Broihier, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeForKY/status/1260372287578144774\">tweeted</a>: \u201cIf you\u2019re African-American in this country, you can be killed by police, or ex-police, or wannabe-police, and people will say you were \u2018no angel.\u2019 As an EMT, Breonna Taylor saved lives.

Sainz will be expected to play a support role to Leclerc, who Ferrari are now firmly backing as their No 1 driver, but both will have a role in what the team see as a long-term process.

Is this something state governments should be really buying into as a former state premier yourself?<br></p> \n  <p><strong>KK: </strong><br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well first of all I can understand why the Queensland government is interested in seeing Virgin with its 16,000 employees, and the services it provides regional communities, including in Queensland, I can understand why they\u2019re keen to see that airline survive. </p> \n   <p>I have to say though I\u2019m quite puzzled by Peter Dutton\u2019s ongoing and somewhat obsessive commentary about what is happening in the Queensland government. It might be worthwhile if Peter Dutton remembers that he has a day job that is to be the minister for home affairs in the government of Australia. I mean to look at his Twitter feed and his public commentary, you think he\u2019s moonlighting as the opposition leader there in Queensland. </p> \n   <p>I\u2019m not sure if that is the job he really wants, but it would be important for him to do his day job, particularly when we see the 22<sup>nd</sup> death from the Ruby Princess. </p> \n   <p>In fact, the deaths from the Ruby Princess if you count the north-west Tasmanian outbreak, which seems to have been linked as well to the Ruby Princess, are over 30. It accounts for 10% of Australia\u2019s coronavirus cases. I suppose if I was Peter Dutton I wouldn\u2019t talk about my day job either.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T06:39:22.337Z\">at 7.39am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebce2848f080c727453a9bc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T06:18:07.283Z\">7.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>When I asked for the earth to open up and swallow me during question time, this is not what I meant. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/abcadelaide/status/1260815913172885509\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BREAKING</a>: Geoscience Australia has detected an earthquake that has been reported as being felt near Burra, South Australia. <a href=\"https://t.co/GrHWI7TVOU\">pic.twitter.com/GrHWI7TVOU</a></p>\u2014 ABC Adelaide (@abcadelaide) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/abcadelaide/status/1260815913172885509?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 14, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebce19a8f08d99d46a169c1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T06:17:18.269Z\">7.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Trent Zimmerman </strong>is on the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing \u2013 and he remains on the \u2018increase Newstart\u2019 train.

That\u2019s an unemployment rate equal to 15% of the adjusted labour force.</p> \n   <p>However, to get a true picture of unemployment, we also need to account for the big drop in hours of those who did work. <strong>Average monthly hours for those still employed fell by 7 hours per worker for the month of April, or by 5%.

He\u2019s not eligible for jobkeeper because he\u2019s a casual with less than 12 months\u2019 experience and his future contract is not taken into account. Why has the government left Scott and 600,000 other Australians behind?</p> \n  <p><strong>Frydenberg:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, Mr Speaker, we have absolutely taken Scott into account with a doubling of the effective Newstart and the $550 jobseeker coronavirus supplement, Mr Speaker. At $1,100, this is effectively a doubling of that safety net that was previously in place. Now, Mr Speaker, as ... the honourable member will know, some six million Australians are now covered by the businesses that have formally enrolled for the payment, together with the jobkeeper payment, together with the 1.6m that are on the jobseeker payment. </p> \n   <p>We\u2019re talking over half the Australian workforce. </p> \n   <p>But I could also let the honourable member know through the PM\u2019s work, through the national cabinet, the work of the premiers and the chief ministers, they\u2019ve set out a three-stage framework for lifting restrictions. </p> \n   <p>Treasury have forecast that the benefit to the economy, and to jobs, from lifting those restrictions, based on the health advice, will be some 850,000 jobs and $9.4bn to the economy. </p> \n   <p>Now, in relation to those, who work in the arts and the recreation sector, if those three stages are followed through, 76,000 jobs will be created, or people will get back to work in that particular sector. When you look at opening pubs, cafes, and other entertainment venues and other venues you\u2019re looking at a $2.4bn dividend to Australia. </p> \n   <p>We know we needed to put in place temporary, targeted, proportionate measures in response to the biggest economic shock that Australia has ever seen. A $320bn or 16.4% of GDP \u2013 this is a very substantial requirement, as is required at this very difficult time. </p> \n   <p>But there are stories right across this country, some that I\u2019ve repeated in in House today and yesterday, where our jobkeeper program and our jobseeker program are saving lives and livelihoods.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c62c57dee3f143a02839be0f9d9a79b6f65d1d14\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c62c57dee3f143a02839be0f9d9a79b6f65d1d14/0_230_4714_2830/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prime pinister Scott Morrison and treasurer Josh Frydenberg during Question Time in the House of Representatives.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prime minister Scott Morrison and treasurer Josh Frydenberg during Question Time in the House of Representatives.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T05:00:48.674Z\">at 6.00am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebccba08f080c727453a938\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T04:41:17.232Z\">5.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>David Littleproud</strong> took a dixer on drought management and came up with their furphy:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The next drought starts the very first day after it stops raining.
