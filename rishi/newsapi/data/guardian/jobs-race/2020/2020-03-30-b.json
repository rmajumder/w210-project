  "<p>Does the huge surge in US unemployment claims announced on Thursday mean that we are doomed to endure the 30% unemployment of which the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis has <a href=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2020/march/back-envelope-estimates-next-quarters-unemployment-rate\">warned</a>?</p> <p>The answer is no. How high unemployment rises will depend on how quickly we ramp up <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/status/1243186636814417921\">testing and the provision of protective equipment</a>, enabling us to determine when and where it is safe to return to work.</p> <p>But early evidence on the ability of countries like the US and UK to roll out tests and protective gear is not heartening. It\u2019s not too early, therefore, to start worrying about how sky-high unemployment will affect our economies and societies.</p> <p>In one scenario, the crisis will foster support for strong leaders who can issue strict directives and enforce them by any means necessary. We have seen how China, under President Xi Jinping, was able to lock down Wuhan, limit mobility and contain the coronavirus (for now). We have also seen how the crisis encourages identity politics \u2013 how President Trump uses it to justify his xenophobic tendencies. We have seen how the crisis breeds nationalism, as countries close their borders and prohibit exports of medical equipment, and as international groupings like the G20 blow hot air.</p> <p>These same reactive instincts were evident in the 1930s, the last time unemployment approached 30%. The role of unemployment in the rise of authoritarian figures like Hitler is disputed, but the most recent <a href=\"https://voxeu.org/article/financial-crisis-and-right-wing-extremism-germany-1931-33\">research</a> suggests a link. There was economic nationalism, in the form of trade wars, and the political nationalism of the American aviator and aspiring presidential candidate Charles Lindbergh, now conveniently <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plot_Against_America_(miniseries)\">visible on the small screen</a>. There was Oswald Mosley\u2019s antisemitism. <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/great-depression-repatriation-drives-mexico-deportation\">There was the harassment and deportation of Mexican Americans, including even hospital patients, </a>by the Los Angeles welfare department and US Department of Labor.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If ever there was a circumstance suited to rehabilitate experts and encourage respect for politicians who defer to them, this is it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But there is also a more hopeful scenario. Authoritarian leaders don\u2019t like bad news, which they tend to suppress, sometimes at cost to themselves. One hears about rumblings of a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/business/china-coronavirus-internet-police.html\">backlash</a> against Xi and his minions for having clamped down on news of the virus, thereby putting China at risk. Trump may similarly end up paying a price for having <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-outbreak.html\">suppressed warnings </a>from his own Department of Health and Human Services. If ever there was a circumstance suited to rehabilitate experts and encourage respect for politicians who defer to them, this is it.</p> <p>In the extreme, one can imagine the crisis pounding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-ronald-reagan\">the last nails into the coffin of the Thatcher-Reagan revolution</a>. The idea that government should divest itself of its equity stake in essential infrastructure has already been abandoned, in Britain in the case of the railways and in the US, prospectively, the airlines. Old shibboleths about the need for budget balance and austerity have gone by the board. We are experiencing the most vivid possible reminder that the private sector, charitable bodies and local government alone <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/us/politics/swabs-for-coronavirus-testing.html\">can\u2019t be relied on for essential services.</a> They can\u2019t even be relied on for an adequate supply of testing swabs, the Trump White House, no less, having organized a military airlift of these last week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/29/how-us-government-works-coronavirus-pandemic\">A shutdown - but not for government: how US federal employees provide vital services</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These are the same realizations, it can be argued, that gave <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/brave_new_world/welfare.html\">rise to the New Deal in the 1930s and the </a><a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/brave_new_world/welfare.html\">Beveridge Report in 1942</a>, which created a very different social, economic and political order than existed before.</p> <p>The transformation may not be as dramatic this time. Even if unemployment rises to Depression levels, it can come back down quickly with medical mitigation and support from fiscal and monetary policies. The latter have been primed much more rapidly than in the 1930s. Measures to prevent bankruptcies and bank failures are being rolled out faster. Basic support for households is being provided through direct payments to taxpayers, expanded unemployment benefits, and grants to employers who avoid layoffs. All this might be thought to diminish the likelihood of a radical social and political realignment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ultimately, it was national security that begat social security</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But it was not just high unemployment that led to the welfare state, the mixed economy and more expansive government. In addition, it was the second world war and the realization that national security, even national survival, required shared sacrifice, and that public support for those who sacrificed was a necessary and appropriate quid pro quo. The Beveridge Report that created the British welfare state was a product of not just the 1930s but also of the second world war. The GI bill that expanded opportunities for education and homeownership for Americans was similarly a legacy of the war. Ultimately, it was national security that begat social security.</p> <p>Boris Johnson has vowed that \u201cwe must act like a wartime government\u201d. Donald Trump insists that he is a wartime president. If fighting the virus is indeed a battle tantamount to war, then the legacies of these politicians and the attitudes and values of their successors may turn out rather differently than they currently expect.</p> <ul> <li><p>Barry Eichengreen is the George C Pardee and Helen N Pardee professor of economics and professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Episode five! We\u2019re well into season 12 at this point. There\u2019s no escape now. The helicopter has left the island. Laura Dern\u2019s hyperventilating in a generator room.

While we\u2019re on this very tenuous metaphor that\u2019s really just giving an excuse to deliver Jurassic Park lines, imagine RuPaul, in full drag, saying \u201cDinosaur EATS man \u2026 WOMAN, inherits the earth!\u201d A Jurassic Park movie with drag queens <em>has</em> to happen. Someone get Universal on the blower. It\u2019s not like they\u2019ve got any other franchises.</p> <p>Excitingly, at this point in the season, we can probably start referring to this as a \u201cdeep dive\u201d. Or at least, a deep dip.

Tut, tut.</p> <h2>Pineapple tears</h2> <p>Brita gets straight in there with the digs, saying she can\u2019t believe Aiden \u201cdid the bare minimum and skated by again\u201d. Cut to Aiden frowning, cue shady camera angles, cue tension-inducing rattlesnake noise. This is clearly the friction producers wanted on the show. It\u2019s just a shame Rock had to take the fall for it. We\u2019d like to state for the record that we are not saying this is definitely why Rock left, or that the show is in any way pre-determined.

It\u2019s home to his iconic black and yellow cottage that everyone posts photos in front of on Instagram. Aiden\u2019s Dungeness tattoo might be a reference to something else, but we wouldn\u2019t be AT ALL surprised if it was a Jarman reference. She\u2019s that girl. We knew she was.</p> <h2>Workroom</h2> <p>Jackie Cox\u2019s boy look is FANTASTIC! She looks like she should be wafting through flower gardens and pergolas with Margaery Tyrell. Julius Caesar wishes. The girls are standing around a table discussing which one of them is hottest out of drag. Jaida nominates herself, of course. Heidi says \u201cJan would be trade if she still had her boy brows!\u201d and everyone SCREAMS with laughter. Calm down everyone. It was a pithy comment, sure, but it wasn\u2019t that funny.</p> <p>RuPaul enters the workroom wearing a long white coat \u2013 ushering in a rather unfortunately timed medical themed set of challenges. The minichallenge is, it\u2019s fair to say, fairly minima \u2013 select a pill bottle from a tray, whoever gets one with a pink pill gets final say in who plays which part in the main challenge. Yes, another acting challenge. In the immortal words of that woman talking about general elections on BBC News \u2026 NOT ANOTHER ONE!</p> <h2>Gay\u2019s Anatomy</h2> <p>It\u2019s a drag parody of Shonda Rhimes never ending mega-hit. Look, they had no way of knowing we\u2019d all been on medically recommended lockdown with thousands dying worldwide. It\u2019 ain\u2019t their fault. Gigi and Nicky are in charge of casting and they give Aiden the role of \u2026 THE GHOST. Casting brilliance. To Gigi and Nicky\u2019s credit, this genuinely doesn\u2019t seem to be coming from a mean place. But for Aiden, this will be a jagged little pill to swallow.</p> <p>In her rehearsal scenes, Heidi honestly seems like she\u2019s on a different planet. Heidi \u2018N\u2019 Closet is the energy we all need to carry forward over the next few weeks \u2013 she\u2019s got relentless positive energy, she amuses herself, she uses everything at her disposal to bring joy and she\u2019s wearing a t-shirt that says \u201cI am my history\u2019s hopes and dreams\u201d paired with some marijuana print leggings. We say this every week but \u2013 we are in love.</p> <p>Jackie Cox says that when she was a kid her mum tasked her with bringing stool samples to the lab she worked in.

If this all culminates is Nicky being eliminated, je t\u00e9l\u00e9phone \u00e0 la police.</p> <h2>Sisterhood</h2> <p>A touching insight into Jackie\u2019s relationship with her mum, and the nuances of being from an immigrant family in the US (or perhaps to some degree, from an immigrant family anywhere). But that\u2019s somewhat upstaged when we learn that Widow\u2019s mum died in a car crash. She speaks candidly about how she was never able to come out to her and it\u2019s heart-rending. The girls gather round to comfort her.</p> <p>We\u2019ve said it before but we\u2019ll say it again; this season has put far more emphasis on sisterhood and solidarity, perhaps taking a leaf out of the UK version\u2019s book. It\u2019s a much better look for the show and god knows it\u2019s a lesson we all should heed right now.</p> <h2>Sissy that walk</h2> <p>RuPaul looking drop dead gorgeous in a sparkly lime green ensemble, with curvier curves than she usually goes for, but it\u2019s working! Carson\u2019s fun and fresh in a shiny blazer. We like Carson. Michelle\u2019s laughing maniacally. And guest judge Normani \u2026UGH! GORGEOUS!

  "<p>Donald Trump has extended America\u2019s national shutdown for a month, bowing to public health experts, and scientific reality, and warning that the worst of the coronavirus pandemic is yet to come.</p> \n<p>Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, the US president claimed that, if his administration keeps the death toll to 100,000, it will have done \u201ca very good job\u201d \u2013 a startling shift from his optimistic predictions of a few days ago when he said he hoped to restart the economy by Easter.</p> \n<p>Trump also undermined his plea for unity by uttering falsehoods, verbally abusing reporters and making incendiary allegations that implied health care workers were stealing masks, without providing evidence.</p> \n<p>The extended deadline marked a humiliating retreat for the president who, having squandered six precious weeks at the start of the pandemic, more recently complained that the cure is worse than the problem and floated Easter Sunday as a \u201cbeautiful timeline\u201d for reopening big swathes of the country.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/bankers-trump-economy-coronavirus-deaths\">Ignore the bankers \u2013 the Trump economy is not worth more coronavirus deaths | Robert Reich</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On Sunday he claimed this had only been \u201caspirational\u201d as his advisers urged him not to move too hastily. He announced the initial 15-day period of social distancing urged by the federal government, which was due to expire on Monday, would be extended to 30 April, and said he hoped normality might return by 1 June.</p> \n<p>The guidelines recommend against big group gatherings and urge older people and anyone with existing health problems to stay at home. People were also urged to work at home when possible and avoid restaurants, bars, non-essential travel and shopping trips.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe modelling estimates that the peak in death rate is likely to hit in two weeks,\u201d Trump told reporters, with the toll already at more than 2,400. \u201cNothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won. That would be the greatest loss of all.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cWe can expect by June 1st we will be well on our way to recovery.\u201d</p> \n<p>The shift came as the full horror of the pandemic appeared to dawn on a president who long downplayed it. Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/anthony-fauci-coronavirus-death-toll-200000-americans\">the US could experience more than 100,000 deaths</a> and millions of infections. Fauci praised the extension as a \u201cwise and prudent\u201d decision.</p> \n<p>Trump cited projection models that said potentially 2.2 million people or more could have died had the country tried to \u201cwing it\u201d and not put social distancing measures in place. \u201cI kept asking and we did models,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are 2.2 million people would have died.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd so, if we could hold that down, as we\u2019re saying, to 100,000 \u2013 it\u2019s a horrible number, maybe even less, but to 100,000, so we have between 100 [thousand] and 200,000 \u2013 we altogether have done a very good job.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc3edb62b031987ed45b23ac64c29889998a4207\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc3edb62b031987ed45b23ac64c29889998a4207/0_83_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Health care workers stand outside a tent erected to test people for the Covid-19 at the Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Health care workers stand outside a tent erected to test people for the Covid-19 at the Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, New York City.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Kelly/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump also appeared to have been rattled by scenes at Elmhurst Hospital where he grew up in Queens, New York. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching that for the last week on television,\u201d he said. \u201cBody bags all over, in hallways.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been watching them bring in trailer trucks, freezer trucks, they\u2019re freezer trucks, because they can\u2019t handle the bodies, there are so many of them. This is essentially in my community, in Queens; Queens, New York. I\u2019ve seen things that I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump had minimised the threat of the coronavirus for weeks and ignored the pleas of his health secretary to investing in testing kits and breathing apparatus. The House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union this attitude had cost American lives. \u201cThe president, his denial at the beginning, was deadly,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7980e706-ca5a-4fb0-adcc-bbbb3260644c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_lsb_gYPPrc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump has long been criticised for refusing to own up to his own mistakes and shifting blame to others. In another lengthy, abrasive press conference, he pushed a conspiracy theory speculating that hospital staff may be stealing N95 masks and selling them on the black market.</p> \n<p>The current demand does not square with what hospitals usually use, he told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s a New York hospital, very \u2013 it\u2019s packed all the time. How do you go from 10 to 20 [thousand masks per week] to 300,000? Ten [thousand] to 20,000 masks, to 300,000 \u2013 even though this is different? Something is going on, and you ought to look into it as reporters. Are they going out the back door?\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cHow do you go from 10,000 to 300,000? And we have that in a lot of different places. So somebody should probably look into that, because I just don\u2019t see from a practical standpoint how that\u2019s possible to go from that to that.\u201d</p> \n<p>When a reporter asked the president to clarify, he asked for New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio to investigate, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s hoarding. I think it\u2019s maybe worse than hoarding.\u201d</p> \n<p>The comments provoked widespread outrage. Joe Kennedy III, a Democratic Congressman from Massachusetts, tweeted:<em> \u201c</em>We need supplies. We need masks. Our frontlines are suffering. Suggesting otherwise is disgusting.\u201d</p> \n<p>Joe Biden, the front runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, said: \u201cThis is ridiculous and completely false. Today\u2019s conspiracy mongering from our president is among the most reckless and ignorant moves he has made during this crisis, and there have been many.
