  "<h2>Top story: Call to extend job retention scheme</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray with you once again this morning. Let\u2019s set the controls for the heart of the news \u2026</p> \n<p>The UK government\u2019s plan to subsidise workers\u2019 wages should be extended until at least autumn, the trade body for the human resources sector has argued. Peter Cheese from the CIPD said extending the scheme until at least September would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/29/extend-coronavirus-wage-subsidies-or-risk-delayed-redundancies-firms-warn\">prevent the job retention scheme becoming a \u201cwaiting room\u201d for eventual redundancy</a>. The CIPD is calling on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, for urgent changes including allowing furloughed staff to work reduced hours. There are early signs the furlough scheme is working, with more than 4m positions protected following the first week of its operation. Extending it could add \u00a312bn a month to the cost to the exchequer, according to the Resolution Foundation.</p> \n<p>British Airways has set out plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/british-airways-plans-to-make-up-to-12000-staff-redundant\">make up to 12,000 of its staff redundant</a> because of the global collapse in air travel. Its chief executive, Alex Cruz, has told the airline\u2019s 42,000 staff that it \u201cmust act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future\u201d. The UK\u2019s flag carrier has placed 22,600 people on the government\u2019s furlough scheme and the CEO wrote to staff that it \u201ccannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely \u2026 Yesterday, British Airways flew just a handful of aircraft out of Heathrow. On a normal day we would fly more than 300.\u201d Unions have reacted with shock and anger to the announcement.</p> \n<p>The number of US cases has passed one million as Donald Trump predicted an economic rebound in the fall and claimed there would soon be 5m coronavirus diagnostic tests a day. An international row has erupted as the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, backed calls for an investigation of the origins and spread of the novel coronavirus.
