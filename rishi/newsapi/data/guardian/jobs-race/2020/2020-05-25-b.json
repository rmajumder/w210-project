  "<p>They say a week is a long time in politics. In rugby league, two months may as well have been an eternity, such has been the seismic change the game has undergone since the season kicked off in early March.</p> <p>Covid-19, of course, threw the world into a type of chaos many have not experienced and now, on the eve of the NRL\u2019s resumption, it almost seems nostalgic to look back on the way the game was run, covered, broadcasted and talked about in the fledgling days of 2020.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/25/nrl-targets-1-july-for-crowds-to-return-to-stadiums\">NRL plan for return of crowds dependent on medical advice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since then, the league has endured: organisational inertia at NRL HQ; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/14/nrls-plan-to-start-games-by-end-of-may-is-ambitious-says-scott-morrison\">outspoken opposition in the corridors of power</a>; broadcasters who wouldn\u2019t pay; players who baulked at a pay cut; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/19/nrl-referees-rule-out-strike\">referees who threatened industrial action</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/29/trust-in-players-evaporates-after-april-fools-put-nrls-resumption-at-risk\">players who flouted social distancing rules</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/14/bryce-cartwright-granted-medical-exemption-from-flu-shot-and-will-play-nrl-season\">anti-vaxxers who had the potential to stop a return</a>; and the typical rugby league bickering that has felled so many in the past.</p> <p>Yet the NRL will on Thursday become the first major Australian sports league to resume since the coronavirus shutdown. And the game is not where it is today because it flowed with the current of the worldwide pandemic; it is where it is today largely, if not solely, due to one man \u2013 Peter V\u2019landys.</p> <p>Both feared and revered in equal parts, the ARLC chairman is a belligerent populist whose brand of working class fire-and-brimstone rhetoric and results-first ethos has positioned rugby league as the frontrunner through sheer force of will \u2013 and him as the most powerful man in Australian sport.</p> <p>For good or ill, V\u2019landys has bulldozed a path for the game\u2019s return and to label him one of the most omnipotent figures in Australia is not hyperbole. He has defied the prime minister and state premiers, taken the fight to broadcasters and unions, unilaterally changed the laws of the game and obliterated rivals along the way.</p> <p>V\u2019landys was twice chastised by Scott Morrison for declaring the Warriors would be given a travel exemption, yet they set up camp in Tamworth and will play on Saturday. It has been a high-risk gambit. Governments can and will shut the game down the moment there is a health breach. Failure to have the backing of health departments and public officials gives the game zero wiggle room if something goes wrong. A thirst for brinksmanship and risk has its downside and his making, of course, could yet be his breaking. </p> <p>V\u2019landys may be able to control the narrative through cozy media relationships but any single health failing could bring the game to its knees; the game will not go on if any player tests positive for Covid-19. To keep some stakeholders in line, some obvious safety measures like player hubs have been foregone. It is a dangerous ploy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d45ad8191ed28a2a8282a86a3e13affd8c14c91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d45ad8191ed28a2a8282a86a3e13affd8c14c91/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former NRL CEO Todd Greenberg and ARLC chair Peter V\u2019landys\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former NRL CEO Todd Greenberg (left) and Peter V\u2019landys.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt King/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rugby league has historically struggled to understand the machinations of power and politics. It has too often cowered when confronted or deferred, confused and bewildered by the intrigue and subtleties involved in money and influence. </p> <p>That has made the internal difficulties in the game look a complete mismatch. Former CEO Todd Greenberg was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/todd-greenbergs-cards-were-marked-once-peter-vlandys-landed-in-rugby-league\">not expected to last long</a> when V\u2019landys assumed the chairmanship of the ARLC. Covid-19 actually gave him a stay of execution but V\u2019landys does not suffer fools gladly. Greenberg is no fool, but when he made a mess of the player pay negotiations and was humiliated in the broadcast discussions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/20/nrl-ceo-todd-greenberg-quits-amid-rugby-league-coronavirus-crisis\">the chairman was both decisive and brutal</a>.</p> <p>Neither of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/20/nrl-broadcast-deal-with-nine-and-fox\">NRL\u2019s two broadcast partners</a> made a critical payment on 1 April but Fox Sports has signed on to a long-term deal ensuring the immediate viability of the game while Nine, who were clearly angling to leave their deal, look set to extend.</p> <p>The players were always going to be the hardest stakeholders to both please and corral. V\u2019landys won the support of RLPA CEO Clint Newton, keeping any player discontent individualised and nothing more than a murmuring. Anti vaxxers were not publicly humiliated as they well could have been but it became clear that they would not be allowed to stop the game returning. While the completely inadequate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/28/nathan-cleary-third-nrl-player-investigated-for-breaching-coronavirus-restrictions\">response from the NRL</a> to social-distancing laws by four players was widely condemned, it does appear tactical to keep the support of both players and clubs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/06/nrl-island-recipe-for-ruin-or-a-world-leading-game-changer\">NRL Island: recipe for ruin or world-leading game-changer? | Larissa O'Connor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The approach to the referees was both more direct and significantly heavier. A rule nobody had called for \u2013 the six-again rule designed to speed up play \u2013&nbsp;was introduced with little time to prepare while the game reverted to a single referee. Despite a commitment to pay all full-time referees, the idea of industrial action was floated. V\u2019landys responded by claiming plans were already in place to cope without them and he conceded nothing before the officials committed to refereeing the full 2020 season. The rule and the refereeing change smacks of hubris and has the ability to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/14/nrls-aims-may-be-noble-but-rule-changes-leave-season-without-integrity\">completely undermine the legitimacy of the 2020 season</a>.</p> <p>Rugby league has beaten other sports back because at its helm is a pragmatist who cares little for principle.

It is an attitude which has seen the game plough on regardless of advice otherwise. </p> <p>But streaks do not last forever and messiahs do not exist. Fallibility is human and at some stage, V\u2019landys may pull the wrong rein. And if he does, the stakes are so high it could be devastating. For now though, rugby league is set to return, albeit a markedly different version to what we knew a few months back.</p>",
  "<p>Jenny Botting was working as a receptionist in 2012 while she applied for PhD programmes in animal cognition. \u201cI realised I needed more field research, so I applied to be a volunteer at a monkey research station in the middle of the South African bush.\u201d She left Aberdeen in January 2013, but it was three months before she met Arend Van Blerk, who was volunteering at the same station. \u201cWhen I arrived, Jenny was away on a holiday,\u201d he says. \u201cShe came back on a Saturday night and the volunteers all had a party together. There were about 15 of us living there.\u201d She remembers that he was \u201chandsome and smiled a lot\u201d.</p> <p>Over the course of the next week, the pair worked hard during the day, following the monkeys around the bush in KwaZulu-Natal and recording their behaviour for the research project. In the evenings, Jenny stayed up late to speak to him. \u201cI was so tired from getting up at 4am for work, but I pretended I wasn\u2019t so I could spend time with Arend,\u201d she says. He felt the same way. \u201cI thought she was really attractive but we also shared a lot of interests. She was silly in a cute way and I really enjoyed talking to her.\u201d</p> <p>The pair had their first kiss at the volunteers\u2019 Saturday night party a week after they met. They spent the next few months together before Jenny moved back to Scotland to start her PhD at the University of St Andrews. \u201cIt was the first time we were going to be apart and it all felt so uncertain,\u201d says Arend. They kept their relationship going long distance and the following April, Jenny got the chance to return to South Africa for field research. \u201cAs part of my PhD, I went back every April for the next few years. It meant I could spend more than half the year with Arend doing research there,\u201d she says. During the winters, they spoke on the phone whenever they could.</p> <p>In September 2016, Jenny was offered a two-year research post in the US at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo in Washington DC. \u201cIt was really hard because it meant we had to be apart for longer,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it was my dream job.\u201d The couple were used to long-distance love by this point, and travelled together when they got the chance. \u201cThe first time I travelled long-haul was to see Jenny in the UK in 2016. One of the things I love about our relationship is that she has opened my eyes to seeing the world,\u201d says Arend. During her time in the States, he went to visit the zoo she was working at. \u201cI got to introduce him to my orangutans and gorillas,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are both so passionate about animals and working with them.\u201d</p> <p>Jenny moved back to South Africa in June 2018 to live with Arend, their cat and three dogs. \u201cWe love scuba diving, hiking and taking regular game drives together,\u201d she says. They got engaged in February this year. \u201cI actually proposed on Valentine\u2019s Day in the Cape of Good Hope. We don\u2019t usually celebrate it and I\u2019d actually forgotten it was that day,\u201d laughs Arend. Straight after the proposal they ran into a group of baboons. \u201cIt made it extra special, although it might reinforce the fact that our lives seem to revolve around animals,\u201d jokes Jenny. After that she came back to see her family and friends in Windsor. \u201cThe pandemic hit while I was here and the South African borders were closed so we are living apart again.\u201d Despite the current challenges, the pair hope to marry \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.</p> <p>Jenny says she loves Arend\u2019s sense of humour and his kindness towards people and animals. \u201cHe\u2019s so brave. I once saw him climb into a tree to save a black mamba. I love how he cares for all animals equally, whether it\u2019s a tiny bug or an elephant.\u201d Arend appreciates his partner\u2019s passion and bravery. \u201cIf she sees something bad happening, she\u2019ll always address it,\u201d he says. He also loves their differences. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown up in different environments and it\u2019s great to get another perspective. Whatever happens, she can always make me feel better.\u201d</p>",

In Wisconsin, the supreme court chief justice, Patience Roggensack, was criticized in early May after <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/chief-justice-condemned-for-blaming-coronavirus-spread-on-meatpackers-2020-5\">she seemed to downplay</a> a coronavirus outbreak among workers at a meatpacking facility in Brown county, where a large proportion of the workers are minorities and immigrants.</p> <p>\u201c[The surge in coronavirus cases] was due to the meatpacking \u2013 that\u2019s where Brown county got the flare,\u201d Roggensack said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the regular folks in Brown county.\u201d</p> <p>Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of the Wisconsin-based <a href=\"https://vdlf.org/\">Voces de la Frontera</a> immigrant-rights group, criticized Roggensack\u2019s remarks as \u201celitist\u201d and \u201cracist\u201d, and told the Guardian that Latinos had been subjected to \u201clegalized discrimination\u201d through their work.</p> <p>\u201cWithout a question they have been discriminated against, because they are disproportionately more vulnerable to exposure and to having them or their families or their community impacted by the Covid-19,\u201d Neumann-Ortiz said.</p> <p>If there is one positive, Neumann-Ortiz said, it\u2019s that the backlash could trigger a greater effort to change workplace conditions.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s forcing workplace organizing to happen, in a way that wasn\u2019t there before because the stakes are so high,\u201d Neumann-Ortiz said. In some cases workers have refused to go to work due to unsafe conditions, which has forced companies to temporarily close down facilities to deep-clean plants, or provide better PPE.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a new struggle on the frontline and it\u2019s going to be here for a while to come,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>There is no escape for me this time. The rear axle of my pick-up truck is wedged on a boulder protruding from the mud in the middle of a deserted backwater road in Michigan. I\u2019ve tried to attach a winch to a nearby tree to pull myself out, but it\u2019s not working. I will have to abandon the vehicle, fit up another and try again. This load of timber is not going to deliver itself.</p> <p>I am playing Snowrunner, the latest in a series of painstakingly authentic offroad delivery simulator games in which players have to haul goods through a variety of unforgiving landscapes at speeds that would shame a garden snail. Before each trip you have to select exactly the right vehicle for the job, fit the correct tyres and work out your likely fuel consumption to the nearest millilitre. On the frozen roads of northern Alaska, there is no room for shoddy planning.</p> <p>Over the last five years there has been a renaissance in serious job simulator games. Titles such as Euro Truck Simulator, Bus Simulator and Train Sim World have attracted huge fanbases and critical acclaim, each replicating its profession with unremitting attention to detail. In an entertainment sector where ludicrous power fantasies rule, where players get to be space marines, ancient warrior princesses and football superstars, it seems antithetical that 25 million people have bought Farming Simulator, a game in which your main challenge is to harvest a successful wheat crop.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1be1253700acdb10ec312591a5c70651a359ea9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1be1253700acdb10ec312591a5c70651a359ea9/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bus Simulator 18.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Devoted following \u2026 Bus Simulator 18.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Astragon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it is the very precision of these games that has attracted such a devoted following. \u201cThroughout development we gather a lot of questions,\u201d says Julian Mautner at Stillalive studios, the team behind the Bus Simulator games. \u201cWhen you turn the ignition key once, which functions of the bus actually work, and which icons on the dashboard light up? What happens afterwards when you turn it into second position? These are the details our players really care about.\u201d</p> <p>According to Mautner, the studio has a partnership with its local transport company, IVB (Innsbrucker Verkehrsbetriebe), which they regularly visit to inspect real-life buses and take hundreds of pictures. \u201cWe also talk to the bus drivers about their everyday challenges, about special situations or tricky manoeuvres they had to execute,\u201d he says. \u201cThat provides us with immensely valuable insights into the workings of a transportation company.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In an unpredictable world, it is calming to open the doors of a bus at the right time, to give the correct change</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, the coders accurately simulate all aspects of engine performance \u2013 gear changing, torque, acceleration \u2013 using information from manufacturers. The audio team makes more than 1,000 recordings of sounds from all around different buses. The artists recreate interiors exactly. As Mautner explains: \u201cNowadays we aim to get actual 3D data for the cockpits, because replicating the details from images and blueprints often led to small inaccuracies that the community noted.\u201d</p> <p>The landscapes are vitally important, too. With truck and train driving simulators much of the appeal is the scenery that whizzes past as you\u2019re hauling goods from Berlin to Bonne, or driving a Great Western train to Cornwall. \u201cReal-world references are essential for the world creation,\u201d says Ondrej Dufek, a project leader at SCS Software, the creators of Euro Truck Simulator and American Truck Simulator. \u201cGoogle Earth, Maps and Street View are a vital tools and sources of photo references. On YouTube, there are also videos from truckers who drive across various states and countries, commenting on their surroundings and pointing out interesting stuff. Information about elevation, economy, industries, markets, traffic density, freight routes, weather, even demographics \u2013 everything is important and helps us decide what roads and cities to put in our world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b68e9a0e6643b945bf921ecd981e8d188e6d022\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b68e9a0e6643b945bf921ecd981e8d188e6d022/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Train Sim World\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not just for pernickety obsessives \u2026 Train Sim World.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dovetail Games</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSometimes we\u2019ll take photos straight against a wall so our artists can see what kind of brick is being used,\u201d says Matt Peddlestone, a senior producer at Dovetail Games which makes Train Sim World. \u201cAs you go down a route, the supplier of the brick changes because the bricks are being made locally and the colours of the building will change. We want to capture that.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to think of hardcore sim fans as pernickety obsessives, but there is a quiet joy in interacting with these lovingly replicated systems of lights, switches and signals. In an unpredictable world, it is calming to open the doors of a bus at the right time, to give the correct change, to set the heating system correctly, to obey the traffic signs. It is gratifying to see a button, to press it and to know something will happen.</p> <p>\u201cI play simulators because by their nature they are internally consistent,\u201d says fan Melissa Harper. \u201cIf you\u2019re playing a game and you\u2019re in a cockpit, and you can\u2019t press all the buttons, that absolutely slaughters the experience for me. But in Microsoft Flight Simulator, you <em>can</em> press all the buttons, and they <em>all </em>do something. That\u2019s SO satisfying, and then you can learn what they all do.\u201d</p> <p>Her favourite example is the ultra hardcore Stormworks: Build and Rescue, where you run your own sea rescue service. \u201cIt\u2019s the most brutal game I\u2019ve ever played,\u201d she enthuses. \u201cYou have to make the whole plane yourself \u2013 and all those hundreds of buttons? You have to place them by hand! The developers just toss you into a ridiculously complicated editor and say, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s only aircraft propulsion and electrical engineering, how hard could it be? F*** you.\u2019 It is my favourite game.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d43e8c8036bee5d5778da570086daca1a2874c63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d43e8c8036bee5d5778da570086daca1a2874c63/56_57_1688_1013/1000.jpg\" alt=\"First build your own aircraft \u2026 Stormworks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">First build your own aircraft \u2026 Stormworks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Green Man Gaming</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All the simulation developers I spoke to know that some of their players are professionals in the field being simulated.

Train Sim World lets players drive historical trains and journeys, which has allowed retired drivers to rediscover routes they once travelled every day. Fishing: Barents Sea Simulator was inspired by the life of co-creator Goran Myrland\u2019s grandfather, a fisherman in 1950s Norway. \u201cHe owned a classic boat just like the Follabuen, which is in our game,\u201d says Yasemin Hamurcu, COO at Misc Games. \u201cHe spent months with his crew on the rough sea to find the best catch, to earn money and provide for his family. His wife always worried about him, hoping he would come home safely.\u201d</p> <p>I have friends who drive for hours in Euro Truck Simulator, using the game\u2019s real in-game radio app to pick up local stations. For me, Snowrunner has been almost hypnotic \u2013 it\u2019s given me longer to take in the scenery, to get the feel of rural North America. Many players aren\u2019t here for the authenticity of the equipment of the simulation minutiae; they\u2019re here to experience a landscape in their own way, in their own time. A slow and steady escape.</p>"
