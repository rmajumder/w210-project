  "<p>George Floyd\u2019s name is now known around the globe; his death has sparked protests from Berlin to Mexico City. The extraordinary cruelty of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\" title=\"\">his killing</a> has shocked the world. But his death has resonated so widely not because it was exceptional, but because it was not. Not exceptional in the US, where the toll of African Americans who have died at police hands is long and shameful. And not, unfortunately, exceptional elsewhere.</p> <p>Tens of thousands gathered at the weekend in London, Manchester, Cardiff, Glasgow and other parts of the UK. In Bristol, protesters toppled a statue of slave trader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/27/bristol-city-slave-trader-edward-colston\" title=\"\">Edward Colston</a>. But the movement has also brought people on to the streets in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires; in Abuja and Nairobi; in Barcelona, Copenhagen and Paris. These marches express solidarity and outrage that the richest and most powerful country in the world should continue to treat its people this way. Demonstrators oppose the racial legacy it embodies, and the brutal, militarised police response to protests.</p> <p>But though they honour the African American experience, they also recognise the commonality of black struggles elsewhere, and more broadly the fight for human rights. The words \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d are chillingly familiar. In Australia, they evoke the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/family-of-david-dungay-who-died-in-custody-express-solidarity-with-family-of-george-floyd\" title=\"\">David Dungay</a>, an Indigenous man who uttered those words 12 times as he was restrained by prison guards. In Britain, they were cried out by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/26/deportation-escorts-training-safter-restraint-methods-jimmy-mubenga\" title=\"\">Jimmy Mubenga</a> as security guards pinned the deportee to his plane seat.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK is not innocent,\u201d read one placard at a London protest, invoking both its present and past. Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/11/lets-end-delusion-britain-abolished-slavery\" title=\"\">prefers to remember</a> its abolition of the slave trade to its role in industrialising slavery. It finished paying the bill for reparations to slave owners only five years ago. Many people still see empire as a conduit for the spread of cricket and railways. A broader curriculum, which is surely needed, would reveal it as a system of exploitation and white supremacy, with repercussions felt to this day.</p> <p>BAME people <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/bame-deaths-in-police-custody\" title=\"\">die disproportionately</a> as a result of the use of force or restraint by police, but not one officer has been convicted of manslaughter or murder in decades. Protesters in the UK have highlighted the shooting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/mark-duggan\" title=\"\">Mark Duggan</a>, the Metropolitan police\u2019s growing use of stop-and-search, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\" title=\"\">Windrush scandal</a>, the disproportionate exclusion of black boys from schools and the failure to act on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/08/the-guardian-view-on-race-and-criminal-justice-inequality-is-unfair-to-all\" title=\"\">Lammy report</a>, which highlighted glaring disparities in the criminal justice system. But they have also raised the impact of austerity, the Grenfell fire and the fact that BAME people are so much more likely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\" title=\"\">to die of Covid-19</a>. Racism is structural, and state neglect can be as deadly as state abuse. It does not always take a knee on the neck to kill someone. Poverty, overcrowding, and unequal access to healthcare can be fatal.</p> <p>It is the increased threat from coronavirus which has driven many to the streets. Though protesters have largely been assiduous in their use of face masks and hand gel, there is a real danger that these gatherings will spread infection. Subsequent self-isolation by participants would help to reduce the risks. But when Dominic Cummings got a free pass for his drive to Durham, the leader of the house has forced MPs to return to a crowded chamber, and the government is ignoring warnings that lockdown is being relaxed too quickly, they must not be scapegoated for any rise in infections. Already, black people in London are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/03/met-police-twice-as-likely-to-fine-black-people-over-lockdown-breaches-research\" title=\"\">twice as likely to be fined</a> for breaching coronavirus regulations as white people.</p> <p>To say that black lives matter is not only to demand that they are not stolen, but to insist that they are truly valued. No one expects this to be realised overnight; but nor are they willing to wait. The breadth of the protests is testament to what has gone wrong, but also a promise that change is possible. The protests are black-led but multiracial, showing the growing breadth of support. As in the US, white people are seeking to be allies. Other people of colour are identifying with black experience, while recognising that they too may benefit from racial hierarchies, and may themselves discriminate. Mistakes will be made. But progress can and must be made, too.</p>",
  "<p>The failure to consider air pollution as a factor in the higher rates of coronavirus deaths among minority ethnic groups is \u201castonishing\u201d and \u201cwholly irresponsible\u201d, according to critics of a Public Health England review.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/calls-mount-for-public-inquiry-into-uk-bame-covid-19-death-rate\">PHE report</a> released on Tuesday confirmed the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on people from ethnic minorities but did not mention air pollution.

The review therefore wrongly projects the idea that [minority ethnic] communities may be more susceptible to coronavirus, when it should instead say they are put into harm\u2019s way by living in more polluted areas and by being overrepresented amongst frontline workers.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Jonathan Grigg, of Queen Mary University of London, a member of the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants, which advises the government, said: \u201cAir pollution absolutely should be part of the consideration. It\u2019s entirely plausible [and] we should at least ask the question.</p> <p>\u201cYou might get a double hit\u201d from long- and short-term exposure to dirty air,\u201d he said. \u201c[Exposed groups] will have a vulnerability due to air pollution coming into Covid, so it will contribute to some extent, but it is difficult to say to what extent.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Francesca Dominici, of Harvard University in the US, also said pollution was an important factor. \u201cWe have a large body of evidence that health risks associated with air pollution exposure are higher among ethnic minorities.\u201d Her research has shown that even a small increase in previous pollution exposure is <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054502v2\">linked to an 8% rise in Covid-19 deaths</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>The PHE report was heavily criticised for a lack of recommendations on how to reduce the disproportionate impact among people from ethnic minorities and for removing a section detailing responses from third parties, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/03/censorship-row-over-report-on-uk-bame-covid-19-deaths\">many of whom highlighted structural racism</a>. On Thursday the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52913539\">rejected claims that \u201csystemic injustice\u201d</a> was the reason for the disparities. Scientists say it is unlikely that any genetic factors play a major role.</p> <p>Badenoch said it was clear \u201cthat much more needs to be done to understand the key drivers of the disparities\u201d, and said PHE did not make recommendations because the data needed was not available. On Friday the Equality and Human Rights Commission said it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/uk-equality-watchdog-to-launch-inquiry-into-entrenched-racism\">carry out an in-depth analysis</a> and develop urgent recommendations to address the loss of lives of people from ethnic minorities.</p> <p>A PHE spokeswoman said: \u201cThe review looked at factors including age, sex, geography, ethnicity, occupation and deprivation.

The data shows the affected groups transcend the classical definitions of both race and ethnicity. That is not to say when we examine all the data in the future we will not find a very tiny sub-population with a mutation which makes them more susceptible. But many find it easier to use race rather than racism as an explanation, partly because you can link it to something inherent in the victims.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/genetics-bame-people-die-coronavirus-structural-racism\">Genetics is not why more BAME people die of coronavirus: structural racism is | Winston Morgan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dominici said: \u201cI really doubt that genetic factors play a bigger role than environmental and societal factors and racism.\u201d</p> <p>Issy Bray, a health statistics expert at the University of the West of England, said: \u201cWe cannot rule it out, as other diseases do affect certain ethnic groups for genetic reasons, eg sickle cell anaemia. However, it is already clear that the relationship between ethnicity and risk of coronavirus is at least partially explained by a range of societal factors, and it is these inequalities that we should be tackling.\u201d</p> <p>The scientists said the influence of air pollution could be singled out if carefully analysed alongside other important factors such as population density, deprivation, occupation and obesity, ideally using data on individuals. Bray said smartphone apps that monitor symptoms could be useful by providing large amounts of personal and location data.</p>",

  "<p>In the middle of a pandemic that is killing inordinate numbers of black people, many have been grieving the lives of George Floyd, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/david-mcatee-louisville-protests-family\">David McAtee</a> and many others, while living with the realities of Covid-19. That George Floyd lived through coronavirus to then be killed by police who cut off his oxygen is a cruel irony. Yet his death makes it clear that we cannot separate the pandemic from police violence because they are both driven by the same thing \u2013 white supremacy.</p> <p>Since the long hot summer of 1967, when more than 150 rebellions ripped across the country, there have been various calls for reform, changes that were supposed to make the lives of black people better. In each instance, those lives have not been improved by these processes and often undelivered promises.&nbsp;</p> <p>Body cameras, non-lethal weapons, increasing the diversity of police forces and the like were all heralded as changing the face of policing. But they all only changed the <em>techniques</em>. Instead of making officers act more responsibly, we know that body cameras can be turned on and off and cops continue to brutalise the public they purportedly serve.</p> <p>Therefore, reforming a clearly broken system will not do much to keep black people from dying in the streets. In the last week or so, people have continued to be brutalised and killed by police while protesting against that very thing \u2013 police violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>This pain people are witnessing now occurs in so many facets of black lives, but we don\u2019t see black stories as part of the collective narrative of the US. While the racism that black bodies are made to endure might seem localised, the marginalisation, expulsion and exclusion black people experience have consequences for other communities.&nbsp;</p> <p>The \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, launched under Richard Nixon, was escalated in the mid-1980s to address the so-called crack epidemic. In very short order, crack cocaine became linked to \u201curban\u201d crime. The racialisation of the drug made black people the face of addiction and led to calls for more severe punishment for possession of crack. As a result of moral panics over \u201ccrack babies\u201d and other such nonsense, we saw harsher punishment for crack versus powder cocaine possession and calls for mandatory minimum sentences that increased incarceration rates for black people.</p> <p>It was not until the opioid epidemic hit rural and suburban white America that cries to see drug addiction as an \u201cillness\u201d were heeded. Some who saw the ravages of opioid addiction were calling for drug treatment, rather than the prison cell they advocated for others. In short, the drugs that had claimed so many black lives came for white people \u2013 with different responses.&nbsp;</p> <p>And yet here we are again. Right now in the US, Senator Rand Paul is obstructing the passage of a bill that would make lynching a federal crime after more than a century of advocacy. The journalist and activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/27/ida-b-wells-civil-rights-movement-reporter\">Ida B Wells-Barnett</a> described lynching in 1909 as a \u201ccolour line-murder\u201d and, most importantly, \u201ca national crime and requires a national remedy\u201d. She said what too few in Congress appreciate today \u2013 the death of black people by legal and extra-legal means is \u201ca blight upon our nation\u201d.</p> <p>More than a century later, black people still cannot get the US government to recognise our pains. The reason George Floyd and so many others are dead is because they are black. And being black in my country is treated, by some police officers and vigilantes alike, as probable cause to harass, detain and kill.</p> <p>Consider black people as canaries in the coal mine. What happens to them in this country matters for everyone. Those who would seek to raise the canard of black on black crime as a riposte to the charges of systemic racism in this country have not been paying attention. And focusing on the deaths of those harmed at the hands of the police ignores the many violences black people experience on a daily basis in the US. Forget the term \u201cmicro-aggressions\u201d \u2013 let\u2019s call them \u201cmacroaggressive\u201d. It\u2019s probably not going to be the Knight Rider at your door, but maybe the other \u201cgood\u201d white people who come armed with guns demanding to search your home.</p> <p>Yet black people are made to feel ashamed for saying they have been victims. To be a victim simply means that you have been harmed by the actions of another. Yet black people have been told over and over again that the mere mention of racism is unfair. They\u2019re playing the \u201crace card\u201d or adopting a loser\u2019s mentality.</p> <p>That\u2019s a myth we tell so that black people don\u2019t dwell on the many ways they have been damaged. This is not unique to the US. But acknowledging black pain, our pain, is seen as some sort of weakness or loss of control rather than one of the things we must confront if we are to imagine ways to repair these harms.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want black people to simply survive this moment - I want them to thrive. So far, we have been surviving and it\u2019s not served black people well and it\u2019s certainly not served my country well.&nbsp;</p> <p>The US needs robust, systemic change and we will not get there by pretending we have not been building up to this moment as long as we have been a country.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is a nation founded on theft and it\u2019s payback time. It is always the right time to do the right thing.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Niambi Michele Carter is the author of American While Black and is associate professor of political science at Howard University</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The reaction of many of those in leadership positions in the Church of England to the killing of George Floyd has been to ask BAME people about their experience, not only in the United States but also in Britain.</p> <p>Social media posts with the hashtag #blacklivesmatter have been copious, as have been the searches for people \u201cwho can speak about race and the UK church\u201d with sensitive rejoinders about \u201cwhite people putting pressure on black people to tell us how to solve racism for us\u201d.</p> <p>All of this comes as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/02/john-sentamu-i-would-join-george-floyd-protests\">Dr John Sentamu</a> prepares to step down from his post as archbishop of York.

When diocesan bishops next meet and discuss their response to the events in America, the disproportionate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/calls-mount-for-public-inquiry-into-uk-bame-covid-19-death-rate\">impact of Covid-19</a> on BAME communities and on poor people in urban communities, there will be no one of colour with an equal voice among them.&nbsp;</p> <p>The questions about race and racism in the church extend far beyond its leadership. Yet when the Conservative party, hitherto unknown for racially progressive leadership, appoints a BAME man and a BAME woman to two of the four highest offices of state and appoints others to the cabinet, the one-colour nature of the senior leadership of the Church of England begins to look perilously archaic.</p> <p>A glance at the most senior level of leadership in the Church of England reveals an alarmingly retrograde trend. Michael Nazir-Ali, who served as the bishop of Rochester, was the church\u2019s first BAME diocesan bishop when he was appointed in 1994. Following Sentamu\u2019s appointment as bishop of Birmingham in 2002, the church enjoyed the zenith of its ethnic diversity in leadership with two senior bishops until Nazir-Ali\u2019s retirement in 2009. For the last decade, Sentamu has alone represented that diversity.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/beaten-in-uganda-abused-in-the-uk-john-sentamus-long-struggle-against-injustice\">Beaten in Uganda, abused in the UK: John Sentamu\u2019s long struggle against injustice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But leadership in the church is about more than bishops. Leadership comes in many forms \u2013 lay and ordained, in <a href=\"https://www.onlinechristiancolleges.com/faq/what-is-parachurch/\">parachurch organisations</a>, mission agencies, theological colleges and diocesan administrators, to name but a few.&nbsp;</p> <p>These groups present an equally monochrome image of leadership.

There are no BAME members of HTB\u2019s senior clergy or senior leadership team. None of their churches across London and the UK is led by BAME clergy. According to New Wine\u2019s website, there are no BAME clergy or lay leaders in its 30-strong team of national directors, regional directors and heads of ministry.</p> <p>But this failure is not confined to the church\u2019s evangelical wing. In leading Catholic organisations the picture is the same. The newest organisation, <a href=\"http://46.32.240.47/sodalityofmary.co.uk/about-us/\">the Sodality of Mary Mother of Priests</a>, promotes itself on social media with a picture of a group with an image of 25 priests gathered around an altar \u2013 all of whom are white. More established national Catholic networks paint a similar picture. The leadership of the <a href=\"https://www.sswsh.com/\">Society of Saint Wilfrid and Hilda</a> is exclusively white, as is the leadership of Forward in Faith in its executive committee. If the old dictum that \u201cyou need to see it to be it\u201d is applied to the church\u2019s leadership, that offers little hope to young BAME church members for their inclusion or participation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The one-colour nature of the senior leadership of the Church of England begins to look perilously archaic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Try looking for BAME appointments in other senior roles within the church. Diocesan secretaries? None. Chairs of diocesan boards of finance? None. Principals of theological colleges? None.&nbsp;</p> <p>Last week, Robin Ward, the principal of one of the church\u2019s training institutions, <a href=\"https://premierchristian.news/en/news/article/archbishop-of-york-in-twitter-spat-over-social-distancing-at-black-lives-matter-protests\">took to Twitter</a> to call out the archbishop of York for supporting the Black Lives Matter rally in Hyde Park. Pitching his desire to see churches open their doors again against the tragedy of the death of George Floyd highlighted the lack of understanding or empathy at work in parts of the higher echelons of the church.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the picture is not entirely bleak. In recent years, there has been much rejoicing at the appointment of women and men as assistant or suffragan bishops in the Church of England. <a href=\"https://canterburydiocese.org/our-life/news-events/news/rose-hudson-wilkin-named-bishop-of-dover.php\">Rose Hudson-Wilkin as bishop of Dover</a>, <a href=\"https://www.chelmsford.anglican.org/area/bradwell\">John Perumbalath as the bishop of Bradwell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2017/14-july/news/uk/refugee-from-iran-to-be-first-bishop-of-loughborough\">Guli Francis-Dehqani</a> as bishop of Loughborough and <a href=\"https://staugustinescollege.ac.uk/staff/karowei-dorgu/\">Karowei Dorgu</a> as bishop of Woolwich joined bishop <a href=\"https://www.anglicancommunion.org/structures/member-churches/member-church/diocese/position.aspx?church=england&amp;dio=diocese-in-europe&amp;pos=suffragan-bishop-of-the-diocese-in-europe&amp;posID=4286\">David Hamid</a> from the diocese of Europe.</p> <p>Yet if we were add up all of the Church of England\u2019s serving BAME bishops, out of more than 100 we would still be counting on one hand.&nbsp;</p> <p>For some, the appointment of Sentamu as archbishop of York was going to mean that the issue of race and racism in the Church of England could now be dismissed. That kind of aspiration is simplistic. After all, after eight years of the Obama presidency in the United States, when one hoped that historical progress was being made, we are confronted with the opposite.</p> <p>In a church that rightly proclaims that the gifts of the holy spirit are for all people, from every race and nation, why does the Church of England present such a contradictory picture?</p> <p>\u2022 Arun Arora is vicar of St Nics Durham</p> <p>\u2022 This article was co-written by Eileen Harrop, Remi Ole and Shemil Matthew</p>",

Activists who have long fought to cut law enforcement budgets say they are seeing an unprecedented wave of support for their ideas, with some elected officials for the first time proposing budget reductions and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/minneapolis-public-school-end-police-contract\">divestments from police</a>. Here\u2019s what we know about the movement, and how cities and states are responding. </p> \n  <h2><strong>What does it mean to </strong><strong>\u2018defund the police\u2019</strong><strong>? </strong></h2> \n  <p>For years, community groups have advocated for defunding law enforcement \u2013 taking money away from police and prisons \u2013 and reinvesting those funds in services. The basic principle is that government budgets and \u201cpublic safety\u201d spending should prioritize housing, employment, community health, education and other vital programs, instead of police officers. Advocates argue that defunding is the best way forward since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">attempts to reform police practices</a> over the last five years have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/us-police-officers-fired-rehired-why\">failed</a>, as evidenced by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">brutal killing of George Floyd</a>. Groups have a range of demands, with some seeking modest reductions and others viewing full defunding as a step toward abolishing contemporary police services. </p> \n  <h2><strong>How much does America currently spend on police? </strong></h2> \n  <p>In the past four decades, the cost of policing in the US has tripled and is now $115bn, according to a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-04/america-s-policing-budget-has-nearly-tripled-to-115-billion\">recent analysis</a>. That steady increase comes as crime has been consistently declining. In most cities, spending on police is <a href=\"https://populardemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Freedom%20To%20Thrive%2C%20Higher%20Res%20Version.pdf\">significantly greater</a> than spending on services and other departments ($1.8bn on police in Los Angeles, for example, which is <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-04/lapd-budget-cuts-garcetti-protests-explainer\">more than half</a> the city\u2019s general fund). The Covid-19 economic crisis has led cities and states to make drastic budget <a href=\"https://www.changethenypd.org/nycbudgetjustice\">cuts</a> to education, youth programs, arts and culture, parks, libraries, housing services and more.

It has never been. We can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black communities. We did this back in 2017, and regretfully I brought it back with my comments this week. We must stop talking about the flag and shift our attention to the real issues of systemic racial injustice, economic oppression, police brutality, and judicial &amp; prison reform. We are at a critical juncture in our nation\u2019s history! If not now, then when? We as a white community need to listen and learn from the pain and suffering of our black communities. We must acknowledge the problems, identify the solutions, and then put this into action. The black community cannot do it alone. This will require all of us.</a></p> \n     <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drewbrees/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Drew Brees</a> (@drewbrees) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-06-06T02:10:07+00:00\">Jun 5, 2020 at 7:10pm PDT</time></p>\n    </div>\n   </blockquote> \n   <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> \n  </figure> \n  <p>\u201cTo @realdonaldtrump.

The league\u2019s commissioner, Roger Goodell, put out a statement admitting <strong>the league had been wrong not to listen to its players\u2019 opposition to racism</strong> (although, significantly, Goodell did not mention Kaepernick, who has been effectively exiled from the league). </p> \n  <p>Melissa Jacobs has written on the significance of Goodell\u2019s statement:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Goodell hardly deserves a parade for his change of tone. After all, his NFL is the one that tossed aside its moral compass and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/03/nfl-statement-george-floyd-death\">turned its back on Kaepernick</a> four years ago and every day since. Goodell\u2019s statement would have been far more powerful had he mentioned Kaepernick by name. Either way, the NFL\u2019s banishment of Kaepernick is a permanent stain on the NFL. Nothing can change that now.</p> \n   <p>Goodell\u2019s statement was not proactive but reactive to a litany of players who drew a line in the sand. But it was quick and decisive and achieved the unthinkable: The NFL gave Donald Trump the middle finger. It finally detached itself from Trump and his crazy, dangerous strategy of exploiting the flag and national anthem to suppress and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/what-is-antifa-trump-terrorist-designation\">demonize peaceful protest</a>.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>You can read the full article below:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/06/nfl-statement-wrong-players-racism-protests-roger-goodell-donald-trump-football\">The NFL did the unthinkable: it gave Donald Trump the middle finger</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-06T14:09:52.262Z\">at 3.09pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edb9db18f0883ec2fc1be2d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-06T13:56:31.851Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh has filed a grievance after the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette <strong>pulled an African American reporter from its coverage</strong> of this week\u2019s protests <strong>because they believed she lacked objectivity</strong>.</p> \n  <p>In a tweet that went viral, Alexis Johnson compared the looting that has taken place at some protests over the police killing of George Floyd to the damage caused by fans at a concert by country singer Kenny Chesney. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/alexisjreports/status/1267081467731103749\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Horrifying scenes and aftermath from selfish LOOTERS who don\u2019t care about this city!!!!!<br><br>.... oh wait sorry.

  "<p>The shadow minister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney has urged Mathias Cormann to listen to the pain of First Nations people after the finance minister condemned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/06/australian-black-lives-matter-protests-tens-of-thousands-demand-end-to-indigenous-deaths-in-custody\">Saturday\u2019s mass protests</a> to demand an end to Indigenous deaths in custody as reckless, selfish and self-indulgent.</p> <p>Cormann used an interview on Sky News on Sunday to launch a full-throated attack on participants of Saturday\u2019s events in several cities because the protests proceeded in contradiction of current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-mass-events-and-foreign-travel-should-be-cancelled-says-australian-government\">health advice to avoid mass gatherings</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite irresponsible what we\u2019ve seen there,\u201d Cormann said. \u201cAs I think about the heartbreak of families who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/28/funerals-coronavirus-relatives-coffins-families\">haven\u2019t been able to attend funerals</a> for their loved ones because they were doing the right thing by taking the health advice, my heart just goes out to them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/06/australian-black-lives-matter-protests-tens-of-thousands-demand-end-to-indigenous-deaths-in-custody\">Australian Black Lives Matter protests: tens of thousands demand end to Indigenous deaths in custody</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI mean, as they see people going recklessly to these sorts of demonstrations, that must be just awful for them to watch. I think it is incredibly selfish. It\u2019s incredibly self-indulgent. And yes, it does impose unnecessary and unacceptable risk on to the community.\u201d</p> <p>Burney later told reporters she did not want to get into an argument with Cormann, but she said it was the responsibility of elected leaders and people with a voice in the community to \u201clisten to the cries\u201d of people protesting against institutional racism, and deaths in custody.</p> <p>\u201cI am not going to get into a two and fro between myself and Mathias Cormann, except to say that it would be helpful, I think, for him to look at the record and look at what the reality is in the state that he represents,\u201d Burney said.</p> <p>Sunday\u2019s conflict came as Australia\u2019s deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly warned it was possible the protests would generate a new cluster of Covid-19 infections. He said the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee would discuss on Monday whether the risks created by the mass gatherings would have any impact on the speed at which the economy reopened.</p> <p>Kelly urged participants in the rallies to get tested if they developed any symptoms, and he said public health advisors \u201cwill be on alert\u201d. He said if a cluster of infections developed, and if there were \u201ccommunity-acquired cases&nbsp;not otherwise linked to known&nbsp;clusters occurring in the next week or two, and then as we investigate&nbsp;those cases, we find they were at&nbsp;the protest, that would be a game-changer\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBut at the moment, all we&nbsp;have his mass gatherings, we don\u2019t&nbsp;know if anyone in those mass gatherings were infected or&nbsp;infectious, and so it is a&nbsp;wait-and-see approach,\u201d Kelly said.</p> <p>The deputy chief medical officer said his own view was \u201cblack lives do matter, all lives matter. I absolutely understand the depth of feeling\u201d. While he said the protests were not cautious, and could spark new infections: \u201cThis is not a blame game at all\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t roll back time. It happened, now we have to wait and watch.\u201d</p> <p>The deputy leader of the opposition, Richard Marles, acknowledged that protests in the middle of a pandemic were a \u201cvexed issue\u201d but he said Cormann\u2019s rebuke on Sunday was \u201ctone deaf\u201d. Marles said if people were born Indigenous in Australia, life outcomes in education, employment, mortality and incarceration were materially worse than non-Indigenous Australians.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel&nbsp;like I\u2019m in a position to say to&nbsp;Indigenous Australians who are&nbsp;protesting against that, that this&nbsp;is a selfish and indulgent act,\u201d the deputy Labor leader told the ABC. \u201cI&nbsp;felt uncomfortable about the mass&nbsp;gathering, but I\u2019m not about to&nbsp;engage in that kind of judgment of&nbsp;those who did it.\u201d</p> <p>Ahead of the protests, the prime minister validated the cause as important, but his strong advice, and the advice of the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, was that people not attend the mass gatherings.</p> <p>While acknowledging wrongs were done in this country, Morrison also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/04/morrison-says-australia-should-not-import-black-lives-matter-protests-after-deaths-in-custody-rally\">questioned those drawing comparisons</a> between Australia and the situation in the United States, where protesters have rallied for several days following George Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of police in Minneapolis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/28/deaths-inside-indigenous-australian-deaths-in-custody\">Deaths inside: every Indigenous death in custody since 2008 tracked \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to import things happening in other countries here to Australia,\u201d Morrison said last week.

In Melbourne, where the crowd stretched across many blocks, some also began to dance when the African Australian musician Sampa the Great took to the stage to perform two songs.</p> \n<p>Black lives matter, she said, \u201cbecause I woke up black today, and I\u2019m going to wake up black tomorrow\u201d.</p> \n<p>Crowds also gathered in Adelaide, where police granted protesters an exemption to allow them to hold a rally, as well as smaller cities such as Hobart, Wagga Wagga, Townsville, Byron Bay.</p> \n<p>In Sydney the end of the march for most was marked peacefully, although some protestors were caught in frightening scenes at Central Station.</p> \n<p>A crowd appeared to be pressed together in the underground concourse at the station and police used pepper spray on some.</p> \n<p>One protester who was inside Central station at the time of the clash told the Guardian it was unclear why police made the decision to use the spray.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He said police had been ushering protesters in the vicinity of Belmore Park \u2013 where the march ended \u2013 into Central station, when the incident occurred shortly after 6pm.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/_rockrit/status/1269190099905859585\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">it appears NSW police kettled straggling protestors at Central Station<a href=\"https://t.co/AJD5ll5AvI\">pic.twitter.com/AJD5ll5AvI</a></p>\u2014 andrew rickert (@_rockrit) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_rockrit/status/1269190099905859585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 6, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI was walking through [the station entrance] and there was some commotion behind me where police had formed a line.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cOut of nowhere they just started macing people, it didn\u2019t look like&nbsp;there was any type of reason to do it,\u201d the protester, who did not wish to be identified, said.&nbsp;</p>"
