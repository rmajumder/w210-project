  "<p>Joe Biden has apologised for saying that if African Americans \u201chave a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black\u201d, a remark which prompted a storm of controversy and fierce attacks from supporters of the president.</p> <p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been such a wise guy,\u201d Biden said on a call with the US Black Chambers, an African-American business group, which was added to his public schedule. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been so cavalier.\u201d</p> <p>Biden also said he would never \u201ctake the African American community for granted\u201d.</p> <p>The former vice-president made the offending remark in an interview with Charlamagne tha God, a co-host of the radio show The Breakfast Club.</p> <p>After Biden had been pressed on issues including the legalization of marijuana and his choice of running mate, a campaign aide interjected to say he had to wrap it up, prompting the host to say: \u201cYou can\u2019t do that to black media.\u201d</p> <p>Saying \u201cI do that to black media and white media\u201d, Biden said his wife needed to use his studio.</p> <p>Charlamagne said: \u201cListen, you\u2019ve got to come see us when you come to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\">New York</a>, VP Biden. It\u2019s a long way until November. We\u2019ve got more questions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got more questions?\u201d Biden said. \u201cWell I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt don\u2019t have nothing to do with Trump,\u201d the host said. \u201cIt has to do with the fact [that] I want something for my community.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTake a look at my record, man!\u201d Biden said, before claiming his record as a senator and vice-president was \u201csecond to none\u201d.</p> <p>Biden has been criticized and attacked for previous positions and comments on race, such as when he reminisced about past \u201ccivility\u201d in the Senate by recalling his work with two senators who opposed racial integration.</p> <p>His comment about black voters and Trump prompted fierce and instant backlash.</p> <p>The South Carolina senator Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the upper chamber, tweeted: \u201c1.3 million black Americans already voted for Trump in 2016. This morning, Joe Biden told every single one of us we \u2018ain\u2019t black\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Katrina Pierson, who leads the Black Voices for Trump advisory board, said: \u201cToday he once again proved what a growing number of black Americans and I have always known: Joe Biden does not deserve our votes.\u201d</p> <p>Scott and Pierson featured on a press call quickly convened by the Trump campaign, in which Pierson reportedly grew defensive when pressed on Trump\u2019s own lengthy history of racially insensitive comments.</p> <p>Trump himself retweeted Scott\u2019s view that Biden\u2019s comments \u201care the most arrogant and condescending thing I\u2019ve heard in a very long time\u201d and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1263928148283887616\">commended</a> an African American Fox News host, Harris Faulkner, as \u201cA GREAT AMERICAN\u201d.</p> <p>Faulkner said Biden\u2019s comment was \u201cmore than just a little offensive, it is short-sighted, it is a blind spot for this former vice-president\u201d.</p> <p>Before Biden\u2019s apology, Symone Sanders, a senior adviser who is African American, said the comment was \u201cmade in jest\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s be clear about what the VP was saying,\u201d Sanders tweeted. \u201cHe was making the distinction that he would put his record with the African American community up against Trump\u2019s any day. Period.\u201d\ufeff\ufeff</p> <p>Biden has committed to picking a woman as his running mate and two leading contenders, Kamala Harris and Stacey Abrams, are black. Near the end of his interview on Friday, however, he was pressed on reports that he is considering Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, who is white.</p> <p>Black voters \u201csaved your political life in the primaries\u201d, Charlamagne said, referring to Biden\u2019s comeback from early defeats with a big win in South Carolina, and adding that such voters \u201chave things they want from you\u201d.</p> <p>Biden said: \u201cI guarantee you there are multiple black women being considered. Multiple.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I am very tired of Joe Biden. My vote for him was already hanging by a thread before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/joe-biden-draws-criticism-americans-who-back-trump-aint-black\">his disastrous interview with Charlamagne tha God</a> on Friday. Interrupting the Breakfast Club host\u2019s explanation that black people needed assurances that our communities will benefit from his presidency, Biden asserted: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or for Trump, then you ain\u2019t black.\u201d</p> \n<p>Again, I am very tired of Joe Biden. Not because I am a purist, or have inflexible ideological commitments of what it will take to remove Donald Trump from office. But rather because Biden\u2019s condescension towards black communities is intolerable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/15/biden-progressives-push-left\">The fight is on for progressives to push Biden to the left.

But his mistreatment of black people, verbally and politically, is decades old, and is a reflection of the Democratic party in general.</p> \n<p>Throughout Biden\u2019s career, he has boasted about his ability to bridge partisan divides by sacrificing the needs of black people and poor people in the name of \u201ccompromise\u201d. For the last 30 years, Biden has repeatedly talked about freezing, cutting, or raising the age for social security and other benefits \u2013 as much as $2tn one time. <a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/article/21856/joe-biden-cut-medicare-social-security-retirement-age\">His response</a> to concerns that these cuts would hurt the poor? \u201cWe\u2019re going to do lots of hard things \u2026 we might as well do this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Social security is an important program for black people, especially as we age. Among <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/africanamer-alt.pdf\">African Americans receiving </a><a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/africanamer-alt.pdf\">social </a><a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/africanamer-alt.pdf\">security</a>, 35% of elderly married couples and 58% of unmarried elderly persons relied on it for 90% or more of their income. The reliance is not due to laziness or spending habits \u2013 people of color and white people make <a href=\"https://crr.bc.edu/briefs/401k-plans-and-race/\">similar choices and contributions to retirement</a> \u2013 but due to racism, lack of workplace retirement plans and barriers to accessing high-paying jobs.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey know where my heart is,\u201d Biden <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/us/politics/joe-biden-iowa-black-voters.html\">has said</a>, of black voters.</p> \n<p>But do we?</p> \n<p>Senator Kamala Harris was <a href=\"https://amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/03/black-woman-president-kamala-harris\">severely scrutinized</a> for her treatment of poor black women as a prosecutor \u2013 yet Biden\u2019s criminal justice record makes Harris look like Thurgood Marshall. Biden authored and successfully passed the $30bn 1994 <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/20/18677998/joe-biden-1994-crime-bill-law-mass-incarceration\">Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act</a>. Besides putting 100,000 additional police officers in the streets, the crime bill distributed funding for new prison construction, encouraged prosecutors to charge children as adults, and even added the death penalty for 28 new areas, including <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-69-federal-death-penalty-act-1994\">drug-related offenses</a>. Pushing for further criminalization, then senator Biden argued that George HW Bush\u2019s crime plan <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?8997-1/democratic-response-drug-policy-address\">did not go far enough</a> because it did not \u201cinclude enough police officers to catch the violent thugs, not enough prosecutors to convict them, not enough judges to sentence them, and not enough prison cells to put them away for a long time\u201d. An older black generation fought through Jim Crow only for Biden to help make sure that their children and grandchildren lived through a new Jim Crow.</p> \n<p>On the House floor, Biden compared his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/joe-biden-crime-laws.html\">criminal justice approach</a> to Richard Nixon\u2019s law and order stance: \u201cI would say, \u2018Lock the SOBs up.\u2019\u201d Black people were arrested in droves following this bill, despite comparable drug use rates to white people; many are still sitting in prison today. Biden has since acknowledged flaws in the bill, but last summer he reiterated his support for the bill. The law spent $30bn but contributed to only <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/opinion/the-police-cant-solve-the-problem-they-are-the-problem.html\">a 1.3% decline in violent crime</a>. He has yet to call for it to be repealed.</p> \n<p>Today, some cities plan to expunge marijuana records and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/12/02/evanston-illinois-reparations-plan-african-americans-is-marijuana-tax/\">hope to pay reparations</a> to black people formerly incarcerated for marijuana offenses. But Biden can\u2019t seem to let go; <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/06/joe-biden-legalize-marijuana-111642\">he is inconsistent and ambivalent about marijuana legalization</a>. He has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/politics/joe-biden-marijuana-gateway-drug/index.html\">argued</a> it may be a gateway drug, a statement he has since <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2020/03/06/joe-biden-is-frustrated-people-think-he-still-believes-marijuana-is-a-gateway-drug/#5a5184749aa2\">dialed back</a>.<strong> </strong>Of course, keeping marijuana illegal at the federal level does not mean that people will not use it, but rather that the extra police that he put on the street will send people of color to jail for using it. Ironically, the police were probably nowhere to be found when Biden\u2019s friends <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/politics/in-secretly-taped-conversations-glimpses-of-the-future-president.html\">George W Bush</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/\">Barack Obama</a> used marijuana. If anything, the drug seems to be a gateway to the White House.</p> \n<p>Despite attempting to cut social programs and increasing mass incarceration, Biden claims to care about black families. But he doesn\u2019t seem to know many. During the September 2019 Democratic debate he claimed that poor families should put on a <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/sports/joe-biden-parents-should-make-sure-you-have-the-record-player-on-at-night-to-expand-childrens-vocabulary/vi-AAHfDMH\">record player</a> so their children will know more words. Recently, during an interview with the New York Times editorial board, he argued that poor black parents feel ashamed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/17/opinion/joe-biden-nytimes-interview.html\">because they cannot read and skip parent-teacher conferences</a>. He was hoping to encourage them to be better parents. But his assertion is incorrect. Black and white parents have comparable participation rates overall and attend parent-teacher conferences at the <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2017/2017102.pdf\">exact same rates</a>. In fact, black parents and poor parents are the most likely to check their children\u2019s homework and <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2017/2017102.pdf\">meet with</a> guidance counselors. Biden instead relied on stereotypes that black people are not involved in their children\u2019s lives.</p> \n<p>Harris forced Biden to confront his work with racist elected officials to stop integration efforts using school busing. That was not his only education mistake. Biden played a significant role in creating the student debt crisis, including making student loan discharge \u201c<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/01/07/joe-biden-student-loans/\">nearly impossible</a>\u201d. This is devastating to black people, who disproportionately carry school debt. While the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/06/why-women-hold-the-majority-of-student-loans.html\">average school debt</a> for black women with a bachelor\u2019s degree is about $25,000, that level of education does not provide the same level of financial security for black women as it does other groups, including white people with less education (primarily because of sexism and racism).</p> \n<p>Again and again, Biden\u2019s relationship with black Americans, like the Democratic National Committee\u2019s relationship, has been patronizing at best and actively harmful at worst.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Biden\u2019s friendship with one black person does not mean that he\u2019s a friend to black people</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Some black people will support Biden because of his association with Barack Obama \u2013 even though <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/obama-to-biden-dont-run\">Obama himself doesn\u2019t seem especially excited about Biden</a> becoming president. The Obama days feel distant yet warm compared to Donald Trump\u2019s current presidency. But remember: Biden cycled millions of black people in and out of jail, voted for massive numbers of poor people to go to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/12/us/politics/joe-biden-iraq-war.html\">war in Iraq</a>, threw Anita Hill under the bus <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/politics/joe-biden-anita-hill.html\">to confirm a conservative justice</a> to the US supreme court, and, under Obama\u2019s administration, helped to deport <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/11/joe-biden-deportations-immigration-barack-obama\">millions of immigrants</a> and <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2018/08/joe-biden-democratic-party-military-hawk\">bombed brown countries</a>. When Biden was vice-president, black <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2017/12/obama-foreclosure-crisis-wealth-inequality\">home ownership and wealth</a> declined significantly, even as it <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2019/02/28/feature/the-heartbreaking-decrease-in-black-homeownership/\">rose</a> for other races. Biden\u2019s friendship with one black person does not mean that he\u2019s a friend to black people.</p> \n<p>The Democratic party holds black people in an abusive relationship but says you cannot leave because the other option is more abusive. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t believe that a vote against Biden solely means a vote for Trump. Perhaps it is a vote against being captured by the party that makes empty promises every four years when it is election time, and delivers nothing. Perhaps it is a vote against the crime bill, drones and deportations. Perhaps it is a vote against covert and overt racism.</p> \n<p>Biden and others will rightfully argue that Trump is worse, and I agree. But what can Biden actually deliver? Will there be fewer drones if he\u2019s president? Maybe not. Fewer deportations? Maybe not. Less money to police departments? No. Will fewer black people die from police? Unlikely. Will black people have healthcare? Unlikely. Will black wealth increase? Unlikely. Will Palestinian lives be safer? Unlikely. Commitments to preserving our climate? Doubtful. If black people have a hard time figuring out the differences between Trump and Biden, then that is Biden\u2019s problem, not ours.</p> \n<p>Joe Biden refuses to reckon with the harm that he has caused to people all over the world. His best line is that he is better than the other guy, and that is exactly how abusive relationships function. Black people \u2013 all people \u2013 deserve better than Biden and the Democratic party. And yes, we are still black.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Derecka Purnell is a social movement lawyer and writer based in Washington, DC.

This is a sonic commentary on police brutality, black children that are being murdered and hate crimes in general. The alliteration alone, to describe human life in that way, I thought was incredibly poignant. It\u2019s 13 minutes of pain and beauty and sorrow, but also hope.

I feel like only certain black artists are given that, and they have to play jazz, instrumental or electronic music. We associate folks like Brandy [and her producers] Timbaland and Darkchild in black American hip-hop culture, but don\u2019t necessarily always associate that culture with the intellectual. I think we\u2019re seeing more women getting that, but there\u2019s still proximity to whiteness and white maleness and desirability that\u2019s involved too.

I think it stems probably from experiences when I was a child. I started understanding what it meant to be poor, and that there was a social hierarchy, when I started doing after-school music programmes and was confronted with kids of different classes and races \u2013 and that was when I started to understand loneliness.

He is also a LGBTQ activist, committed to putting queer identities back into these narratives (his band is also comprised of mostly queer musicians). Spider Tales\u2019 title refers to a west African folkloric figure, Anansi, a rebellious spirit that has persisted in its people, despite its oppressors\u2019 attempts to smother it.</p> <p>With this in mind, Blount\u2019s delivery sounds fittingly glorious, celebratory and contemporary.

On the gorgeous, little-known The Angels Done Bowed Down, the sight of a hanging Jesus suggests other lynchings. Blount also covers Lead Belly\u2019s Where Did You Sleep Last Night with an arresting new power, twisting the gender of its subject, and making it a song about homelessness. Direct, accessible and thought-provoking throughout, fans of Americana, Gillian Welch, the blues and alternative music will also find inspiration here.

Some states provide funeral homes with set reimbursement amounts to cover funeral and burial costs for families receiving public aid.</p> <p>In Detroit, Monique Marks, president and CEO of Franklin-Wright Settlements, an agency that provides basic services to the city\u2019s neediest, said she has seen \u201can enormous surge\u201d in these aid requests. But with government offices closed, the process of getting that help is cumbersome at best.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the resources are so buried under so many layers that even us professionals have to be trained to know how to navigate [the system],\u201d Marks said. Instead of directing her grieving clients to the state for help, Marks now calls one of a handful of trusted funeral homes and seeks their help directly. Some accept the work, not knowing when \u2013 or if \u2013 they will be paid.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These funeral homes are struggling because a lot of families don\u2019t have insurance</p> <footer> <cite>Hari Close</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In March, the industry\u2019s critical public health function and fragile infrastructure led the National Funeral Directors Association to seek special relief for the \u201cdeathcare profession\u201d and the \u201cpoor, underserved and indigent who cannot afford a funeral\u201d in the stimulus bill. Their request to Congress went unheeded. A recent Covid-19 relief bill, passed by the House of Representatives on 15 May, <a href=\"https://www.nfda.org/news/in-the-news/nfda-news/id/5099/legislative-alert-heroes-act-update\">includes funeral service</a> as essential work. But President Trump <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/trump-says-new-house-coronavirus-relief-package-dead-arrival-n1206466\">declared the bill</a> \u201cdead on arrival\u201d.</p> <p>Under the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s 31 March guidelines for Covid-19 emergency medical care, hospitals will receive reimbursements for certain costs, including temporary expansions to their facilities and their Covid-19 PPE expenses. No similar provision was made or guidelines issued for deathcare workers and funeral homes. Although Fema has offered funeral assistance after other emergencies, such as Hurricane Katrina, the Trump administration has yet to issue formal authorization of funeral reimbursement funds for families under this program.</p> <p>Frustrated with the lack of action, Carol Williams, NFDMA\u2019s executive director, made a desperate appeal to Fema on behalf of her members in April. They were awash in infected corpses, she explained, and needed help finding affordable PPE. She was redirected to Georgia\u2019s emergency management agency, which gave her six phone numbers to try, none of which could help her.</p> <p>While many funeral homes could qualify for small business loans, some owners like Churchman were simply too busy to apply. \u201cIn just the first 10 days of April, we were already at five times the average volume of monthly calls,\u201d Churchman said. Even if she had applied, there\u2019s a good chance she would have been <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90498767/that-was-it-silence-as-bailout-funds-evaporate-minority-owned-businesses-say-theyve-been-shut-out\">shut out</a> of the program.</p> <p>For Williams, the lack of government action is another form of indifference toward African American communities and those who serve them. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many of us are in the planning process,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere is the caring about what happens to our people?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">.</a> </figure>  <p><strong>When Robert Robinson fell ill in March</strong> with a presumed case of Covid-19, paramedics took him to Detroit\u2019s Sinai-Grace \u2013 the hospital that made national headlines in April when pictures of stacked body bags in vacant hospital rooms were leaked to the media. Robert\u2019s wife, Gwyn, was already on a ventilator at Providence hospital in suburban Southfield, Michigan. On 28 March, Robert died. Three days later Gwyn did, too. Their bodies were sent to Stephen Kemp\u2019s funeral home in Southfield. More than two weeks later, their bodies were still in Kemp\u2019s refrigeration unit alongside 47 others. All 49 were African American, all believed to be victims of Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been in a situation like I have been in the last two weeks,\u201d said Kemp, who has been a mortician for 36 years. \u201cThe doctors are so overwhelmed that they don\u2019t have time to put two lines on saying that they\u2019re Covid-19 or whatever the diagnosis and cause and manner of death,\u201d Kemp said, referring to the death certificate funeral home directors need before they can proceed with any burials. Without that verification, bodies stack up and families wait in limbo for closure.</p> <p>In early April, the state of Michigan approved an order requiring physicians to certify death records within 24 hours of a known or suspected Covid death. The order was designed to speed up the process and ensure accuracy in the official death toll, but it didn\u2019t include sanctions for those who fail to comply.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not being followed,\u201d Kemp said flatly, noting that in some extreme cases it took him two or three weeks to chase down a doctor. \u201cYou\u2019re playing tag trying to catch them to sign a simple medical certification.\u201d In the worst cases, this results in a tragic treatment of the dead \u2013 residents in a Brooklyn neighborhood recently reported a foul stench emanating from a pair of trucks parked outside a black funeral home. When authorities discovered bodies inside the vans, the owner said he had run out of space.</p> <p>In mid-April, Harvell, who typically does 15 funerals a month, had 58 bodies in his care and another 16 awaiting retrieval at nearby hospitals. Before the pandemic, he could arrange burials in a matter of days. Now he\u2019s telling families he has served for years that funerals will take weeks or even as long as a month.</p> <p>\u201cA lady recently called me and said, \u2018Shawn, I\u2019ve been in this house with my mother for a whole day and a half because I can\u2019t find a funeral home that can accommodate me.\u2019\u201d Harvell couldn\u2019t turn her away. \u201cI\u2019m maxed out and I just had to take her,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At the end of the long day and night, Harvell heads home to his own family. But before he enters the house, he takes off his clothes, sprays them down and leaves everything in a bag by the door. He eats and tries to watch something on television that will distract his mind. But it\u2019s impossible to shake off the day when he knows it\u2019s all just waiting to repeat itself tomorrow.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I just want to bust out and cry,\u201d he says, thinking about what he\u2019s able to offer to families \u2013 and what he can\u2019t. \u201cWe\u2019re inundated and overwhelmed.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This story was produced in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.typeinvestigations.org/\">Type Investigations</a></p>"
