  "<p>A senior government source <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/may/07/abrupt-end-furlough-scheme-uk-\">warned yesterday</a> that people are \u201caddicted\u201d to the furlough scheme. \u201cWe have to get people back to work,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At a time when thousands of businesses and millions of workers are using the job retention scheme exactly as it was intended \u2013 to allow people to follow public health advice and stay at home \u2013 it\u2019s frustrating to hear tired cliches about \u201cdependency\u201d on state support. The scheme has kept workers in jobs and firms in business. It has widespread support from the public and private sectors and unions alike.</p> <p>Now, as the UK discusses how to get people back to work, we need to build on the furlough scheme, not cut it off. The warning lights are flashing on our economy. The Office for Budget Responsibility <a href=\"https://obr.uk/\">suggests</a> that unemployment could rise to 3.4 million, that\u2019s an unemployment rate of 10%. Since mid-March, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/universal-credit-declarations-claims-and-advances-management-information\">2.3 million people</a> have made a claim for universal credit, five times higher than usual. If we don\u2019t act now, widespread unemployment will have devastating effects on people and communities.</p> <p>We should particularly worry about young people. The <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22070491\">mass unemployment </a>of the 1980s gives us all the evidence we need to predict how unemployment could diminish their prospects. Periods out of work can have long-lasting effects on future earnings and undermine chances of getting a good job \u2013 or indeed any job at all. Young people are the ones most likely to be working in the sectors such as retail and hospitality that could face job losses. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that people aged 25 were about <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14791\">two and a half times more likely</a> to work in a sector that is now shut down than other workers.</p> <p>That parts of the UK have not recovered from Margaret Thatcher\u2019s programme of deindustrialisation and unemployment should be of concern to us all. Britain\u2019s former industrial towns still have lower employment rates and jobs with worse terms and conditions than those in other parts of the country. Further rounds of job losses could be devastating for these communities.</p> <p>But forecasts don\u2019t have to be predictions. If the government acts now, we can use what we\u2019ve learned from this crisis to prevent people and communities being thrown on the scrapheap. If we are to take any positives from this crisis, one of them should be the newfound knowledge that when necessary, we can act quickly and in coordination to face our collective challenges.</p> <p>The first step in a new plan is to build in more flexibility into the furlough scheme to enable the safe return to work we all want. At present, people who have been furloughed must be entirely off work for a minimum of three weeks. As we go back to work, the scheme should support part-time working \u2013 the best way to ensure social distancing in the workplace and gradually reduce the costs of the scheme. Unions won\u2019t stand for any plan that tries to cut costs by by asking workers on furlough to take bigger and bigger pay cuts while employers continue to benefit from government support as their workers remain on standby. </p> <p>For those thrown into uncertainty and unemployment, the government needs to raise the rate of universal credit and legacy benefits \u2013 to \u00a3260 a week. That\u2019s equivalent to the value of 80% of weekly earnings on the national living wage. People facing debt and destitution can\u2019t effectively prepare for work.</p> <p>These recently laid-off workers will be entering into a smaller jobs market, with few firms hiring. Unless the government steps in to support job creation schemes, the UK will be faced with long-term unemployment. Some will ask where those jobs will come from in these uncertain times. But we should be clear: there\u2019s no shortage of work to be done. We need a huge effort to decarbonise the economy \u2013 building new energy infrastructure, insulating our homes and changing the way we manufacture goods.</p> <p>The crisis has shown that we need a social care system that delivers the decent jobs on decent wages that both carers and those they care for deserve. Our schools, hospitals, youth services and libraries are frayed and fragile after 10 years of austerity. In a time of uncertainty, it\u2019s the government that has the greatest ability to borrow to invest, and there are plenty of things to invest in.</p> <p>A government-funded jobs guarantee scheme could be devolved to regional recovery panels, bringing together unions, business and local government leaders to make sure the scheme works for each area. And they must be open to everyone \u2013 including those groups most likely to face disadvantage and discrimination when looking for work.</p> <p>A new plan for jobs won\u2019t just support workers. Mass unemployment damages businesses, which lose customers too. It\u2019s also terrible for the public finances, because tax revenues fall. The experience of the coronavirus has shown us that we can reverse this cycle, with government stepping in to protect workers and business. Now we must take the next bold steps to prevent a return to the devastating unemployment of the past.</p> <p>\u2022 Kate Bell is head of the TUC\u2019s rights, international, social and economics department</p>",
  "<p>Black people are more than four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than white people, according to stark official figures exposing a dramatic divergence in the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in England and Wales.</p> \n<p>The Office of National Statistics found that the difference in the virus\u2019s impact was caused not only by pre-existing differences in communities\u2019 wealth, health, education and living arrangements.</p> \n<p>It discovered that after taking into account age, measures of self-reported health and disability and other socio-demographic characteristics, black people were still almost twice as likely as white people to die a Covid-19-related death.</p> \n<p>Bangladeshi and Pakistani males were 1.8 times more likely to die from Covid-19 than white males, after other pre-existing factors had been accounted for, and females from those ethnic groups were 1.6 times more likely to die from the virus than their white counterparts.</p> \n<p>The risk of Covid-19 death for people from Chinese and mixed ethnic groups was found to be similar to that for white people.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese results show that the difference between ethnic groups in Covid-19 mortality is partly a result of socio-economic disadvantage and other circumstances, but a remaining part of the difference has not yet been explained,\u201d the ONS said.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/racial-inequality-in-britain-found-a-risk-factor-for-covid-19\">Guardian research</a> last month confirmed suspicions that minority groups faced the greatest risk from the coronavirus and showed that areas with high ethnic minority populations in England and Wales tended to have higher mortality rates in the pandemic.</p> \n<p>Zubaida Haque, the deputy director of the Runnymede Trust, a race equality thinktank, described the findings as alarming. \u201cWe cannot ignore how important racial discrimination and racial inequalities, for example, in housing, are, even among poorer socio-economic groups,\u201d she said. \u201cThese factors are important but are not taken into account in most statistical modelling of Covid-19 risk factors.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/chart1-zip/giv-3902s2Bdxzz5cInD\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/chart1-zip/giv-3902s2Bdxzz5cInD\">Graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>While only 2% of white British households experienced overcrowding from 2014 to 2017, 30% of Bangladeshi households, 16% of Pakistani households and 12% of black households experienced this, according to a study of the English Housing Survey.</p> \n<p>These groups are more likely to work in frontline roles in the NHS in England: nearly 21% of staff are from ethnic minorities, compared with about 14% of the population of England and Wales. Black, Bangladeshi and Pakistani populations have been shown to face higher levels of unemployment and child poverty than white groups.</p> \n<p>Helen Barnard, the acting director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said the findings were \u201ca stark reminder that although we are all weathering the same storm, we are not all in the same boat\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/chart2-zip/giv-39029s3fnE2gDlCR/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/chart2-zip/giv-39029s3fnE2gDlCR/\">Graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWith the Bank of England now forecasting the deepest recession on record, we must ask ourselves what kind of society we want to live in after the virus passes,\u201d Barnard said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be like this. As a society that prides itself on justice and compassion, we can and must do better.\u201d</p> \n<p>The figures, covering deaths from 2 March to 10 April, are the first official snapshot of the way Covid-19 has affected different ethnic groups in England and Wales. There has been widespread concern that pre-existing health inequalities between black and minority ethnic populations \u2013 particularly in relation to cardiovascular disease and diabetes \u2013 are being amplified during the pandemic.</p> \n<p>To try to understand <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/coronavirusrelateddeathsbyethnicgroupenglandandwales2march2020to10april2020\">how much of the difference in Covid-19 morbidity was to do purely with ethnicity</a>, the statisticians adjusted for age as well as region, rural and urban classification, area deprivation, household composition, socio-economic position, highest qualification held, household tenure, and health or disability as recorded in the 2011 census.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe fully adjusted results show differences in risk between ethnic groups that are specific to those ethnic groups and are not caused by any of the factors listed on which members of the groups might differ,\u201d the ONS concluded.</p> \n<p>After all these factors were accounted for, Indian men and women were less likely than people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background to die from Covid-19, but were still 1.3 times and 1.4 times more vulnerable than white people.</p> \n<p>Chinese women were the only group to be less vulnerable than white people, after adjusting for other differences, while Chinese men were 1.2 times more likely to die from the disease than white people.</p> \n<p>The ONS also checked to see if, within ethnic groups, socio-economic class made a difference. They found that the differences in risk of Covid-19-related death across ethnic groups were of similar magnitudes within all three socio-economic classes.</p> \n<p>The differences in the risk of dying from Covid-19 could be driven by factors not included in its model, the ONS acknowledged.</p> \n<p>Some groups may be over-represented in public-facing occupations and could be more likely to be infected by Covid-19 . About 12.8% of workers from Bangladeshi and Pakistani backgrounds work in public-facing transport jobs such as bus, coach and taxi driving, compared with 3.5% of white people. The ONS said it plans to conduct further work to identify occupations that are particularly at risk.</p> \n<p>A study released on Thursday analysing the NHS health records of 17.4 million UK adults gave further insights into the possible causes of the increased risk for people from BAME backgrounds. Like the ONS data, the study found that people of black and Asian backgrounds were at higher risk of death, and it ruled out the idea that this was largely due to higher rates of underlying medical problems in these groups.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople have very reasonably speculated that the increased risk among BME people might be due to people having higher risk of cardiovascular disease or diabetes,\u201d said Ben Goldacre, the director of the DataLab in the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences at the University of Oxford, who co-led on the study. \u201cOur analysis shows that is actually not the case. That is not the explanation. We\u2019ve been able to exclude one of the current preferred explanations for why BME people face higher risk.\u201d</p> \n<p>The authors called for further research on the contribution of occupational risk and whether people from BAME backgrounds were placed at increased risk of exposure and infection. The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, found that people from deprived social backgrounds were also at a higher risk, and again this finding could not be explained by other risk factors.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Wasim Hanif, a professor of diabetes and endocrinology at University Hospital Birmingham, said the ONS data was not robust enough to give the full reasons for the difference in the likelihood of dying from Covid-19.</p> \n<p>The research accounts for health problems reported by people who filled in the 2011 census, but Hanif said differences in the extent of other underlying diseases in different ethnic groups in Britain \u2013 so-called co-morbidities \u2013 which have not been accounted for by the ONS, may be significant.</p> \n<p>For example, in the UK people of Pakistani and Bangladeshi descent are three to four times more likely to get diabetes earlier in life than white people, and the ratio is between two and three for black and Indian-origin people, he said.</p> \n<p>However deprivation, which is a strong predictor for ill-health, was factored into the ONS analysis, so it remains unclear how much the inclusion of co-morbidities would change the results.</p> \n<p>The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cThis virus has sadly appeared to have a disproportionate effect on people from BAME backgrounds. It is critical we find out which groups are most at risk so we can take the right steps to protect them and minimise their risk.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have commissioned Public Health England to better understand the different factors, such as ethnicity, obesity and geographical location that may influence the effects of the virus.\u201d</p>",

But we <em>have</em> been conditioned to erase the contribution of ethnic minorities to our national identity.</p> <p>The last time we were in a period of national crisis, a settlement \u2013 a social contract \u2013 was reached between the state and the British people.

The millions of Africans, Asians and other people who came to be regarded as \u201cethnic minorities\u201d (though they weren\u2019t a minority in the empire) \u2013 and who made both this wartime victory, and the new welfare state institutions possible \u2013 were not part of the story.</p> <p>And what followed shows that when you exclude people from the narrative, they become excluded in real life. The idea of being entitled to a share in Britishness, and its national wealth, erased the contribution of black, Asian and ethnic minority people.

Yet that same postwar era also laid the foundations for the inadequate access to healthcare, housing and secure labour that must be part of the reason why minorities are so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/01/why-bame-people-may-be-more-at-risk-from-coronavirus-video-explainer\">disproportionately affected</a> by today\u2019s coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>Britain has long needed a new social contract, a new consensual agreement between the government and the governed, that sets out updated values and expectations. Maybe now \u2013 as even a Conservative government is forced to be radically redistributive, with conditional bailouts offering the prospect of more fiscally and socially responsible business, and the NHS becoming an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/pots-pans-passion-britons-clap-their-support-for-nhs-workers-again\">emotional part of Britain\u2019s identity</a> once more \u2013 we might get one.</p> <p>The difference between this moment and the social contract of 75 years ago, is that this time the service and sacrifice of ethnic minority people in Britain is impossible to ignore. It\u2019s clear that racial injustice deserves a central place in our new settlement.</p> <p>Yet despite this, black and Asian individuals with questionable positions on racial justice have suddenly found themselves promoted. Munira Mirza \u2013 who opposed Theresa May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/theresa-may-s-phoney-race-war-is-dangerous-and-divisive\">racial disparities audit</a> \u2013 is now <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/03/whos-charge-inside-no-10-maverick-advisers-running-britain\">head of policy</a> at No 10. And Trevor Phillips, the former equalities chief who was suspended from the Labour party over <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51797316\">accusations of Islamophobia</a>, was appointed to the Covid-19 inquiry \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/coronavirus-medics-condemn-trevor-phillips-role-investigating-uk-ethnic-minority-deaths\">provoking </a><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/coronavirus-medics-condemn-trevor-phillips-role-investigating-uk-ethnic-minority-deaths\">protests</a> from many of the black and minority NHS workers whose trust the inquiry most needs. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the government steadfastly refuses to revisit the utterly <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/uk-migrant-workers-desperate-need-crucial-financial-support-during-covid-19-pandemic\">draconian ban on migrant workers</a> \u2013 including those serving the public on the coronavirus frontline \u2013 accessing public funds, leading to warnings of a new epidemic of destitution.</p> <p>And we now witness the remarkable full circle of Britain recruiting foreigners to carry out essential work, whether in agriculture or the NHS. It\u2019s just like the last time \u2013 when Enoch Powell was among the first to ask Caribbean nurses to come and work in the NHS before turning to race hate. But this time it\u2019s taking place quietly, so we can continue the national pastime of deluding ourselves that Britain can survive without immigrants, while our very survival depends on their labour.</p> <p>Before the virus hit, Britishness as an identity had drifted into a dark place of dishonesty and cognitive dissonance, where we correctly identified that something had broken down, but blamed minorities and outsiders, rather than the betrayal of a promise.</p> <p>Now we have an opportunity to correct that wrong, by acknowledging that we will all be worse off, whatever our colour, unless racial justice and equality lies at the heart of our shared future.</p> <p>\u2022 Afua Hirsch is a Guardian columnist</p>"
