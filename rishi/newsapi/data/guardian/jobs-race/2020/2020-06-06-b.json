  "<p>It was always likely that the months of lockdown would demand some kind of emotional catharsis. You imagined it would involve the usual British excesses of lager and sunshine. In fact, in the past week its primary expression has been a coming together of mostly young people in our cities under the banner of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/03/sing-his-name-thousands-gather-in-london-for-george-floyd-protest-video\">Black Lives Matter</a>.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, in by far the largest of the week\u2019s demonstrations in London, many thousands crammed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/uk-anti-racism-protesters-defy-calls-to-avoid-mass-gatherings\">shoulder to shoulder in Parliament Square</a> in the blustery rain and edged their way forwards toward St James\u2019s Park. On Friday, police and government ministers had warned that such a crowd was not only unlawful but certainly dangerous with the virus still being transmitted from person to person.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/london-blmprotestmap/giv-3902U2Uxjs9pN79W/\" data-alt=\".\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/london-blmprotestmap/giv-3902U2Uxjs9pN79W/\">.</a> \n</figure> \n<p>In the midst of that crowd \u2013 an unnatural human feeling in itself for all those who have been in isolation \u2013 it was impossible not to feel that those warnings should have been heeded far more closely. But for the vast majority of those that came, the risk had seemed worth it. Some of the banners in Parliament Square made their argument succinctly: \u201cRacism has always been a pandemic.\u201d</p> \n<p>As well as looking like the premature end of a shutdown spring in the capital, the protest also felt very much like the beginning of something; not a one-off outpouring of rage against the brutal killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis 12 days ago, but a sustainable expression of the need for change.</p> \n<p>There was an urgency about that demand, as well as a weariness. Innumerable wounds have been opened by the graphic video of Floyd\u2019s death, stretching back in British memories over generations \u2013 the protesters\u2019 banners were a roll call of past and current injustice. Actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/04/john-boyega-challenged-racism-movie-star-hyde-park-speech\">John Boyega</a>\u2019s heartfelt speech to the demonstrators on Wednesday made those links explicit: \u201cWe are a physical representation of our support for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> \u2026 We are a physical representation of our support for Stephen Lawrence.\u201d His words were carried on many of the cardboard signs held aloft: \u201cNow is the time. I ain\u2019t waiting.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4c258162-0039-486c-a94d-4c2b9d3ab04f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sn2i0wfM2h0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>That sentiment, which has spread through cities across the world, was never likely to be postponed by demands for physical distancing. The loose network of Black Lives Matter activists who have coordinated last week\u2019s protests across the UK did their best to mitigate the risks in the crowd. They came equipped here with stocks of free masks and sanitiser. Imarn Ayton, 29, one of those coordinators, kicked off proceedings through a loudhailer: \u201cWe are not here for violence. If you commit violence today you are not for the cause. I don\u2019t want to see no alcohol. I don\u2019t want to see no weed. This is not a carnival. And keep your distance. You don\u2019t need me to say that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-racial-disparities-african-americans\">coronavirus is killing black people</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>For many hours her hopes for a peaceful protest were realised, but&nbsp;in late afternoon there were clashes between protesters and police and one officer appeared to be knocked off their horse, which then bolted \u2013 sending crowds of people scattering [see footnote].&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9489d50ddc1604810cd7c6625732eabab4442ca\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9489d50ddc1604810cd7c6625732eabab4442ca/138_0_4053_2434/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protester\u2019s face mask in London echoes the final words of George Floyd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester\u2019s face mask in London echoes the final words of George Floyd.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Augstein/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When I spoke to Ayton, 29, she said they had expected 20,000 to come. The eventual number appeared several times greater. What was not in doubt was that last week had marked a new phase of momentum in a long campaign. \u201cI\u2019ve always been involved,\u201d she said of a movement that has its genesis in the protest against the decision not to prosecute the killer of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trayvon-martin\">Trayvon Martin</a> in 2013. \u201cTo be honest anyone who is black and passionate is involved. But it feels like a different moment. The death of George Floyd and the protest has inspired many more people to speak up, black, white, everyone. The difference we are seeing is people are no longer prepared to be ignorant; they want to educate themselves.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5f1ed2beb04f5172159ab102509e2158f5ae796\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5f1ed2beb04f5172159ab102509e2158f5ae796/756_0_2773_2788/995.jpg\" alt=\"Da Vinci, a DJ from Brixton\" width=\"995\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Da Vinci, a DJ from Brixton.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A lot of the people I spoke to suggested that this was their first march. They acknowledged the risks of the crowd, but felt they had no real choice. A young black woman from north London, who didn\u2019t wish to give her name was holding a sign saying \u201cYour silence is violence\u201d and sitting at the foot of Gandhi\u2019s statue. \u201cThe facts haven\u2019t changed,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the difference is more people are listening. I see it on social media, everyone that I know has been posting about this. And if you are young and you are not speaking up now, then it definitely says who you are. They don\u2019t have to be here physically because we are in the middle of a pandemic, but if they are not here mentally and in spirit, well fuck \u2019em.\u201d</p> \n<p>Terence Niemi, 28, from Colchester was also a first-time protester. \u201cI felt like I should be here, there was no real choice this time. But it shouldn\u2019t take losing another person\u2019s life for us to form together. Hopefully in future we can make these kind of movements without this situation going down.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You only have to look at the images on the internet to know why people are enraged</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Fatima Abdulrahman</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Da Vinci, a DJ from Brixton, said: \u201cAsking people \u2018stop oppressing us\u2019 doesn\u2019t really make much sense to me. But when you see people coming out together all around the world hopefully we can unite around that and find something positive out of it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fatima Abdulrahman had been on two previous protests last week. \u201cYou only have to look at the images on the internet to know why people are enraged,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a lot of anger; people are not OK with how things are and there is a lot of pain to process.\u201d She suggested the grimness of the last few weeks has also motivated that change; isolation itself has sharpened the issues. \u201cPeople have been at home, often alone for several months hearing about people dying, and a disproportionate number of them have been black people. And a disproportionate amount of black people have been suffering economically. That is another reason why we are here.\u201d</p> \n<p>The summer looks likely to pitch those demands for social justice squarely against public health. The first test of that clash will be on Sunday afternoon when marchers have been invited to reassemble outside the US embassy in Vauxhall.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This footnote was added on 8 June 2020 to note that the police officer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/06/coronavirus-live-news-china-warns-of-covid-linked-racial-violence-overseas?page=with:block-5edbfbc78f083999a26db50f#block-5edbfbc78f083999a26db50f\">fell from her horse after hitting a traffic light</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

  "<p>Lachlan Beel, 17, was just over a year into his four-year apprenticeship as an engineering machinist when he got some bad news.</p> <p>His employer, which runs a machine shop and foundry in the Ipswich region of south-east Queensland, told him his apprenticeship was being cancelled because work had dried up amid the coronavirus crisis and it was likely to stay sluggish for at least six to 12 months.</p> <p>Hearing the news from the HR rep last month was a blow because Lachlan had really enjoyed learning new skills and making friends at the work site.

The number of new apprenticeships and traineeships is expected to decline by 30% within two years, according to research from the Mitchell Institute at Victoria University.</p> <p>That equates to about 130,000 fewer new apprentices and trainees between the start of the pandemic and mid-2023. The number of currently enrolled apprentices and trainees is also tipped to go down.</p> <p>The Mitchell Institute education policy fellow, Peter Hurley, says apprentices are highly affected by what\u2019s happening in the wider economy, because employers are reluctant to commit to a three- or four-year placement at a time of economic uncertainty.</p> <p>This trend could see young people drop out of the workforce or training system altogether and lead to skills shortages down the track.</p> <p>\u201cThese are really quite disastrous, cascading effects,\u201d Hurley says.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s education spokesperson, Tanya Plibersek, also worries about the implications. \u201cThe number of apprentices and trainees has been in decline for seven years, but without serious government action things are about to get a whole lot worse,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIf the government fails to intervene, apprentice and trainee numbers will fall off a cliff \u2013 we will lose a generation.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/australian-content-must-be-a-major-part-of-a-clean-energy-led-economic-recovery\">If clean energy is to drive Australia's economic recovery, let's keep it local | Simon Corbell</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>The skills the nation needs</strong></h2> <p>The concerns about apprentices come at a time when the government has vowed to reform the broader skills and training sector. Scott Morrison, in a National Press Club address last month, said the system was \u201cclunky and unresponsive to skills demands\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to have this system more focused on what it\u2019s actually supposed to do, and that is that someone who\u2019s looking for training can get trained with skills that an employer might actually want,\u201d the prime minister said.</p> <p>The Australian Industry Group agrees. Its chief executive, Innes Willox, says developing skills to drive the post-Covid-19 recovery will be vital, but the vocational education and training (VET) system \u201calready struggles to deliver the skills that the economy needs\u201d.</p> <p>Willox says while many of the training products are \u201cfine\u201d, the resources are too often out of date and inflexible. Training providers make selections that best suit their staffing profile and funding received, not the requirements of the local labour market.</p> <p>\u201cEmployers are left feeling that their needs and those of the economy have not been met,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Plibersek contends the whole post-high school system needs fundamental reform. Australia\u2019s training system, she says, has been neglected and undervalued for too long. And students are \u201cpaying more for qualifications that often fail to prepare them for good quality, secure jobs\u201d.</p> <p>Plibersek says the training system can only be excellent when the public provider, Tafe, is well funded, yet it has suffered from funding cuts over the past seven years.</p> <p>Australia needs training courses that lay good foundations for long-term careers, not short-term, insecure jobs, she adds.&nbsp;\u201cThe best way to do that is to directly involve employers, unions and Tafe teachers, so people are being well trained for good jobs available in their local cities and towns.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/05/coalition-governments-homebuilder-grants-for-renovations-and-building-criticised-by-economists-and-backbench-mps\">Coalition government's grants for renovations and building criticised by economists and backbench MPs</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Lowest spending in more than a decade</strong></h2> <p>Across the nation, the total reported spending on the VET sector is now at its lowest level in more than a decade, although the federal government is playing a bigger role than it did 10 years ago, according to a recent report by the Mitchell Institute.</p> <p>\u201cGood intentions and bad policy\u201d is how Hurley describes the funding trends. Attempts to open up the sector 10 years ago were done in a flawed manner, he says, and then some states were accused of taking advantage of federal funding to reduce their own contributions.</p> <p>Morrison has left the door open to increasing the $1.5bn component funded by the federal government \u2013 with conditions. His interest, he says, is in \u201cinvestment that goes somewhere\u201d.</p> <p>Likewise, the Productivity Commission suggests the $6.1bn in VET funding provided by federal and state governments each year needs to be more focused on helping students get the training they need.</p> <p>In a report published on Friday, it points to differences in the delivery of one of the most popular VET courses \u2013 the certificate 3 in individual support, which qualifies people to work in aged and disability care. This varies in cost around Australia, it says, with the standard subsidy differing by as much as $3,700.</p> <p>Jonathan Coppel, a productivity commissioner, says the pandemic driving Australia into recession only increases the urgency of tackling the \u201cbig reform questions\u201d in vocational education.</p> <p>\u201cNow must be that moment,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/04/australian-universities-to-close-campuses-and-shed-thousands-of-jobs-as-revenue-plummets-due-to-covid-19-crisis\">Australian universities to close campuses and shed thousands of jobs as revenue plummets due to Covid-19 crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>\u2018Not business as usual\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The federal government says it is focusing on three key issues: the complexity of the VET system and its responsiveness to skills demands; the lack of clear information about industry skills needs; and improving the funding arrangements that are marred by inconsistencies and incoherence, with little accountability back to outcomes.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Michaelia Cash, the minister for employment, skills, small and family business, says the government wants to renegotiate the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development because it \u201csees the federal government hand over $1.5bn in untied funding each year with no oversight of how the money is spent, or what the efficient price for different training courses actually is\u201d.</p> <p>The National Skills Commission will provide the government with advice on funding and will also work on improving labour market forecasting, \u201chelping us identify where the jobs of tomorrow will be, and how to train for them\u201d.</p> <p>But Hurley cautions against getting too prescriptive when it comes to the particular skills that are needed, saying we should also consider the rich learning experience that a student gains from training.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting when industry comes along and says things like we want job-ready graduates.

The proposal is timed to kick in from the expiry of the jobkeeper scheme.</p> <p>But the benefits of such schemes have come under fresh scrutiny, with the Productivity Commission <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/05/little-evidence-wage-subsidies-boost-apprenticeships-productivity-commission-says\">warning in its latest report</a> that there is \u201clittle evidence that incentive payments to employers to train trade apprentices have been effective in increasing enrolments\u201d.</p> <p>Lachlan is just hoping for action to help apprentices like him.

  "<p>The outrage that has gripped many nations in the wake of the death of George Floyd is likely to have been fuelled by resentment over Covid-19\u2019s extreme impact on black communities, one of the world\u2019s top health experts warned on Saturday.</p> <p>David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College London, said the disease was now having a disproportionately severe impact on the most disadvantaged sections of those nations that had been the slowest to tackle the pandemic and who now have the worst infection rates.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the anger now being expressed among people of colour may be traced to the fact they have actually had to carry the brunt of this,\u201d said Nabarro, who is also an envoy for the World Health Organization on Covid-19.&nbsp;</p> <p>Nabarro said the problems posed by the coronavirus had been exacerbated by heads of state who had initially presented the disease as a mild threat. The US was a clear example of a country that had failed to react quickly to the appearance of the disease. Other western nations were also at fault, he added.</p> <p>As a result, the virus spread quickly to communities whose members could least protect themselves from infection. \u201cCommunities of black and poor people have been exposed to excess risk because it is much harder for them to take sick leave or to protect themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are bearing the brunt of this disease.</p> <p>\u201cMany countries did respond quickly to protect citizens from Covid. But in other countries, heads of state made light of the threat. That is why the United States and some other western countries face a much bigger challenge compared with those that acted with speed.\u201d</p> <p>The crucial point is that black people and poor people in these countries have had to continue working throughout the pandemic, triggering resentment that may have helped fuel the current racial protests that have swept many nations, he suggested. \u201cAll this is happening at a time when there is a heightened sense of injustice among people of colour,\u201d said Nabarro.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/05/lack-of-response-to-bame-covid-19-toll-risks-fuelling-tensions-say-mps\">Lack of response to BAME Covid-19 toll risks fuelling tensions, say MPs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn Kansas, black people are dying at seven times the rate of white people while in Washington and New York their death rate is three times the rate for white people.

When this danger was revealed, Germany swiftly introduced measures to protect workers.

  "<p>In 2016, when I finished writing <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/14/the-return-father-sons-and-the-land-in-between-hisham-matar-review\">The Return</a></em>, a book about my journey back to Libya after 33 years of not being able to go there for political reasons, and my failed search for my father, a Libyan political dissident who was imprisoned and made to disappear by the Gaddafi dictatorship, I went to Siena. I spent a month in the Tuscan city looking at paintings from the Sienese School, which covers the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. Works from this period have interested me ever since I first saw them at the National Gallery in London, some quarter of a century before, when I was 19, the very year my father was abducted. Something about their availability and vitality appealed to me. The time I spent in Siena provided a space to consider the connections between love and loss, death and art.</p> <p>The Sienese School, which sits between the waning influence of the eastern church and the Renaissance, was dramatically changed by the 1348 plague, the Black Death. That pandemic was the most devastating incident in human history. It altered not only human society but the imagination itself. Its traces can be perceived today, and perhaps more lucidly during these difficult days. With their lack of modern technology, the 14th-century Sienese were even more incredulous than we have shown ourselves to be in the early days of the coronavirus crisis. The speed of the Black Death was so staggering that in just over a year it had conquered the known medieval world, reducing the population of each country by an average of 45%. To the Sienese artists, who were engaged in a fruitful competitive collaboration with one another and had established a supportive infrastructure of apprenticeships to train young artists, the carnage seemed very far away and the reports were so wild and grotesque that they could scarcely be believed. But then when they heard that Sicily had fallen, it became obvious that there would be no escape. Fear and hysteria gripped Siena. Some people ran into the countryside; others, believing themselves safer inside the metropolis, rushed to enter through one of the many gates that surrounded the city like open mouths.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Vermeer were all threatened by the Black Death. It is thought that Titian died of it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Before Italy became a nation, it was made up of a collection of city-states governed by <em>un\u2019autorit\u00e0 superior</em>, in the form of a powerful noble family or a bishop. Siena was an exception in that it favoured civic rule. This partly accounts for the unique character of its art. It produced Ambrogio Lorenzetti\u2019s <em>The Allegory of Good and Bad Government,</em> a series of frescos housed in the Palazzo Pubblico, the civic heart of the city. It is one of the earliest and most significant secular paintings we have. If civic rule were a church, this would be its altarpiece. Siena also imbued its artists with a rare and humanist curiosity that, even in their depictions of religious scenes, involved them in meditations on human psychology and ideas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78247d5eed9924459535bd866e2e0875e7b71b03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78247d5eed9924459535bd866e2e0875e7b71b03/442_0_6259_3759/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Excerpt from The Allegory of the Good and Bad Government.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A detail from The Allegory of the Good and Bad Government.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heritage Image Partnership Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This changed with the arrival of the Black Death.<em> </em>The Sienese, like their medieval European Christian counterparts, suffered under the conviction that all diseases came from God. They took the Black Death as proof of their guilt. In the 14th-century Middle English narrative poem<em> Piers Plowman,</em> William Langland puts the matter succinctly: \u201cThese pestilences were for pure sin.\u201d The Tuscan poet Petrarch, observing the abandoned bodies of the dead, wrote: \u201cOh happy people of the future, who have not known these miseries and perchance will class our testimony with the fables. We have, indeed, deserved these [punishments] and even greater.\u201d The church encouraged such supernatural explanations. Many priests refused to bless the infected on the grounds that they were receiving God\u2019s punishment. Most of the believers devoted themselves to prayer and penitential practices, repairing churches and setting up religious houses. The papacy became more powerful. Ideas and the very structure of people\u2019s values shifted.</p> <p>The 1348 Black Death and its various proceeding reoccurrences, shaped our attitudes to death and dying and, by implication, to life and living across the world. Ibn Khald\u016bn, the Tunisian historian and historiographer credited with pioneering the field of sociology, lost his parents to the plague. To him it was an event of immense global importance, but also a personal affront. It drove him to conclude that the Black Death exposed profound weaknesses in human civilisation. His was a pre-Darwinian Darwinian view, and he wanted to see the opportunities in the tragedy. It made life seem, he wrote, \u201cas if it were a pristine and repeated creation, a world brought into existence anew\u201d. Indeed, the plague was destructive but also generative. The flowering of the Renaissance and the baroque took place in its shadow. Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Vermeer were all periodically threatened by it. It is thought that Titian died of it. And it entered their minds, tinged their thinking, and made death a familiar and inescapable guest, the silent companion who will inevitably have the last word. The imagination began to focus on the end of things. \u201cNo thought is born in me which has not \u2018Death\u2019 engraved upon it,\u201d Michelangelo wrote in a letter to Vasari.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3c5a2e8a689e68d81f7015a9550098df64d90a29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c5a2e8a689e68d81f7015a9550098df64d90a29/0_204_4252_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I thought I had gone to Siena simply to look at art\u2019 \u2026 Hisham Matar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I thought I had gone to Siena simply to look at art\u2019 \u2026 Hisham Matar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The religious fervour the Black Death inspired in Siena instilled a powerful commitment to the church. Barely seven years had passed when, in 1355, the city\u2019s civic rule ended. The clergy now were the principal clients. They had a great deal of money and influence. They determined what was painted. They commissioned a new chapel down the corridor from Ambrogio Lorenzetti\u2019s <em>The Allegory of Good and Bad Government</em>. Taddeo di Bartolo, the artist assigned to decorate the walls of the chapel, had a big task to fulfil. He needed to revive and carry forth the Sienese tradition as well as reinvent it and make it more adaptable to the tastes of the new patron. His depictions of the death of the Virgin, pictures concerned with the end of things, is a register that was not up to then central to Sienese art. It is impossible to look at <em>The Funeral of the Virgin </em>and not think of it as containing the memory of the dead of Siena, the bodies piled high on pavements because there was no place to bury them. Each of the Apostles carrying the Virgin as well as the onlookers seem utterly alone, as though touched by the thought of death. The whole chapel is a fabulous and contradictory performance of repentance and excess. Every surface \u2013 every centimetre of floor, wall and ceiling space \u2013 is decorated.

Waybrant is worried about whether it will even be possible to live off Tennessee\u2019s maximum weekly unemployment payout of $275. &nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to sit and wait and see,\u201d Waybrant said of her future plans. \u201cA lot of my answer depends on what healthcare [I get]&nbsp;from my job.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018They need to do something about this system\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Ivette Cruz&nbsp;</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"77fd7090775f398428d7744d0a7d5e5714fcc01c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77fd7090775f398428d7744d0a7d5e5714fcc01c/277_0_1428_1428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A photo of Ivette Cruz\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Ivette Cruz of Kissimmee, Florida felt a wave of relief when three weeks of unemployment insurance came in the middle of May after she was laid off from her two jobs at a&nbsp;food service company and at the retailer JC Penney, which has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/15/jc-penney-bankruptcy-retail-business-us-economy\">gone bankrupt.</a> For weeks, she spent hours simply trying to get her application into the system \u2013 a struggle many Floridians experienced when dealing with an overwhelmed, antiquated online system.&nbsp;</p> <p>But since the first payments came in mid-May, Cruz says, no others have arrived. To restart those payments Cruz needs to log into the online system and confirm that she is willing and able to work, but the online system is still faulty. Whenever she tries to log in, it keeps booting her out.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThere was relief for a couple of weeks, but now we\u2019re back to square one. A little bit different, but it\u2019s almost the same,\u201d Cruz says.</p> <p>Whenever she tries to call the state for help trying to get through the system, the operators do not know how to help her.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a poll of more than 4,500 unemployed workers conducted by Unite Here, a union that represents hospitality workers, in Florida, only 16% of respondents said they had received their payment. Most have had some of their payments, like Ivette, while 30% have received no payments at all.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cruz is worried about how she will be able to pay her bills, especially her mortgage payments which are already three weeks behind. \u201cIt\u2019s not only me. There are a lot more people out there that are suffering and struggling,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThey need to do something about this system.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>\u2018It\u2019s very stressful\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Yolanda Murray</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1842124ea8162fabb85885667717401c52675581\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1842124ea8162fabb85885667717401c52675581/189_655_1685_1685/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of Yolanda Murray\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Yolanda Murray, who was laid off her from her job as lead steward at a Westin Hotel in Detroit, Michigan, has been getting her unemployment insurance steadily since April after a fight to get through the unemployment system.&nbsp;</p> <p>Next month, Murray will have to apply again to extend her insurance. \u201cI\u2019m just praying I don\u2019t have a difficult time sending it,\u201d Murray says.</p> <p>While her hotel has not mentioned a specific date they could reopen, Marriott, the hotel\u2019s parent company, has indicated to employees that its hotel will probably not reopen until October.&nbsp;</p> <p>Murray is worried about when and if she will be able to return to work, how she will be able to pay her bills and whether her health insurance will get cut off. \u201cIt\u2019s very stressful,\u201d says Murray.</p>",
  "<p>In only 48 hours, ants took over one of our new compost bins. Lifting the lid to chuck in some wilted celery stumps, I saw them seething over what looked like a heap of nude baked beans.</p> <p>They weren\u2019t baked beans but pupae, wrapped in beige silk.

When I looked later, the \u201cbeans\u201d had all gone.</p> <p>Although it seemed as if the ants arrived suddenly from nowhere, there must have been a small nest in the ground nearby. Black garden ants favour dry places that are warmed by the sun. They often build under stones or paving slabs that will heat up during the day and act like storage heaters at night.&nbsp;</p> <p>Colonies are adept at managing temperatures inside the nest. They form mounds of excavated soil granules, pieced with tunnels that absorb heat and aerate the chambers within. Workers move eggs, larvae and pupae so that the brood has the right degree of warmth. During the day, they carry it to the upper levels. As the air cools at nightfall, they take it deeper into the nest.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/28/flying-ant-day-virgin-queens-male-drones-mate-on-the-wing\">Flying ant day: when virgin queens and male drones mate on the wing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These are one of the commonest UK ant species.
