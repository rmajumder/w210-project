  "<p>Organisers of anti-racism protests in the UK have accused the police of unfairly targeting black people during the lockdown and called for further demonstrations this week.</p> <p>Protests took place in London, Cardiff, Manchester and Nottingham on Saturday and Sunday against the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">killing last week of George Floyd</a> by a white police officer in Minnesota, which has led to widespread unrest across the US.</p> <p>As well as showing solidarity with demonstrators in the US, Britons have expressed anger and frustration at the increased use of stop and search during the lockdown in areas with large black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) populations.</p> <p>The Guardian revealed last week that BAME people in England were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/bame-people-fined-more-than-white-population-under-coronavirus-laws\">54% more likely to be fined under coronavirus rules</a> than white people.</p> <p>British demonstrations were called spontaneously by young black people who are not affiliated with any organisations. They said they wanted to shine a spotlight on the impact of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/windrush-institutional-racism-hostile-environment\">institutional racism</a> in the UK.</p> <p>During the protests, the rallying cry that \u201cthe UK is not innocent\u201d was accompanied by Black Lives Matter banners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a81c88b64d0bb42234ab869773527adc3f93313\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a81c88b64d0bb42234ab869773527adc3f93313/0_98_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters in Westminster\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters in Westminster on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ollie Millngton/RMV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A police source&nbsp;told the Guardian a single incident such as video circulating on social media of alleged police heavy-handedness could be the spark for trouble and described the atmosphere as tinder dry: \u201cI worry about the effect over here of what\u2019s going on in the US. One incident, and it could kick off.\u201d</p> <p>Aima, 18, who did not wish to give her last name, was one of the organisers of a protest in London on Sunday. She said: \u201cI started the #LDNBLM hashtag and it blew off. I didn\u2019t expect that to happen. What inspired me was how much pain I\u2019ve suffered while in the UK. I moved here from Nigeria when I was 10 and as soon as I came here I experienced a lot of discrimination from the police and from people around me. People need to understand in the UK, we\u2019re suffering too.\u201d</p> <p>The protest was not associated with the more established group Black Lives Matter UK. A spokesperson for the group said: \u201cAlthough we are supporting newly founded groups in their demonstrations, we are currently not calling protests due to the life-threatening reality of the pandemic, which is killing members of our communities at a rate far greater than their white counterparts. We are the first to work, first to die and now, first to fight.\u201d</p> <p>The Met has increased &nbsp;stop&nbsp;and searches by 50% in a year. In April 2019 Met officers carried out 20,981 stops. This April, with lockdown fully in place, 30,608 stops were carried out. The Met says one in five searches led to further action being taken</p> <p>Demonstrations follow recent high-profile stop and searches in the capital, including on an ambulance driver waiting for his friend in south London, which prompted Jovan Nepaul, the chair of Lewisham Deptford constituency Labour party, to write to the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, expressing his concern about \u201cthe disproportionate policing of black people in our area\u201d.</p> <p>Trey Campbell-Simon, the BAME officer for the Chelsea and Fulham Labour party, said he attended a rally on Sunday to show solidarity with victims of police violence in the US. \u201cI also attended because the British police are not innocent. There is a long history with the British police using excessive force with black people, you only have to look at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/26/man-accused-of-starting-2011-london-riots-mark-duggan\">killing of Mark Duggan</a> for one example,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said: \u201cWe understand there are concerns across some communities that the use of the stop-and-search tactic during the Covid-19 lockdown has been deliberately aimed at certain groups. We would like to reassure communities that this is absolutely not the case.<br><br>\u201cHowever, our use of stop and search over recent weeks has increased as additional resources have been placed into proactive patrols to tackle crime and keep London safe during this challenging period.\u201d</p> <p>Protesters say the demonstrations go much further than a protest against policing operations during lockdown.</p> <p>Another organiser, who wished to remain anonymous, said there had been widespread anger over recent government failures that had affected the BAME population.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a whole load of people who have directly been affected by the unlawful murders and unjust treatment of our brothers and sisters worldwide, but it\u2019s also more than that. It\u2019s looking at things like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/16/grenfell-tower-price-britain-inequality-high-rise\">Grenfell</a>, it\u2019s looking at things like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/windrush-institutional-racism-hostile-environment\">Windrush </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/windrush-institutional-racism-hostile-environment\">scandal</a>,\u201d the 22-year-old said. \u201cWe are here to stay, we\u2019re not just a blip in the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Further protests are planned in London on Saturday and Sunday. A demonstration on Wednesday at Hyde Park aims \u201cto demand justice for George Floyd and a public inquiry here in Britain into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/bame-dying-coronavirus-sadiq-khan\">disproportionate BAME deaths during the Covid-19 crisis</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Weyman Bennett, the <a href=\"https://www.standuptoracism.org.uk/\">Stand Up To Racism</a> national co-convenor, said: \u201cIn the UK we\u2019ve seen a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/08/manchester-police-taser-man-with-child-iopc-stretford\">black man </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/08/manchester-police-taser-man-with-child-iopc-stretford\">Tasered in front of his child in Manchester</a> this month while Tory adviser Dominic Cummings gets away scot-free.\u201d</p> <p>Demonstrators last weekend also demanded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/12/uk-rail-worker-dies-coronavirus-spat-belly-mujinga\">justice for Belly Mujinga</a>, a 47-year-old railway ticket office worker who died after contracting Covid-19 after being spat at while on duty. The British&nbsp;Transport&nbsp;Police announced last week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/29/police-close-case-of-rail-workers-covid-19-death-after-spitting-incident\">no further action would be taken</a>.</p> <p>Edan, 17, who plans to attend the next wave of protests in London, said events over the past decade had awoken her generation to widespread inequalities in the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s forcing people to see we live completely different lives, even if we live in the same area and go to the same school. We are leading two completely different realities.\u201d</p> <p>The Met said there were 23 arrests at the demonstrations in London on Sunday. \u201cThe arrests were for a variety of offences including breaching the Covid-19 legislation, assault on an emergency worker, possession of an offensive weapon and breach of the peace. The ages of those arrested ranged from 17 to 30 years.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office said in a statement it had \u201cput in place measures to ensure that policing is subject to appropriate levels of transparency and accountability \u2013 with regular inspections of the way forces engage with communities, frequent publication of data on use of police powers and strengthening the police complaints system.</p> <p>\u201cIf an officer does commit a serious breach of the standards expected of them, disciplinary proceedings and, if appropriate, criminal proceedings should follow.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 June 2020. The organisation Stand Up To Racism has called for a day of action on Wednesday 3 June, but is not involved in the Hyde Park demonstration as an earlier version had said.</p>",
  "<p>Government lawyers have tried and failed to remove the name of Dominic Cummings from a sex discrimination claim being pursued by Sajid Javid\u2019s former special adviser, the Guardian can disclose.</p> <p>The demand was rejected after barristers for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/01/adviser-sacked-by-cummings-may-have-case-for-unfair-dismissal-expert\">Sonia Khan, the former chancellor\u2019s media adviser</a> who was marched by armed police from Downing Street, successfully argued that the behaviour of Boris Johnson\u2019s chief aide was pivotal to the case.</p> <p>The disclosure will be seen as an attempt by the government to protect Cummings from further controversy. He is facing demands for his resignation after the Guardian revealed that he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/durham-police-believe-cummings-probably-did-break-lockdown-rules\">driven hundreds of miles across the UK</a> during the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>It also means that Cummings could be made personally liable for part of any damages award.</p> <p>Khan was Javid\u2019s media adviser at the time she was escorted from No 10 after Cummings accused her of misleading him over her contact with individuals close to the former chancellor Philip Hammond. She denied any inappropriate contact. Javid was furious to learn about her dismissal after the event.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"25b3a05d764fe8104e4ef1e3e0ca644008331835\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25b3a05d764fe8104e4ef1e3e0ca644008331835/0_0_1732_2164/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sonia Khan\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sonia Khan was escorted from No 10 after Dominic Cummings accused her of lying about contact with one of Philip Hammond\u2019s former staff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At an employment tribunal hearing in central London, a judge set the case for a five-day hearing in December at which the relationship between Cummings and Johnson will be scrutinised.</p> <p>Barristers for Khan named Cummings as a respondent in the case, which also includes an unfair dismissal claim. It is understood that the government\u2019s solicitors attempted to argue that his name should be removed and replaced as a respondent with that of the Cabinet Office.</p> <p>Whitehall sources said Cummings planned to fight the claim.</p> <p>Counsel for Khan, who is being backed by the FDA union, argued that Cummings was pivotal to the case and that what he had done personally, rather than just as an agent of the employer, was actionable. He is expected to be summoned as a witness.</p> <p>The hearing ruled that the Cabinet Office could be added as a respondent but Cummings would also remain.</p> <p>Khan, 28, was accused by Cummings of lying about her conversations with Hammond\u2019s former staff member Poppy Trowbridge.</p> <p>It is understood Khan was asked to hand over her work phone, and also presented her personal phone to Cummings.</p> <p>There were no other firsthand witnesses to Khan\u2019s sacking by Cummings, who spoke to her in an office in Downing Street close to the prime minister\u2019s.</p> <p>In a meeting days after Khan\u2019s departure with Boris Johnson\u2019s team of special advisers \u2013 known as spads \u2013 Cummings is said to have remarked: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like how I run things, there\u2019s the door.\u201d</p> <p>Bruce Carr QC, a former government adviser on employment law, said the naming of an individual as a respondent could mean he could be personally liable for damages.</p> <p>\u201cThere are plenty of cases where it is appropriate and legitimate to include an individual as a respondent where that individual is central to the allegations of discrimination,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhere that is or might be the case, it is actually very difficult for the principal respondent such as a government department to persuade a tribunal to strike out a claim against the individual named respondents.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you are effectively asking them to do is rule that the claim against the individual is frivolous or hopeless or is being brought for illegitimate reasons.\u201d</p> <p>Cummings has previously faced criticism over what some describe as his high-handed behaviour. In 2012, a senior civil servant received a payout of \u00a325,000 from the Department for Education in a bullying case she took against Cummings and a senior member of Michael Gove\u2019s team when Cummings was a special adviser at the department. An internal investigation found no grounds for disciplinary action.</p> <p>Cummings also drew criticism for hiring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/17/andrew-sabisky-boris-johnsons-ex-adviser-in-his-own-words\">Andrew Sabisky, a temporary contractor who resigned</a> over comments about eugenics and race.</p> <p>Johnson could also be asked to give evidence to the tribunal. At the time of Khan\u2019s dismissal last September, the terms of employment for special advisers made it clear that it was only the prime minister who had the power to sack them. This was then changed after Khan left, giving Cummings ultimate \u201cresponsibility for disciplinary matters\u201d.</p> <p>Dave Penman, the head of the FDA, declined to comment on the specifics of the case. \u201cThe FDA continues to support Sonia Khan through her legal claims at tribunal,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said:&nbsp;<strong>\u201c</strong>We don\u2019t&nbsp;comment&nbsp;on&nbsp;ongoing&nbsp;legal&nbsp;matters.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>A source added that it is standard government practice to ask for the employing department to be named as the respondent rather than individual employees.</p>",

However Stephen Isherwood, its chief executive, says the picture is \u201cmixed\u201d, with other employers still recruiting online.&nbsp;</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to predict how this will play out over the next five years, Isherwood says.&nbsp;Transport, travel and leisure industries could be heavily hit. Professional services such as law and accountancy could sit somewhere in the middle of the scale, while public sector graduate employers like Teach First or the police are likely to be resilient. The tech sector could continue to see growth.</p> <p>In this changing job market, students say they are anxious about the future: 81% are concerned about job prospects and 71% about their employability, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/education-52373828\">according to</a> the National Union of Students (NUS).</p> <p>Phoebe Davis, 23, who is studying a journalism master\u2019s at the University of Sheffield, fears she won\u2019t be financially independent for a long time. \u201cIt\u2019s scary more than anything. I\u2019m worried I\u2019m not going to get a job,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge chunk of students coming out of university with no idea what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Polly Hatcher, 23, studied history at the University of Leeds and is now considering a master\u2019s due to limited job opportunities. \u201cI feel a bit lost,\u201d she says. \u201cI had a plan and this has thrown a spanner in the works.\u201d Hatcher hopes further study will allow her&nbsp;to bide time, give her a niche, and make her a stronger candidate.</p> <p>Those who graduate into a decimated job market are often advised to go abroad or to continue education. With options for the former limited by the pandemic, experts are predicting an uptake in postgraduate courses over the next few years.</p> <p>A master\u2019s can give students more skills in a competitive job market. However, Isherwood warns not to look at further study as \u201cthe easy safe option\u201d, since not all postgraduate degrees improve employment prospects. </p> <p>Not everyone can afford this option, either. \u201cThe recession will compound disadvantages,\u201d Josh Hillman, director of education at the Nuffield Foundation, says. One way it could do this is through greater take up of postgraduate courses among wealthier students, he adds.</p> <p>Hillman believes universities now have a \u201csignificant responsibility\u201d to consider the employability of their graduates. In recent years, there has been growing recognition of the need to future-proof students\u2019 skills for a changing world of work, as automation was already expected to alter jobs over the coming decades. The pandemic may have made the focus on transferable skills even more necessary.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe often say our students are going into jobs that don\u2019t exist yet and in a way that\u2019s what employers will look for,\u201d says Natalie Brett, head of London College of Communication and pro vice-chancellor of the University of the Arts, London. </p> <p>Soft skills such as flexibility, resilience, communication, problem solving, and creativity were already becoming increasingly important and will likely become even more desirable, Brett says, while digital skills could be more in demand as organisations move services online.</p> <p>Rachel Hewitt, director of policy and advocacy at the Higher Education Policy Institute, says universities have faced growing demand from students to help them to develop such skills. \u201cThat\u2019s only going to build as we move forward in this difficult time,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Many careers services are currently providing services online. \u201cWe\u2019re busier than ever,\u201d says Claire Guy, a careers advisor at a Russell Group university and a member of the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services. \u201cWe\u2019ve always run workshops on developing a positive mindset, but there\u2019s a new flavour to that now. There\u2019s not just a need [for students] to be resilient about job rejections, but about the fact they might have to change their whole career plan.\u201d</p> <p>Hillman says he fears universities \u2013 which face a \u201cfinancial<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/06/coronavirus-uk-university-finances-student-numbers\"> black hole\u201d </a>estimated at over \u00a32.5bn \u2013 don\u2019t have the ability or expertise to give students the increased support they will need. \u201c[Universities] might have to do some rapid rethinking and partner with national organisations in the employment sector,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that might not be their top priority.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Universities UK is currently working with universities, careers services and employers on ways to provide additional support for recent graduates and current students, such as through enhanced careers services.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the NUS is urging the government to offer financial support for students graduating this year. \u201cGraduates and education leavers need a safety net: government intervention to support them by introducing a grant to be used towards further education, training, and other activity that will improve their job prospects,\u201d Claire Sosienski Smith, NUS vice-president for higher education, says.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/04/i-cant-get-motivated-the-students-struggling-with-online-learning\">'I can't get motivated': the students struggling with online learning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Support given now could help limit \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/06/risk-dole-queue-future-young-people-after-covid-19-crisis\">long-term scarring</a>\u201d caused by graduating into a recession. \u201c[Students graduating now] face a cliff edge,\u201d Hillman says. \u201cEvidence from previous recessions shows the effects of this can last at least up to a decade and possibly beyond that, with regards to earnings and job satisfaction.\u201d</p> <p>Becci Newton, deputy director of public policy research at the Institute of Employment Studies, says new graduates will need to keep moving in the early stage of their career and stay focused on their goals to avoid stagnating. \u201cThe ability to continuously learn and develop becomes the crucial key skill,\u201d she says.&nbsp;</p> <p>All of this may sound daunting to the class of 2020. For Marston, the pandemic has already made her reflect upon work. \u201cIt\u2019s put into perspective what jobs really matter,\u201d she says. \u201cI like the fact that with journalism you can contribute something and it\u2019s also a job you can do from home if you need to.\u201d However, despite her renewed sense of purpose, she still feels held back by the pandemic. \u201cThe uncertainty of not knowing what will happen next year is hard,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what to expect \u2013 but I\u2019m hoping for the best.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump was taken to the secure White House bunker, usually reserved for times of war or terrorist attacks, in the midst of noisy protests on Friday about the killing of George Floyd by police, and sporadic clashes close to the presidential complex\u2019s perimeter.</p> <p>According to several accounts by unnamed officials, Trump spent nearly an hour sequestered in the austere suite of hardened underground rooms designed for use in grave emergencies, and in which the then vice-president, Dick Cheney, took shelter during the 9/11 attacks.</p> <p>The decision to move the president to the bunker was attributed to US Secret Service officers tasked with protecting him. It was taken as chants from protesters in nearby Lafayette Park could be heard in the White House, and Secret Service and DC and park police were required to push back demonstrators from barriers close to the White House, some of whom were throwing stones and water bottles.</p> <p>The decision to take Trump to the bunker, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/politics/trump-protests-george-floyd.html\">first reported in the New York Times</a>, preceded the turning off of external lights at the White House during further protests on Sunday, and has inevitably reinforced the sense of a president under siege.</p> <p>Largely unheard from except for the stream of predictably accusatory and inflammatory tweets, Trump did, however, condemn Floyd\u2019s killing in a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-kennedy-space-center/\">speech marking the SpaceX launch in Florida</a> on Saturday.</p> <p>The White House and Secret Service remarked that they did not comment on security protocols and decisions or the means and methods of protective operations. The bunker is hardened to withstand the force of a passenger jet crashing into the White House.</p> <p>The incident provoked a stream of derisive comments on social media, comparing Trump unfavourably both to the presumptive Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, who visited protesters and to the cowardly lion from the Wizard of Oz. The hashtag \u201c#bunkerboy\u201d became a trending term on Twitter.</p> <p>Greg Sargent, who writes the Plum Line blog for the Washington Post, wrote: \u201cPresident of the United States cowering in fear of delivering a national address while instead issuing deranged tweets from his underground bunker somehow persuades himself that the world is laughing at someone else.\u201d</p> <p>The activist and author Amy Siskind was equally scathing. \u201cTrump hiding out in a bunker Friday, and shutting off the lights at the White House Sunday \u2013 both over a few hundred protesters \u2013 will be forever remembered as defining moments of his presidency when he was revealed as a coward, not the strongman he advertised.\u201d</p> <p>Colin Hanks, the actor son of Tom Hanks, described the incident as a metaphor for Trump\u2019s presidency.</p> <p>\u201cTrump is not leader. He KNOWS it in his bones. He is a coward. Turning off the lights, pretending no one is home while hiding in a bunker. There is no better metaphor for his, and his entire administration\u2019s failures. The election is in seven months. VOTE. HIM. OUT.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, who has tweeted encouraging the use of lethal force against \u201clooters\u201d, and warned protesters outside the White House of \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and \u201cominous weapons\u201d, has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service.</p> <p>By Monday Trump was calling for \u201claw and order\u201d and blaming far-left agitators for a sixth straight night of violent nationwide protests.</p> <p>After his visit to the space Launch in Florida on Saturday, Trump returned to a White House under virtual siege, with protesters, some violent, gathered just a few hundred yards away through much of the night. Demonstrators returned on Sunday afternoon, facing off against police at Lafayette Park into the evening.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/george-floyd-donald-trump-protests-violence-looting\">George Floyd: Donald Trump under fire as violence flares across America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe president and his family were rattled by their experience on Friday night, according to several advisers,\u201d the Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/politics/trump-protests-george-floyd.html\">report said</a>.</p> <p>Trump has been widely criticised for his response to the protests that have rocked the nation since video of Floyd\u2019s death began spreading on social media. <br><br>Despite days of peaceful protests and violent clashes with police in some of America\u2019s major cities, Trump has not addressed the nation and has repeatedly sent inflammatory messages over Twitter.</p> <p>Late on Friday, Trump tweeted that protesters could have been attacked with dogs and weapons wielded by the US Secret Service and accused the DC mayor for supposedly not providing police to protect the White House.</p> <p>\u201cThey let the \u2018protesters\u2019 scream and rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard \u2013 didn\u2019t know what hit them,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>\u201cIf they had [breached the fence],\u201d the president continued, \u201cthey would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.
