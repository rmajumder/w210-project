She instructed the Pierce county sheriff to review the actions taken by the officers on the scene.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/david-mcatee-louisville-protests-family\">\u2018I cannot stand it\u2019: family of Louisville man shot dead by police speak out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe officers who committed this crime should be fired and prosecuted to the full extent of the law,\u201d said Woodards in a late-night press conference on Thursday after the video was released.</p> <p>The video, captured by a woman whose name has not been released, appears to show two officers repeatedly punching a man lying on the ground. The woman can be heard screaming from her car: \u201cStop. Oh my God, stop hitting him. Just arrest him.\u201d</p> <p>The death of Ellis, a musician and father of two, has been ruled a homicide and is being investigated by the Pierce county sheriff\u2019s department. The county medical examiner\u2019s officer reported that he died due to hypoxia and physical restraint. Other factors that may have contributed to his death included methamphetamine intoxication and heart disease.</p> <p>The four officers involved were placed on administrative leave following the arrest. The Tacoma police department said in a statement that they returned to full duty once it was determined \u201cthere were no known departmental violations\u201d. Earlier this week they were placed again on administrative leave.</p> <p>On Friday, the Tacoma city council unanimously approved sending a letter to the governor, Jay Inslee, requesting an independent review of Ellis\u2019s death. The letter was in response to Ellis\u2019s family pushing for a thorough and independent investigation involving the state.<br><br>During the council meeting, Woodards also highlighted the need for the system to change, referencing the fact that she and the governor would look into establishing an independent review process for every officer-involved death in Washington.</p> <p>Ed Troyer, the Pierce county sheriff\u2019s spokesman, told the Guardian that the Tacoma police officers had noticed Ellis banging on car windows. When he came up to their car asking for help and saying there were warrants out for his arrest, an officer got out of the car.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ellis grabbed him by his vest and threw him to the ground, according to Troyer. The second officer then came out of the car and wrestled him into handcuffs. He was lying on the ground when he started saying he couldn\u2019t breathe. The officers turned him on to his side and called for medical units.</p> <p>The&nbsp;Washington senator Patty Murray said in a tweet on Thursday that her \u201cheart goes out to Manuel Ellis\u2019 family, those who loved him &amp; his community\u201d, and said she supported Inslee\u2019s push for an independent investigation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ellis was a father to an 18-month-old daughter and 11-year-old son, according to a GoFundMe account created five days ago by Monet Carter-Mixon, Ellis\u2019s sister, and Black Lives Matter Seattle King county. As of Friday, the page had raised over $46,000.</p> <p>\u201cWe are proud of the man Manuel became, like so many black men in our community, his greatest achievements were grounded in his ability to transform trauma and personal struggles into victories,\u201d the fundraiser says.</p>",
  "<p>Friday brought hope that the US economy is finally digging its way out of the rubble after Covid-19 wiped out millions of jobs \u2013 with no indication of when they would be coming back.

The monthly report comes from a survey administered in one week in the middle of the month (in May, it was administered 10-16 May). Meanwhile, the weekly reports come from states reporting the number of new unemployment claims they received that week.</p> <p>The headline figures from the latest monthly report indicate the risky game of reopening America means jobs are coming back but other measures in the report indicate the widespread economic devastation has not been relieved yet.</p> <p>Here are five key takeaways from the report that show it is a more sobering picture of the economy:</p> <h2>1. Racial disparities remain</h2> <p>While people may be celebrating that the national unemployment rate in May fell from 14.7% in April to 13.3%, the black unemployment has remained virtually unchanged. In April, the black unemployment rate was 16.7%, in May it was 16.8%.</p> <p>Meanwhile white Americans saw the largest decrease in unemployment of any racial group, going from 14.2% in April to 12.4% in May. Historically, the white unemployment rate is lower than the national unemployment rate, while black unemployment can be nearly twice as high.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hispanic Americans are still seeing the highest unemployment rate of any racial group, with a 17.6% unemployment rate in May, down from 18.9% in April.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hshierholz/status/1268900107170152448\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">These <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JobsDay?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JobsDay</a> numbers highlight the damage of the coronavirus ression\u2014a recession that has caused greater job loss in black households than white households and that will, as a result, exacerbate existing racial inequalities. 10/</p>&mdash; Heidi Shierholz (@hshierholz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hshierholz/status/1268900107170152448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 5, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>2. 19.6m jobs are still gone</h2> <p><br>While 2.5m jobs coming back is not insignificant, March and April saw 1.4m and 20.7m decreases in employment, respectively. That means that 19.6m have still not come back since shutdown orders were put in place in March.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/econjared/status/1268891456661598210\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here&#39;s a simple but important picture of what&#39;s happening to jobs. Extremely welcome reversal, of course, if it sticks, but the magnitude of the losses means that even if this uptick pace continues, it would take almost a year just to make up lost ground. <a href=\"https://t.co/kClNyb5kUz\">pic.twitter.com/kClNyb5kUz</a></p>&mdash; Jared Bernstein (@econjared) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/econjared/status/1268891456661598210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 5, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>3. Hospitality and leisure gained 1.2m jobs but still has a 35% jobless rate&nbsp;</h2> <p>Almost half of the employment gains in May were from the hospitality and leisure <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t18.htm\">industry</a>, which has been the industry hit hardest by shutdown orders. In May, the industry saw a 1.2m increase in jobs after it lost 7.5m jobs in April and 743,000 jobs in March.&nbsp;</p> <p>Other hard-hit industries saw increases in employment: construction added 464,000 jobs, education and health services 424,000 and retail recorded an increase of 368,000.&nbsp;</p> <p>But unemployment rates in those industries remain high. Leisure and hospitality had a 35.9% unemployment rate in May, nearly three times the overall national unemployment rate. Retail had the second-highest unemployment rate of any industry at 15.1%.&nbsp;</p> <h2>4. Millions more people gave up looking for work or had their hours cut&nbsp;</h2> <p>The official unemployment rate only counts people who indicated they are willing and able to work and are currently not working in any capacity. But millions more people whose jobs have been affected by the economic crisis are not represented in that rate.&nbsp;</p> <p>Many people are still working, but had their hours cut \u2013 perhaps because they were a server at a restaurant that is now just doing takeout or they work at a grocery store that reduced the hours it is open. These people want to be working a full, 40-hour work week, but cannot. More than 10 million people indicated they were working part-time because of economic conditions, either business conditions have worsened or they could only find part-time work.</p> <p>The U-6 is the unemployment rate that includes the total unemployed plus people who have given up looking for work or are working part-time but want full-time employment. The <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm\">U-6</a> in February was 7%, while in May it was 21.2%. This gives a more in-depth picture of how many workers have been affected by the pandemic.&nbsp;</p> <h2>5. The unemployment rate is probably higher than it appears&nbsp;</h2> <p>For the last few months, the Department of Labor has <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/cps/employment-situation-covid19-faq-may-2020.pdf\">admitted</a> that the official unemployment rate is probably higher because people are not filling out the survey correctly.&nbsp;</p> <p>The survey allows people to indicate they are employed but absent from work the week the survey was conducted and asks them to list the reason why, such as childcare, medical purposes, school or vacation. The survey instructs those who are employed but are not at work due to coronavirus to be marked as unemployed on temporary layoff.</p> <p>But the department noted that a higher-than-usual number of people indicated they were employed but not at work for \u201cother reasons\u201d and suspect that they are misclassified. While in other years during this time, about 500,000 said they were employed but out of work for \u201cother reasons\u201d, in May, that number climbed to 5.4 million.&nbsp;</p> <p>If those workers \u201chad been classified as unemployed on temporary layoff, the overall unemployment rate would have been about 3 percentage points higher than report\u201d, the Department of Labor said in May\u2019s report. The department said it was investigating how it could mitigate the misclassification in the future.</p>",
  "<p>On April 4 1968, Martin Luther King Jr phoned a local pastor with the title of his Sunday sermon: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.mintpressnews.com/mlks-children-reveal-undelivered-king-speech-america-may-go-hell/240264/\" title=\"\">Why America May Go to Hell</a>.\u201d The civil rights leader was shot dead before he could address the parishioners of Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta.

In November of that year, Richard Nixon won a law and order election by stoking the unspoken bigotry that the street violence had done so much to revive. Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/opinion/floyd-trump-nixon-coronavirus.html\" title=\"\">thinks he can do the same</a> with the nationwide protests over police brutality toward African Americans in the wake of the death of George Floyd. But history does not repeat itself, people do.</p> <p>There are signs that Americans have grown to be significantly better than their previous selves. The protests have drawn wide support from society. Mainly peaceful demonstrations have been a showcase for America\u2019s diversity. Mr Trump\u2019s polling numbers have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/politics/trump-campaign-virus-protests-polls.html\" title=\"\">plunged</a>. Surveys show that voters approve of the protests inspired by Floyd\u2019s death, and strongly disapprove of the president\u2019s response. There has been a sea change in <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-lots-of-white-democrats-ended-up-protesting-the-death-of-george-floyd/\" title=\"\">attitudes</a>, with Americans seeming to acknowledge that racism is a real problem for their society. The police officer who was seen suffocating Floyd with his knee has been charged with second-degree felony murder. Confederate statues and other relics to racism have come down in several states.</p> <p>There is also a long way to the 2020 presidential election. The demonstrations and violence may be a faraway memory by then. The political gaze may be fixed on a second coronavirus outbreak or the failing economy. The chaotic handling of the pandemic has left 100,000 dead and is evidence that Mr Trump is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/donald-trump-coronavirus-response-world-leaders\" title=\"\">not up to the job</a>.

The portents do not look good for a president running for re-election.</p> <p>The story of American politics since 1968 is dominated by a Republican party that gained a <a href=\"http://omarwasow.com/APSR_protests3_1.pdf\" title=\"\">political base</a> through Nixon\u2019s explicit appeals to whites who resented or were opposed to the civil rights movement.

Black people often live in the poorest areas and suffer the highest rates of unemployment. Relative to white people, black people receive longer sentences for the same crimes, are treated more disrespectfully by police in routine interactions, and are more likely to be shot by law enforcement. Blacks have long outnumbered whites in US prisons despite representing a fraction of the total population. So stacked is the deck against them that black boys \u2013 even rich black boys \u2013 can never assume <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white-and-black-men.html\" title=\"\">they can escape the poverty trap</a>.

And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again. Social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention.\u201d America must do more than listen to the unheard, it must hear them.</p>",

The restaurant is now open again for limited service, but Gonzalez has yet to be given any indication when she will get any work.</p> <p>She said she was unsure whether she could claim unemployment benefits, and was relying on her daughter and local charities. \u201cIt has been very difficult to make ends meet,\u201d she said. \u201cBills are unpaid. I feel humiliated and ignored.\u201d</p> <p>Gonzalez, 58, believes she has been passed over for younger workers, and sees few opportunities for herself in the current job market. \u201cSo many places are closed and thousands and thousands are unemployed,\u201d she said. She said her economic situation was \u201cthe worst I have ever faced\u201d.</p> <p>William Rodgers, the former chief economist at the US Department of Labor, has been watching the jobs report for 20 years. \u201cThe sheer volume, size and rapidity of losses is something I have never seen before,\u201d he said. He pointed out it took the US 16 months to reach a peak of 10% unemployment in the last recession.</p> <p>Rodgers is hopeful the job market can start recovering in the months ahead, but said he worries a lack of political action could lead to deeper losses. Much of the $1.6tn in federal aid signed off by Congress to staunch the wounds to the economy from Covid-19 has already been spent, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-many-u-s-workers-have-lost-jobs-during-coronavirus-pandemic-there-are-several-ways-to-count-11591176601?mod=hp_lead_pos5\">according to a Wall Street Journal analysis</a> of government data and estimates by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan nonprofit group.</p> <p>Rodgers is also concerned about further business closures following possible fresh outbreaks of coronavirus as states reopen and protests over the police killing of George Floyd sweep across the US.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The sheer volume, size and rapidity of losses is something I have never seen before</p> <footer> <cite>William Rodgers</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rodgers, a professor of public policy at Rutgers University, said his research shows the most significant statistical factor in which states have reopened fastest so far has been political rather than epidemiological. He has <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/black-unemployment-is-soaring-under-lockdown-protest-is-the-only-option-51591276960\">more sympathy</a> with the protesters. \u201cIt\u2019s another do-or-die choice. If you don\u2019t protest, you get more of what happened to Mr Floyd,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Another $3tn aid package proposed by Democrats is now being discussed in Congress but is meeting opposition from Republican senators.&nbsp;</p> <p>With no immediate sign of a vaccine, the length of the coronavirus recession and the rise in unemployment is hard to fathom. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated its impact could take a decade to unwind.</p> <p>In Florida, Jeanie Bailey is hoping it is sooner. Bailey filed for unemployment benefits in March after Glory Tours, her Tampa-based travel business was wiped out by the pandemic. Florida\u2019s unemployment system <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/florida-unemployment-system-coronavirus-applications\">all but collapsed</a> under the volume of applications and underfunding at the state level. It took 10 weeks for her to receive her first payment.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a total nightmare,\u201d said Bailey, who relied on family and savings to get by. Bailey, 50, sees no short-term solution to unemployment issues in tourist-dependent Florida.&nbsp;</p> <p>Many of her clients are elderly and she said few were currently in the holiday mood. \u201cPersonally I too feel a little leery about going out and doing too much,\u201d she said. \u201cRealistically it\u2019s going to take six months, maybe a year, to get back to normal.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Tim Davie, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/05/bbc-appoints-insider-tim-davie-as-director-general\">was announced on Friday as the BBC\u2019s new director general</a>, had a taste of the top role eight years ago, following the resignation of George Entwistle during the Jimmy Savile crisis.</p> <p>This stint, which lasted a matter of months until the arrival of Tony Hall, was brief but eventful. He dealt with the fallout from a Newsnight report that wrongly accused the Tory peer Lord McAlpine of child sex abuse.</p> <p>Davie, 53, is a keen runner who has completed the gruelling Marathon des Sables ultramarathon in Morocco,&nbsp;and has run an impressive time of just over three hours for the London marathon.</p> <p>He will need to be fleet of foot in his new role as the corporation faces challenges from all sides, including midterm licence fee negotiations with the government, the introduction of charges for millions of over-75s, and the retention of audiences being lured away by a new wave of streaming rivals.</p> <p>\u201cYes, he has been loyal, and he is very able and has a lot of drive,\u201d said one former BBC executive who used to work with Davie. \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t an inspired choice. I feel it would have been better for the BBC if the job had gone to someone from outside the corporation.\u201d</p> <p>For the last eight years Davie has been running BBC Studios. He is the corporation\u2019s highest-paid executive, making \u00a3642,000 last year \u2013 considerably more than Hall\u2019s \u00a3475,000. Davie has had to tighten his belt in taking the top role, agreeing to Hall\u2019s salary until mid-2021, when it will rise to \u00a3525,000, and he will have to bid farewell to the bonuses he has been accustomed to for most of his career.</p> <p>Davie moved to the commercial arm of the BBC in 2013, just after the corporation ended its disastrous and highly criticised ownership of the travel publisher Lonely Planet, selling it for an \u00a380m loss. In 2018 Davie, who recently stepped down as chairman of Comic Relief, was awarded a CBE for services to international trade.</p> <p>Before BBC Studios, Davie, who sits on the BBC board, had run the corporation\u2019s audio and music operation for four years, where he had responsibility for flagship stations Radio 1, 2, 3 and 4 as well as digital strategy. It was during this time that Davie led the plans to scrap 6 Music and the Asian Network, saying the corporation had too many stations and needed to invest in \u201cunique, high-quality radio\u201d. The BBC backed down on closing both stations after a huge public campaign. 6 Music has since gone from strength to strength, reporting record audience figures earlier this year.</p> <p>Davie spent his early career in marketing. His first role at the BBC, which he joined in 2005, was as director of marketing, communications and audiences, a role he took over from Andy Duncan, who would go on to run Channel 4. Upon joining, he immediately had to cut a significant number of the 480-strong marketing and PR department.</p> <p>He joined the BBC from Pepsi, where he was responsible for European marketing \u2013 including the decision to colour a Concorde and the Daily Mirror Pepsi blue for a campaign. It was during this time that Davie was also involved with another type of blue, holding the role of deputy chairman of the Hammersmith and Fulham Conservative party.</p> <p>Davie joined Pepsi in 1993 after cutting his teeth as a marketer at Procter &amp; Gamble, working on male toiletry brands. P&amp;G had spotted him early, hiring Davie while he was studying English at Cambridge \u2013 he was the first in his family to attend university \u2013 where he was president of his college union. He was privately educated at Whitgift school in South Croydon, which costs from \u00a320,000 a year for day students to \u00a340,000 for full boarding, which he attended after winning a scholarship. The school\u2019s motto is, rather aptly, <em>vincit qui patitur</em> (who perseveres, conquers). Sir David Attenborough lavished praise on the school when he visited in 2005 to to open a new part of its extensive grounds, which includes flamingos and peacocks.</p> <p>As well as turning down a shot as chief executive of the Premier League, Davie has been linked with the top jobs at ITV and Channel 4. Staying the course at the BBC has appeared to pay off.</p>",

But <strong>George Floyd</strong>\u2019s death has raised questions about whether Arradondo \u2014 or any chief \u2014 can fix the department. The city\u2019s own data going back to 2015 shows that when police officers use force, 60% of the time the person they\u2019re dealing with is black, though only 20% of the population is black.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI think the chief\u2019s heart is in the right place,\u201d <strong>City Council member Steve Fletcher</strong> said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think this department was ever going to let him get there. I think people understand he was in an impossible situation.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Fletcher argues that Arradondo was too lenient with discipline in his first year as chief as he worked to build department morale, which made getting rid of problem officers difficult later.</p> \n  <p>Arradondo\u2019s predecessor, <strong>Janee Harteau</strong>, was forced out over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/07/justine-damond-death-mohamed-noor-minneapolis\">the fatal shooting of <strong>Justine Ruszczyk Damond</strong></a>. She said she received push-back from the union when she was trying to implement reforms and this week she called on police union President Lt. <strong>Bob Kroll</strong> to resign after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/bob-kroll-george-floyd-minneapolis-police-union-chief\">his controversial comments</a>.</p> \n  <p>The Minnesota Department of Human Rights filed civil rights charges related to Floyd\u2019s death and will investigate the Minneapolis Police Department to determine if it has engaged in discriminatory practices, <strong>Governor Tim Walz</strong> said this week.</p> \n  <p>Fletcher said he wants to examine whether the police department should be disbanded, saying he believes it\u2019s \u201cso broken it can\u2019t be fixed.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI think we need to rebuild from the ground up,\u201d said Fletcher, vice chair of the city\u2019s public safety committee. <br></p> \n  <p>Bob Bennett, an attorney who said he has sued the department \u201chundreds\u201d of times over police misconduct allegations, said Arradondo probably did the best he could, but the union has more sway than chiefs do over police conduct.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI know he wants to reform the department as much as anyone I\u2019ve ever met or seen,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cHopefully this whole mess will bring about some change.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed9e4e68f0854eb54d99384\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-05T06:35:07.864Z\">7.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Today so far\u2026</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>\u201cWhat happened to Floyd happens every day in this country in education and health services and in every area of American life.

Bail would be lowered to $750,000 if they agreed to certain conditions, including forfeiting any personal firearms</p> \n  <p>Derek Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd\u2019s death, which happened on Memorial Day, 25 May. Witness video shows Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck during an arrest, for almost nine minutes. Floyd pleads he cannot breathe, then stops moving.<br></p> \n  <p>Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-killing-derek-chauvin-charge-elevated-three-other-officers-charged\">announced the charges</a> against Thao, Lane and Kueng on Wednesday, also increasing the charge against Chauvin.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s the Associated Press:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Defense attorneys argued for lower bail. They told the court Chauvin was the training officer for Lane and Kueng, who had been on the job just four and three days respectively. Defendants don\u2019t normally enter pleas during their first appearances in Minnesota courts, which tend to be brief proceedings. Judge Paul Scoggin set their next court dates for 29 June.</p> \n   <p>If convicted, Chauvin faces a maximum of 40 years in prison on the murder count and 10 years for manslaughter. Under Minnesota law, aiding and abetting second-degree murder is tantamount a second-degree murder charge, so <strong>Thao, Lane and Kueng face the same potential penalties</strong> if convicted. A date for Chauvin\u2019s first court appearance has not been set.</p> \n   <p>The complaint against Lane, 37, notes that he asked about rolling Floyd on his side and wondered about delirium, but went on to say that Lane \u201ctook no actions to assist Mr Floyd, to change his position, or to reduce the force the officers were using against Mr Floyd.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The complaint against Kueng, 26, says he was positioned between Chauvin and Lane and could hear their comments. The complaint against Thao, 34, who was seen in the cellphone video standing near a crowd of bystanders, says the officer initially got a hobble restraint from the squad car, \u201cbut the officers decided not to use it and maintained their positions.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Governor Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights ordered a civil rights investigation of the police department to determine how to address its history of racial discrimination and find solutions for systemic change.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T20:10:07.371Z\">at 9.10pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed934288f0854eb54d98f62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T19:21:34.521Z\">8.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As Nick Confessore of the New York Times put it on Twitter today, \u201cTrump began his term promising to build a wall to protect America from the world.

Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He also compared Trump\u2019s behaviour to Nazi propaganda and called the president\u2019s stunt on Monday, ordering the gassing of peaceful protesters so he could stage a photo op outside St John\u2019s church, an \u201c<strong>abuse of executive authority</strong>\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1268347256748507136\">tweeted</a> back: \u201cProbably the only thing Barack Obama &amp; I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world\u2019s most overrated General.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Almost as inevitable as the abuse was the fact that the tweet contained a lie.

He did not ask for his resignation. <strong>The president has clearly forgotten how it actually happened or is confused</strong>. The president tweeted a very positive tweet about Jim until he started to see on Fox News their interpretation of his letter. Then he got nasty. Jim Mattis is a honorable man.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Unlike Mattis, Kelly has spoken out about Trump before, backing impeachment witness Lt Col Alexander Vindman and expressing quite wide disagreement. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/13/ex-white-house-chief-staff-john-kelly-speaks-out-against-trump\">Asked in February</a> why he went to work for Trump in 2017, Kelly said he had been \u201cfascinated \u2013 not necessarily in a good way \u2013 but fascinated as to what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">that election</a> meant to our country\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Kelly and Mattis have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/19/john-kelly-donald-trump-cliff-sims-book\">widely reported</a> to have been \u201cadults in the room\u201d in the first years of the Trump White House, willing to stand up to the president and obstruct his more dangerous impulses.

  "<p>Each evening since a white Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd during an arrest, emotional protests have erupted in downtown Detroit. Thousands of protesters march nightly through the city\u2019s streets demanding justice for Floyd and an end to police brutality, especially against African Americans.</p> <p>The protesters are generally backed by Detroit residents. They and their supporters see the police as aggressors; officers have fired teargas, flash grenades and rubber bullets, sometimes at protesters who are peaceful but breaking curfew. Activists say the marches are the only appropriate response to a grave injustice.&nbsp;</p> <p>But about 17 miles north-east of downtown Detroit, in the largely white, middle-class suburb of St Clair Shores, some see a totally different reality playing out. Residents here who spoke to the Guardian said the police were acting with restraint and protesters were aggressors who are provoking violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>While Detroit\u2019s population is more than 80% black, St Clair Shores, which sits just a few miles from the city\u2019s northern border, is 93% white \u2013 a common racial disparity in a highly segregated region. Most of Detroit\u2019s white residents left the city for suburbs like St Clair Shores in the decade following the city\u2019s 1967 protests over racial inequality. The violent \u201crebellion\u201d raged for days as hundreds of buildings were burned and 16 died.&nbsp;</p> <p>These are the people whom Donald Trump is seeking to appeal to with his bid to be a \u201claw and order\u201d president as he seeks re-election. He hopes to mobilize a largely white voter base that has historically shunned integration and sought to preserve its privileges in the face of political and economic advancement by minorities.</p> <p>Many in St Clair Shores share the president\u2019s world view that the police and national guard are heroically battling violent agitators, not brutally suppressing largely peaceful protesters.&nbsp;</p> <p>Several men who were part of a construction crew called the protests \u201cstupid\u201d and a \u201cwaste of time and energy\u201d. Some even suggested Floyd was at fault for his death because he allegedly committed a crime, despite general worldwide outrage at the brutal manner of his killing and the criminal charges it has now brought against the officers involved.&nbsp;</p> <p>Others, like Gloria Kinne, a St Clair Shores business owner, acknowledged that racial discrimination exists \u201cin isolated spots\u201d and said she supported the right to peaceful protest, but she added that she was troubled by images of protesters clashing with police and vandalizing property.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry to see the violence come into it,\u201d Kinne said. \u201cThe people who are harmed are the small businesses and people who have nothing to do with it and no control over it. It\u2019s been bad enough with Covid-19, but now they have their stores vandalized on top of that.\u201d</p> <p>Jim Angel, a St Clair Shores retiree, suggested it was African Americans who were always behind police protests, though he ignored the long and unique history of black people in America, a land where they were once enslaved.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThis hasn\u2019t had anything to do with the Irish, Polish and Germans \u2013&nbsp;why is it only one ethnic group that needs change?\u201d he asked.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cadae1948acd36ea17c50e7df4d0c5bd7019188\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cadae1948acd36ea17c50e7df4d0c5bd7019188/0_30_5063_3039/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Clair Shores, Michigan, amid the coronavirus lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St Clair Shores, Michigan, amid the coronavirus lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Politically, St Clair Shores is considered a swing district in the vital 2020 battleground state of Michigan, though it has leaned conservative in recent elections. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by between 10 and 20 points in each of the city\u2019s precincts in 2016.&nbsp;</p> <p>The reviews of Trump\u2019s handling of the protests have been mixed. Kinne said with a laugh, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear my answer to that,\u201d when asked about the president\u2019s response. But local resident Ted Miller said he \u201capplauds\u201d the president\u2019s harsh measures and inflammatory rhetoric. He also \u201cfully supports\u201d any decision to call in the military.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThese are the kind of things that he\u2019s best at. He\u2019s the law and order president,\u201d Miller said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Angel told the Guardian he didn\u2019t think the military was needed yet, and also praised the police for remaining \u201cvery, very calm\u201d in the face of provocation.</p> <p>Kinne echoed that, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s important that they measure their response based on the temper of the protest.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIf the protest is peaceful then the police need to be \u2013 and they have been \u2013 very calm,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the other hand, if the protest becomes violent, then they have the right to protect themselves, too.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Kinne added that she disagreed with claims that racism and police brutality are systemic within law enforcement, despite the fact minority groups, and especially African Americans, suffer disproportionately at the hands of the justice system and the police.</p> <p>Kinne did not believe it was fair to blame \u201call police in every state in every city for what certain individuals do\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority of police officers and first responders are out there doing good,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a few bad actors among shopkeepers, among steelworkers and among any group of people you\u2019re going to find an element that can be violent and be racist, and it\u2019s a terrible thing, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say, \u2018All police are violent.\u2019\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Though the protests are an emotional controversy, Miller said the country was \u201cfull of controversies\u201d and he didn\u2019t think this would influence the November election.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cPeople already have their minds made up how they\u2019re going to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just one more thing for everyone to disagree about and fight about.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 June 2020 because an earlier version referred to Detroit\u2019s 1967 protests as having happened in 1968.

  "<p>I spent last weekend thinking about what makes me different from Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. I was trying to convince myself that \u201cI\u2019ll be OK\u201d \u2013 that under similar circumstances, I would experience a different outcome. How much larger of a smile do I need to stretch across my face when I walk through whiter neighborhoods? How much more polite can I be to a police officer who only sees the darkness of my skin? These are the questions that have wrestled control of my mind.</p> <p>I spent the weekend asking myself what I can do to avoid becoming another name flashing across the news ticker as the latest black person killed for essentially just trying to live.

I envy how my white friends get to opt into cultural and racial sainthood by sending the now-customary text. I appreciate every text, but wish that I could be the one to send the text \u2013 opting into tragedy for a moment to mourn and pay respects, then opting right back out. But I can\u2019t. I have to continuously process these tragedies \u2013 dissecting why this one or that one <em>couldn\u2019t </em>be me, why my outcome would be different. I don\u2019t come up with anything.&nbsp;</p> <p>This weekend marked the 99th anniversary of a race massacre which destroyed a thriving \u201cblack Wall Street\u201d in Tulsa, Oklahoma, my home town. Not far from Tulsa is Red Bird, a small historically all-black town my mom would visit as a home health nurse. I thought about an investment company in Red Bird owned and run by black families in the early 1900s that advertised on brochures: \u201cA Message to the Colored man. Do you want a home in the Great Southwest \u2013&nbsp;the Beautiful Indian Territory? In a town populated by intelligent, self-reliant colored people?\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Momentarily, I gained some comfort from that sentiment. But as soon as the past-inspired hope began to swell, I came back to the current moment where black people in that part of Tulsa, once teeming with opportunity for black life, are just dealing with what it feels like to just survive \u2013 a baby born today in one of the most predominantly black zip codes in Tulsa can expect life to be 10.7 years shorter than their white counterparts. They\u2019re not living either, they\u2019re barely surviving.&nbsp;</p> <p>Unlike the brave black journalists of the late 1800s and early 1900s who fondly wrote of a black promised land in present-day Oklahoma where black families could retreat, I have no place to offer my people where we can, as they wrote, \u201cCome out of the wilderness from among these lawless lynchers and breathe the free air.\u201d I cannot in accordance with good journalistic ethics or even in service of the truth, write fondly of a place where Minneapolis residents can escape to live abundantly. I can only tell you how we might survive in it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Surviving means questioning every day \u2013 but especially days like the ones over the past few weeks \u2013 whether I want to bring black children into this world only to contend with the same world whose arc seems to not bend toward justice. Surviving means possibly having those children one day only to have \u201cthe talk\u201d with them. Except this talk won\u2019t be just about what happens when they get pulled over. No, this talk will include warnings of what could happen to them if, among other things, they jog, they play with a replica Airsoft gun, they sleep at night in their homes, they grab their wallets, they get a traffic ticket.</p> <p>We may no longer be valued as 3/5 of a person the way enslaved blacks were, but the events of these past weeks remind black people that we\u2019re not valuable enough to live abundantly. We can only hope to get by \u2013 to survive.</p> <p>There is no escape to a promised land. There\u2019s only clearly yelling at America that no matter how much she may ignore us or tell us that our protest is neither civil nor peaceful, our lives, separate and apart from anyone else\u2019s, matter and we want to <em>live</em> here.</p>",
  "<p>Scores of protesters and police are set to converge on central Sydney on Saturday despite the New South Wales supreme court ruling a rally drawing attention to police treatment of Indigenous Australians is illegal and should not go ahead.</p> <p>After NSW police asked the court to call off the Black Lives Matter protest, scheduled to meet at Town Hall in Sydney on Saturday, Justice Desmond Fagan ruled there would be a public safety risk in allowing the protest \u2013 which expects 5,000 attendees \u2013 to go ahead during the Covid-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Relying in part on an affidavit from the NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant, Fagan ultimately decided that giving the green light for the protest to proceed would be in \u201cdefiance\u201d of the decisions made by ministers and the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee to stop the spread of Covid-19.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lawyers representing the protest organisers argued protesters would attend the planned rally regardless of the legal outcome, and because of this, it should be given legal support so police could close roads to allow for attendees to socially distance, rather than forcing them onto footpaths where distancing was harder to observe.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/jun/05/australias-shameful-record-on-black-deaths-in-custody\">Australia\u2019s shameful record on black deaths in custody</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, Fagan did not accept this argument, labelling it \u201cfutile\u201d to assume Australians would not obey the court\u2019s decision.

Whimn, or \u201cwith her in mind\u201d, aimed to take on Mamamia and be \u201cthe number one female news and information source in this country\u201d when it launched in 2016.

For the fourth month in a row ABC News is No 1 in the <a href=\"https://mumbrella.com.au/news-com-au-tumbles-to-sixth-in-ranking-of-australias-most-popular-websites-as-abc-maintains-lead-630211\">Nielsen digital content ratings</a> and news.com.au has surprisingly plummeted from No 2 to No 6, after spending most of 2019 at No 1.</p> <p>Which brings us to the Australian and its gold medal performance in the spin category this week.

In March, which saw a huge spike in news across the board, the Oz managed to enter the top 10 digital news sites for the first time since 2018 but in April it dropped out again. With the Oz a no-show there is now only one News Corp masthead \u2013 news.com.au \u2013 in the top 10 news brands in the country.</p> <h2><strong>Saturation coverage</strong></h2> <p>The Nielsen&nbsp;data for news sites showed a big drop across all publishers in April as interest in the coronavirus waned after a big spike in interest in March.</p> <p>The protests in the US and the return of live sport has seen coverage of coronavirus drop below 50% of all news articles for the first time in nearly three months, according to data from Streem&nbsp;media monitoring. The Covid-19 media saturation peaked on 24 March when the virus was mentioned in 81% of stories published &nbsp;that day. In January there was a peak of 36% for the bushfire coverage.</p> <p>Last Friday the coronavirus content fell below 50% for the first time since 13 March.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Boxing clever</strong></h2> <p>All credit to the Australian\u2019s photographer Nic Walker for giving us this image of 60-year-old box manufacturer Anthony Pratt.
