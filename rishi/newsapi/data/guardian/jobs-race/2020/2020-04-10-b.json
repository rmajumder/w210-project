  "<p>Tommy Chong has got the munchies. It\u2019s early afternoon in locked-down LA, and last night he was on the pot cookies. \u201cMy wife, Shelby, just made a whole batch of them \u2013 oatmeal and maple syrup.\u201d He stops to correct himself. \u201cI put the pot in there, and of course I put too much in. Last night it got me almost comatose. Shelby got kinda mad at me. You know like when a kid gets so stoned all you do is sit there and grin.\u201d Chong is 82 next month.</p> <p>He sounds about four decades younger \u2013 his voice is deep, sexy, pulsing with life. Chong is one half of the most famous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/25/back-with-a-bong-why-we-need-stoner-movies-more-than-ever\">stoner comic partnership in history, Cheech and Chong</a>. In the 1970s, they not only sold out their live shows, they topped the album charts and had huge box-office hits with movies such as Up in Smoke and Cheech and Chong\u2019s Next Movie. The double-act were as radical as they were bonkers. And while the films were ostensibly about two aspiring rock stars in search of the next spliff, they introduced audiences to a downtown, multiracial Los Angeles rarely seen in movies.</p> <p>Their characters, Pedro de Pacas (Richard \u201cCheech\u201d Marin ) and Anthony \u201cMan\u201d Stoner (Chong), were hopeless wasters, but heroically so. In their frequent spats with the police, they invariably won \u2013 even if they didn\u2019t have a clue how or indeed even notice that they had.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46fee27a6c2b501f9f4a0e5bf4a78dfcbbf543c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46fee27a6c2b501f9f4a0e5bf4a78dfcbbf543c5/0_0_3600_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tommy Chong, left, and Cheech Marin in Cheech and Chong in Concert, 1973.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feel the vibe ...

After they split up he enjoyed success as a solo comic and businessman (though that ended up in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/20/film.usa\">jail sentence</a>). Before Cheech and Chong, he was a guitarist with Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers, co-writing their hit single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsFuZ4Lap4Q\">Does Your Mama Know About Me</a> \u2013 a gorgeous song about a mixed-race relationship. Although they only had the one hit, the band were influential \u2013 something Chong is again quick to point out. A young Jimi Hendrix played with them, and they were partly responsible for the Jackson Five (who opened for them in 1968) signing to Motown. Or rather Chong was.</p> <p>\u201cI was the lawyer who signed the contract for them,\u201d he says. Hold on, I say, you\u2019re not a lawyer. Chong laughs. \u201cWell, I was the whitest guy they knew. I looked like a Jewish guy, a lawyer. So literally Bobby Taylor took the contract and gave it to me and said what d\u2019you think?\u201d Chong gave it the OK and the rest is history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"48b7aec2e1f97ba99e4ce675ea58a2a2090d570d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48b7aec2e1f97ba99e4ce675ea58a2a2090d570d/0_0_3504_2123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roll up, roll up ...

And now we have landed at British royalty. \u201cI played <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsFuZ4Lap4Q\">Does Your Mama Know</a> for Prince Harry. We were in the Spencers\u2019 house. We went there for a wedding two years ago.\u201d Did he get high with Harry? \u201cHe was busy with the wedding,\u201d Chong says, discreetly. \u201cHe took a liking to Shelby because she had read all about him and knew his life story.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>England is probably the most racist country in the world with its royalty and its caste system</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He may have a lot of time for Harry and Meghan, but not for the royal family as a whole. \u201cEngland itself is probably the most racist country in the world with its royalty and its caste system.\u201d Chong does not like to hold back. \u201cYou still have the system that colonised the world. Meghan wasn\u2019t white enough. She would never be white enough. I can see why they left. Megan could never be accepted into the royal family. She knew that and the whole family did. The whole English system is set up that way.\u201d</p> <p>From the royals he turns to Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t know Trump personally, but he says he remembers coming across his type as a young man in British Columbia. \u201cI knew people like Trump all my life in Canada \u2013 we called them gangsters. And they hung around the Stock Exchange in Vancouver. That\u2019s where his grandpa made all his money. Running whores, and gambling joints and bootlegging.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ef6988271b6f9bc48bf0362fd729e7ffa36c68b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ef6988271b6f9bc48bf0362fd729e7ffa36c68b/0_0_3182_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bobby Taylor and The Vancouvers ...clockwise from top, Bobby Taylor, Wes Henderson and Tommy Chong in about 1968.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"754\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bobby Taylor and The Vancouvers ...clockwise from top, Bobby Taylor, Wes Henderson and Tommy Chong in about 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chong is convinced that once he leaves office, Trump will face criminal charges. \u201cHe is a Russian asset. History will show that. He\u2019s been colluding with Russia from the get-go \u2013 the Mueller report even said it. The only reason they couldn\u2019t do anything is because he\u2019s the president, and the minute Trump\u2019s not president they\u2019re gonna put his ass in jail.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a big claim. Do you really think Trump will end up jailed? \u201cYes. If Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby are an example, yes, I think he will. So he\u2019s going to go. He\u2019s insulted too many people.\u201d When you go after judges, he says, it comes back to bite you in the ass.</p> <p>One of the things he finds most offensive about Trump is his attitude to people of colour. \u201cJust because you were born with money don\u2019t make you any better than anybody else on the planet, but he\u2019s still sticking to that thing that because he\u2019s white and privileged he somehow is better than other people.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I knew people like Trump all my life in Canada \u2013\u00a0we called them gangsters</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Race, and racism, has been at the heart of Chong\u2019s life and his humour. He grew up in Calgary, a conservative Canadian city, the son of a Chinese father and a Canadian mother with Celtic roots. He still sounds shocked by the attitudes he experienced there as a child. \u201cYou know, they would sell brazil nuts in the grocery store and they\u2019d call them nigger toes. And they had little <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/may/25/consider-liquorice\">black liquorice beans</a> called nigger babies. \u2018Can I have five cents worth of nigger babies?\u2019 Again he laughs \u2013 this time appalled. \u201cThat\u2019s where I grew up.\u201d<br><br>As a young boy he remembers his whole class apart from him being invited to a birthday party. \u201cI just looked out of the window of the second storey and could see my friends gathering around the fire. I was uninvited \u2019cos the girl\u2019s father was worried she might end up with a coloured guy or Chinese guy.\u201d</p> <p>By then, he was already used to being isolated. When he was a baby, his mother contracted TB and he developed pleurisy. \u201cMy first memories are hospital and my mom was quarantined in a sanitarium. I never saw her for the first three or four years of my life. So I feel I\u2019ve been through this pandemic before with my mother.\u201d</p> <p>How is he coping? He says he is missing his five children and the grandchildren. \u201cIt affects everybody\u2019s life. We can\u2019t do our family reunions. It\u2019s lonely. Even though you\u2019ve got your kids a phone call away, you still want to hold them and hug them and be part of their life.\u201d But, he stresses, he\u2019s lucky \u2013 he\u2019s got Shelby\u2019s company, her gourmet cooking and the pot cookies.<br><br>It was in the late 60s that he teamed up with Richard Marin, a Mexican-American whose nickname was Cheech. They played music and did comedy sketches in a Vancouver strip club. The funny stuff soon took over, and the strip club became a comedy club.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"df09c878567d4aac311df06c4640a275404cac55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df09c878567d4aac311df06c4640a275404cac55/711_304_4993_2995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marin and Chong pose, in 2018, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Up in Smoke.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marin and Chong pose, in 2018, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Up in Smoke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Eshel/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cheech and Chong prided themselves on taking things to extremes \u2013 spliffs the size of tubas (famously smoking labarador poo in their first film, Up in Smoke), idiocy off the IQ ratings and staggeringly incorrect sexual politics (in Cheech and Chong\u2019s Next Movie, Cheech only desists from having sex with a woman who seems to have died on him because she wakes up).</p> <p>He says his favourite Cheech and Chong sketch is Hey, Margaret \u2013 about a husband describing a porn film to his wife. First, an elderly woman has sex with the pizza delivery man, then she has sex with a dog, and the husband reports it all back to Margaret with relish. Finally, she has sex with a \u201cgod-damned coloured guy\u201d and the husband turns away sickened. It was bad-taste comedy with bigotry as the butt of the joke.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GwxVGUJRzE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7GwxVGUJRzE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Why does he think they were so popular? Simple, he says. \u201cWe communicated with people. They would get high to come and see us and then we\u2019d act crazy and make them laugh.\u201d</p> <p>Could they really be such dedicated stoners and still be so prolific, or was it an act? Chong sounds slightly offended by the question. \u201cOh no, for the most part we were always high. We always smoked a little before we went out there. That was part of the job.\u201d</p> <p>Drugs, he says, were essential to the creative process. \u201cIt was my job as a writer and performer to deliver the goods. So if that meant being stoned, I gladly did it. I found that the more stoned I was, the more crazy the movie was, and the more successful we were.\u201d What was his drug of choice when writing? Oh, he says, there were a few. \u201cA little bit of cocaine and the acid and then the weed.\u201d</p> <p>Cheech and Chong appeared to be having the time of their lives. But by the mid-80s they had fallen out. \u201cWe had some pretty heated arguments. Cheech would go on vacation and I\u2019d be left alone to write the movies. Then he\u2019d come back and I\u2019d direct them, and he got tired of it. He was thinking I got too much credit.\u201d Did he have a point? \u201c Well, I maintain that if he\u2019d listened to me it would have been better all the way around.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The only way people listen to you is if you\u2019re the director. If you\u2019re not the director, people don\u2019t give a shit what you\u2019ve got to say</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In his memoir, Marin called Chong \u201cthe world\u2019s humblest megalomaniac\u201d. Talking to Chong today, I get a sense of what he means. Alongside the hippy-dippy mellowness, there is a man who clearly likes doing things his way. \u201cThe only way people listen to you is if you\u2019re the director. If you\u2019re not the director, people don\u2019t give a shit what you\u2019ve got to say.\u201d So it was a power struggle between him and Marin? \u201cWell, yeah, for sure. Because what Cheech wanted was the part where you got the power.\u201d</p> <p>Chong calls Marin a genius \u2013 not just for his comedic skills, but for his photographic memory and the sharpness of his brain. As for himself, he says his great gift has always been for teaming up with the right person \u2013 whether it be Marin or Shelby, his second wife, to whom he has been married for 45 years.</p> <p>At times, he sounds calculated when he talks about what Marin brought to the table. \u201cWe clicked from the off. And I soon realised I\u2019ve got a goldmine with this guy because LA is made up mostly of Mexicans. So I realised, oh man, we can own this place with comedy. And we do. I mean our comedy\u2019s lasted longer than anything.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, he says, it was money that did for them. \u201cI always say we broke up \u2019cos we got rich. My joke is you can\u2019t make a rich Mexican do shit! Hehehe! That still makes me laugh.\u201d Did wealth change them? \u201cYea. You make the wrong decision. You\u2019d rather do your summer house than go on the road again.\u201d Chong says if you\u2019re in the entertainment business and you\u2019re not 100% dedicated to entertaining, you might as well give up. And they did.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b6c90bbf10dd9839c67e6d30b096be0053177bfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6c90bbf10dd9839c67e6d30b096be0053177bfc/0_0_3000_1646/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tommy and Shelby Chong and Cheech Marin perform at the Cheech &amp; Chong show in New Jersey in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"549\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tommy and Shelby Chong and Cheech Marin perform at the Cheech &amp; Chong show in New Jersey in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bobby Bank/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the split, Chong developed his solo standup. But he hated being away from Shelby. \u201cI couldn\u2019t leave my wife at home. She\u2019s too beautiful to leave alone.\u201d (He tells me three times how beautiful she is and how much he loves her.) So Shelby learned how to do standup and went on the road with him. Occasionally, in his live act he would phone Cheech, but Cheech refused to play along. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be funny, so I quit phoning him.\u201d And they fell out some more.</p> <p>In 2003, at the age of 65, Chong was jailed for nine months for selling glass pipes on the internet that could be used for smoking cannabis (though they were produced as collectible works of art): each bong had his name and a picture of his face on it. It was a family business, and Chong agreed to plead guilty in exchange for the non-prosecution of Shelby and his son Paris.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c777c301989bd86d39ebffbfbd590194bc8c9c37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c777c301989bd86d39ebffbfbd590194bc8c9c37/0_0_2000_1230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chong leaves the federal court in Pittsburgh in 2003 after pleading guilty to conspiring to sell drug paraphernalia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"615\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chong leaves the federal court in Pittsburgh in 2003 after pleading guilty to conspiring to sell drug paraphernalia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keith Srakocic/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He says jail changed him, physically and spiritually.

His hair and beard turned white, and he emerged from incarceration looking rather professorial. Since then he has seen off two cancers, and returned to the road.</p> <p>Despite the rise of rightwing populists, impending environmental catastrophe and the Covid-19 pandemic, he says life has never been better.\u201cI see today as the best time to be alive because we weren\u2019t content with what we had. We were always looking for that better club, the better audience to play in front of.\u201d</p> <p>In his 80s, he has never been more occupied \u2013 gigging with Shelby, launching his own brand of marijuana (<a href=\"https://tommychong.com/\">Chong\u2019s Choice</a>) in 2016 when the drug was legalised for recreational use in California, and spending time with his kids. He even made up with Cheech, thanks to Paris. A decade ago his son found an email from Marin on Chong\u2019s computer asking if he wanted to try to put aside differences \u2013 Paris didn\u2019t bother to tell his dad, wrote yes and hit reply.</p> <p>Since then Cheech and Chong have been gigging again, with Shelby as their opening act. On the day we speak, he is supposed to be promoting a Cheech and Chong video game, but he is too excited about new opportunities to mention it. Doe he think the duo might make another film? Silence. But I can sense his boyish excitement at the other end of the line. \u201cWell I can\u2019t really tell you that now,\u201d he says coyly. So there might be one? \u201cI\u2019ve got to wait till it\u2019s a reality as opposed to telling you dreams. I\u2019ll turn it into a reality and then I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p> <p>And with that he\u2019s off to satisfy those munchies and realise his dreams.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LDRLY.cheechandchong&amp;fbclid=IwAR2xj-ydYBefXm3qRn6tpBvJ0JYhS2qnk4lZ8I0GbJXiTdjvngUo8NVkAA8\">The Cheech &amp; Chong Bud Farm video game</a> is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cheech-and-chong-bud-farm/id1498492128?fbclid=IwAR3fwQskLbdqsiRSmoMLw40rlhyXd0zv5Fb4lAAEddpoFq6Aj-Z36pH93F4\">available for download on 20 April</a></p>",
