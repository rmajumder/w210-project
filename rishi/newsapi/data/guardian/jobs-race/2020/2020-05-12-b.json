With the country largely confined to staying at home during the health emergency, shoppers also rushed to buy games consoles, bicycles, sewing and knitting goods and office equipment for working at home.</p> <p>Dickinson said the coronavirus outbreak had accelerated the trend for shoppers to increasingly purchase goods and services online. \u201cIt is likely that as the lockdown wears on, these new shopping habits will become more entrenched for many consumers.\u201d</p> <p>Separate figures from Barclaycard, which handles almost half of all credit and debit card transactions as Britain\u2019s biggest credit card provider, indicated sales collapsed by 36.5% in April compared with a year earlier.</p> <p>The figures also revealed a dramatic upturn in shopping for food at supermarkets as more Britons prepared meals at home, with sales climbing by 14.3%.</p> <p>In a potential sign of lengthy queues at big retail outlets and difficulty getting slots for online delivery, the figures also showed specialist food and drink stores \u2013 including off licences, greengrocers and independent convenience stores \u2013 recorded an almost 40% rise in sales, as shoppers continued to support local businesses. Online spending on home improvement and DIY also increased by a quarter.</p> <p>According to a survey of 2,000 adults conducted for Barclaycard, almost nine in 10 said they had saved money on everyday expenses since lockdown began. However, confidence over job security dropped sharply to 42%.</p> <p>Esme Harwood, director at Barclaycard, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough time for retailers as consumer spending has dropped considerably under lockdown. There are some bright spots, though, as Brits have turned their focus online and looked to takeaways, digital subscriptions and DIY to keep entertained and occupied.</p> <p>\u201cA renewed sense of community may be welcome news for independent businesses, with a growing desire to support local stores in life after lockdown.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Fifteen years ago, when broadcaster Alan Jones was at the height of his career, media academic Graeme Turner headed up a three-year study of talkback radio. It involved listening to a month of Alan Jones\u2019s broadcasts.</p> <p>It concluded that talkback radio \u2013 then in its heyday \u2013 could be democratising, giving neglected people voice and direct access to decision-makers. It could help to construct communities and provide current affairs radio of mass appeal.</p> <p>But Alan Jones was something else again.</p> <p>Turner concluded that in some ways Jones wasn\u2019t a talk<em>back </em>host at all, because he talked too much. He spoke more than any of his competing radio hosts \u2013 taking up 75% of the time he was on air.</p> <p>Even when he took a call from an audience member, Jones would be talking for more than 56% of the call.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/16/malcolm-turnbull-news-corp-is-like-a-political-party-with-the-murdochs-encouraging-intolerance\">Malcolm Turnbull: News Corp is like a political party with the Murdochs encouraging intolerance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today Turner, now emeritus professor of media and culture at University of Queensland, sees Jones as having been at the \u201cleading edge\u201d of an important reconfiguration of mass media \u2013 from the purveying of information, to the broadcast of opinion.</p> <p>\u201cIf the thing you care about is the role of media in providing information to citizens to help them understand the world around them, then the displacement of facts with opinion is not helpful,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause so much opinion is at some distance from the facts, and in many cases unapologetically so.\u201d</p> <p>Another aspect of modern media that Jones pioneered, says Turner, was \u201cvengeful campaigning\u201d, now a feature of both shock-jockery and some newspaper coverage. \u201cIt\u2019s not been a valuable part of political discourse in Australia,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Jones began his radio career in the mid 1980s \u2013 before pay television got a grip in Australia, before Fox News started in the United States and before social media provided opinion and dubious \u201cfacts\u201d at the flick of a finger.</p> <p>By early this century, Jones was seen as uniquely influential.</p> <p>This was never only about his audience. He never swayed elections, despite perceptions to the contrary.</p> <p>His radio program was top-rating, but in a crowded market. Even at the height, most Australians and even most Sydneysiders did not listen to Alan Jones. In 2018 his audience was about 480,000 in Sydney, with a secondary audience nationwide gained through syndication.</p> <p>A study by the Australia Institute in 2006 found that Jones listeners were older, more conservative, more authoritarian and more fearful than most Australians.</p> <p>They were more likely to believe fundamental social values were under threat, less likely to see Aboriginal culture as essential to Australian society, and more likely to see obedience and respect for authority as the most important virtues to teach children. They were more likely to see homosexuality as immoral.</p> <p>In other words, not swinging voters. Jones\u2019s influence grew partly because politicians \u2013 particularly John Howard \u2013 used friendly talkback radio hosts to bypass journalists and deliver a message direct to the people.</p> <p>Interviews on talkback would be picked up and reported as news by other media, meaning that politicians were able to both speak to the conservative base and set news agendas without facing hostile questions.</p> <p>For the most part, the views that Jones broadcast would have been in accord with those of his audience.</p> <p>He is a climate change denier, for example. He has been hostile to asylum seekers.</p> <p>But he has also picked fights that don\u2019t easily fit into a left-right mould \u2013 for example his apparent vendetta against the Wagner family, blaming them for the Grantham floods, that ended in a $3.4m defamation settlement. Jones also repeatedly picked sides in murky New South Wales police politics.</p> <p>Sometimes, though, he went against the views of his audience \u2013 for example advocating a legal right to same-sex marriage in 2015.</p> <p>So was he sincere in his perpetual opinions?</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very good question,\u201d says Turner. \u201cWe never got to talk to him, and without that it is hard to judge.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a sense of a very sophisticated rhetorician \u2026 the rants that he would present were not rants in terms of being undisciplined and disorganised. They were extremely carefully structured, and he would repeat the same set of issues in slightly different ways over hours, and you would think \u2018this is really carefully written\u2019. I admired his skill.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d55adedfad7f78f5d237467babea05cd8186ac4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d55adedfad7f78f5d237467babea05cd8186ac4/0_139_4248_2548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Jones with former prime minister Tony Abbott at the launch of How Political Correctness Is Destroying Australia by Kevin Donnelly in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Jones with former prime minister Tony Abbott at the launch of How Political Correctness is Destroying Australia by Kevin Donnelly in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don Arnold/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jones never confined his influence to the program. As has been most recently revealed earlier this year, throughout his career he has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/02/with-best-wishes-alan-what-we-learned-from-alan-joness-furious-letters-to-politicians\">peppered politicians with letters pushing various agendas.</a></p> <p>John Howard, as prime minister, is said to have had staff devoted to dealing with correspondence from Jones.</p> <p>But the times have moved on. Jones is now 79. While he plans to continue his appearances on television and his newspaper columns, whether he can maintain relevance without his traditional base remains to be seen.</p> <p>The lists of times that Jones has been in trouble with the broadcasting regulators and with defamation is too long to reproduce here. Most disturbingly, in 2007 the Australian Communications and Media Authority found that he had encouraged the violence of the Cronulla riots, and the vilification of Lebanese people.</p> <p>In recent years the controversies have increasingly taken a toll on his revenue-generating capacity, due to consumer-driven advertiser boycotts. His misogyny, in particular, has cost him dearly \u2013 such as when he suggested prime minister Julia Gillard should be taken out to sea in a chaff bag, and New Zealand prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/19/my-dear-prime-minister-alan-joness-apology-letter-to-jacinda-ardern-revealed\">Jacinda Ardern should have a sock shoved down her throat</a>, and when he suggested that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/australian-radio-host-female-leaders\">women leaders were \u201cdestroying the joint\u2019</a>.</p> <p>But his influence has still been visible. For example, just two years ago NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian gave way to his suggestions that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/07/alan-jones-opera-house-row-sydney-gambling-industry-tim-costello\">the Sydney Opera House be used as an advertising billboard.</a></p> <p>But there is a sense that the audience and the formation of public opinion has moved on.</p> <p>So if Jones was at the leading edge of opinion replacing fact in popular media, where to now?</p> <p>Turner suggests that shock-jockery is moving to pay television \u2013 but the audiences are tiny.</p> <p>The Bolt Report on Sky, for example, is one of its most successful programs and gets just 250,000 viewers across multiple repeats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/25/alan-joness-radio-show-loses-hundreds-of-advertisers-since-jacinda-ardern-storm\">Alan Jones's radio show loses hundreds of advertisers since Jacinda Ardern storm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nor do the interviews and views of the SkyNews commentators usually get picked up by mainstream media \u2013 except when they intersect with issues already in the news, such as the travails of Cardinal George Pell.</p> <p>By way of comparison, the weekly Sunday morning ABC Insiders program has 548,000 viewers and its keynote political interview often sets the news agenda for the week.</p> <p>As the generation of shock-jocks to which Alan Jones belongs reaches retirement, the partisanship of SkyNews is not really an equivalent replacement.</p> <p>Instead, the influencers have shifted online, and to the reaches of YouTube and social media. There, as the New York Times show Rabbit Hole has revealed, opinions are formed and reinforced out of sight of those who don\u2019t join the conversation.</p> <p>Those conversations are no longer broadcast but narrowcast. It is a medium both intimate, and powerful.</p> <p>That brings new pathologies and dangers.</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>As the world marks and mourns the passing of Little Richard, many have been asking: how was someone so unapologetically black and queer present at the origins of rock, a world-shaking music still associated, to this day, with white male musical acts like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones?</p> <p>All these artists and more, including Bob Dylan in a Twitter thread, would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/09/little-richard-tributes-ferry-jagger-lewis-lee-duvernay\">quick to acknowledge</a> Little Richard\u2019s formative influence on them. But \u201cinfluence\u201d is perhaps too weak a word here. Rock\u2019n\u2019roll history has never exactly neglected or ignored Little Richard: it just has never quite known what to do with him. The longstanding pissing contest over who can claim the title \u201cKing of Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll\u201d \u2013 Elvis? Jerry Lee Lewis? \u2013 is a case in point. While his authorised biographer went celestial in choosing to style Richard \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/little-richard-an-appreciation-by-bill-flanagan-of-the-quasar-of-rock-n-roll/\">the Quasar of Rock</a>\u201d, perhaps we might do better to listen to the artist, introducing himself at the Club Matinee in Houston, Texas, in 1953: \u201cLittle Richard, King of the Blues \u2026 and the Queen, too!\u201d</p> <p>Might we hear in this brash boast an invitation to think in non-binary terms about Little Richard\u2019s place in black musical history? At 20 Little Richard was already a showbiz veteran of half a decade, performing first as a turbaned mysterio and then as a drag queen named Princess LaVonne in the travelling shows that plied the southern black entertainment circuit of the late 1940s. Other queens and \u201cfreakish men\u201d \u2013 as the black speech of the period named gender-non-conforming males \u2013 taught Little Richard the musical, performative and sexual ropes: performers like <a href=\"https://www.popmatters.com/esquerita-the-other-originator-of-rock-n-roll-camp-2496134735.html\">Esquerita</a>, whose flamboyant persona and piano technique inspired Richard (the question of who wore the pompadour first will probably go for ever unanswered).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cff38ba8cd8fae344dabd222effcacf064992c1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cff38ba8cd8fae344dabd222effcacf064992c1f/133_442_2162_2440/886.jpg\" alt=\"Looks familiar? \u2026 Esquerita. whose flamboyant persona and piano technique inspired Little Richard.\" width=\"886\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Looks familiar? \u2026 Esquerita. whose flamboyant persona and piano technique inspired Little Richard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These transgressively queer performers of a bawdy, sped-up blues, and the black publics they performed it for, were overlooked by a generation of white male critics and collectors eager to fetishise the rural: Robert Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/21/mississippi-bluesman-robert-johnson-son-wins-photo-profits\">standing at a lonesome crossroads in the Mississippi Delta</a>. As historian <a href=\"https://www.history.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-marybeth-hamilton\">Marybeth Hamilton</a> notes, rock\u2019n\u2019roll was thought by these critics to be \u201ca factory product that diluted, even perverted, black performance traditions for sale to undiscerning consumers who, if anything, preferred the fake stuff to the real\u201d.</p> <p>Yet the urban blues \u2013 in which black women\u2019s voices and concerns had been central since the 1920s \u2013 supplied the soundtrack to a black sexual underground that was remarkably widespread, durable, and even popular in the Jim Crow era. Take the jump blues of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woGPen168f4\">Billy Wright</a>, the \u201cslow drag\u201d vocal style of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcAeTEhKiGQ\">Big Maybelle</a>, or the \u201chip shakin\u2019 mama\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nola.com/entertainment_life/music/article_069a9bdc-f68e-5b22-9e78-e7f0bc5f6e4e.html\">Patsy Vidalia</a>, the drag queen who MCed New Orleans club the Dew Drop Inn and threw the city\u2019s annual Gay Ball. Although the crossover from this rhythm and blues to rock\u2019n\u2019roll might have meant the loss of an audience that knew the song Lucille was about a drag queen, or that Tutti Frutti began as an ode to anal sex, the frank and exuberant world from which they \u2013 and Little Richard \u2013 sprang, has left plenty of evidence for black feminist, queer, and trans musical histories to uncover (and for motivated digital crate-diggers to seek out).</p> <p>Any understanding of Little Richard\u2019s career has also been inhibited by the tendency to see individuals \u2013 and history itself \u2013 as always moving from the narrowly religious towards the wider secular world. The almost universal dismissal of Little Richard\u2019s gospel output by rock critics is a case in point. One suspects that this dismissal is motivated by the artist\u2019s own declaration that his gospel records and ministerial career represent a recantation of his wild and wayward life as a rock\u2019n\u2019roller; the prodigal son\u2019s return.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"115b68b80157d6ae0f5fc84632d764c5b65a39f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/115b68b80157d6ae0f5fc84632d764c5b65a39f3/0_109_2208_2889/764.jpg\" alt=\"Sexual rebel \u2026 Sister Rosetta Tharpe.\" width=\"764\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sexual rebel \u2026 Sister Rosetta Tharpe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, although Richard did indeed originally leave his religious household in Macon, Georgia, in order to perform the bawdy and profane music it prohibited, he retained a lifelong devotion to the church, and its gospel is arguably as fundamental to grasping his sound as his secular influences. A non-binary history would highlight the decisive influence on Little Richard of the guitar-swinging gospel performer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9a49oFalZE\">Sister Rosetta Tharpe</a>, whose career was a series of rebellions against the strictures placed upon women within the church and black people in America. He may not have known that Sister Rosetta also took same-sex lovers, but he did remember that she gave him his first paying gig when she invited him, aged just 14, to open for her show in Macon.</p> <p>Indeed, the separation between secular and sacred performance \u2013 no matter how fiercely it tends to be enforced on either side \u2013 might need to be bridged in order to truly appreciate the ecstasy in Little Richard\u2019s sound. In all the hollerin\u2019 and screamin\u2019 that earned young Richard the nickname War Hawk while singing in church as a child, we might hear an \u201caesthetics of possibility\u201d as scholar <a href=\"https://ashoncrawley.com/\">Ashon Crawley </a>terms it in his book Blackpentecostal Breath. He writes of a collective breathing practice particular to Pentecostal worship \u2013 with its signature ecstatic method of \u201cspeaking in tongues\u201d \u2013 and holds it up as an inexhaustible and improvisatory response to brutal violence against black bodies, past and present. Little Richard rattled the dance halls with the power of this breath.</p> <p>When Little Richard died, among the remembrances I read was one from the queer performance artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jun/02/ron-athey-incorruptible-flesh-messianic-remains-review\">Ron Athey</a> (also brought up in the Pentecostal church), of the gift of a religious tract that the star offered when they met in Los Angeles. I also recall Richard\u2019s offerings of tracts and ministry after his rock concerts, like the one I attended at BB King\u2019s Bar and Grill in 2007. As different as his recorded rock and gospel output might sound, there is also something unified \u2013 what I would term blackqueer \u2013 in the continuous breath with which he voiced them both.</p> <p>Like many of my generation, born in the 1970s, I first became aware of Little Richard when he effectively <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYvUDkfBAIQ\">snatched the wig off the Grammys</a> in 1988. Invited to announce the best new artist award, he brought the audience to their feet by castigating the Recording Academy\u2019s failure to ever give him an award, which he proceeded to remedy by repeatedly announcing himself as the winner. At the time I was anxiously torn between nominees <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQL-B3PNkeI\">Jody Watley </a>and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dluHzQhLcME\">Terence Trent D\u2019Arby</a> (Watley won), so I mistook Richard to be a campy relic from another era. Rewatching this scene now on YouTube, I see a masterclass in how to take up a space that you have already earned more than twice over. I hear the connections between the femme emancipation in Little Richard\u2019s wayward Lucille (\u201cYou won\u2019t do your sister\u2019s will\u201d) and Watley\u2019s independent 80s woman \u201clooking for a new love\u201d. I understand how much of the DNA for D\u2019Arby\u2019s soulful rock stomp and vocal pyrotechnics on a song like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlmKCj03fHw\">Dance Little Sister</a> comes from one like Little Richard\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ6akiGRcL8\">Good Golly, Miss Molly</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYvUDkfBAIQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wYvUDkfBAIQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>And the award goes to me! \u2026 Little Richard at the 1988 Grammys.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Rock\u2019n\u2019roll, legend has it, helped integrate America in the 1950s. The scene Little Richard made at the 1988 Grammys was a caution against thinking about music history in such progressive, putatively post-racial terms. He instead called attention to the ways in which black innovation can get reduced to what historian <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/author/V/S/au6154961.html\">Shane Vogel </a>called \u201cblack fad performance\u201d: novelty that can be quickly consumed and then forgotten. From <a href=\"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/lifestyle/entertainment/writer-of-harry-belafontes-calypso-hit-day-o-dies-aged-95/\">Harry Belafonte\u2019s Calypso</a> in the 1950s to black TikTok dancers today, blackqueer performers are especially vulnerable to being received as fabulous but disposable. History gets sorted out into who counts and who doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>As white nationalism has returned to the corridors of power in the US, challenging easy tales of historical progress, we all could do well to consider the inspiriting power of blackqueer Pentecostal breath, and the way it allows those who breathe it to survive, resist and flourish. I think about the massive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_Station_(Macon,_Georgia)\">Beaux Arts train station in Macon, Georgia</a>, designed by the same architect as New York City\u2019s Grand Central Station, a monument to the segregated world that Little Richard Penniman was born into. The sign designating the \u201ccolored waiting room\u201d, to the left side of the main entrance to the grand hall, is literally chiselled in stone, as confident a prediction of the permanence of white supremacy as one could imagine. The layout of the station clearly indicated the subordinate position black Americans had in the country that they built.

He was forced off the air in late 2018 due to painful back spasms and has recovered from a near-fatal <em>E coli</em> infection.</p> \n<p>Now, he says, the time has come to listen to the doctors and step down from a gruelling schedule that saw him rise at 2.30am every weekday to host his program.</p> \n<h2>Cash for comment</h2> \n<p>The Ardern comments came almost a decade after Jones shocked with harsh comments about Gillard. In 2011 Jones said she should be \u201cput in a chaff bag\u201d and dumped at sea, and then came back the following year with more insults after the death of her father.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery person in the caucus of the Labor party knows that Julia Gillard is a liar, everybody,\u201d Jones said at a Sydney University Liberal club dinner. \u201cI will come to that in a moment. The old man recently died a few weeks ago of shame. To think that he has a daughter who told lies every time she stood for parliament.\u201d</p> \n<p>He also said the Labor leader was only ahead in the polls because she had been crying publicly after the death of her father.</p> \n<p>\u201cOf course she\u2019s ahead in preferred prime minister,\u201d he said. \u201cShe cries because her father died, she\u2019s on the news every day.\u201d</p> \n<p>The comments, secretly recorded by a journalist, were condemned by both sides of politics. The former Labor premier Bob Carr said they were \u201cindecent\u201d and a petition calling for Jones to be sacked received more than 35,000 signatures. Macquarie conceded the incident cost it $1.5m in lost revenue after an advertiser boycott.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e79757d1a683de3a7ce36cebe3f62d2f6da8bafc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e79757d1a683de3a7ce36cebe3f62d2f6da8bafc/0_105_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Gillard during question time, 4 June 2013\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Jones was condemned by both sides of politics for his remarks about Julia Gillard to a Sydney University Liberal club dinner in 2011.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jones\u2019s first major professional challenge as a broadcaster was the cash for comment inquiry in 1999, which resulted in a suite of new rules to prevent commercial broadcasters using their platforms to secretly promote brands.</p> \n<p>Jones \u2013 who was compelled to give evidence at the inquiry \u2013 was found by the Australian Broadcasting Authority to have been making unscripted comments favourable to Telstra and Qantas, who had undisclosed contracts with the broadcaster. Despite months of negative headlines, Jones survived at 2UE and went on to make even more money when he took up an offer from John Singleton to defect to 2GB in 2001.</p> \n<p>Six years later, Jones was scrutinised by the media watchdog again over his role in the Cronulla riots. He read out a text message from a listener, which asked people to \u201cCome to Cronulla this weekend to take revenge ... get down to North Cronulla\u201d.</p> \n<p>Jones also told a caller who said she\u2019d heard derogatory remarks about Middle Eastern people at Cronulla not to get \u201ccarried away\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s not get too carried away \u2026 We don\u2019t have Anglo-Saxon kids out there raping women in western Sydney.\u201d</p> \n<p>In 2007 the Australian Communications and Media Authority found that 2GB and Jones had broadcast material that was \u201clikely to encourage violence or brutality and to vilify people of Lebanese and Middle Eastern backgrounds on the basis of ethnicity\u201d.</p> \n<p>Jones did not accept the finding and challenged the authority through the courts, but lost. Seven years after making the remarks he was forced to read out a prepared statement on air after his own apology did not satisfy the courts.</p> \n<p>A year earlier Jones had been found in breach of the commercial radio standards over his reporting on environmental issues when the authority ruled he had failed to be accurate and had failed to allow other viewpoints to be heard.

  "<p>With a <a href=\"http://svkindofblue.com/\">3,600-mile</a><a href=\"http://svkindofblue.com/\"> non-stop solo sail</a> across the Atlantic ahead of him, Garry Crothers is a little anxious. But he has to get moving before the hurricane season. \u201cI\u2019m in a bad place here, I don\u2019t have any choice,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Like many living aboard their sailing boats, he has been stranded at sea by Covid-19. The 64-year-old Irishman has been on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sv_kindofblue/?igshid=9c2gsz26vghv\">Kind of Blue</a>, his 43ft aluminium boat, for two months, hardly touching land. He\u2019s anchored off Sint Maarten, in the Caribbean \u2013 a less pleasing prospect than it sounds. Hurricane season officially starts on 1 June and the island, as Crothers is acutely aware, is \u201cbang in the middle of the hurricane belt\u201d \u2013 hit hard by Dorian last year, and Irma in 2017. Neighbouring countries and islands that might afford protection are shut. Crothers\u2019 only safe option is a solo sail home to Ireland.</p> <p>In one sense he\u2019s not alone. An estimated 500 boats are crossing the Atlantic to Europe in the coming weeks. From the South Pacific to the Indian Ocean, thousands of people are trying to sail home or find shelter.</p> <p>While stranded cruise and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-tests-us-navy-ship-sailors-national-guard-military-guam-uss-theodore-roosevelt-a9429056.html\">navy ships have made headlines</a>, far less attention has been paid to the plight of hundreds of families and individuals on small boats. As countries closed borders, numerous vessels were refused entry to their port of call. Even boats that had been safely anchored before the pandemic were suddenly considered a foreign yacht in territorial waters. Sailors in Portugal and Spain were ordered to return to home ports in the United States or Canada \u2013 a dangerous proposition without planning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BvEUa77nwc6/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Families with young children have been threatened with arrest, having their boats seized, or being towed out to open water for trying to anchor in sheltered bays, looking for food and water. Thousands have been left with nowhere to go and are undertaking risky passages. People sailing the coasts of Sri Lanka, India, and through the pirate-infested Gulf of Aden to the Horn of Africa, report being forced out to sea by navy gunboats patrolling coastlines. Many have been charged exorbitant prices for life-sustaining supplies as they rapidly run out of cash. Daria Blackwell of the Ocean Cruising Club (OCC) says risky journeys have become common: \u201cOne boat arrived in South Africa, was turned away and had to continue on to St Helena [a journey of more than 1,200 nautical miles] running short of food, fuel and water,\u201d she says. It was headed for the US but, with non-citizens onboard, not guaranteed entry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/no-one-comes-the-cruise-ship-crews-cast-adrift-by-coronavirus\">\u2018No one comes': the cruise ship crews cast adrift by coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The only place people can expect to be accepted \u2013 and therefore safe \u2013 is their home country. But that presents a problem of epic proportions. Many sailors are far from wealthy: their home is their boat, they hadn\u2019t planned for a sudden ocean passage, and now have to cross in conditions they wouldn\u2019t otherwise attempt. Lockdown means it has been impossible to source spares or safety gear ahead of the trip, while travel restrictions have meant many can\u2019t get anyone to join as crew. And while most insurance policies stipulate certain crew numbers for the crossing, they also deny storm cover to boats left in hurricane zones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"02128394bc9df62eed290811b9ac12efb7e16543\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02128394bc9df62eed290811b9ac12efb7e16543/0_0_5313_3542/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bar mascot at the Sint Maarten Yacht Club wears a face mask while it is closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The normally busy Sint Maarten Yacht Club Bar &amp; Restaurant is currently occupied by a lonely mascot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MG Photography/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like many others, Crothers has to choose the least worst option \u2013 face hurricane season or cross alone \u2013 both without cover. Even food provisioning is tricky. In Sint Maarten food shops have only recently reopened. \u201cMy other concern is trying to socially distance while getting supplies for the trip,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m in the age bracket where I can\u2019t afford to get [coronavirus]. Or to get ill in the middle of the Atlantic.\u201d </p> <p>In these difficult circumstances, sailors are turning to one another for support. They are a resourceful breed \u2013 offshore cruising demands it, given the myriad problems that can arise in the middle of the ocean. The OCC has connected more than 150 boats in the west Atlantic heading for Europe: they\u2019re sharing information and offering support on the crossing. This is not an organised flotilla \u2013 boats are leaving from as far afield as Antigua, Jamaica and Mexico to destinations ranging from Russia to the UK, Sweden to Greece. Skippers will make their own decisions on routes and speeds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I go over, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s hard enough for an able man to get back on board \u2013 but with one hand?</p> <footer> <cite>Garry Crothers, sailor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However they\u2019re jointly tracking journeys, so if problems arise there\u2019s some prospect of help from others within range. In the first groups to leave, two boats with emergency medical workers and one with a surgeon onboard have offered assistance with medical support while at sea; one boat has helped another with water supply.</p> <p>Crothers has signed up to the list. He is an experienced sailor, but hasn\u2019t done a transatlantic alone. The longest single-handed trip he\u2019s done so far is five days. \u201cCorrection,\u201d he says. \u201cAll my trips are single-handed.\u201d After a car crash and years of pain, he had his left arm amputated in 2017. \u201cMy biggest worry is fixing things one-handed,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m pretty good, but it\u2019s difficult without dropping things, and trying to hold on to the boat.\u201d</p> <p>His first heading will be north, a route many are taking towards Bermuda. Once he has reached the high pressure area, he should pick up westerly winds to sail slowly towards the Azores. From there, he\u2019ll head for Northern Ireland, taking more than three weeks. He has to sail conservatively. \u201cBecause if I go over, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s hard enough for an able man to get back on board \u2013 but with one hand?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/atlantic-zip/giv-39025v67Kbg8JJ2F/\" data-alt=\"Crothers' journey home\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/atlantic-zip/giv-39025v67Kbg8JJ2F/\">Crothers' journey home</a> </figure>  <p>The Azores have been a beacon of light in the Atlantic during this crisis. The archipelago, about 800 nautical miles off the coast of Portugal, is of huge strategic importance for boats crossing west to east. Countries along the Atlantic\u2019s eastern shores \u2013 Morocco, Senegal, Spain, Portugal, France \u2013 have been turning away boats looking for shelter. Island nations such as Cape Verde, off the coast of Africa, lack infrastructure and healthcare to deal with Covid-19, so are more understandably off limits. As Blackwell points out, \u201cPeople are so panicked in countries that don\u2019t have adequate healthcare, they will do anything to protect themselves.\u201d But grateful sailors have been reporting that they could anchor in Horta, the Azores\u2019 port, with access to fuel and water. The islands have a long history of welcoming boats on transatlantic passages, and maritime institution Peter Cafe Sport has been taking food, medical supplies and marine parts to anchored boats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f30de8b2248e6c3967e9f8a48981f5212ca6a1cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f30de8b2248e6c3967e9f8a48981f5212ca6a1cf/0_0_1080_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Men wearing masks and high viz jackets outside Peter Cafe Sport, Azores\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Cafe Sport has been taking food, medical supplies and marine parts to anchored boats.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: petercafesport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As welcome as this is, lying at anchor doesn\u2019t afford full protection from weather, or the opportunity to rest, make repairs and plan in the middle of exhausting passages. Which is why sailors have been lobbying governments. <a href=\"https://floatmagazin.de/leute/stranded-in-madeira-sailing-corona-crisis/\">Sailor and journalist Ole Sal</a> has formally applied to the regional governments of Madeira and the Azores, and to Portugal, France and Spain, to provide safe havens, arguing that the lack of open ports is \u201cincreasing the risk of loss of life and damage to vessels\u201d. In Lisbon, yachtmaster Veronique Claus has written to Portugal\u2019s president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, on behalf of 30 international boats. \u201cCertainly for those who are anchored in unsafe and non-sheltered waters, the situation is life-threatening,\u201d she says, noting that two yachts have already been lost after breaking anchors.</p> <p>Crothers will pass near the Azores, but may not stop if restrictions mean he has to stay on anchor; dozens of others, however, including Britons <a href=\"https://ellieandjohn.com/\">Elena and John Nye</a>, are counting on the stopover for fuel and water (their small boat won\u2019t carry enough). The 33-year-olds, \u201crelative newcomers\u201d to sailing, set off from the British Virgin Islands for Norway on their 34ft sailboat, and hope to rest in the Azores before the onward journey. The Caledonian canal \u2013 a shortcut through the north of Scotland \u2013 is now closed, so they face a difficult passage via the Shetland Islands, where gale-force winds and perilous seas are common. They should get some shelter in the Western Isles, as the UK is operating some key ports and marinas for transit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/18/what-four-years-at-sea-taught-me-about-our-relationship-to-the-ocean\">What four years at sea taught me about our relationship to the ocean</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For those heading east towards Spanish and Portuguese coasts, and into the Mediterranean for France, Italy, Greece and elsewhere, it\u2019s a mixed picture. Select ports are allowing entry with authorisation, but authorities are policing territorial waters vigorously and it could be costly to get it wrong.

He is looking forward to a pint of Guinness, but the journey is long, and the illusion of strength in numbers falls away when you\u2019re crossing the ocean in very different boats, with different speeds and routes. \u201cUltimately,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019re alone out there.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Retirement is treating Pat C Rollo well. Just weeks after the coronavirus pandemic closed his workplace for good, he has moved into a modern apartment in south Florida and enjoys long, leisurely walks watching the yachts on the Intracoastal Waterway before heading home for a nap. He even has a new name \u2013 Lambo, short for Lamborghini \u2013 as a reminder of the fast-paced industry in which he once worked.</p> <p>It was a swift, and fortunate, transformation for a racing greyhound who never distinguished himself in 97 outings over 20 months under the Rollo moniker, yet always seemed to enjoy the thrill of chasing an electric hare around the track at the Daytona Beach Racing and Card Club.</p> <p>When Daytona\u2019s owners, starved of paying customers due to the Covid-19 lockdown, brought down the shutters on 20 March after 71 years of live greyhound racing, Lambo and 600 other greyhounds suddenly found themselves not just out of work, but instantly homeless. Thanks to a hastily scrambled caravan of volunteers from the Awesome Greyhound Adoptions agency willing to drive the 420-mile round trip from Boynton Beach, several dozen dogs traveled south to temporary foster homes or, as in Lambo\u2019s case, permanent new digs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"90061b0602caa6c0417a2ea31afe29b03a805a6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90061b0602caa6c0417a2ea31afe29b03a805a6f/0_60_591_1167/506.jpg\" alt=\"Pat C Rollo, aka Lambo,\" width=\"506\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pat C Rollo, aka Lambo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Portela family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re keeping each other going,\u201d says Lambo\u2019s new owner, Courtney Portela, 38, a bartender from Boynton who also lost her job in the pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m helping him out by showing him a good new life, and he\u2019s helping me out by keeping me motivated at a time when everything\u2019s up in the air,\u201d she says of the three-and-a-half-year-old she calls her \u201c45mph couch potato\u201d.</p> <p>Portela saw on the news that Florida\u2019s greyhound tracks were closing because of the pandemic and that dogs were in need of homes, but that doesn\u2019t reflect the magnitude of the challenge that has befallen the state\u2019s network of adoption agencies almost instantaneously.</p> <p>Other long-established greyhound racing tracks in Naples and Sanford closed permanently in short order of Daytona, the former having soldiered on with televised races but no spectators for several weeks before bowing to the inevitable. Meanwhile, circuits in West Palm Beach, St Petersburg and Jacksonville suspended operations indefinitely with their futures uncertain. It left 1,500 greyhounds, by many estimates, in need of immediate rehoming. Roughly another 3,000 are still in kennels at the remaining three venues, all of which must close by law at the end of the year anyway when Florida becomes the 41st state to outlaw commercial dog racing.</p> <p>In truth, the popularity of a wagering activity legalized in 1931 as a mechanism to replenish state coffers depleted by the Great Depression has been declining for years. The anti-racing group Grey2K USA says gambling revenues dropped 57 % from 2006 to 2016, spectatorship has dwindled and a state that once attracted cultural icons such as Frank Sinatra and Babe Ruth to dog race meetings, boasted 20 tracks in its late-1980s heyday and still had 11 tracks two years ago, is down to its final three.</p> <p>Even so, Amendment 13, the 2018 ballot initiative that ended dog racing by a two-to-one majority, and which was reaffirmed by a federal judge last month, allowed for an orderly, rolling program of closures by January 2021. The intention was to allow the volunteer groups time to absorb the dogs instead of being overwhelmed all at once, but coronavirus has upended that situation.</p> <p>\u201cWith tracks closing earlier than expected, it\u2019s a perfect storm of greyhounds needing homes at one of the worst times in US history,\u201d said Dennis Tyler, president of Greyhound Pet Adoptions of Central Florida. \u201cFortunately most of the groups in Florida scattered dogs across the country to different groups that could take them and start the adoption process, but Florida is saturated with greyhounds as far as local adoptions.\u201d</p> <p>Rescue groups hastily assembled teams of volunteers to drive hundreds of dogs to sister agencies in California, Tennessee and New England. Others, from the Naples track in particular, will race on for the time being, in Arkansas or at Iowa\u2019s sole remaining track in Dubuque, before eventually being rehomed as pets.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a much better place to be doing it,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cYou can disperse them to Canada and northern states. In Florida you have to get a couple of states out to where it\u2019s not overloaded with greyhounds.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"115abfcd24a2c9e97920ac652b8f28d517ceefa5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/115abfcd24a2c9e97920ac652b8f28d517ceefa5/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greyhounds race by at the Sanford Orlando Kennel Club in Longwood, FL on Thursday, July 26, 2018.
