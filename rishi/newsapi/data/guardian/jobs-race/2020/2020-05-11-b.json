  "<p>The chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak\">Rishi Sunak</a>, has been urged to extend the coronavirus wage subsidy scheme until September to avoid spiralling job losses across Britain this summer.</p> <p>Against a backdrop of mounting pressure on the government to provide continued support as lockdown measures are gradually removed, the Resolution Foundation said the extension would cost the exchequer as much as \u00a348bn but would prevent a fresh surge in unemployment.</p> <p>After Boris Johnson announced on Sunday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/10/boris-johnson-coronavirus-lockdown-shops-schools-june-reopening\">his blueprint for the gradual lifting of restrictions</a>, industry groups warned it was incomplete without urgent details about the job retention scheme.</p> <p>Lex Butler, the chair of the Hotel Booking Agents Association, said: \u201cWe immediately need to know that the furlough scheme will be extended beyond the end of June and on what terms. We need clarity now to prevent closures and large scale loss of jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Employees in the hospitalities sector are expected to return to work last, possibly from July.</p> <p>Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cFirms will need to know that government support schemes, which have helped save millions of jobs in recent weeks, will continue for as long as they are needed so that they can plan ahead with confidence.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson told parliament on Monday that Sunak would announce details on the future of the furlough scheme on Tuesday. The chancellor is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/rishi-sunak-preparing-to-wind-down-furlough-scheme-from-july\">widely expected to announce the gradual wind-down</a> of the scheme amid rising concern over its cost, which is roughly \u00a314bn a month.</p> <p>Under the scheme, workers receive 80% of their pay up to \u00a32,500 a month. More than 6 million were protected at 800,000 firms in the first two weeks of the scheme\u2019s operation.</p> <p>Options the Treasury is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/parts-of-uk-economy-on-life-support-since-lockdown\">understood to be considering</a> include cutting the level of support to 60% while allowing staff to work some of their hours.</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation urged the government to allow for \u201cpartial furloughing\u201d from as early as June, but said the 80% support should also be kept in place across the economy until at least August. It could then gradually be scaled back.</p> <p>However, the thinktank recommends 80% support continuing until at least September for businesses in sectors where the return to work will take longer, including hospitality.</p> <p>Sunak is under pressure from business leaders to provide an update this week because employers have to allow for at least 45 days to consult on redundancies of more than 100 staff. Companies face a deadline of 18 May to begin the redundancy consultation process if the furlough is no longer available in July.</p> <p>Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cMoving too quickly could spark a huge second surge in job losses at a time when unemployment already looks set to be at the highest level for a quarter of a century.</p> <p>\u201cThe scheme cannot last forever however. It should be phased out gradually, with a longer timeframe for the hardest-hit sectors.\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday Johnson said it was time for sectors in which home-working was not possible \u2013 including manufacturing and construction \u2013 to get back to work.</p> <p>But the Confederation of British Metalforming (CBM), which represents about 200 manufacturing companies across Britain, said it would take longer for the economy to recover and that further financial support would be required while production levels remain below normal.</p> <p>The CBM said up to 30% of jobs (12,000) among its members could be cut if assistance was taken away at the end of June.</p> <p>The finance lobby group TheCityUK said it expected UK firms would face unsustainable debts of up to \u00a3105bn that would need to be managed before March next year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alongside continued support from the government, the major <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/uk-economy-to-shrink-by-25-percent-and-unemployment-to-double-warns-bank-of-england-coronavirus\">high street banks have been ordered</a> by the Bank of England to make more loans to firms to help keep them running.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Treasury said the job retention scheme had already protected millions of jobs. </p> <p>\u201cFuture decisions around the scheme will take into account the wider context of the measures in place, as well as the public health response,\u201d they said. \u201cWe have been clear there will be no cliff edge and people will be eased back into work in a measured way.\u201d</p>",

Gen Joseph Lengyel tested positive at the White House on Saturday in a spot check, before he was to meet Trump.</p> <p>A valet for Trump, who had served the president food without wearing a mask, also recently tested positive. The White House is considering new rules under which aides must maintain a distance of two metres (6ft) from the president, ABC News reported.</p> <p>Pence\u2019s spokeswoman, Katie Miller, the wife of Stephen Miller, one of the president\u2019s closest aides, who is in frequent close contact with the Trump family, tested positive last week. It was unclear if Stephen Miller had entered self-isolation.</p> <p>\u201cThere is extreme sensitivity inside the White House right now at the current state of affairs \u2013 officials recognise the contradiction in telling states to reopen while the White House enhances protocols to prevent spread of the virus,\u201d CNN quoted an anonymous Trump administration official as saying.</p> <p>On Monday morning the number of recorded Covid-19 deaths in the US was close to 80,000, and while the rate of new cases appears to be slowing in the New York City area and other sites of major outbreaks, elsewhere new infections are rising.</p> <p>Nowhere is testing and contact-tracing for the virus as thoroughly as the White House, where aides and senior officials including Trump and Pence receive both spot checks and repeated testing in various forms, some on a daily basis.

  "<p>Yeah yeah yeah, I know, it\u2019s like we\u2019re living in a Black Mirror episode. We\u2019ve got headless robot dogs <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/coronavirus-lockdown-singapore-robot-dog-spot-boston-dynamics-a9506781.html\">patrolling Singaporean parks</a> to enforce social distancing, we\u2019re all trapped on social media which is now just a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=alison%20roman&amp;src=typed_query\">rolling</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=liz%20bruenig&amp;src=typed_query\">cancellation</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=amanda%20palmer&amp;src=typed_query\">colosseum</a> where soon each user will have their time of standing before the masses and hearing exactly what everyone thinks of them, and who needs killer bee drones when we have murder hornets.</p> <p>If we have Black Mirror on our news do we really need Black Mirror on our Netflix? The creator himself says no. Charlie Brooker gave <a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/news/on-demand/2020-05-04/black-mirror-6-update/\">an interview</a> to Radio Times saying he doesn\u2019t think audiences would have the stomach for a dystopia right now, as we seem to be living through the beginning stages of societal collapse with our pandemic lockdowns and mass unemployment.</p> <p>But I for one urge our creators to bring on the darkness.</p> <p>During some of the bleakest years of the recent past, with an endless war conducted in multiple countries mostly with drones, a migrant crisis caused by people fleeing war and economic devastation, an economy that benefited the few and left everyone else scrambling to monetize every aspect of their lives they could think of just to survive \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not using this second bedroom/car/blood plasma right now, what if I found a way to charge someone for it\u201d \u2013 we somehow got addicted to cutesy pop self-empowerment anthems.</p> <p>We had bright little pop stars, trained from birth to be cheery, professional, and approachable, all vaguely looking the same like they all came out of the same laboratory (or at least the same plastic surgeon\u2019s office), bouncing up and down and singing songs about how great we are all doing. \u201cCause I\u2019m a champion and you\u2019re gonna hear me roar\u201d and \u201cCause baby you\u2019re a firework, come on show them what you\u2019re worth\u201d and whatever else. Like ceaseless robotic cheerleaders designed by Lisa Frank, hysterically celebrating us as we grind and hustle our way to poverty and early death. And yes, there was a Black Mirror episode about that, too.</p> <p>I\u2019m not saying pop music was to blame for our inability to notice the game was fixed or to organize and fight against the gig economy and the supreme wealth of our oligarchs and technocrats, but certainly it was an effective means of escapism. Outside was a burning hellscape of environmental collapse and militarized police, but all we had to do to break free from that was put on our headphones or look at our devices and suddenly it was all rainbows and candy colored fantasy.</p> <p>And why not try to escape all of this? But personally, the cognitive dissonance was too harsh. The transition from the horrifying headlines of war and illness and suffering to Taylor Swift in a bathtub filled with jewels was giving me migraines. \u201cActually, I\u2019m not feeling great about being me,\u201d I whispered back to Swift as I lay in bed in the same clothes I wore on each of the previous three days. \u201cAt this rate I\u2019ll never be able to buy a couch that isn\u2019t secondhand let alone diamonds,\u201d I psychically projected toward Ariana Grande.</p> <p>Black Mirror debuted back in 2011 when we were all still very optimistic about the ability for technology to reshape and reconnect the world. Twitter and Facebook being praised for its ability to bring down despotic governments, not undermine democratic elections or facilitate genocide. Instagram was about sharing, not causing depression or fostering <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om3r1qKnwS0\">suicide cults</a>.</p> <p>These two worlds seemed to converge in 2016 with the release of season three when Netflix went down because a bunch of teenagers \u2013 maybe, we have no idea \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/26/ddos-attack-dyn-mirai-botnet\">brought down the internet</a> by hacking wifi-enabled appliances. I was sitting on my couch wondering why I couldn\u2019t load the season premiere, having no idea it was because people didn\u2019t change the passwords on their dishwashers. Because of the work of good journalists and whistleblowers and yes some television programs, we\u2019re all a little more aware of the dark side of our tech-infused world and a little less optimistic that it will solve rather than create problems.</p> <p>We look to our entertainment to do too much for us these days. We look to our television series to provide moral instruction, we argue about whether or not characters are good \u201crole models,\u201d we fight over accurate representation. For godsake, we announce our Harry Potter houses like it means something, looking to the great sorting hat of the sky to give us a coherent sense of self.</p> <p>So I\u2019m not looking for a television show to solve this crisis or give us an illumined path toward a rebuilt society. Billionaires are profiting off the hundreds of thousands of Covid-19 deaths and the mass unemployment and <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/05/08/andrew-cuomo-eric-schmidt-coronavirus-tech-shock-doctrine/\">tech titans</a> are using the power vacuum to remake the world according to their vision and <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/n7jaw7/amazon-fresh-whole-foods-delivery-time-slot-bots\">the only people who can get grocery delivery</a> are the ones who know how to install a bot and I don\u2019t know how to install a bot so I can\u2019t get Cheez Its. So don\u2019t tell me how great I\u2019m doing or sell me some fantasy of self-improvement. Bring back the dystopia. Because right now I can\u2019t stand being lied to.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jessa Crispin is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Set in a tiny Caribbean village in the 1970s, this charming yet clear-eyed romance begins with a fisherman, David, lazily awaiting his catch only to snare a centuries-old mermaid, Aycayia, cursed by women jealous of her beauty. She\u2019s drawn to the sound of the guitar he\u2019s strumming; he wonders if he\u2019s been smoking too many spliffs.<br><br>The bittersweet plot kicks in when their regular secret meetings are brought to an end by Thomas and Hank, a Florida father and son trawling island waters in the hope of bagging first prize in a fishing contest. Suddenly, they\u2019re thinking big \u2013 a sale to the Smithsonian, the cover of <em>Time</em> \u2013 but don\u2019t reckon with David\u2019s plan to rescue her...<br><br>Roffey cuts between these characters and the various other islanders who stick their oar into the affair, including a venal police chief eyeing a quick buck by helping Thomas and Hank take back what they regard as their property, and Miss Rain, a white landowner whose attempt to do the right thing is hampered by the fact that her ancestors profited from the legacy of slavery. We also get snippets of rough-hewn poetry from Aycayia\u2019s point of view (\u201cthe Yankee men/ have big big boat/ Frighten bad I swim down down\u201d) as well as David\u2019s recollections 40 years after the episode: \u201cI am an ol\u2019 man now, and sick sick so I cyan move much, sick so I cyan work ... so I go write my story.\u201d<br><br>What makes the novel sing is how Roffey fleshes out these mythical goings-on with pin-sharp detail from the real world, as Aycayia, hidden away in David\u2019s bedroom, navigates the perils (and pleasures) of life on land. After her tail rots, she relearns to walk in an old pair of David\u2019s green suede Adidas. Her nostrils bleed \u201call kind of molluscs and tiny crabs\u201d. David worries that the smell and the noise of her wordless song might attract nosy neighbours, not least Priscilla, whose mean-spirited meddling injects a dose of malevolent comic energy into the action.<br><br>Ultimately, this is the archetypal story of a disruptive outsider whose arrival alters a community by revealing it to itself, not always happily. For Thomas, dismayed by his poetry-reading son, Aycayia\u2019s appearance represents a chance to assert his masculinity; the novel\u2019s uglier moments involve the instincts of men intent on her defilement. But there\u2019s sweetness, too: a shared love of bass-heavy reggae allows Aycayia to form a friendship with a deaf 10-year-old, while David learns to separate sexual desire from his desire for possession.<br><br>All the same, <em>The Mermaid of Black Conch</em> is no fairytale and there\u2019s a limit to how well Aycayia\u2019s story can end. \u201cWomanhood was a dangerous business if you didn\u2019t get it right,\u201d someone thinks. You don\u2019t have to squint too hard to see the magic-realist shenanigans of this playful <em>Pygmalion</em> narrative as a means of sugaring that rather bitter pill.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Mermaid of Black Conch</em> by Monique Roffey is published by Peepal Tree Press (\u00a39.99).
