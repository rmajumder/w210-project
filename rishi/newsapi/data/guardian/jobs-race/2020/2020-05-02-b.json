  "<p>The White House has blocked Dr Anthony Fauci from testifying to Congress, saying it would be \u201ccounterproductive\u201d for the senior member of the White House coronavirus taskforce to talk about the government\u2019s response to the pandemic in a House committee hearing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/02/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-testing\">No leadership and no plan: is Trump about to fail the US on coronavirus testing?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Donald Trump, meanwhile, welcomed Mitch McConnell\u2019s move to recall the Senate to Washington despite the congressional physician\u2019s office reportedly telling Republicans it would not be able to screen all 100 senators for Covid-19 on Monday.</p> <p>The president also called the Democratic House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, \u201ccrazy\u201d for not recalling the House and moved to remove a health department watchdog who wrote a critical report on the government\u2019s pandemic response.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/30/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">researchers at Johns Hopkins university</a>, the US has recorded more than 1.1m coronavirus cases and more than 65,000 deaths. On Friday, Trump <a href=\"https://publicpool.kinja.com/subject-remarks-by-president-trump-in-a-presidential-r-1843206027\">told reporters</a>: \u201cHopefully, we\u2019re going to come in below \u2026 100,000 lives lost.\u201d</p> <p>Fauci, 79, has worked at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-meet-the-scientists-who-are-now-household-names\">National Institutes of Health since 1968</a>. A source of measured, expert analysis on the Covid-19 outbreak in press briefings and interviews, his public profile has risen. This has put him at odds with Trump, who has downplayed the pandemic and disputed facts about the crisis.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/19/trump-fauci-relationship-coronavirus-us\">Fauci and Trump\u2019s disparate responses</a> have left many concerned the president will attempt to silence the doctor or push him out entirely. In April, Trump retweeted a post calling for Fauci to be fired but he has denied that he has considered doing so.</p> <p>Regarding the decision to block Fauci from appearing in Congress, a White House spokesman, Judd Deere, said: \u201cWhile the Trump administration continues its whole-of-government response to Covid-19, including safely opening up America again and expediting vaccine development, it is counterproductive to have the very individuals involved in those efforts appearing at congressional hearings.</p> <p>\u201cWe are committed to working with Congress to offer testimony at the appropriate time.\u201d</p> <p>An unnamed senior administration official<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/05/01/congress-fauci-coronavirus/\"> told the Washington Post</a> the White House was \u201cnot muzzling\u201d Fauci, because he is expected at a Senate hearing about testing the following week.</p> <p>Thomas Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), will be among speakers at a House hearing next week.</p> <p>Late on Friday, the White House moved to replace a health department official who warned of supply shortages and testing delays at hospitals, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/us/politics/trump-health-department-watchdog.html?smid=tw-share\">according to the New York Times</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a> criticized the official, Christi Grimm, at a briefing three weeks ago, in response to the report she authored. Trump also attacked Grimm on Twitter, highlighting her work in the Obama administration. She also served under George W Bush and Bill Clinton.</p> <p>The White House announced Friday night that it had nominated a new inspector general for the department. Grimm would be the fourth government watchdog pushed out in recent weeks.</p> <p>In a statement, Patty Murray, a Democratic senator from Washington state, said: \u201cWe all know the president hasn\u2019t told people the truth about this virus or his administration\u2019s response, and late last night, he moved to silence an independent government official who did.</p> <p>\u201cThe president cannot be above oversight, no matter how he denies, attacks, and fights against it.\u201d</p> <p>On Twitter on Saturday morning, Trump insisted it was safe for the Senate to return to the Capitol.</p> <p>\u201cThere is tremendous CoronaVirus testing capacity in Washington for the Senators returning to Capital [sic] Hill on Monday,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>The Times, however, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/us/politics/coronavirus-testing-senate-white-house.html\">reported</a> that the office of the Congress doctor, Dr Brian Monahan, did not think it could test all 100 senators.</p> <p>\u201cLikewise the House, which should return but isn\u2019t because of Crazy Nancy P[elosi],\u201d Trump added. The House speaker has said members should not return next week \u2013 in response to guidance from Monahan.</p> <p>Nearly 200 members of Congress are more vulnerable to serious complications from a Covid-19 infection because they are 65 and older. Pelosi herself is 80. It is unknown how many are also at-risk because of underlying conditions or who live with people who would be at greater risk if they contracted the illness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/trump-lie-kayleigh-mcenany-press-secretary-coronavrius-michael-flynn\">Trump 'cannot tell a lie' \u2013 but can Kayleigh McEnany, his new press secretary?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe 5 minute Abbott Test will be used,\u201d Trump wrote.

  "<p>The chancellor Rishi Sunak is under intense pressure this weekend to offer a massive \u201csecond wave\u201d of financial support to businesses within weeks amid growing fears of a catastrophic early summer of spiralling unemployment and company bankruptcies.</p> <p>With the government\u2019s \u00a340bn job-retention scheme running until the end of June, business groups and the Labour party are demanding that Sunak extend the scheme as a matter of urgency to give an essential lifeline to the UK economy.</p> <p>Under the scheme \u2013 known as furloughing \u2013 the government covers 80% of the wages of workers who are staying at home and not working at all, up to a cap of \u00a32,500 a month. So far an estimated 140,000 UK companies have opted to furlough a total of around 4 million staff.</p> <p>But large and small employers have warned the Treasury that they will need to notify the government of widescale redundancies over the next fortnight if it fails to give details soon of subsidies it will offer beyond June.</p> <p>Last night The Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) said that pulling the plug on the furlough subsidy too early, before the lockdown had been lifted substantially, risked a return to unemployment rates not seen since the 1930s.</p> <p>Alan Lockey, head of the RSA\u2019s Future of Work Centre, said: \u201cThere is an estimated 27% of the entire workforce on furlough, with more than 80% of workers in the hospitality sector affected. If those people were made redundant the level of unemployment would rocket to levels not seen since the Great Depression\u201d.</p> <p>Tej Parikh, chief economist at The Institute of Directors, said that the government should try to avoid a cliff-edge moment where support ended suddenly: \u201cGetting the economy running again won\u2019t be like flicking a switch. Even if lockdown measures were completely lifted, many firms wouldn\u2019t expect demand to lift to normal levels immediately.</p> <p>\u201cA sharp removal of the furlough scheme at the end of June could cause significant problems for some businesses, so the government should explore how it could taper off the system in a flexible way.\u201d</p> <p>Writing in today\u2019s <em>Observer</em>, the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, calls on Sunak to do more. \u201cThousands of businesses face an existential threat, with risks to hundreds of thousands of their workers and the very fabric of our high streets and communities,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>\u201cEssential public health measures must be accompanied by economic help. The government must act urgently with a second wave of support, including, where necessary, an extension of the furlough scheme \u2013 with greater flexibility to enable part-time working \u2013 and it must look again at the gaps in current schemes.\u201d</p> <p>Miliband also says that companies that pay dividends to shareholders should not be eligible for state support. \u201cIf you\u2019re a large multinational and plan to pay dividends to your shareholders while claiming government resources, you clearly don\u2019t need them. Every pound that goes to them is a pound denied to an SME [small or medium-sized enterprise] for whom it can make the difference between survival or going to the wall.\u201d</p> <p>EasyJet paid \u00a3171m in dividends to shareholders last month while negotiating a \u00a3600m loan from the Treasury and the Bank of England\u2019s emergency coronavirus fund. The airline\u2019s founder and biggest shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, received \u00a360m of the dividend payout.</p> <p>Meanwhile Tesco paid a \u00a3635m dividend while accepting a similar-sized tax break from the government\u2019s emergency coronavirus support package.</p> <p>Companies in the hard-hit hospitality sector have put more than 80% of their employees on the furlough scheme, while the average for the private sector is 27%.</p> <p>Treasury sources said last night that the issue of extending the furlough scheme beyond June was under review. It is in talks with business groups to allow companies to claim support for staff returning to work part-time to prevent a \u201ccliff-edge decision\u201d that would otherwise force companies to make a choice between reinstating employees or make them redundant.</p> <p>Make UK, the manufacturers\u2019 trade body, has warned that firms would struggle to bring factories back to full capacity without a more flexible scheme that allowed for part-time working to be subsidised.</p> <p>Government officials are, however, cautious about extending subsidies beyond June following calculations by the Office for Budget Responsibility showing that the cost will exceed \u00a3100bn this year.</p> <p>The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said that the Treasury rescue schemes and extra spending by other departments were likely to send borrowing this year to in excess of \u00a3200bn, pushing the annual spending deficit above 10%.</p> <p>In an open letter to the prime minister, Boris Johnson, the president of the British Chambers of Commerce, Ruby McGregor-Smith said: \u201cBeginning with the chancellor\u2019s budget in March, Her Majesty\u2019s government has acted at speed and scale to deliver cash to firms on the ground through loans, grants and the job retention scheme. Government must ensure these schemes continue to evolve to support a phased restart of the economy, enabling businesses to survive through this crisis and thrive in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson is expected to announce an outline strategy for lifting the lockdown late this weekend. Downing Street sources said that the priority would be getting as many businesses back to work safely, but only when the number of new Covid-19 cases had fallen substantially from its present level. They denied reports that the two-metre physical distancing rule could soon be relaxed. However, new measures to force people entering Britain to go into quarantine for two weeks are likely to be announced soon.</p>",
  "<p>In 2018, NK Jemisin became the first writer ever to win three consecutive Hugo best novel awards for science fiction and fantasy. Her first award had been in 2016, for her novel <em>The Fifth Season</em>, and its two sequels,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/11/hugo-awards-2017-nk-jemisin-repeats-best-novel-win-the-obelisk\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/11/hugo-awards-2017-nk-jemisin-repeats-best-novel-win-the-obelisk\">The Obelisk Gate</a></em> and <em>The Stone Sky</em>, won in the following years. Yet speaking on the phone from her home in coronavirus-hit Brooklyn, Jemisin says she never thought she\u2019d be published. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think I had a chance. You just didn\u2019t see characters like me in fiction,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Growing up in Mobile, Alabama and New York, Jemisin was an avid reader, making up her own stories from the age of eight, but the lack of black women writing science fiction and fantasy, the genre she loved, made her believe it wasn\u2019t for her. \u201cWe were all exposed to nothing but white dude fiction, occasionally young white women fiction, and if that\u2019s how you\u2019ve grown up, then that is what is normal.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We were all exposed to nothing but white dude fiction and if that\u2019s how you\u2019ve grown up, then that is what is normal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Occasionally black characters would make their way into those stories written by white men. Jemisin recalls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/arthurcclarke\">Arthur C Clarke</a>\u2019s <em>Childhood\u2019s End</em>, in which Jan Rodricks, a black man, is the last human on Earth. \u201cThere\u2019s a paragraph when the black male character is introduced where Clarke pauses the story to basically explain to the audience that, you know, this character is black, but it doesn\u2019t really matter anymore in the future. And so for all intents and purposes, he\u2019s basically a white guy who just happens to have black skin. Not really the ideal way to handle it.\u201d She discovered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/mar/16/guardianobituaries.bookscomment\">Octavia Butler</a> in the 80s, and that \u201chelped a great deal, but she was one person\u201d.</p> <p>Jemisin trained as a psychologist and worked in universities, in a branch of counselling psychology specific to late adolescents. She carried on writing but gave up on any idea of publishing \u2013 she\u2019d been to graduate school, she had student loans, it didn\u2019t make sense to change careers. Then she hit 30, and had a \u201cmini midlife crisis\u201d. She\u2019d written a novel \u2013 an early take on what would become <em>The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms</em> \u2013 and sent it out to publishers, also taking science fiction and fantasy writing workshop<a href=\"https://viableparadise.com/\"> Viable Paradise</a>, where she gave short stories a try for the first time, and began selling her work. The novel didn\u2019t get picked up, \u201cprobably because it wasn\u2019t very good\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"40addcd99c614081b76632b392dcaf4a85a029bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40addcd99c614081b76632b392dcaf4a85a029bd/0_186_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Childhood\u2019s End (2015).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The last human on Earth in the 2015 TV adaptation of Arthur C Clarke\u2019s Childhood\u2019s End.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Narelle Portanier/Weed Road/Universal Cable Prods/Michael De Luca Prods/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She wrote another, <em>The Killing Moon</em>, which got her an agent. Set in a world based on ancient Egypt, it had an almost exclusively black cast \u2013 and didn\u2019t find her a publisher. \u201cIt was the mid 2000s, and at that time science fiction and fantasy publishers were not super interested in stories with black casts by black writers. They had done some stories with black casts by white writers, but they were not interested in those stories coming from people who actually were black.\u201d Rejection letters would say things like, \u201cwe like this, but we\u2019re not sure how to market it. We like this but we\u2019re not sure who its audience would be\u201d\u2013 the implication from publishers being \u201cthat fantasy readers don\u2019t want to read about black people. Black people don\u2019t want to read fantasy. So what do we do?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"67b3def28055b157bb729269596d95d667e53ddd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67b3def28055b157bb729269596d95d667e53ddd/0_0_191_293/191.jpg\" alt=\"The Killing Moon\" width=\"191\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Jemisin decided to rewrite <em>The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms</em>, making nearly the entire cast white. \u201cAll of them were horrible people. They\u2019d shank each other for, like, nothing. And I wrote this angry story about this lone brown girl going into this place full of mean white people,\u201d she says. It went to auction, with three different publishers fighting over it. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, this is what you want?\u201d she says. \u201cI was pretty bitter \u2026 I\u2019d taken such care in [<em>The Killing Moon</em>] to include sympathetic white people, but that wasn\u2019t what they wanted.\u201d</p> <p>Telling of Yeine Darr, an outcast from the barbarian north who is summoned to the city of Sky, where she is named one of the potential heirs to the king (whose family has enslaved the gods), <em>The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms</em> won Jemisin the Locus award for best first novel in 2011. Two more novels in the Inheritance trilogy followed in an astonishingly prolific 18 months. The books were selling steadily, if not meteorically, and her publishers were hungry for more: luckily, she had held on to <em>The Killing Moon</em>. Set in the ancient city-state of Gujaareh, where the Gatherers\u2019 role is to harvest the magic of sleeping minds to use it for good, until the dreamers start dying, it was nominated for a Nebula award.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A Nasa-sponsored workshop for writers about astronomy and her fascination with volcanoes fed into The Fifth Season</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By now Jemisin was back in her day job as a counsellor. She had a dream, of \u201can angry woman coming towards me with a mountain floating behind her\u201d. It gelled with ideas she\u2019d had since going on a Nasa-sponsored workshop for writers about astronomy, and she began to write <em>The Fifth Season</em>. Taking place on a planet with \u201cone vast, unbroken continent\u201d, the earthquake-racked Stillness, the novel opens with the \u201cend of the world\u201d as one man \u2013 a despised and enslaved \u201corogene\u201d, who can manipulate the earth \u2013 tears a great rift through the heart of the world. Jemisin has said in the past that \u201cit\u2019s pretty obvious that I\u2019m drawing on the human history of structural oppression, as well as my feelings about this moment in American history\u201d. It won Jemisin astonishing plaudits, as well as a deal for a television series. Accepting her third Hugo, she told her audience in <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fantasy/read-n-k-jemisins-historic-hugo-speech/?st=AFF&amp;SID=Barnes+%26+Noble+-+Top+100%3A+Book+Bestsellers&amp;2sid=Skimlinks_7598037_NA&amp;sourceId=AFFSkimlinks&amp;cjevent=371dc90271fe11ea802101ed0a18050c&amp;dpid=tekz25v83\">a winner\u2019s speech that went viral</a>: \u201cThis has been a hard year, hasn\u2019t it? A hard few years. A hard century. For some of us, things have always been hard.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bc99f7ae231b07e7d2bfcb6d153c2728f1cdf576\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc99f7ae231b07e7d2bfcb6d153c2728f1cdf576/0_0_327_499/327.jpg\" alt=\"The City we Became\" width=\"327\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Writing the trilogy while working almost full time hadn\u2019t been easy, particularly as Jemisin\u2019s mother had fallen ill in 2015. In the middle of writing the third book, she decided to launch a<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/nkjemisin\"> Patreon</a>, an online subscriber platform, to fund her work. She didn\u2019t have high hopes, but \u201cI got a lot more money than I was expecting, so I went ahead and quit the day job\u201d .</p> <p>That was 2016. After a number of years in which a group of writers \u2013 mostly male, white, and overwhelmingly rightwing \u2013 attempted to thwart the increasing diversity of the Hugos by block voting for their approved titles, Jemisin\u2019s triple whammy felt like a turning of the tide. As she put it in her blistering winner\u2019s speech: \u201cThis is the year in which I get to smile at all of those naysayers \u2013 every single mediocre insecure wannabe who fixes their mouth to suggest that I do not belong on this stage, that people like me cannot possibly have earned such an honour, that when they win it it\u2019s meritocracy but when we win it it\u2019s \u2018identity politics\u2019 \u2013\u2026 I get to smile at those people, and lift a massive, shining, rocket-shaped middle finger in their direction.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s gone on to raise that middle finger at them in her writing. The enemy in her new novel, <em>The City We Became</em>, is a huge, tentacled, Lovecraftian horror, an evil out to destroy cities. But this villain is no homage to the master of eldritch horror. In Jemisin\u2019s story \u2013 \u201ca glorious fantasy,\u201d says Neil Gaiman \u2013 the greatest of cities become living entities. New York has just awoken, and a \u201cbeast from the deeps\u201d is out to take it down. \u201cWhen you experience walking through any city at the right time, when the light is right, and it feels like it\u2019s you and the city communing. I wanted to put some words to that feeling, as artists do, and that\u2019s what I came up with,\u201d says Jemisin.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you read HP Lovecraft books like The Horror at Red Hook he\u2019s blatant about the racism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>HP Lovecraft, she says, also wanted to put words to a feeling: the feeling he had, however, was a vicious xenophobia. \u201cWhen you read things like <em>The Horror at Red Hook</em> he\u2019s blatant both about the racism and the fact that the racism is the inspiration for his feeling that these people are evil.\u201d Until 2015, a bust of Lovecraft was given to winners of the World Fantasy awards. This changed when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/11/nnedi-okorafor-books-that-made-me\">Nnedi Okorafor</a> won the best novel prize in 2011 \u2013 the first black person to win it since its inception in 1975. \u201cShe received the award and was like, do you understand exactly what Lovecraft represents to someone like me?\u201d says Jemisin. \u201cThere\u2019s a sort of running thread in science fiction to \u2018engage with the art and not the artist\u2019, probably because so many science fiction writers are problematic people. But in Lovecraft\u2019s case doing that is not just egregious but dishonest, because Lovecraft\u2019s fiction is so rooted in his xenophobia.\u201d</p> <p>The evil in <em>The City We Became</em> is, Jemisin has said, \u201cbasically Cthulhu\u201d (Lovecraft\u2019s octopoid monster), with a group of diverse characters facing off against it \u2013 and against, pointedly, the man-bunned alt-right trolls it recruits to fight for it. \u201cI was choosing to engage with Lovecraft\u2019s fear of the city \u2013 his sense that these diverse people brought a bad energy to it,\u201d she says. \u201cMy take was: of course they bring an energy to the city, all people do. He perceived it as evil, but really it\u2019s just life.\u201d</p> <p>Does she feel that Lovecraft, and the tentacles of racism that have wound through science fiction and fantasy for decades, are vanquished these days? It\u2019s around 15 years, after all, since <em>The Killing Moon</em> was rejected across the board. Perhaps a little, she says. Editors and publishers are now aware of the demand for inclusive, representative fiction, but \u2013 <a href=\"https://blog.leeandlow.com/2020/01/28/2019diversitybaselinesurvey/\">as a recent survey highlighted</a> \u2013 US publishing is still blindingly white in terms of staffing. \u201cAnd so there\u2019s a strange and nasty tendency that\u2019s developed for publishers to be perfectly OK with novels about certain groups of people written by white folks, but not written by members of that group,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s still easier for a white person to write a book with an all-black cast set in fantasy Africa and get it published than for a black person.\u201d</p> <p>Still, with her clutch of Hugos, Jemisin is having the last laugh. Looking back on that record-breaking night in 2018 she says, \u201cThere are detractors in the science fiction community who feel that was an inappropriate speech to make. They are welcome to that opinion,\u201d she tells me, with extreme dryness. \u201cI felt like I needed a little catharsis.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The City We Became by NK Jemisin is published by Orbit (\u00a316.99).
