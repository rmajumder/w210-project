  "The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, today defended the under-fire chancellor, Gordon Brown, and insisted Labour was \"in good heart\". <p>He argued the government and Mr Brown had a good track record on pensions and was working hard to improve further the situation for the elderly. Speaking at the party's annual conference in Brighton, Mr Prescott also defended the chancellor's approach, saying his strategy had been to first target financial help on the poorest pensioners who had seen the gap between their incomes and those of better-off pensioners widen during the Tory years. </p> <p>He said the government, having dealt with that priority, was now turning its attention to seeing what could be done to help slightly better off pensioners. </p> <p>\"The only real advances come for pensioners under a Labour government, that is a matter of record and history...we won't let them down. The chancellor is doing a good job,\" said Mr Prescott. </p> <p>The government has come under increasing fire in recent weeks for raising pensions by only 75p a week, and for not looking fully into restoring the link with pensions and earnings. </p> <p>Mr Prescott pointed out that although this year's increase in the basic state pension was only 75p a week, pensioners had also benefited from additional types of aid including winter fuel payments, free TV licences and the Minimum Income Guarantee. </p> <p>On fuel duties, Mr Prescott insisted the government would not be dictated to by the demonstrators. But he argued ministers had taken note of concerns about high fuel prices. He pointed out the government had reduced taxation on lorries and ditched the fuel duty escalator introduced by the previous Tory government. </p> <p>\"That is a Government listening and acting - you can't argue we are not listening,\" said Mr Prescott. </p> <p>He also went on to dismiss suggestions cabinet members were at odds over the strategy on pensions and fuel. \"Of course we are not feuding,\" he said, \"we are a very united cabinet that is clearly very proud of three years of delivery.\" </p> <p>He said the whole point of the Labour conference was to work through disagreements on policies, but morale was high. </p> <p>\"The party is in good heart and it is wanting and looking forward to the next General Election,\" he concluded.</p>",
  "<p>A novelist once claimed that the hardest aspect of fiction was deciding which jobs to give your characters. Few writers have been on proper payrolls, which is why so many central characters tend to be journalists or novelists. In television, except for series where the job is the plot - the cop, doc, vet and teacher shows - people tend to be vaguely \"in business\" or doing something unspecified in sales or accounts. </p> <p>So long after the Industrial Revolution, writers never expected to be given an entire new profession to deal with - until the internet. The sharp and promising new drama Attachments (Tuesday, 9pm, BBC2) is set among young people setting up a website ). It's no surprise to find this series getting here so quickly, because its creator Tony Garnett made This Life. Many people would have set a yuppie drama among ad executives, but the genius of This Life was to realise the undercurrents of class, sex and deceit to be found in the legal profession. </p> <p>Attachments, on the evidence of an opening episode from This Life writer Richard Zajdli, is similarly impressive in the way that the professional setting remains relevant to the look and feel of the series. Sex and love may be a major theme - as the email pun in the title gives away (the series was at one point called Click) - but the internet is never simply the background metaphor and CV-dressing that it is, for example, in the new David Hare stage play My Zinc Bed. </p> <p>In Attachments, important plot twists result from web cameras and email and, as the lawyers in This Life carried their professional lying and power games into their private lives, so the excitability and fickleness of these characters results partly from working in one of the few professions in which days of work can vanish by hitting the wrong switch. Attachments does a good job, in part because of its unusual sensitivity to work.</p>"
