  "<p>Innogy, the electricity generation and supply company formed out of the demerger of National Power, is tipped to be heading the race to buy Independent Energy (IE), which collapsed into receivership on Friday. </p> <p>Sources close to Innogy said the company was interested in IE's energy supply business, which has 242,000 domestic and small business customers, and would be approaching receiver KPMG. </p> <p>KPMG said it had received expressions of interest from two potential bidders for the Solihull company, which employs 160 people. </p> <p>Other UK players tipped by analysts to look carefully at IE include generator and supplier Powergen and nuclear operator British Energy, which also has supply customers. Another City favourite, Scottish and Southern Energy, said it was not interested. </p> <p>An approach from a US player or Europeans such as EdF or RWE was also mooted. </p> <p>The KPMG receivers Roger Oldfield and Myles Halley said they were taking the business on as a going concern and expected to sell it in 'weeks rather than months'. </p> <p>IE shares were suspended on Friday at 500p, valuing the company at around \u00a3200 million. It ran into trouble with its billing systems, which meant it was unable to retrieve \u00a3119m owed by customers. </p> <p>In June chief executive John Sulley announced that IE had enough funds to last until its credit facility expired at the end of this month, and that he had secured longer-term financing. He also said he would accept an offer for the business. </p> <p>IE's shares reached a high of 3750p in March this year - valuing the business at \u00a31.5 billion. Any buyer is likely to demand a significant discount to Friday's closing price. However, one analyst said: 'The fundamentals of the business are sound. They had a nightmare with their billing system, and simply ran out of time to fix it.'</p>"
