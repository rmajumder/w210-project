  "<p>Barely have our Olympic team stepped off the plane and already someone is taking a pin to the bubble of national pride we have from the Sydney games. According to a report out this week, British workers should be given a medal of their own - for being among the most miserable in the world. </p> <p>In a survey of more than 200 international businesspeople, just 25% of Britons said they were happy at work, compared with 54% of Americans. Furthermore, while more than 80% of the Australian and French respondents - and 100% of the Americans - cited their home among the top countries in the world in which to work, only 38% of Britons did so. And in the overall vote on the most miserable country in which to work, Britain took bronze, coming third after China and Japan. </p> <p>The list of statistics goes on, with British workers consistently rating our western working counterparts as having more blessed working lives than us. It is a damning indictment of our own job market, but one which is hardly surprising when you scour the lengthy list of complaints that arise out of the way we work. We may be used to working the longest and most insecure days in Europe, but the message of this research is clear: we don't have to like it. </p> <p>Carolyn Asome, who used to teach in France, can relate to the research. Recalling her days there with fondness, she says: \"Over there the working conditions are so much better. The hours are shorter, the job security is stronger and there are really good state benefits - if you don't earn over a certain amount you get a great rebate for your rent,\" she says. \"All the time I was there, unions were fighting for better conditions. They were really successful, but the irony is the conditions are far worse over here.\" </p> <p>Likewise, Clare Macfarlane, an advertising account executive, enjoyed the relaxing year she spent working in Australia. \"There was a definite mass exodus from the office at five o'clock every day, and it's certainly not like that over here,\" she says. Even the managing director took a relaxed approach to the company commitments: \"He was definitely more interested in what he was doing at the weekend. But that could be to do with the quality of life in Australia. They definitely get their priorities right.\" </p> <p>Ben Williams, an Edinburgh-based chartered corporate psychologist, preaches a similar relaxed attitude. \"We have to try to have more fun at work,\" he says. \"I spend most of my professional career optimising the performance of people at work, and one of the things that does that best is a willingness to play, share and enjoy. It is something workers in this country really have yet to master.\" </p> <p>Part of the problem with Britain is that our priorities are all over the place. As work dominates our lives, we become more and more subservient by the day. The confrontations between unions and managements are long gone, and in their place sits a drained, clock-watching workforce which does nothing but moan. As Williams puts it: \"We're much less positive about things. We have a less can-do attitude than some of the other parts of the world where they make things happen.\" </p> <p>In France, where unions have fought for high levels of job security, generous state pensions and high levels of company-funded insurance, workers can, of course, afford to be happier. </p> <p>Yet, as in our resignation to the death of union strength and workers' rights, there is a very British defeatism in denouncing ourselves as one of the western world's worst places to work. Given the chance in the survey, other nationalities rated us highly as a good place to earn a crust. It may well be an outsider's misconception, but Professor Cary Cooper, the occupational psychologist who analysed the research, believes the foreigner takes the correct standpoint. He puts Britain's poor performance in the league table of happy workers down as more of a reflection of the British psyche than of poor working culture. </p> <p> 'We have a very negative view of ourselves,\" says Cooper. \"British people always seem to put themselves down a lot more than other countries. In the same way the Americans show their arrogance by unanimously saying they hail from one of the world's top three places to work, so we British show our self-effacing and demure side by constantly labelling ourselves a national failure.\" </p> <p>It is a conclusion that Williams is equally quick to draw from the findings. \"You can't change the results of 150 years of British social and economic history, and that history has taught us that it pays to keep your place and be humble,\" he says. \"We have a natural reserve about us and a kind of enforced inferiority complex which keeps us down and in our place. That is the reason we find the Americans and Australians and all the Brits who went overseas to form the New World as being very cocky, arrogant and pushy.\" </p> <p>So, work-wise, we conform to our national stereotypes - the arrogant Americans meet the diffident Brits. Yet the stigma is acceptable only because we manufactured it. It is a national habit to malign our own assets and habits but, of course, completely unacceptable to hear anyone else make a similar slur. The British workforce should rest assured: the moment another country labels us a nation of miseryguts there will be a scramble to defend ourselves. </p> <p><strong>Work in Britain: the foreign view</strong></p> <p><strong> The recruitment agency worker:</strong><br> For the past nine months Sarah Kinney, from Canada, has worked for S&amp;G Recruitment in London. She believes employment is very different here. \"There seems to be a lot more paper shuffling and shifting here, and more middle management, more invented jobs. The whole attitude to work is different - people work hard all week and play hard at the weekend. In Vancouver, everyone's very laid-back.\" Originally Sarah wanted to work with children, but she found it didn't pay enough. </p> <p><strong> The brand marketing manager:</strong><br> Originally from Italy, Christina Fedi has also worked in Paris. She is now employed by Channel 4, and prefers having a job in the UK: \"There are more media jobs available, and it is easier to change jobs or be a freelancer,\" she says. One difficulty she has encountered is excessive politeness: \"People are not very confrontational at work. If you want to express an opinion you have to package it in a nice way, listen to what they say and then say 'I understand what you're saying, but...' It becomes a very lengthy process.\" </p> <p><strong> The academic: </strong><br> American-born Steve Greenwold, the deputy head of Birmingham University's school of social sciences, cannot imagine ever working anywhere but the UK. \"Maybe people here are less well paid compared to the rich Germans and Americans, but they're funny, amusing and cooperative,\" he says. \"And the work ethic is strong; it's very strong in America, but it's equally strong here, and I don't think that's a source of grumpiness. My experience is that people who are in jobs that are fulfilling seem content with their lot.\" </p> <p><strong> The trainee lawyer:</strong><br> Zohar Zik, from Israel, works for a firm of solicitors in London. After completing a degree at Cardiff law school he started his legal training last October. He too prefers working in London: \"I feel much more comfortable in London - plus there are better job prospects for me here as an Israeli graduate from a British university. There are better working conditions here in terms of hours and pay; I still have to work a long day, but I am paid more than I was in Israel. The hours are incredibly long there and the pay is very low. This is not the only reason I chose to stay here, but it is a significant factor.\" </p> <p><strong> The management consultant:</strong><br> Ilan leshem, from Germany, has worked in London for two-and-a-half years. He says: \"Germany has nicer, more modern offices, but that's not so important to me. The bonuses you get in the City of London are incomparable with elsewhere, but salaries at the lower end of the market definitely aren't as good here. One big difference is holiday entitlement. In Germany you can expect to get about 30 days' holiday, as opposed to 20. You also get more national days off. Having said that, there are other perks, like getting a day in lieu if I have to work a weekend.\"</p>"
