  "<p><strong> World Snowboarding Guide 2001 by Tony Brown (Ice Publishing, \u00a311.95)</strong> </p> <p>This is a guide for those after snowboarding advice with attitude. The writing is cocky and colloquial. Information is frank and straightforward, but although it does assess conditions for beginners, the book is aimed at a young set of serious thrill-seekers. An excellent quick reference panel of mountain, snow and travel data accompanies the write-up of each resort. Advice on safety, job-finding and top tips from riders complete what is an impressive guide, but prepare for a good dose of snowboarding 'cool'. </p> <p><strong>Time Out Guide: New Orleans (Penguin, \u00a310.99)</strong></p> <p>The party spirit of 'The Big Easy' has found its way into this high-spirited and snappy second-edition guide. Written with a clear love for the city, it engrosses you with tales of New Orleans's colourful history, arts scene and Mardi Gras festival. Steering you away from tourist traps, 'top tens' help you sort through the sights, music venues and shops. Sections cover every angle of city life, with suggestions for children, as well as advice for disabled visitors. And if the fun gets too much, simply take a trip out of town.</p>"
