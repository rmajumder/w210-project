  "<p>New figures showing unemployment at a 20-year low and an easing in wage inflation were seized upon by ministers last night desperate to switch attention from the mounting crisis over fuel and the debacle of the millennium dome. </p> <p>In a double piece of good economic news, the office for national statistics announced that unemployment had fallen to a 20-year low while tight pay deals are keeping wage inflation firmly under control.</p> <p>The number of people out of work and claiming benefit last month fell by 18,000 to stand at 1,051,300, while the proportion of the workforce claiming benefit has fallen to 3.6%, its lowest since October 1975.</p> <p>Employment minister Tessa Jowell hailed the figures as adding to the government's \"sustained record of achievement\" while the TUC general secretary John Monks said the figures were \"excellent news\" and showed that full employment was now attainable.</p> <p>The claimant count has fallen by an average of nearly 20,000 a month since June, according to the ONS, raising hopes among Labour strate gists that it will fall below the key 1m level by Christmas.</p> <p>On the government's preferred measure on unemployment, based on the labour force survey, the number of people looking for work has also declined. The internationally comparable rate of unemployment fell to 5.3% in the three months to July, from the 5.7% of the previous three months.</p> <p>The tightening labour market does not appear to be sparking wage inflation. The ONS said average earnings increased by 3.9% in the year to July, a fall from the 4.1% rate recorded the previous month. The last time earnings were rising this slowly was August 1996 when the annual rate was 3.7%.</p> <p>Economists said the subdued earnings figures strengthened the chances that interest rates would be kept on hold.</p>",
  "<p>It's the sort of scenario apologists for two divisions must have dreamt about. With one round of matches to go, six sides are in with more than just a mathematical chance of promotion from the lower echelon of the County Championship. Northamptonshire are already there, but Glamorgan in second are just seven points clear of Gloucestershire in seventh - almost the entire division is still in with a sniff. </p> <p>The concept of dead matches, which under the old one-divisional system used to begin around late-July, has gone the way of the aluminium bat, the eight-ball over and blackwashes by West Indies.</p> <p> No matter that the first division is virtually done and dusted (Surrey need one point to clinch the title, and Kent need one to condemn Hampshire to the drop - along with Derbyshire and Durham). The new system has been utterly vindicated by the second-division dog-fight that makes every game matter.</p> <p>So who's going to join Northants? Here's a guide to the final four matches of a county season that has peaked later than any other can ever have done.</p> <p><strong>Essex</strong> (3rd, 150 pts) v <strong> Warwickshire </strong> (6th, 144 pts)</p> <p>Essex need 17 points to be certain of promotion - that's a win plus five bonus points. A draw plus a full quota of bonus points (eight) might be enough too, but Essex won't want to take that risk. And on a pitch where their last two first-innings scores have been 136 and 131 it's unlikely they'll be able to. Particularly as Warwickshire will be going all out for the win they need to give them an outside chance of going up. Can Allan Donald stand any more disappointment after the NatWest Final washout?</p> <p><strong> Glamorgan </strong> (2nd, 150 pts) v <strong> Middlesex </strong> (9th, 127 pts)</p> <p>Of the six teams in the chasing pack, Glamorgan appear to have the easiest path to first-division status: Middlesex are the only side in action who can't be promoted (Sussex, who have already completed their fixture-list, will be in Division Two next season too). Like Essex, Glamorgan need 17 points to make sure, while a draw would leave them dependent on other results. But they've won just one match at Cardiff all season, and any side led by Justin Langer won't want to take the wooden spoon back to Lord's. Even so, pride should be no match for the Dragons' burning desire.</p> <p><strong> Gloucestershire </strong> (7th, 143 pts) v <strong> Nottinghamshire </strong> (4th, 147 pts)</p> <p>Gloucester have probably left it too late to show they can play games that last longer than 100 overs: promotion would require them to score 400 in their first innings (something they haven't done all season), then win, then hope that two of Glamorgan, Essex and Worcestershire don't. Notts' hope of emerging from the doldrums depend on winning well and either Essex or Glamorgan slipping up. </p> <p><strong> Worcestershire </strong> (5th, 144 pts) v <strong> Northamptonshire </strong> (1st, 180 pts)</p> <p>Worcestershire are playing the runaway leaders, but this is no bad thing. Northants' season in effect ended when they lifted the trophy after their draw with Essex, and if they're not hungover, they could be demob-happy. The seaming wickets at New Road aren't the best place for them to execute their usual game-plan of batting first, racking up 450 and unleashing Jason Brown's offspin. Worcestershire on the other hand will have Glenn McGrath - who rarely fails on the big occasion - but even a big win for Worcester would still leave them waiting on the other results.</p> <p><strong> Predictions </strong> Glamorgan to finish second after beating Middlesex, and Nottinghamshire to finish third after they beat Gloucestershire and Essex lose to Warwickshire.</p> <p><em>Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com.

  "<p>When covering the BBC, hacks learn to look carefully for major announcements timed to coincide with national emergencies. Today's is a classic. After months of speculation over his future, Peter Salmon's fate has finally been announced. Weeks after the national press unilaterally crowned Lorraine Heggessey his successor, Salmon goes but there is no replacement named. </p> <p>In the rush now to express sympathy for the man who spawned a thousand fish-related headlines, no one, it seems, wishes Peter Salmon ill. It's a mark of how well he is liked that even as he quits BBC1, the BBC has gone to such efforts to pitch his move to director of sport as a promotion. And to be fair to him, he had to be something of a jack of all trades. </p> <p>The fiasco created by Birt's broadcast/production split put tremendous pressure on the channel controllers which is only now beginning to be undone. Even now, it seems that one of the stumbling blocks to a new controller is the position of drama commissioning. The job, which is key to BBC1's success, remains vacant as those offered it are said not to want the mish-mash available. </p> <p>Salmon's torrid time in what Media Guardian recently described as the hardest job in television, has been characterised by one of the worst periods in the BBC's history. It can't have been much fun running the channel as it plunged to record ratings lows, and though shows like Walking with Dinosaurs and the Royle Family are cited as his triumphs, there are numerous television figures who have better claims to having discovered those hits. </p> <p>From the haemorrhaging of BBC Sport, to the masturbation gags on Christmas Day, from the Queen Mother's birthday pageant to the loss of Des Lynam and Vanessagate, Salmon has indeed had it hard. But none of these would be sufficient to dislodge a truly secure controller. </p> <p>What really suggests Salmon's departure from BBC1 is involuntary is the memory of last year's Edinburgh TV Festival. In the midst of a revolution at the corporation just after Greg Dyke's appointment as director general designate, Salmon made a stirring plea for an extra \u00a3100m annually to be spent on his channel. We cannot produce the drama needed to anchor BBC1 on the money available, he said. Now, 12 months later, just as the money is on the table to be spent, Salmon is moved on. </p> <p>He had to go, his position became untenable. But it's easy to see why the BBC might feel it owes him.</p>",
  "<p>Celltech, Britain's biggest biotech company, yesterday moved into the black for the first time but saw its shares dive 5% as analysts branded its interim results \"uninspiring\". </p> <p>The Slough-based group, which recently entered the FTSE 100 index, made profits of \u00a310.7m before exceptional items, largely owing to its acquisition of drugs firm Medeva in January. </p> <p>Finance director Peter Allen said: \"These profits are a first for us but we're rather cautious about life. We view them as just a start.\" </p> <p>By buying Medeva, Celltech added a sales network and a portfolio of mature drugs to its portfolio of emerging products. However, Medeva operating profits fell slightly during the period to \u00a325.7m, owing to declining sales of its top three drugs. </p> <p>Mr Allen said the fall was due to Celltech's policy of encouraging customers to keep lower stocks of the key drugs - methylphenidate for attention deficit disorder, Tussionex for flu and heart drug Zaroxolyn. </p> <p>The figures were accompanied by the unexpected departure of Garry Watts, the former finance director of Medeva who was retained after the takeover to continue running the business. Mr Allen said: \"We wanted somebody with more of a pharmaceutical background than an accounting background.\" </p> <p>Initial sales of Mylotarg, the recently launched drug for leukaemia, reached $3.8m. But analysts were disappointed by a modest contribution from Chirocaine, the group's new anaesthetic. Mr Allen admitted that it would take time to establish, saying: \"Anaesthetists are a relatively conservative bunch.\" </p> <p>There was also concern at the size of a \u00a3349m goodwill charge on the purchase of Medeva. Eva Haas of Old Mutual Securities said: \"I'm mildly disappointed with the results. Some people might say that the size of this goodwill charge means they rather drastically overpaid for Medeva.\" </p> <p>Celltech's shares closed down 77p at \u00a344.20. Steve McGarry of Goldman Sachs said: \"There's nothing really here to excite the market.\"</p>",
  "The human race is set to vanish from the earth much sooner than it would naturally as a result of its destruction of other species and use of fossil fuels, a leading investigator into the history of extinction predicted yesterday. <p>Michael Boulter, professor of palaeobiology at the University of East London, told the British Association that without a catastrophic event such as the comet or asteroid strike which killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, mammals as a group could have expected to live for hundreds of millions of years before fading from the evolutionary scene. </p> <p>But the rate at which humankind has made other mammal species extinct since the end of the last Ice Age, argues Prof Boulter, amounts to the beginning of a catastrophic event in its own right. </p> <p>\"Humans are adding to the pace of the present mass extinction which will involve all large mammals and many other groups. We will be one of the extinguished species. The good news is that life on the planet will recover and peace will return to the environment.\" </p> <p>Prof Boulter and his group have produced a mathematical model of how groups of living organisms emerge, peak and become extinct. Typically, groups of animals diversify into multiple species rapidly, then slowly decline into extinction.This fits in with the records of fossils. </p> <p>But the recent rate - recent in geological terms, at least of large mammal extinctions was more typical of the sudden mass extinctions which have occurred five times in the earth's past. </p> <p>The two key periods in humankind's contribution to the extinction of the mammals were its hunting activities in the aftermath of the Ice Age and its recent use of fossil fuels. Asked whether humankind's unique ability to influence its destiny could be turned to save itself, Prof Boulter said: \"Look at the news. There's anger over the high price of fossil fuels. Cutting back on fossil fuels is the one thing human beings must do to stop extinction happening, but they won't do it, will they?\"</p>"
