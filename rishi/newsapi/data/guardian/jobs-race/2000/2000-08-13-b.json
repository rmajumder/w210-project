  "Was Jay Gatsby, one of the most celebrated figures in twentieth-century literature, a black man in code? <p>The theory that the social climber, playboy and wheeler-dealer, played in a screen version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel by Robert Redford, was essentially black has been made in a paper by a US academic, Dr Carlyle V. Thompson. </p> <p>He sees in The Great Gatsby Fitzgerald's deep-seated apprehensions about miscegenation between blacks and whites. He also suggests that the rebellious author was playing a trick on his conservative publishers, Charles Scribner's Sons, who five years earlier published The Rising Tide of Colour: Against White World-Supremacy by the eugenicist Lothrop Stoddard. In the novel, Tom Buchanan is reading this book, though it is incorrectly entitled, The Rise of the Coloured Empires. </p> <p>'The overwhelming characterisations of Gatsby are black,' claims Thompson, an assistant professor in the department of literature, languages and philosophy at Brooklyn's Medgar Evers College. Gatsby is unfathomably wealthy. He gives swell parties, but no one comes to his funeral. 'He's a bootlegger,' says one guest. </p> <p>'Bootleg means counterfeit - and Gatsby is racially counterfeit,' says Thompson. 'And racial passing was at a peak when the book was published.' Thompson insists the text is brimming with evidence that Gatsby is black. </p> <p>'How do you explain all of these things - his brown body, his tanned skin, his close-cropped hair? These are signifiers of racial passing.' </p> <p>Then there's Gatsby's house: 'He's got 40 acres and a mansion. That speaks towards the legacy of slavery in America. All slaves were supposed to get 40 acres and a mule.' </p> <p>Thompson sees Gatsby's link to Montenegro, where he was awarded a medal for heroism, as a symbol. 'It means black mountain. Is Fitzgerald calling Gatsby a black mountain?' </p> <p>Professor Matthew Bruccoli, one of America's leading Fitzgerald scholars, says the theory is nonsense. 'Saying that Gatsby is black is utterly implausible. It turns the teaching of literature into a silly game.'</p>",
  "Marcel Tafen plans to run for mayor in the Russian provincial town of Tver under the campaign slogan 'He is different'. This is to state the obvious: in a town with a population of almost half a million, Tafen, from Cameroon, is one of a few dozen black inhabitants. <p>Although he has spent nine years in the community halfway down the Volga river between Moscow and St Petersburg, his presence is still considered so unusual that people in the street persist in following him with their gaze as he walks past. </p> <p>But Tafen, 28, believes that ultimately the colour of his skin will not harm his chances of being elected in October - so far his novelty value has brought only good publicity. Nevertheless, he anticipates that the campaign could turn dirty. 'I know already that some people aren't going to vote for me simply because of the way I look - so I am prepared for all eventualities,' he said. A qualified doctor, Tafen arrived in Tver from Cameroon to study medicine when he was 19. He planned to return home as soon as he was qualified, but his burgeoning political career prompted him to change his mind. </p> <p>Now he is hoping that officials will grant him Russian citizenship in time for him to register for the mayoral race. </p> <p>Tafen will not be focusing on race issues during his campaign or, were he to win, in his role as mayor. Instead, his programme concentrates on improving life for the town's youth. He promises to highlight issues ranging from drug abuse to unemployment and Aids. The town has one of the highest incidences of Aids in Russia. A stand-up comic who frequently appears on local television, Tafen also heads the Tver Hip-Hoppers, a local dance club, and is a keen basketball player. </p> <p>Russia's black community remains small and is still largely concentrated in big university towns - the result of a government programme developed in the late 1950s, which helped young people from communist-controlled Third World countries to travel to the Soviet Union to study. With the rise of neo-fascists and the growth of skinhead movements in Russia, black inhabitants have come under repeated attack - although the level of abuse has never equalled that meted out to people from the Central Asian states. </p> <p>Abdoul Kane, a student from Senegal and an anti-racism campaigner in Moscow, said he feared that Tafen's chances of becoming mayor of Tver were slim. </p> <p>'Xenophobia in Russia remains very strong. During the Soviet Union people here had very little information about what Africa was really like and this bred some extraordinary prejudices,' Kane said. 'Many people expressed surprise when they learnt that there were actually towns in Africa because they thought that everyone lived in mud huts. Some said they had heard that Africans came to Russia to have their tails removed. </p> <p>'Things are improving, but most of the 3,000-odd Africans now in Moscow have been verbally abused. A minority have also been physically attacked. I think that the opposition candidates in Tver will play heavily on the race issue to destroy his chances.'</p>"
