  "<p>Golf used to be one long fashion comedy act, all diamond jumpers and garish socks, but this winter there are few hipper places to be seen than honing your handicap on the golf course. Ever since fashion central sent out the orders that argyle was in, nouveau riche was chic and gloves were gorgeous, there was only one game to turn to. </p> <p>There has always been an element of the catwalk about the amble between holes. Golf, don't you know, is the ideal way to close deals, so dressing your best is part of the game. Luxury labels have long been seen on the greens (luxurious not always being stylish) and it was Prada who blew new life into the sartorial side of the game by producing a sleek range of fairway fashion in 98. Now, though, we're more likely to be coveting our competitors' Scotch House cashmere or Burberry pullover.And it's no longer discreet chic that impresses - where else but on the 18th hole would you get away with a pink gingham visor?</p>"
