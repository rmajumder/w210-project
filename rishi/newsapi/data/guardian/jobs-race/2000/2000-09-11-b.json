  "<p>Two defeats into yet another black September for Wolves and any shred of pre-season optimism has all but dissipated. </p> <p>Old Gold shirts may still be de rigueur on the terraces - though most are without number or name now that Keane and Bull are gone - but the air of resignation from the lowest league crowd for seven years was all too evident as their patched-up side trudged off at the final whistle. </p> <p>Colin Lee's squad has been ravaged by injuries and with the Saudi Arabian Sami Al Jaber still awaiting international clearance, the Wolves manager gave a league debut to Adam Proudlock, recently recalled from a successful loan spell at Clyde and given a three-year deal into the bargain. </p> <p>The promising 19-year-old should have quickly justified his manager's faith only to drag a shot narrowly wide from 10 yards. And though Carl Robinson soon made amends with a neat header, a spirited Tranmere fought back from one down for the third time in a week to record their third win. </p> <p>Wayne Allison headed in directly from a free-kick and the substitute Stuart Barlow left his shirt on while celebrating his winner from the penalty spot, which at least spared Stephen Lodge the dilemma of whether or not to book him. </p> <p>\"We are missing a lot of very good players but the crowd stuck with us,\" said Lee. \"I think they understood the difficulties we are facing. We are trying to pick up points here and there until we get the players back.\" </p> <p>Lee is giving priority to recruiting a central defender to help shore up the backline but will have to do without his captain Kevin Muscat for one match - sent off for upending Sean Flynn in conceding the penalty - and for the season without Scott Taylor, after rupturing a tendon in a kneecap. </p> <p>Tranmere had lost their previous seven games here, the last win coming in 1993 when Sir Jack Hayward was building Wolves a stadium fit for the Premiership and only two stands were complete. For Lee, the third manager to try to satisfy \"Golden Tit's\" ambitions since, the future looks rocky.</p>",
  "<p>The Jerusalem Post, one of the world's most famous newspapers, has been put up for sale for at least $80m (\u00a356m) by Conrad Black's Hollinger International, the owner of the Daily Telegraph. </p> <p>Investment bank Morgan Stanley's New York office is conducting an auction of the title which has a loyal following among Jewish communities worldwide. More than three-quarters of the hits on the Jerusalem Post's popular jpost.com website come from the United States. </p> <p>The auction comes a month after Mr Black sold the bulk of his Canadian newspapers and magazines to CanWest Global Communications, Canada's third largest television network, for \u00a31.6bn. </p> <p>Mr Black has owned the Jerusalem Post since 1990, during which time he has shifted its political allegiance from the left to the right of Israeli politics. It has also developed links with The Wall Street Journal and successfully embraced the internet. </p> <p>Jpost.com has become one of the most visited newspaper websites and is a potentially lucrative source of e-commerce and advertising revenues. </p> <p>Several bidders are thought to have held talks with Morgan Stanley including Michael Sinclair, publisher of the London Jewish News, though it is thought his offer of about $20m was turned down. Mr Black is believed to be prepared to hold on to the title until the right offer emerges. </p> <p>The Post's readership, made up of immigrants from English-speaking countries and an older generation of Israelis of Central European extraction who never entirely mastered Hebrew, remains static and is believed to stand at under 30,000. Since 1998, the Post has been challenged by the liberal Ha'aretz newspaper which launched an eight-page English language edition as an insert in the International Herald Tribune. </p> <p>Many of the Post's readers drifted to Ha'aretz though the paper has solid support from orthodox English-speaking immigrants who support its rightwing policies. </p> <p>Mr Black first bought into the Telegraph Group in 1985 when he took a 15% stake and the group under Lord Hartwell was struggling. Within six months he had control of the newspapers. Four years later they were making a profit. </p> <p>Last year the Hollinger group had revenues of $2.1bn (\u00a31.3bn) and had an operating profit of just under $213m. </p> <p><strong>Parsimonious publisher turned deaf ear to breaking news</strong></p> <p>The defining moment of the Hollinger era of ownership of the Jerusalem Post arrived with the outbreak of the Gulf war in 1991, writes Suzanne Goldenberg in Jerusalem.</p> <p>The news that American missiles had landed on Iraq broke at 2am local time but the publisher refused to pay the printers overtime so the Post was the sole Israeli paper not to cover the attack on the night. </p> <p>Such cost-cutting zeal, and a marked shift to the right, have eroded the reputation of the Post since Conrad Black acquired it in 1989. Within months, the takeover prompted the walkout of 29 of the Post's most seasoned journalists in a protest against editorial interference. </p> <p>Many saw the walkout as the beginning of the end for the Post. Founded in 1932, the paper over the decades had managed to transcend its status as a small town newspaper by virture of its location in a country that is a news treadmill. It earned an international reputation for thoroughness and reliability, and for tolerating a wide range of opinion. </p> <p>That changed when Hollinger came into the picture. The intifada, the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories that erupted in 1987, sharpened focus on the management's move of the paper to the right of Israeli politics. Since the election last year of a more liberal prime minister, Ehud Barak, the Post has shifted back towards the centre, in response to the changing realities in Israel. </p> <p>However, the Post relies heavily on foreign news agencies reporting Israeli politics and diplomacy, running the material unattributed under the bylines of its poorly paid and largely young staff.</p>",
  "<p>NBC will break all the records when it comes to the Sydney Olympics. The biggest, the longest, the most expensive coverage in history . . . The statistics trip off the corporate tongue as only Americans know how. Yes, they're promising more than 3,000 staff broadcasting a record 441 hours to an estimated 230m American viewers. And yet not one second of the games will be shown live on TV. </p> <p>Nothing to do with time zone differences, the apparent explanation is that neither their viewers nor their advertisers want to watch everything as it happens. </p> <p>This may seem remarkable given that NBC has paid \u00a31,000m (another record of course) for the rights to Sydney and the 2000 Winter games, effectively bankrolling the entire Olympics organisation. </p> <p>However, the broadcasting giant is confident of its games plan. Chairman of NBC Sports, Dick Ebersol, says that the network made a major error during the Atlanta Games in 1996 when it mixed live and pre-recorded elements, leaving viewers dazed and confused about what was going on. Similar complaints bedevilled CBS's coverage of the Nagano Winter games. </p> <p>The overwhelming complaint from journalists, athletes and tourists at Atlanta, however, was that NBC abandoned its live coverage when there were no home competitors in with a medal chance and instead showed taped packages of US triumphs. For the Sydney 2000 games, American viewers may be spared the sight of foreigners winning anything. </p> <p>But for NBC it's not really about winning or losing at all: \"The majority of people who tune into the Olympics come to watch the stories, not the results,\" Ebersol claims. </p> <p>At a crucial three-day gathering of 350 key staff in Salt Lake City over the summer producers and reporters were instructed on how to capture viewers' hearts and minds by focusing on the human dimension. One example shown looked at Australian swimming star Ian Thorpe's relationship with a 13-year-old who has cancer. </p> <p>But it is a road fraught with danger. Another clip showed a woman runner falling down with the commentator speculating that she had obviously burst an ovarian cyst. Not quite what NBC has in mind. </p> <p>Nevertheless female concerns are a big issue. Or as Ebersol puts it: \"There's a different audience for the Olympics [which is] one of the last real family event shows in our country. \"You can't do it with straight sports reporting. Every time it's been done that way, it's failed\" </p> <p>What NBC would really like is more of the sports that their viewers like to watch. Back in 1994, senior executive Peter Diamond, a member of the International Olympic Committee's television commission, admitted: \"I'd like the IOC to find a way to have another day, or two, or three of artistic gymnastics.\" He was also keen on more swimming, figure skating and other events with bodily appeal. </p> <p>Since signing an unprecedented, five-Olympics deal with NBC for the exclusive US rights back in 1995, the IOC has seen fit to introduce synchronised swimming and beach volleyball as official events. Wet T-shirt contests can only be a matter of time. </p> <p>One event that American viewers love - and in fact the only one that is being shown \"as live\" on TV (four hours later at 8pm primetime) - is the opening ceremony. Drama, breath-taking beauty and entertainment and all designed for television - and that's just the opening shot. </p> <p>When broadcasters from around the world first converged on the spectacular site for the 2000 games they were unanimous that the views would provide them with the shots of a lifetime. But NBC's Ebersol thought Sydney could do better. </p> <p>He envisaged an opening shot which could frame the Harbour bridge and the stunning skyline of north Sydney while effortlessly tilting through to the lip of the roof of the stadium itself (the biggest in Olympic history, need I say it?) and down into the flaming cauldron. </p> <p>A broadcasting tower the height of the stadium itself was quickly agreed to, but more problematic was Ebersol's request that all the city's power lines \"blocking\" the view should be pulled down and re-routed. </p> <p>Eventually, after great controversy, Australia's Olympics minister Michael Knight made the reputedly $7m decision to acquiesce to what the press dubbed \"Dick's vision\"- and the taxpayers are still footing the bill. </p> <p>It is a perfect illustration of the power and influence of NBC over the Olympics movement. So much so that Ebersol, a personal friend of Juan Antonio Samaranch, IOC President since the 70s, acts as if he were an official spokesman of the Olympics rather than a representative of one local broadcaster. </p> <p>Ebersol arrived in Sydney last week on the first of 28 specially-chartered NBC 747s, mostly reserved for advertisers, to deliver a presidential-style speech praising the work of local Olympic organisers while attacking the Australian media. \"Almost everything I can think of about these games has been perfect except for the PR, and 90% of that I rack up to the bizarre nature of your tabloid press,\" he said. </p> <p>In this he was perfectly echoing the views of Samaranch who has always been concerned about the Australian media's refusal to ignore the stories that have haunted the IOC in recent years. Facing a grilling from a British journalist at a press conference in Lausanne, Samaranch typically brazened it out, until finally snapping: \"Are you from Australia?\" </p> <p>Indeed Sydney's organising committee has found it tough to work in the gaze of a free and independent press - making every decision from the siting of the stadium (on a disused abattoir) to the price of the meat pies inside it a source of continuous discussion, dispute and ridicule. </p> <p>Attempts to make the city fit for the world's media have been tracked and exposed at every turn. While Atlanta got away with bussing out the city's homeless well in advance, Sydney's more subtle decision to floodlight many of the areas where the city's homeless regularly sleep has been widely publicised. </p> <p>And most of all, the media has been preoccupied with what will happen at the opening ceremony - after the cameras have panned through outer space, and the Statue of Liberty, that is. </p> <p>After months of secrecy, rumour and the odd leak, little has been revealed, except that Olivia Newton John will return from two decades of Californian exile to sing. The press reaction has not been encouraging. Presumably NBC is happy to have one of their own presiding. </p> <p>Ever since the much-maligned announcement that there would be three official mascots, Sydney's organisers appear tormented by the desire to please and appease every section of the community - from the city's hip and exotic crowd to the rural backwaters and the aboriginal community. </p> <p>And the final piece in this chaotic jigsaw appeared with the announcement a fortnight ago that the closing ceremony would feature a Mardi Gras-style drag queen display. So, that's the gay and lesbian community sorted. </p> <p>Amid the outcry from the outback, there were reports that American affiliates and advertisers were demanding the scenes be excised from their TV screens. (Presumably to make way for highlights of US gold medal triumphs). </p> <p>But Olympic officials were quick-ish to explain. By the following day the drag queens had become a homage to the film Priscilla Queen of the Desert as the entire closing ceremony was to be a celebration of great (sic) Australian movies from Crocodile Dundee to Babe. </p> <p>I guess to be fair, though, the final word must go to NBC: the ultimate compliment to the host city. \"You've built all the facilities magnificently, you got them there early, you've tested them and Sydney will get more coverage than any other off-shore Olympic city,\" says Ebersol. Let the cameras roll.</p>"
