  "<p>It is becoming increasingly difficult to define precisely what a football manager is for, apart from slagging off referees and doing Marcel Marceau impressions in his little rectangle of rage by the touchline. </p> <p>Surely Chelsea have blown the gaff in appointing not a manager to succeed Gianluca Vialli but a head coach. Even more than Vialli did, Claudio Ranieri will leave the management side of things to the board and the backroom staff. His job is simply to produce a team capable of getting Chelsea back on to the gravy train of the Champions League. </p> <p>At least Chelsea have reverted to giving the job someone with a wide knowledge of running football teams. Ruud Gullit and Vialli were excellent players but neither had experience of dealing with the contrasting, often polyglot personalities that make up the modern dressing room, and with both this proved a fateful flaw. </p> <p>As for league titles, whatever happens at Old Trafford this morning, Ranieri will doubtless realise eventually that the winning of championships is simply not in the genes of his new employers. </p> <p>Chelsea are the light opera of English football, always have been and always will be. Giving a seriously qualified Italian the job is akin to making Beniamino Gigli the lead tenor in the Gondoliers. For Chelsea Village read the town of Titipu. </p> <p>Never mind, it should be fun while it lasts. And at least Ranieri knows his place in the Stamford Bridge scheme of things. Elsewhere the roles of the men who are still called \"manager\" are becoming confused. </p> <p>At an increasing number of clubs, the manager may pick the team but the plc calls the real tune. His position in the transfer market, already weakened by the Bosman ruling, is now threatened by the possibility that, if the European Commission gets its way, the transfer system may soon disappear altogether. </p> <p>Increasingly those clandestine meetings with prospective signings in Post Houses just off the M6 belong to a vanished age. Agreeing to buy a player for a certain fee has become little more than a declaration of intent. Negotiating a player's salary and bonuses, with agents, chief executives, wives, fathers and mothers-in-law all having their say is when the business really begins. </p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson is the most successful manager in modern British football, one of the nearest things the game still has to a manager in the old sense. In team matters, Fergie's writ runs large through the corridors of Old Trafford just as Sir Matt Busby's once did. </p> <p>He has a presence even when he is not present, like Brian Clough at Derby County and Nottingham Forest, Bill Shankly at Liverpool, Don Revie at Leeds United, Bill Nicholson at Tottenham and Stan Cullis at Wolves. Yet even Ferguson's powers are limited on the business side of things and he cannot sign whom he likes when he likes for as much as he likes. </p> <p>The old-time managerial figures are gradually fading away. Ron Atkinson talks much sense about football in the media and John Bond is always good for a word or two about the game but it is 20 years since this pair were archetypical, larger-than-life figures strutting their stuff at the Manchesters United and City. </p> <p>How many modern football managers are really managers by the old definition? Few if any. </p> <p>Herbert Chapman, who brought honours and glory to Arsenal in the early 30s, was an impresario; more of a showman than a football technician. At that time clubs tended to have secretary-managers, men responsible for the paper work as well as pinning up the weekly team sheet. Alf Ramsey was among the last of these before he left Ipswich to become England manager in 1962. </p> <p>The last time managers held maximum power over their players was in the days of the retain-and-transfer system when at the end of each season clubs would publish a list of those they wished to keep and those who were to be let go. </p> <p>It was an antiquated and iniquitous practice which allowed Charlie Mitten, then the manager of Newcastle United, to describe George Eastham as having \"long pockets and short arms\" when the player refused to re-sign at St James' Park because he wanted to join Arsenal. </p> <p>Eastham and his case are a crucial part of the players' struggle to win freedom of contract and work for whom they please. The managers, however, are now threatened with a situation likely to rob them of the last vestiges of the control over team-building which they once had. </p> <p>Already subject to the whims, fancies and migratory habits of a growing army of players of assorted nationalities, the manager has become a cog in the machine rather than the man who presses the button. </p> <p>His type may still exist in the personalities of managers such as Ferguson, Jim Smith at Derby, George Graham at Tottenham and Harry Redknapp at West Ham. But the future lies with the super-coaches - Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, G\u00e9rard Houllier, Peter Taylor and Glenn Hoddle - and the gentle days when a Tony Waddington could scrounge around for good players just past their peak and sign them up to give Stoke City a team worth watching are long gone. </p> <p>Then again, looking at all the thirtysomethings Ranieri has at Chelsea, maybe not.</p>"
