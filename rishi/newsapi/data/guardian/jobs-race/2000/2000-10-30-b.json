  "Bill Clinton waded into the closest US presidential race in decades for the first time yesterday, pleading with voters to stop George W Bush capturing the White House for the Republicans a week tomorrow. <p>While Al Gore campaigned in Michigan, which has emerged as the number one battleground state in the neck-and-neck November 7 contest, the president climbed into a church pulpit to urge black Americans to get out the vote for the Democratic candidate. </p> <p>\"I am pleading with you. I've done everything I know to turn this country around, to pull this country together, to move us forward. </p> <p>\"I have done everything I know to do,\" Mr Clinton told worshippers at the Shiloh Baptist church in Washington. </p> <p>\"We still have bridges to cross. We still have dreams to build for our children. The choices are stark and clear and will have great consequences,\" he added. </p> <p>\"So talk to your friends, talk to your neighbours, talk to your family members, talk to your co-workers and make sure nobody takes a pass on November 7. Learn, decide and choose.\" </p> <p>But as Mr Clinton prepared to hit the campaign trail later this week in California and the south, where he will concentrate on energising black voters and other minorities, the Gore camp made it clear that it intend to keep the president at arm's length in the main electoral battleground, win or lose. </p> <p>\"I appreciate that he's out there, but I think the fact is that Bill Clinton's name is not on the ballot,\" Mr Gore's running mate, Senator Joe Lieberman, said yesterday. </p> <p>\"The people are going to be voting for Al Gore and me, or George Bush and Dick Cheney.\" </p> <p>\"We're not looking for any help here. Al Gore is his own man,\" the deputy campaign director, Mark Fabiani, said. </p> <p>With just eight days to go to election day, Mr Bush remained ahead in all the national opinion polls, whose margins ranged from one to seven points in a kaleidoscope of different surveys. </p> <p>He led Mr Gore 49% to 42% in the latest Gallup tracking survey, which posted a 13-point Bush lead on Friday. In the latest Washington Post tracking poll, by contrast, Mr Bush was ahead of Mr Gore by 47% to 46%. </p> <p>The uncertainty of the outcome in the contest was underlined by a clutch of new polls in the battleground states which gave Mr Gore a narrow overall advantage, foreshadowing the possibility that the vice-president may lose in the popular vote next week but win enough electoral college votes in the states to capture the White House. </p> <p>Polls in nine battleground states by the Zogby organisation for Reuters/MSNBC showed Mr Gore ahead by five points in Florida, by six in Wisconsin and by seven in Illinois. He led by four points in Missouri and two in Washington state. </p> <p>Mr Bush led by 11 points in Mr Gore's home state of Tennessee, by three in Ohio and by seven in Pennsylvania, where he previously trailed in most polls. The two men were dead level in Michigan. </p> <p>Of the 153 electoral college votes up for grabs in the nine states, Mr Gore would win 80 on the basis of these polls, and Mr Bush take 55, leaving Michigan's 18 still undecided. That would put Mr Gore narrowly ahead in the battle for the 270 electoral college votes needed for victory. </p> <p>While Mr Bush continues to look and act like the favourite, announcing plans yesterday to concentrate his campaign this week in states which Mr Clinton carried in 1996, Mr Gore won the most prestigious of an avalanche of weekend newspaper endorsements when the New York Times gave him its support in an editorial headed simply \"Al Gore for president\". </p> <p>\"We firmly endorse Al Gore as the man best equipped for the presidency by virtue of his knowledge of government, his experience at the top levels of federal and diplomatic decision-making, and his devotion to the general welfare,\" the Times wrote. </p> <p>Of Mr Bush, the paper said his qualifications were \"too thin for the nation to bet on his growing into the kind of leader he claims already to be\". America's prosperity and achievements \"could be undone in a flash by a pliable and inexperienced president driven by a highly ideological Congress,\" it warned.</p>"
