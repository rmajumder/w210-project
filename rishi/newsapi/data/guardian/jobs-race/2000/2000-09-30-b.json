  "<p>The train is deserted. I can sit where I want and even spread out the papers and cuttings I intend to read on the way. My trip to the office has never been more pleasant. But there is a very good reason for this - it is not yet 6am. Having spent most of the night thinking about work rather than sleeping, I am cutting my losses and going in. </p> <p>That was a few years ago and I have changed my working practices and attitudes a lot since. At the time I would have said I had no choice as I was overworked, but I still remember the buzz I felt sitting on that empty train. That feeling, when I analysed it later, disturbed me. Was I becoming a work addict? </p> <p>Could this apply to you? </p> <p>The phrase 'work addiction' was not in our vocabularies when I made that trip to Waterloo, but there appears to be a lot of it about now. A survey conducted by the Institute for Personnel and Development shows that more than a million workers in Britain consider themselves 'addicted' to their jobs and voluntarily work extra hours. A third of these self-diagnosed addicts were self-employed. </p> <p>Adrian Cole is senior addiction therapist at the Priory Clinic, Bristol, and regularly treats work addicts. 'Addiction is a pathological relationship with an object or event, which means it can happen in any job,' he says. 'Although we see more men than women, it's not related to occupation or to how high up the ladder you are - we see the full range, from managing directors to technicians.' The clinic uses a 40-point questionnaire to assess a patient's degree of addiction. </p> <p>How many of the million in the IPD survey would be diagnosed as addicts by Cole? Perhaps more than you think. 'Work addiction is becoming more prevalent at the clinic,' he says, 'and like any other drug, it can, if pursued to its conclusion, be fatal. In Japan, 10 per cent of male deaths are work-related.' </p> <p>Addiction often manifests itself in long hours. In the IPD research, one in three of the people working more than 48 hours a week - the threshold under the Working Time Regulations - said they were addicted. But, says Cole, you don't need to be working all hours to be hooked. 'You may be working nine to five - but if all the time you're at home watching TV you're actually thinking about work, you need to think about what that means. We also see binge working, like binge drinking.' </p> <p>Comparisons with alcohol addiction go further. The Priory's treatment programme uses the first four of the famous 12 steps used by Alcoholics Anonymous. However, there is an important difference. 'Unlike alcohol addiction, we're not asking work addicts to give it up completely,' says Cole. 'That's not possible. The idea is to regain a healthy relationship with work. But while the act of not drinking may be difficult, the idea itself is simple. The ideas around work are more complex.' </p> <p>At the Priory, work addicts are admitted as either inpatients or outpatients to the treatment programme - four to five weeks of group sessions, videos and written work, including keeping a diary. 'Most people don't work while they are on the programme,' says Cole. 'But once they leave, some go back full-time, others part-time. Some retire. About 70 per cent will experience better lives as a result.' </p> <p>Cole believes all of us are potential addicts. 'Everyone likes to change the way they feel,' he says. 'When we find something that works for us, we go back to it. For some, it gets out of control. The point is that, initially, addiction works.' </p> <p>Work addiction is particularly insidious in this way. For a time it brings praise, promotion and higher pay. 'At first, work addiction is beneficial to the individual, their family, their company and society,' says Cole. 'But as returns diminish, addicts will strive even harder to chase that rainbow - even when deep down inside they know it isn't working.' </p> <p>Perfectionism, a need to be in control, low self-esteem and a preference for working alone rather than in teams are the classic character traits in work addicts. Cole is keen not to blame modern working culture - 'addicts use whatever is around; it's not new'. But when working practices exacerbate those characteristics, it is a cause for concern. </p> <p>Long hours, less job security and performance-related pay all make addiction easier to hide or to rationalise. Last year's Joseph Rowntree study, which showed that job insecurity had increased, also found a high correlation between poor general health and job insecurity. </p> <p>Nick Isles of the IPD says businesses gain nothing from overwork. 'When they work long hours, workers make mistakes and their relationships suffer,' he says. 'Businesses are realising that and we're seeing a backlash against the long-hours culture and presenteeism [being there to match or outdo colleagues' hours]. It's about working smarter, not longer.' </p> <p>Cole agrees. 'We have more and more companies coming here for seminars in healthy working. Work addicts are unproductive: no company wants that.' </p> <p>But Isles has a worry for the future: 'It's difficult to get the healthy working message over to self-employed people who love what they're doing.' 'Look at dotcom companies, for example.' This will be the IPD's next area of research, Isles says. </p> <p>But can you get addicted to addiction research? </p> <p>\u0095 There are 13 Priory hospitals in the UK. They take NHS and private patients and offer a free initial assessment to anyone who thinks they may be addicted. Call 0117 952 5255 for details. </p> <p><strong>Awkward questions to ask yourself</strong></p> <p> Do I regularly do any of the following things? </p> <p> \u0095 Get impatient in slow-moving queues </p> <p> \u0095 Find myself doing two or three things at once, such as eating lunch and writing a memo </p> <p> \u0095 Tend to put myself under pressure with self-imposed deadlines </p> <p> \u0095 Get upset with myself for the smallest mistake </p> <p> \u0095 Prefer to do things myself rather than ask for help</p> <p>These are five out of 25 questions asked of potential addicts (chosen simply because they struck a chord with me). Score <strong> 1</strong> for never, <strong> 2</strong> for sometimes true, <strong> 3</strong> for often true and <strong> 4</strong> for always true.

  "<p>Long, long ago, in the dark, Tory-governed era known as the early nineties, this reporter made - shock! horror! - a mistake. Flattered by the attentions of a well-known publishing company, waist-deep in debt and desperate to escape the confines of her parental home, she took the first job she was offered. </p> <p>Reader, I hated it. I felt bored, underused and unstimulated. Worse, I realised that my plan - to move across to another part of the company - was unfeasible. I struggled on for ten months, then handed in my notice. A series of equally miserable jobs followed. Trapped in the wrong sector, I finally went freelance and slowly eased my way into the position I had always craved. </p> <p>Regret is futile and I learned a lot along the way, but I often wish that, as a new graduate, I'd waited until a more suitable position came along and saved myself years of frustration. </p> <p>You're probably a lot more clued up than I was - and the job market has become more flexible and graduate-friendly in the last few years - but I don't want you to repeat my mistake. So, before you sign your name on that first job contract, listen up. </p> <p>First, let's get something straight. There's nothing wrong with taking the first job you're offered, as long as it's the \"right\" job. And what with parental pressures (\"We're not supporting you anymore\", \"It's time you found your own place\" etc), the burden of student debts and the desire to join your peers on the career ladder, it's easy to make a first job mistake. There are many: joining a company where you don't fit in; realising the industry bores you; finding out you're trapped (for example, media sales is not a launch-pad into a career as a war correspondent); simply being unrealistic (you might have great ideas to turn round Marks &amp; Spencer's fortunes, but no-one will make you chairman straight out of college). </p> <p>It's obvious, but if you don't apply for the wrong first job, you won't be offered it. The trick, according to Imogen Daniels, adviser to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, is to do as much pre-application research as possible - and that requires a little navel-gazing. </p> <p>\"Do an MOT on yourself before you start applying and make it a continuous process,\" she suggests. \"Ask yourself why you're attracted by certain jobs, what your motivations are, why you're applying to particular organisations in certain industries? Do you want to earn lots of money? Are you prepared to work long hours at the cost of your social life? Will you really be happy in a large organisation or would you feel more at home in a small, intimate environment?\" </p> <p>Next, says Lawrence Wilson, director of careers and student development at Canterbury, Christchurch, thoroughly research the industry and organisations that attract you. Be realistic - some sectors, particularly creative ones, won't pay the average graduate starting-salary, so waiting for the perfect job with the perfect package may be a waste of time. Read up about your chosen sector and company, in newspapers and on the internet and, if possible, try to speak to people who know what the company culture is like.</p> <p>If you get a job interview, use it as an opportunity to observe the company's working environment, the dress-code and stress-levels. But, Lawrence admits, \"For many people, the only way to decide their suitability for a certain job or area is to do it. If you discover you've made a mistake, unless it's so bad that it's making you ill or destroying your confidence, you should give it at least six months so it looks credible on your CV. You won't be trapped in your first job for life - the 40 hours a week, 40 years with the company ethos has long gone - and downsizing has changed the concept of commitment and loyalty within society.\" </p> <p>So, should you take the first job you're offered? \"In general, it's better to be in employment than unemployed - not just from a financial point of view but from a psychological one,\" says Lawrence. </p> <p>\"Working gives you confidence and structure. You should avoid the shock of the dole queue at all costs. If you really can't find the job you want - or have no idea what you want to do - temp for a while, or even do voluntary work.\" </p> <p>One day, perhaps, they'll invent sophisticated computers which can take your genetic code and match it to the industry, company, role and workmates that are best suited to you. </p> <p>Until then, mistakes will continue to be made. But remember, even if you hate your new job with a passion, you'll learn a lot about yourself and the world of work... even if it's merely discovering what you don't want to do.</p>",
  "<p>Airtours, Britain's leading package holidays operator, yesterday laid itself open to a takeover after issuing a fresh profits warning on discovering a \u00a320m black hole in its newly acquired German subsidiary. </p> <p>Shares in the group lost 4.5p to 215.5p after it confirmed yesterday's Guardian report that it was about to issue a negative statement. </p> <p>Manchester-based Airtours said losses at its Frosch Touristik (FTi) business would be \u00a3100m this year, \u00a320m more than it had expected. The group as a whole is likely to make a loss of about \u00a310m. </p> <p>Airtours, which last year failed to take over British rival First Choice, has been in talks with German group C&amp;N about a merger but these are understood to have stalled. Observers said a bidder would have to offer 290p a share, valuing Airtours at \u00a31.42bn. </p> <p>Airtours which had paid \u00a330m for a 36% stake in FTi, Germany's fourth-largest holiday operator, assumed full ownership earlier this month for an extra \u00a325m. But Airtours executives were horrified to discover the previous management had entered into wildly ambitious programmes. </p> <p>\"The German market has been atrocious,\" said David Jardine, the group finance director. \"The Germans have caught the English disease of chronic the overcapacity of 1995 which was fixed a year later.\" </p> <p>Mr Jardine said FTi had bought up to 85% guaranteed hotel beds compared with an Airtours standard of 40-50% and had paid up to 30% higher. But, he said, two-thirds of these contracts had been renegotiated and the German firm's losses, at \u00a3100m this year, would be \u00a340m next year before break-even in 2002. </p> <p>David Crossland, Airtours chairman, who has been spending two days a week in Germany, said: \"We have addressed the specific commercial and structural problems and are encouraged by the future potential of the business.\" </p> <p>But Airtours, which shocked the market last month by announcing a 70% drop in pre-tax earnings in the third quarter to \u00a36.2m, will take \u00a350m of FTi's losses. </p> <p>The group has said its rationalisation programme will cost a further \u00a390m in exceptional charges while its e-commerce plans will knock up to \u00a315m off the bottom line, wiping out earlier expectations of a \u00a3120m pre-tax profit. </p> <p>The new programme includes a shift in the back offices of Airtours Holidays, high street operators Going Places and Travelworld from Woking to Rochdale and the loss of 450 jobs. But Mr Jardine said this would ensure a low-cost base and save \u00a38-10m this year. </p> <p>The group expects to make a net \u00a3235m profit from the sale of its stake in Italian cruise joint venture Costa Crociere for \u00a3350m, and analysts' forecasts are for pre-tax profits of \u00a3163m next year. Executives hope this will prevent a takeover. </p> <p>But industry sources said the news made Airtours open to a takeover in the consolidation which saw Preussag this year outbid C&amp;N and gain Thomson Travel for \u00a31.8bn.</p>",
  "When Clare Daniel slipped on the crown and sash to become the first Miss Wales of the new millennium, she hoped her new-found fame would pave the way for a glamorous media career. <p>But far from realising her dreams of becoming a television presenter, Miss Daniel, 20, has been forced to get by on a job in a fish and chip shop. She now plans to shatter the image of the beauty contest when she hands over her crown at next month's Miss Wales 2000 pageant. </p> <p>The beauty queen, from Swansea, intends to say in her parting speech that her year-long reign was a wasted opportunity. </p> <p>Miss Daniel claims she has not even received her prizes of a \u00a31,500 portfolio of professional photographs and make-up valued at \u00a3300, while she has run up credit card bills of almost \u00a33,000 to cover her travel expenses, clothes and make-up. </p> <p>\"I refuse to stand up and lie to people by telling them what a great year I have had as Miss Wales when in fact it has been terrible,\" she said. </p> <p>\"All I ever wanted to do was represent my country and put Wales on the map but I feel the whole year has been a wasted opportunity. </p> <p>\"The only work I have had in my capacity as Miss Wales is what has been generated through the media and that has all been for charity. Don't get me wrong, the experience was great. </p> <p>\"Everyone thinks winning the title is glamorous but it has just left me with huge credit card bills.\" </p> <p>Miss Daniel blames her lack of work on the organiser of the 1999 Miss Wales contest, who was assigned as her agent. </p> <p>The organiser refused to comment yesterday. He will not hold the franchise for this year's contest, which will be run by the Miss World organisers Eric and Julia Morley with a television company.</p>"
