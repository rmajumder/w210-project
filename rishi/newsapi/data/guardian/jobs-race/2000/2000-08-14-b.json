  "The Republican presidential candidate George W Bush said yesterday that he saw nothing improper in the weekend revelation that his running mate Dick Cheney has been given a \"retirement\" package worth $20m by the Texas oil multinational at which he has worked for less than five years. <p> The payment was agreed by the Dallas-based Halliburton Corporation on July 26, the same day that Mr Bush announced he had selected Mr Cheney. Had he resigned, clauses in his contract could have forced him to forfeit $10m or more in stock options and compensation. </p> <p>The news of Mr Cheney's latest windfall comes as details of the extent of the former US defence secretary's personal wealth from the oil business continued to emerge. It drew angry attacks from the Democrats. </p> <p>\"They'll turn the Oval Office into the Oil Office\", Al Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane, said yesterday, adding that the question was whether Mr Cheney's ties would affect US energy and foreign policy under a Republican administration. </p> <p>Mr Bush told the Los Angeles Times in an interview that he saw no reason for Mr Cheney, 59, to stay out of energy-related policy deliberations because of his ties to the industry. </p> <p>But he added: \"What I want him to do is not be owning oil stocks so he benefits from decisions we make in the administration. He'll follow the same rules I'll follow and that is we'll put all of our assets into blind trusts.\" </p> <p>Like Mr Bush, Mr Cheney has amassed great personal wealth from the oil industry. His salary at Halliburton, which he joined in 1995, was $2m a year, but he also owns or has options on more than 1m Halliburton shares, worth $51m at current market prices. In May, Mr Cheney sold 100,000 shares, at a $5m profit. </p> <p>Mr Cheney has made clear that he has no intention of selling his other shares unless he is elected in November. \"Why not? I'm not on the government roll yet, I have no control over policy,\" he said last Friday. </p> <p>Mr Cheney is also entitled to $2.1m in \"deferred compensation\", which earns 10% interest while it goes unclaimed. </p> <p>\"The American public should be pleased that they have a vice-presidential nominee who has been successful,\" Mr Bush's spokeswoman Karen Hughes said yesterday.</p>",
  "<p> It may be high summer, but the job market is not in a holiday mood, according to July figures in the report on jobs issued by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC). Though it has slowed, growth is still lively. In particular, demand for temps outstripped supply, pushing pay up at the fastest rate for two years. </p> <p>Now that temps enjoy statutory holiday pay and a ready supply of work, perhaps the traditional seasonal pressure has increased as more temps go off for a summer break themselves. </p> <p>A report from Warwick University provides a bigger picture of the job market over the next decade. Their Institute for Employment Research predicts 2.3m jobs will be created over the 1998-2009 period, and two-thirds of these will be taken by women. What's more, over that decade, 300,000 new managers will have to be found. </p> <p>But the report also shows how the pattern of work has changed. The workplace is far less hierarchical than it was a generation ago. Time management and decision-making have devolved down. As a result, there is far more need for interpersonal skills, such as the ability to negotiate. So when employers speak of skills shortages these are what they mean. This is especially true of the secretarial job market, where customer service experience usually tops the list of skills in short supply. The REC suggests that one of the brakes on growth continues to be the difficulty employers have in finding suitably qualified candidates. </p> <p>At the same time, the modern secretary is the model of the new worker. Having to cope with working for as many as 10 managers at a time naturally develops time management skills, assertiveness, and the ability to recognise priorities - albeit in a rather Darwinian fashion, because there is still very little training in these assets available to secretaries. All the same, the future promises to be an empowering experience.</p>"
