  "<p>So Steve Claridge's Portsmouth miracle continues. Three games, three goals, three wins reads his record as player-manager, and he is obviously perfecting the art of motivation. Two goals down and outplayed in the first half, his team in the end won easily. </p> <p>Both sides, looking for positive pre-match omens, could seek some solace in statistics. Portsmouth, with a 100 per cent record since Steve Claridge's appointment as manager, were the team in form. Palace, meanwhile, had lost their last four league games. </p> <p>But statistics cannot sustain either club, and both are struggling to haul themselves out of financial troughs. While Portsmouth have produced the results, Palace have been spending money - this week they signed Latvian winger Andrejs Rubins for \u00a32m, and Liverpool's Steve Staunton, whose transfer was free but whose wages are anything but. </p> <p>The home side had the better of a first half in which neither side excelled, and while both new signings played well, it was Tommy Black, a \u00a3500,000 summer purchase from Arsenal, who stood out. After half an hour he ended a good run by playing Morrison through, but the home-grown striker's shot was headed off the line by Michael Panopoulos. </p> <p>The deadlock was broken four minutes later when Black picked up the ball and took two steps forward before sending a fine shot into the top right corner from 20 yards. Five minutes later he scored again. Forssell this time was played through on the left, and when he screwed his shot across goal Black reached the loose ball first to tap into an empty net. </p> <p>In first-half stoppage time Portsmouth undeservedly pulled a goal back. Aleksandr Kolinko looked to have caught the ball but dropped it when Lee Bradbury appeared to shove him. Steve Claridge duly knocked in his third goal in as many games. </p> <p>So Palace spent half-time brooding over their misfortune, Portsmouth laughing at their luck. Certainly, the game was transformed as the second period began, and Pompey had their first period of dominance. Enjoying himself more than most was Ceri Hughes, a half-time substitute for injured captain Darren Moore, who, within 15 minutes, created the equaliser. </p> <p>Given room on the left to cross, Hughes picked out Thomas Thogersen, who rose unchallenged six yards from goal to leave Kolinko help less. It was, sadly, to be the highlight of Hughes' day, as 10 minutes later he sustained an injury and was replaced. </p> <p>Portsmouth knew the game was theirs for the taking, and with 10 minutes remaining they took it. Again the goal came from a left-wing cross, Nigel Quashie this time providing the service, and Mike Panopoulos meeting it with a mishit shot which bounced over Kolinko.</p>",
  "<p><strong>After an accident at work, I am being offered an office job rather than my old job out of doors. This is happening through a 'job swap' with someone who earns less than me.
