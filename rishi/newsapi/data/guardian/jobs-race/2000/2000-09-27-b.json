  "<p>The Brazil coach Wanderley Luxemburgo has been sacked because of the team's Olympic quarter-final defeat against Cameroon, regarded in Brazil as the most humiliating result since they lost 2-1 to Uruguay in the 1950 World Cup final. </p> <p>Luxemburgo's dismissal will be announced formally on Friday by the head of the Brazilian Football Confederation, Ricardo Teixeira. The announcement was leaked to leading sports reporters in Brazil's main newspapers yesterday and widely circulated on their websites. </p> <p>However, Luxemburgo, on his return to Sao Paulo last night, denied the story. \"I direct the team against Venezuela and up to the World Cup,\" he said. \"The World Cup project is still on.\" </p> <p>Brazil have taken the Olympics seriously - perhaps because it is the only major title that eludes them - but Luxemburgo was already under pressure because of a run of poor results in 2002 World Cup qualifiers, including defeats in Paraguay and Chile. He was also the subject of allegations of tax evasion, lying about his age throughout his career and that he chose weak players for the squad hoping to earn money from their raised value. </p> <p>His replacement is widely expected to be Luis Felipe Scolari, known as Big Phil, who is currently coaching the Belo Horizonte club Cruzeiro. Scolari, who took Palmeiras to the Intercontinental Cup final against Manchester United last year, is known for his combative style. Last night Scolari was refusing to comment. </p> <p>Luxemburgo, after a brief honeymoon with the press and fans who considered him a serious, modern coach when he took over from the folksy Mario Zagallo after Brazil's World Cup final defeat by France, soon became despised for having arrogant tiffs with Brazil's top players. He always wore suits - and, when it got cold, leather gloves and raincoats - which alienated him even more from the crowds. </p> <p>He chose to take only players under 23 to the Olympics - despite a campaign waged in the press to take Romario along as a \"guiding father\" as one of three permitted overaged players - which included two players from the main squad, Alex and Ronaldinho Gaucho. </p> <p>The World Cup qualifier in Venezuela is on October 8. It is currently unclear whether Scolari will take over immediately or in the new year but Teixeira is expected to confirm this in his announcement in Rio de Janeiro on Friday.</p>"
