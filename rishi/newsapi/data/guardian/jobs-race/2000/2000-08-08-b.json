  "<p>One Hallowe'en, I sat beside a witch as she ate clam chowder. In a flowing tie-dye dress, she told me how she'd been hounded out of the Navy, how she'd suffered for her hardly-black arts. (These are not the lyrics of a Joni Mitchell song but actual fact.) I was in Salem, Massachusetts and, in between tripping over the plastic pumpkin lanterns which lined the streets, went to lunch with this witch. Her name was Jolene. You'd think if you were a witch, the first thing you'd magic would be a nicer name. And, in her animated opposition to Salem's celebratory hoopla, she kept spilling her chowder on her tie-dye. While I was thinking of a non-spillage spell, she was sighing \"People died here. There is no reason to celebrate.\" <strong> Secrets Of The Dead</strong> (C4) sought to explain why the Puritan township of Salem started on its witch hunt in 1692 and did so most persuasively, coming up with a most surprising suspect: the bread. And all this time, I was thinking it was nasty Abigail. </p> <p>Bewitchment had been reported across Europe, from East Anglia to parts of south-east France and Germany, with the same symptoms recurring. Debilitating convulsions, the sensation of having insects crawling under the skin and terrible nightmarish visions were all attributed to the victim's bewitching at the hands of some village misfit who was then dutifully tortured/ hung/burned at the stake. While 40,000 \"witches\" were killed across Europe, the events in Salem are now the most notorious. </p> <p>But Dr Linnda Caporeal wasn't content to blame moral panic for the witch hunt. Having discovered that if the Puritans' rye crop had been infected with ergot fungus and the fungus had sneaked into the bread, those who consumed the bread would suffer what we would identify as bad acid trips, Caporeal was giddy with excitement. Ergot, we learned, was like naturally occurring LSD and as such, would induce symptoms otherwise attributable to bewitchment. </p> <p>With many an expert enlisted (including a fungal toxicologist named Maurice Moss) and the cross-referencing of bewitching events, weather and farming conditions, Secrets Of The Dead was more than plausible. Even with its high camp reconstructions of maidens writhing in beds with snakes and smoke machines and shpooky lights in fields, there couldn't have been a more conclusive case unless a written confession was extracted from the bread itself. </p> <p>But the programme became a victim of its overvaulting ambition, pointlessly linking the ergot poisonings in Salem to the Grauballe man. His peatbog-preserved stomach contents analysed, he was found to have ingested ergot and thus, we were told, had been horrifically murdered by his kinspeople who thought him possessed by a demon. Case closed. </p> <p>Ignoring the more plausible explanation that he was a human sacrifice, and was given ergot because his people knew it was hallucinogenic, and wanted him to open the gate in his mind to whatever otherworldly place they thought he was going, Secrets Of The Dead severely damaged its credibility. </p> <p>It would be easy to dismiss <strong> Gold Fever</strong> (BBC1) as a bland video diary documentary, following, as it does, rowers Steve Redgrave, Matthew Pinsent, Tim Foster and James Cracknell as they try to qualify for the Sydney Olympics. There are, as you would expect, lots of the boys in the boat, the boys in the gym and the boys with their families. Yet expectations are surpassed, as in pieces to camera the men speak most frankly, especially Redgrave. As such, Gold Fever becomes a study of male bonding, the frailty of friendship, the unforgiving nature of being in competition and the price of pursuing your dreams. </p> <p>There are some things wrong with <strong> Tinsel Town </strong> (BBC2), the sex, drugs and house-music drama which fills the This Life time-slot but focuses on a younger, more hedonistic crowd. For starters, there's no giant queue for the cubicles in the ladies loo, there are Guinness bar towels on the bar in this supposedly hip'n'young club, and most of the episode feels like a credit sequence. Still, many of the characters are only too recognisable, much of the dialogue achingly true, and with nine parts to come, it should develop into a gripping yarn, a watercooler talking point and the target of The Daily Mail's puritanical vitriol. A ringing endorsement if there ever was one.</p>",
  "Paul Whiteley seems to assume that pensioners are a monolithic bloc of like-minded people defined solely by their age (Grey power, 7 August). But men over 65 and women over 60 are no more monolithic than are, say, all people between 20 and 45, comprising as they do an enormous range of incomes, interests, and social groups. <p> </p> <p>As pensions ministers have recently pointed out, average pensioner income is about double the basic state pension. This disguises, however, a huge age-related disparity. Most people over 85 have little more than the state pension. For the typical 65-year-old, the state pension is a useful bit extra on top of an occupational pension. </p> <p>The problem for any government is to convince people that to abolish pensioner poverty requires something much more radical than the popular, and populist, demand for a big increase in the basic pension for everyone, which would be impossibly expensive and wasteful if it were to have any appreciable effect. To their credit, this is what Alistair Darling and Jeff Rooker have been trying to do, but it is an uphill task. The \u00a390 figure suggested by Age Concern is a good yardstick, but the totem of the basic state pension would be quite the wrong tool to achieve it. </p> <p><b>Alan Pavelin </b><br> Chislehurst, Kent <a href=\"mailto:alan@pavelin.fsnet.co.uk\"> alan@pavelin.fsnet.co.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 Paul Whiteley's excellent article misses one important point. Issues affecting pensioners are not only of interest to pensioners. The retired generation also has children and even grandchildren of voting age - and they too can express their view on behalf of pensioners at the ballot box. </p> <p> Recently I have been out in my local area collecting signatures for the National Pensioners Convention petition calling for a better state pension. I have been overwhelmed by the number of young people who support the campaign. </p> <p><b> Gordon McLennan</b><br> London </p>"
