  "The Guardian reports the RSC is claiming to have \"broken the mould\" by casting a talented black actor in the title role of Shakespeare's Henry VI. I find it hard to believe that anyone at the RSC regards this casting as mould-breaking in any way, given the company's track record in employing black and Asian actors. At a time when the National Theatre tended to cast black actors only in black roles, the RSC was asserting the principle of non-traditional casting and simply getting on with it. <p>From the 60s onwards, Alton Kumalo, Oscar James and Joe Marcell, among others, were regular members of the company. Jeffrey Kissoon, John Matshikiza, Josette Simon - all distinguished themselves in roles where race was never specified. When Trevor Nunn asked me to take over Hotspur from Tim Dalton in 1983 in the production of Henry IV which opened the Barbican theatre, he did so in the face of opposition from distinguished members of the company - my colleagues if not my friends. That casting decision was arguably mould-breaking; this one is not and should not be. The RSC has been here before and it really is no big deal. </p> <p>What is more interesting to me is that editors appear to think their readers would find this newsworthy, believing perhaps that Outraged is still alive in Tunbridge Wells and will soon be penning furious missives at the affront to both history and to Shakespeare at the casting of a \"veritable Negro\" as a British monarch. But I wonder whether this may not be a misreading of the public mood, and certainly a misunderstanding of Shakespeare's history plays. </p> <p>Is it not clear that he used history imaginatively to write about things other than history? Henry VI is not ultimately about Henry VI. (Henry VI is not actually the major role, but never mind.) It is about power, ambition, the grip of one generation on another: universal themes. </p> <p>Do we really still need to argue that if Shakespeare really does have universal appeal, then that appeal goes beyond race and colour, and an actor should be permitted to interpret him regardless of race and colour. Casting in the classical repertoire has been much more receptive to the principle and the practice of non-traditional casting. I find it heartening that Peter Brook asked Adrian Lester to play Hamlet and not Othello, a role written for a white actor in black make-up. </p> <p> Let us hope that directors on this side of the channel follow suit when casting roles such as Macbeth, Falstaff, Lear. There is an unanswerable case for non- traditional casting, not just in the area of so-called colour-blind casting: if Shakespeare and the classical repertoire are not to be made a massive irrelevance to the lives of a modern audience in this millennium, that audience must see itself reflected on stage. Well-spoken white actors shouting the lines of dead white males to a predominantly white audience must become a thing of the past. We must encourage young actors to speak Shakespeare not to recite him, to make his characters recognisable on stage, using a variety of accents. Then, perhaps Guy Ritchie might go to the RSC next time he is casting a film. But I fear we shall have to wait many more years before the cinema and television industries catch up with the classical theatre when it comes to non-traditional casting. </p> <p>There the principle still seems to be that black actors play black roles, except of course in deep space, where the only condition is that you speak with an American accent and keep a straight face, (though exceptions are made for distinguished RSC actors). There are still conventions which govern the playing of Shakespeare, some of which are long past their use-by date. </p> <p>My hope is that a new generation of actors - black, white, Asian, male and female - will question these conventions and create new ones which will, in turn, be questioned by a later generation. And I hope it is in this spirit that Michael Boyd has cast David Oyelowo, because of what he brings to the role, not because of how well he has learnt the conventions. </p> <p>You can take issue with the RSC on a number of grounds - I have done in the past - but not, I think on its commitment to the principle of integrated casting. It might have been newsworthy if the RSC had appointed a black or Asian director or senior manager, but non-traditional casting is, has been and should be a given. </p> <p>My worry is that after all the \"Colour-blind casting shock!\" headlines, David Oyelowo will be subject to the scrutiny of those self-styled arbiters of taste and standards in the classical theatre, some of whom are unable or too lazy to look beyond an actor's colour to his talent. It would be mould-breaking indeed if one of these critics wrote a review without reference to the actor's colour. But it is not only the classical theatre that has its outworn conventions. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Political wives have never been so fascinating, or so it would seem from the amount of attention they have been getting in the US. The Democratic and Republican conventions have been packed with an unprecedented number of testimonials and introductions and cute jokes and homey anecdotes from wives and daughters, not as background, but as a central part of the campaign: elect this man, the message seemed to be, because he once brought his daughter toast and hot chocolate out in the snow. <p>It is interesting that after the long, boring impeachment, when the American public signalled that it couldn't care less about the private lives of its politicians, it is their private lives that are being endlessly promoted in the new political season. First there was the Gores' popular kiss that lasted several beats longer than it had to, and then there was Joe Lieberman, Gore's running mate, calling his wife Hadassah \"sweetheart\" during his acceptance speech. These are not public displays of affection so much as public displays of functionality. It is as if there is a pornographic picture in the back of everyone's mind of Monica Lewinsky in the oval office, and all the candidates all running as hard as they can against that picture with their own cheery vignettes of conjugal bliss. </p> <p>Part of this year's obsession with first marriages may also be that our politicians are so stage-managed, every gesture, every motion so scripted and second-guessed and polled, that there is some doubt as to who they really are. The media's favourite activity now is covering not the candidates, but their coaching, their pollsters and managers, advisers who tell them to wear greens and beiges, and speech writers who craft their rhetorical swells. You would have to be illiterate and without a television set to think that you are getting anywhere near the real man. Somehow, quite irrationally, this leads to the belief that when the candidates' wives come on to the stage in powder-blue suits, you are tapping in to their real lives. </p> <p>The fact that all of this is scripted, too, that the wives' collages of photographs, and daughters' affectionate reminiscences are also staged, doesn't seem to matter. These women - Tipper Gore, Laura Bush, Gore's daughters Karenna and Kristen, Hadassah Lieberman - are not professionals, or don't seem like professionals, and so there is a feeling when they come to the podium, awkward and shy, like Laura, or giddily cheery, like Tipper, that we are getting closer to the men themselves. But are these women humanising their husbands, or are we just reading a lot about how they humanise them? </p> <p>The candidates' wives are being used in a way that vice-presidents have traditionally been used - to balance the candidate, to compensate for a perceived weakness. The wives are not there to support their husbands but to subtly shift perceptions of them. For instance, George W Bush's drunken past, his volatile emotional side, his tendency to curse New York Times reporters, is counteracted by Laura's down-to-earth sweetness. He is \"grounded\" by her, everyone around them constantly tells us. She tempers his excesses. And in much the same way, Tipper's naturalness is offered by the campaign as an antidote to Gore's stiffness. She says that she has a \"commitment to have fun\" on the campaign trail, which does not seem like a commitment Gore has ever made to anyone about anything. </p> <p>And it is true that, at the convention, Tipper seemed at ease enough for both of them. She danced and sashayed across the stage. She seemed happy to the point of giddiness, and one wondered whether her dose of Prozac may have been a tad too high that day. One big point that the Gore campaign likes to make about Tipper, and one that Karenna Gore (their eldest daughter) made at the convention, is that she is an enfant terrible, a free spirit, albeit a harmless one, who tells reporters whatever is on her mind. Her handlers cannot control her. </p> <p>The message that is put out to the press is that no message can be put out to the press. She is just too authentic, too true to herself. The idea is that you are getting pure, uncensored access to the Gore family. The character of Tipper is meant to counteract everything you have seen or read or know about her husband's lack of spontaneity. In high school she played drums with a girl band called the Wild Cats. She painted a naked self-portrait when she was pregnant. She goes barefoot on Airforce Two. She is Gore's frolicking unselfconscious other half. The plump blonde id of the Gore campaign. </p> <p>Laura, an ex-elementary school librarian, is quintessentially unthreatening in an entirely different way. With her short, sensible hair, bright blue eyes and dowdy style, she is a vague maternal figure who somehow manages to stay vague no matter how many times she speaks or is profiled. When she stood on the podium at the Republican convention there was an absence of slickness, a lack of charisma, of heat and desire, that played well. Much was made of how nervous she was before her speech (\"I get butterflies a little bit thinking about it\") and that nervousness translated into a middle American ordinariness, a modesty that people found appealing. </p> <p>The New York Times headlined its profile of her \"Quiet Strength\", which is exactly the image the Bush campaign was trying to project. Even the \"political problems\" with Laura seem to serve a shrewd function. For instance, she doesn't agree with her husband on all of the issues, such as abortion. She loyally refuses to talk about it. But, in fact, having a wife who disagrees with him in a quiet way can't hurt a candidate seeking women's votes and trying to soften his anti-choice image without alienating his core constituency. </p> <p>And then there is, of course, the great unspoken shadow of the current first lady - the dislike that rises in her wake, and leaves the campaigns scrambling to define exactly how their candidates are not like Hillary Clinton without saying it too directly. Laura says things like: \"I don't really want to talk about the issues that much. I am not that knowledgeable about most issues.\" Tipper says things like: \"With four children and ageing parents I find that I only spend so much time on the issues that I care about, and I spend a lot of time on keeping the family together.\" In other words, we couldn't have two aspiring first ladies less interested in politics. </p> <p>Both campaigns have made quite a show of how their candidates' wives were resistant to public life. Bush recounts over and over how he promised his wife that she would never have to give a political speech before she would agree to marry him, and her friends give accounts that she would trade it all in \"for long afternoons of reading and mornings of gardening, and be utterly happy\". Meanwhile, Gore aides send out reports of how fearful Tipper was that a presidential campaign would consume her family, and how apprehensive she was about her husband's first run for congress. </p> <p>It seems important that the point is made: these are spotlight-shunning, un-power-hungry women. Not shrinking violets, either of them, but women who don't possess a single ounce of vicarious ambition. Either one of them, their campaigns seem to say, will be dragged reluctantly yet dutifully into the oval office. These are the un-Hillarys being displayed for the American public. (Though it should be pointed out that their distaste for political life seems largely theoretical: Laura is being cast by her husband's camp as an extremely reluctant campaigner, but in February alone she reluctantly campaigned in 22 different states.) </p> <p>The wives of America's current candidates are studiedly old-fashioned. Even the Democrats stress that Tipper will be a first lady \"in the traditional mould\". These women are housewives and mothers. They gave up their temporary and unpassionate careers for their husbands in an era when it was no longer common to do so. They devote themselves to their families, and have mild artistic pursuits, such as photography and painting and reading. They present a sweetly pastoral image of American womanhood that has nothing whatsoever to do with American women. Somehow, America seems to want a first lady who represents not the values of the country, but the values of the country 50 years ago. </p> <p>It is a curious pocket of sexism, a pocket of nostalgia, that represents not what women are but an old portrait of them that, some of us at least, apparently still long for: the mother who stays home; the supportive wife; the quiet strength. As if behind every powerful man is a not-so-powerful woman. So far it has worked. Laura Bush and Tipper Gore are both immensely popular. (Though the campaigns are careful not to make it seem like they are too retrograde. For instance, Laura used to refer to herself as \"shy\" and now denies it, as does everyone around her with a regularity so noticeable that the New York Times said it was \"as if they all received the same memo\".) </p> <p>Gore said in his convention speech, \"This is not a popularity contest,\" but, of course, that is exactly what it is. Today's candidates have to be liked, and known in the manner of the captain of the football team. Neither Gore nor Bush are particularly adept at giving the crucial illusion of intimacy, of making the voter feel like they know him, making the voter dream about him, the way Bill Clinton famously is. Without that gift for intimacy the voter has to be drawn into the candidate's kitchen by other means. They have to feel like they have been invited over to dinner and chatted with. To do what Clinton could do with a bite of his lip, with a throaty laugh, with a lazy smile, these candidates have to call in reserves - their pleasant, unthreatening wives.</p>",
  "<p>Dixons, Britain's largest electrical retailer, is creating 1,000 jobs at its expanded call centre in Sheffield. </p> <p>The recruitment drive follows the firm's decision to centralise all customer services in Yorkshire. </p> <p>Its announcement yesterday is the second phase of a \u00a345m project which has already seen 650 staff taken on. The investment will be a tonic for Sheffield, which has reinvented itself since the days when most of its population was employed in the steelworks. </p> <p>Tony Ackroyd, Dixons Group contact centres director, said the centre was on the 11-acre Nunnery Square site. \"The first phase created 650 new jobs and invested almost \u00a330m in the local economy. When phase two is fully operational we expect to have created up to 2,000 jobs with a total investment of around \u00a345m.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for Dixons said the centre would eventually receive all inquiries - including advice on setting up machinery and ordering spare parts - which were previously dealt with at the head office in Hemel Hempstead. </p> <p>\"Customers of electrical retailers tend to want a lot of after-sales service,\" he said. \"We wanted to centralise all our customer contact activities.\" </p> <p>The call centre industry has been one of the success stories of the past five years, despite some debate about the career prospects and security of tenure they offer. </p> <p>Most retailers, manufacturers and financial service companies have either established their own centres or contracted out the operation to independent operators. </p> <p>South Yorkshire, whose economy has suffered dramatically from the decline of steel and coal, is a favoured location because costs are relatively low and labour is plentiful. </p> <p>Earlier this month Dixons announced sales for the 18 weeks to September 2 were 29% ahead of the same period last year and 5% up on a like-for-like basis.</p>"
