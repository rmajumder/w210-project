  "<p>Unemployment in many of Britain's hard-core centres of joblessness is the result of a continued lack of available work rather than a dearth of skills amongst those on the dole, according to a report out today. </p> <p>Rejecting government claims that unemployment is now largely a \"skills\" problem, a study by Cambridge Econometrics said that almost 500,000 people, mainly in the north of England, were unable to work because of limited job opportunities. </p> <p>The report by the forecasting think tank underlined the north-south divide in Britain's jobs market despite the fall in the number of people out of work and claiming benefit to a 20-year-low of 1.1m. </p> <p>\"Unemployment rates are generally higher than the UK average in the north of England, and a higher proportion of areas fall into the jobs shortfall category, notably the majority of jobs centres in Yorkshire and the Humber, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, and Northumberland.\" </p> <p>Ministers, including the chancellor, Gordon Brown, have argued that the jobs outlook for Britain is now much more uniform than it was in the 80's and early 90's, with regional disparities narrowing and a growing number of unfilled vacancies. </p> <p>Cambridge Econometrics said there was evidence that the real level of unemployment was being under-reported in areas where job prospects were weak. It said a shortage of skills was the key factor for fewer than one-in-three unemployed workers claiming benefit. </p> <p>\"More than 300,000 unemployed live in areas where skills mismatch appears to be the dominant issue,\" it said, adding that most of these lived in Scotland, Wales and scattered parts of the north including Durham and the Wirral. Scottish areas have seen the decline of traditional manufacturing sectors, such as shipbuilding, mechanical engineering and textiles and it appears that the unemployed are not taking up jobs in the thriving electronics sector and, in some areas, growing services employment. </p> <p>\"However, more than 450,000 unemployed are in areas where a jobs shortfall appears to be the dominant issue, with the majority of them in the north of England.\" </p> <p>With the report also forecasting that growth in the south will continue to outstrip that in the north, the findings are likely to fuel demands for the government to take a more aggressive approach to regional policy, with action to increase the demand for labour in areas that have yet to feel the benefits of more than eight years of economic growth. </p> <p>One of the factors that contributed to the lengthening of the dole queues in the early 80's was the arrival in the workforce of the baby boomer generation.</p>"
