  "It is one of those issues that captivates the political junkies and leaves the ordinary voter cold. Or, as one Democratic consultant puts it: \"Nobody gives a shit about this stuff.\" The \"stuff\" in question is soft money and it has dominated Hillary Clinton's campaign for a seat in the US senate since her first televised debate with the Republican candidate, Rick Lazio who, it has been said, bears an uncanny resemblance to the presenter of BBC's Match Of The Day. <p>\"I believe, personally, it is an important issue, but there are not many New York voters who think it is an important issue,\" says Mrs Clinton. \"No voters ever talk to me about soft money.\" That's because none of them really knows what it is. And because the matter is complicated, popular newspapers do not have the room to explain it and make it interesting at the same time. </p> <p>As with any episode in an election campaign, it is possible - just about - to perceive winners and losers, and in this instance Mr Lazio has won, even if the prize is a nebulous mutation of justification and credibility.</p> <p>So what is soft money? Candidates are limited by law to accept contributions from individuals of up to $2,000 (\u00a31,300) - that is hard money. But this cap is sidestepped by big-money donors and wealthy special interest groups who give unlimited amounts for \"issue advertisements\" that can barely be told apart from those for the candidates, except that they do not call explicitly for the election or defeat of either - and that is soft money. Just in case it might help, there are also TV and radio advertisements paid for by independent groups, say the National Rifle Association, which buy ads backing one candidate or excoriating the other.</p> <p>Mr Lazio, an outwardly amiable but previously obscure Congressman from Long Island thought it was time to up the tempo of the contest and go beyond appealing to voters simply on the basis that he is not Mrs Clinton. So at one point during the debate he strode over to her and waved in her face a piece of paper called The New York Freedom from Soft Money Agreement and demanded she sign it on the spot, which she declined to do. </p> <p>Most of the commentators judged that Mr Lazio had scored a few points with this and other ploys. Which was fine until the two polls after the debate showed that while this might be fine with the professionals, the voters - especially women - had divined little about the issue but a lot about him. They thought he was a bully.</p> <p>The Republican had to try, somehow, to demonstrate that there was a purpose to all this, that he was on a crusade to drive out the influence of those who try to buy favour from the candidates. Never mind that Mr Lazio, on the face of it, has more to gain than Mrs Clinton from the absence of soft money in the race for the senate. He had not raised any of the stuff for ads while she had spent it freely. </p> <p>On the other hand, she would still be able to spend soft money on mail-shots, phone banks and measures to get the vote out. As for the hard stuff, he has $10.2m to her $7.1m. Also, her campaign was the first to suggest banning soft money, even if she did not press the matter.</p> <p>Finally, after a feeble stunted confrontation and some proper meetings, the two sides struck a deal. They agreed that only those TV and radio ads paid for by accumulations of those measly $2,000 donations would be allowed. Soft money from corporations, unions and influence-hungry individuals could not be used for this purpose. On top of that, those independent groups operating on behalf of one candidate or the other were implored to stay their hands.</p> <p>Normal people may be more interested in the impending baseball World Series, but this is considered a historic agreement that could set a precedent for other elections and help the cause of campaign-finance reform in Congress. You can't argue with that. Well, you might not think so but others are less impressed by this exercise in openness, decency and restraint. </p> <p>Take the AFL-CIO federation of labour unions, a supporter of Mrs Clinton. \"We are not going to pledge not to do things,\" says Laurence Gold, its associate general counsel. \"The campaigns can never secure promises from every conceivable group.\"</p> <p>Then there is the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Clinton. \"We raised lots of money from people,\" says Morton Blackwell, its chairman. \"We are completely independent. No campaign or party can direct us.\" </p> <p>If this qualifies as historic, perhaps it's just as well that the public is looking the other way.</p>",
  "<p>The petrol crisis has prompted a serious rethink among some of Europe's motorists as they rush to escape the ever-present threat of higher prices by buying the latest models powered by fuel efficient, high performance, low emission diesel engines produced by manufacturers such as VW, Peugeot and even BMW. </p> <p>Yesterday, on the eve of the Paris motor show, analysts reported that around a third of new cars bought in Europe this year will be diesel compared with just 15% a decade ago. </p> <p>But the ramping up of crude oil prices and its impact on forecourts allied with regulations to reduce greenhouse gases has prompted both oil companies and car makers to bring forward the unthinkable: vehicles no longer fuelled by petrol or diesel but by alternative energy sources such as hydrogen - an apparently limitless and non-pollutant fuel previously thought of in connection with only nuclear or rocket technology. </p> <p>At an extraordinarily eerie filling station behind the cargo area at the Bavarian capital's airport, you can already fill up a top of the range BMW 7 series with the fuel of the future: liquid hydrogen. A robotic arm, triggered by a series of electronic messages from the dashboard and a smart payment card, glides out and fills the 750HL with up to 140 litres of liquid hydrogen - enough to travel 400km. </p> <p>The fuel is stored, at -253 C, in a tank fitted behind the rear seats that, according to Martin Geier, a BMW research executive, can withstand a full scale, rear end crash. The 5.4 litre engine, producing 204HP, does 0-100km in 9.6 seconds (compared with 6.8 for a conventional 750iL) and has a top speed of 226km an hour (compared with 250). It uses 40 litres per 100km compared with 13.8 for its conventional sister and the three or four litres of petrol now targeted by manufacturers. And in case the hydrogen runs out and the driver is not near the DM34m (\u00a310m) filling station at the airport, it has a 95-litre reserve petrol tank. </p> <p>The only problem is that you cannot yet buy the vehicle. There are only 15 such cars running in Germany. But Burkhard Goeschel, BMW's development director, says the engine has reached the stage where it is virtually ready to go into series production, and forecasts that at least several thousand will have been sold within the next few years. </p> <p>\"Series production, technically, can be started within a couple of months,\" says Mr Geier. </p> <p><strong> Future rivals</strong><br> </p> <p> BMW has opted for liquid hydrogen, now extracted from natural gas by its project partner Linde, rather than the hydrogen fuel cells being developed by rival groups which have forged strategic partnerships: Ford and DaimlerChrysler with Canadian cell producer Ballard and General Motors and Toyota, for instance. </p> <p>\"Everyone is buying a ticket to the lottery because we all know that whoever wins will win big time,\" says Paul Everitt, chief economist at the Society of Motor manufacturers and Traders. \"Nobody really knows what the market will be nor what is the right technology - they know they just have to be in the game.\" </p> <p>BMW says it favours liquid hydrogen because that guarantees higher performance than fuel cells which, so far, can enable a car to run for around 230km rather than the 400km of the 750HL and because it promises nil emissions </p> <p>However, says Mr Everitt, the extraction of hydrogen from water or gas is now achieved at considerable environmental impact - and manufacturers are betting on several tickets, including hybrid vehicles, in advance of a market that is still in the making. </p> <p>\"Nobody says they're going to win, and there's a considerable degree of doubt. They all have their own strategy and if you get it right and hit it first, you'll be the first one into the market and have a very clear competitive advantage,\" he says. </p> <p>So the oil companies such as BP Amoco are backing the car groups' alliances but equally hedging their bets as to the outcome, torn between their awareness that in the medium term oil may no longer fuel the modern economies and short-term issues of cost and competitiveness. </p> <p>Fritz Vahrenholt, a German Shell executive involved in the BMW project, says: \"The first hydrogen filling stations are here now. In 20 years every other new car worldwide should be capable of running on hydrogen. That's our objective.\" </p> <p><strong> Crude rethink</strong><br> </p> <p> The recent fuel crisis underlined the degree to which modern economies depend on oil but also that to which oil is a finite resource. Opec countries already realise that the time for achieving maximum revenues may be relatively short-lived, and Saudi Arabian ministers have said that the emergence of alternative fuels such as hydrogen should stabilise oil prices. </p> <p>BMW's Mr Geier points to an immediate snag: the absence of a national infrastructure to support alternative fuels. </p> <p>\"We could start production when we know our politicians are willing to support this and we have had no clear statements, even from the red-green coalition in Berlin, that hydrogen will be the fuel of the future.\" </p> <p>The more fundamental snag remains the issue at the heart of the stand-off between farmers and hauliers and their governments: tax. BMW executives acknowledge that without fiscal incentives the development of hydrogen-fuelled cars will be delayed or even prevented. </p> <p>So groups such as BMW may be ready to produce hydrogen-fuelled cars in volume but the political process has yet to encourage this. </p> <p>The recent crisis on the roads of Europe may yet prove to be the spur for a radical rethink which, within the next decade or so, will see us queuing up for fuel at filling stations such as the now deserted facility at Munich's airport.</p>"
