  "<p>The US unemployment rate sank to a 30-year low last month, raising doubts about the extent of the economic slowdown and rekindling fears of higher interest rates. </p> <p>The labour department said the economy created 252,000 jobs in September, sending the unemployment rate back down to 3.9% from August's 4.1%. Last month's jobless rate was equal to the low recorded in April. The fall came as a surprise to Wall Street analysts who, after seeing the jobless rate creep upwards in recent months, had expected it to remain unchanged. The market took comfort from the fact that wage growth - up just 0.2% - remained subdued, but the resilience of the job market raised doubts about the extent of the slowdown in US growth. </p> <p>Stock markets fell, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index tumbling more than 2% and the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average losing 0.75% by midday. </p> <p>Paul Kasriel, economist at Northern Trust in Chicago, said: \"The economy has slowed down but this report is suggesting that it is not continuing to slow.\" </p> <p>Kevin Logan, of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson North America in New York, said the tightness of the labour market cast doubt on the growing view that rates had peaked. </p> <p>Earlier in the week the Federal Reserve kept the federal funds overnight bank lending rate at 6.5%. However, it warned that the nation's tight job market and rising energy prices still risked pushing up inflation. </p> <p>The euro dipped below 87 cents after the data was published, but bounced back near 87.10 amid market fears of further central bank intervention.</p>",
  "<p>Does direct action work or do you risk becoming a nuisance? There are times when cutting out the middle man has more effect than going through the proper channels - job hunting online is one of those occasions, but only if you approach it intelligently. </p> <p>The message from employers who encourage speculative applications through their web sites is simple. If your communication is thoughtful and well researched it's welcome; if you're just a bored bulk-mailer, don't bother. </p> <p>It's not surprising that IBM's job pages include the open invitation \"have a look through to find something relevant to you - even if you can't, still contact us\" or that Inktomi say it's better to receive more CVs than not enough. When they get a CV from a good candidate for whom they don't have a position, they create one. </p> <p>UK director of marketing, Joe Frost, regrets that Britons don't have as strong a culture of speculative application as the Americans. \"Graduates need to get over the idea that there's a stigma to </p> <p>applying speculatively. In the new economy there's a new set of rules. Jobs are filled in a matter of days and rarely get to be advertised on the internet, let alone in print. It's going to be the proactive, speculative people that get them.\" </p> <p> This welcoming attitude exists amongst less hi-tech employers too, although the closer their relationship to emerging technologies, the more likely they are to be short of staff. So, if you're desperate for a career in PR or marketing, target companies that have hi-tech clients; if you want to get into journalism or publishing look at companies with a strong online presence. It's stating the obvious that organisations with skill shortages are the most welcoming. But then would you want to work for anyone else? </p> <p>These companies are expanding, they offer excitement, rapid career development and treat their staff well because retention is important. </p> <p>Check the next site you look at for a \"jobs @\" or \"work for us\" link. Many companies have sections devoted to helping the hopeful make targeted applications for jobs that don't exist yet. If there's nothing specific, treat the whole site as a recruitment brochure. Tristan Palmer, MD of Corpex, says he only advertises conventionally when he's desperate. \"Getting good speculative applications is a real bonus. It shows commitment.\" </p> <p>Cambridge company Zeus Technology, believes unsolicited applications are so important they've covered a BMW Z3 with their email address to encourage electronic applicants. </p> <p> David Ferguson, the firm's vice-president, maintains it's a cost effective way to recruit. \"'We like to employ people with a lot of get up and go. We're impressed by the initiative of those who contact us in this way even before we read their CV.\" </p> <p>For some employers the fact an application arrives electronically is significant. Peter Bedford of Oyster Partners, an internet professional </p> <p>services firm, cannot remember the last time he received a CV by post. \"In our business I'd be concerned if candidates submitted their details in any other way. We are always interested to hear from talented individuals clever enough to suggest we employ them.\" </p> <p>Another factor that makes employers positive about unsolicited applications is cost. Although Corpex is relatively small, Palmer estimates he will spend \u00a3150,000 on recruitment in agency fees alone this year. \"Many agencies no longer offer refunds if the person you take on leaves after a short period, so I'm more willing to take a risk with a candidate who approaches me directly. </p> <p>\"If they haven't got all the skills I need, but show an understanding of what we do and are willing to learn, I've got nothing to lose by taking them on.\" </p> <p> The timing of such approaches is less important than it used to be. In growth industries, any time is the right time. Because those employers are permanently looking for talent they have developed systems for storing speculative applications. </p> <p>However, some companies, swamped by ill-researched email applications have stopped making contact details available. Richard Alberg, CEO of Psychometric Services says: \"The paradox is that everyone's looking for good staff. The more applications you attract the more likely you are to find just the people you're looking for, but dealing with huge numbers presents a problem.\" </p> <p>His organisation provides systems that companies and employment agencies incorporate into their recruitment pages to filter applications and encourage a more thoughtful approach. </p> <p>Others adopt simpler but equally effective methods of discouraging the casual mailer. Guardian Unlimited accepts speculative applications by email only and provides detailed instructions to ensure applicants prove they are creative and internet astute. Those targeting an editorial internship for example, need to supply a 200 word description of their commitment to a career in journalism or new media, a list of five strengths in the Guardian Unlimited sites and five suggested innovations. </p> <p>\u0095 Daryl Willcox, MD of the Daryl Group, an online publishing company, hasn't received a well researched speculative CV in three years. Although he finds such mail bothersome and time-consuming, he continues accepting it because he feels it's an approach that should work. </p> <p>He's looking for new graduates and career changers to work in research, sales and administration and maintains their attitude is more important than qualifications. </p> <p>\"I'd be immensely flattered to feel someone had researched our company thoroughly and decided it was for them. I'm not bothered about detailed CVs. A short email which showed this would do.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Irene Krechowiecka is the author of Net That Job (2nd Edition), published by Kogan Page.</p>"
