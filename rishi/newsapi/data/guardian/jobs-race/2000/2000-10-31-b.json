  "A woman cricket executive was turned down for a job at Lancashire Cricket Club because her gender was seen as unacceptable to traditionalists, an employment tribunal was told yesterday. <p>Maria Grant, 45, a former executive director of the Women's Cricket Association, is claiming sexual discrimination by the Lancashire board after she failed to make the shortlist for assistant secretary and development coordinator at the club. </p> <p>The tribunal in Manchester was told one reason given by the board was \"a lack of knowledge of men's cricket\", despite her having played, managed and coached cricket for more than 15 years. She responded: \"There is no significant difference in how men and women play cricket, nor in the way it is administered. In requiring such knowledge I was bound to be treated less favourably by the selection committee than the eight candidates who were shortlisted, because they were all men.\" </p> <p>The tribunal heard that Ms Grant had been a force behind developing women's cricket in the north-west, sitting as regional officer of the north west sports council. She applied for the \u00a324,000 Lancashire job in July 1999, thinking she was perhaps overqualified having run a national organisation, but feeling it was a step to her goal of being the first female chief executive of a county club. </p> <p>Astonished not to be on the shortlist, she wrote to the board secretary, David Edmundson. He replied that the grounds were, among others, a lack of budget and coaching experience and \"a perception that [she] would not be personally fully acceptable to the leagues [local teams associated with the county club]\". </p> <p>Ms Grant told the tribunal the first could not fairly be applied to her; she had the same or a better coaching qualification as some shortlisted, but that criterion had not been mentioned in the job application; and the view she would not be acceptable was a \"coded expression\" of the reaction the selection committee felt her appointment would provoke among conservative thinkers who run the leagues and clubs. </p> <p>\"I can only infer that this perceived non-acceptability is on the ground of sex _ changing attitudes takes a long time, and there remains a large and powerful group who maintain 'traditional conservative values' and who still regard cricket as a 'man's game' despite the fact that women have been playing since at least 1745.\" </p> <p>The hearing continues.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The problem</strong></p> <p>I have a very busy, sometimes stressful job that I often don't like. This is probably due to the fact that I don't like anyone I work with and I feel underpaid and used. I also feel uneasy there - the environment and ethos are not \"me\". </p> <p>My friend and I have decided for a change and are moving to Leeds. She has found herself a job already, but cannot live there until I have found one, but I just can't find the time or energy to throw myself into finding a new job.</p> <p>I keep wondering, should I just hand in my notice so I can search properly or continue in the busy job taking double the amount of time, trying to snatch sneaky days off for interviews, with the whole process taking painfully long. Am I being rash and stupid if I hand my notice in first without having a job to go to? </p> <p><strong>The solution</strong></p> <p>I think you know what you should do, but need some reassurance that you are doing the right thing. You don't like your job, don't like your colleagues, you're underpaid, starting to make mistakes at work, don't like the work environment and spend four hours every day commuting. No wonder you are stressed, tired and lack the energy to job-hunt! </p> <p>You are in an impossible situation and you know it - you want to and need to get out, but the demands of your job mean that you can't. As you yourself say, if you packed the job in you could search properly and be less stressed and tired. Is \"this rash and stupid\"? Under the circumstances, it sounds rather sensible to me. Packing your job in would allow you the space and time to sit back and re-evaluate your career and want you want, as well as allow you to apply for jobs and go to interviews without the whole process taking a 'painfully long time'.</p> <p>The only things holding you back are financial considerations and concern about how this will look to future employers. On the second point, it is possible that some employers will wonder why you packed the job in, or favour someone who is currently employed. But this can easily be explained by a short statement in your covering letter about your need to relocate to be with your partner. One or two employers might still be wary, but most will simply accept it. </p> <p>As for the finance, maybe you could get a part-time job somewhere to tide you over. Or see this time off as an investment into your health, career and future. Put like that, even if it takes a few months to get yourself sorted, it would seem a wise investment. </p> <p> \u0095 Dr Sandi Mann is author of Psychology Goes to Work (Purple House) and Managing Your Boss in a Week (Hodder &amp; Stoughton).</p> <p>Advice given to this problem should only be regarded as a guide based on the limited information provided by the letter-writer.
