  "<p>The football authorities are racing against time to save the professional game from chaos. That may sound an exaggeration but it is not. By the end of next month their tormentors' patience will have run out. </p> <p>The villain of the piece is the European Union. About a year ago they made it known that they were unhappy with players being sold in mid-contract for huge transfer fees. </p> <p>The Treaty of Rome guarantees workers free movement within the European Union. Footballers are workers, the EU argues. High transfer fees are an obstacle to that free movement. So they asked Fifa, the world game's governing bidy, to change the system. </p> <p>Fifa dallied, appearing contemptuous of EU law. But the more it dallied the more the EU lost patience until recently they threatened simply to rule the current transfer system illegal. That would see clubs legally refusing to pay any transfer fee for players joining them. </p> <p>With such a doomsday scenario in sight, it took football's European governing body, Uefa, with the Premier League, Football Association and Football League in the vanguard, to spot the seriousness of the situation. </p> <p>Someone needed to head off the EU at the pass with an alternative proposal. So the three domestic bodies and others set up a working party which, by the middle of next month, is confident of coming up with a counter-proposal. </p> <p>It will first go to Uefa, then to Fifa, which is expected to be only too happy to have some ideas to put forward to the EU by next month's deadline. </p> <p>Actually Fifa, belatedly, has also been working on its own proposals including, it is understood, a contingency plan to cope with the expected knock-on effect of an end to transfer fees: even higher salaries for players. </p> <p>According to Christophe Forax, spokesman for the EU commissioner for sport Vivian Reding: \"I think Fifa is thinking about a system of salary caps. That would be another bombshell. </p> <p>Fifa was unavailable for comment yesterday. However, Michael Kennedy, the agent of \u00a352,000-a-week Roy Keane, acknowledges that higher salaries are on the cards: \"If the changes go through, it is going to result in players' earnings increasing substantially. So it will be good for the players. But, as for football as a whole, I think it could lead to disruption.\" </p> <p>Exactly what kind, is spelled out by the Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale: \"If the threat from the EU to the present transfer system is not stopped, the game will be thrown into chaos. The abolition of the transfer system will undermine the financial viability of every club which has historically developed its own young talent.\" </p> <p>It would also remove vital transfer income from smaller clubs. The prospects of many going under as a result is just one reason why the football authorities are working overtime to come up with their damage-limitation plan. </p> <p>\"We are aware the system is under serious threat and of the need for urgent action,\" says the Premier League spokesman Philip French. \"Everyone in England is working together on a solution and we all share the same objectives and are co-operating fully with Uefa and Fifa. </p> <p>\"We are looking to create a dialogue with the [European] Commission giving them a clear understanding of the strengths of the current system and implications of it disappearing without a sensible replacement, while positively examining alternatives to any areas of weakness.\" </p> <p>Basically they hope to persuade the EU that footballers' contracts should not be the same as other workers'. For instance, most workers need normally to give only one month's notice to leave. No football competition can be run on that basis. </p> <p>The football authorities will suggest a year's notice period and hope they can rescue some element of the transfer fee by arguing that money generated from the transfer system goes into community infrastructures such as youth academies. </p> <p>They also plan a compensation fee based on how long is left on a player's contract and the size of his salary, plus any costs involved in training the player. For example, compensation for Michael Owen would work out at: four years at \u00a335,000 a week = \u00a37.28m. </p> <p>The EU is willing to make concessions. \"We are ready to speak about the specificity of sport,\" said Forax. \"We are not fully considering professional players as normal workers,\" adding that the EU is \"ready to discuss an indemnity for the training for players\" and \"a transitional period\" before any changes are introduced, preventing millions being wiped off players' value overnight. </p> <p>The EC is also understood to have agreed that one month's notice on a player's contract is unworkable. </p> <p><strong>What it means</strong></p> <p><strong>Michael Owen</strong> <br> <strong> Club </strong> Liverpool <br> <strong> Value under new system:</strong> \u00a37.3m </p> <p><strong>Harry Kewell</strong><br> <strong> Club </strong> Leeds United <br> <strong> Value under new system:</strong> \u00a39.1m </p> <p><strong>Steve McManaman</strong><br> <strong> Club </strong> Real Madrid<br> <strong> Value under new system:</strong> \u00a312.5m </p> <p><strong>Kevin Phillips</strong><br> <strong> Club </strong> Sunderland <br> <strong> Value under new system:</strong> \u00a35.2m </p> <p><strong>Nick Barmby</strong><br> <strong> Club </strong> Liverpool<br> <strong> Value under new system:</strong> \u00a38.3m </p> <p><strong>Paul Gascoigne</strong><br> <strong> Club </strong> Everton <br> <strong> Value under new system:</strong> \u00a32.1m </p> <p><strong>Duncan Ferguson</strong><br> <strong> Club </strong> Everton <br> <strong> Value under new system:</strong> \u00a37.25m</p>",
  "<p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has announced that it is to prosecute nearly 2,000 unauthorised Olympic websites and scour the internet for further sites said to be infringing its \"property rights\" during the Sydney Games. </p> <p>The IOC yesterday confirmed that it had filed a lawsuit in the US federal court against more than 1,800 registered internet domain names, but denied the crackdown was motivated by a desire to protect its lucrative TV contract with official US broadcaster NBC. </p> <p>\"The lawsuit is not necessarily linked to the Sydney Games,\" said an IOC spokeswoman. \"We are not trying to punish internet users. But we want to take the names back. The name 'Olympic' should only be used by the IOC.\" NBC paid $4bn (\u00a32.5bn) for the exclusive rights to televise the Games in the US from 1998 until 2008. </p> <p>Because of the time difference between Sydney and the US, the NBC coverage will be taped. Prime-time American audiences will watch the Olympics as if live several hours later. </p> <p>NBC's official website, <a href=\"http://www.NBCOlympics.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.NBCOlympics.com</a>, will also stream footage from the competition with a time delay. Access to its site is restricted to the 4m Americans who have high-speed internet access. </p> <p>Renegade internet sites broadcasting pirate coverage of the Games could undermine this deal. Mainstream internet broadcasters outside the US, such as the BBC, will be precluded from showing competition footage on their sites because of the IOC-NBC arrangement. </p> <p>Backed by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), and the Salt Lake Organising Committee for the Olympic Winter Games of 2002 (SLOC), the IOC said it was pursuing its joint action through the US courts to \"take advantage\" of US law, where the Anti-cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) was brought in last year. </p> <p>Sites using the words \"Olympic\" or \"Olympiad\" - and foreign equivalents of such names - will be instructed to shut down. Of the 1,800 unauthorised domains named in the IOC's suit, 168 are said to falsely represent an association with the 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006 Olympic Games, 69 claim to sell tickets or other Games-related services for profit, 43 relate to gambling, and 15 are associated with pornographic material or services. </p> <p>Richard Pound, IOC's first vice-president and chairman of the IOC marketing commission, said: \"These cybersquatters are out there using Olympic properties for their own benefit with no return to the Olympic movement and are damaging the value of those properties. Before the ACPA, we, like so many other organisations, had little recourse.\" </p> <p>The move to sue sites registered by individuals who reside in countries outside the US echoes the ongoing attempt by French activists to prosecute Yahoo! for allowing the sale of Nazi memorabilia on its site in France. In both cases prosecutors in one country are attempting to control content held on websites registered in another. </p> <p>The IOC has hired a special team of \"software developers\" to search the internet for sites containing content that is infringing what they claim is their \"property rights\". Once found, the manager of the site will be told to shut the site down. </p> <p>Amateur athletic enthusiasts and anti-Olympic protest groups could also be targeted under the IOC's action. </p> <p>People who attend an Olympic event, take an amateur photograph, and upload it to their personal web page could technically face prosecution. However, sources close to the anti-Olympic protest movement - who believe they are threatened by the lawsuit - suggest that the IOC's proposals might be technically unworkable. </p> <p>It is relatively easy to search for text on the internet using computer software, called \"spiders\", that is programmed to hunt for key words. But searching for moving images is a different matter. One activist, calling themselves \"Predator\" and claiming to represent the Sydney Independent Media Centre - who plan to show footage of the planned anti-Olympic protests - said: \"The Corporate Games is certainly not about sharing the spirit, it's about getting paid, moving units, market share. </p> <p>\"What they'll do is target their efforts on 'likely competitors' - independent media centres and dot.orgs like it. I will be surprised if people can't block them [IOC]. We see regular search engine spiders in the logs all the time.\" Nevertheless, sites backing the anti-Olympic protests will be taking few chances. Sources close to the Sydney Independent Media Centre claim that their site is hosted outside Australia and can be moved around the globe at regular intervals. </p> <p> <strong>Useful links: </strong><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.olympics.com/eng/\">Official Sydney Olympics website</a></p>",
  "Britain's top boardrooms are beginning to look like the Premiership in English football: escalating salaries irrespective of performance, a disregard for public opinion, an increasing number of foreign players and no women. <p>Our latest survey shows that basic boardroom salaries - excluding stock options - rose by 16% last year, or three and a half times the rate of growth of average earnings. This is not a one-off correction of an anomaly. It has been going on for years. Nor is it a reward for exceptional individual performance, since the vast majority of board members share in the annual harvest. There are no women in the top 20 (though Marjorie Scardino, chief executive of Pearson, has this year managed to creep into the top 30 at 26th). Four of the top six highest earning directors are from overseas. </p> <p>It is right and proper that managers with outstanding talent should be properly rewarded. What is unacceptable is the way that top executive remuneration has become a self-perpetuating gravy train. Committees of non-executive directors (themselves the future beneficiaries of the climate they help to nourish) recommend increases linked to a going rate in the outside world. It is a recipe for a rising spiral of inflation that would never be tolerated by the same directors when they fix their employees' pay. </p> <p>Directors are supposed to lead from the front. It is time they took the lead on pay - or else the divide between the highest and the lowest paid in the country will widen to socially unacceptable proportions. If they don't do it, then shareholders, who are starting to understand the untapped power they possess as owners of companies, must take the lead instead. And what about the government? Last year ministers promised to change legislation to make it easier for shareholders to act on unacceptable increases. We are still waiting for a statement. Meanwhile, the gravy train is one of the few that doesn't run late.</p>"
