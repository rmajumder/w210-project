  "<p>Anyone currently entertaining the notion that the past week's Big Brother was rather dull, and that maybe Channel 4 moved it forward a scheduling slot at precisely the wrong moment - think again, dissenters. Yes, there was rather more snoozing and task-fulfilling going on than one might have hoped. </p> <p>No, watching Anna count her lunges to and from the loo doesn't quite qualify as scintillating, titillating, Who-Wants-To-Be-A-Millionaire?-rivalling TV. </p> <p>And yes, there are only so many times we can wonder over the curious microclimate, which allows this nubile young household to sunbathe whilst the rest of us shiver in light sports jackets and jeans. But the subtext! Most significantly, this was the week when it finally became clear that no one would be sleeping with anyone, at any time. All hopes for a sweaty, grasping union between pneumatic Claire and the ridiculously squat Craig faded with the proposed expulsee short list, and the high-voltage coquetry of Mel seems like a distant memory already. </p> <p>But better yet, Big Brother himself has undergone a total personality transformation. Having spent the past six weeks posing as inscrutable, stern, authoritarian, a sinister voice of reason and all-round grown-up, he's finally morphed into a puerile, lascivious and downright irresponsible type. These days, it's hard not to picture him as the kind of middle-aged man who writes serious reviews of massage parlours, and subscribes to erotica. </p> <p>\"Take all your clothes off, and photocopy your bits,\" he sniggered. </p> <p>\"Splash about in the hot tub with Claire. She's had a boob job, you know,\" he slimed. </p> <p>\"Oops, did I not soundproof the diary room? Have I caused chaos? Oh well. I probably meant to do it. Creates an interesting new dynamic, don't you think?\" </p> <p>Maybe the power's gone to his head. But speculating over the nature of his next leering decree or outrageous gaffe is going some way towards filling the aching void that Nick Bateman left in his wake.</p>",
  "It might have been the funeral of a renowned actor, or a politician, given the 300-odd mourners outside the church, the cordoned-off roads, the bechained dignitaries, and the massed ranks of press. <p>But when the cortege, headed by a gleaming Victorian coach and four plumed horses, drew up at the village church of St Peter's in Hersham, Surrey, yesterday, it almost seemed as if they were mourning someone too young to be famous. </p> <p>The white coffin was barely four feet long, and the floral wreaths above the carriage spelt out two words now synonymous with one little girl: \"Sarah\" and \"Princess\". They were there to bury Sarah Payne, the eight-year-old snatched from a country lane behind her grandparents' home in Kingston, west Sussex, two months ago. </p> <p>Inside the packed church Sara and Michael Payne, both 31, together with their children Lee, 13, Luke, 11, and six-year-old Charlotte, grieved for the daughter they had called their \"little princess\", and mourned, in the words of the parish priest Nick Whitehead, her \"much too early death\". </p> <p>As villagers listened to the service, relayed outside on loudspeakers, the vicar, Sarah's mother, and a former teacher recalled the loving, feisty, and sometimes bossy schoolgirl. Struggling to hold back the tears, and at times breaking down, Mrs Payne read out a letter she had written to her daughter. </p> <p>\"Ever since you came bounding into our lives at two in the morning with ... one tooth in your head and a smile that could melt ice, we loved you,\" she said, to rapt silence. </p> <p> She went on: \"As a sister, you were great. You were a pain when you were supposed to be, and a great friend whenever needed. Lee misses your top chats, Charlotte, she misses you - your stories, your songs, your games, and most of all your huggles. </p> <p>\"As a daughter, my darling, you were perfect. I will always, always love you. Love always and forever, Mummy and Daddy.\" </p> <p>Her former teacher at Burhill primary school, June Whittle, was close to tears as she recalled a \"very special little girl\", who would dash into her mother's arms at the end of each day and skip off. </p> <p>The vicar, who recalled Sarah visiting the church with her school, spoke of her \"sensitive bossiness\". But he also referred to her traumatised siblings, who were were playing with her minutes before she was snatched on July 1, in Kingston, west Sussex. \"Above all, allow [them] to be themselves,\" he urged the congregation. \"Care for them and treat them as normally as possible.\" </p> <p>As the small coffin, carried by four pall-bearers, left the church for a private burial, the impossibility of a \"normal\" existence for the Payne family was all too apparent. Mr Payne clung to his wife while Charlotte clutched her arm with both hands, and the boys stood helplessly by. </p> <p>For Sussex police, now pinning their hopes on finding Sarah's blue polo dress, it was a scene that leant further impetus to their inquiries. </p> <p>\"It's impossible for us not to be emotionally involved,\" said Detective Superintendent Alan Ladley, three of whose officers joined the 21 members of the Payne family in the procession behind the cortege, at their request.</p>",
  "As the chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, paid his respects yesterday to the immigrant whose murder ignited an international scandal about Germany's neo-Nazi right, it emerged that the dead man's widow had fled her home in fear of her life and was living in hiding under police protection. <p>Three young men set upon the Mozambique-born Alberto Adriano in a park in the eastern city of Dessau on June 11 and kicked him for so long and so hard that he died from his injuries three days later. </p> <p>His murder helped jolt Germany's political leaders into a new assessment of the threat posed by the extreme right. </p> <p>Adriano's German-born wife Angelika was not in court on Wednesday for the sentencing of her husband's murderers. The eldest of the three racist thugs who attacked him was given a life sentence. His two 16-year-old accomplices got nine years each. </p> <p>John Greene, an American who represents an anti-discrimination group in Dessau, said yesterday that Ms Adriano left her home on Saturday. \"I know that she planned it after receiving threatening telephone calls. Then a letter came threatening her life and the lives of her children,\" he said. </p> <p>A leader of the immigrant community in Dessau said the writer of the letter had threatened to blow up the flat she shares with her three children, the youngest of whom is six months old. </p> <p>The letter also abused her for having married an African and said her children would be infected with Aids as a result. </p> <p>Against a background of spreading European concern about the far right, Mr Schr\u00f6der was joined yesterday by the Finnish prime minister, Paavo Lipponen, on a visit to Dessau. The visit was intended to highlight the German government's determination to curb neo-Nazism. </p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der laid a wreath of yellow flowers at the little monument which local officials have erected at the site of the murder. But, astonishingly, no arrangements were made for the chancellor to meet Mrs Adriano. </p> <p>Nor did he have any but the most fleeting contact with those working against racism in the city: he shook hands with the head of the city's multi-cultural institute. </p> <p>Nobody doubts his determination to tackle far-right violence, but he will have his hands full: xenophobia seems to be entrenched in many regions of Germany, particularly in the east. </p> <p>Heinz Wolf, a retired man, who watched Mr Schr\u00f6der lay his tribute of flowers, said he had little respect for the gesture. </p> <p>\"This won't change anything,\" he said.\"Why do we bring so many foreigners here when we have enough problems ourselves?\" </p> <p>Today Mr Schr\u00f6der will reach the end of a marathon tour of eastern Germany which has been dominated by the issue of far-right violence. Yet not a single meeting with race-relations workers has figured on his itinerary. </p> <p>Nor is there any evidence of his having discussed the issue with members of the immigrant community. </p> <p>As he visited Dessau, a new race row erupted in the state parliament in Hesse, the region which includes Frankfurt. </p> <p>The local leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) made a formal apology after Green party members claimed that a Christian Democrat MP had told a foreign-born Green MP to go back where he came from. </p> <p>They said that during a heated debate Tarek al-Wazir, who has German citizenship and a Yemeni father, was told to \"go back to Sana'a\". </p> <p>CDU members said that the phrase had been misheard, but the leader of their parliamentary group made an unconditional apology. </p> <p>Elsewhere, police in the eastern town of Cottbus reported that a group of youths shouting \"Sieg Heil\" and giving the Nazi salute had tossed two crude Molotov cocktails on to the footbpath in front of a building housing a youth club called \"Multi-cultural Europe\". There were no injuries and no damage. </p> <p>Near Stuttgart, in south-west Germany, three skinheads, ages 18 to 21, faced charges after confessing to lighting a fire in a home for asylum seekers on Wednesday. Two of the 79 residents were slightly injuring during the evacuation.</p>"
