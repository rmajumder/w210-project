  "The Metropolitan police were embroiled in another extraordinary race row yesterday when one of the force's most senior officers pointedly refused to apologise to a Sikh sergeant cleared by an employment tribunal of sending race hate mail to colleagues. <p>Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Grieve, the head of Scotland Yard's racial and violent crimes task force, insisted it would not be appropriate to apologise to Gurpal Virdi, 41, when there were further hearings on his case in the pipeline. The tribunal found no evidence for the allegations that he sent the hate mail because he had been passed over for promotion. It also found he was the victim of racial discrimination during the inquiry. </p> <p>The refusal to say sorry was condemned by Mr Virdi and by members of the Met's independent advisory group (IAG), which described his treatment by the force as \"disgraceful\", \"appalling\" and \"a disaster\". </p> <p>It now seems inevitable that Mr Virdi will receive a big settlement, possibly exceeding the \u00a31m paid in June to Det Con Sarah Locker, who sued for sexual and racial discrimination. </p> <p>The Virdi case is undermining the Met's race relations strategy at a time when the force is desperate to show that it has changed fundamentally since the Macpherson report into the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation was published last year. </p> <p>Mr Virdi was sacked in March after an internal disciplinary panel of three senior officers ruled that he had sent racist hate mail to himself and other black and Asian staff at Ealing and Hanwell police stations, west London, in December 1997 and January 1998. </p> <p>One of the letters read: \"Not wanted. Keep the police force white. Leave now or else.\" It was signed NF. </p> <p>Scotland Yard's complaints investigation branch discovered that the letters had been written on Mr Virdi's computer. During a raid at his house, officers found envelopes identical to the ones used to post the letters. </p> <p>Mr Virdi, who had an unblemished record in 16 years of service, has consistently denied the charges. </p> <p>He claimed he was not at the station when the letters were written and believes he was set up because he challenged white officers who he thought were apathetic about racially motivated crimes. </p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, he said the idea that he had sent the letters because he had been overlooked for promotion was \"ridiculous\". </p> <p>Backed by the commission for racial equality, he took his case to an employment tribunal which ruled two weeks ago that he had been treated differently to a white female officer, PC Jackie Bachelor, who was also a suspect in the investigation. </p> <p>It condemned a six-hour search of Mr Virdi's home by an anti-terrorist squad and claimed the Met attempted to entrap him in a taped interview in February 1998. </p> <p>Yesterday, the IAG, set up in January 1999 to review the Met's handling of racist crime, heaped more embarrassment on the force with its own review of the Virdi case. </p> <p>It said the Met had conducted \"a disgraceful investigation and high-profile character assassination\". </p> <p>It said the inquiry had been flawed and biased and concluded that the verdict of the Met's disciplinary panel was unsafe. </p> <p>An appeal against Mr Virdi's dismissal has been launched and a second employment tribunal will meet in October to consider whether he was unfairly sacked. </p> <p>During a tense press conference at Scotland Yard yesterday, members of the IAG said Mr Virdi deserved a public apology for \"the horrendous experience he and his family had been put through\" and demanded that the officers responsible for his victimisation should be brought to account. </p> <p>But when Mr Grieve spoke on behalf of the police, he said: \"Am I going to apologise? The answer is no.\" </p> <p>He added: \"I have deep sympathy with the situation he finds himself in but it is not appropriate to apologise part way through a legal process.\" </p> <p>Mr Virdi, who was sitting in front of Mr Grieve during the press conference, said the commissioner's remarks were typical of the attitude of senior officers at the Met. </p> <p>\"This is not about money, it never has been. I want justice and I intend to fight to clear my name. I don't think they have learned anything since Macpherson. </p> <p>\"They will take a long time to do so. I was convicted by a kangaroo court and cleared by a proper tribunal.\" </p> <p>Mike Franklin, the advisory group's vice-chairman, added: \"It is unfortunate Mr Grieve cannot say he regrets what has happened. This is the worst case I have ever seen involving race discrimination and a serving police officer.\" </p> <p>Ian Blair, Scotland Yard's deputy commissioner, said the Metropolitan police authority, which oversees the force, would also be conducting a review of the \"complex and difficult\" case. \"We respect the views that the IAG are putting forward, but we do not necessarily agree with them.\"</p>"
