  "Clare Short, the international development secretary, clashed with government policy yesterday when she warned the NHS not to poach highly trained staff from the poorest countries to cover skill shortages. <p>Her call was also an indirect criticism of the education secretary, David Blunkett, who is planning to relax work permits to lure computer operators from developing countries. </p> <p>Ms Short was speaking during Commons question time after the Tory MP Andrew Rowe accused the NHS of trying to employ qualified nurses from poverty-stricken sub-Saharan Africa. </p> <p>He asked: \"Do you not find it almost obscene that one of the richest countries in the world should be sending teams to sub-Saharan Africa to recruit nurses for the NHS when they should be left in the countries [where] they have been trained?\" </p> <p>Ms Short replied: \"I very much agree with your fundamental point, that when countries like us and many others say we have skill shortages and we want to recruit internationally - and it is good for people internationally to share their skills and travel to each other's countries - we should not be recruiting highly skilled and expensively trained people from some of the poorest countries.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for the NHS said it was not responsible for individual recruitment campaigns run by health authorities and trusts. National guidelines on recruiting staff from abroad had been sent to them. </p> <p>The Department for Education and Employment announced this month that foreign nationals might soon be allowed in to look for jobs and then seek a work permit.</p>"
