  "<p>Tax, capital punishment, healthcare - all important, but the real indication of the most suitable man for the White House was this week provided by <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/ew/\">Entertainment Weekly</a> when it asked three of the presidential candidates about their favoured forms of entertainment.</p> <p>On the subject of their favourite movie, the threesome differed wildly, both in terms of how discerning their tastes and how often they appeared to catch a movie. Democrat Al Gore opted for Spike Jonze's skittish take on fame, <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0120601\">Being John Malkovich</a> (pictured); Republican George W Bush plumped for populist crowd-pleaser <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0118655\">Austin Powers</a>; and Reform candidate Pat Buchanan, perhaps insecurely, selected the jingoistic <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0187393\">The Patriot</a>.</p> <p>As for favourite actors, Gore chose the sphinx-like <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Jones,+Tommy+Lee\">Tommy Lee Jones</a>, George W Bush went for the eternally roguish <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Nicholson,+Jack\">Jack Nicholson</a> and Pat Buchanan digged all-round-nice-guy and bringer of salad seasoning to the masses <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Newman,+Paul\">Paul Newman</a>.</p> <p>Telling choices continued in the other categories with Gore revealing his fondness for Stendhal's saga of personal ambition Scarlet and Black for favourite book, Bush hawking his Everyman credentials once again with the news that there's always a place in his heart for Baseball Tonight (favourite TV programme) and Pat Buchanan letting slip his hankering for the music of Patsy Cline.</p> <p>The full list can be seen at <a href=\"http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=\" 7350\"\">Ain't It Cool</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Boots, the high street pharmacy chain, yesterday talked of a further round of redundancies after announcing plans to cut costs by \u00a3100m over the next two years. </p> <p>Senior management figures are looking at departments which can save money, and are expected to announce concrete proposals early next year. </p> <p>David Thompson, deputy chief executive and finance director, insisted the move - which follows the 1,000 job cuts in the chemist chain - was vital to allow future investment in current stores. </p> <p>\"We have to be efficient and drive the business forward,\" he said. \"I imagine there will be some job losses, but we are not able to say how many. Much of these savings will be made by lowering our costs from suppliers.\" The past year has seen the Boots share price in virtual freefall, and with every decline comes a flurry of speculation over potential bidders. </p> <p>Analysts say investor confidence has been damaged by the perceived threat from grocers, while the group itself is pinning hopes on services such as dentistry, opticians and health clubs. </p> <p>The company has also been looking to expand product ranges and pledged to continue looking abroad to source more unusual brand products. </p> <p>Mr Thompson denied any approaches had been received, but admitted the company needed to be on its guard to stay independent. </p> <p>\"We just have to improve the business. The only defence we have against predators is our performance.\" Analysts suggest the group's real value is in its break-up potential with Halfords, the car and bike accessory chain, a key target. </p> <p>Yesterday Boots reported slow progress at the half-year stage which undermined the recent share price rebound. </p> <p>The company branded some of its markets \"sluggish\" and pointed out the period was impacted by the withdrawal from leisure merchandise. </p> <p>Pre-tax profits for the group, excluding exceptionals, crawled up 2.3% to \u00a3271.3m on the back of a 1.3% turnover increase at \u00a32.5bn. The basic earnings per share was up 3.4% to 21.5p, and the interim dividend advanced 4% to 7.8p. </p> <p>Among the best performing divisions was Boots Healthcare International, which recently bought the Clearasil brand for \u00a3233m as pre-tax profits surged 70% to \u00a325m. </p> <p>Overseas, the company's sales reached almost \u00a320m and expects to hit profits in Thailand next year. The figures failed to ignite the City, however, with the company's share price falling 24.5p, just over 4%, to 536.5p last night. </p> <p>\"The message coming out of the company leads me to think achieving sales growth is going to remain difficult,\" commented one analyst. </p> <p>The company's interim figures came as the British Retail Consortium said supermarket competition had pushed down prices in the shops over the past month. The consortium's monthly Shop Price Index showed prices falling by 0.5% during October, which it said was a result of competition between the big food retailers. </p> <p>Seasonal products, such as apples, were deemed more expensive, while the reductions on groceries and fish as well as non-food goods meant prices fell overall. </p> <p>Over the year, retailers were still seeing price deflation, with shop price inflation running at minus 0.2%, said the BRC. </p> <p>Bill Moyes, BRC director general, said: \"Prices have fallen once more, compared with a year earlier, after a brief upward blip during September. </p> <p>\"Prices have been lower in 17 out of 18 months and shoppers are still paying less than they were two years ago.\"</p>"
