  "<p>Nasdaq, the US hi-tech stock market, has ruled out bidding for the London Stock Exchange which yesterday abandoned its unpopular merger with the City's German rival. </p> <p>Sources close to Nasdaq, which had been cited as a potential \"white knight\" to rescue London from the clutches of OM of Sweden, said yesterday that the US exchange would press for a \"pan-European transatlantic partnership\". It may, however, be prepared to back a bid by a wider range of European exchanges for London. </p> <p>Confusion about the future of the 200-year-old London exchange mounted last night when Don Cruickshank, the chairman, said that he would talk to anyone about a potential bid. Mr Cruickshank insisted he would \"see off\" the \u00a3808m offer by OM and carve an alternative route to the creation of a pan-European stock exchange in which London would play a leading role. </p> <p>He said that to put up a credible defence the London exchange needed to withdraw its merger plan with the Deutsche B\u00f6rse in Frankfurt - which might yet mount its own bid for the London exchange. </p> <p>\"London is going to take the initiative,\" Mr Cruickshank said, indicating that he would resume talks with the Germans if OM's bid was defeated. </p> <p>Failure to cement the German merger continues to deny Mr Cruickshank and his fellow directors stock options linked to the deal. The exchange's shares yesterday closed just below \u00a330, almost double the level at which they started traded a month ago. </p> <p>The chairman of OM, the owner of the Stockholm exchange which derailed the plan by bidding for London, stands to increase his bonus by \u00a3500,000 a year if the audacious ploy is successful. </p> <p>According to the OM offer document posted to shareholders in the London exchange yesterday, Olof Stenhammar, the chairman, has a profit-related deal under which he receives 1% of the group's income. This would grow by \u00a350m if OM took over the London exchange. </p> <p>The decision by the London exchange to end its merger with the Deutsche B\u00f6rse clears the way for the Frankfurt institution to launch its own bid for London, a move which was not ruled out in some City circles last night. Other potential bidders were cited as Euronext, the exchange made up of the Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels bourses, or Liffe, the London International Financial Futures Exchange, which last night ruled out such a move. </p> <p>The Deutsche B\u00f6rse was understood to be disappointed by London's decision to pull out. Its chief executive, Werner Seifert, said he would \"examine alternative action\". </p> <p>Smaller stockbrokers greeted the London exchange's decision with relief. Brian Winterflood, chairman of Winterflood Securities which has staged a vocal anti-merger campaign, said the London exchange now had its work cut out to \"rebuild a lot of bridges\". </p> <p>The London exchange is expected to use tomorrow's annual general meeting to set out its new strategic course. </p> <p><br><strong>Changing tune</strong></p> <p> \"The iX proposals are driven not by politics or patriotism but by hard-headed business logic ... there will be more choice for investors and more investors for companies\"</p> <p>Don Cruickshank, Sept 4 </p> <p>\"A bog-standard, medium-sized hostile takeover bid\"</p> <p>Don Cruickshank on the OM bid, Sept 2 </p> <p>\"I am really quite confident that the vote will go through, which means the merger will be completed by November ...\"</p> <p>Don Cruickshank, Aug 11 </p> <p>\"It is good news that the fragmentation and bickering about who is going to be champion of Europe is going away\"</p> <p>Investment banker, May 4 </p>",
  "<p>The states of America are united by at least one characteristic: an obsession with race. White suburbanites bemoan the loss of their cities to crime, drugs and - by extension - black neighbourhoods. When they say, \"It's a jungle down there\", you're supposed to know what they mean. Black community leaders wonder out loud why the shops in their areas are owned by recently arrived Koreans. US cities are divided cleanly along ethnic axes - an enduring American apartheid. </p> <p>George W Bush put almost all the black members of the Republican party on the stage at his convention to prove his open-mindedness. Al Gore argues that there needs to be a greater national awareness of racism before any progress is possible. </p> <p>Actually, the awareness of race as an issue could not be higher. What might be needed, conversely, is to take the race issue down the agenda - and take some of the political heat out of a debate which has become distorted by party political point-scoring, white guilt and overzealous legal action. </p> <p>Nowhere is a new approach more needed than in the workplace. Racism in any form stains the working environment, and has to be stamped out. But hypersensitivity about colour or religious affiliation can be counterproductive. A friend of mine is a senior civil servant in the US government. He is an ultra-progressive, humane, open-minded white man. (Oh, and he's gay. In America, where group membership is minutely calibrated, that probably matters). He is currently under investigation for anti-semitic and racist behaviour. </p> <p>A Jewish woman has accused him of overlooking her for a position because of her faith. The process entails interviews with equal opportunities officers and rigorous questioning of his own beliefs. The fact that he was unaware she was Jewish makes no difference. And an African-American man has accused him of racism after being suspended for sexual harassment. (This is where workplace politics get really sticky.) The man in question placed his hand on a female colleague's bottom and squeezed, in full view of a dozen people, in the office canteen. (Oh, she's black, too. In America that definitely matters.) </p> <p>US managers say that it is many more times more difficult to fire, discipline or warn a non-white employee for fear of lawsuits and bad PR. This is crazy. An equal society is one in which people are treated on the basis of their abilities and effort, not colour or creed. This must work both ways - in firing as well as hiring. Otherwise, firms will be reluctant to hire people from ethnic minorities in the first place - not because they are racist, but because they are afraid of being labelled as such if the recruit is not up to the job and has to be dismissed. </p> <p>The problem is that a whole industry of lawyers, lobbyists, politicians, equal opportunities officers and human resources specialists has been built on the premise that US citizens are incapable of acting in an enlightened fashion. And few are prepared to take this lobby on, for fear of being accused of racism themselves. </p> <p>None of which is to say that racism is over and done with. Far from it. Or that there should not be the strictest sanctions for those who act in discriminatory ways. But America needs a dose of the optimism about human nature enshrined in its constitution, and echoed by leaders such as Martin Luther King. Real racism is bad enough: there's no need to see it lurking everywhere. </p> <p> Strangely, there is one form of prejudice that the US endorses enthusiastically - ageism. At a conference in New York last week, the convenor asked all the \"young people, whose enthusiasm, energy and ability to think outside the box are so needed\" to stand up. This being America, a few dozen eager youths leapt to their feet to receive a ripple of applause. At a stroke the convenor therefore insulted anybody not defined as \"young\" and patronised those who were. </p> <p>In a separate session, a speaker invited his 12-year-old son, who spent the entire time playing a handheld computer game (and it was difficult to blame him), to tell the audience about his concerns for the future. On hearing his name, the young man in question looked up, startled, and said: \"Well, if an asteroid hit us, that would be really really bad, wouldn't it?\" At times like this, an asteroid strike seems like the least we deserve. </p> <p>\u0095 Richard Reeves is director of futures at the Industrial Society.

  "A murderer serving life for battering a pensioner to death with a hammer has been removed from rehabilitation work in an old people's home, the Home Office said yesterday. <p>The move followed criticism from Age Concern and Victim Support, but was yesterday described by his wife as \"absolutely ridiculous\". </p> <p>Brian Parsons, 40, is serving life in Ford open prison, near Arundel, West Sussex, for the 1987 murder of Ivy Batten, 84, at her home in Shute Bottom, Devon. </p> <p>Parsons was due yesterday to start work at a home near the prison as part of his rehabilitation, carrying out odd jobs. But when news of the placement emerged it was criticised as \"insensitive\" by a Devon pensioners' group, and Age Concern believed the prison authorities should reconsider. </p> <p>A prison service spokesman said that Parsons, from Colyton, Devon, would be found other outside work. </p> <p>Press Association</p>"
