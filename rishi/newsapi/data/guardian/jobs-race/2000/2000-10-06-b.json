  "<p>EMI and Time Warner are working frantically to resurrect their \u00a313.7bn joint venture by the end of the year after European regulators yesterday confirmed that the concessions proposed to address competition concerns were inadequate. </p> <p>The companies said they were still committed to a plan that would create the world's largest music group, however. </p> <p>They withdrew their original proposals yesterday morning ahead of a European commission meeting which was set to block the deal. By doing so they believe they have given themselves time to work on a solution that would appease the commission. </p> <p>It is understood EMI hopes to update investors at its interim results meeting, scheduled for November 21. </p> <p>EMI shares fell 31.5p to 528p as weeks of horsetrading ended in failure and analysts struggled to see a way forward for the group. </p> <p>Some suggested the last-minute concessions the firms had offered had been too little and too late, and could leave EMI exposed to a counterbid. Disney, Sony, News Corpand Bertelsmann were possible predators, analysts said. </p> <p>Others believe that the EC's intansigence all but rules out a counterbid from another big record company. </p> <p>The fact that the link-up is dead in its present form means that the EC is now far more likely to clear America Online's \u00a380bn merger with Time Warner - which it is considering separately. </p> <p>It had feared that the merged entity would enjoy a dominant position in the markets for online music delivery and music software, but the collapse of the EMI deal appears to go a long way to removing these concerns. </p> <p>Officials in Brussels confirmed that the EC had been poised to block the EMI-Time Warner deal because it believed it would be anti-competitive and against consumers' interests. </p> <p>The tie-up would have left 80% of Europe's recorded music business in the hands of four multinationals and brought greater pressure to bear on small independent labels, the EC believed. </p> <p>The EMI-Time Warner behemoth would have boasted of roster of international stars including David Bowie, Madonna, the Beatles and Eric Clapton. In an effort to ensure the deal was cleared the two firms are said to have offered to dispose of Virgin Records and Chappell Music Publishing, but only after Brussels' strict deadline for remedies had passed. </p> <p>Eric Nicoli, chairman of EMI, said: \"The withdrawal of our applications allows additional time to reassess regulators' concerns and pursue solutions in Europe and the US. We have been, and will continue to be, flexible in responding to the EC's concerns. </p> <p>\"We continue to believe that a venture with Warner Music Group can create substantial value for our shareholders and benefit our artists, consumers and employees by bringing together two companies with complementary strengths.\" </p> <p>The EC acknowledged that that the tentative concessions proposed over recent days had \"improved substantially the initial remedies\", but said EMI and Warner had simply run out of time. </p> <p>\"It's very dangerous to leave your undertakings to the last minute because it leaves very little time for the EC to consider them,\" said EC spokeswoman Amelia Torres.</p>"
