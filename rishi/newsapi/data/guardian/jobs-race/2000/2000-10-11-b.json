  "<p>Reuters faces an embarrassing lawsuit in which two senior managers could be subpoenaed to appear as witnesses in a case accusing the company of sexual discrimination and bullying.</p> <p>The case will also raise questions about Reuters' internet strategy.</p> <p>A hearing will be held tomorrow, at which it will be decided whether Reuters chief executive officer Peter Job and ITN chairman Mark Wood are to be called as hostile witnesses at the tribunal.</p> <p>Former Reuters journalists Kim Usher and Jonathan Birt are suing the company for unfair dismissal after a Reuters subsidiary internet project, called Project Sunrise, was canned earlier this year.</p> <p>Ms Usher and Mr Birt will argue that Reuters failed to give them adequate notice that their jobs were at risk, and then failed to give them jobs in the company that matched their salary levels.</p> <p>Ms Usher will also claim she was a victim of sexual discrimination, and will give evidence suggesting female journalists and managers have suffered from a masculine culture. Reuters has no women on its 12-strong board.</p> <p>The case will also put Reuters' internet strategy under the spotlight. Slower to materialise than many of its rivals' strategies, it has faced criticism from many sections of the industry. </p> <p>Instinet, the retail service of Reuters' global internet brokerage, has been delayed by technical hitches. </p> <p>The company was this morning one of the biggest casualties in the wave of uncertainty sweeping the technology sector. Shares tumbled 6.8%, or 172p, to 1091p in early trading. </p> <p>Reuters declined to comment on the legal case.</p>"
