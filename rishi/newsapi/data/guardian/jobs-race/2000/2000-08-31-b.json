  "<p>Corus, Europe's largest steel group, yesterday announced a \u00a335m plan to secure the future of its Llanwern plant in south Wales but warned that the project could be aborted at any time. </p> <p>The group said it had agreed in principle to reline the plant's No 3 blast furnace and that contractual discussions with suppliers of materials and services would start shortly. </p> <p>But it added that the project, due to be completed in September next year, would be subject to continuous review to ensure that it remained in the group's wider interest. </p> <p>Union officials had warned that failure to reline the furnace, which can produce up to 41,000 tonnes of steel a week, could lead the the closure of the whole plant and the loss of 3,000 jobs. </p> <p>Nick Cragg, managing director of Corus Strip Products, said: \"Corus continues to face difficult trading conditions in the UK, sterling remains strong and market pressures are increasing. </p> <p>\"In these circumstances, it is difficult to take a very long-term view, especially on a multi-million pound investment and hence the need for the ongoing review.\" </p> <p>Corus has been struggling to cope with the strong pound on its British plants. It has already announced plans to axe nearly 4,000 jobs in Britain, including 450 at Llanwern. </p> <p>Officials of the ISTC steel union said yesterday's announcement reaffirmed the company's faith in Welsh steelmaking and had \"lifted a cloud of doom from Llanwern\". </p> <p>Michael Leahy, the ISTC general secretary, backed calls by Corus's chief executive, John Bryant, for government help over the strong pound and high electricity prices. </p> <p>He said: \"We do understand Corus when it says the decision is subject to the ongoing review of their business. But this decision is a very positive step forward.\" </p> <p>But union and political celebrations could be premature. Corus also said that the Llanwern works would have to achieve \"a more competitive cost base\" if its current plant configuration was to continue. </p> <p>Business and political leaders in Wales welcomed the announcement but recognised that more remained to be done to persuade the steel maker to commit itself to the long-term future of the plant.</p>",
  "Al Gore and George W Bush have become locked in an increasingly acrimonious debate about debates, with the two White House contenders jockeying for advantage over the format of their televised confrontations this autumn. <p>In an attempt to break with the traditional televised set-up, the Republican candidate, Mr Bush, is pressing for the debates to have a more informal, round-table character, moderated by hosts who he hopes will adopt a softer, more conversational approach. </p> <p>The Bush camp would like at least one, and possibly more, of the debates to be modelled on a session which took place during the Republican primary race earlier this year, in which the rival contenders were interviewed around a table by CNN's Larry King. Mr Bush said this week that such debates were \"more free flowing\". </p> <p>But the Democrat nominee, Mr Gore, has already accepted a plan put forward by a neutral commission for three debates in October along traditional lines, with the two men standing at lecterns and being grilled by senior political reporters. </p> <p>Mr Gore has also said repeatedly that he will debate with his rival \"any time, anywhere, any place\", though whether he would actually do so is likely to depend on Mr Bush's willingness to agree to the prime-time network events as well. </p> <p>Such debates about debates are not new in American presidential elections, but the Gore-Bush argument has come earlier than usual and reflects the immense stakes which both camps have in the outcome of this year's televised head-to-head sessions. </p> <p>With most of the opinion polls now showing the White House race to be a close one, both men see the debates as one of the few major opportunities to shift voters' minds in the run-up to the November 7 election. </p> <p>As a result, the Gore and Bush camps are both desperate to ensure that their opponent does not get an inbuilt advantage from the way the debates are structured and conducted. Mr Gore's camp believes that its man will outshine Mr Bush in high-profile debates, while Mr Bush's handling of the argument suggests that he fears Mr Gore could be right. </p> <p>At this stage of the campaign the two men only agree on two things - that there will be presidential debates of some description this autumn, and that only Mr Bush and Mr Gore will take part in them. </p> <p>The two main candidates both oppose any efforts by the Reform party's Pat Buchanan or the Green party nominee, Ralph Nader, to be included in the debates. </p> <p>Earlier this year, the independent Commission on Presidential Debates, a bipartisan group which has sponsored nationally televised presidential debates in each of the last three American elections, put forward proposals for three debates between the presidential nominees and one debate between the vice-presidential candidates. </p> <p>They would take place between October 3 and 17 and all four would be broadcast by the three major US networks - ABC, CBS and NBC. </p> <p>Mr Gore accepted the commission's proposals this week and also agreed to a suggestion from the Bush camp for a second televised match-up between Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman, the vice- presidential nominees. </p> <p>Mr Bush's reluctance to make the same commitment prompted a barrage of attacks from the Gore camp. \"George Bush is trying to do everything he can to avoid prime-time presidential debates that will be seen on all three networks,\" a spokesman Mark Fabiani said. </p> <p>Such attacks riled Mr Bush. \"Who said we don't want prime-time exposure?\" he retorted at a meeting with reporters on his campaign plane. Mr Bush said he would \"pick and choose\" the venues, formats and ground rules for the debates.</p>",
  "Three young neo-Nazis were yesterday convicted of a vicious race murder, in a case that has brought to a head the German government's concern over the far right's activities in the east of the country. <p>The widow of their victim, Mozambique-born Alberto Adriano, stayed away from the hearing at a court in the eastern city of Halle after receiving a death threat. </p> <p>The court sentenced Enrico Hilprecht, 24, to the maximum of life in prison. His two 16-year-old co-defendants, Christian Richter and Frank Miethbauer, were each given nine years in jail, one year less than the maximum sentence for juveniles. </p> <p>The judge called the deadly assault on June 11 \"the latest in a long chain of attacks to which we must put an end\". </p> <p>Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, called yesterday for the speedy imposition of a ban on the radical far-right National Democratic party of Germany (NPD). The government has moved gradually towards supporting a ban, despite the misgivings of its interior minister, Otto Schily. </p> <p>Critics, including senior officials in the counter-intelligence service, have argued that such a ban would merely make surveillance of the neo-Nazi scene more difficult. </p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der will today lay a wreath at a memorial erected at the spot where Adriano was attacked so savagely that he later died of his wounds. The killing was the third this year alleged to have been carried out by members of the far right. </p> <p>The court was told that the younger defendants had previous convictions for daubing swastikas. </p> <p>Tolerance of neo-Nazi violence is widespread in eastern Germany, especially among the young. In an effort to end this tolerance, the chancellor yesterday appealed to east Germans' pride in their recent history, encouraging them to take a stand like the one that put an end to communist rule in 1989. </p> <p>He said Germany needed a \"repeat of what people in the east of our country recognised in the peaceful revolution 10 years ago\", adding that the easterners had to \"involve themselves and fight for the right thing\". </p> <p>In Dessau, where Adriano was killed, police said his German-born widow had received a threatening letter which the public prosecutor's office was investigating. A spokesman for a foreigners' rights group said she had decided not to attend the final session of the court because she was \"simply too scared because of her children\". </p> <p>Mr Adriano, who was 39 and worked in a meat packing plant, left behind him three children, of whom the youngest is six months old. </p> <p>His killers yesterday sat expressionless in court yesterday as the verdict was read out. </p> <p>The defence had pleaded for shorter jail terms and for manslaughter or deadly assault charges, saying prosecutors had failed to prove that the attackers intended to kill Adriano when they set on him in a park after a drunken rampage through the city. </p> <p>A defence lawyer, Sabine Grunow, said all of the accused expressed regret in brief closing statements at the end of the four-day trial. Hearings were closed to the public because of German law regarding juveniles. </p> <p>Adriano was walking home in the early hours of the morning, when the three attacked him, screaming racist abuse. When they had kicked him unconscious, they stripped him of his clothes as a final humiliation. </p> <p>In a further instance of racist violence, prosecutors in the northern town of L\u00fcbeck said they had arrested two skinheads for attacking and injuring a 33-year-old African man whom they had taunted with racial slurs. </p> <p>Police in the German town of Waiblingen detained two men after two foreigners were slightly injured in an early-morning arson attack on a home for asylum seekers. </p> <p>Late on Tuesday, a 21-year-old German man was given a five-month suspended sentence and fined 500DM (\u00a3160) for punching a Hong Kong-born photojournalist who was trying to cover racism in the east.</p>"
