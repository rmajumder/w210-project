  "<p>Back in the days of supporter innocence, when managers in sheepskin coats were revered as saintly figures, the barometer that indicated their popularity was the letters page in the local 'pink un. </p> <p>It still happens, of course. The Liverpool Echo's Saturday night sports edition remains essential reading for those absorbed by others' afflictions. </p> <p>But in these days of electronic communication, the Internet possibly carries the greater threat to a down-on-his-luck manager. On Wednesday night, within minutes of Everton's Keatonesque exit from the Worthington Cup, a wide variety of forums and sites devoted to matters of a royal-blue hue - notably the admirable Toffeeweb - were flooded with the outpourings of the angry and the downright confused. The unthinkable had happened and the calls for the dismissal of Walter Smith were only to be expected. </p> <p>Like his Manchester City counterpart, the average Everton punter is a remarkable animal. Masochistic, sustained by blind faith and imbued with the belief that something better will turn up, those who regularly fill Goodison Park are to be admired; the real heroes, at a club marooned in a period of transition for most of a decade, wear scarves not shorts. </p> <p>Irrespective of whether he ultimately succeeds in pushing Everton around the corner, Smith has already won a place in the hearts of most of his club's followers simply because he is perceived as the man who pointed the former chairman Peter Johnson towards Goodison's door and then applied a size-10 boot. </p> <p>In truth, removing the amiable and largely misunderstood Johnson from office was not that difficult. He had had enough of the abuse and he was capable of recognising a fast-fading dream. </p> <p>But on Saturday evening, as the jeers rolled down from cheap and expensive seats alike, Smith must have reflected on the old theory that popularity is a transient thing in sport. He must have felt embarrassed, too, for his team had just delivered a performance which was clueless, guileless and above all else careless. </p> <p>Simply by playing simple, orderly football bereft of pretension, Ipswich Town shredded first Everton's midfield, then their defence and finally their confidence. </p> <p>\"If you give away goals as we did, you deserve to lose,\" observed Smith. And lose they did - by some distance and with some ease. </p> <p>With players absent injured and far too many of those present asked to undertake alien roles, Everton were beaten from the moment John McGreal's header from a Jim Magilton free-kick found its way home on 19 minutes. </p> <p>Thereafter it was simply a question of how many more times Ipswich would pierce a defence which, ludicrously, featured the midfielder Alex Nyarko as its main plank. </p> <p>In the end George Burley's side settled for just a couple, Marcus Stewart showing true predatory instinct to convert smartly after first Steve Watson and then David Unsworth committed wretched, unforced blunders. </p> <p>\"The bookies keep telling me we'll be relegated but I think we have a decent little side,\" said Burley. Spot on. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "As fireworks exploded all around her and the most successful games ever came to a close, the woman charged with staging the next one was still doing her best to reassure us that Athens could match Australia. <p>\"We invited the Olympics to come back home,\" said Gianna Angelopoulous-Daskalaki, the head of the Athens organising committee. \"We promised to provide the best environment for the games. We will keep our word.\" </p> <p>But after three years of delays, Athens has fallen so far behind in Olympic preparations that serious questions are being raised within the International Olympic Committee about whether the 2004 games should be moved. </p> <p>The biggest concern has been over construction. Athens claims 70% of the sports venues are in place - but they claimed that three years ago. Completing the other 30%, including the Olympic village, remains a problem. </p> <p>In Sydney, there has already been talk behind the scenes of who might stage the games should Athens not be able to. </p> <p>\"There is no plan B,\" said Francois Carrard, the director general of the IOC. \"The IOC is absolutely committed to seeing an excellent games in Athens.\" </p> <p>Last March, the IOC president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, described Athens as facing the worst crisis in his 20-year term. He said Athens was stuck on the \"amber light\" and slipping toward the \"red light\" danger zone. </p> <p>All sides agree that significant progress has been made since the appointment of Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, a 45-year-old former MP and wife of the wealthy shipping magnate Theodore Angelopoulos. </p> <p>She has brought in her own team and begun cutting through the bureaucratic tangle, while premier Costas Simitis has assumed governmental responsibility for the games. </p> <p>The Athens organising committee has a budget of $1.7bn, while the government has committed a total of $3.2bn to games-related projects.</p>"
