  "It began as just another row about funding for the arts, but accusations of anti-Semitism and character assassination have turned the drama over Berlin's opera houses into a bitter battle of political ideologies, cultural visions and musical egos. <p>The outcome will determine the future of opera in the German capital and, according to some critics, shape the cultural climate in the city for a generation. </p> <p>At the centre of the row is Daniel Barenboim, the Israeli pianist and conductor who has been musical director of the Deutsche Staatsoper on Berlin's Unter den Linden since 1992. Barenboim last week accepted an apology from Klaus Landowsky, the leader of Berlin's Christian Democrats, who had referred to him as 'the Jew' Barenboim. </p> <p>Landowsky insisted he meant to compliment Barenboim when he compared him with Christian Thielemann, the 41-year-old musical wunderkind he described as 'the young Karajan'. </p> <p>'I have been working in Germany for many years with great joy and have been a resident of Berlin for almost a decade. I am very surprised to learn now, for the first time, that attention should be called to my Judaism in relation to my music-making or to my duties at the Staatsoper. I find this offensive and disturbing, be it mentioned in a positive or a negative context,' Barenboim said. </p> <p>Thielemann, who is musical director of the Deutsche Oper in the West of the city, has denied saying that, if Barenboim left Berlin, it would be 'the end of the Jewish mess' in the capital. A shooting star who made an acclaimed debut at Bayreuth this year with Die Meistersinger, Thielemann makes no secret of his delight in being compared with Herbert von Karajan, who joined the Nazi party in 1933. </p> <p>The young conductor insists his preference for German composers does not mean he is a nationalist. But left-wingers have long regarded him as suspect, and Barenboim revealed last week that Thielemann approached him three years ago to deny rumours he had made anti-Semitic remarks. </p> <p>'I accepted that and said to him: Christian, if it's not true, you don't have to defend yourself. If it is true, you have no business here.' </p> <p>Thielemann has suggested the latest rumours have been timed to prevent him from assuming a key position in a reform of Berlin's three opera houses. The Staatsoper and the Deutsche Oper would be merged with the loss of 353 jobs - including those of 77 musicians. </p> <p>Barenboim has described the proposal as 'cultural vandalism' which would destroy the identity of both orchestras and both opera houses. </p> <p>'It is a cynical proposal that may have been born out of despair. But it won't work, financially or culturally, to say nothing of the human dimension.' The Staatsoper orchestra, known as the Staatskapelle, is the second oldest in the world, with a history stretching back to the sixteenth century. </p> <p>While Barenboim has been fighting to retain the separate identity of the opera houses, Thielemann has hinted he would happily take charge of the merged opera. Thielemann is due to leave the Deutsche Oper next year when the composer Udo Zimmermann, with whom the young conductor says he cannot work, takes over as artistic director. </p> <p>Under the merger plan there is no role for Zimmermann, and Berlin's Culture Minister has indicated he would like Thielemann to play a leading role in the new structure. </p> <p>The opera house battle is taking place amid a heated debate over a call by the Christian Democrats' parliamentary leader, Friedrich Merz, for the country's Leitkultur, or 'defining culture', to be protected from the influence of immigration. Some critics regard the attention drawn to Barenboim's Jewish origin as part of a trend towards cultural nationalism that borders on racism. </p> <p>Barenboim wants the federal government to take responsibility for the Staatsoper. The government says this is out of the question. Thielemann has been playing down the rumours of anti-Semitism and insisted last week that Berlin remained a model of tolerance. 'In our orchestra we have 16 different nationalities. I work with singers, most of whom don't come from Germany, and with orchestras in Europe, the US and Israel. Berlin is the most liberal city of all,' he said. </p> <p>\u0095 Denis Staunton writes for the 'Irish Times'.</p>",
  "<p>Chemicals group Yule Catto is preparing to shed jobs after issuing its second profits warning in a year, blaming a surge in the price of oil-based products for a shortfall in earnings from its polymers business. </p> <p>The Essex-based firm, which employs 5,000 people in 40 locations, admitted its profits could be 25% below forecasts. Its shares dropped 24.5p to 138p.</p> <p>Yule Catto is taking a \u00a325m hit to cover restructuring which could involve the closure of several sites with up to 200 redundancies.</p> <p>Finance director Sean Cummins said the cost of oil-based ingredients for its latex and emulsion products had rocketed.</p> <p>Yule Catto's polymers are used in paint, paper coatings and construction materials.</p> <p>Mr Cummins said: \"It's extremely disappointing, of course, but we see it more as a blip than as a fundamental change in the profitability of the business.\"</p> <p>The effect has been aggravated by an explosion earlier this year at a supplier's factory in Pasadena, California, which has led to a delay in obtaining raw materials. The US authorities ordered months of safety checks after the accident, in which two people died.</p> <p>Mr Cummins said: \"We've been damn unlucky. It's not the sort of thing you'd expect to happen too often.\"</p> <p>The weakness of the euro against the pound will also hurt because 60% of the group's earnings are made in eurozone countries.</p> <p>Mr Cummins expects the group's restructuring to increase the focus on supplying ingredients for drugs to pharmaceuticals companies. This will reduce its dependence on cyclical prices for polymers.</p>"
