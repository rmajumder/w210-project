  "A senior member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has been suspended for making anti-semitic remarks in the wake of Al Gore's choice of Joseph Lieberman as his presidential running-mate. The remarks were condemned by the leadership of the NAACP as \"anti-American\" and the suspension was swift. <p>The head of the Dallas branch of the oldest and most influential black organisation in the country, Lee Alcorn, told a Dallas radio station, KHVN: \"If we get a Jew person then what I'm wondering is... what is this movement for? Does it have anything to do with the failed peace talks?\" </p> <p>Mr Alcorn continued: \"We need to be very suspicious of any kind of partnership between the Jews at that kind of level because we know that their interest primarily has to do with money and these kind of things.\" </p> <p>Kweisi Mfume, the national head of the NAACP, responded immediately by faxing Mr Alcorn a suspension order which will be in effect until an inquiry has been carried out. Mr Mfume said later that Mr Alcorn did not speak for either the NAACP board or any of its membership and his remarks had been both \"anti-semitic and anti-American\". </p> <p>As the row grew, Mr Alcorn claimed that his remarks had been taken out of context and that he was not anti-semitic but only anti-Lieberman. \"I don't see where he has been a champion for African-American concerns,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Alcorn's remarks were in contrast to those of the outspoken Rev Al Sharpton who told the political television show Hardball on Tuesday night that the appointment of Mr Lieberman was to be welcomed as a positive step. </p> <p>There has been a rash of anti-semitic messages posted on the internet in the wake of Mr Lieberman's appointment and America Online has taken action to close down a number of sites. </p> <p>As the news of the suspension emerged, Mr Gore and Mr Lieberman were heading for Atlanta, where they will pay a joint tribute to the work of Martin Luther King, a move which was seen as a sign to the African-American community. </p>"
