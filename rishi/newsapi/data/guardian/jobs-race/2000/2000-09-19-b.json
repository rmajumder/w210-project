  "David Clark, the former cabinet minister sacked by Tony Blair, announced yesterday that he is to stand as Commons Speaker with a pledge to abandon the wig and breeches traditionally worn by male holders of the office. <p>A popular figure among backbenchers on all sides of the house, Dr Clark is the most senior MP to throw his hat into the ring to succeed Betty Boothroyd, who will stand down next month. </p> <p>Dr Clark, who served as chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster for a year until he was sacked by the prime minister in 1998, won widespread admiration when he stood up to the lord chancellor during a cabinet row over freedom of information. </p> <p>His stand against Lord Irvine, who was seen as a bully during Labour's first months in office, has led MPs from both sides of the Commons to pledge their support for the MP for South Shields. </p> <p>Dr Clark, 60, pledged to be a modernising Speaker who would support an end to all-night sittings and a beefing up of the role of select committees. </p> <p>\"The days have gone, except for high days and holidays, when the Speaker should wear breeches, buckled shoes and a wig,\" he said yesterday. \"We have to show the country we are business-like which is difficult when the Speaker is dressed in a medieval fashion.\"</p>",
  "The Royal Shakespeare Company last night claimed to have broken the mould by casting a black actor in the role of an English monarch for the first time in its history. <p>David Oyelowo, whose family came originally from Nigeria, will play the title role in Henry VI Parts I, II and III, when the company continues its monumental two-year run through Shakespeare's Histories - entitled This England - during the autumn. </p> <p>His casting comes as the black British actor Adrian Lester prepares to play Hamlet, the most coveted classical role of all, for the director Peter Brook in Paris. Lester famously moved to America because of the dearth of roles for black actors in Britain. </p> <p>Michael Boyd, who will direct Henry VI for the RSC, insisted he had not set out to make theatre history. \"David really is a bit of a genius. It is colour-blind casting, his son will be white and there is no hint of illegitimacy.\" </p> <p>But Hugh Quarshie, who became the first black Hotspur on a British stage when he took over from Timothy Dalton in Henry IV nearly 20 years ago for the RSC, said al though he was thrilled for Oyelowo, it was hardly revolutionary. </p> <p>\"This is not a defining moment for black actors,\" he said. \"It is a lot easier to have non-traditional casting with Shakespeare. In fact, this seems only possible in the classics at all these days. The real problems for black actors come with modern plays and the cinema.\" </p> <p>Quarshie, who starred in the recent Star Wars prequel, said that only when black actors routinely play Hamlet and Henry V will casting have become truly colour blind. </p> <p>Oyelowo, 24, who joined the RSC last year, and is about to begin eight weeks of rehearsal, said he was delighted to land the role. </p> <p>\"Hopefully, it will pave the way for other actors. The more barriers come down, the better,\" he said. </p> <p>The production will open at the Swan Theatre in Stratford in November and will move to the Young Vic in London next April.</p>"
