  "<p>Huddersfield Town have chosen Lou Macari, installed as caretaker manager when Steve Bruce was fired last month, as the man to lead them away from the bottom of the table. </p> <p>Macari, 51, signed a two-year deal with the First Division club, as did Joe Jordan, a former Manchester United and Scotland team-mate who will work alongside John Deehan, Bruce's former coach.</p> <p>\"We are a three-man management team and Joe and John will not have official titles,\" said Macari, whose four-match spell as caretaker manager produced one point and no goals. \"We will share the workload. We are in a poor position but I do think we can make progress or I would not have taken the job.\"</p> <p>Barry Rubery, Huddersfield's chairman, commented: \"Lou obviously has a different style to Steve Bruce and as a consequence we didn't expect miracles overnight.</p> <p>\"But I think we have seen something of a minor miracle in the way the players have performed and responded, particularly in the last two games. What we need now is innovative football to get us out of the situation we're in.\"</p> <p>Jordan, a former Hearts manager who also managed Stoke in 1993-94, either side of Macari's two spells at the club, was last in charge at Bristol City during 1997, though he was later a coach with Lawrie McMenemy's Northern Ireland.</p> <p>David Kemp, a former Wimbledon and Portsmouth coach, has been appointed manager of Oxford United. He will be assisted by the former Millwall joint manager Alan McLeary, and Joe Kinnear, Kemp's No1 at Wimbledon, has agreed to be a full-time director of football until the end of the season.</p> <p>Milan's Taribo West, 26, was expected to watch Derby's game with Norwich last night with a view to signing for County, who earlier in the day completed a deal which brings the former Monaco right-back Lilian Martin from Marseille until June next year.</p> <p>The United States goalkeeper Brad Friedel is hoping to join Blackburn Rovers after re-applying for a work permit at a hearing which was also attended by the Rovers chief executive John Williams.</p> <p>The former Liverpool player, who had been denied a permit after failing to play sufficient games for the Anfield club, said: \"We are told we should know the outcome in a couple of days.\"</p>",
  "<p>Eric Cantona, who left Manchester United swearing he had finished with football for ever, has been offered the director of football's job at his hometown club, Olympique de Marseille, and appears ready to give up his life on the beach. </p> <p>Le Roi Eric, born in the Mediterranean city in 1966, had two spells at the club in 1988-89 and 1990-91, but now lives in Barcelona - his mother's birthplace - where his only connection with the sport is a passion for beach football. </p> <p>Marseille's biggest shareholder, Robert-Louis Dreyfus, revealed yesterday that he went to Barcelona on Monday to plead with Cantona to come home to save France's most popular club from relegation from the first division. </p> <p>However, as with much about Cantona, mystery surrounds the possible move. Contacts were reported to have been made between his representatives and the club president Yves Marchand, but this was denied last night by Marchand. </p> <p>\"There has been no contact. Not with Cantona, nor with anyone else,\" he said. Marchand said he recognised that Marseille had internal problems but \"nothing will be done at the moment\". </p> <p>Cantona, who won five league titles and two cup finals with Leeds and Manchester, may be the only man who can stave off a growing mood of revolution among Marseille fans after a series of poor results and internal rows. </p> <p>He has been offered total control of the club's recruitment and training policy, which may be just as well in view of his outspoken methods. His strong Marseille accent added abrasiveness to some famous clashes, including his dismissal of a former France manager, Henri Michel, as a \"bag of shit\". </p> <p>He first quit Marseille in 1989 after throwing his shirt at the coach, G\u00e9rard Gili, during a match, and despite his 45 caps he was persistently overlooked for the national team after France's failure to qualify for the 1994 World Cup. Apart from his four years at Auxerre at the start of his career, he barely stayed a year at any of his other French sides, including Martigues, Bordeaux, Montpellier and Nmes, because of personality clashes. </p> <p>This eccentric temperament led him to choose an acting career after leaving Marseille but despite an appearance as a French ambassador in the 1998 film Elizabeth he has failed to convince the critics. As a football star, however, he is still as popular in his home city as that other Marseille-born player Zinedine Zidane. </p> <p>Elsewhere in France, Paraguay's colourful goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert yesterday signed a 2-year deal with Strasbourg, currently 17th of 18 in the first division. </p> <p>\"Those who are successful are those who take on big challenges,\" he said after passing a medical. \"I'm completely dedicated to my work and hope I can do well here.\" </p> <p>Chilavert, 35, cost an estimated 15-20m francs (\u00a31.4-1.8m) from Argentina's Velez Sarsfield. He has been capped 51 times and has scored more than 50 goals in his career, mostly from free-kicks and penalties. </p> <p> o You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "The imminent end of the Clinton era carries serious foreign policy implications for Britain, particularly if the Republican candidate, George W Bush, is victorious next Tuesday. <p>Tony Blair and New Labour have maintained close links with Bill Clinton and the new Democrats. Some policy ideas, such as the working families tax credit, have been taken straight off Mr Clinton's shelf.</p> <p>The president's emphasis on centrist, inclusive politics has more than an echo in Mr Blair's third way. Mr Clinton's campaigning tactics, and his reliance on focus groups to track public opinion, have been aped by both Labour and the Tories.</p> <p>Mr Blair memorably stuck up for Mr Clinton during a visit to Washington at the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Mr Clinton has reciprocated in his tireless support for Mr Blair's efforts to achieve a lasting constitutional settlement in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>By way of contrast, Mr Blair and Mr Bush have never met. Indeed, the Texas governor has only ever made three trips outside the US, apart from visits to Mexico.</p> <p>Al Gore, the Democratic candidate, is a more familiar figure in Britain. But while offering more in the way of policy continuity, even a Gore administration would not be immune to unilateralist or neo-isolationist trends within America - especially if Congress remains under Republican majority control.</p> <p>Mr Bush's ardent support for the deployment of a national missile defence (NMD), designed to protect the US from \"rogue states\", is a prime area of concern for Britain.</p> <p>Although Mr Bush has suggested extending such a missile shield to protect Britain and Europe, NMD is essentially a policy that puts US interests first, risks a new arms race with Russia and China, and potentially undermines the Nato concept of collective security.</p> <p>When Condoleezza Rice, Mr Bush's foreign policy adviser, recently suggested that a Bush administration would pull US troops out of Kosovo and Bosnia, similar concerns were expressed.</p> <p>Such a unilateral pullout would call into question Nato unity of purpose, as well as risking the democratic gains in the Balkans that have been achieved since last year's Kosovo intervention.</p> <p>These considerations only compound existing strains caused by EU efforts to create a separate European defence identity, backed by a nascent European army reserve. Both Mr Gore and Mr Bush have doubts about this project which some in Washington see as a French plot to undermine US influence in Europe.</p> <p>Britain's policy of \"critical engagement\" with problematic regimes, pioneered by foreign secretary Robin Cook, is another source of possible future friction with both Mr Gore and Mr Bush.</p> <p>Britain's attempts to repair diplomatic bridges with Iran, Libya, Cuba and North Korea have often run ahead of US policy.</p> <p>The two countries take very different views of relations with Cuba, for example. The US maintains a strict embargo. Britain is in favour of normalisation and, only this week, sent a trade delegation to Havana led by a junior minister.</p> <p>While Britain is a keen supporter of the United Nations, and especially its international peacekeeping role, Mr Bush is deeply sceptical - while Mr Gore could scarcely be called enthusiastic.</p> <p>Mr Bush argues against unilateral or US military intervention in world troublespots unless justified by overriding US national security interests. He does not, for example, believe that a repeat of the 1994 Rwanda genocide would justify direct US action.</p> <p>Contrast this with Britain's policy in Sierra Leone, where a substantial military commitment has been made in support of the UN peacekeeping force and nation-building.</p> <p>The Clinton-Gore administration refused to get involved there. Both Mr Gore and Mr Bush reject the idea of placing US troops under UN command.</p> <p>The failure of US mediation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will not bring any change in approach from either Mr Gore or Mr Bush.</p> <p>Although many Arab countries believe the US is biased towards Israel, Washington is likely to resist any attempt by Britain or the EU to replace it as the leading peace intermediary.</p> <p>Other areas of potential friction include ongoing US trade disputes with the EU (which have brought sanctions against British exports), the creation of a rule-based trading system that is fair to developing countries, efforts to curb weapons proliferation, the UN's proposed international criminal court, and America's disinclination to fully support international environmental agreements like the Kyoto accord.</p> <p>On all these issues, both Mr Gore and Mr Bush are likely to espouse positions that do not concur with those of Britain.</p> <p>Perhaps most worryingly of all for Mr Blair, the change of leadership in Washington that could lead to a weakening of the \"special relationship\" with the US comes at a time when Britain is also at odds with its EU partners over fundamental questions such as the euro and greater European integration.</p> <p>Which, in a worst case scenario, leaves the United Kingdom all alone in the North Sea, caught between two stools and with declining influence all round.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto: simon.tisdall@theguardian.com\">simon.tisdall@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uselection\">US election</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour//\">Labour in power</a><br></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28simon+tisdall%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=simon+tisdall&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Simon Tisdall</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.open.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">British government</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.firstgov.gov/\" target=\"_new\">US government</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.un.org/\" target=\"_new\">United Nations</a><br> <a href=\" http://europa.eu.int/\" target=\"_new\">European Union</a></p>",
  "<p>The government is launching a campaign to combat age discrimination in the workplace.</p> <p>It is particularly concerned that small business owners are turning their backs on the over-50s.</p> <p>A 60-second national TV campaign created by D'Arcy is due to hit the screens next week using the line, \"Age prejudice - you're old enough to know better\".</p> <p>Although the campaign will target all employers, small business owners are seen as the worst offenders, cutting back employee numbers according to age and worrying about the over-50s fitting in.</p> <p>David Farrow, marketing director at D'Arcy, said: \"This campaign is necessary because age is not an issue in many companies' minds. </p> <p>\"They all have policies on race, sex and disability. Now age needs to become a topic of discussion, particularly in light of the skills shortage and the population getting older.\"</p> <p>The ad was written by Steve Meredith and directed by Ric Hawkes.</p>",
  "<p>Hamleys has clawed its way back into the black for the first half of the year through selling higher margins toys and chopping senior jobs and perks. </p> <p>But the company based around the famous Regent Street store is warning that trading conditions remain tough, with a fall in tourist numbers and no obvious big sellers for Christmas. </p> <p>The City marked up the shares 2.5p to 133.5p but one of the followers of the stock, Seymour Pierce, has cut its full year profit estimates from \u00a34.5m to \u00a34m. In the six months to September 23, profits before tax touched \u00a39,000 compared to a loss of \u00a32.6m - despite continuing refurbishment work at its Regent Street base. </p> <p>Group like for like sales were unchanged, with the recovery in profits coming from the increased sale of own brand goods and cheaper sourced goods. </p> <p>Simon Burke, who came from Virgin to take over as chief executive last year, plans to take out \u00a3500,000 of costs this year. Mr Burke has been acting chairman of Hamleys since the retirement of Howard Dyer - who left amid complaints of corporate excess. </p> <p>A new chairman is expected to be appointed and there will be a further assault on corporate waste, both at Regent Street and inside its Toystack outlets. </p> <p>Mr Burke was \"pretty pleased\" with the financial results in the first half because the market had been difficult - in part due to a 10% reduction in European tourists coming to London. </p> <p>But he expected to make further progress in the second half: \"Margins moved up strongly from 49.6% to \u00a353.4% and I will be disappointed if we do not improve this by a further two points in the second half.\"</p>",
  "Hillary Clinton and her opponent in the contest for a seat in the United States senate were engaged in a frantic scramble to get out the vote yesterday as yet another poll suggested that the race is in New York is becoming tighter. <p>Most polls during the past month have shown Mrs Clinton beating Rick Lazio, her Republican opponent, comfortably, but that has changed this week. Now both sides acknowledge that next Tuesday's vote will be decided by the team which is most effective in mobilising its supporters. </p> <p>\"It is critical,\" said Bill Dal Col, Mr Lazio's campaign manager. \"It is absolutely the whole race.\" </p> <p>The matter has been complicated by the absence of both Al Gore and George W Bush in New York: neither is campaigning here because they know it is all but certain that Mr Gore will carry the state in the presidential election on the same day. </p> <p>Only 44% of the electorate went to the polls in New York four years ago. If Democrats, who have 2m more votes in the state, assume that the presidential election is a foregone conclusion and stay away, Mrs Clinton's chances will be damaged. </p> <p>\"There is a real lack of urgency at the top of the ticket,\" said one of her advisers. \"Too many people see this as a risk-free election.\" Both candidates, whether talking to students or to commuters at railway stations, have been pressing supporters to remember to vote. </p> <p>President Bill Clinton, who has made several appearances backing his wife and will spend more time in New York than anywhere else before polling day, told a meeting at a church in Harlem: \"You've all got your minds made up: you're going to vote. So we are having this event for people who aren't here. Make sure anyone you can find is there next week.\" </p> <p>The latest of the oscillating polls shows Mrs Clinton leading 47-44, down from 50-43 the previous month. But those who are undecided went up to 9% from 6%. </p> <p>\"It still looks like Hillary v Hillary,\" said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, acknowledging that the vote is fundamentally a referendum on the Democratic candidate. </p> <p>\"Lazio's vote has barely changed. The movement was away from Mrs Clinton to undecided,\" Mr Carroll said. \"The good news for Lazio is that Clinton is losing ground. The bad news for Lazio is that he's barely gaining. The bad news for Clinton is that she's dropped below that magic 50% mark. The good news is that she's on the up side of a real squeaker.\" </p> <p>The previous day's polls pointed in opposite directions. One, conducted for the New York Times/CBS News, showed Mrs Clinton ahead by eight points; the other, by the Zogby polling organisation, gave Mr Lazio 47.8% and Mrs Clinton 42.9%. \"Basically, what you have here is a very close race, too close to call,\" said John Zogby. \"When all is said and done, it's probably a one-point race.\"</p>",
  "Raymond Gubbay, renowned for staging operas that please the crowds, has failed to amuse the Royal Opera House, which has rejected his application for the post of executive director. <p>Mr Gubbay, who has been a detractor of the ROH for most of the 30 years he has spent as an impresario, applied on behalf of his company, Raymond Gubbay Ltd, last month. Covent Garden invited applications after Michael Kaiser resigned in July.</p> <p>The application included plans to limit the number of seats given to \"friends\", which account for 80% of tickets before they reach the box office, and to reduce prices and increase the number of shows.</p> <p>Heather Newill, of headhunters AT Kearney, who were hired by the ROH to find an executive director, wrote to Mr Gubbay to tell him of the ROH's decision.</p> <p>She said they decided it was \"inappropriate for a company to run the Opera House,\" adding: \"Should you wish to apply personally, they will consider your application in the light of the criteria they have drawn up for all applicants.\"</p> <p>But Mr Gubbay said yesterday that he will not be reapplying for the job.</p> <p>\"Knowing the organisation as I believe I do, the rejection was not unexpected. A disappointment? No. I'm hardly under-employed,\" he said, adding that the reason for the rejection was a \"cop-out\".</p> <p>\"They don't want to have to address the issues I raised,\" he said. \"At the very least they might have had the good grace to debate some of them.</p> <p>\"They should have called us in to explain exactly what we could do. I think I've succeeded in widening the debate. It's my understanding that much of what I said is being taken on board.</p> <p>\"The position of chairman as top dog looks like it might change and they're paying attention to seat pricing.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for AT Kearney said: \"We don't comment on confidential things like this. It's people's personal decision to put it in the public domain. That's up to them.\"</p> <p>An ROH spokesman said: \"A process is taking place now for shortlisting people and interviewing. The panel may well have made a decision within the next month.\"</p>"
