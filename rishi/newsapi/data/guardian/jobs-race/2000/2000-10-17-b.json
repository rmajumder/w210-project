  "The Liberal Democrats were yesterday handed the prized economic development brief in a restructured Welsh cabinet, as the Labour leader, Rhodri Morgan, brought three new faces into the heart of government in Wales. <p>Despite disquiet among Labour activists about the terms of the three-year coalition deal, the Liberal Democrat leader in the national assembly, Mike German, has been confirmed as deputy first minister and will assume Mr Morgan's previous responsibility for all aspects of economic development in Wales. </p> <p>The second cabinet post promised to the Liberal Democrats in the partnership agreement has gone to Jenny Randerson, who takes on the culture and sports portfolio. </p> <p>Mr Morgan, who lost one cabinet member in protest at the pact, yesterday axed two more - the local government secretary, Peter Law, and the pre-16 education secretary, Rosemary Butler - to help make way for the changes. </p> <p>His decision to appoint the former deputy presiding officer, Jane Davidson, as minister for education means the nine-strong cabinet will again include a majority of women. </p> <p>Mr Law yesterday said he viewed his dismissal as a necessary evil.</p>",
  "The Prince of Wales should have been told to marry a black woman, according to the vice-chairwoman of the commission that produced last week's controversial report on race in Britain. <p>Lady Gavron, of the Runnymede Trust, a race relations think tank, said: \"It would have been great if Prince Charles had been told to marry someone black. Imagine what message that would have sent out.\" </p> <p>She said that the royal family sent out the wrong message about Britain: \"They're a symbol of our unmeritocratic tendency and, of course, they're all white. It is part of a very unattractive hierarchy\"</p> <p>She added: \"Anything hereditary is completely anachronistic and illogical: you wouldn't have an hereditary cricket team.\" </p> <p>The Runnymede Trust says it has received hate mail and racist telephone calls since the report on the future of multi-ethnic Britain was published last week. The report was criticised for suggesting the term British should be dropped because it is overlain with \"racial overtones\". </p> <p>But Lady Gavron, wife of publisher and Labour Party backer Lord Gavron, insisted she was still proud to be British. </p> <p>\"Lots of people are proud to be British, but what we were trying to say is that there are some people who don't want other people to be British and that's racist\" she said.</p>",
  "David O'Connor (Letters, October 16) may well accuse the Americans of historical ignorance in calling themselves Anglo-Saxons, but he will also have to take the Italians to task. The Italian name for the English-speaking peoples is \"anglosassoni\". That is how they referred to the British and American allies who invaded Italy in 1943 and I, in publishing a quarterly magazine for a society with Italian interests, have been honoured in Italy on a number of occasions for my services in promoting Italy to \"il mondo anglosassone\". But then, what can you expect from the Italians? To them Britain is Inghilterra and the British are inglesi. <br> <b>Colin Pilkington</b> <br> Burscough, Lancs <a href=\"mailto:colin@filitalia.demon.co.uk\">colin@filitalia.demon.co.uk</a>"
