  "They are all making outstanding contributions to their professions and they represent a cross section of multicultural Britain. Yet none of the three women who made it onto the shortlist for the Labour nomination in Betty Boothroyd's seat will be going to Westminster. <p>After a short but intense battle last month, Labour selected Adrian Bailey, a local stalwart, to fight the byelection in West Bromwich West. </p> <p>Few have a harsh word to say about Mr Bailey, the deputy leader of the local Sandwel borough council. But the overwhelming selection of a male local worthy, ahead of three impressive women, provides Millbank with an uncomfortable illustration of the difficulties faced by women trying to win Labour nominations. </p> <p>All three women who made the shortlist of six, have impressive CVs which would place them above many MPs at Westminster. </p> <p>Valerie Vaz, the sister of the Europe minister Keith Vaz, is a highly articulate lawyer who had been tipped as the front-runner for the nomination. Susanna McCorry, 47, a Birmingham city councillor who is married with two children, has a strong record on housing in the city where she runs a housing trust. Sandra Samuels, 42, is a cardiac nursing sister from Wolverhampton with a 20-year NHS track record. </p> <p>The three candidates, who are all still hoping to win one of the few remaining Labour nominations, choose their language carefully when they recall their experiences in West Bromwich West. Labour officials drew up the shortlist, using the party's byelection procedure, after interviewing the candidates at Millbank. Local members then had the final say at a meeting last month. </p> <p>Ms Vaz, a veteran of the 1999 European parliamentary elections and the 1987 general election when she contested the hopeless seat of Twickenham, said she did not encounter blatant sexism. The local party had made up its mind that it wanted a local candidate who was a man. However, the twin disadvantages of being Asian and a woman appear to have counted against her. </p> <p>\"I knew it was going to be difficult because I was told that they could not run an Asian candidate in the byelection because of the threat from the National Front,\" Ms Vaz said. \"I would have been a high-profile Asian woman and that counted against me.\" </p> <p>Ms Vaz said her experience shows that the Labour party suffers from the sort of \"institutional racism\" identified in the Macpherson report. \"People are not racist to your face,\" she said. \"But there is an inherent culture in the Labour party where many do not see an Asian woman as MP potential. Thankfully, there are many people in the party who are supportive.\" </p> <p>Her rivals also felt that the party had already made its mind up to select someone in the same mould as male local members. Ms McCorry said: \"I am concerned about how local members decide on candidates generally. In West Bromwich West there were three women who were very competent and were up to the job. But it is difficult to say whether there was sexism. Certainly in my field in local government, there is not.\" </p> <p>Ms Samuels, who was delighted to reach the shortlist on her first outing, was not put off. She felt that the Millbank interviews had been fair, although she hopes that the party will step up its efforts to ensure there are more women MPs. </p> <p>\"The Labour party has far more male MPs and the old boys' network is something the party will have to address,\" she said. \"We have a lot of female MPs leaving the house and I hope that there will be far more coming through.\" </p> <p>The winner dismissed any suggestion that sexism had worked in his favour. </p> <p>Mr Bailey said: \"Given that the neighbouring MP is a woman - Sylvia Heal - I can say that is not the issue.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Labour peer Lord Hollick is expected today to receive a bid of at least \u00a3100m for the Express newspaper titles from the Hinduja Group. </p> <p>The imminent bid by the group, run by brothers Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja, will turn the tussle for control of the Labour-sympathising Daily Express, Sunday Express and Daily Star stable into at least a three-horse race. </p> <p>United News &amp; Media, which owns the newspapers, rejected an approach last week by two other rich brothers, the twins David and Frederick Barclay, as too low at \u00a375m. </p> <p>It is understood that informal talks have also been held between Lord Hollick and David Montgomery, former chief executive of the Mirror Group. </p> <p>Rumours about other potential bidders, including Mohamed Al Fayed, the owner of Harrods, were also circulating last night. </p> <p>Confirmation of the imminent bid by the Hinduja Group, which has a wide range of businesses from banking to oil and media, prompted one source to comment last night: \"There does appear to be a horse race emerging.\" </p> <p>Lord Hollick is understood to want more than \u00a3150m for the Express group. Its main title sells approximately 1m copies a day, a little more than the Sunday title. </p> <p>Speculation about the future of the Express group intensified after its parent, United News &amp; Media, was forced to back down from its television ambitions after regulatory intervention. As a result, the group sold its TV franchises to Granada, and while Lord Hollick has denied that the Express is up for sale, major shareholders in United believe the titles are on the market. </p> <p>Lord Hollick is said to have told the Barclay brothers that he wanted double the \u00a375m offered, but it is understood that he intends to hold out for an even higher price for the papers, which he has turned from Tory supporters to enthusiasts for New Labour. </p> <p>The latest bid for the Express comes from two brothers who rank eighth in the Sunday Times rich list, and who also have close connections to the government. </p> <p>The Hinduja brothers, who are based in London, said that their bid would aim to counter any claims of political bias by setting up a board of trustees that would guarantee the editorial independence of the newspapers. They are British citizens and have two other brothers, one Swiss and one Indian. </p> <p>They made their first pitch for the Express to United News &amp; Media's financial advisers, Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, on Friday afternoon. They are expected to table it formally as soon as today. </p> <p>They said last night that the offer would be made by Amas UK, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hinduja Group. </p> <p>\"The group believes that with the appropriate structuring, good management, a strong editorial team and injection of cash, Express Newspapers can once again become an excellent business investment as part of the group's media communications business,\" the Hinduja Group said. </p> <p>The group pledged to encourage a \"genuine campaigning spirit on issues that matter to the British people and that improve the quality of life for everyone\". </p> <p>They will make their bid just before they discover whether they are to be indicted on bribery charges, with one of their other brothers, in India.</p>",
  "Tony Blair was meant to be leading the Labour party into the next general election with a historic guarantee that equal numbers of men and women would grace his benches at Westminster. <p>Labour's ambitious commitment of 1990 has, however, been quietly shelved as the party braces itself for a fall in its record tally of 101 women MPs, the first decline in a quarter of a century. </p> <p>In the 32 Labour-held seats up for grabs at the next election, only two women have so far been selected. If the 1997 result were repeated there would be a net loss of four women Labour MPs. To compound the party's embarrassment, the Tories are on course to have more women newly elected to parliament than Labour. No women have been selected in the 22 Tory-held seats which have become vacant. However, women have been selected in marginal seats which the Tories stand a good chance of winning. Six women will be elected on a 3.5% swing to the Tories - a net gain of five - while 12 women will be elected on a swing of 6%. </p> <p>Labour's poor performance with women is matched by its failure to select ethnic minority candidates. The party, which prides itself on its work on race relations in government, will be fielding a mere three Asian candidates in the general election, one of whom stands a good chance of winning. </p> <p>The Tories again seem to have a better record on ethnic minority candidates. The Ugandan-born lawyer, Shailesh Vara, will win Northampton South on a swing of 0.65%. A further 12 Tory Asian candidates are standing in mostly hopeless seats. </p> <p>The figures make grim reading for both parties which admit that they must do a lot better. Labour officials at Millbank are, however, acutely embarrassed because the high hopes of 1997 appear to have been replaced by a realisation that the party appears to be slipping back to its old ways. </p> <p>Labour took an extraordinary leap in 1997 with the election of 101 women MPs, an increase of 64. There were hopes that the party was on course to meet its commitment to have equal numbers of men and women MPs within three general elections of the 1990 party conference. </p> <p>The blocking of all women shortlists a year before the last election dealt a devastating blow to these hopes and set back the campaign for equal representation by years. Labour has attempted to maintain some of the momentum by ruling that all shortlists must have equal numbers of men and women. </p> <p>The dismal selection figures prompted Tony Blair to announce at last month's Labour conference that he will consider legalising all-women shortlists after the next election. His announcement was applauded by aspiring women parliamentarians who complain that the party's structures discriminate against them. </p> <p>Susanna McCorry, a Birmingham city councillor who failed to win the West Bromwich West nomination after making the shortlist, said that the Labour party was still a \"man's world\". She said: \"We need more women role models, otherwise the process can be very isolating for women. Men, who have most votes at parliamentary selection meetings, need to see more competent women as councillors to persuade them to select women.\" </p> <p>Her criticism was echoed by the women's minister, Tessa Jowell, who admitted that the selections have put Labour in a \"disappointing position\". Ms Jowell added: \"The selection process at a constituency level is more likely to select men. But there is also a distaste among many women for the style and culture of politics.\" </p> <p>Ms Jowell said that action to change the culture of politics, coupled with the legalisation of all women shortlists, should reverse the losses at the election after next. \"The all-women shorlists led to great progress that we do not want to lose,\" she said. </p> <p>Few women say they have experienced overt sexism in the Labour party, although the battle for the Dagenham seat was an unpleasant experience for the women involved. However, black and Asian candidates are warning of racism which is hindering their chances of being selected. </p> <p>Senior party figures are said to have warned that it would be unwise to select an Asian or black candidate for the forthcoming West Bromwich West byelection because of the threat from the National Front. Valerie Vaz, an Asian candidate who made it to the shortlist in the constituency but failed to win the nomination, said she was told the party dared not field a candidate from an ethnic minority. </p> <p>Elaine Blake, a graduate in international relations who has been rejected in five seats, said that Labour is terrified of selecting black and Asian candidates in white seats. Ms Blake, 47, a black former councillor, said: \"Labour says that it wants black people but constituencies do not. They want their own colour. My colour is standing in the way and it is very depressing.\" </p> <p>Labour knows that it has a long way to go before its benches reflect the British people. But ministers say they are \"miles ahead\" of their opponents even though the Tories are on course to increase their quota of women MPs. \"It will take 100 years for the Tories to catch up if they carry on at their present rate,\" Ms Jowell said of her opponents who will still only have 20-26 women MPs after the election. </p> <p>Theresa May, the Tories' women's spokesperson, admitted: \"No women have been selected for safe Tory seats and that is glaring,\" she said. Ms May insisted the Tories would continue to reject all-women shortlists, preferring incremental changes to Tory selections. Local associations have been asked to ensure that they interview the same percentage of women who applied for their seat. </p> <p>Both main parties are frank about their shortcomings in selecting candidates. But the Tories believe they are making strides which has prompted Central Office to release regular updates on their candidates' list. By contrast, Millbank is so embarrassed that it will not release its list until all candidates are in place. </p> <p><b>Candidates who draw short straw</b><br></p> <p><b> New Tory women candidates (1997 results in brackets; asterisk indicates likely winner)</b><br></p> <p><b>1)</b> Milton Keynes North East, Marion Rix, (7th target seat - Lab maj 240.
