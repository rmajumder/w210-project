  "<p>Towards the end of his playing days Peter Taylor had a loan spell with Joe Royle's workmanlike Oldham side so it must have been that much sweeter for the Leicester manager to take three points from his old boss after what has been a difficult week at the coal-face. </p> <p>Wearing two hats cannot be easy for England's caretaker manager, particularly after seeing Leicester's defence of the Worthington Cup undermined by Crystal Palace in midweek. But after his team responded with this win, which took them up to third place, Taylor took the opportunity to play down the demands of his dual role. He did it as comfortably as his defence coped with City's redundant attack. </p> <p>\"It's been very easy; I have not thought about England at all,\" he said. \"But after what some of the papers had to say on Friday, I'm sure you can appreciate I would rather talk about Leicester City.\" Taylor is angry at reports suggesting that he had been discourteous to England's manager-elect Sven-Goran Eriksson, from whom, he added, he is expecting to hear in the near future. </p> <p>The match was a tedious spectacle, as Royle opted to match Leicester's five-man midfield with one of his own. It would have needed something special to beat a team who have conceded only one goal on their travels, but City were not equipped for inspiration. Instead Robbie Savage settled it with a left-foot shot from the edge of the area after his first effort was blocked. \"Robbie's a lot more skilful than I thought he was before I came here,\" Taylor said. </p> <p>Only then did Royle introduce his most creative players, Ian Bishop and Mark Kennedy, and they soon offered more scope for their team-mates. Though Dickov, who had a low shot well saved by Tim Flowers in the first half, had a couple of half-chances, it was Paulo Wanchope who came closest, but his effort was turned over by the substitute Simon Royce. </p> <p>Leicester would have added to their 10 league goals if Arnar Gunnlaugsson had taken a late opportunity as Royle's side pushed forward for an equaliser, but he was stopped in his tracks by a superb tackle from Steve Howey, who if Taylor's mind wanders may just earn an England recall this week. </p> <p>Flowers, who must be hopeful of a call-up too, was withdrawn at half-time with a \"stiff back\" that required manipulation during the game while Nicky Weaver barely distinguished himself at the other end, and was particularly lucky to get away with handling outside his area. </p> <p>\"Of all our defeats so far that was the least disappointing,\" opined Royle, who is actively looking for a striker. \"They didn't cause us problems in open play but I can see how they keep clean sheets. We've got to find that balance.\" </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "They may back different candidates or none at all, but the main US papers are as one in believing that the presidential race is simply too close to call. Certainly, the commentators are placing no bets. <p>Michael Tackett, political editor of the <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/\" target=\"_new\">Chicago Tribune</a>, admits he hasn't a clue about the likely outcome: \"For all the speeches delivered and miles logged, attacks levelled and promises made, the long, costly race for the White House remains in the final weekend as ill-defined as it is close. </p> <p>\"It's a big race about relatively small things. Not war or recession. Not a hostage crisis or long gasoline lines. Not a missile gap or civil rights. Instead, it has been a battle waged largely at the midfield of American politics with the seemingly dominant issues being the cost of seniors' prescriptions and the government's stewardship of Social Security.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">Los Angeles Times</a> says the presidential contest is now \"down to the wire\" - a phrase much used on the front pages - and offers a vivid account of Al Gore's breakneck progress from state to state: \"With the race closer than any in decades, turnout is crucial for both sides. And it's most important in the tossup states where Gore and Bush appeared just hours apart over the campaign's final weekend. </p> <p>\"In their struggle for the 270 electoral votes needed to win, the campaigns have targeted swing areas of swing states so precisely that Gore stopped Sunday in the same Detroit suburb of Dearborn that Bush visited on Saturday. And here, as at every other stop, Gore told people their state was the one that could push him over the top.\"</p> <p>Rather cruelly, the paper also offers some reflections on losing the presidential contest, by some who have done just that: \"George S. McGovern, who lost resoundingly to Richard Nixon in 1972, recalls the silence, the loneliness. 'Where did all those voters go? Where were those huge crowds on election day?' he asks. 'You have a huge sense that the country deserted you and left you alone.'\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/chronicle/\" target=\"_new\">San Francisco Chronicle</a> offers hard evidence of the closeness of the race, reporting the latest poll in the vital state of California. It shows Mr Gore ahead of Mr Bush by five points, 46 to 41, with four points for Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, two points for Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan and others, and seven points going to undecided voters. The poll, with a 3.3 percent margin of error, showed a two point slide for Mr Gore from a similar poll released last Thursday. </p> <p>The paper quotes poll director Mark DiCamillo: \"With each passing day over the past week and a half, Bush has gotten closer and closer in California. Where once California was seen as a safe Gore state...now it's more of a lean for Gore.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/\" target=\"_new\">Dallas Morning News</a> reports the staggering amounts of cash which has been poured into both campaigns: \" Add the sums raised by presidential campaigns, House and Senate candidates and the parties themselves, and the tab this year has already reached about $1.9bn - by far the most ever spent during a campaign and more than double that of 1992. Throw in the money spent by interest groups such as the National Rifle Association, pharmaceutical companies and Planned Parenthood, and the total swells to nearly $3bn, according to estimates.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.herald.com/\" target=\"_new\">Miami Herald</a> is understandably focused on the surprisingly close race in Florida, where Mr Bush is struggling to maintain his early lead, in spite of his brother Jeb being the popular state governor. \"Bush's trip to Florida in the final days of the closest presidential contest in four decades and Gore's midnight rally in South Beach tonight are a measure of how critical the state and its 25 electoral [college] votes have become to the victory of either candidate on Tuesday. Vice-president Gore has also included Florida in his final 30-hour, seven-state, non-stop frenzy of campaigning.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">New York Times</a> reports the other frantic last-gasp campaign on its doorstep, between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick Lazio for the US Senate. It has a colourful account of the first lady's Sunday dash round churches to encourage the overwhelmingly Democrat black vote: \"The same striking scene was replayed again and again throughout the day: the wife of the president of the United States sweeping into Baptist churches in some of the most impoverished neighbourhoods of New York, to a rustle of excitement and raised hands and a swell of organ music and gospel song.\" </p> <p>Amid the frenzied claims and counterclaims, there is still space for humour, albeit of a caustic kind. The <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/\" target=\"_new\"> Detroit Free Press</a> features a cartoon in which a television interviewer asks a man on the street which candidate he prefers. He answers: \"Drew Barrymore - she's easily the best of the new Charlie's Angels.\"</p> <p>The paper also conducted a straw poll of 20 people to find how much they knew about the electoral college; the 540-member body which will choose the new president. Only two of the respondents had a clue. A waitress and customer at the nearby Clique restaurant shook their heads in puzzlement. \"I have no idea,\" said the customer, whose first name was Vera. \"Did you try the Yellow Pages?\" </p>",
  "<p>I was a terrible student newspaper editor. My vision for our paper was to turn it into the Daily Telegraph of university publications, which was a really bad idea, because the Daily Telegraph is by most measures a very good newspaper and we were by most similar measures really terrible journalists. Anyway, students generally want to read stories about the mice in their halls of residence rather than travel features about Czechoslovakia. (We did both, and I know which one now makes me cringe when I look at it.) </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Birmingham University's student magazine was never shortlisted under my stewardship in the Guardian's annual student media awards. Despite these shortcomings, it launched the career of a BBC children's TV presenter, nurtured the talents of a prominent newsreader's son, and (fortunately or not, depending on your point of view) confirmed my desire to be a reporter. </p> <p>Whether the newspaper, magazine or website is produced from an attic in the students' union or a purpose-built campus office, almost every higher educational establishment has some sort of student media scene. With advances in technology, producing a student publication has become easier and cheaper than ever. And as the media in general expands more university and college students are turning to their publications for that essential work experience before hitting the real world. </p> <p>Guy Adams, 22, who won the overall prize at this year's awards and was student journalist of the year for the second year running, says his experience at Sheffield University's Steel Press was invaluable. \"You have to get involved in student journalism, because it's the one time in your life when you're given free rein, and don't get bollocked if it all goes wrong.\" </p> <p>Adams, who has now graduated, is freelancing for the Daily Telegraph's Peterborough diary and has won six weeks at the Guardian as part of his prize. He says his experience as an editor gave him, early on, the perspective of someone who commissions and edits stories as well as originates them. He adds: \"As a reporter on a student paper you have to find stories yourself, so you sometimes have to be quite inventive.\" </p> <p>At a recent Top of the Pops event in Sheffield, a pushy young man with a mini-disc recorder was at the front of the pack to interview Craig David and Melanie C backstage, looking for all the world as if he were from Radio 1 or the local commercial network. In fact, he turned out to be from Swansea University's radio station. It was a stark indication that standards are rising fast. </p> <p>This year, there were more entries than ever for the Guardian's student media awards, with hundreds of applications from all over the country. The judges, who included the Guardian's editor Alan Rusbridger and broadcasters Jon Snow and Mark Thomas, said they were particularly struck by the quality of entries. Adams agrees: \"It's improving every year.\" </p> <p>Working in student media is almost always immense fun - although it rarely contributes to exam success - but can often seem a lonely business. There is no training, no guidance and no peer review - you just sit in front of a computer and get on with it. That's why the Guardian runs a conference on the day of the awards ceremony, where student journalists can meet established professionals, and each other. </p> <p>This year, students heard the Newsnight presenter Jeremy Vine deliver a strong advertisement for the profession; questioned the Guardian's website staff over the advances and opportunities in new media, and were told how columnists and editors view their changing profession. </p> <p>One thing emerged clearly - there is no longer a straightforward entry route into journalism. Will Woodward, the Guardian's education editor, outlined his traditional journey from student newspaper to the Guardian via journalism college, local and regional newspapers and the Mirror. Mediatheguardian.com's Amy Vickers took a circuitous route through the trade press and does not have a formal journalistic qualification to her name (\"doing a course just lands you in \u00a34,000 debt when you can learn all you need on the job\"), while columnist Gary Younge started on the paper as a translator. </p> <p>Vickers advises aspiring journalists to be clear about what they want to do. There is no reason to make tea for nothing in a local newsroom for six months and hope someone throws you a press release, when there are scores of trade magazines and websites which are clamouring for dedicated, specialised - and not necessarily experienced - staff to write copy for cash, she says. Others, however, counsel a more traditional route. </p> <p>But whatever way you go, the words of Will Woodward at last week's conference are worth bearing in mind when you're at your lowest ebb: \"It's the best job in the world.\"</p>",
  "<p>What a precious document is your CV - the deeply personal record of your status and achievement, your whole life contained in a couple of absolutely priceless pages. </p> <p>And on the open market, it is worth about five pence. </p> <p>It is an uncomfortable shock for job-hunters to find that there is a market in CVs. But their personal details, particularly when posted on the internet, can be hijacked and sold as a commodity, because, as any marketeer will confirm, there is value in names and addresses. </p> <p>It is a market discovered by Paul Smith, chief executive of FirstPersonGlobal.com, when planning his new online service. \"There are 3,000 job boards in action on the net, and I researched how they make money - which is by charging to advertise jobs, and charging to allow other agencies access. </p> <p>\"To make a commercial business or attract investment, you need both a candidate database and a client database. Down at the lower end of the market, where companies are desperate for capital, their benchmark is how many CVs they have, and how many people will pay to see them. If you look at the 'investor relations' section of some sites, you can see that they make their money this way.\" </p> <p>There is a huge number of CVs online - the biggest job-bank on the internet reports holding 700,000 - and the amount of private and personal data in cyberspace is immense. </p> <p>\"Some online agencies allow other agencies to search their candidate databases, for a fee,\" says Smith. \"If they openly say this, I suppose it's ethical. But candidates don't read an agency's conditions, so they are effectively giving permission for their CV to be distributed. I wonder if people know how much their data is open to the world.\" </p> <p>For the candidate, though, what is the problem in being exposed to more employers? \"There is no control over where your data goes,\" insists Smith. \"The very least damage that can be done is that your boss or human resources department recognises you and sees that you're look ing, so when a promotion comes up, you're listed as disloyal.\" </p> <p>It really is true, say all the agencies, that CVs unexpectedly get back to current employers. Even without a name, it is astonishing how many people can be recognised from a CV. Smith says that 80% of his clients think they could be recognised. </p> <p>\"Apart from a lot of personal data that you don't want spread around, I don't like the thought that there are millions of disappointed candidates putting their CVs up on websites and never getting a job - and yet their data becomes a number on the internet, touted around to make money.\" </p> <p>In a healthy job market in which well-qualified PAs are in demand, why should data be on sale? Why should agencies sell what would seem to be their most prized product? </p> <p>\"Is a PA database valuable? You bet,\" says Rosalind Renshaw, who publishes recruiters' newsletter Interviewer. \"It's part of the so-called war for talent. Good candidates have become a saleable, marketable commodity. It might seem crazy for an agency to sell its core asset, but it has certainly been known for a business in trouble to try to raise money by selling its database.\" </p> <p>Whatever the reason, Smith has been offered candidate databases at five pence a head, and Ian Wolter at Eden Brown reports having been offered databases two or three times, but having turned down the offers as \"shady\". Paul Barrett at Tempz.com points out that the value of a top PA's CV is readily understandable when related to the commission a headhunter would be paid to find her. </p> <p>Among other agencies, the most typical experience is that of Tate Appointments, which reports online agencies offering access to their databases in return for a search fee, or that of Secretaries Plus, which pays to access a well-known and reputable database, and transfers data on individual cases with a co-operative group of agencies - but only after asking candidates if they wish to be put forward for a specific job held by another agency. </p> <p>The unauthorised removal of employment data from websites is called \"scraping\", says Don McIntosh, chairman of the new association of online recruiters, the first group to bring agreed standards to web recruitment. And, he warns, scraping is not done only by small agencies - large names have also been guilty of it. </p> <p>Whatever the reasons for a trade in data, how can the jobhunter guard against the transfer of their personal details? </p> <p>\"Giving your life story to a complete stranger so that they can find you a job is something that demands trust, and looking for a job is enough of an emotional experience without worrying about this,\" says Tricia Phillips, London regional manager at Adecco. </p> <p>\"The question is, where does it stop? Is it now OK to share CVs with an insurance company so they can go round and sell something to the candidate? So, if you're registering online, be crystal-clear what you're agreeing to.\" </p> <p>\"To randomly post your CV is to allow anyone to use it,\" warns Jane Littlefield at Joslin Rowe. \"If you don't want your personal details bandied around the world, don't put them online.\" </p> <p><strong>Who is looking after your CV?</strong></p> <p><strong> Some major players and their policies </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Eden Brown:</strong> </p> <p>\"We have separate databases, and it is impossible to take our candidate details from the net; we never send out candidate details to anyone without their agreement.\" </p> <p><strong> Secretaries Plus:</strong> </p> <p>\"We won't send a CV to anyone without asking the candidate - not even if they have said 'just send it to anybody you think is right'.\" </p> <p><strong> Joslin Rowe:</strong> </p> <p>\"Our database is linked to our website, but is not accessible through it. Nobody can access either our candidates or their personal details.\" </p> <p><strong> Tate:</strong> </p> <p>\"A verbal agreement is made that details will not be transmitted anywhere without a candidate's permission. Nobody outside Tate has access to our database, and no details of any of our candidates are posted on the web.\" </p> <p><strong> Adecco:</strong> </p> <p>\"There can't be any price for losing the trust of a candidate. We will only share with another Adecco branch, and then only with the candidate's agreement.\" </p> <p><strong> Monster.co.uk:</strong> </p> <p>\"We give you the option of putting your CV in our database.

  "<p>It is arguably the most important date in the literary calendar. Tomorrow night, the winner of this year's Booker Prize will be announced at a glittering televised ceremony at Guildhall in London. But while the distinguished guests settle down to a lavish dinner to await the announcement, Mary Brown will be working very hard in the background to make sure everything goes as smoothly as possible. </p> <p>\"The Book Trust, an independent charity that promotes books and reading, initially administrates the Booker Prize,\" explains Brown, administrator for Colman Getty PR. \"We take over once the shortlist is announced - although we are working towards the ceremony all through the year. It takes a tremendous amount of organisation.\" </p> <p>UK publishers can enter up to two novels for a specific year, and any author who has previously won or been shortlisted for the prize can also be entered. \"The Booker judges read all the books - there were 120 submitted this year,\" says Brown. </p> <p>When the shortlist was announced on October 5, it fell to Brown to ring the relevant publishing houses to tell them the good news. \"That was a manic morning because a lot of people were out of the office at a press conference and everyone was screeching down the phone with excitement.\" Which is hardly surprising - not only does the winner receive what is generally considered the ultimate accolade for a fiction writer and \u00a321,000 in prize money, the effect on sales is staggering. The fastest selling winner to date is Roddy Doyle in 1993 with Paddy Doyle Ha Ha Ha; the morning following the awards ceremony it sold 27,000 copies in hardback within half an hour of bookshops opening. </p> <p>\"The publishers will then send us an unbound proof of their shortlisted book which is taken to a specialist bookbinder, so that we can give each of the authors a beautiful, handmade and leather-bound edition of his or her book,\" adds Brown. \"These are very valuable and kept under lock and key in a glass display case through the dinner until the time comes to present them.\" </p> <p>Brown is kept busy with the invitations. \"We start to draw up the list months in advance. There are certain people who are always invited but the list does change a lot from year to year. Of course, Booker plc, who finance the award, also invite guests so we have to run our suggestions by each other. Once the list has been agreed, we send out initial invitations with a letter that should be replied to by mid-October. This means we will know well in advance if someone won't be able to come and gives us the opportunity to ask someone else. Then we send out the official invitations.\" </p> <p>Organising the seating plan is one of the most difficult tasks. \"You have to be very diplomatic. Some people are very sensitive about whom they might be sitting with and you have to make sure you won't offend anyone. We have a huge plan of the tables up on the wall, and just juggle around with it until we've got it right.\" </p> <p>The judges do not come to a final decision until a few hours before the ceremony. When the decision has been made, the Colman Getty office is told. \"We then quickly pull a press release together which includes a quote from the chairman although the decision is still strictly under wraps.\" Then everyone heads off to Guildhall, where fax and email facilities have been set up to send off the press release once the winner has been officially announced. </p> <p>\"Everything is done with military precision,\" says Brown, who admits that, in addition to a strong interest in literature - she has a degree in English and philosophy - she is extremely organised. \"I temped on and off at the Poetry Book Society, but this is my first permanent job and I get tremendous satisfaction from seeing the systems I've devised working effectively.\" </p> <p>The Booker Prize always sparks off lively debate - and not just within literary circles. On the award's web site, users can vote online for their preferred winner out of the official shortlist and the result is announced a few days after the ceremony. \"Last year, the winner of the People's Booker, as it is known, was Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn for The Blackwater Lightship, rather than the official winner, JM Coetzee,\" says Brown. </p> <p>As Kingsley Amis put it, shortly after he was announced as the winner in 1986, \"I used to say that the Booker Prize was a bit artificial, but I have changed my mind in the last fifteen minutes. Now I feel it is a wonderful indication of literary merit.\"</p>"
