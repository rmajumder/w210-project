  "Irish travellers are a separate ethnic group entitled to the same protection under the Race Relations Act as other ethnic minorities in Britain, a court ruled yesterday. <p>The decision was taken by a judge presiding over the case of eight travellers, who are claiming racial discrimination against five London pubs they say refused to serve them because of their ethnic origin. </p> <p>Lawyers for Punch Retail, owners of three of the pubs, argued that the travellerswere not covered by the Race Relations Act so could not bring the case. But Judge Goldstein rejected the claims at a pre liminary hearing at Central London county court yesterday, saying Irish travellers had a shared history stretching back to the mid 19th century and should be given protection as an \"ethnic group\". </p> <p>\"Modern Irish travellers are guided by the culture and traditions which have been handed down by generations. They do not go around reading history, they practise it.\" </p> <p>He said that to exclude Irish travellers from protection under the Race Relations Act would leave three glaring anomalies - the appeal court had decided Romany Gypsies were covered by the legislation and the two groups shared many characteristics; it would fly in the face of the broad provisions against discrimination provided by the European convention on human rights and the group already enjoyed protection in Ulster under the Northern Ireland Race Relations Order. </p> <p>Four of the travellers, Patrick O'Leary and Michael, Margaret and Kathleen Kiely, were in court to hear the verdict, and said in a statement: \"We hope this success will encourage other Irish travellers to use the law whenever they are discriminated against.\" </p> <p>The travellers claim they were refused service in April 1998. Punch Retail was given 42 days to lodge an appeal before a trial date is set.</p>",
