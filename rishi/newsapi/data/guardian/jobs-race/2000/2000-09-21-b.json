  "A bitter row has broken out among senior German politicians over two victims of neo-Nazi violence who were ordered out of the country after their ordeals. <p>One has already left. The other is awaiting deportation. In both cases, the results of the attacks are said to have been used by regional officials in eastern Germany as grounds for getting rid of them.</p> <p>Their cases have been taken up by the speaker of the federal parliament, Wolfgang Thierse, who has claimed they demonstrate covert official backing for the far right.</p> <p>One of the foreigners, an Egyptian, Salah el-Nemr, owned a pizzeria in the town of Elsterwerda, 100 miles south-east of Berlin. After it was burned down by skinheads in October 1998, he was told he had lost his right to stay in Germany because his resident's permit was dependent on his having a viable business.</p> <p>Mr el-Nemr, who lived in Germany for 10 years, left the country voluntarily to avoid getting a deportation stamp in his passport that would have prevented him from returning as a visitor. He told a correspondent for the newspaper Berliner Zeitung in Cairo that he hoped to be allowed back in to marry his German fiancee.</p> <p>An Algerian asylum seeker, who has so far been identified only as Khaleb B, lost his right to stay on the grounds that he was no longer mentally fit to manage his life by himself.</p> <p>However, he and his lawyer maintain that this is because of the trauma he underwent in February 1999 when he watched as a friend was lynched in the streets of Guben near the Polish border.</p> <p>He is currently awaiting deportation. The trial of his friend's alleged killers began last week.</p> <p>The political row has erupted against a background of mounting alarm in the federal government over the prevalence of far right and xenophobic sentiment in the formerly communist east. The Brandenburg region around Berlin where both men lived has become notorious for race hate attacks.</p> <p>On July 28, Mr Thierse wrote to the interior minister in the Brandenburg regional government, describing the treatment of the two men as \"devastating\".</p> <p>The speaker, a member of the governing Social Democratic party (SDP), said that decisions taken by the regional administration's aliens department \"give the impression that German government agencies not only accept the consequences of rightwing and racist activity, but even use them as an official pretext\".</p> <p>His accusation brought a heated reaction from the authorities in Brandenburg. Earlier this month, the regional interior minister, J\u00f6rg Sch\u00f6nbohm, a Christian Democrat, replied to Mr Thierse demanding an apology. The head of the Christian Democrat group in the Brandenburg regional assembly accused the speaker of \"abusing his position\".</p> <p>Mr Thierse has taken a keen interest in the issue of neo-Nazi violence and its social underpinnings. He is a frequent visitor to schools in the east.</p> <p>The Brandenburg authorities have claimed that Mr el-Nemr's engagement is a ploy aimed at securing his return. However, when Berliner Zeitung's correspondent traced him in Cairo, he produced an intimate love letter from his fiancee. He was also carrying photographs of the dog and flat he left behind and of his fiancee before and after their separation.</p> <p>One of his friends was quoted as saying: \"Salah changed in Germany. He is serious about his work and always punctual. But what use are these German values if these people are capable of destroying the life of a peaceable, hard-working man from one moment to the next?\"1818 </p>"
