  "The play chosen for this year's Ludlow festival was Pericles, Prince of Tyre, which may or may not be by Shakespeare. The role of Pericles, I noted from the publicity, was played by Stephen Beckett - PC Jarvis in The Bill. Some might doubt whether playing PC Jarvis was necessarily good training for playing the prince of Tyre, but that is not the point. The calculation would surely have been that visitors wandering round Ludlow who might otherwise have been deterred by the prospect of Pericles would warm to it if it gave them a chance of experiencing PC Jarvis in the flesh. <p>There may be a lesson here for the much mocked and unloved Commons, now pondering on its holidays whom it should choose to be Speaker now Betty Boothroyd has gone. At least half a dozen names have been tossed around already - enough to suggest that if even half of them press their claims to the end, Sir Edward Heath, who will be in the chair, is likely to have an uncomfortable time on election day. The qualities needed are not much disputed. The new speaker must be firm but fair. He or she must be ready in times of trial to stand up for the legislature against the executive, just as 17th century speakers defended parliament against the incursive king. But also, in these televised days, the job requires rather more of a showman than it did in the days of say, Selwyn Lloyd. The speaker must have the presence and style to engage the attention of viewers. That was Betty's strength. Short of leaping on a despatch box and executing a routine from her Tiller Girl days she could not have done more to make the place look lively and human. </p> <p> Some of the present field, however admirable otherwise, would come as a let-down here. Betty Boothroyd's Tory deputy, for instance, Sir Alan Haselhurst, has all sorts of virtues (not truckling to Thatcher, for one), but he doesn't score highly on presence. Unlike Betty, he's hardly the kind of character you might just as easily meet in a soap opera. And the rest of the field looks a trifle fustian too. The veteran Conservative Sir Patrick Cormack might score with the public as the living epitome of what people think parliamentarians used to be like, though he might strike some who have never heard Sir Peter Tapsell in action as just a bit on the pompous side. Margaret Beckett has plenty of presence, but she would be straight off the government frontbench and anyway is not interested. As for Tony Benn, who could just run if pushed hard enough, he might certainly make Westminster exciting and ministers' lives a misery, though those who witnessed him years ago chairing a party conference might wonder just how much business would get transacted under his auspices. </p> <p>But if parliament is really concerned with its fading image, the growing sense that it's dull and irrelevant, there might be some temptation to take a leaf out of Ludlow festival's book and cast someone already familiar on TV screens in a totally different role. In that context, one candidate is already streets ahead of the rest. Glenda Jackson, as Labour backbencher and junior minister, disappointed her many fans, me included, who hoped she would light up the place. Her candidacy for the London mayoralty brought back a bit of the spark, though nowhere near enough to make her a threat to Ken. But imagine her presiding over the Commons: what style she would bring to the job, and what authority. A woman who breathed with the regal power of the first Queen Elizabeth in a TV series people still talk about, as well as in the cinema: who has played both Lady Macbeth, the Cherie Blair of 11th century Scotland, and Hedda Gabler, whose imperious word is enough to make a man kill himself: the muttering truculence of a young Dennis Skinner, the smirking disruptions of Tories like Eric Forth or David Maclean, the long self-indulgent ramblings of... well, too many to mention: one blast from her basilisk eye would cow them into submission. She would surely swiftly intimidate William Hague out of his recent practice of asking what seems to the flinching viewer like 10 or 11 questions of Tony Blair: one of the effects, presumably, of having only one session of PM's questions a week where there used to be two. </p> <p>Some timid souls may object on the grounds, not unknown in her acting days, that Glenda is \"difficult\", or that she's still to be seen in videos of films by Ken Russell doing various things not entirely compatible with the dignity of the office. And yes, if she ran, she might very well fail. But none of that should deter her. As she no doubt remembers saying: \"We fail! But screw your courage to the sticking place, And we'll not fail.\" </p> <p>Or perhaps they should call up PC Jarvis. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:david.mckie@theguardian.com\">david.mckie@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Joe Lieberman of Connecticut could be the key that unlocks the 2000 US presidential election for the Democrats. <p>If that turns out to be true, then it will be one of the more improbable transformations in modern American politics. Less than two weeks ago, Mr Lieberman was a relatively obscure, generally conservative Democrat senator, known to the public mainly because if his prominent criticism of president Bill Clinton during the impeachment crisis, and known to the Washington press corps mainly as an honest and interesting, but marginal, figure within his own party. </p> <p> Last night, though, thousands of delegates in the Staples Centre greeted the little man from Connecticut as a conquering hero when he delivered a smart, upbeat and generally well-judged acceptance speech to the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles. </p> <p>It must have been by far the largest audience that Mr Lieberman has ever addressed, and although he still seems stunned by the transformation of the past fortnight, it was an obvious success. He entered to the music from Chariots of Fire, greeted the audience with an improbable clenched fist salute and started his speech with a Jewish mother-in-law joke. </p> <p>But in contrast to his campaign appearances last week, this time Mr Lieberman dwelled only lightly on religious themes or the significance of his selection to American Jews and immigrants. It was a speech which set out to do four things. First, it had to introduce the still largely unknown Mr Lieberman to the wider national audience in a rare prime-time television opportunity. Second, it had to help promote Al Gore's generally lack-lustre public image - a major theme of this third day of the Democratic convention. </p> <p>Beyond these core tasks, the speech had to fulfil two potentially contradictory aims. It had to win the support of the black American electorate, a crucial Democratic base, but one which cannot be counted on to support a Jewish candidate. Simultaneously, the speech had to reach out beyond the party, to independent and undecided voters who needed to be given some reasons for preferring Gore-Lieberman to the Republicans' Bush-Cheney ticket. </p> <p>The first two objectives were easily fulfilled, Americans have no excuse for not knowing the key elements in the Lieberman narrative these days - the modest background in Connecticut, the days in the civil rights movement campaigning to register black voters, the abiding importance of his mother Marcia, the marriage to Hadassah Freilich, a daughter of Holocaust survivors, the assaults on Hollywood's debauched standards, then the attack on Mr Clinton over the Lewinsky affair. </p> <p>Last night the television audience heard nice stories from and about Joe Lieberman. And no one tuning in to the Democratic convention could doubt that he supports and promotes Mr Gore. After meeting the vice-president on one occasion, Mr Lieberman's young daughter said \"He must be a daddy\". </p> <p>Al Gore's virtues as a father were a constant theme of yesterday's sessions. Politically, though, there were other jobs to do. \"Let me just speak to those of you at home who haven't made up your mind if you want to build on our prosperity,\" Mr Lieberman said, before highlighting bi-partisanship and political reform as two key areas tailored to appeal to independents. </p> <p>\"I respectfully say to you that Al Gore and I are the guys who are ready to do the job,\" he said, At various points in his speech, Mr Lieberman praised Republican leaders like Ronald Reagan. He stressed his senate reputation as an \"across the aisle\" legislator, who had worked with Republicans in the past and who was happy to do so again. </p> <p>\"Our opponents are decent and likeable men,\" he said. \"I am pleased to call many in their party my friends.\" He praised \"my dear friend John McCain\" - the Arizona senator was diagnosed with skin cancer yesterday - and labelled him a great man. </p> <p>In the coming election, this appeal to the centre and to independents will surely be one of Mr Lieberman's responsibilities. The senator's quirky and unconventional voting record has raised some questions - especially among black leaders - about whether he will win over their support. </p> <p>In two warm-up speeches congressmen Robert Menendez, a Latino from New Jersey, and the formidable John Lewis of Georgia, who is black, fought to promote Mr Lieberman's anti-racist record. Meanwhile the man himself went out of his way to restate his support for affirmative action, as he had also done earlier at a meeting with the congressional black caucus. </p> <p>At the end, the Liebermans were bustled off the stage to prepare the way for Karenna Gore and Tommy Lee Jones to nominate Mr Gore for the election, and later for Mr Gore to make a surprise appearance himself, prior to being formally adopted. </p> <p>But the impact that the senator has made on the polls in just a few days has been good for the Democrats, and yesterday's speech is surely destined to push the party forward still further, as Mr Lieberman road tests his own considerable assets under campaign conditions.</p>",
  "Chopper, a gruesomely funny entrant for the Edinburgh film festival, was last night condemned for glamorising a self-confessed \"murdering bastard\" who claims to have \"wiped out\" 19 other criminals \"for the good of society\". <p>The low-budget black comedy, based on the nine books the hitman Mark Brandon \"the Chopper\" Read wrote while in prison in Australia, has taken the film world by surprise, knocking the Mel Gibson blockbuster The Patriot off the top of the box office down under this week despite being dropped by its distributors at the last minute. It is the first adults-only film to have performed so well there. </p> <p>Chopper Read earned his grisly nickname through the \"free pedicures\" he administered as a gangland enforcer, slicing off his rivals' toes with a bolt cutter. His notoriety grew while he was in Pentridge prison near Melbourne for attempting to kidnap a judge, where he cut off both his ears with a razor blade as a fashion statement, a trend copied by other hardcore convicts. </p> <p>But it was his infamous drunken appearance on the McFeast Live TV show when he groped host Lisbeth Gorr and joked about stuffing a victim in a cement mixer (\"It took us hours to get him into it, the bastard. He kept climbing out\"), that caused widespread revulsion. The series was later pulled and ABC had to issue a public apology. </p> <p>The film, which Rupert Murdoch's Fox corporation dropped last week, has caused most anger in Tasmania where Read, 45, served his last sentence for shooting a friend, and to where he has now \"retired\". </p> <p>The state's cabinet secretary and minister for women, Fran Bladel, yesterday repeated her claim that there was no value in making a film to further glorify a \"very sad and dysfunctional person\", who had profited from gross violent acts and achieved celebrity by joking about victims on TV. \"This film will certainly convey the message that to be cruel and vindictive and to beat women pushes you to hero status with a certain class of people,\" she said. </p> <p>Read himself, though happy with his portrayal by stand-up comedian Eric Bana, said he was angry that \"while every other bastard is making money out of me I've got nothing\". He insists he will donate the \u00a39,000 he got for the film rights to a police benevolent fund. </p> <p>The film has been a big hit with critics both in Australia and at Edinburgh, where it had a sneak preview yesterday. </p> <p>Chopper Read comes over in the film as a deluded but personable psychopath who thinks of himself as \"a normal bloke who likes a bit of torture,\" another Australian convict anti-hero in the Ned Kelly mode. But what makes the film both frightening and funny, and which had the audience in Edinburgh yesterday shouting its praises, was how it inhabits the mind of a clearly psychotic criminal like no other movie made before. </p> <p>The festival's director, Lizzie Francke, said she had no compunction about showing it and said getting its European premiere had been a coup. \"We had long and complicated negotiations to get it.\" </p> <p>Critic Dougal MacDonald, of the Canberra Times, praised the writer/director Andrew Dominik, who he said had walked a thin line making it clear that Read was \"a man devoid of moral worth\". </p> <p>Its British distributors, Metrodome, make no bones about selling it on its mixture of violence and black comedy, a kind of real life antipodean Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.</p>",
  "Professional footballer Ross Weatherstone was yesterday found guilty of a racist attack on an Asian taxi driver in which the victim was choked and his cab overturned. <p>The 19-year-old Oxford United defender was fined \u00a3500 with \u00a3200 costs by magistrates in Reading for using racially aggravating, threatening, abusive and insulting behaviour towards 22-year-old Zafran Naeem. </p> <p>The same penalty was imposed on two other defendants, Robin Antonowicz, 19, and Gareth Evans, 21, who were found guilty of racially aggravated disorderly conduct. Carl Walker, 25, was cleared. All denied the charge at a previous hearing. </p> <p>The men hailed Mr Naeem's taxi in the early hours of January 23 after a night drinking to celebrate Weatherstone's brother's birthday, the court heard. </p> <p>The 22-year-old cab driver told the court how one of the passengers grabbed his jumper and pulled \"so tight he choked.\"</p>"
