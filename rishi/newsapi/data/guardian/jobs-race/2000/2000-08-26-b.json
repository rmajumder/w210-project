  "I would like to clarify the impression that may have been given by the headline of my article (Straw's race policies are racist, August 25). <p>I do not believe, and did not say, that the home secretary's race policies are racist - they aim for many of the right targets and are much more positive than previous governments' policies. But they would benefit from more dialogue with ethnic minority communities and international bodies. </p> <p>On asylum, however, the government has failed to combat racist rhetoric effectively and some of its policies will lead to the social exclusion of minority groups. Unless these two policy areas are joined up, this risks undermining positive moves on race. <br><b>Anne Owers</b><br>Director, Justice</p>"
