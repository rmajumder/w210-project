  "<p>More than a third of us would like to work flexible hours, and more than a quarter would like to work from home, according to a new survey on work-life balance published by the Department for Education and Employment earlier this month. Research from the TUC last week comes to similar conclusions: five out of six of us enjoy the job we do, but as a nation we are working long hours and feeling the strain. </p> <p>The idea that a happy worker is a better worker may not exactly be novel, but it has been gaining currency of late. An increasing number of companies are endeavouring to measure and improve the satisfaction of their employees on an ongoing basis through that annual paper-filling exercise, the staff survey. </p> <p>It may seem an obvious question, but why do employers want to know how satisfied we are at work? For service-oriented organisations, one answer is that there is a direct link between employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction, according to John Hughes, principal of the Customer Service Network. He says: 'When I worked at Birmingham Midshires building society, we had Mori survey every member of staff anonymously, and independently we had a programme measuring customer satisfaction. When we looked at the two sets of scores, we found there was a direct correlation: branches with happy staff scored well with customers, and vice versa.' </p> <p>According to Mike Emmott, an adviser at the Institute of Personnel and Development, most large organisations routinely conduct a staff survey every year; small companies are far less likely to bother as they have a greater level of face to face contact. 'Managers may think they know what employees feel about their jobs, but in practice they don't ask these sorts of questions on a daily basis. So it's a way of deepening their understanding of employees.' </p> <p>There is no prescribed formula for what an employer should ask. 'Are you satisfied with your work?' is a pretty obvious question, but others range from 'Do you feel secure?' to 'Do you understand the company's objectives?' and even 'How do you rate the level of clean liness in the washroom?'. Employers may well have an agenda of their own, for example to find out whether particular initiatives are working, or whether specific messages are getting through. </p> <p>Karen Wisdom, associate director at Mori Employee Research, says one of her first steps when brought in by an employer is often to talk to employees and find out which issues should be included in the survey. </p> <p>Nevertheless, workers faced with a questionnaire for the first time are often apprehensive. Wisdom says: 'You encounter a lot of suspicion and cynicism from staff. Mainly it is a fear of their anonymity being lost, and a suspicion as to the company's motives.' She has seen questionnaires deliberately defaced - in one instance a banana skin was sent through the post. Wisdom says that to allay any suspicions, it is vital for management to communicate what the survey is about from the outset. She believes that using an independent company such as Mori also removes fears about anonymity not being respected. </p> <p>The most common failure with staff surveys, it is generally agreed, occurs when expectations are raised but the results are not acted upon. That may be because senior managers didn't buy in to the survey in the first place. If follow-up is minimal, it is much harder to get employees to take the survey seriously in subsequent years. </p> <p>'If no action is taken, a survey can actually be counterproductive,' says David Tong, senior project director at International Survey Research. He says employers must also be prepared to share the main results with employees, although they may want to put some of the figures in context. For example, around 60-70 per cent of employees will typically say that they are satisfied with their job; but the number saying they are satisfied with their pay is generally around 40 per cent. </p> <p>One reason for this may be tactical. If everybody says they are happy with their pay, it will not help when the annual pay rise is negotiated. But Mike Emmott says that evidence from national surveys, which are not com missioned by employers, is that long hours and the work-life balance are the biggest causes of dissatisfaction. </p> <p>The rate of response to an employee survey may depend on the method used. Once, questionnaires would have been handed out in the workplace, or distributed in pigeonholes, but some employers now post them to home addresses. As well as ensuring that they receive it, this gives them a more relaxed opportunity to fill it in. </p> <p>Electronic surveys are also gaining ground, mainly as a cost-saving mea sure. Usually this involves filling in a questionnaire on a website. But here employees may worry that their contribution is not anonymous: one way Mori has countered this is by allowing employees to take a randomly generated password before they enter the site. </p> <p>But staff surveys do not always have to be anonymous. TNT Express Services offers employees a choice over whether to put their name on the questionnaire. Those who do are promised a meeting with a manager to discuss their feedback, which is a huge commitment for the company, but is regarded as a way of ensuring the process is taken seriously. </p> <p>Chris Fowkes, TNT's director of quality, says: 'There are only a small minority who don't put down their names, and that may be because we have a very open culture here. Most of us have come up through the depots, and we don't have a blame culture.' </p> <p>Last year, TNT received a 75 per cent response to its staff survey, with a remarkable 76 per cent of employees saying they were 'completely contented'. Some cynics will continue to believe that staff surveys owe more to public relations than to a genuine desire to improve things but unions, once hostile to the idea, are among those who have been won over. Ultimately, any voice, even an imperfect one, is better than no voice at all. </p> <p>As Wisdom puts it: 'I still occasionally come across people who say: \"I've been working here for 10 years, and nobody has ever asked me what I think of it\".'</p>",
  "Two black women who were subjected to a barrage of racial abuse at an army base have been awarded thousands of pounds in compensation by a judge. <p>Sue Hunter and her sister Angie DeMeyer suffered chants of \"nigger\" and say they had guns pointed at them when they attended a dance at Oakington barracks, Cambridgeshire, in August 1995. </p> <p>The women say their ordeal came at the hands of soldiers of the first battalion of the Cheshire regiment, based at the barracks, whose commander-in-chief is the Prince of Wales. </p> <p>Nottingham county court ordered former soldier Kenneth Bragg to pay \u00a37,000 compensation to Mrs DeMeyer and \u00a35,000 to Mrs Hunter. He was dismissed from the army after a court martial in August 1997 for racially abusing the two women. </p> <p>But the county court on Thursday dismissed a claim for damages against the Ministry of Defence after the ministry argued it was not liable for the women's ordeal, even though this happened on its land. </p> <p>The MoD was condemned by Mrs Hunter, from Leicester. She said yesterday that several soldiers who had never been punished were involved: \"What annoys me is the MoD's attitude towards the case, they have still not apologised.\" </p> <p>She added: \"They are despicable, I still haven't had anything from the Cheshire regiment. We still don't know what happened to the other four soldiers who abused us.\" </p> <p>The two women went to the function as guests of the Cheshire regiment. Mrs DeMeyer's husband was a soldier with another regiment stationed on the base. </p> <p>The court martial was told that Bragg first abused the two women when Mrs Hunter spoke up for a black soldier being racially abused by him. </p> <p>With at least 100 people present, Bragg shouted at the two women: \"Couldn't give a fuck who you are, nigger.\" </p> <p>When the two women started to leave, one hour later, Bragg headed towards them and repeatedly chanted: \"Nigger, nigger, nigger.\" </p> <p>It was claimed at the court martial that up to nine other soldiers abused the women and they had two rifles pointed in their direction. </p> <p>The two women say that another soldier said: \"You niggers are only good swinging from trees and burning. If I had my way, I'd get a white hood.\" They allege they were also called \"filthy nigger bitches\" and, as they finally tried to leave, weapons were pointed at them and at a soldier trying to help them. </p> <p>Mrs Hunter's MP, Keith Vaz, said: \"I'm delighted that after five years they have managed to get compensation, but disappointed that the army has still not apologised to them. </p> <p>\"This was an event that took place on army property. The army should not run away from its responsibility.\" </p> <p>A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: \"We are pleased with the result. We have nothing to add because the MoD has not been found culpable.\" The spokesman rejected the accusation that more soldiers alleged to have been involved in the incident should have been punished. \"It is not a case of us sweeping it under the carpet, because if there was a case to answer, they would have been called to question.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Plans to build the country's first refuge for victims of racist violence and abuse have been given the go-ahead, raising hopes that the \u00a33m centre will open in Southall, west London, by the end of next year. The refuge will house up to 15 families for up to 12 months at a time and provide advice, support, training and counselling. </p> <p>Supporters include deputy assistant commissioner John Grieve, head of Scotland Yard's racial and violent crimes task force, and Michael Mansfield, QC, who represented the family of Stephen Lawrence during the Macpherson inquiry into the police investigation of the teenager's death.</p>",
  "<p>An embarrassing saga that prompted the departure of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's chief lawyer ended yesterday when the Wall Street bank settled its dispute with a former employee who claimed to have been a victim of racial and sexual discrimination. </p> <p>Christian Curry, the junior black analyst at the centre of a case that rocked the bank last year, dropped his claims for $1.35bn (\u00a3960m) in damages, more than two years after being sacked by the bank. </p> <p>In return, Morgan Stanley agreed to drop its action seeking restitution of \"illegal\" expense claims. The bank also agreed to donate $1m to the National Urban League, a charitable organisation devoted to advancing the interests of minorities. </p> <p>Donald Kempf, the bank's chief legal officer, described the settlement as a \"complete vindication\". Mr Kempf replaced Christine Edwards, who left the firm along with another lawyer last summer after it emerged that the legal department had paid an informant $10,000 for information about Mr Curry. </p> <p>The case led to an inquiry by the Manhattan district attorney's office into the bank's behaviour. It was subsequently cleared of acting illegally. </p> <p>In a statement Mr Curry, who has since found employment at a small Wall Street firm, said: \"This has been emotionally draining for my family, my fianc\u00e9e and me, and to continue would be detrimental to all. While I will receive no payment I am pleased with the result.\" </p> <p>Mr Curry had alleged discrimination on the basis of his colour and supposed sexual orientation after he appeared in a gay sex magazine. </p> <p>The bank instead pointed to receipts from toy shops and restaurants and expenses including lap dancing clubs. </p> <p>The young man's lawyer, Benedict Morelli, said yesterday: \"Certain situations call for people to rise above the fray and attempt to resolve disputes out of court. This is one of those situations.\" </p> <p>Mr Morelli added that pre-trial disclosures led him to change his mind. \"We now understand that Morgan Stanley Dean Witter engaged in no discrimination or misconduct against Mr Curry.\" </p> <p>After it was cleared by the district attourney's last year, Morgan Stanley admitted to having made \"a mistake in judgment\" by paying for information from an individual who could later have been used as a trial witness.</p>"
