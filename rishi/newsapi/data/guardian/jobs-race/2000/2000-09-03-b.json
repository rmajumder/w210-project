  "<p>In a madcap, mesmeric half-hour, England all but ensured that the elusive Wisden Trophy will be regained after 31 years. Inspired by one of their more diffident cricketers, Craig White, England ripped to shreds a West Indian upper order that is now as brittle as an autumnal leaf. The hapless tourists were dismissed for another paltry total, 125 - a deficit of 156 runs. By the close of another interrupted day, England, disappointed only by a pair for their captain, had advanced their lead by another 56 runs. There is surely no way back for West Indies from here. </p> <p>At 11.30 yesterday the tourists were content with their lot. Somehow they had nullified the threat of the new ball, so skilfully used by Darren Gough and Andrew Caddick. The ball had beaten the bat frequently; the odd lbw shout had been declined and the tourists, in the form of Sherwin Campbell and Adrian Griffith, were battling away diligently. By 12 o'clock they were 39 for five and the series was effectively over. </p> <p>As usual, the collapse began with the dismissal of Campbell. He had reached 20 in arguably his best, though by no means his highest, innings of the series. Caddick had been at his most testing, but the little Barbadian had left the ball with superb judgement, his footwork precise, his mind on the job. Maybe the introduction of Dominic Cork sent a signal to his mind that the worst was over, that the threat had receded. He relaxed and to Cork's third delivery he pushed lazily and the ball ricocheted from his inside edge on to the stumps. Cork looks a blander bowler than Caddick-his pace and bounce are less threatening - but he commands more respect than that. As do his figures in this series - eight wickets at ten apiece. </p> <p>Thereafter there was mayhem. In the next over, bowled by White, Griffith squeezed a full-length delivery to second slip, where Graeme Hick took a stinging catch. Out came Brian Lara. Unfair though it may be, all at the Oval concluded that the outcome of the game rested upon his contribution. He was the one West Indian who could turn this match around. He lasted one ball. </p> <p>White glided in and propelled the ball fast and full. Lara shuffled across his stumps - as left-handers do - and the ball eluded his pads before sending the leg-stump cartwheeling. This was Lara's fifth Test duck and his first golden one. The English players huddled spontaneously. They knew then that the match should be theirs. None of the other West Indian batsmen could hurt them. </p> <p>In the next over Wavell Hinds, half-forward, was lbw to a Cork inswinger. Hinds has had some dodgy decisions throughout this series and before departure he waved his bat to indicate that he'd just received another one. Batsmen are not the best witnesses in these cases; the ball may have hit his bat but only after thudding into his pad, in which case Umpire Shepherd's decision was correct. </p> <p>Ramnaresh Sarwan struck one sweet on-drive from White for four. He thought he was about to collect another boundary when driving square of the wicket only to see Marcus Trescothick dive to his right in the gully to pull off a stunning catch. Trescothick's presence in the side adds to a close-catching capability which already aspires to Antipodean standards. </p> <p>When Jimmy Adams nibbled at Cork to present a straightforward catch to Hick at second slip, his opposite number, Nasser Hussain, was confronted with a problem that he had not envisaged at the start of the day: whether to enforce the follow-on. At that stage West Indies, on 51 for six, were still 31 runs adrift of the follow-on target. </p> <p>In fact he did not have to make this decision as, briefly, West Indies rallied. Mahendra Nagamootoo, uncluttered by recent failures, took eleven runs from a Cork over, but soon allowed Trescothick to confirm his catching prowess in the gully. </p> <p>Enter Curtly Ambrose, who had dredged up his last reserves of energy in 31 impeccable overs in the English first innings. All in vain. Now he dragged his bat behind him lugubriously and with an exhausted air of resignation. So it was no surprise that he should swing at his first ball, miss it and be lbw. After this, there is surely no chance of Ambrose changing his mind about not touring Australia; and I doubt very much whether Courtney Walsh will be Down Under either. West Indies will travel to Australia this winter with the same barren expectations that accompanied touring sides to the Caribbean not so long ago. </p> <p>After lunch, there was a flurry of runs as Nixon McLean unveiled a couple of quality drives alongside an untroubled Ridley Jacobs. Their partnership of 45 was easily the highest of the innings. But White returned with sufficient menace to bowl McLean off the inside edge and then to remove Walsh's off-stump. White's five for 32 bettered career-best figures achieved in the last Test at Headingley. His transformation from 'bit' bowler to front-liner has been incredibly rapid and highly significant to England's future. Congratulations to him but also to Duncan Fletcher, who recognised his talents and then persuaded him how good he was. No doubt Illy, who first picked White back in 1994, will also give himself a little pat on the back. </p> <p>When England batted, Ambrose's pride demanded a final effort and he produced one. He was as unrelenting as ever and in his seventh over Trescothick edged him into the slips. Then Hussain collected a pair, the first in his career, when lbw to McLean before the clouds closed in. He will be grumpy about that but there should be major compensations around the corner.</p>",
  "It was news and no news; the most significant milestone in one of the most profound changes to affect the US in the past century, and yet a non-event. Last week the US Census Bureau issued figures showing that non-hispanic whites made up 49.8 per cent of the population of California. <p>Anglo-Saxon whites are already a minority in Hawaii and the District of Columbia. Now they are an ethnic minority in the country's most populous state, the one most usually identified with the American dream. </p> <p>'It's my hope we can all see our state's diversity as a cause for celebration and not consternation,' said California's lieutenant governor, Cruz Bustamente, a Latino. Robert Newby, a white shop-owner who has lived in Los Angeles for 40 years, echoed his optimism: 'This confirms what most of us have thought for years. I am happy for there to be more immigrants - by and large they work harder and have more money to spend.' </p> <p>As recently as 1970, eight out of 10 Californians were white. Fuelled by immigration at its highest rate since the start of the last century, and higher fertility rates, the Asian and Latino populations of California have risen by almost a third since 1990. At the same time, with limited immigration and low birth rates, the population of non-hispanic whites has fallen by 3 per cent. By 2040, hispanics are expected to be the overall majority in the state. </p> <p>Where California goes, the rest of America is predicted to follow. At present 72 per cent of the US population is non-hispanic whites; the US Census Bureau predicts they will become a minority between 2055 and 2060. </p> <p>Not every one likes the new face of America. White far-right extremists predict the break-up of the union. Thomas W. Chittum, a New Jersey-based Vietnam War veteran, declared in his book Civil War Two, that the US, like Yugoslavia, will shatter into new, ethnically-based nations. 'America was born in blood, America suckled on blood, America gorged on blood and grew into a giant, and America will drown in blood,' Chittum warned. </p> <p>The separatists have set up groups such as Americans for Self-Determination. One of the founders, Jeff Anderson, said: 'We are suggesting the US be partitioned into states for blacks, whites, hispanics, and so on, along with multi-racial states for those who wish to continue with this experiment. Now is the time to begin such a multi-racial dialogue about separatism, before a storm of violent racial conflict erupts.' </p> <p>The shifting sands of the US reflect wider - and highly controversial - changes elsewhere in the world. It is an area in which few demographers dare to tread for fear of being accused of racism. 'You cannot quote me - a word out of place and I get crapped on from a very great height,' said one academic. 'Whatever you say you are deemed racist'. </p> <p>The past millennium was more than anything the era of the whites. Just 500 years ago, few had ventured outside their European homeland. Then, with several acts of genocide clearing the way, they settled in North America, South America, Australia, New Zealand and, to a lesser extent, southern Africa. </p> <p>But now, around the world, whites are falling as a proportion of population. The United Nations collects and produces a vast array of statistics on population, but produces none relating to race or ethnic origin. Indeed few countries collect their own figures on ethnicity - in Europe, only the UK and the Netherlands do. </p> <p>However, the UN's State of the World Population 1999 predicted that 98 per cent of the growth in the world's population by 2025 will occur in lesser developed regions, principally Africa and Asia. The most significant reason for this is lower birth rates in rich countries: in 61 countries, mainly the rich ones, people are no longer having enough babies to replace themselves. </p> <p>In its World Population Profile 1998, the US Census Bureau predicted that by the second decade of this century all the net gain in world population will be in developing countries. 'The future of human population growth has been determined, and is being determined, in the world's poorer nations,' it said. </p> <p>The global centre of gravity is changing. In 1900 Europe had a quarter of the world's population, and three times that of Africa; by 2050 Europe is predicted to have just 7 per cent of the world population, and a third that of Africa. The ageing and declining populations of predominantly white nations have prompted forecasts of - and calls for - more immigration from the young and growing populations of developing nations to make up the shortfall. </p> <p>Last year net immigration to Britain reached 185,000, an all-time record. The Immigration Minister, Barbara Roche, recently announced plans to attract migrants to fill specific skills shortages, such as in the computer industry. </p> <p>Last month Edmund Stoiber, the premier of Bavaria in southern Germany, called on Germans to have more babies as an alternative to more immigrants. 'We are having too few children - to a worrying degree, the significance of which is scarcely recognised,' he said. His calls echoed those of a fellow Christian Democrat who earlier this year stood on a platform of 'Children not Indians'. </p> <p>In Britain the number of ethnic minority citizens has risen from a few tens of thousands in the 1950s, to more than 3 million - or around 6 per cent of the total population. While the number of whites is virtually static, higher fertility and net immigration means the number from ethnic minorities is growing by 2 to 3 per cent a year. </p> <p>One demographer, who didn't want to be named for fear of being called racist, said: 'It's a matter of pure arithmetic that, if nothing else happens, non-Euro peans will become a majority and whites a minority in the UK. That would probably be the first time an indigenous population has voluntarily become a minority in its historic homeland.' </p> <p>Lee Jasper, race relations adviser to the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, predicted a similar future, telling The Observer : 'Where America goes, Europe follows 30 years later. There is a potential for whites to become a minority in some European countries.' </p> <p>In Britain, that is almost certain to happen in London, and in the relatively near future. 'At the moment ethnic minorities are about 40 per cent in London. The demographics show that white people in London will become a minority by 2010,' said Jasper. 'We could have a majority black Britain by the turn of the century.' </p> <p>British National Party chairman Nick Griffin said: 'I don't think there's any doubt that within this century, white people will be a minority in every country in the world.' For Griffin, however, it is a major cause of alarm: 'Every people under the sun have a right to their place under the sun, and the right to survive. If people predicted that Indians would be a minority in India in 2100, everyone would be calling it genocide.' </p> <p>Yasmin Alibhai-Brown of the Foreign Policy Centre, who arrived in London from Uganda in 1972, said such fears are basically racist: 'Only white people worry about this. It's because for such a long time the world has been their own. To talk about it feeds a particular type of racism that says that blacks breed like rabbits. There is an underlying assumption that says white is right.' </p> <p>She added: 'There is a white panic every time one part of their world seems to be passing over to anyone else. But it's foolish to panic about it. So what if we do become a majority? What difference does it make?' </p> <p>For Alibhai-Brown, the decline of whites is a question of redressing the balance after they colonised much of the world. 'The empire strikes back really. There was this extraordinary assumption that white people could go and destroy peoples and it would have no consequence. It astounds me,' she said. </p> <p>But present trends have little chance of redressing the injustices of history. Native Americans used to have the lands to themselves but are now less than 1 per cent of the US population, with little chance of becoming a majority again. The biggest growth is among Latinos (largely derived from Spain), and Asians, particularly from China and the Phillippines. </p> <p>Jasper said the concerns of the British National Party are based on outdated ideas. 'The racial mix of nations changes all the time. There is no way that ethnicity of blood can be tied to a specific geographic place in a global world. You can no longer look at ethnic states, saying that Germany is Anglo-Saxon and so on.' </p> <p>Jasper felt the process would strengthen Britain. 'Diversity strengthens a country. It makes it more exciting. We have hundreds of languages spoken, when we go out to eat we never eat English, we eat Thai or French or Indian. It makes London a very cool place to live and work.' </p> <p>Nor does it seem likely that whites will become marginalised in terms of influences, even if their numbers decline. David Owen, of the Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations at Warwick Univer sity, said: 'Population has never been the main determinant of influence - it's wealth and income. White people still have their hands on most of the levers of military and economic power.' </p> <p>Even so, Griffin warns that, as in Germany and the US, the rise of ethnic minorities will lead to a backlash. 'It's going to put race to the top of the political agenda,' he said. </p> <p>But that seems unlikely. Britain has far less of a track record of racism and right-wing extremism than other European countries. Alibhai-Brown insisted that rising numbers of ethnic minorities could even help reduce what racism there is: 'The right-wing parties are growing in Somerset, not Brixton. The idea that more black people means more racism is not born out by the research. The more of us there are, it reduces racism.' </p> <p>Back in California, in a land built by immigrants, Bustamente put a positive spin on the end of the white majority: 'If there are no majorities, then there's no minorities.' In Europe, with its 40,000-year-old indigenous white population, the rise of a non-white majority may not be greeted with such equanimity. </p> <p> \u0095 In the United Kingdom, the number of people from ethnic minorities has risen from a few tens of thousands in 1950 to more than 3 million now. </p> <p>\u0095 In Italy, the birth rate is so low that, without immigration, the population is predicted to decline by 16 million by 2050. </p> <p>\u0095 The United States government predicts that non-hispanic whites will become a minority in the country by 2055. </p> <p>\u0095 The United Nations predicts that 98 per cent of world population growth until 2025 will be in developing nations. </p> <p>\u0095 The population of Europe is expected to drop from 25 per cent of the world total in 1900 to 7 per cent in the next 50 years.</p>",
  "Trevor Phillips, one of London's most senior politicians, yesterday accused police officers who had attacked the Notting Hill Carnival of stoking up a race row. <p>The chair of the Greater London Assembly said the debate on policing revellers had been twisted to reawaken old complaints that the Macpherson report on the death of teenager Stephen Lawrence had stopped officers confronting black criminals. </p> <p>'What some of the police and some of the critics are trying to do is reopen the Macpherson debate,' he said. 'They are trying to make it about race when Carnival is no longer even a black event. </p> <p>'They are trying to reopen the argument about the police having control of the streets. That was last year's battle, it was settled, it was closed and they should forget it.' </p> <p>London's Mayor Ken Livingstone, his race adviser Lee Jasper and Phillips have been working on proposals likely to be announced this week for a review of how the Notting Hill Carnival can be 'modernised' to maximise safety, after the two deaths at last week's event. </p> <p>'Our position is that what happened was obviously very serious and these things have to be properly investigated, but this is an event of one and a half million people, it attracts all sorts of people and all kinds of things happen,' said Phillips. </p> <p>'To use this as an opportunity to throw carnival itself into doubt is grotesque.' </p> <p>Livingstone is expected to echo his comments this week when he announces the review, involving carnival organisers, police, the London Arts Board and other interested bodies. </p> <p>It will look at expanding the carnival over a wider area of Notting Hill, and raising more money - including the possibility of a GLA grant - so that more carnival stewards can be deployed. </p> <p>'The opportunity is here to modernise this thing, which is something I have long wanted to do,' Phillips added. </p> <p>'My fundamental fear is not about crime at all, but what if there is an accident, if a sound stage falls down, if there's a panic? You could end up with another Heysel.'</p>",
  "It was a homecoming like no other. A state Falcon 900 jet touched down at Rome's Ciampino airport to be greeted by emotional crowds, flowers, champagne and beaming Ministers. <p>Welcome banners festooned the highway, songs were sung and everybody seemed to be wearing t-shirts printed with that familiar face. Silvia Baraldini, American revolutionary, jailed Black Panther, was back in the land of her birth. It had taken 10 years of lobbying US presidents to transfer her from a federal hellhole to a humane facility in Rome. </p> <p>Millions signed petitions, cities made her an honorary citizen, left-wing parties made her transfer a condition of entering government. </p> <p>Squalor, overcrowding and official vindictiveness were making her incarceration unbearable. She had cancer. It was a matter of principle and national pride that she be allowed to finish the last nine years of her sentence in Italy. </p> <p>That was a year ago. Baraldini, 52, has since been a guest at the pride of Italy's penal system, Rebibbia prison, outside Rome. But the voice that recently came on the line at Radio anch'io , a popular talk show, sounded different from the one suffused with joy at Ciampino. It was Baraldini, but she was halting, weary and depressed, with a confession to make. She had made a mistake. US jails were brutal, but Italy's were diabolical. Please, get me out of here. </p> <p>Mortification does not come close to what her campaigners feel. From their own martyr has come the most wounding insult: worse than America. Baraldini has been isolated, denied proper treatment for her cancer, denied regular phone calls to her ailing mother Dolores, 85, and denied regular visitors. 'In the US, I was able to teach languages, I gave a course on Aids prevention, I was able to discuss politics with other inmates. Here I have a more comfortable cell but I can only talk with inmates condemned for mafia crimes.' </p> <p>In Connecticut's Danbury prison she could make limitless phone calls and receive four visitors a day. In Rebibbia, it is six visitors and two phone calls a month, maximum. </p> <p>Her criticisms have stirred controversy over conditions in many of Italy's 217 prisons. Built to hold 40,000 inmates, they now house about 54,000. According to the Radical Party, in the past year there have been 83 suspicious deaths, including 59 suicides; 920 attempted suicides; and 100 deaths after hospitalisation. </p> <p>Justice Minister Piero Fassino has promised to investigate Baraldini's complaints. Reforms are to be implemented this month, he said. 'She will be able to choose her own doctor. Everything will change.' The centre-left government can only hope so because the embarrassment is excruciating. </p> <p>Baraldini's return was a diplomatic triumph expected to shore up crumbling support from left-wing voters traditionally hostile to the US. Her presence was to have been an asset in the run-up to next April's general election. The daughter of an Olivetti executive, her family moved from Rome to New York when she was 10. She became radicalised by Vietnam and civil rights protests and involved with the Family and the Black Panthers. </p> <p>In 1983 she was convicted of helping Panther leader Assata Shakur to escape from prison and of a planning kidnappings and armed robberies, including the 1981 Brink's robbery which left a guard and two policemen dead. Baraldini did not pull the trigger but was sentenced to 40 years. Another three years was added when she refused to co-operate with a grand jury probe into dozens of bombings. </p> <p>The harsh sentence and her refusal to turn informer made her a symbol of the international human rights movement. She was held in several prisons, including an experimental 'small group isolation unit' in Lexington, Massachusetts, which was closed after being found to violate constitutional rights. </p> <p>The European Parliament unanimously voted for her repatriation in 1995. Jubilant at the transfer, she told American supporters: 'You'll have to come to Italy - have a big vacation. The challenge for me today is to resettle myself in Italy, where everything is fresh and new.' </p> <p>Last year's euphoric scenes at Ciampino airport are being shown again on TV news. Pictures of Armando Cossutta, leader of the Party of Italian Communists, gushing: 'I hugged her with joy and intense emotion'; of the then Justice Minister Oliviero Diliberto stepping from a car with Baraldini's mother, claiming jail in Italy would be more humane than in the US. </p> <p>The triumph had not come cheap. A rapport between the then Prime Minister Massimo d'Alema and President Bill Clinton was crucial, as was Italy's support during the Kosovo war. The transfer was seen as an American sop to Italian outrage over the lenient US military court treatment of marine pilots whose jet sliced a ski gondola cable at an Alpine resort in 1998, killing 20. </p> <p>Baraldini alleges that Italian jails are for punishing, not rehabilitating; that they are cultural wastelands; that her fellow inmates are mentally numbed. 'Their interests are limited to watching television variety shows. I want to leave this trap,' she pleaded.</p>",
  "There is a higher guiding hand that moves behind the increasingly tense US presidential election, and it is not - as commonly said - Bill Clinton. It is the hand of God. <p>In a country that traditionally, and constitutionally, drives a wedge between the affairs of Church and State, never before have politics and religion been so closely entwined as in this campaign. Both candidates, and their running mates, insist that God is on their side; the Almighty is claimed by the Left, Right and Centre. </p> <p>George W. Bush found himself preaching to a humble, fundamentalist Christian Fellowship meeting in Kansas (where Adam and Eve, rather than Darwin, are taught in science classes) with a mixed message: Praise the Lord and lower taxes. </p> <p>But foremost in this sudden invocation of faith is Al Gore's nomination for Vice-President, Joe Lieberman, who last week broke all the banks separating faith and politics with defiant speeches on 'the need to reaffirm our faith, and renew the dedication of our nation and ourselves to God'. </p> <p>Even as Lieberman made his speech, massive 'pray-in' demonstrations of college students were taking place all across the South in defiance of a Supreme Court ruling that bans formal prayers at sporting events - tens of thousands of students gathering to recite the Lord's Prayer at high volume. Ironically, Jews in Mississippi refused to participate and protested. </p> <p>The result of Lieberman's speeches has been not to unite the faithful - in a country where 86 per cent believe in God. Quite the reverse: the Jewish community is riven by the stance taken by the first of their faith to feature on a presidential ticket, while Christians fragment. </p> <p>God had been a main stream issue in the election before Lieberman's selection. Anxious to court the Christian Right, Bush had spoken much about how his 'heart belonged to Jesus', and when asked who his favourite philosopher was answered simply: 'Jesus Christ.' After his many dalliances with new-age nonsense, Gore - who was born a Southern Baptist - declared to one audience that he was 'a child of the Kingdom and a person of strong faith'. </p> <p>And Gore's selection of Lieberman, an observant Jew, as running mate was widely welcomed as a wholesome breeze through a putrid polity, and an injection of morality into the shaming of the presidency by Bill and Monica. It was hoped he would demystify Orthodox Judaism in America, and bring the faith to its place in the mainstream it more than deserved. </p> <p>With Gore now surging from behind to lead Bush, running-mate Lieberman kicked off the week with one of the strongest drives to infuse American politics with religious faith. The first blast of the trumpet was from a Christian pulpit in Detroit, invoking the Ten Commandments and the 'inspiration of Jesus of Nazareth'. </p> <p>But the speech only highlighted deep reservations among Jews about both his candidacy and what he was doing with it. </p> <p>The Anti-Defamation League, with impeccable credentials in the struggle against anti-Semitism, had already lambasted Bush and Gore for scriptural politics, and now unleashed its strongest criticism so far against Lieberman, accusing him of 'hawking' his faith. 'We do not think that religion belongs in the political arena,' said ADL director Abraham Foxman. </p> <p>Lieberman, for his part, says he is claiming God for the Left - against the traditions of ideology in America. 'I respect the ADL,' he said, 'but I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing.' </p> <p>In California, he spoke again about the inseparability of faith and public life, and even said: 'Isn't Medicare coverage of prescription drugs really about the values of the Fifth Commandment, Honour Your Mother and Father?' Lieberman's aides are quick to draw distinctions between his comments and efforts by Christian conservatives to mingle religion and politics, noting that Lieberman supports abortion rights and opposes organised prayer in schools. </p> <p>The reaction of the enemy camp was simple. Bush headed straight for a fundamentalist fellowship in Kansas to declare that 'our nation is chosen by God'. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Lieberman interprets the Constitution in his own way, insisting the First Amendment guaranteed 'freedom OF religion, not freedom FROM religion'. </p> <p>The interpretation draws fire from the 'fundamentalist liberals' who hold to the origins of the revolution, the People for the American Way group. 'The government has to be neutral with regard to religion,' says director Ralph Neas, 'whether between one religion and another, or whether it's between the religious and the non-religious.' </p> <p>The American Civil Liberties Union invoked the ghost of John F. Kennedy, who pledged that, as a Catholic, he would take no order from the Vatican. 'If John F. Kennedy had said the sort of thing Lieberman is saying,' says the ACLU's Ira Glasser, 'he never would have been elected President. People would have been terrified.' </p> <p>Even the organised Christian community is not sure about Lieberman's stance. The Rev Barry Lynn, director of Americans for the Separation of Church and State, says: 'Lieberman's ability to understand the scriptures may be appropriate in Iran, but it ain't appropriate here.' </p> <p>But the backroom team in the Gore camp remains solidly behind the injection of religiosity into the campaign. 'Why should religion and morality belong to the Right?', asked one.</p>",
  "<p>The price of oil has trebled in just over a year. We are about to see a remarkable contest, a battle that over the next few years will decide the fate of the advanced nations. The promise of the 'new economy' is about to face the proven power of an oil shock. </p> <p>The new economy is a mere 10 years old - wiry, chipper, fast and virtually weightless. A nerd with glasses. Already famous, but not tested in combat, the challenger is about to enter the ring with an opponent who in post war history has never been defeated. Dark magic. An energetic giant that fuels the globe with 70 million barrels a day. Is black gold about to win another victory with an oil shock? </p> <p>Historically, sharp rises in the price of energy have been the best predictor of a slump to come. This happened in the mid Seventies, late Seventies and early Nineties. There are good reasons why. </p> <p>First, energy is a key input. When inputs become more expensive, costs rise, profits drop. Firms begin to go out of business. People are sacked. The price of oil matters both directly and because of its indirect importance in determining the prices of plastics, medicines, clothing, pesticides, paint, and thousands of other things we take for granted. </p> <p>Petroleum is also the lifeblood of transport and delivery. Its price shapes all energy prices. A graph of the price of natural gas and of coal looks like a smoother version of the graph for the price of petroleum, so oil prices govern electricity prices too. </p> <p>Second, if consumers from Seattle to Shanghai are spending more on their petrol and heating oil, they have less to spend on other things. A trebling of oil prices takes a bite out of disposable earnings. If people are poorer, they cut back on the rest of their spending. A theatre company or bookshop is not as immune from oil as its owners may think. </p> <p>The reverberations from oil price movements reach deep into the economy. The effects take time to work. Statistical research tells us that the lag from an oil price movement to an output or unemployment movement is about 18 months. Worryingly, the price of oil reached its minimum - $10 a barrel - around January 1999. </p> <p>Although I will be guided by the evidence to come, I do not subscribe to the new economy view. That is the idea that thanks to Bill Gates and modern technology a new epoch has begun: computers and such innovations have changed our lives, raised growth, and lowered the sustainable amount of unemployment. </p> <p>Yet we have seen such technological improvements before: the telegraph, telephones, television, faxes. When you hear young men and women saying this is a new era in the economy and the stock market, it is probably best to pull on your crash helmet. </p> <p>The surge in American profits in the late Nineties certainly helped produce plenty of cash for innovation and R&amp;D labs. That is assisting productivity growth now in the US. Something important is certainly going on in that nation. But fast American productivity growth has been centred on the information technology sector and is thus narrowly based. </p> <p>A year and a half ago the real price of crude oil reached its lowest level in post-war history. For a short time at the end of 1999 it was actually one half of the real price of oil in the Fifties, and one fifth of the real oil price that prevailed at the start of the Eighties. The logic of the ensuing boom in the western democracies is therefore not complicated. Profits have been terrific because energy became so cheap. This was a good time, therefore, to hire workers or to be a new entrepreneur. </p> <p>On this view, we do not need a 'New Paradigm' theory to understand the boom we have seen in the US and Europe. We have simply had what economists call a favourable supply shock: very cheap energy in the Nineties. </p> <p>Some argue that, because of the nature of changes in technology the black magic of oil does not matter as much these days. Nevertheless, as a group the industrial nations burn more oil than ever before. And because everything in the world is made using energy and people, when energy becomes dearer something has to give. </p> <p>It is true that we use energy more efficiently now. Compared with 1980, our economy gets 25 per cent more output for each unit of energy. That is useful; but it is a relatively small gain in the face of a trebling of the price of petroleum. </p> <p>Many of the analysts who think we can shrug off the fourth oil shock do not realise that the largest user of energy in Britain is now the transport sector. Transport energy use has shot up: today the sector consumes as much energy as the whole of industry and services combined. That is a fact worth carrying in one's head. </p> <p>Do not place too much hope in the notion that software is replacing steel mills and that this makes oil redundant. Look out of the office window. Look at the statistics.
