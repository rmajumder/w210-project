  "<p>Gary Johnson has spent much of this week apologizing, after he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/aleppo-gary-johnson-syria-war-question\">asked</a>: \u201cWhat is Aleppo?\u201d during a live television interview on Thursday.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/aleppo-gary-johnson-syria-war-question\">'What is Aleppo?': Gary Johnson bungles question about Syrian war</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But by Saturday, when the Libertarian party presidential candidate held his first campaign rally since the gaffe, he had come to see what he calls \u201cAleppo day\u201d as a positive.</p> <p>\u201cIt increased fundraising, increased attention,\u201d he told the Guardian as he prepared to address supporters at a hotel in Times Square, in New York City.</p> <p>\u201cPotentially, this may be a pivotal event in actually contributing to us winning the election.\u201d</p> <p>It remains to be seen how Aleppo day (Johnson\u2019s official explanation for not recognizing the name of the city at the heart of the Syrian civil war is that he was \u201cthinking about an acronym\u201d) will affect the former New Mexico governor\u2019s popularity with voters.</p> <p>Prior to Thursday, Johnson was averaging 9% in nationwide polls, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html\">according to Real Clear Politics</a>, which would be the best performance by a third-party candidate in 20 years.</p> <p>The problem is that 9%, aside from not being enough to win the election, is also not enough for Johnson to make the televised presidential debates alongside Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. And it is very important that he does.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way that we win if we\u2019re not in the presidential debates,\u201d Johnson said on Saturday. His supporters know that too.</p> <p>\u201cLet him debate, let him debate,\u201d was a recurring chant during his rally at the Marriott hotel.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/gary-johnson-what-is-aleppo-syrian-war-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/526zv\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2701593\"            data-video-name=\"Gary Johnson ignorant to center of Syrian war: 'What is Aleppo?' - video\"            data-video-provider=\"MSNBC's Morning Joe\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d174ece4b013613fffb4d9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/160809gary_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/160809gary.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/160809gary_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/gary-johnson-what-is-aleppo-syrian-war-video\">Gary Johnson: \u2018What is Aleppo?\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.debates.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=62&amp;cntnt01origid=27&amp;cntnt01detailtemplate=newspage&amp;cntnt01returnid=80\">To be included in the debates</a> \u2013 the first is on 26 September \u2013 candidates have to reach 15% in an average of mid-September polls by ABC-Washington Post, CBS-New York Times, CNN-Opinion Research Corporation, Fox News and NBC-Wall Street Journal.</p> <p>Even before Thursday\u2019s debacle, Johnson was lagging in those surveys. A 6 September poll by <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/06/_politics-zone-injection/trump-vs-clinton-presidential-polls-election-2016/\">CNN/ORC</a> had him at just 7%; in a <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/08/31/fox-news-poll-trump-narrows-clintons-lead.html\">Fox News poll</a> from 31 August he was at 9%.

In September last year, the Libertarian and Green parties <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/29/libertarian-and-green-parties-sue-commission-presi/\">filed a lawsuit</a> against the Commission on Presidential Debates, demanding that candidates who are on the ballot in enough states to have a chance of securing 270 electoral college votes, and are eligible to serve, be included. In August, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/05/media/debate-lawsuit-gary-johnson-jill-stein/\">it was dismissed</a> by a federal judge.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re contrary to the other candidates.

He would be able to offer himself as a more palatable alternative.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re so contrary to the other candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cAll they do is get up there and wanna kill each other. It\u2019s about presenting a rational thought on all the issues of the day.\u201d</p> <p>One of Johnson\u2019s well-known issues of the day is his attempt to legalize marijuana. He is the only presidential candidate who admits to being a regular cannabis user (he likes <a href=\"http://www.gq.com/story/gary-johnson-2016-presidential-interview\">edibles</a> best) although he has stopped using the drug during his campaign, and says he would not partake if elected president. </p> <p>Johnson\u2019s openness toward drug use has earned derision from some of the rightwing media, despite his extolling the virtues of fiscal conservatism on the trail. He would scrap the Affordable Care Act and he told the crowd on Saturday he wanted to see the sharing economy \u2013 the idea behind things like AirBnB and Uber \u2013 expanded to all types of business.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Uber everything. It\u2019s Uber electrician, it\u2019s Uber plumber, it\u2019s Uber doctor,\u201d he said, to cheers.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I\u2019d be the compromise\u2019</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe60cb0e23452bac7f0d2b1b74cd80daa5dcdc75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe60cb0e23452bac7f0d2b1b74cd80daa5dcdc75/0_238_4107_2464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson gestures as he speaks with the media.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryan R. Smith/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The last time a third-party candidate took part in presidential debates was 1992. Ross Perot, a billionaire businessman running as an independent and focused on balancing the federal budget, debated Bill Clinton and incumbent president George HW Bush.</p> <p>Perot was in a far stronger position than Johnson. In June 1992, he actually led the polls \u2013 he had 39% in one Gallup survey \u2013 and was able to use his vast fortune to buy up half-hour blocks of TV time. But even with these advantages, Perot ended up with 18.9% of the vote \u2013 a lot, but not enough to secure any electoral college votes, let alone the 270 needed to win.</p> <p>Johnson might not have to win 270 either. One of his planned routes is as unorthodox as his open discussion about <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2016/03/21/gary-johnson-reveals-the-last-time-he-used-marijuana/\">the best marijuana highs</a>. He believes he can become the next president by essentially spoiling Clinton and Trump\u2019s chances.</p> <p>He <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/gary-johnson-the-third-party-candidate\">told the New Yorker</a> in July that he was aiming to win a swathe of states in the west \u2013 including his home state, Utah and the Dakotas \u2013 and thus prevent Clinton or Trump from reaching the 270 electoral college votes needed to win. If no candidate reaches that total, the House of Representatives decides who will be the next president.</p> <p>\u201cDemocrats are not going to cross over the line to change to Trump, and Republicans are not going to go over the line to support Clinton. They\u2019re going to have to compromise, and I\u2019d be the compromise,\u201d Johnson said.</p> <p>Tom Tancredo, a five-term US congressman from Colorado, ran for governor as a third-party candidate in 2010. He won 36.4% of the vote for the Constitution party, beating the Republican candidate, Dan Maes, into third.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He will not become president.

Some voters are almost impossible to convince, Tancredo said. \u201cThey see the \u2018R\u2019 and they vote for the \u2018R\u2019 and that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d</p> <p>Rick Tyler, a Republican strategist and former Ted Cruz aide, said there was nonetheless a desire for an alternative.</p> <p>\u201cThe race is to see if Hillary Clinton can assemble more people who dislike Donald Trump than Donald Trump can assemble people who dislike Hillary Clinton. But that\u2019s not what people really want to vote for.\u201d</p> <p>If Johnson can make the debate stage, Tyler said, he will need to find a succinct way to articulate Libertarian values.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/08/gary-johnson-aleppo-comment-2016-election-foreign-affairs\">Gary Johnson's 'Aleppo' moment was cringeworthy, but he'll never be president | Jamie Weinstein</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe needs to combine his issues under a broad thematic that government can work in a limited way and to get people to believe there could be an explosion of economic activity that could create jobs.\u201d</p> <p>As for Johnson\u2019s backdoor path to victory \u2013 via a House of Representatives vote \u2013 at the moment it seems unlikely.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/politics/washington-post-surveymonkey-50-state-poll/2086/\">Washington Post-Survey Monkey</a> survey of all 50 states, Johnson\u2019s best performance was in his home state, New Mexico, with 25%.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/13/huxley-great-dynasties-aldous\">Thomas Huxley</a> knew a thing or two about the White Cliffs of Dover. \u201cWith vast needles and pinnacles standing out in the sea, sharp and solitary enough to serve as perches for the weary cormorant, [they] confer a wonderful beauty and grandeur,\u201d he wrote in an essay which he simply titled <em>On a Piece of Chalk</em>.</p> <p>For Huxley, a 19th-century pioneer of evolutionary biology, the white stuff was the perfect substance to demonstrate Earth\u2019s antiquity, made up, as it is, of microscopic, calcified creatures whose powdery remains give us the means to record events and express ourselves artistically. It even gave the country its name, Albion, from <em>albus</em> the Latin for white \u2013 a reference to the White Cliffs of Dover.</p> <p>So where better to sample a new national walking route than the chalk cliffs near Dover? The place that helped define the nation and the site of a recently opened section of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/26/england-coast-path-step-closer\">England Coastal Path</a> which, by 2020, will allow outdoor enthusiasts to walk round the 2,790 miles of the nation\u2019s shoreline. This journey will begin at the Scottish border near Bamburgh and take walkers down to Kent and the white cliffs, then along the south coast to Lyme Regis and to Land\u2019s End before heading up to Chepstow \u2013 for a brief break to enjoy the 870-mile Wales Coast Path \u2013 before rejoining its England Coastal Path at Queensferry and then heading to its northwestern extremity at Gretna. According to Nature England, this will be the longest continuous coastal walking route in the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad68256f143c20c3a2d709a0caa7db6892fe1580\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad68256f143c20c3a2d709a0caa7db6892fe1580/0_138_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sea kale on the pebbles at Sandwich Bay.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green shoots: sea kale on the pebbles at Sandwich Bay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wouter van Caspel/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of these sections will absorb existing paths that are being tarted up to the standards of a national trail while completely new sections are being constructed. My walk \u2013 from the National Trust\u2019s White Cliffs reception centre to Sandwich \u2013 would take in both refurbished path and new track and is part of the newly opened Kent section of the coastal path.</p> <p>And although only a few miles long, the section covers a startlingly diverse and strikingly beautiful chunk of countryside. The White Cliffs, in mid-summer, burst with colour and wildlife: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/16/alys-fowler-knapweeds\">greater knapweed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/24/plant-of-week-scabiosa-blue-jeans\">scabious</a>, lady\u2019s bedstraw, wild mignonette, sea kale, wild marjoram and thyme providing a multicoloured home for marbled white, chalkmill blue, skipper and meadow brown butterflies. Add the odd skylark wheeling overhead and you do indeed have a place of \u201cwonderful beauty and grandeur\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8e655bbbd0bd5a1e537c22b925495d45ce787b78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e655bbbd0bd5a1e537c22b925495d45ce787b78/0_113_4595_2756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Spectacular plant and insect life\u2019: a marbled white butterfly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Spectacular plant and insect life\u2019: a marbled white butterfly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet it soon becomes apparent as we begin our walk that these glories are based on only wafer-thin support. Patches of bare chalk protrude all along the coastal path here and reveal how painfully thin is the soil layer that supports its plants and wildlife.</p> <p>Nor are the cliffs immutable. Their chalk crumbles at a fairly substantial rate, eroding at an average of a centimetre a year. Every so often a giant chunk collapses into the sea. And for a coastal path this could be bad news. You cannot have the ravages of natures regularly wiping out chunks of your pathway.</p> <p>Fortunately, the new trail, which was launched in 2007 by the then environment secretary David Miliband, has been established so that Nature England will have the power to rebuild, further inland, any path lost to erosion. In addition, land between the coastal path and shore can now be used for recreation, for example, picnics \u2013 a right that was also established when setting up the Coastal Path\u2019s legislation.</p> <p>With its spectacular plant and insect life, together with the hustle of Dover, the world\u2019s busiest passenger port, behind you and the sight of the Calais coastline to your right, this first section was the most intriguing part of our six-mile walk. It is an exhilarating stroll which, after a couple of miles, takes you to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/20/churchill-wartime-tunnels-dover-national-trust\">Fan Bay Deep Shelter</a>, a gun battery cut out of the Kent chalk in 1941 that allowed Britain to shell enemy shipping in the Channel. Recently restored by the Natural Trust, its tunnels, scrawled with 40s graffiti, also provide access to a First World War sound mirror, a giant concrete dish which focused sound waves, rather than radio waves, as a not-very-successful method for detecting incoming planes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"183e518bcc70a2d6cdabf4ffa4b2f4ea8df6cc3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/183e518bcc70a2d6cdabf4ffa4b2f4ea8df6cc3d/0_134_5174_3106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Walmer Castle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ancient stones: Walmer Castle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Bailey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/south-foreland-lighthouse\">South Foreland Lighthouse</a>, you head down steeply to St Margaret\u2019s at Cliffe and head north to Deal and Henry VIII\u2019s Walmer Castle which later provided a home for Pitt the Younger and the Duke of Wellington (who died there). From Deal, the path then follows the coast to Sandwich along a beach made of steep shingle. The pace here is slow and heavy though the place is not without its fascinations, the coast being rich in populations of waders and wildfowl.</p> <p>Two thirds of the way to Pegwell Bay, the path used to turn east to Sandwich, but now has an extra three miles of route added to it to take walkers round the peninsula at Shellness and down the River Stour to Sandwich, creating a series of new ponds and reserves that are already being colonised by egrets and other wildfowl. It is a stunning little thoroughfare bursting with history and wildlife and as pleasant a few miles as I have ever walked.</p> <p>Chalk one up to the coastal path.</p>",

Critical response to director <a href=\"http://www.dundeerep.co.uk/event/cheviot-tour\">Joe Douglas\u2019s production</a> - first mounted in Dundee last year and now revived for a tour - is overwhelmingly enthusiastic. <em>The Cheviot</em> lives up to expectation. Now, I have three regrets. A small one: this tour is not more extensive. A huge one: the subject matter is as fresh today as it was then - the economic interests of the few still blight (I speak mildly) the lives of the many (new material neatly throws Donald Trump, for instance, into the original script). One for another moment: 7:84\u2019s challenge to practitioners to address the political structure of theatre as well as of society is so hard to meet.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://cheviottour.co.uk/tour-dates\">The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil tours until 22 October</a><br></p>"
