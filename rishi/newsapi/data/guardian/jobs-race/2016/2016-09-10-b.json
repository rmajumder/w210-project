  "<p>America has never been entirely sure what to do with its white poor. For complicated historical and political reasons, we associate \u201cpoor\u201d in our public consciousness with \u201cblack\u201d. Terms such as \u201cwelfare queen\u201d and \u201cculture of poverty\u201d became associated uniquely with the social maladies of African Americans in urban ghettos, despite the fact that poor whites outnumbered poor blacks.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t always thus. When <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/lbj-union64/\" title=\"\">President Lyndon Baines Johnson </a>launched his \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d in the 1960s, he did so from eastern Kentucky coal country, then and now one of the poorest regions of the country. That region is my ancestral homeland, the place from which my grandparents emigrated to avoid the sort of material destitution President Johnson highlighted. Like millions of southern and Appalachian migrants, they moved north to the booming industrial economies of Ohio, Pennsylvania and similar states.</p> <p>They moved in the hope of finding better jobs and higher wages and for a time they found those things. Yet in the wake of a long-term decline in manufacturing in the United States, the economic boomtown my grandparents migrated to began to struggle in many of the same ways as the eastern Kentucky town they left behind. By the time their grandchildren reached adulthood in the early 2000s, joblessness and despair had replaced the optimism that characterised my grandparents 50 years earlier. And though the local economies of each region differed \u2013 in Detroit, automobile manufacturing; in southern Ohio, steel and paper mills; in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, coal mining \u2013 the social problems looked eerily similar. All across Appalachia and the Rust Belt, opioid addiction, family breakdown and rising mortality set in. And the ills afflicting the white working class, so similar to those stereotypically assigned to the black poor, became impossible to ignore.</p> <p>To many commentators, these problems are statistics to be analysed, but to me, they were the backdrop of my youth. As a kid, I sorted Middletown into three basic geographic regions. First, the area surrounding the high school, which opened in 1969. The \u201crich\u201d kids lived here. Large homes mixed comfortably with well-kept parks and office complexes. If your dad was a doctor, he almost certainly owned a home or had an office here, if not both. I dreamed that I\u2019d own a house in Manchester Manor, a relatively new development not a mile from the high school, where a nice home went for less than a fifth of the price of a decent house in San Francisco. Next, the poor kids (the really poor kids) lived near Armco, where even the nice homes had been converted into multi-family apartment units. I didn\u2019t know until recently that this neighbourhood was actually two neighbourhoods \u2013 one inhabited by Middletown\u2019s working-class black population, the other by its poorest white population. Middletown\u2019s few housing projects stood there.</p> <p>Then there was the area where we lived \u2013 mostly single-family homes, with abandoned warehouses and factories within walking distance. Looking back, I don\u2019t know if the \u201creally poor\u201d areas and my block were any different or whether these divisions were the constructs of a mind that didn\u2019t want to believe we were really poor.</p> <p>Across the street from our house was Miami Park, a single city block with a swing set, a tennis court, a baseball field and a basketball court. As I grew up, I noticed that the tennis court lines faded with each passing month and that the city had stopped filling in the cracks or replacing the nets on the basketball courts. I was still young when the tennis court became little more than a cement block littered with grass patches. I learned that our neighbourhood had \u201cgone downhill\u201d after two bikes were stolen in the course of the week. For years, Mamaw said, her children had left their bikes unchained in the yard with no problems. Now we woke to find thick locks cracked in two by deadbolt cutters. From that point forward, I walked.</p> <h2><strong>Downtown Middletown is little more than a relic </strong></h2> <p>If Middletown had changed little by the time I was born, the writing was on the wall almost immediately thereafter. It\u2019s easy even for residents to miss how much Middletown has changed because the change has been gradual \u2013 more erosion than mudslide. But it\u2019s obvious if you know where to look and a common refrain for those of us who return intermittently is: \u201cGeez, Middletown is not looking good.\u201d</p> <p>In the 1980s, Middletown had a proud, almost idyllic downtown: a bustling shopping centre, restaurants that had operated since before the Second World War and a few bars where men like Papaw would gather and have a beer (or sometimes many) after a hard day at the steel mill. My favourite store was the local Kmart, which was the main attraction in a strip mall, near a branch of Dillman\u2019s, a local grocer with three or four locations. Now the strip mall is mostly bare: Kmart stands empty and the Dillman family closed that big store and all the rest, too. The last I checked, there was only an Arby\u2019s, a discount grocery store, and a Chinese buffet in what was once a Middletown centre of commerce. The scene at that strip mall is hardly uncommon. Few Middletown businesses are doing well and many have ceased operating altogether. Twenty years ago, there were two malls. Now one of those malls is a parking lot and the other serves as a walking course for the elderly.</p> <p>Today, downtown Middletown is little more than a relic of American industrial glory. Abandoned shops line the heart of downtown Middletown, where Central Avenue and Main Street meet. Richie\u2019s pawnshop has long since closed, though the hideous yellow and green sign still marks the site, last time I checked. Richie\u2019s isn\u2019t far from an old pharmacy that, in its heyday, had a soda bar and served root beer floats. Across the street is a building that looks like a theatre, with one of those giant triangular signs that reads \u201cST\u2013L\u201d because the letters in the middle were shattered and not replaced. A little farther down the road is a cash-for-gold store and not far from that is a payday lending outfit.</p> <p>Not far from the main drag of empty shops and boarded-up windows is the Sorg mansion. The Sorgs, a powerful and wealthy industrial family dating back to the 19th century, operated a large paper mill in Middletown. They donated enough money to put their names on the local opera house and helped build Middletown into a respectable enough city to attract Armco. Their mansion, a gigantic manor home, sits near a formerly proud Middletown country club. Despite its beauty, a Maryland couple recently purchased the mansion for $225,000 or about half of what a decent multi-room apartment sets you back in Washington DC.</p> <p>Located quite literally on Main Street, the Sorg mansion is just up the road from a number of opulent homes that housed Middletown\u2019s wealthy in their heyday. Most have fallen into disrepair. Those that haven\u2019t have been subdivided into small apartments for Middletown\u2019s poorest residents. A street that was once the pride of Middletown is now a notorious spot for druggies and dealers. Main Street is now the place you avoid after dark.</p> <h2><strong>The white working class had grown angry. And it had no heroes</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>City leaders have tried in vain to revive Middle-town\u2019s downtown, though in recent years they\u2019ve met with some limited success, as a few businesses have opened near the newest branch of a local community college. Despite some progress, efforts to reinvent downtown Middletown are likely futile. People didn\u2019t leave because our downtown lacked trendy cultural amenities. The trendy cultural amenities left because there weren\u2019t enough consumers in Middletown to support them. And why weren\u2019t there enough well-paying consumers? Because there weren\u2019t enough jobs to employ those consumers. Downtown Middletown\u2019s struggles were a symptom of everything else happening to Middletown\u2019s people, especially the collapsing importance of the local steel mill.</p> <p>Unfortunately, very few of America\u2019s political or financial classes understood what was happening in towns such as Middletown. And this ignorance comes in part from their increasing segregation from working- and middle-class families. In booming Washington DC, cosmopolitan New York and hi-tech San Francisco, people rarely come face to face with the poor, with the possible exception of the random beggar. Their interactions with the poor of rural and suburban America are rarer still. Meanwhile, as a 2011 Brookings Institute study found, \u201ccompared to 2000, residents of extreme-poverty neighbourhoods in 2005\u20132009 were more likely to be white, native-born, high-school or college graduates, homeowners and not receiving public assistance\u201d. The white poor always existed, but they were rapidly growing in numbers and America\u2019s wealthiest and most powerful residents seemed unaware.</p> <p>Indeed, if they deigned to care much about the white working class, they often expressed little more than condescension or outright disdain. As my grandma once told me, \u201chillbillies\u201d \u2013 by which she meant poor whites with some connection to Appalachia \u2013 were the only group of people that elites felt comfortable stereotyping and looking down upon. From MTV\u2019s chronicle of a \u201cwild\u201d white family in West Virginia to <a href=\"http://www.kentucky.com/entertainment/tv/article44150238.html\" title=\"\"><em>Justified</em></a>, a popular show about eastern Kentucky, the media\u2019s interest in the region seemed confined to entertaining caricature.</p> <p>The political system\u2019s response was even worse. While candidate Obama in 2007 secretly chastised poor whites for \u201cclinging to their guns and religion,\u201d the Republican party, where most white, working-class Americans made a political home, seemed completely unaware that its own base was struggling. In 2012, Mitt Romney ran on a platform that celebrated the noble business owner, even as polls showed that the white working class increasingly mistrusted the business owners perceived to push them from their work.</p> <p>And in late 2015, the party appeared ready to crown <a href=\"https://jeb2016.com\" title=\"\">Jeb Bush</a>, the scion of a wealthy family whose policy programme differed little from Mitt Romney\u2019s, even as his tone did. This was the brother of a man who started two unsuccessful wars, wars whose burden was disproportionately shouldered by the white middle and working class. And though a number of putative challengers offered stylistic contrasts with the younger Bush brother, no one challenged the core premise at the heart of his candidacy: tax cuts and deregulation at home combined with an active, military-focused foreign policy abroad. Just eight years after George W Bush left office to historically low approval numbers, the party appeared primed to double down on Bush, both in policy and in genetics. And no one seemed that interested in stopping it.</p> <p>Except for Donald Trump.</p> <p>In a now famous September debate among Republican presidential candidates, Jeb offered a robust defence of his brother\u2019s foreign policy: \u201cAs it relates to my brother, there\u2019s one thing I know for sure: he kept us safe.\u201d In interviews after the debate and on social media, Trump filleted Bush repeatedly, noting the failures of the war and even blaming Bush for his failure to prevent the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It was the third rail of Republican politics and television commentators predicated that it was the end of Trump\u2019s candidacy. How, many asked, could Trump survive such an aggressive criticism of the party\u2019s most recent president? Instead, Trump thrived, building on his lead in the polls and cruising to the Republican nomination.</p> <p>What so many commentators failed to understand was that the Republican party of George W Bush had changed. In the eight years since Obama\u2019s election, the white working class had grown angry: at the economy that failed to deliver good jobs, at the failed prosecution of two wars, at a government bureaucracy that failed to deliver good healthcare for veterans, at policy-makers who bailed out megabanks in the 2008 financial crisis even as many Americans lost their homes. The party didn\u2019t want another Mitt Romney and it sure as hell didn\u2019t want another Bush. It wanted, most of all, a man whose very existence is the opposite of everything prior nominees stood for.</p> <p>This was about more than finances and the macroeconomy problem. As a culture, working-class white Americans like myself had no heroes. We loved the military but had no George S Patton figure in the modern army. I doubt my neighbours could even name a high-ranking military officer. The space programme, long a source of pride, had gone the way of the dodo and with it the celebrity astronauts. We had lost any trust in the media as guardians of truth and consequently many were willing to believe all manner of conspiracies about our allegedly foreign-born president and his supposed grabs for power.</p> <h2><strong>In style and tone Trump reminds blue-collar workers of themselves</strong></h2> <p>To understand the significance of this cultural detachment, you must appreciate that much of my family\u2019s, my neighbourhood\u2019s and my community\u2019s identity derives from our love of country. I once interviewed my grandma for a class project about the Second World War. After 70 years filled with marriage, children, grandchildren, death, poverty and triumph, the thing about which she was unquestionably the proudest and most excited was that she and her family did their part during the war.</p> <p>We spoke for minutes about everything else; we spoke for hours about war rations, <a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/rosie-the-riveter-95-real-life-inspiration-iconic-poster\" title=\"\">Rosie the Riveter</a>, her dad\u2019s wartime love letters to her mother from the Pacific and the day \u201cwe dropped the bomb\u201d. My grandma always had two gods: Jesus Christ and the United States of America. I was no different and neither was anyone else I knew.</p> <p>Many in the US and abroad marvel that a showy billionaire could inspire such allegiance among relatively poor voters. Yet in style and tone, Trump reminds blue-collar workers of themselves. Gone are the poll-tested and consultant-approved political lines, replaced with a backslapping swashbuckler unafraid of saying what\u2019s on his mind. The elites of DC and NY see an offensive madman, blowing through decades of political convention with his every word. His voters, on the other hand, see a man who\u2019s refreshingly relatable, who talks about politics and policy as if he were sitting around the dinner table.</p> <p>More important is Trump\u2019s message. Implicit in the slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is a belief that one\u2019s country is not especially great right now and that\u2019s certainly how many of Middletown\u2019s residents felt. In the wake of the Great Recession, there was something almost spiritual about the cynicism of the community at large. If America was the lynchpin of a civic faith, then many in the white working class were losing something like a religion.</p> <p>In America, commentators have devoted dozens of essays and think pieces to the question of whether Trump\u2019s rise is primarily a function of economic insecurity or racial anxiety. The question is easy to answer \u2013 it\u2019s both \u2013 and yet not especially helpful. Donald Trump isn\u2019t just the candidate of economically dispossessed whites, though he is that. Nor is he just the candidate of racially anxious whites, though he is also that.</p> <p>He\u2019s the candidate of the man who opens his morning paper to find that another of his neighbours has died of a heroin overdose; of the woman who proudly sent her son to fight in Iraq only to watch it break his body and mind; of the father who spends hours on the phone with the Department of Veterans Affairs, begging for medical care that his former Marine nephew is owed both legally and morally; of the proud coal miner who voted for Bill Clinton and then watched as his wife promised to \u201cput a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business\u201d. Donald Trump is the candidate of a patriotic people who feel an almost apocalyptic apprehension about the future. His great insight was to recognise and exploit that apprehension.</p> <p>The tragedy of Trump\u2019s candidacy is that, embedded in his furious exhortations against Muslims and Mexicans and trade deals gone awry is a message that America\u2019s white poor don\u2019t need: that everything wrong in your life is someone else\u2019s fault. No one doubts that globalisation and automation have disproportionately had an impact on the white working class and no responsible politics should fail to appreciate and address that fact. Yet our neighbourhoods and our communities create certain pressures and instil certain values that make it harder for our children to lead happy lives.</p> <h2><strong>Trump\u2019s entire candidacy consists of pointing the finger at someone else</strong><br><br></h2> <p>During my junior year of high school, our neighbour Pattie called her landlord to report a leaky roof. The landlord arrived and found Pattie topless, stoned and unconscious on her living-room couch. Upstairs, the bathtub was overflowing, thus the leaking roof. Pattie had apparently drawn herself a bath, taken a few prescription painkillers and passed out. The top floor of her home and many of her family\u2019s possessions were ruined. This is the reality of our community. It\u2019s not just about hard-working people dispossessed by globalisation, though that\u2019s undoubtedly true for many people. It\u2019s also about a naked druggie destroying what little of value exists in her life. It\u2019s about children who lose their toys and clothes to a mother\u2019s addiction. It\u2019s about families torn apart by domestic violence and students afraid to go home when the school bell rings at the end of the day.</p> <p>Psychologists call it \u201clearned helplessness\u201d when a person believes, as I did during my youth, that their choices have no effect on their life\u2019s outcomes. We acquired that sense of helplessness from a number of sources: from families who felt that you had to pretend to be \u201cblack or liberal\u201d to get into an Ivy League school; from the home life that showed us the world could be turned upside down in an instant; from seeing so few of our neighbours succeed in the modern economy that we wondered whether success was even possible for those like us.</p> <p>To recognise that these neighbourhoods and attitudes affect us is not to place moral blame on the poor. Indeed, many of the obstacles folks like me perceive are quite real. But it is dangerous, even destructive, to give up completely on the role of agency. The white working class must build a set of values that recognises life\u2019s unfairness while constructively engaging with it \u2013 in our community institutions, in our government and in our families. Yet Trump\u2019s message for the white voter so desperately in need of introspection and self-reflection is: it\u2019s all someone else\u2019s fault. His rallies may be cathartic, as he screams and yells at conjured enemies, but he offers no solutions. His entire candidacy is an exercise in pointing the finger at someone else.</p> <p>In pointing that finger so repeatedly and enthusiastically, Donald Trump has debased our entire political culture. On the right, the party of robust American global leadership now finds itself apologising for a man who apologises for Vladimir Putin even as he scares our staunchest European allies.</p> <p>The Republican speaker of the house, a brilliant, respected leader, regularly repudiates some noxious statement of Trump\u2019s even as he cannot politically repudiate the man himself. On the left, the cosmopolitan elites of the Democratic party have taken to Facebook and Twitter to denounce half of their fellow citizens, people they rarely see, much less know. In the eyes of American elites, Trump\u2019s voters are racist rednecks, finally reaping what they\u2019ve sown.</p> <p>In this age of Trump, each tribe has lost the ability to show even a hint of compassion for the other side.</p> <p>The great irony is that the people who may make Trump president are among those who most need a constructive politics and an engaged leader. They need a life raft and a mirror. Trump instead offers a political high, a promise to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d without a single good idea regarding how.</p> <p>Hillbilly Elegy by JD Vance is published by William Collins on 22 September, \u00a316.99</p> <p>\u2022 Comments will be opened later</p>",
  "<p>The County Championship is heading for a thrilling climax, with a three-cornered fight for the title in the final two weeks of the season. Two of those teams, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire\" title=\"\">Yorkshire</a> and Middlesex, play each other in the last round at Lord\u2019s.</p> <p>To make it really interesting, third-placed Somerset, still in the Holy Grail quest for their first championship, need to beat Yorkshire at Headingley in the penultimate round of matches, which start on Monday. Middlesex, who are one point ahead of Yorkshire at the top of the table, face Lancashire at Old Trafford.</p> <p>Ian Bell, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/08/somerset-warwickshire-county-championship-division-one-match-report\" title=\"\">Warwickshire side were beaten at Taunton on Thursday</a>, is backing Yorkshire to make it a hat-trick of titles. \u201cThis is the strongest championship season I can remember,\u201d Bell said. \u201cWith two weeks to go it really is wide open.</p> <p>\u201cWhile we have a big final at Lord\u2019s to look forward to [the Royal London One-Day Cup final against Surrey], we\u2019re right in the mix at the wrong end of the championship table. But looking at the top end, if I had to pick a winner, it would be difficult to look past Yorkshire. They\u2019ve been the best team over the past two or three seasons and they have the experience of winning.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/16/jason-gillespie-yorkshire-county-championship-title\" title=\"\">repeat of Yorkshire\u2019s hat-trick success</a> between 1966-68 would give their director of cricket, Martyn Moxon, particular pleasure. \u201cLast year Jonny Bairstow really stood out for us with the bat, averaging over 90,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this year it\u2019s difficult to pick out any single player. Our achievement this year have been more evenly spread.\u201d</p> <p>Yorkshire\u2019s star-studded lineup \u2013 even without their England players \u2013 makes them favourites to beat Somerset and go on to take the title. But Moxon said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got some fantastic players but unfortunately names on paper don\u2019t win you games \u2013 we saw that on finals day of the NatWest T20 Blast.</p> <p>\u201cWe are one point behind Middlesex so the Somerset game is huge for us and they have shown some form lately. But the lads really want to get us over the line to give the coach a tremendous send-off [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/29/yorkshire-coach-jason-gillespie-stand-down-end-season\" title=\"\">Jason Gillespie leaves Yorkshire</a> to return to Australia at the end of the season].\u201d</p> <p>Somerset are likely to reinforce their batting and bowling by bringing back Jim Allenby and Craig Overton. They played three spinners on a turning Taunton pitch this week and it clearly paid off. But their captain, Chris Rogers, said: \u201cIt will be very different at Headingley. The seamers will have to do a lot more work up there.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re all big games now with two games to go and we\u2019re in a great position. It would be great for Tres [Marcus Trescothick] to win the title for the first time and to be a part of that would be pretty special.\u201dRogers and the Somerset director of cricket, Matthew Maynard, have a difficult choice to make between the spinners Jack Leach and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/06/somersets-dom-bess-takes-six-for-on-remarkable-debut-against-warwickshire\" title=\"\">Dom Bess, who made a highly impressive debut against Warwickshire</a>, taking six for 28 in the first innings and eight wickets in all, as well as showing ability with the bat. Rogers said: \u201cWhether we go with Dom or Jack, who has been incredible for us all year, it\u2019s going to be a tough decision. They have five left-handers in their top six.\u201d That suggests off-spinner Bess might get the nod. \u201cThere is something about Dom,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a little something in him. He\u2019s a little fighter. And he\u2019s a good guy in the changing room too. He\u2019s got a lot of potential.\u201d</p> <p>Middlesex travelled straight to Manchester following their victory against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge on Friday and their head coach, Richard Scott, said: \u201cEvery game is tough now but we are unbeaten this season, which is a record we\u2019re really proud of. It\u2019s been a great squad effort, with different players stepping up to the plate when required.And it\u2019s been a difficult year for us because we were losing 100 overs a game at the start of the season. But even when we haven\u2019t won we\u2019ve picked up good points.\u201d</p> <p>Scott agrees with Bell about the high quality of the competition. \u201cEngland seem to be releasing more top players to play for their counties, which can only enhance the quality of the competition.</p> <p>\u201cThere also seems to be a lot of talented youngsters coming through. Nick Gubbins has done so well for us opening the batting and then there is Stevie Eskinazi and Harry Podmore. Whatever happens this season the future looks bright.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Every major film festival is essentially an island \u2013 or at least its own self-enclosed microclimate \u2013 and the fact that the Lido literally is an island can sometimes make the Venice film festival seem entirely cut off from the outside world.</p> <p>This year, however, Venice felt like an integral part of the flow of the bigger universe.

Noah Oppenheim\u2019s script presents her story through that time-honoured device of a press interview (Billy Crudup is very good as the journalist), with Jackie talking us through the events in Dallas, her famous <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUP9gY_5MzI\">1962 TV tour of the White House</a>, and the shock of simultaneously losing a husband and her first lady status. The moment at which Lyndon Johnson is inaugurated, suddenly leaving Jackie an isolated figure on the sidelines, is magnificently poignant.

This religiose, abstract epic could be described as a prayer in images, and it will bring out the atheist in many a hardened critic. It feels like a bundle of trimmings from his <em>Tree of Life</em> \u2013 a rapturous assemblage of volcanoes, ice floes, creatures of the deep, the odd CGI dinosaur and an extended sequence showing the life of primitive man, like a slightly less hirsute sequel to the opening of Kubrick\u2019s <em>2001</em>. Along the way, Cate Blanchett recites \u2013 nay, intones \u2013 a poetic hymn to a universal \u201cMother\u201d (\u201cOh Life\u2026 Hear my voice\u2026\u201d). There\u2019s barely an image here that isn\u2019t magnificent \u2013 but put them all together and the result is cosmic kitsch.</p> <p>Intergalactic weirdness of a wilder kind came from the Mexican director Amat Escalante, whose name often promises festival controversy (Cannes-goers still speak with shudders of his ultra-violent <em>Heli</em>, known to some as \u201cthe Mexican flaming penis movie\u201d). <a href=\"http://remezcla.com/film/trailer-amat-escalante-the-untamed-clip/\"><em>The Untamed</em></a> is the most unrepentantly outr\u00e9 film here, about a working-class family whose lives are drastically affected by meeting a young woman and her nightmare lover \u2013 a tentacular alien being that embodies the pleasure principle at its intensest. Both distressing and compelling in its mix of HP Lovecraft ickiness and everyday realism, <em>The Untamed</em> got some unlooked-for laughs from a nervous preview audience. But it\u2019s a crazily audacious film \u2013 and no one who\u2019s seen it will touch calamari again in a hurry.</p> <p>While <em>The Untamed</em> is surely destined for cult reputation, a film that probably isn\u2019t \u2013 not least because it insists on practically flashing the words \u201cINSTANT CULT CLASSIC\u201d at you in scarlet neon throughout \u2013 is <em>The Bad Batch</em>. This wearisome piece of post-apocalypse hipsterism is Ana Lily Amirpour\u2019s follow-up to her superb vampire debut, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/24/a-girl-walks-home-alone-at-night-review-mark-kermode\"><em>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</em></a> \u2013 but she\u2019s disappointingly turned out a derivative, unpleasantly brutal desert-set fantasy about a young woman (scowlingly blank Suki Waterhouse) getting even after a nasty encounter with some body-building cannibals. Jim Carrey is unrecognisable as a silent, bearded hermit, while connoisseurs of dud Keanu Reeves performances will enjoy him in vintage leaden form as a Hefner-esque tyrant in a Burt Reynolds moustache.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"289badfe107ea8318ed32a5de4af4f6e4a2779eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/289badfe107ea8318ed32a5de4af4f6e4a2779eb/0_184_4979_2988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Timothy Spall, who plays a \u2018wheezy, lofty\u2019 Ian Paisley in The Journey, on the red carpet in Venice last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Timothy Spall, who plays a \u2018wheezy, lofty\u2019 Ian Paisley in The Journey, on the red carpet in Venice last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andreas Rentz/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Closer to the mainstream, there was <a href=\"https://teaser-trailer.com/the-journey-movie/\"><em>The Journey</em></a>, Nick Hamm\u2019s imagining of a car trip shared by lifelong opponents Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness before the 2006 Northern Ireland peace talks. It\u2019s a stagey, somewhat contrived piece, but the acting is a treat, and there are relishable comic touches in Colin Bateman\u2019s screenplay. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/timothy-spall\">Timothy Spall</a> is a wheezy, lofty Paisley, Colm Meaney is impish as McGuinness, and Toby Stephens and John Hurt excel watching from the sidelines as Tony Blair and an MI5 grandee respectively</p> <p>There were two great documentary portraits.

But it also shows the singer and his wife Susie Bick dealing with the recent loss of their teenage son, Arthur. It\u2019s an intimate, sometimes uncomfortable but never intrusive film, and Dominik \u2013 shooting in black-and-white 3D \u2013 sensitively matches the private life and the life of Cave\u2019s incantatory new songs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79498e89865f4a5e5e10f2011d1c6a3aadb28f34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79498e89865f4a5e5e10f2011d1c6a3aadb28f34/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor and writer Julia Roy with director Beno\u00eet Jacquot in Venice for the screening of A jamais.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Actor and writer Julia Roy with director Beno\u00eet Jacquot in Venice for the screening of A jamais.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tiziana Fabi/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Differently revealing is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/01/david-lynch-the-art-life-exclusive-trailer-for-the-venice-documentary\"><em>David Lynch: The Art Life</em></a>, in which the director engagingly sheds his aura as Weirdest Auteur in America to show himself as an enthusiastic, self-aware creator of paintings, sculptures and, well, things, and talks us through his pre-<em>Eraserhead</em> early years as an art student, bohemian and teenage rebel. You could never have imagined ever learning this much about Lynch the man, and fans will love him all the more for it.</p> <p>As for people making a mark in front of the camera, this has been a good year for new female talent.

  "<h2><strong>Netflix</strong></h2> <p><strong>The White Helmets</strong></p> <p>Half a decade in and with nearly half a million estimated deaths, the intractable conflict in Syria shows no sign of easing. This Netflix documentary follows a group of three volunteer workers handed the unenviable task of rescuing victims of the many airstrikes carried out during the war. It\u2019s a job that frequently puts their own lives in peril, all the while suffering from the unending worry that their own family members might also be caught up in the violence. A harrowing portrait, though one not without small moments of optimism, not least in the courage of the workers themselves.</p> <p><em>Available from Friday</em></p> <h2><strong>YouTube</strong></h2> <p><strong>How To Make It In USA</strong></p> <p>Joe Pera is a standup whose shtick is, essentially, a featureless voice. Conner O\u2019Malley is a stunt-happy comedian who employs self-consciously shouty pugnacity to devastating effect. Their webseries, in which Pera plays a hopeless comic and O\u2019Malley his hilariously charmless agent, is very funny and, once you get started, oddly compulsive viewing. In it, O\u2019Malley makes repeated (and apparently real) phone calls to cruise-liner booking agents offering Pera\u2019s worthless services while Pera road-tests absurdly dull jokes. Surprisingly great.</p> <p><em>Available now</em></p> <p><strong>Trump Dubs</strong></p> <p>Donald Trump is a man of many faces. There\u2019s Liberace Trump. Sassy Trump. Sophisticated Trump. Lairy cockney geezer Trump. And Peter Serafinowicz has them all covered. These voice dubs over the Donald\u2019s variously furious, paranoid and skittish speeches do a wonderful satirical job. The secret is that they\u2019re completely verbatim: by tweaking the style but not the content, Serafinowicz hilariously exposes the true bankrupt banality of Trump\u2019s vision.</p> <p><em>Available now</em></p> <h2><strong>Podcast </strong></h2> <p><strong>Laura Marling: Reversal Of The Muse</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a48adffb22c72f8ddd476f3295693967da6274ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a48adffb22c72f8ddd476f3295693967da6274ef/0_496_5341_3204/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Marling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Why are women so under-represented in recording studios? What difference does this make to the finished product? And what can be done to even things up? A new podcast with Laura Marling is an intriguing, questioning affair: the first two invite sound engineer Vanessa Parr and members of Haim to discuss their experiences. Neither po-faced nor trivial, this is a sensible, constructive and engaging treatment of the kind of everyday gender imbalance that needs to be addressed.</p> <p><em>Available now</em></p> <h2><strong>All4</strong></h2> <p><strong>The Unlikely Bikers</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s debatable whether people still regard bikers as terrifyingly delinquent figures. But if so, this cheerful webseries challenges the stereotype. The six short films introduce us to leather-clad menaces who range from vicars to estate agents. There\u2019s also a glamour model and a disabled woman who rejoices in the freedom of the open road.</p> <p><em>Available now</em></p> <h2><strong>BBC3</strong></h2> <p><strong>Obesity: The Post Mortem</strong></p> <p>In the interests of proving, beyond reasonable doubt, how bad obesity is, this doc follows a specialist pathology team as they conduct a postmortem on the body of a 17st woman who, it should be stressed, donated her body to medical science. What is the effect of fat on our vital organs? Grimly fascinating.</p> <p><em>Available from Tuesday</em></p>"
