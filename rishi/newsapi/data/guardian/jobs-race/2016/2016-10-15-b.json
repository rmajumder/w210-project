  "<p> Roger Hammond, the former one-day Classic specialist who is Mark Cavendish\u2019s directeur sportif at the Dimension Data squad, is confident that his protege will prove hard to beat in Sunday\u2019s world road race championship in Doha where the Manxman is chasing the second world road title of his career following his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/sep/25/mark-cavendish-road-race-championships\" title=\"\">victory in Copenhagen in 2011</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe beauty of Sunday, what\u2019s difficult to predict, is that you have to ask how he can lose it,\u201d said Hammond, who finished third in the Paris-Roubaix Classic in 2004. \u201cIf you control it as a team, you end up in a one on one with your sprinter and Cav in the finale. If there are cross-winds, well, winning the overall twice in the Tour of Qatar\u201d \u2013 Cavendish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/12/mark-cavendish-wins-tour-qatar\" title=\"\">took the race this year</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/feb/08/mark-cavendish-wins-tour-qatar\" title=\"\">in 2013</a> \u2013 \u201cmeans you are scintillating at riding in those conditions because you are in the yellow jersey and people are trying to get rid of you.</p> <p>\u201cSo it\u2019s very difficult to get rid of him as long as he\u2019s fit, meaning the only thing [his rivals] can do is make it so hard that you isolate him. The problem with that is that not many riders are good at that and you risk isolating yourself, which means you end up with the status quo.\u201d In other words, if a team attempts to toughen up the race and cannot leave Cavendish behind, there is a good chance that another sprinter, such as Andr\u00e9 Greipel or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/27/peter-sagan-mens-road-race-world-championships\" title=\"\">defending champion, Peter Sagan</a>, might simply have to tackle Cavendish man to man.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/sep/25/mark-cavendish-road-race-championships\">Mark Cavendish's world championships road race win puts Britain on top | Richard Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cavendish enjoyed a smooth build-up through September until stomach problems mean he missed six days of training at the end of the month, and pulled out of two races. He did, however, finish strongly in the Paris-Tours Classic last Sunday, implying that he is not far from his best.</p> <p>\u201cWithout that sickness you\u2019d be a fool to bet against him [for the World\u2019s] but now we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Hammond. \u201cParis-Tours was a good sign, people underestimate that race but he rode 250 kilometres and was at the front after a hard run-in.\u201d</p> <p>Hammond joined the Dimension Data team this year and oversaw Cavendish\u2019s successful campaign in the Tour de France, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/16/mark-cavendish-four-timer-30-tour-de-france-stage-wins\" title=\"\">he won four stages</a>. He added that the rider\u2019s form in mid-September at the Tour of Britain had been outstanding. \u201cHe was bloody strong there. We had to use him in a different way because Steve Cummings was in the yellow jersey, so everyone overlooked him. He saved the day for us several times.\u201d</p> <p>Cavendish was prominent in setting up Cummings, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/11/steve-cummings-tour-of-britain-biggest-win\" title=\"\">went on to win overall</a>, for what proved to be the key climb, the Struggle in the Lake District, but, said Hammond, there was more. \u201cThe most impressive thing was on the days when the other riders were attacking left, right and centre at the start, on several days Cav was our last man standing after doing 500 sprints to control all the breaks.\u201d</p> <p>Sunday\u2019s world championships course consists of a 150km loop to the north of Doha where the race is likely to be buffeted by the wind, before seven laps of the 15km finishing circuit on the Pearl peninsula, where a plethora of roundabouts and corners makes for a race that is technically demanding but completely flat. There have been issues with riders collapsing in the heat \u2013 Great Britain\u2019s Luke Rowe tweeted a picture of his handlebar computer displaying a temperature of 47.9C \u2013 and the extreme conditions are likely to play a central role.</p> <p>Depending on how they cope with the heat, Great Britain field a team which, on paper, is at least as strong as the one which dominated in 2011. As well as the Team Sky stalwarts Ian Stannard, Geraint Thomas and Rowe \u2013 who protected Chris Froome when strong winds hit the Tour de France this summer \u2013 sprinters such as Ben Swift, Dan McLay and Adam Blythe could provide strong support in a blanket finish.</p>",

While the competitors in this year\u2019s women\u2019s road race world championships will have their eyes firmly on the prize, the contest promises a host of potentially spellbinding sideshows and minor-key dramas. British interest will focus on Lizzie Deignan, the reigning champion, who is approaching the 134.5km course around Doha as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/14/lizzie-deignan-urges-cycling-world-governing-body-to-clarify-rules-on-theraputic-use-exemptions\">\u201cthe last weekend of a tough year\u201d</a> defined by her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/01/rio-2016-lizzie-armitstead-court-appeal-olympics\">successful appeal</a> against a doping ban in the prelude to the Olympics. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the controversy in which she became embroiled after missing three tests under the whereabouts rule has taken a mental toll on Deignan, and the noises emanating from her camp \u2013 not to mention the rider herself \u2013 suggest the combined effects of fatigue and an unfavourable course may be too much to handle.</p> <p><strong>But it\u2019s not all about Deignan.</strong> A flat course with no climbs will inevitably favour the sprinters, which makes Kirsten Wild of the Netherlands the woman to beat.

Ditto Marianne Vos, another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/27/lizzie-armitstead-marianne-vos-la-course\">former La Course winner</a>, who has no fewer than seven sprint victories to her name this year. And let\u2019s not forget her Dutch compatriot, Annemiek van Vleuten, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/annemiek-van-vleuten-intensive-care-olympic-road-race\">crashed out of the Olympic road race</a> in such horrific fashion but \u2013 having recovered from a cracked spine \u2013 is fit and raring to go again.

  "<p>First a thought. Now that Landon Donovan has shaken off the proverbial dust from his Galaxy uniform and returned to action, the league should probably consider removing his name from the MVP award. After saying goodbye to the game in 2014, MLS respectfully renamed it in his honor, but now after his return it seems slightly odd for a trophy to be named after a player who, despite his great success in the past, is probably not better than the candidates who might receive it.</p> <p>Namesake notwithstanding, Major League Soccer\u2019s MVP award is one of my favorite prizes in the world of soccer just because the nominees and winners continue to be so wonderfully diverse. Since the league\u2019s first ever season in 1996 when Carlos Valderrama won it with Tampa Bay Mutiny, we have had 10 different nationalities win the award. From Bolivia\u2019s Marco Etcheverry (DC United) to last year\u2019s first ever Italian winner in Sebastian Giovinco, it\u2019s refreshing to see just how many different nationalities represent the most sought after individual award in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/mls-latinos-hispanic-community-dna\">most diverse professional sports league in North America</a>.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/07/new-york-city-fc-mls-necaxa-mexico\">New York City FC head to Mexico for 'really special' date with Necaxa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As we discuss this year\u2019s finalists most likely to appear on the three-man ballot at the beginning of November, one thing is abundantly clear: this is a two-horse race. The incomparable Giovinco will never stop impressing us and 16 goals and 13 assists for the season so far are nothing short of superlative. But I just don\u2019t think the award will be given to a player who has been out of action <a href=\"http://www.espnfc.com/toronto-fc/story/2940247/toronto-fc-forward-sebastian-giovinco-out-for-a-month-with-double-strain\">since late August</a> and missed five matches in the process. Sacha Kljestan is an assist machine (17) and we should not disregard the value he offers to both the Red Bulls and the US national team as the 31-year-old midfielder was one of the only shining points from USA\u2019s draw with New Zealand earlier this week. </p> <p>This award, however, loves forwards (see Giovinco and Robbie Keane, the last two winners) and as the season winds down there are only two candidates who are worthy of the prize. As we wind down the regular season, these two stars know there is something much bigger at stake than an individual honor. Both teams, from the same city, are still looking to win the conference and indeed the Cup \u2013 and the fact that they represent a fresh rivalry make this debate that much more enticing. And in keeping with the trophy\u2019s diverse spirit, they are a south Londoner whose father was one of the greatest strikers in the English game and a pint-sized player from Northern Spain who is lovingly referred to as El Guaje.</p> <h2>Bradley Wright-Phillips, New York Red Bulls</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Bradley Wright-Phillips\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:33.3375% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BKTD5LTBoV9/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@bdubyas_view surpassed Chris Wondolowski&amp;#39;s @mls record with 62 goals scored over 3 consecutive seasons. #dare2BWP #REDTogether #RBNY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by newyorkredbulls (@newyorkredbulls) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-09-13T13:29:47+00:00&quot;&gt;Sep 13, 2016 at 6:29am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Forget about the fact that the 31-year-old Englishman is a contender for the Golden Boot award (tied with 21 goals with David Villa) and set to become the first player in MLS history to score at least 20 goals in multiple seasons. Or that back in May, while playing his 100th game for New York, Wright-Phillips scored a hat trick in the first 27 minutes against Toronto, the fastest from opening whistle in MLS history. Or that two months later, he broke another record by becoming the club\u2019s all-time leading scorer with 62 goals, surpassing the great Juan Pablo Angel. All that you need to know is that shortly after he broke yet another mark by scoring the most league goals over three seasons last month with 62 goals since 2014 (and counting), Jesse Marsch decided to give the ex-England U20 international the definitive compliment. \u201cListen, this is not taking anything away from Thierry, and obviously Thierry\u2019s the biggest name to ever play here, and is one of the best players,\u2019\u2019 Marsch <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/09/22/once-trialist-bradley-wright-phillips-never-imagined-hed-be-great\">said in September</a>, \u201cbut I think Brad is emerging himself as the best Red Bull player, the best New York MetroStars player, or whatever you\u2019d want to call it. He\u2019s the best player to ever play here.\u201d I would go as far as saying this season has catapulted him as one of the best ever strikers the league has ever seen.

Since the 7-0 atrocity in the Hudson River Derby, the Frenchman has created an atmosphere of consistency and resilience amongst the squad, a trait that is often needed with new teams entering a 20-year-old league. Players such as Jack Harrison and Steven Mendoza also have helped the cause, but make no mistake about it, this is David Villa\u2019s team and no other squad relies on single a player more. From a statistical standpoint, the numbers are impressive: 21 goals tie him with the aforementioned Wright-Phillips including four match winners. But what makes this 34-year-old World Cup winner truly one of the greatest ever strikers of his generation is his work rate. The man simply doesn\u2019t stop moving and it\u2019s this mobility and eye for goal that has enabled him to be the most dangerous striker in the league. This season Guaje hasn\u2019t gone three matches without scoring a goal: to put that into perspective, both <a href=\"http://www.espnfc.com/major-league-soccer/19/blog/post/2970782/mls-talking-points-who-will-be-named-mvp-in-2016\">Wright-Phillips and Giovinco have gone seven matches</a> or longer without scoring this year, albeit Giovinco\u2019s reasoning was also down to injury. But what this means is that Villa is the man you can bet your house on to score, no matter who you\u2019re playing against or who is supplying the chances. Before the season started <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/12/david-villa-new-york-city-fc-interview\">I interviewed Villa</a> and during our conversation he stressed to me how his goalscoring is a priority for the team\u2019s success and not for personal achievement. \u201cI score for the team,\u201d he said. \u201cNot for David Villa.\u201d As NYC FC make history by entering their first ever playoff run, it cannot be forgotten that it\u2019s all mainly thanks to David Villa, the man who was born to score.</p>",
  "<p>Hello, my name is Adam and I think I\u2019m guilty of being a self-serving arsehole. Truth can hide in full view. Bad things then happen because no one saw them in time. Some don\u2019t&#xa0;matter, but some, such as my selfishness, really do.</p> <p>Roll back to the weeks after Helen\u2019s funeral. I\u2019m packing for a trip to the US and Millie isn\u2019t happy. \u201cDo you have to go, Dad? Matt and I miss you so much.\u201d It\u2019s a scene that had played out many times when Helen was alive and was almost comfortingly familiar. So I went, as I always went, with family caring for the kids now that Helen couldn\u2019t.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I'm still using the excuse of the facile crap of business imperatives to take time out from my responsibilities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Always a nervous flyer, I would sit in business class quaffing champagne, fine(ish) dining and keep an eye on the engines. In the US, I would stay in swanky-wanky hotels, indulging myself as self-justified compensation for not being at home (a $25 bottle of bejewelled mineral water in one of Donald Buffoon\u2019s tasteless towers comes to mind).</p> <p>I am painting this vile picture because, after Helen was diagnosed but was still well, I think I was treating these trips like a mini-holiday from her illness. This nearly cost me the chance to say goodbye. I arrived home on a&#xa0;Friday to hear from her consultant. \u201cWe worried that Helen could have died on Wednesday \u2026\u201d This from nowhere, and more hit and miss news than it should have been. I\u2019d nearly failed to be with&#xa0;Millie and Matt on the dreadful journey of understanding and acceptance around their mum\u2019s deathbed.</p> <p>Now, months after Helen\u2019s peaceful passing with my holding her hand and talking of our love, I am still using the excuse of the facile crap of business imperatives to take time out from my grief and responsibilities. Why I see it now I don\u2019t know, but it is screamingly obvious and I hate myself. Before any kind, sympathetic soul thinks I\u2019ve done nothing really wrong, this is not even the bad bit.</p> <p>Far worse is the travelling\u2019s effect on the kids now that Helen has gone. When Millie says, \u201cWe miss you, Dad\u201d, she is sparing me the full truth of, \u201cWe miss you, Dad, but we absolutely hate someone else having to come to look after us because it re-sharpens the pain of losing Mum.\u201d</p> <p>So every time I make a yellow-bellied retreat under the guise of work, am I dragging the kids backwards to the grief of their mum\u2019s death?</p> <p>So complete is my sense of self-loathing that it makes the next bit a&#xa0;piece of cake. I\u2019ll never fly anywhere again for work or spend more than a&#xa0;couple of nights away from the children for anyone.</p> <p>I talk this through with a friend who works in HR, but not for my employer. \u201cYou realise you\u2019ll have no job?\u201d she says. \u201cClients won\u2019t make allowances, and your performance will drop off if you can\u2019t make the meetings.\u201d</p> <p>She is right, of course. My employers&#xa0;have been so supportive since Helen\u2019s death, but clients will reject a global bloke who fails to fly and&#xa0;doesn\u2019t deliver.</p> <p>The harsh but brilliant truth is that I really don\u2019t fucking care. Yet&#xa0;more bravado, but I&#xa0;really mean it. Cancer\u2019s masterclass in life\u2019s fragility, my insight into my own selfishness and the kids\u2019 upset, means it feels right because it is right.</p> <p>Counsellor Ruth looks at me wide-eyed when I tell her. \u201cAdam, your wife\u2019s died, and you\u2019ve bought a house, you are sweating it about your health and are choosing to endanger your job. Just how much more stress do you need?\u201d She sounds calm, but her eyes flash nutty-professor scale. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not. The die is cast. Awareness and self-loathing are powerful drivers and a new sense of purpose surges through me. I\u2019ll focus on nurturing the kids to be the people Helen hoped for \u2013 no less, in truth, than I promised her as she lay dying.</p> <p>I wonder what else I may be qualified to do. Maybe I will feel less gung-ho when money is tight, but now I\u2019m happy \u2013 this is the next step to our new life. One where grief lives with us, but we as a family will be tight enough to not just endure but thrive.
