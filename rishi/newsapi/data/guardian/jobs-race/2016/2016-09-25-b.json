  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s campaign chairman for police supporters in a key swing state, who was also a pilot for the Republican presidential campaign, has been fired from his job after the Guardian disclosed that he is charged with a violent crime.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/donald-trumps-police-officers-backing-republican-have-murky-legal-histories\">Donald Trump's police: officers backing Republican have murky legal histories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Vincent Caldara, a retired police officer and chair of Trump\u2019s Florida law enforcement coalition, will no longer fly vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence to rallies across the US. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/donald-trumps-police-officers-backing-republican-have-murky-legal-histories\">He is accused of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon</a>.</p> <p>Caldara, 55, allegedly drove his car at a man repeatedly, knocking the man to the ground, causing him severe physical injuries and leaving him with more than $200,000 of medical bills. Caldara has pleaded not guilty.</p> <p>He is also accused of seriously injuring a woman by recklessly driving his Harley-Davidson motorcycle into her, in a separate incident. The woman has sued Caldara, but according to court filings, officials have been unable to locate him to serve him with legal papers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://easternairlines.aero/\">Eastern Air Lines</a>, the Miami-based company that supplies Pence\u2019s campaign plane and pilots, confirmed Caldara\u2019s departure.</p> <p>\u201cMr Caldara is no longer employed by Eastern Air Lines. We wish him well in his future endeavors,\u201d chief executive Ed Wegel said in an email. \u201cEastern has no further comment on this to respect everyone\u2019s privacy.\u201d</p> <p>After refusing for several days to answer questions about Caldara, the Trump campaign moved to distance itself from him. </p> <p>\u201cMr Caldara is not a paid employee of the Trump campaign nationally or in the state of Florida,\u201d said Marc Lotter, Pence\u2019s press secretary. </p> <p>Lotter and other campaign spokespeople repeatedly declined to say whether Caldara remained part of Trump\u2019s Florida law enforcement coalition. But references to his involvement, such as a video clip that showed him opening a Trump campaign office in the city of Cocoa Beach earlier this month, where he addressed supporters, have been removed from the Florida Trump campaign\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FloridaForTrump2016/\">Facebook page</a>.</p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump and Governor Mike Pence are the law and order candidates,\u201d Caldara told supporters at the Cocoa Beach event. \u201cAnd if that is the direction you want our country to go in, then you know who you need to vote for on 8 November.\u201d</p> <p>Caldara did not respond to several emails seeking comment.</p> <p>Last Monday, Caldara stood directly behind Trump at a campaign rally in Fort Myers. As the Republican nominee praised law enforcement, Caldara took from his pocket what appeared to be a gold-colored law enforcement badge, and flashed it at the television cameras.</p> <p>Caldara worked as a police officer in New York and Miami but is no longer employed by a law enforcement agency.</p> <p>Police and court documents newly obtained by the Guardian provide more detail on Caldara\u2019s alleged battery of a business associate in July last year. The associate, Jeff Shanley, told police that Caldara struck him following a heated argument at their workplace.</p> <p>\u201cMr Shanley stated he stood in front of Mr Caldara\u2019s vehicle as he attempted to leave,\u201d according to the original police report. \u201cMr Shanley stated that Mr Caldara started that vehicle, then drove forward and bumped Mr Shanley.</p> <p>\u201cMr Shanley stated that he said to Mr Caldara, \u2018Come on, what are you doing?\u2019 Mr Caldara then drove forward again, thus striking Mr Shanley hard, knocking him to the ground. Mr Shanley got to his knees and was struck again by Mr Caldara\u2019s vehicle, knocking him down again.\u201d</p> <p>Shanley, who according to the police report was screaming, ended up under the front section of Caldara\u2019s dark blue 2002 Ford Crown Victoria. He was taken by emergency responders to North Broward medical center for treatment. A witness told police he called 911 after seeing Shanley struck by Caldara\u2019s vehicle for the final time.</p> <p>Shanley, now 53, underwent two surgeries following the alleged assault. He received a spinal stimulator and a fusion of his right hand, which he is now unable to bend.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/25/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-debate-gennifer-flowers\">Clinton camp says Trump in 'sewer' as debate looms and fight gets dirty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Caldara also faced accusations of wrongdoing while serving as a police officer.

Caldara was said to have been driving in Queens while off duty.</p> <p>\u201cA passenger in the back of the cab screamed at me: \u2018Hey!

  "<p>It\u2019s 6.45am at Camden ambulance station in north London, and the day shift is just beginning. Andy Donovan, who will drive the ambulance I will accompany for the next nine hours, is making me a cup of tea. His more senior paramedic partner, Dean Lowes, is running a few minutes late. When he does arrive, Lowes looks very sorry for himself: he\u2019s got an ear infection, picked up on a friend\u2019s stag weekend in Budapest. Lowes is the ambulance\u2019s first case of the day. They nip off to the nearby Royal Free hospital in Hampstead to get some ear drops. Paramedic, heal thyself.</p> <p>All this delays us for more than an hour, and we\u2019re not ready to \u201cgo green\u201d \u2013 telling the London ambulance service\u2019s call centre near Waterloo station that they are available for a job \u2013 until after 8.30am. Lowes, who along with Donovan is featured in the BBC\u2019s new three-part series on London\u2019s overstretched ambulance service, is suitably embarrassed. \u201cThis never happens to me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m never ill.\u201d But full marks for at least getting here. Crewing an ambulance is challenging at the best of times.</p> <p>Soon after going green, our first assignment comes in, flashing up on a monitor at the front of the ambulance. It\u2019s just about as unpleasant as it could be. One word: \u201cHANGING\u201d, and the location. It is a \u201cRed One\u201d \u2013 the top-priority call sign, meaning life-threatening. Lowes and Donovan\u2019s speed of reaction is electrifying. One moment, Lowes had been playing a Kings of Leon track on his mobile and saying how much he liked the band; the next, the ambulance is tearing south towards King\u2019s Cross.</p> <p>The call comes through at 8.49, and we get to the scene five minutes later. My heart sinks when I realise it is student accommodation. Two policemen are arriving simultaneously, and we all head up two floors in the lift to a stuffy, antiseptic white corridor. I go up with the policemen, who are bemoaning the fact their car was the closest to the scene. \u201cYou had a feeling it was going to be a funny day,\u201d one says to the other. \u201cYou said you had a feeling in your bones.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d says the other with a grim laugh, \u201cI should shut the fuck up.\u201d In situations like this, black humour is sometimes the only way out.</p> <p>Lowes, as senior paramedic, is first into the little study-bedroom. He has to decide if the student, who appears to have hanged himself, is dead, or, in the official language they use, to declare \u201clife extinct\u201d. It takes him just moments to satisfy himself that he is. The student is pronounced dead at 8.57. I can\u2019t bring myself to look at the body \u2013 the young man is fully clothed \u2013 for too long. What strikes me most is how peaceful he looks, and how red his hands are \u2013 the blood drains down to the hands and feet, a sign he has been dead for several hours.</p> <p>Within minutes there are half a dozen police on the scene, taking a statement from the traumatised fellow student who discovered the body, talking to the staff in the hall of residence, looking through the young man\u2019s possessions to establish his identity. It has ceased to be a medical emergency and become a police inquiry \u2013 and a personal tragedy for the family who do not yet know what has happened. It appears the young man, who was 23, was anxious about a dissertation he had failed to deliver. What a terrible, pointless waste.</p> <p>This is a shocking beginning. A suicide by hanging is rare. It is the first Lowes has witnessed. \u201cHe looked like a wax dummy,\u201d he says as we wait downstairs while he does the paperwork to certify the death. \u201cIt\u2019s when you see his passport and the picture of how he looked when he was alive that it hits you. That humanises it.\u201d Having been a body, he becomes a person. \u201cI try not to look at a dead person\u2019s effects too much,\u201d says Lowes, \u201cbecause you start to build a little story about them.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t go into it too deeply,\u201d adds Donovan. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff you lock in the box.\u201d</p> <p>A paramedic team leader turns up. He doesn\u2019t say so, but Lowes and Donovan know he is there for their welfare \u2013 to make sure that having to deal with the young man\u2019s death has not affected them too severely. \u201cIf you want to take a bit of a break, that\u2019s fine,\u201d the team leader tells them. They don\u2019t particularly, although they do have a fag standing next to their ambulance. The morning is hot, and people stroll past the student block, laughing in the late-summer sunshine, not realising that inside a promising young life has been extinguished.</p> <p>By 11am, they are ready to roll again. They go green, pressing the button that declares the ambulance available, and in a second \u2013 literally \u2013 their next assignment flashes up. It\u2019s another Red One \u2013 a cardiac arrest in West Hampstead, a couple of miles to the north. The siren screams, I lurch around in the back of the ambulance feeling sick, and Donovan swears at the vehicles that block his way, costing him vital seconds that could mean the difference between life and death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa5088d1e23f7f6ae33517af2778ef93098eb232\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa5088d1e23f7f6ae33517af2778ef93098eb232/0_164_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Call handlers at the emergency operations centre in Waterloo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Call handlers at the emergency operations centre in Waterloo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glenn Dearing/BBC/Dragonfly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The job is undeniably exciting, or at least seems so to me. Horrible, of course \u2013 no one wants to discover dead bodies \u2013 but also fascinating because of its unpredictable nature. You have no idea where you will go next or what you will have to deal with. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it,\u201d Donovan had told me earlier. \u201cYou never know what you\u2019re going to from job to job.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s like roulette, I suggest, and he tells me that is exactly what they call the last job of the day. If you go green with, say, half an hour left of your shift, the call centre will play \u201cred roulette\u201d. Instead of giving you a less urgent call (categorised from C1 to C4, depending on the degree of seriousness), they will give you something life-threatening. It seems mad, but the logic is that whatever you do is likely to take hours \u2013 every callout seems to generate a mountain of paperwork \u2013 so you may as well go to something that is worth your while. A practical, if heartless, way of looking at it. Paramedics often work 12-hour shifts, and I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like to get a final Red One at the very end.</p> <p>We get to West Hampstead in about six minutes. Another ambulance is already on the scene, as well as team leader April Barter, who has come by car. I bumped into her earlier at the ambulance station in Camden, and she was complaining about having nothing to do that morning. Now she has something to do. A man in his 60s has had a cardiac arrest \u2013 a heart attack in which his heart has stopped completely \u2013 and the struggle is on to save him.</p> <p>The man is lucky. I hadn\u2019t realised where we were when we arrived, but then it dawns on me \u2013 it\u2019s a bridge club, and dozens of middle-aged and elderly card players are watching the paramedics\u2019 attempts to revive their fellow participant. Even before the first crew arrived, some medically trained members of the club had starting giving him CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation), that pounding of the chest that aims to kick the heart back into action. Without their prompt action, he would be dead. The paramedics continue the CPR \u2013 by now his chest looks as if it has caved in, but apparently this is quite normal \u2013 and administer defibrillation, an electric shock designed to correct his heart rhythm.</p> <p>After half an hour of attention, his heart is functioning again and he can be taken to hospital. He is still unconscious, but has a reasonable chance of surviving. His bridge partner, who tells me they had just played a very successful rubber, offers to go to hospital with him, while his wife is given the news at home. There is an impressive calm at the club as the man is carried out. Who knew bridge could be an extreme sport \u2013 or bridge players so unflappable?</p> <p>A cardiac arrest involving two crews generates an especially large volume of paperwork, and we are stuck outside the Royal Free for more than an hour while all the forms are filled in. Soon after we deliver the man to the hospital\u2019s heart centre, Barter tells me he has regained consciousness. \u201cThe fact he\u2019s awake, his eyes are open, he\u2019s moving around tells us his brain has more oxygen. Although potentially it has been starved of oxygen for a short period of time, that\u2019s a really positive sign and it\u2019s a potentially good outcome for him. That\u2019s a massive lift for us. Good times.\u201d She says she is \u201cbuzzing\u201d. \u201cIf I can make a difference to one person in a day, then I go home happy,\u201d Donovan told me earlier. It looks as if he and his colleagues have made that difference today.</p> <p>It is that difference, rather than the material rewards of the job, that attracts Lowes and Donovan. \u201cYou don\u2019t do this job if you want money,\u201d says Lowes, who is 37 and comes from the north-east of England. \u201cIt has other benefits. You go home and you sleep at night. You don\u2019t take any work home with you. You might take some kind of emotional stuff away at the end of the day but, as far as the working day is concerned, once you\u2019re finished, you\u2019re finished.\u201d</p> <p>Lowes, who is a fully qualified paramedic, tells me he earned \u00a336,000 last year. Thirty-year-old Donovan, a friendly, buoyant east Londoner who is one rung below his partner in terms of clinical qualifications, says he earns \u00a320,000 a year basic, which rises to about \u00a328,000 with the inner-London allowance, rest-break compensation (they will typically work through their breaks) and overtime, lots of overtime. They are contracted to work 37-and-a-half hours a week, but can do up to 56. Without the overtime, they would struggle financially. The staff need the relentless pressure on the service to earn enough to live.</p> <p>The upside, apart from the drama of the job and the satisfaction of saving lives and helping people at moments of crisis, is the flexibility. \u201cThere are a lot of other things out there that I wouldn\u2019t want to do, sitting behind a desk being one of them,\u201d says Donovan. \u201cAt least in this job you\u2019ve got a little bit of freedom. Once you\u2019re out on the road, you\u2019re your own boss.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/mar/03/my-life-as-a-paramedic-when-every-second-counts\">My life as a paramedic: when every second counts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the paperwork for the cardiac arrest case is being done, I talk to Gary Nicholls, one of the paramedics in the first crew to arrive. He has clocked up almost 24 years on the job \u2013 Lowes and Donovan have each done seven. \u201cYou never know what the next call is going to be,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what keeps us interested. But it doesn\u2019t matter what comes down on the screen, we can always deal with it. The workload can be relentless, but your colleagues are there to get you through the shift.\u201d</p> <p>The London ambulance service was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/27/london-ambulance-service-special-measures-care-quality-commission\">put into \u201cspecial measures\u201d</a> last year because of a number of failings, including staff shortages, poor response times, lack of leadership and concern that the service was ill-prepared to deal with a major terrorist attack. The cynic in me thinks the BBC series \u2013 and my ride in the ambulance today \u2013 are part of the PR fightback, and maybe they are, but there is no doubting the commitment of the dozen or so paramedics and backup staff I meet. This is a service under pressure, but by no means one that has lost heart. Nicholls really does believe they can deal with anything, including his first job that day \u2013 chasing a naked man who it was feared was high on drugs across Hampstead Heath.</p> <p>It is already well past 1pm. The complexity of the jobs, the paperwork and the fact that you need a bit of a breather mean crews will only do four or five callouts in a nine-hour shift, and six or eight in a 12-hour one. Just before 1.30pm, Donovan and Lowes go green again. This time it\u2019s a Red Two \u2013 slightly less urgent but still potentially life-threatening, a woman in Kilburn with chest pains and breathing problems.</p> <p>She is sitting on the stairs of her house when we arrive six minutes later. She looks remarkably well, and within about two minutes of arriving Lowes has diagnosed an anxiety attack. She had a heart bypass operation five years earlier, and clearly fears a heart attack. She has already been to hospital for a checkup that day, and now wants to go back, despite getting the all-clear earlier. It is unlikely there is a serious problem, but Lowes and Donovan can\u2019t take any chances, so take her to the Royal Free. It\u2019s not their most productive couple of hours, but they talk to her respectfully, calm her down, deliver her to A&amp;E and fill in a fresh set of forms.</p> <p>It\u2019s now 3 o\u2019clock, and we\u2019re on our way back to Kilburn. This time they\u2019ve received a less urgent C2 call, after an earlier Red One to another fatality was aborted. The monitor in the ambulance advises \u201cman in his 70s with severe behavioural change\u201d. When we get to the flat, we find an elderly man close to collapse \u2013 probably through dehydration \u2013 and his wife at the end of her tether. She thinks he has undiagnosed dementia, and there are suggestions he can be violent towards his family, though today he can barely raise himself from the sofa.</p> <p>It is an example of the social work side of paramedics\u2019 work. They check him over physically, but he is in reasonable shape apart from the dehydration. What he may need very soon is a place in a care home. That is the shadow that falls across the conversation Lowes has in the corridor with the man\u2019s wife \u2013 the sad but all-too-common conclusion of a 50-year marriage \u2013 while Donovan talks to the man\u2019s son about sport.</p> <p>As their appearance in the BBC series shows, they are very good at being de facto social workers, counselling the anxious, the elderly, the confused, the demented. \u201cWhen I first started this job, going into people\u2019s homes took a bit of getting used to,\u201d says Donovan, \u201cbut because you\u2019re wearing a uniform, in the eyes of the public you\u2019re a goodie. You\u2019re welcomed into most situations, whether it\u2019s for social reasons or for emergencies.\u201d</p> <p>Lowes calls the man\u2019s GP, who promises to come round. For the moment, there is nothing more that can be done. More paperwork and another cigarette in the afternoon sun. The shift is drawing to a close, and the crew do not fancy any red roulette. There is a general callout for an ambulance, any ambulance, to go to Victoria station, where a girl has fainted. They decide it\u2019s too far and head back to base. That\u2019s enough excitement for the day.</p> <p>As we drive back to Camden, their monitor is reporting that University College hospital has been temporarily closed, St Mary\u2019s in Paddington is accordingly under severe pressure and the Royal Free is \u201cbreaching\u201d \u2013 A&amp;E is missing its waiting targets and patients are being left in ambulances longer than they should be. It\u2019s going to be quite a night shift, and Lowes and Donovan are happy to be out of it.

He spent 10 days in hospital and confounded the doctors by sitting up in bed within two days of the doctor\u2019s dire warning. \u201cI\u2019ll be back working soon,\u201d says the 72-year-old, before admitting that the doctors have advised him neither to rush back, nor drink.</p> <p>Set to celebrate 50 years working for the BBC this year, Simpson is not meant to be talking to the Guardian about his brush with death (he is saving that for a piece in a rival newspaper) but about his latest book.</p> <p>A potted history of foreign reporters interspersed with accounts from his own illustrious career \u2013 from travelling with Ayatollah Khomeini to Tehran in 1979 to entering Afghanistan in a burqa for wars in the 1980s and 1990s \u2013 Simpson describes the book as a \u201ctraining manual for a job that\u2019s virtually disappearing\u201d. </p> <p>He has no doubt that financial constraints combined with the rise of the smartphone has done for the sort of eyewitness, dusty-shoe reporting he and the heroes in his book have enjoyed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a217b66fbd03b28197b87af303cf95f9a7c719ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a217b66fbd03b28197b87af303cf95f9a7c719ff/21_29_1030_744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Simpson in Chechnya in 1998.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"722\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Simpson in Chechnya in 1998.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe money\u2019s gone,\u201d he says mournfully. \u201cI\u2019m sure that there\u2019ll be foreign news, of course ... But the grand tradition which goes back hundreds of years, it ain\u2019t going to go forward more than 20 or 30.\u201d</p> <p>He may agree that the book is a bit of a requiem and yet, his tales of midnight dashes and near misses during a conversation that lasts for two and a half hours is much more of a celebration.</p> <p>Rude about both government ministers and BBC management, he is too entertaining to pass for either. Swearing like a trooper, he refers to BBC managers as \u201cthe bastards\u201d or \u201cthe temporary staff\u201d and calls reports that he earns \u00a3800,000 a year \u201cfucking ridiculous\u201d.</p> <p>Yet he is BBC to the core. When he mentions how moved he was by his grown-up children (he also has a 10-year-old from his second marriage) weeping round his bedside, he admits: \u201cThey would have perfect right to feel I haven\u2019t put them first.\u201d What did he put first, I ask. \u201cThe bloody BBC! Nothing else. I certainly haven\u2019t put my wives or girlfriends first, God knows I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>His experience of the NHS in Oxford made him think of the corporation. \u201cI saw lots of similarities between the NHS and the BBC. It\u2019s all about management systems now. I think a lot of the doctors find that quite hard but, more than anything else, it\u2019s all to do with government intervention and interference, that desire by [ministers] to prove, to demonstrate that they have not only got a grip on the place but a foot on the back of its neck.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lack of maturity in politicians which makes them feel that their job is to battle the outfits that they\u2019re in charge of instead of saying how do we make this thing better?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a disgraceful political obsession that somehow or other the BBC has to be cut down to size ... it\u2019s absolutely stupid.\u201d</p> <p>Have the past two years, in which the BBC has fought to renegotiate its royal charter, been worse than before? \u201cIt\u2019s always been bad and it\u2019s not even a party political thing,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aac6ded18bf6bc713fefdb3b6474b81ba812d6e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aac6ded18bf6bc713fefdb3b6474b81ba812d6e5/0_17_719_559/500.jpg\" alt=\"John Simpson during the Iraq war.\" width=\"500\" height=\"389\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Simpson limping away from the scene of a friendly fire attack, with half his trouser leg blown off, during the Iraq war.

The latter\u2019s \u201cdodgy relationship with Rupert Murdoch\u201d provokes particular ire.</p> <p>\u201cTony Blair saying how vicious the BBC is to a man who has got no interest in Britain, who is deeply opposed to Britain and Britain\u2019s interest. Yet, here is the prime minister cosying up to that man against the main national broadcaster!\u201d</p> <p>In contrast, having interviewed David Cameron for GQ magazine in March, Simpson considers him \u201cpretty liberal-minded \u2013 he saw the value of having the BBC\u201d and he\u2019s reserving his judgment on Theresa May.</p> <p>One of the few things May and her new culture secretary have done since coming to power is insist that all those earning more than \u00a3150,000 are named in the corporation\u2019s annual report. Undoubtedly one of the 109 set to be identified, he brings up \u201cthis business now about how much people earn\u201d on his own. He doesn\u2019t \u201ccare terribly much\u201d, he says, yet he objects to the government \u201clooking for a way to demonstrate their control and domination\u201d.</p> <p>Admitting that he has earned more from books and columns, Simpson says: \u201cI fully accept you shouldn\u2019t join the BBC or work for the BBC in order to get rich.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not frightened of political control or bosses. I don\u2019t have Rupert Murdoch hovering somewhere over me. I\u2019m a free agent.\u201d</p> <p>In 2014, his annual 46 week-a-year contract was cut, although at the time it seemed to be a way of making sure he was always on the payroll. Yet Simpson is remarkably insecure about his future. Saying that director general Tony Hall could be \u201cgone soon\u201d, he quotes the Old Testament to explain his post-Hall fears: \u201cBut there rose up a pharaoh who knew not Joseph.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ca1a3120afbdb9ffaa6e171764c136bf79c464f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ca1a3120afbdb9ffaa6e171764c136bf79c464f/493_918_3910_2346/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Simpson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Whenever the BBC has told Simpson not to go somewhere he has \u2018always ignored them\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He even flirted with going to a commercial rival \u2013 likely to be ITV \u2013 two years ago before realising it \u201cwouldn\u2019t suit really\u201d. Earlier this year, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/27/bbc-john-simpson-consultancy-website\">scrapped plans to run a consultancy business</a> offering corporate clients his \u201cextensive network\u201d of contacts after the corporation said it would breach editorial guidelines. He calls the website \u201ca kind of a mistake\u201d set up by somebody acting on his behalf rather than by him.</p> <p>Simpson, who comes alive talking about being bustled across Syria with the Russian army this July (\u201cit was tremendous, enjoyable, difficult!\u201d), cannot be easy to manage. Whenever the BBC have told him not to go places he has \u201calways ignored them\u201d and tells the tale of being held in Syria for 24 hours after pretending to be an academic. </p> <p>His free-talking ways landed him in trouble when he was quoted describing BBC management as awful and full of \u201ctough women\u201d. He says the report elided two different points, but he wrote to senior female executives to apologise. Yet his comments that BBC staff aren\u2019t happy and that they treat junior staff members badly won\u2019t endear him to his bosses either.</p> <p>He uses his Irish passport for all the \u201cwild and woolly places\u201d where the UK is an enemy or where there is a risk of kidnap. The Irish government would be much more likely to \u201csee a PR advantage in trying to get me out,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the UK government would be glad to demonstrate their toughness and then no doubt send a junior minister to my funeral.\u201d</p> <p>I ask if there are any no-go areas, and immediately regret it. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere I wouldn\u2019t go! That\u2019s the job.\u201d</p> <p>He really wants to go to Raqqa. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not enthusiastic about getting my head cut off but if I could find a way ... \u201d</p> <p>He is equally horrified at the idea of retiring. \u201cNo no no no no NO,\u201d he begins. \u201cI\u2019ve got to earn a living and ... it would be the worst thing if I was some ancient character by the fireside.</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019m given the boot by the BBC, like Martha Gellhorn, I\u2019ll still carry on travelling ... I don\u2019t want to die, but I hope I will die with my boots on.\u201d</p> <p><em>We Chose to Speak of War and Strife by John Simpson is published by Bloomsbury, hardback, \u00a325.</em></p>",
  "<p>First came promises of a fairer deal for black talent; now comes a call for action. The London film festival is to put black film-makers and actors centre screen on the largest scale yet, and then come up with a plan to promote their profile in national cinema.</p> <p>The Black Star symposium, together with <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/black-star\" title=\"\">a Black Star season of films</a> that will follow the festival, mark an unprecedented push from the British Film Institute to promote black artists and acknowledge their historical exclusion from the higher-profile side of the industry.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want just to create debate here, we want to create an environment where things can actually happen,\u201d Clare Stewart, director of the BFI\u2019s annual festival in the capital, told the <em>Observer</em>, as she revealed the names of 15 British writers, directors and producers from black, Asian and minority ethnic (Bame) backgrounds who will receive intensive mentoring during the festival as part of the Net.Work programme. \u201cThere is feeling now that by concentrating on tactics we can really make things shift.\u201d</p> <p>Can such a drive to salute and evaluate black creativity really hope to redress years of struggle, limited funding for directors and a restricted range of parts on offer to actors?</p> <p>Joseph A Adesunloye, who is of Nigerian descent and is one of the young directors in the running for a new \u00a350,000 award for the best emerging British film-maker, pinpointed the problem when he spoke recently about the need for unexpected platforms, in this case the South London Gallery in Camberwell, for showing his work. \u201cIt\u2019s a really needed resource, to get African stories out there seen by the diaspora, but by others too. Because the important thing is just visibility; it breaks up this idea of this monolithic continent,\u201d he said. <a href=\"http://www.whitecolourblack.com\" title=\"\">Adesunloye\u2019s new film, <em>White Colour Black</em>,</a> will be shown at the LFF alongside films from <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/announcements/four-britains-brightest-new-filmmakers-shortlisted-uk-films\" title=\"\">the other three (white) finalists</a> for the inaugural IWC Schaffhausen Filmmakers bursary award.</p> <p>Coincidentally, the new ways into the entertainment industry necessarily being found by black talent are highlighted by the imminent launch of <em>Laid In America</em>, a mass-market offering which stars the black British comic vlogger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/03/youtube-urged-to-remove-ksi-videos-rape-trivialisation\" title=\"\">and rapper KSI, real name Olajide Olatunji,</a> the cult youth star who boasts 14.4 million subscribers to his YouTube channel.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlyenjHEmZE\" title=\"\"> Laid in America,</a> a raucous buddy movie co-starring fellow vlogger Casper Lee, is aimed at the sort of audiences that once flocked to teen comedies like <em>American Pie</em> and <em>Superbad</em>. The film, in which the two play high-school exchange students desperate to lose their virginity with the girls of their dreams on their last night in America, may not go on to win any arthouse plaudits, but it does demonstrate the potential commercial appeal of more culturally diverse voices.</p> <p>The BFI\u2019s Black Star project, trailed in cinemas over the summer, features John Singleton\u2019s 1991 film <em>Boyz n the Hood</em> and a re-release of the 1967 Sidney Poitier classic, <em>In the Heat of the Night</em>. But during the 12-day run of the film festival, now in its 60th year, work by black artists has been given serious extra space for the first time.</p> <p>The LFF will open in Leicester Square with the European premiere of director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/09/a-united-kingdom-review-rosamund-pike-david-oyelowo-toronto\" title=\"\">Amma Asante\u2019s <em>A United Kingdom</em></a>. Asante\u2019s film stars David Oyelowo in the true story of Seretse Khama, king of Bechuanaland, who in 1947 married London office worker Ruth Williams, played by Rosamund Pike, despite fierce opposition from their relatives and the British and South African governments. The gala premiere will be simultaneously screened at cinemas across the country. \u201cI\u2019m really hopeful we\u2019re about to segue from talking about diversity to actually doing it,\u201d said Oyelowo, who starred as Martin Luther King in the 2014 film <em>Selma</em>.</p> <p>The festival programme also features Nate Parker\u2019s new American epic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/26/the-birth-of-a-nation-review-sundance-slavery-epic-as-brutal-as-braveheart\" title=\"\"><em>The Birth of a Nation</em></a>, which won the grand jury prize at the Sundance festival at the beginning of the year. Parker, whose personal reputation was seriously dented this summer by discussion of a historic rape charge (of which he was acquitted), produces, directs, writes and plays the lead role in this harrowing account of the life of Nat Turner, the enslaved African American who led a slave revolt in Virginia in 1831. Fox Searchlight paid top dollar for the film, which provocatively shares a title with DW Griffith\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/jul/29/birth-of-a-nation-dw-griffith-masterpiece\" title=\"\">notoriously racist 1915 film</a>.

Other speakers include Jenkins and Noel Clarke, writer and director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/aug/26/why-noel-clarkes-hood-trilogy-remains-a-vital-snapshot-of-britain\" title=\"\">behind the \u201c\u2018hood trilogy\u201d</a>, <em>Kidulthood</em>, <em>Adulthood</em> and this year\u2019s <em>Brotherhood</em>, and Julie Dash, whose first feature in 1991, <em>Daughters Of The Dust</em>, was the first feature-length film by an African-American woman to be released theatrically in American and British cinemas.</p> <p>The symposium will be asked to respond to a new set of figures about Bame involvement in British film over the last decade which is being compiled by the BFI for the festival. Points already on the agenda include the obstacles faced by black actors in America and in Britain, the truth about \u201ccolour-blind\u201d casting, and the difficulties of finding funding.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to be able to build some strategies and work out how the industry should adjust to create the diversity we need,\u201d said Stewart this weekend. \u201cWe have already found that there is a strong correlation between what goes on behind the scenes and behind the camera and what ends up showing on screen in terms of diversity, so we have to open up opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>The powerful new documentary, <em>The 13th</em>, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/19/ava-duvernay-the-13th-documentary-new-york-film-festival\" title=\"\">Ava DuVernay</a>, director of <em>Selma</em>, will be the documentary special presentation this year. In it, DuVernay methodically tackles the history of race relations in America and examines how the US has produced the highest rate of incarceration in the world, with the majority of those imprisoned being African American. The title refers to the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution: \u201cNeither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States.\u201d</p> <p>For the new British black film-making hope, Adesunloye, access to funds and exposure remain the key issues, even with a voguish new transatlantic interest in telling the story of the African diaspora.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s got to do with who funds film and the kind of stories that they want to tell,\u201d he told a journalist at <em>Okayafrica</em>. \u201cFor example, <em>Beasts of No Nation</em> has been getting a lot of wonderful press but there is something problematic about the fact that that one wonderful story, which was written by an African (I haven\u2019t seen it, so I can\u2019t say) isn\u2019t made by Africa \u2013 or rather the director isn\u2019t African. But most importantly, the finance and the funding isn\u2019t African.\u201d</p> <p>Acclaimed for his short film, <em>Beyond Plain Sight</em>, Adesunloye\u2019s new film, <em>White Colour Black</em>, stars Dudley O\u2019Shaughnessy as a young mixed-race British man returning to Senegal to bury his estranged father. Born in Lagos, the director, screenwriter and producer is a graduate of the University of Aberdeen and the London Film Academy. \u201cWill African film-makers tell those kind of films differently? More problematic is why is it always stories about conflict or suffering that seem to get the most attention?</p> <p>\u201cReally, it\u2019s got to come down to funding. Africans have to find a way to fund stories that are about themselves,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>I admit my heart sank a little \u2013 only a little, mind you \u2013 when I first heard that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/15/whit-stillman-the-cosmopolitans\" title=\"\">Whit Stillman</a> was making a Jane&#xa0;Austen adaptation. A singularly literate comic voice in American cinema, he doesn\u2019t work often enough as it is: we can ill afford to donate his gifts to someone else\u2019s comedy of manners, right? Happily, I was wrong; in <strong>Love &amp;&#xa0;Friendship</strong> (Lionsgate, U), Austen\u2019s brisk sense and Stillman\u2019s wily&#xa0;sensibility make for about as perfect an&#xa0;arranged marriage as you could hope for.</p> <p>A quick, zesty take on Austen\u2019s novella <em>Lady Susan</em> that adores and embellishes her language with equal care, Stillman\u2019s film bridges the social and romantic politics of her era with ours. Beneath its whipped-cream quippery, it shows a very real and ruthless understanding of why we pursue relationships \u2013 for a multitude of reasons quite apart from love, friendship or even a compromise of the two. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/19/kate-beckinsale-phones-tapped-jane-austen-love-friendship\" title=\"\">Kate Beckinsale</a>, an actress too few film-makers have thought to challenge over the years, turns out to be an optimum fit for Austen \u2013 all surface serenity masking Stanley-knife severity. But it\u2019s Tom Bennett, so inspired and endearing as the most gormless of Austen suitors, who is the revelation here, finding exquisite possibilities for physical comedy amid all those impeccable words. Stillman, for his part, lets no opportunity for a laugh, however rueful, slip. Ang Lee\u2019s <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> remains the most&#xa0;gracious of Austens on film, but it\u2019s no longer the funniest.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-_HQ0bUzS8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z-_HQ0bUzS8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/z-_HQ0bUzS8\">Watch the trailer for The Nice Guys.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s a good week for film comedy, as it happens. The jokes in Shane Black\u2019s underworld odd-couple comedy <strong>The Nice Guys</strong> (Icon, 15) are certainly broader and bro-ier than those cultivated by Stillman, but they land just as deliciously. Black has always managed a surprising balance of brawny genre muscle with fleet comic footwork, and while this throwback effort \u2013 stewed in 1970s sweat the colour of tea \u2013 is a straighter, less subversive party than 2005\u2019s <em>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</em>, he still has considerable fun at the expense of Hollywood\u2019s most po-faced masculine archetypes.</p> <p>The character names are your first clue. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/russellcrowe\" title=\"\">Russell Crowe</a> is brutish enforcer Jackson Healy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ryan-gosling\" title=\"\">Ryan Gosling</a> is louche private eye Holland March.

Crowe and Gosling have a tipsy, hangdog chemistry that keeps Black\u2019s most clever-clogs writing from falling into snark, but that\u2019s rarely a risk. There\u2019s a genuine love here for the neo-noir tropes that&#xa0;the&#xa0;film so breezily inverts and it\u2019s never smarmy when it can be funny instead.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Kc5wy0Rxg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/f8Kc5wy0Rxg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/f8Kc5wy0Rxg\">Watch the trailer for Fire at Sea.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>We stop the laugh riot abruptly in its tracks, however, for <strong>Fire at Sea</strong> (Curzon Artificial Eye, 12), Gianfranco Rosi\u2019s subtly shattering observational documentary on Europe\u2019s migrant crisis, which examines life on both sides of the border with all the level-headed humanity we need in this ugly age of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/donald-trump-jnr-compares-refugees-poisoned-skittles-twitter-reacted\" title=\"\">Skittles analogies</a>. Concentrating its focus on the tiny Sicilian isle of&#xa0;Lampedusa, a key passage point for many North Africans desperate for a better life, Rosi\u2019s patient camera&#xa0;absorbs both the&#xa0;everyday and&#xa0;more extreme frailties of resident&#xa0;and refugee communities, resisting both patronising parallels&#xa0;and sanctimonious assertions of difference. It\u2019s graceful but upsetting viewing, perhaps best viewed with the&#xa0;relatively hopeful chaser of Netflix\u2019s 40-minute original <strong>The White Helmets</strong>, in which documentarian Orlando von Einsiedel (recently Oscar-nominated for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/22/guy-lodge-dvds-fury-serena-effie-gray-life-itself-virunga\" title=\"\"><em>Virunga</em></a>) ventures into Aleppo to study&#xa0;the work of the Syrian Civil Defence, a volunteer group charged with retrieving human life from the rubble. Gripping and more considered than sentimental, it offers an unfamiliar perspective on a crisis usually documented in entirely despairing terms.</p> <p>Finally, the pick of this week\u2019s rereleases come with an autumnal shiver. Jacques Tourneur\u2019s slinky, shape-shifting 1942 horror film <strong>Cat&#xa0;People</strong> (Criterion, PG) has been given typically immaculate Criterion Collection treatment. With a 2K restoration this lush, the knife edge between B-movie and capital-A art film has never been sharper.</p> <p>There\u2019s a further treasure in&#xa0;<strong>Early Murnau: Five Films 1921-1925&#xa0;</strong>(Eureka, PG), a fascinating, deep-cut compilation of the German expressionist\u2019s less&#xa0;celebrated silent work, from class-conscious&#xa0;murder mystery&#xa0;<em>The Haunted Castle</em> to smoky psychological reverie&#xa0;<em>Phantom,</em> a glorious apparition thought lost until a&#xa0;decade ago.</p>"
