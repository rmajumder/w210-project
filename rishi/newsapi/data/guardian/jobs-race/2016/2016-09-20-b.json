The one thing I\u2019ve learned in more than 20 years around politics is that convincing people they are wrong is a zero-sum game,\u201d Lewis says.</p> <p>He says the challenge is to work with people to understand what is driving their views, and \u201cwork with them from the source to win their trust.\u201d</p> <p>In his speech to be delivered at the ANU on Wednesday, Soutphommasane acknowledges the broader context of Hanson\u2019s resurgence.</p> <p>He poses two significant questions: he asks should Australians simply accept that a significant section of the community may be holding intolerant views? And should the response be \u201ckilling any racial ugliness with kindness, empathy and understanding\u201d?</p> <p>Soutphommasane rejects the idea that intolerance is ubiquitous, pointing out that 95% of Australian voters did not vote for One Nation in 2016. He says evidence suggests the vast majority of Australians are comfortable with multiculturalism.</p> <p>But he says the nation must avoid the complacency of believing that there may be nothing more Australian than intolerance \u2013 \u201cto believe that copping racism is just part of some initiation rite for any immigrant group.\u201d</p> <p>On the empathy question, the race discrimination commissioner says it should be extended only so far. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to discuss matters, including on race and religion, in a civil and respectful manner. Dialogue is always welcome. No reasonable person would disagree.</p> <p>\u201cWhere a reasonable person might disagree is where the demand goes further \u2013 where we should call on those vulnerable to discrimination to suck it up and be nice to those dishing them out,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThat demand doesn\u2019t make sense when such kindness and generosity may not be reciprocated. Too often, people can forget that the burden of racial tolerance isn\u2019t something that weighs upon everyone evenly.\u201d</p> <p>Soutphommasane will say several ethnic and religious communities have expressed fears about a surge in prejudice and intolerance since the resolution of the federal election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/16/if-you-want-a-response-from-the-muslim-community-first-understand-it\">If you want a response from the Muslim community, first understand it | Mostafa Rachwani</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI understand their fears.

  "<p>Black Americans today earn even less relative to their white counterparts than they did in 1979, according to a new report by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI).</p> <p>The report, released by the left-leaning thinktank on Tuesday, shows that the gap between wages of both black and white men and black and white women has widened over the last 36 years. </p> <p>Black men\u2019s average hourly wages went from being 22.2% lower than those of white men in 1979 to being 31% lower by 2015. For women, the wage gap went from 6% in 1979 to 19% in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cThe finding that stands out the most, our major result, is that the racial wage gaps were larger in 2015 than they were in 1979. That\u2019s huge because the impression people have, in general, is we know there\u2019s still racism in this country, but we think or at least believe that it\u2019s getting better,\u201d said Valerie Wilson, director of the EPI\u2019s program on race, ethnicity and the economy and one of the report\u2019s authors. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/household-income-increase-poverty-us-census-report\">Household incomes rose in 2015 for first time in eight years, US Census says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The EPI report comes a week after the US Census Bureau found that in 2015, median income for white Americans went up 4.4% and that of black Americans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/household-income-increase-poverty-us-census-report\">went up by 4.1%</a>. While everyone\u2019s income went up in 2015, a large racial divide remains. The median household income for white Americans in 2015 was $63,000. That\u2019s 70% more than the median household income of black Americans, which was $36,898.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47f168bef223e33fb2b32722d55e5ce3a34abb81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47f168bef223e33fb2b32722d55e5ce3a34abb81/0_0_3000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Race and median income\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Race and median income.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: US Census Bureau</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the main reasons that income for black Americans is not increasing at the same rate as that of white Americans is the starting salaries of college graduates within each group. According to the EPI, black male college graduates \u201cstarted the 1980s with less than 10% disadvantage relative to white male college graduates but by 2014 similarly educated new entrants were at a roughly 18% disadvantage\u201d.</p> <p>The report was unequivocally grim for black women, especially those who are young. The researchers found that the current wave of inequality has hit young black women the hardest. Since 2000, when the gap began widening, it\u2019s black women just entering the workforce who have seen their wages fall the farthest compared with their white peers.<br></p> <p>The wage gap between white and black workers is still at its largest between men. But since 1979, the gap has grown fastest among women. Thirty-seven years ago, black women earned only 6% less than white women. Today, black women earn 19% less than white women. Differences in educational attainment and other factors, like the fact that black women are more likely to work in the south, explain only a third of that gap.</p> <p>You can see this trend writ small among highly educated black women, Wilson said. At the beginning of the 1980s, black women with a college degree or higher and white women with a college degree or higher earned roughly the same wages. But today, wages for black women with a college degree or higher are 12.3% less than those of their white counterparts. That is double the disparity experienced by black women with only a high school degree. </p> <p>At the same time that the racial wage gap has widened, the gender wage gap has narrowed significantly. But the effects of racial discrimination have all but erased those gains for black women. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no question that white women benefited more from the narrowing of the gender wage gap than black women,\u201d said Wilson. </p> <p>She noted that in the 1990s, while the gender wage gap for white women grew noticeably smaller, for black women, the disparities stayed the same. \u201cBlack women are faced with both kinds of discrimination,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cAnd that racial disadvantage has basically limited their achievements in narrowing the gender gap.\u201d</p> <p>The EPI report released on Tuesday included some measures the US could take to close the wage gap between black and white Americans. The suggestions included increasing the federal minimum wage, enforcing laws to prevent \u201cwage theft\u201d and discrimination, developing ways to assess the role discrimination plays on wages of black Americans and a summit to address the low starting salaries of black Americans.</p>",

  "<p>Last week\u2019s labour force figures produced the best unemployment rate for three years but also a record level of underemployment. The two different measures \u2013 one good, one bad \u2013 highlights the changing working environment, and also explains why despite unemployment falling, the amount of slack in the employment sector means wages continue to grow slower than ever.</p> <p>It is certainly good that the unemployment rate in August fell to 5.6% in seasonally adjusted terms, and 5.7% in trend terms \u2013 both of which were the best for three years. All other things being equal (the favourite phrase of economists), a falling unemployment rate is always better than a rising one.</p> <p>But one problem with the latest figures is that the three-year-low rate occurred because since the start of the year a lower percentage of people have been in the labour market. The participation rate has fallen from 65.3% last November to 64.7% in August \u2013 a difference of around 100,000 people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/15/australia-didnt-have-a-great-recession-tell-that-to-young-people\">Australia didn't have a 'great recession'? Tell that to young people | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the unemployment rate is the percentage of unemployed within the labour force, this means that had the participation rate stayed steady, the unemployment rate would now be higher \u2013 around 6.3% in seasonally adjusted terms and 6.1% in trend terms.</p> <p>Now there is only so far you can go holding the participation rate steady, but it is undeniable that the current low unemployment rate is a function of both a lower participation rate and strong part-time employment growth.</p> <p>Since December, in trend terms, part-time employment has risen by 105,330 jobs, while full-time employment has fallen by 21,460 jobs:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Employment growth - monthly (trend)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/S4Yz8/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And with this rise in part-time work, not surprisingly has come an increase in underemployment.</p> <p>In August, the underemployment ratio \u2013 which measures the percentage of employed who wish to work more hours \u2013 reached a record 9.2%, while the underemployment rate \u2013 which measures the number of underemployed as a percentage of the labour force \u2013 also hit a record high of 8.6%.</p> <p>One of the odd things about underemployment is it wasn\u2019t much of a thing until the 1990s recession, and even then only really became an issue anyone really cared about in the past 15-20 years.</p> <p>Until the start of the century there were always more unemployed than there were underemployed; now it is the opposite:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Unemployed and underemployed\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Vcv1f/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> The reason for the increase has been the change in employment from full-time to part-time, and the increase in the number of women in employment.</p> <p>In 1986 for example, 93% of men were employed full-time, so it is little wonder back then only 2.5% of male workers wanted more hours. Now just 81% of men work full-time, and 7.5% of men are underemployed.</p> <p>Similarly, 30 years ago, only 48% of women were in the workforce, compared to 59% now. And not surprisingly given women are more likely to be in part-time work this has also seen an increase in the numbers of women willing to work more hours.</p> <p>And a big and often ignored change has been the level of youth in full-time work. In the 1980s, youth were as likely to work full-time as were adults, now there is a record low number of youth working full-time:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of adults in full-time employment\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Pt6sH/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> All these factors combined means that it is largely silly to compare underemployment levels further back than around 20 years.</p> <p>If we were to suggest underemployment was the best indicator of employment, you would be arguing that things are worse now than during the 1990 recession:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Underemployment ratio by gender\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7lV9c/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> But that said, the current underemployment rate does suggest there is a lot of \u201cslack\u201d in the current employment market \u2013 and it is a slackness that has increased in the past 12 months.</p> <p>In May 2004, the unemployment rate was 5.6%, as it is now. The underemployment rate was 7.1%. For the next 10 years the two measures largely followed each other \u2013 as the unemployment rate went down or up, so too did the underemployment rate.</p> <p>But that changed mid-way through 2014. First, the underemployment rate began to rise much faster, and then when the unemployment rate began to fall, the underemployment rate oddly kept rising:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Change in underemployment &amp; unemployment since May 2004\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/j6dWv/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> It means that now while the unemployment rate is where it was in May 2004, the underemployment rate is 1.5 percentage points higher than it was then.</p> <p>That is why the underutilisation rate (a combination of unemployment and underemployment) is also 1.5% points higher than it was in May 2004. And this is not just due to more youth working part-time, the underutilisation rate is higher for workers over 25 years of age as well:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Underutilisation rate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3G5ab/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/sep/06/the-economy-may-be-growing-but-it-sure-doesnt-feel-that-way-to-most-of-us\">The economy may be growing but it sure doesn't feel that way to most of us | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p> That the underutilisation rate has fallen in the past year is certainly a good thing, but that we now have a greater proportion of the labour market either wanting to work more hours or are unemployed than we did during the height of the global financial crisis highlights the weakens of the labour market.</p> <p>It means that any wage growth is likely to be muted for some time, as should any extra need for employment occur due to improved economic conditions, the easiest step would be to allocate more hours for workers rather than try to employ new people.</p> <p>There is no reason to bemoan the fall in the unemployment rate, but the rise in underemployment is likely to be an ongoing issue. And should the two measures continue to diverge, it will only serve to underscore the weakness of the unemployment rate at measuring the health of the economy. &#xa0;</p>"
