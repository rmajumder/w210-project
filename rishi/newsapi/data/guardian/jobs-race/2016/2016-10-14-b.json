  "<p>Being a doctor can bring many challenges each day. For women physicians of color, though, there is a special set of challenges that are seldom discussed or acknowledged in our profession or by greater society \u2013 until they come spilling into the limelight in a dramatic way. That is what happened on Friday.</p> <p>People across the country were horrified to hear of the way <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/delta-discrimination-black-doctor-incident\">Tamika Cross</a>, a doctor, was treated on a recent Delta Airlines flight from Detroit to Houston. A patient faced a medical emergency mid-flight and the crew asked if there were any physicians on board. Cross immediately signaled to the crew that she was available to help. But according to reports, the flight crew didn\u2019t respond as you might think. They weren\u2019t grateful. Instead, they doubted whether this young African American woman could <em>actually </em>be a medical doctor. They declined her help. </p> <p>For Delta\u2019s part, they issued a statement saying they were \u201ctroubled by any accusations of discrimination and take them very seriously. The experience Dr Cross has described is not reflective of Delta\u2019s culture or of the values our employees live out every day.\u201d Yet social media platforms have been flooded with dismay that the Delta Airlines flight crew reportedly responded in such an overtly biased way to Cross. How could anyone treat a physician like this during a medical crisis?</p> <p>Although female physicians of color in the United States are rightfully furious by this reported act of bias, this incident is far from isolated. Generations of female physicians of color can all share similar stories where they have been openly challenged. Everyday a physician similar to Cross goes to work and faces individuals who are truly shocked and unable to accept that the woman before them is a doctor. Their experiences go largely unrecorded and unacknowledged because they have never had the media attention that the Delta Airlines incident attracted.</p> <p>These controversies also touch on deeper concerns surrounding communities of color and healthcare. We face a different health reality than other populations within the United States. We face greater rates of disease, disability and early death compared with other populations. As an example, African American women are less likely to get breast cancer but far more likely to die from it. And African American female physicians make up less than 2% of the physician workforce in the United States. </p> <p>Although our numbers are growing, we are nowhere near reaching the numbers necessary to ensure the diverse physician workforce that the rapidly diversifying population of the United States requires. This lack of diversity continues to hurt the quality of care historically underserved and underrepresented communities receive. Incidents such as this one can have a chilling effect on recruiting the next generation of diverse physicians we need.</p> <p>This moment of outrage will help shine a light on this problem \u2013 but it will be too brief. People will share their disgust on Facebook and Twitter but that alone is not enough to solve the issue. The way in which the Delta Airlines flight crew quickly dismissed Cross\u2019s qualifications demonstrated how deep-rooted issues of race and gender are embedded in our national consciousness. To solve this problem will require a willingness by all Americans to discard their preconceived stereotypes and biases. We need to <em>collectively</em> embrace Cross and her sisters in medicine as the well-trained, qualified and compassionate physicians that we are. </p> <p>Old and bitter racial and gender stereotypes continue to exist and flourish in America today. We wish that Cross\u2019s experience with the Delta Airlines flight crew were out of the norm and not representative of our collective experience \u2013 but it isn\u2019t. We are outraged by what happened to Cross, we expect justice for her. We will not be deterred from our calling in life: to serve our patients just as the trailblazing female physicians of color who came before us did.</p>",

  "<p>On 15 October 1966 Huey P Newton and Bobby Seale founded the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/03/black-panthers-vanguard-revolution-film\" title=\"\">Black Panther Party for Self-Defense</a> in Oakland, California. The Panthers quickly became one of the most important and well-known black radical organisations, inspiring chapters across the US and around the world. Fifty years on, the legacy of the Panthers is particularly important given the resurgence of black political action and the rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a> on both sides of the Atlantic. The Panthers are largely remembered for their gun-toting public displays and revolutionary rhetoric; but the true legacy of the party is the grassroots community activism that defined them.</p> <p>The image of the Panthers marching into the state capitol building in California armed with shotguns, in 1967, shocked America to the same degree it inspired black communities. The Panthers believed in armed self-defence and \u201cpatrolled\u201d the police, observing them during stops in black communities. This, unsurprisingly, led to confrontations, shootouts and arrests, as well as high-profile trials against Panthers including Newton. The campaigns to free the Panthers and raise money for legal defence are the basis of the collective memory of the party. However, the reality of their work was not these direct and sometimes symbolic confrontations.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One of the first successes of the Panthers was to get a traffic light put up where children had been knocked down</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The main work of the Panthers was in coordinating \u201csurvival programmes\u201d that offered support to poor African-Americans that the state would not. The \u201cfree breakfast for schools\u201d programme was feeding 20,000 children a day at its peak; the free health clinics treated tens of thousands of people; and they also started their own \u201cliberation schools\u201d to counter racist schooling. It was this community organising that embedded the Panthers in the community, not the guns and shootouts. One of the first successes of the Panthers was campaigning to get a traffic light put up on a busy intersection in Oakland, where children had been knocked down. The main lessons for organisations as they develop in Britain is that activism is not judged by big showpieces that gain media attention; but the mundane organising that organically links movements to the communities they are trying to serve.</p> <p>In Britain there is a rich historical legacy to draw upon, which has largely been forgotten. The British Black Panthers started in 1968 and included people like Dr Althea Jones-Lecointe, Olive Morris and <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/neil-kenlocks-photos-give-the-british-black-panthers-the-legacy-they-deserve\" title=\"\">photographer-in-chief Neil Kenlock</a>. The British Panthers did not condone gun use and focused on community education and anti-racist campaigns. They are part of a lost legacy of black radical activism that has strong roots in Britain. As new movements develop it is important to make connections and draw lessons from what has gone before.</p> <p>Contrary to popular mythology, the Panthers in America were 60% female and featured prominent roles for women. This was particularly true in the British movement, which had strong female leadership and groups that sprang out of it such as the Black Women\u2019s Group in 1973. Black women have been erased from the narrative of black activism and it is important we rediscover that history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2008/oct/28/emory-douglas-black-panther\">The revolutionary art of Emory Douglas, Black Panther</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Panthers have also helped sustain today\u2019s movements. Their first creative fundraising activity was to sell copies of Mao\u2019s Little Red Book to college students, and they published the Black Panther newspaper, which sold for 10 cents per copy with a peak circulation of 250,000 a week. The Panthers also raised funds from white allies and the state, but they understood that a movement cannot be independent unless it can raise its own funds. Whoever finances a group owns the organisation and this will be key as movements progress in Britain.</p> <p>The newspaper was important in disseminating the political messages of the party. Mass circulation meant they had reach beyond their membership in black communities. Emory Douglas\u2019s artwork was the perfect vehicle for spreading the ideas of the Panthers, for instance his iconic depiction of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2008/oct/28/emory-douglas-black-panther\" title=\"\">the police as pigs</a>. Black Lives Matter has harnessed the power of social media, but this cannot replace the physical paper, which reaches the places the internet cannot. The presence of the Panthers selling the paper and engaging with the community was also important to embedding the movement at the grassroots. The revolution will not be retweeted, it will be led from the ground up by the communities who need it most.</p> <p>The overt confrontations with police led to the Panthers being financially drained by legal fees and brutally assaulted by the state. This unfortunately led to the downfall of the movement and detracted from the grassroots activism the Panthers were leading. Today\u2019s movements should remember that high-profile confrontations do not sustain an organisation, the first goal must be to root the struggle in the daily lives of black communities.</p>",

However, as an \u201cAsian\u201d actor, I was only seen for certain parts: beating people up; getting beaten up; dealing drugs; owning a cornershop; being a doctor. At auditions, I often heard, \u201cThat\u2019s good, but can you do it with an accent?\u201d I wasn\u2019t born in Asia and neither were my parents. I actually come from Trinidad and Tobago, in the Caribbean. But try finding \u201cIndo or Asian-Caribbean\u201d on any form asking for my ethnicity. But I\u2019m English and proud.</p> <p>I had been out of drama school four years when I realised that, rather than bellyaching about it, if I wanted to see change, I should endeavour to be the change.

But the point of that romcom was to give two leads to non-white actors, where their roles were not governed by their colour. For many reasons beyond my control, the film never got distributed. After years of only being put forward for stereotyped roles, I got out of the industry. It wasn\u2019t enough for me to be paid as an actor, but lose my soul in the doing. After that, I managed to land a highly sought-after place at the National Film and Television School as a screenwriter, intent on trying to make the changes at script level. I wrote a play exploring these issues called That Paki Play.

I have failed to make any dent, any career, even. All I have done is get older.</p> <p>I refuse to bow down and get bitter about it \u2013 or quit, because what is the point in that? But no one wants to hear your story, just putting it down to bad luck or a lack of ability, rather than an impermeable, frustrating wall, where every time you are considered for a job, it is only because of your perceived culture and colour.</p> <p>But this situation has to change, not just for black actors, but for all minorities. There\u2019s been recent talk of a <a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-11-24/should-any-self-respecting-black-actor-be-playing-james-bond-asks-007-star-hugh-quarshie\" title=\"\">black James Bond</a>; fabulous. But where is there mention of an Asian one? What, after all, is the difference? Only in perception. I fervently believe that if we were allowed to start telling our stories, not only would we be creating jobs for actors of colour, we would also be creating role-models for our younger generation and we would be educating our own population about who Britain is now and how it got to be so.</p> <p>Surely there has never been a better time to start being inclusive, to start educating those that are ignorant, than now. And I speak of the gatekeepers.</p>",
  "<p>This morning I woke up to the news that Bob Dylan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/13/bob-dylan-wins-2016-nobel-prize-in-literature\">had won the Nobel prize in literature</a>. What\u2019s even more galling than the fact that a singer has won an award for a literary prize is that people are calling this radical, a breath of fresh air from an otherwise stuffy institution, inspired, unconventional. Dylan has been awarded the prize for \u201cfor having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\u201d. </p> <p>As soon after the award was announced, the permanent secretary of the Swedish academy, Sara Danius, said it had \u201cnot been a difficult decision\u201d, and she hoped the academy would not be criticised.</p> <p>But of course it will be criticised, and it should be. Giving the award to any white male writer, no matter what form he writes in, is in no way innovative or inspired. It is simply a return to the status quo \u2013 albeit in a different genre. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/from-the-archive-blog/2016/oct/13/chimes-of-freedom-guardian-dylan-poetry-1965\">The poetry of Bob Dylan - from the Guardian archive, April 1965</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-bob-dylan-deserves-his-nobel-prize-in-literature-67017\">In his article for the Conversation</a>, Richard Brown wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more prominent living figure in American culture \u2013 perhaps even world culture \u2013 than Bob Dylan, or one whose work combines a more richly poetic and surreal artistry in its vision of the contemporary world, a more iconoclastic sense of social justice, more notes of personal intimacy or such a dry and acute sense of humour.\u201d It makes me wonder if Brown has heard of Toni Morrison, Margaret Atwood or Elena Ferrante.</p> <p>The Nobel prize in literature is infamous for its conventionality and the limits of its imagination. In its 115-year history, only 14 women have been awarded the prize, and only four of those women have been writers of colour. The Nobel prize has one of the worst gender ratios in any major literary award, which is troubling given that its internationality means that it is viewed as the most prestigious literary award around. Prizes are subjective measures, but they are important: they reinforce the standards of great writing in our culture, with a focus on quality rather than popularity.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/11/nobel-prize-literature-betting-odds-don-delillo-murakami-thiongo\">The Guardian listed</a> Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o, Don DeLillo and Haruki Murakami as favourites to win the prize this year \u2013 and all of those would have been a better choice than Dylan. There are also plenty of women, accomplished novelists, essayists and memoirists who could have won. </p> <p>What about Atwood, who has written poetry, fiction and non-fiction, and whose work has been endlessly republished, studied around the world, and awarded major prizes for decades? Or Joyce Carol Oates, who has published more than 40 books of fiction as well as novellas, plays, poetry collections, short stories and non-fiction? </p> <p>Or, if the Nobel committee really wanted to be radical, it might have given the award to Ferrante, who has achieved incredible commercial appeal for books that examine the sexism and classism of Italy in the 20th century. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/13/bob-dylan-deserves-to-win-nobel-prize-literature\">Why Bob Dylan deserves his Nobel literature win</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is particularly infuriating that the last American author to receive the Nobel prize in literature was Morrison, whose work enlarges all the possible definitions of literature and who stretches language and narrative to breaking points. That Dylan should be the next American to win after Morrison is an enormous step backward.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/arts/music/bob-dylan-nobel-prize-literature.html?_r=0\">The New York Times reported:</a> \u201cIn choosing a popular musician for the literary world\u2019s highest honour, the Swedish academy, which awards the prize, dramatically redefined the boundaries of literature.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s interesting to wonder whether a female songwriter would ever be elevated to Dylan\u2019s height; whether we would \u201cdramatically redefine the boundaries of literature\u201d to celebrate a woman who could so eloquently sing about the issues that plagued a generation.</p> <p>Dylan wins his Nobel in the same year that the prize is not awarded to any women across any of its fields, which seems hardly believable. But what is particularly frustrating about Dylan\u2019s win is that it is being packaged as revolutionary, as a means of breaking from tradition, when it is anything but. </p> <p>Giving the award to yet another white, distinguished male over more qualified women is exactly the status quo. It proves, once again, how the times just aren\u2019t a-changin\u2019.</p>",

We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy\u2019s own insights. Here is the latest dilemma \u2013 what are your thoughts?</strong></p> <p>My daughter works for the probation service. She started as a part-time receptionist, and had a long commute, but early in the spring was accepted for a full-time post supporting clients in her home town. </p> <p>The job has been bedevilled from the start. Firstly, the company took well over six months to relocate her, arguing that they were designing the job package as it was a new post. She then discovered that the post was designed for probation service users, to reintroduce a workplace experience. </p> <p>My daughter is not a \u201cservice user\u201d and has therefore been placed in a false position.</p> <p>After completing three weeks\u2019 training, she has now been placed in the local office, where she is given nothing to do. She has been told that she cannot offer to help other staff in any way, as that is not her job. When she tried to help a colleague with new computer protocol that my daughter was familiar with, she was immediately reprimanded.</p> <p>Her manager has simply said she should \u201cresearch training opportunities on the internet\u201d.</p> <p>She desperately wants to leave, which is a shame as she entered the probation service with a keen desire to work with clients. Her position is further weakened by the fact that her new role is only a short contract, whereas her previous role (taken before the probation service was privatised) was a permanent contract.</p> <p><strong>Do you need advice on a work issue?
