  "<p>More than four in 10 young women believe their gender will count against them during their career, according to a survey that found only 4% of boys believe they might also face some form of career-limiting sex discrimination in the workplace.</p> <p>The poll for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) reported that 41% of young women, all aged between 13 and 22, believed discrimination would hold back their careers, more than 10 times the figure for boys.</p> <p>Approximately 20% of boys not only rejected concerns they might face discrimination, they said their gender would have a positive effect on their career, allowing them to earn more than their female counterparts.</p> <p>The survey follows a series of reports showing that women face a higher risk of harassment and discrimination at work. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/sexual-harassment-at-work-getting-worse\">A recent TUC study found that more than half of all women</a> and nearly two-thirds of women aged 18 to 24 said they have experienced sexual harassment at work. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/14/asda-equal-pay-shopfloor-staff-women\">Workers recently won the right to lodge a sex discrimination claim against Asda</a> that could force the supermarket chain to adjust the pay of many of its 130,000 shop floor staff and make back payments to those involved in the case going back to 2002, at an estimated cost of up to \u00a3100m. </p> <p>The building industry was singled out by young women as one of the worst offenders that was ripe for change, according to the survey.<br></p> <p>A quarter of young women said that employing a diverse range of people was the most important factor when thinking about a company they would work for. They said it would take a female chief executive or a successful female prime minister to turn the situation around.</p> <p>The Rics chief executive, Sean Tompkins, said the survey showed that senior executives needed to take responsibility for changing attitudes. Tompkins said his first move would be to avoid speaking on conference platforms that only featured men, which he said was common in the building industry.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a big responsibility on male executives to understand the unconscious biases that discriminate against women and use that knowledge to change the culture in their organisations,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are starting to see a rise in the number of young women in the sector, but not necessarily emerging as spokespeople,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Only 13% of qualified surveyors in the UK are women compared with a 15% global total of Rics members.

But that nice improvement is all gone now.

And certainly the lack of youth in full-time work is dragging down the overall figures, but the picture for those prime-aged workers is not real flash either.</p> <p>Over the past 30 years, annual full-time employment growth for prime-aged workers has averaged 1.7%. But in the past five years, growth has only been above that level for five months.

  "<p>One of the things that attracted Fitzalbert Taylor to becoming a coal miner was the warmth. \u201cIt was like I\u2019d emigrated to a different country down there,\u201d says the 88-year-old. \u201cIt was so warm. When I was in the building trade, I couldn\u2019t feel my arms or my legs \u2013 donkey jacket, two pairs of trousers and you were still cold.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor moved to the UK from Jamaica in 1954 when he was 26, and spent 25 years working as a miner. Now he has joined about 20 men who are involved in a project that aims to record the experiences of black miners in the UK \u2013 Coal Miners of African Heritage: Narratives from Nottinghamshire.</p> <p>The project will produce a collection of audio recordings and oral histories, along with a booklet to help preserve and share the miners\u2019 stories. The initiative\u2019s founder, historian Norma Gregory, says the role black miners played in the history of British mining industry has been badly neglected. \u201cI\u2019ve searched through so many books, films and archives, with the help of volunteers, and I\u2019ve found very few mentions of miners of other nationalities,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"09b951c7d309b95a5715542f1913bc9f8db9a812\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09b951c7d309b95a5715542f1913bc9f8db9a812/216_0_2767_3456/801.jpg\" alt=\"Lincoln Cole, Gedling miner 1965-1987, father of ex-England footballer Andy Cole.

There are no reliable records of how many non-white miners worked in British mines but Gregory estimates that between the early 50s and the late 80s there were nearly 1,000 men of African-Caribbean origin working in Nottinghamshire mines at any one time. Collieries did not keep records of workers\u2019 ethnicity, and when pits started closing in the 1980s personnel documents were often destroyed, leaving researchers like Gregory to rely on former miners to suggest possible interviewees.</p> <p>Garrey Mitchell started working at Gedling colliery in Nottingham in 1975, aged 17, and worked there until 1986, when he left to start his own business. He got the job because the manager had known his father, who was also a miner, and who had emigrated from Jamaica in the early 50s. \u201cWe were very united down there. You had to be,\u201d says Mitchell. \u201cYou had to watch each others\u2019 backs. Colour didn\u2019t come into it. We were all on one level.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdfc2080f1d41dab9b55275e507db435d52759b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdfc2080f1d41dab9b55275e507db435d52759b7/0_121_1075_645/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gedling miners.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gedling miners.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nottingham Post</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lincoln Cole, 83, father of the ex-England footballer Andy Cole, worked at Gedling from 1965-87, after he left Jamaica in 1957. \u201cI enjoyed mining, because you got to make friends,\u201d he says. \u201cIf a finger got crushed, there would be somebody there to come and give you a helping hand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnce you came back on to the surface and had a shower, then the white folks would stick to themselves and the black folks would stick to themselves,\u201d says Mitchell. \u201cBut when you were down there, you were automatically united, because you knew you were all in the same boat.\u201d</p> <p>Gedling colliery \u2013 where many of Gregory\u2019s interview subjects worked \u2013 employed men from 15 countries and was described as the \u201cpit of nations\u201d in a 1967 Daily Mirror report. In the 60s, 10% of the pit\u2019s 1,400-strong workforce was thought to have hailed from the Caribbean, and the colliery\u2019s union banner showed a black miner alongside two white colleagues above the words \u201cBrothers beneath the surface\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5cd41ad9fc4326cbaafa68f85620c734c6b242ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cd41ad9fc4326cbaafa68f85620c734c6b242ab/542_0_2611_3264/800.jpg\" alt=\"Historian Norma Gregory, project lead.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Historian Norma Gregory, project lead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The harmony depicted on the banner, however, did not represent race relations in Nottinghamshire. On 23 August 1958, the city saw a 1,000-person-strong race riot, a precursor to the violence that erupted in London\u2019s Notting Hill a week later. Eight people were hospitalised and the Nottingham Evening Post wrote that Nottingham had become like \u201ca slaughterhouse\u201d.</p> <p>Cole says his introduction to the city in the early 60s wasn\u2019t particularly pleasant. \u201cThere were teddy boys with bicycle chains,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom six o\u2019clock you couldn\u2019t go out, because they would kick you left, right and centre.\u201d While racial tension was simmering over on the streets, it does not feature much in the accounts from below ground. When a colleague used a racial slur against Cole, the colliery manager told the offender to apologise immediately and threatened to sack him. The men report that opportunities for promotion were limited because of their skin colour, and Mitchell says black miners generally brushed off racist comments by colleagues: \u201cThere was no use having friction, because it would give a bad atmosphere and [that was] the last thing you wanted.\u201d</p> <p>When the National Union of Mineworkers went on strike in 1972 and 1974, black miners in Nottingham joined their colleagues on the picket line. However, along with 73% of their fellow Nottinghamshire miners, most did not strike during the 1984-85 strike.</p> <p>\u201cI stood side by side with the miners who were on strike,\u201d says Mitchell, who did strike in the 80s. \u201cYou had to stand with your colleagues, you couldn\u2019t let them down.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor recalls being asked to stand at the front of the picket line during a strike in the 70s. \u201cIf the policemen had seen me at the front, [a black man], you can just imagine how they would have hit me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d been in this country too long not to know what was going off.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9dd98d41938f5747cb7763f6b1bef896b30f1b12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dd98d41938f5747cb7763f6b1bef896b30f1b12/0_0_2118_2647/800.jpg\" alt=\"Garrey Mitchell, who worked at Gedling Colliery from 1974-1985.

This results in an annual turnover of around \u00a3204m, flagships in New York London and Tokyo, and the huge Dover Street Market store in Haymarket in London, which sells all of the Comme des Gar\u00e7ons lines plus brands ranging from C\u00e9line to Palace. Kawakubo is also shrewd: working with alum Junya Watanabe to set up his own line, and helping fashion\u2019s current bright young thing, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/oct/12/russian-fashion-gosha-rubchinskiy-post-soviet-designer-menswear\">Gosha Rubchinskiy</a>, by operating his business. With Comme des Gar\u00e7ons backing, Rubchinskiy\u2019s label has grown 350% over the past year. Arguably, Kawakubo\u2019s success is cold, hard proof that creativity and commercialism can co-exist in fashion. This exhibition pays tribute to that achievement.</p>",

  "<p>First rule of showbiz? People love it when things go wrong. Never has a lift been so botched \u2013 or, as Bruno pointed out, so dangerous. Ed Balls\u2019 scrappy man-handling of poor, brave Katya Jones is what this weekend will be remembered for. Yes, he could do the lift, as he demonstrated afterwards. But he couldn\u2019t do it when it counted. Still, this is the kind of authenticity people vote for. And Balls\u2019, er, ballsiness could keep him in business for some time. Maybe even into the final.</p> <p>Someone had to pay the price, though, and this week it was the charming and inspirational 71-year-old Lesley Joseph. She\u2019s done herself proud, and I hope she sees it. She\u2019s a great dancer and a fabulous performer but ultimately this is going to come down to a fight between virtuosity (Danny, Ore, Claudia and Louise if she can up her game) and novelty (Ed Balls, Judge Rinder with his faces, possibly Greg with his superhero lifts). With Laura out this week with a sprained ankle, it was always going to be Daisy, Anastacia or Greg in the dance-off. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0304cdf055b6dbeaff5a02750ceec37b105c0170\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0304cdf055b6dbeaff5a02750ceec37b105c0170/0_125_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charming and inspirational \u2026 Lesley Joseph has done herself proud, and I hope she sees it.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charming and inspirational \u2026 Lesley Joseph has done herself proud, and I hope she sees it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Guy Levy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, Lesley\u2019s ousting was a surprise \u2013 and a major disappointment for Anton, who has seemed like a different person this series, the best he\u2019s ever been. \u201cYou pushed me to be creative,\u201d he said as they prepared to leave and it really felt like he meant it. I wonder if this will be his last series. It\u2019s a shame they weren\u2019t around for longer. </p> <p>Highlights? Len pogo-ing to House of Pain\u2019s Jump Around. Natalie\u2019s face when she and Greg did not have to face the dance-off. Dave Arch conducting We Found Love in a Hopeless Place. Lowlights? The posing and pointing of the judges during the Goodman\u2019s Department Store routine. (Make \u2018em dance!) Greg\u2019s robotic cha-cha. The growing numbers in the Strictly Convalescence Home: first Will Young (\u201cpersonal reasons\u201d), now Brendan (lung infection) and Laura (sprained ankle). Who will succumb next to the curse? At this rate, Balls is almost guaranteed a buy-through to the final because the rest of them are dropping like flies ...<br></p> <h2>Darcey: woman of a thousand hairstyles</h2> <p>Darcey is in a lovely mood this series and seems relaxed and happy to state what she really thinks. I\u2019m almost missing her previous stilted and unsure self, when she used to go up at the end of every sentence and say \u201cYah?\u201d She inadvertently caused one of this season\u2019s top moments when she meant to say \u201cCome back next week\u201d to Ed Balls and said \u201cCome back next year\u201d. To which Bruno replied, \u201cI\u2019m gone.\u201d</p> <h2>Bruno: the jack-in-the-box</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb7d29f32304825620d24d6a8689f478fab0ddbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb7d29f32304825620d24d6a8689f478fab0ddbc/0_174_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"I want what he\u2019s on \u2026 Judge Rinder.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">I want what he\u2019s on \u2026 Judge Rinder.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Guy Levy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A classic Bruno-ism: \u201cI would like to see it again, don\u2019t you?\u201d (To Danny Mac\u2019s rumba.) His French speaking was also hilarious, particularly when he felt the need to translate it. His reaction to Balls is consistently pleasing: \u201cYou always take us to places we never expect.\u201d Likewise to Judge Rinder: \u201cIt was something to behold.\u201d Rinder took this as a positive, of course. (He takes everything as a positive. I want what he\u2019s on.) No, Judge \u2026 he meant it as an insult!<br></p> <h2>Len: the diamond geezer on a farewell tour</h2> <p>Len\u2019s gone demob-happy now we\u2019re nearing the halfway point, ribbing Anton (\u201cPull it together!\u201d) and AJ (\u201cYour samba walks were slow and oily\u201d), praising Greg for his \u201cCuban breaks here, there and everywhere\u201d and landing the champion one-liner of the series to Balls: \u201cThat\u2019s the trouble with hitch-hiking. You always get a dodgy lift.\u201d His demonstration of the toe-heel swivel and the story of the broken banister on Len\u2019s Lens were vintage Len. How on earth will they replace him?<br></p> <h2>Craig: the great choreographer trapped inside a pantomime dame</h2> <p>Craig has gone into simmer mode. He was eerily kind this week (on a couple of occasions, he marked higher than Darcey.) His verdict on Ore seemed over-generous, but there is something about Ore that he loves. He\u2019s not a fan of Louise: \u201cAt least you got a free trip to Paris out of it.\u201d She is going to fall into the judges\u2019 drop zone if she doesn\u2019t up her game next week. <br></p> <h2>This week\u2019s verdict</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b69981c4210ba4c88ddee0b3254bcfc7d161db1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b69981c4210ba4c88ddee0b3254bcfc7d161db1d/0_259_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daisy paid the price for not being in a sexy costume.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daisy paid the price for not being in a sexy costume.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Guy Levy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Daisy paid the price for not being in a sexy costume. Hopefully she\u2019ll bounce back next week. Greg needs to pull something dramatic out of the bag. Anastacia is having a miraculous resurgence. (Get well soon, Brendan.)
