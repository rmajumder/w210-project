  "<p>It\u2019s been a particularly horrifying year for minority groups in America. The increasingly documented inhumanity towards African American men by police and the brutal act of homophobia that took mostly Hispanic lives at a gay club in Orlando have awakened many to the bleak knowledge that progress is stalling and instead, regressive views on race and sexuality are still dangerously pervasive. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/15/its-impossible-to-be-vulnerable-how-moonlight-reflects-being-a-black-gay-man-in-the-us\">\u2018It\u2019s impossible to be vulnerable\u2019: how Moonlight reflects being a black gay man in the US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stories of LGBT people of colour have been largely ignored in film or at least relegated to the sidelines while instead, we\u2019re offered up the whitewashed history of Roland Emmerich\u2019s tone deaf Stonewall or straight-friendly Oscarbait like The Danish Girl. But, in a festival season that\u2019s too often populated by quite literally vanilla awards fare, writer/director Barry Jenkins\u2019 astonishing new film is both proudly black and refreshingly queer. It\u2019s a thrilling, deeply necessary work that opens up a much-needed and rarely approached on-screen conversation about the nature of gay masculinity.</p> <p>Based on the play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue by Tarell Alvin McCraney, the film follows the life of a man in three key stages. Initially, we meet nine-year-old Chiron as he runs through the streets of Miami, chased by his peers. He attracts the attention of local drug dealer Jean (Mahershala Ali) who comes to his aid and with the help of his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Monae), he gets him to open up as they take care of him at their home. It becomes a refuge for him, away from his mother Paula (Naomie Harris, giving her best performance since 28 Days Later), a nurse with a crack addiction, who alternates between overbearing affection and cruel neglect.</p> <p>Chiron is withdrawn and lonely, a target for the boys at school who seem to recognise something within him that\u2019s still a secret to Chiron himself. In one, unforgettably wrenching scene, he asks Jean and Teresa what a faggot is and how he knows if he might be one. By the time we see Chiron in the second chapter, he\u2019s a teenager who\u2019s learned to survive by hiding his sexuality from those around him, slowly developing a tough exterior. But his true identity still haunts him, he cries so much he worries he might \u201cturn into drops\u201d and he remains a bullied and physically abused outcast. In the final stretch, Chiron is a man with a fully developed guard against the world, a toxic masculinity that\u2019s led him down dark and dangerous alleys to avoid facing who he really is.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NJj12tJzqc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9NJj12tJzqc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Despite the difficult subject matter at hand, Jenkins avoids drowning us in despair. There\u2019s a remarkably unexpected focus on the beauty that surrounds Chiron with moments of soaring wonder so perfectly aligned that there\u2019s something almost Malickian about his marriage of lush music and dreamy imagery. It\u2019s an entirely unique vision and wrongfoots us from the start. Similarly, the script avoids cliche and refuses to paint these characters as the stereotypes they\u2019re so often presented as. Chiron\u2019s surrogate father of sorts, played with exceptional deftness by Ali, confounds our worst Hollywoodised expectations. Rather than training Chiron to run drugs for him or grooming him in a predatory manner, he\u2019s giving swimming lessons and telling him that his sexuality is nothing to be ashamed of. It\u2019s yet more levity that helps the film from becoming unrelentingly grim.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/04/ghostbusters-star-trek-beyond-gay-characters\">From Ghostbusters to Star Trek Beyond: Gay characters are there, but only just</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Jenkins doesn\u2019t pull any punches in showing the crushing loneliness and horrific violence of being a gay man in a culture where homosexuality is seen as a weakness. We see the visible and invisible scars that develop from a lack of acceptance and by the time we finally meet adult Chiron, played with incredible nuance by ex-athlete Trevante Rhodes, he\u2019s trapped by his own desire, regulating his behaviour to remove anything that could be seen as \u201cgay\u201d. The third act sees him return home to reunite with a school friend (an exceptional performance from Andre Holland) with whom he had his one sexual encounter with during his teenage years. There\u2019s a thrilling, heart-pumping chemistry in these scenes as we see Chiron\u2019s performed toughness fade in the face of a love he\u2019s so sorely needed throughout his tortured life. It\u2019s beautifully choreographed and easily the most believably intimate gay pairing since Andrew Haigh\u2019s Weekend. Every single aching glance is a poignant reminder of what Chiron has endured to get here.</p> <p>Moonlight is a profoundly moving film about growing up as a gay man in disguise, a difficult and damaging journey that\u2019s realised with staggering care and delicacy and one that will resonate with anyone who has had to do the same. We\u2019re starved of these narratives and Jenkins\u2019 electrifying drama showcases why they are so hugely important, providing an audience with a rarely seen portrait of what it really means to be a black gay man in America today. It\u2019s a stunning achievement.</p>",
  "<p>A few years ago, the organisers of the Tour of Britain began subtly tailoring their event to position it as a key buildup race to the world road race championships and this year the philosophy appears to have paid off in spades, with Mark Cavendish and Andr\u00e9 Greipel among a group of top sprinters lining up on Sunday in Glasgow for the eight-day trek to London.</p> <p>The world elite championship in Qatar is pancake flat and is later than usual \u2013 16 October \u2013 in the hope that this will provide cooler weather for racing so Britain is just the first step for Cavendish after his success in Rio, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/mark-cavendish-silver-rio-olympics-cycling-omnium\">where he won the silver medal in the omnium</a>.

Their trade teams \u2013 Fortuneo and Tinkoff respectively \u2013 are not down to race so space has been found for them in the national squad. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/02/owain-doull-tour-of-britain-bradley-wiggins\">Owain Doull of Team Wiggins is another man with his eye on Qatar</a>, so, too, Ben Swift of Team Sky.</p> <p>There are only two stages out of the nine where a mass finish looks guaranteed because this is one of the hilliest routes devised since the British Tour was relaunched in 2004. The sprint stages bookend the race, with a relatively benign opener south from Glasgow to Castle Douglas and a repeat of last year\u2019s three-pronged circuit race in central London, where Viviani was awarded victory last year after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/13/edvald-boasson-hagen-seals-win-while-bradley-wiggins-may-ride-after-rio\">a dramatic finish-line clash with Greipel</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/01/team-gbs-cycling-heroes-call-for-legacy-of-everyday-cycling\">Team GB's cycling heroes call for 'legacy of everyday cycling'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Monday\u2019s stage through the Lake District includes the climbs of Whinlatter and the Struggle before an uphill finish in Kendal \u2013 one for Swift or Viviani perhaps \u2013 while Tuesday has the Cat &amp; Fiddle pass in the Peak District and Wednesday features 4,000m of climbing through Powys en route to Builth Wells. Thursday\u2019s roads into Bath look more propitious, if far from flat, while Friday features what should be a decisive uphill finish on Dartmoor, on the Haytor climb where Simon Yates, a winner in the current Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, triumphed when still an amateur in 2013.</p> <p>The Haytor finish is followed the next morning by a 15km time trial in Bristol, where the same course on Clifton Down is used for a 90km circuit race, an innovative format that should draw a massive crowd, but where a climb from the Avon at 2km to go could eliminate the heavier fastmen.</p> <p>The blend of time trialling and climbing means the overall title is hard to predict.

The Haytor finish will suit Daniel Martin of Etixx-Quick-Step, but the time trial stage will favour specialists such as Tom Dumoulin of the Netherlands, the Australian Rohan Dennis or the national champion, Alex Dowsett. Of the trio Dumoulin \u2013 winner of the mountain stage at Andorra-Arcalis in this year\u2019s Tour \u2013 looks best able to cope with the climbs.</p> <p>One time trial specialist who is unlikely to target the overall title is Sir Bradley Wiggins, set to make yet another farewell appearance in the British Tour 12 months after last year\u2019s goodbye tour.

An NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll last month, in contrast, rated his support at a positively vertiginous 8%.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s handlers have drafted proposed answers for him to give to Jackson, including, according to a version <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/us/politics/donald-trump-black-voters-wayne-jackson.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0\">leaked to the New York Times</a>, un-Trumpian utterances such as: \u201cI want to make race disappear as a factor in government and governance.\u201d If asked whether his campaign is racist, he is advised to avoid repeating the word and to talk about his plan to wean people from welfare to work. \u201cThe proof, as they say, will be in the pudding. Coming into a community is meaningless unless we offer an alternative to the horrible progressive agenda that has perpetuated a permanent underclass in America.\u201d</p> <p>A Clinton/Kaine campaign sign hangs in the window of his barber shop on Detroit\u2019s west side, but Vonzie Whitlow doesn\u2019t mind Trump\u2019s visit. \u201cWhy not? I think it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d The Republican\u2019s rhetoric about the black community has an air of truth, Whitlow said. He reeled off recent presidents. \u201cWhat\u2019d they do for us? Ain\u2019t too many [presidents] come into the black communities since I\u2019ve been here, so I think it\u2019s a good job for him to come out here, talk to the black people. Ain\u2019t nothing wrong with it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve not heard a single thing from Trump that I agree with</p> <footer> <cite>James Fugate</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even if Trump avoids unleashing toxic fumes in Motor City, however, he will remain radioactive to the likes of James Fugate, 61, who runs LA\u2019s Eso Won Books, one of the US\u2019s few remaining African American bookstores. \u201cI\u2019ve not heard a single thing from Trump that I agree with. I think he\u2019s a cynical person who is appealing to the most racist instincts of a lot of white people, to a legacy of fear about blacks.\u201d</p> <p>The real estate mogul and his father were sued in the 1970s for anti-black bias in rental properties. In 1989, Trump took out full-page ads in four New York newspapers <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/central-park-five-donald-trump-jogger-rape-case-new-york\">demanding the execution of the Central Park five</a>, a group of teenagers charged with a particularly heinous rape. When their conviction was overturned \u2013 DNA identified the real rapist \u2013 he doubled down, branding the apology and payout to them the \u201cheist of the century\u201d.</p> <p>Trump hounded Obama over his birth certificate, emboldening the rightwing fringe that thinks the president is a foreign Muslim. He was slow to disavow an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/28/donald-trump-former-kkk-leader-david-duke\">endorsement from former KKK leader David Duke</a>.

It ignores the existence of a large African American middle class; that in the past eight years, black poverty and unemployment have improved; and that Obama\u2019s health law has extended healthcare to the needy. But <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2015/jan/05/rising-income-inequality-deadlier-for-black-americans-study\">black incomes have stagnated</a> and the wealth and employment gap between black people and white people has widened. Fatal police shootings have underscored racial inequality in the criminal justice system. With just a few months left to Obama\u2019s presidency, hope and change feel like a faint, distant echo.</p> <p>\u201cI love Barack, but I\u2019m still struggling,\u201d said Greyman, the Harlem single mother. She was on her way to a city jobs programme, as her current job will soon end. She travels an hour each day to take a daughter to a charter school for a better education. They still live with Greyman\u2019s parents because she can\u2019t afford decent housing. She is no great fan of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>, but will vote for her come November. \u201cAt least my kids would have a better shot with Hillary in office.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I love Barack but I\u2019m still struggling</p> <footer> <cite>Vanessa Greyman, a single mother in Harlem</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bethel, the barber, is backing Jill Stein, the Green party candidate, because he associates Clinton with her husband\u2019s incarceration policies in the 1990s. \u201cThe three strikes law is a pipeline to the prison industry, and these are the ramifications now in the neighborhood.\u201d</p> <p>Others, such as Umi, the cigar show owner, hope an election that has become a referendum on Trump will lead to an awakening. \u201cI hope it sparks something in us as a race to understand that we don\u2019t have no voice out here. Who waiting for leaders out here but us? Who waiting for somebody to say some shit to help us get ahead? We gotta get ourselves ahead.\u201d</p> <p>Fugate, a soft-spoken, bespectacled figure who hosted the LA launch of Obama\u2019s memoir Dreams From My Father in 1995, gives more credit to progressive achievements \u2013 achievements that would be imperilled under Trump. \u201cWhat have we got to lose? Voting rights.\u201d</p> <p>The Republican-led effort to curb voting rights in North Carolina and elsewhere, said the bookstore owner, was the most offensive thing he had seen in 40 years. Trump-appointed judges would roll back recent victories on this front, he warned. \u201cHe\u2019s already named 10 wackos\u201d as potential supreme court nominees. ( Trump has named 11 potential justices, all white.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c21af9da174c5c046faac886b81bf71465328ae3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c21af9da174c5c046faac886b81bf71465328ae3/0_48_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"James Fugate, owner of the LA book store Eso Won.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Fugate, owner of the LA book store Eso Won.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rory Carroll/THE GUARDIAN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another thing to lose, Fugate said, was police oversight, such as federal investigators uncovering the Ferguson police tactic of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/04/ferguson-police-racial-persecution-federal-report\">fining poor residents</a> to feed city coffers. \u201cThey found out all the little tricks. But Trump? He\u2019d be pro-police. He just doesn\u2019t understand the world.\u201d</p> <p>Others cited Obamacare as an example of what could be lost. It all added up, in truth, to a rather short list of progressive accomplishments. But it was enough to decide that if the jester took the throne, there was plenty to lose.</p> <p>Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease has robbed Leroy Peete, a 72-year-old Detroit native and Vietnam veteran, of speech.
