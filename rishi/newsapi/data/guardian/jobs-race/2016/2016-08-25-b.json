  "<p>A prominent campaigner for increased consumer rights for punters has offered a cautious welcome to a new player in the crowded internet gambling market: a bookmaking site that claims it will not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jul/12/mark-johnston-itv-horse-racing-ditches-betting-news\" title=\"\">ban or restrict its customers for winning</a>, and will guarantee to lay any price to lose at least \u00a3500.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s positive that an online bookmaker is trying to trade in a traditional way,\u201d Brian Chappell, the founder of the website justiceforpunters.org, said on Thursday. \u201cThis type of approach, if it continues, will certainly be welcomed by most punters, especially the thousands who have their bets restricted to pennies by the major players.\u201d</p> <p>Shareholders in Black Type Bet, which launched on Wednesday, include Mylo Sangster, the grandson of the famous owner-breeder Robert, whose blue and green silks were among the most famous of the last 50 years. The new firm is seeking a niche in a highly-competitive market which has seen a number of bookies come and go in recent years, on occasions taking their customers\u2019 deposits with them, but Black Type is staking its claim to be different on a willingness to lay bets at advertised prices.</p> <p>A bookie that accepts your money might not sound revolutionary but in recent years increasing numbers of online gamblers have suffered the frustration of attempting to place bets on racing and sport with major firms, only to find their stakes restricted to tiny amounts, or refused altogether.</p> <p>The Horserace Bettors Forum, a group launched by the British Horseracing Authority to represent the interests of racing punters, also recently claimed at least 20,000 accounts were closed by bookmakers in the first six months of 2016. This, according to Simon Rowlands, the HBF\u2019s chairman, raised fears that \u201cthe appeal of betting on horse racing is possibly being seriously eroded by the trading practices of individual bookmakers.\u201d</p> <p>Black Type is adamant that it will not close winning accounts, with the sole caveat that customers using computer programmes to \u201carb\u201d bets via betting exchanges \u2013 that is, take a price on their site and lay it on an exchange for a small, guaranteed profit \u2013 will be barred on a \u201cthree-strikes-and-out\u201d basis. There are no gaming products \u2013 such as virtual slot machines and roulette \u2013 on the site, and Stephen Davison, a spokesman for the company, said its promise to lay its prices to lose at least \u00a3500 is cast iron.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s there on the site in big letters and there\u2019s no hiding away from it,\u201d Davison said. \u201cThis is not a project that\u2019s been built up overnight.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re after day-to-day \u00a320 each-ways, \u00a350 to win and \u00a31 Lucky 15s, and there are plenty of punters like that out there who are disillusioned because they\u2019ve won a bit somewhere and been closed, or they\u2019ve backed something at 12-1 that\u2019s gone off at 6-1 and the bookie has decided they don\u2019t want their business.\u201d</p> <p>To maintain its margins, Black Type will not offer the \u201cBest Odds Guaranteed\u201d concession on racing that is widespread among major firms, or offer inflated odds or free bets to new customers. It is, in a sense, an attempt to return to traditional bookmaking practices in the internet age, and only time will tell how successful that can be.</p> <p>Chappell, a fierce and persistent critic of bookmakers on the issue of restrictions and account closures, is one of many who will watch with interest. He also points out that the Australian state of New South Wales introduced legislation in January 2015 which forces bookies to honour guarantees on the minimum bets they will lay, and that a number of firms have seen their turnover and profitability rise as a result.</p> <p>He would like to see the Gambling Commission, which regulates the industry in Britain, introduce equivalent rules for bookies trading in the United Kingdom. \u201cAt the moment, bookmakers are advertising prices but they are discriminating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a few people, as they claim. It\u2019s thousands and thousands of people.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump has embarked on a cross-country tour to proclaim \u2013 to mostly white audiences \u2013 that he alone can solve what ails the black community. </p> <p>\u201cSo many in the African-American community are doing so badly, poverty and crime way up, employment and jobs way down: I will fix it, promise,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/768791265811062788\">tweeted</a> Thursday morning. And the day before, in Mississippi, Trump <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-hillary-clinton-bigot-n637476\">called</a> Hillary Clinton a \u201cbigot\u201d because she supposedly only cares about African Americans for their votes, and he told them to \u201creject\u201d her \u201cbigotry\u201d and vote for him instead. </p> <p>What he continuously fails to recognize is that he is the bigot \u2013 and the problem that the black community intends to solve by not voting for him.</p> <p>Trump has shown no desire to reach out to African Americans during this election until it became abundantly clear that he needs their votes to win the presidency. Before now, he has spent months rebuffing invitations to speak at black events while <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/03/01/donald-trump-and-david-duke-for-the-record/\">hesitating to disavow</a> the likes of former Klan Grand Wizard David Duke. </p> <p>All his sad, pathetic and misguided attempts at black voter outreach have occurred after he <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-gets-0-support-black-voters-ohio-pennsylvania-nbc-n609026\">polled at 0%</a> among black voters in both Ohio and Pennsylvania \u2014 two states he must win to assure victory.<br></p> <p>The other day in Dimondale, Michigan, a city 90 miles from Detroit that is 93% white, he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/20/its-hard-to-imagine-a-much-worse-pitch-donald-trump-could-have-made-for-the-black-vote/\">said</a>, \u201cTo those [African American voters] I say the following: what do you have to lose by trying something new like Trump? What do you have to lose? You live in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?\u201d</p> <p>A lot. A vote for him isn\u2019t so much a vote for something \u201cnew\u201d as a return to a more bigoted and regressive past, an allegedly idyllic America that wrapped white Americans in a comforting blanket of privilege and left black Americans out in the cold. He never acknowledges that America has created structures that are intended to impede black advancement, and he\u2019d probably scoff at the <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/the-average-black-family-would-need-228-years-to-build-the-wealth-of-a-white-family-today\">data</a> supporting the seismic gap in black and white wealth inequality.</p> <p>Trump rarely visits black communities, and his company has a history of legal action taken over allegations of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-governments-racial-bias-case-against-donald-trumps-company-and-how-he-fought-it/2016/01/23/fb90163e-bfbe-11e5-bcda-62a36b394160_story.html\">not renting</a> to African Americans. Trump\u2019s political and professional business empires both perpetuate America\u2019s racial inequalities.</p> <p>And we cannot overlook how his rise to political prominence began by attempting to legitimize the discredited birther movement. Trump has spent seven years attempting to undermine the intellect and accomplishments of America\u2019s first black president. I believe his underlying political philosophy stems from the premise that a successful black American is either not truly successful or is not actually American and has taken a job that \u201crightfully\u201d belongs to a white person. </p> <p>Trump has made all of these claims from a pedestal built upon a business model based around <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/us/politics/donald-trump-debt.html?_r=0\">concealing</a> large sums of debt, underpaying contractors and underplaying his inherited wealth \u2013 while presenting his brand as pristine luxury, the result of honest hard work and American ingenuity.</p> <p>Black America does not need the dishonest, obtuse and false promises and generosity that Trump espouses. Instead we need to deconstruct his ignorant, oppressive argument and reveal it for what it really is: in the apt words of another journalist, nothing but a \u201c<a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/291747-former-breitbart-editor-calls-trump-a-turd-tornado\">turd tornado</a>\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>The British Horseracing Authority is urgently investigating how a race at Musselburgh on Thursday afternoon was widely advertised as being staged over 10 furlongs when it was run over nine.</p> <p>Horses were entered and declared for the HBJ Gately Handicap, worth \u00a32,588 to the winner, on the basis it was a 10-furlong race. The racecard at Musselburgh also listed its distance as 10 furlongs, along with the Racing Post and most national newspapers, and the fact it was officially scheduled to be contested over a furlong less became apparent only late on Thursday morning.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/mar/16/cheltenham-festival-day-two-live\">Cheltenham Festival: Sprinter Sacre wins Champion Chase \u2013 as it happened | Barry Glendenning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moments before the off, as betting on the race reached its peak, the Racing Post\u2019s website still listed the contest as being over 10 furlongs, although other internet sites had corrected the distance to nine. Despite the confusion, the race was not declared void for betting purposes, with Exclusive Diamond, the winner, returned as the 5-6 favourite.</p> <p>Robin Mounsey, the BHA\u2019s media manager, said the error was \u201cdeeply regrettable\u201d and the authority is working with Weatherbys, which handles the sport\u2019s administration, to find the cause.</p> <p>\u201cThe implications for horsemen and the betting public are obvious and we would like to apologise to all affected,\u201d Mounsey said. \u201cAs soon as the issue was identified, a correction was distributed by Weatherbys, and all trainers were called to inform them of the error and to inform them they were able to withdraw theirhorses and have entry fees refunded should they not wish to run over the revised distance. No trainers took up this option.</p> <p>\u201cThe BHA and Weatherbys are working together as a priority to understand what caused the issue. This is a serious matter and once the cause has been determined we will take whatever action is appropriate, including taking all steps to try to ensure that this does not happen again.\u201d</p> <p>On a busy day for the regulator, Any Currency became the first horse since 1980 to be disqualified from a race at the Cheltenham Festival owing to a failed post-race dope test when the BHA\u2019s disciplinary panel confirmed Martin Keighley\u2019s chaser had been stripped of his win in the Glenfarclas Cross Country Chase in March.</p> <p>Any Currency tested positive for triamcinolone acetonide (TCA), a painkiller used to treat horses in training but not allowed to be present in a horse\u2019s system on a race day. The normal withdrawal time after use of the drug is 14 days but the disciplinary panel accepted Keighley\u2019s evidence to the hearing that Any Currency had been administered with TCA 41 days before his race at Cheltenham, describing its continued presence in the horse\u2019s system as \u201cexceptional\u201d. As a result the panel did not impose a fine.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m delighted the panel has vindicated my actions by deciding not to impose a fine against me,\u201d the trainer said in a statement released through his solicitor. \u201cNaturally still to be punished by losing the race in these circumstances is difficult to take but we must now look forward to the next Festival and Any Currency\u2019s next run where I and my team will be all the more determined to win.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Boothright, who runs the syndicate which owns Any Currency, suggested the BHA had \u201cbottled it\u201d in remarks reported in the Racing Post. \u201cThe ruling is he has been disqualified, he will lose all the prize money but that Martin has done nothing wrong, so the BHA have bottled it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete shambles.\u201d</p> <p>Mounsey stressed the Authority\u2019s \u201cstrict liability\u201d rules on positive tests left the panel with little alternative but to disqualify Any Currency from first place. \u201cThere is no discretion,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rule is one of strict liability and once a horse has tested positive, the automatic consequence is that it is disqualified, irrespective of whether any penalty is imposed. Our rules are in line with the European racing community, and the majority of the international racing community.\u201d</p> <p>Josies Orders, the runner-up in March, was promoted to first place. Any Currency is the first horse to be disqualified from first place for a failed dope test at the Festival since Tied Cottage, who was first across the line in the Gold Cup in 1980.</p>",
  "<p>A media company controlled by American tycoon John Malone is leading the battle to buy Formula One with the broadcaster Sky also in the hunt.</p> <p>Malone\u2019s Liberty Media, which owns a collection of media, telecoms and entertainment assets, is in talks with the private equity group CVC about a deal for the Formula One parent company, Delta Topco.</p> <p>Other companies who have looked at a deal to buy the motorsport include the Qatari owners of football club Paris Saint-Germain. Liberty Media\u2019s sister company Liberty Global, which owns telecom groups around the world, including Virgin Media, and is working on a deal with Discovery Communications, another Malone company, has also taken a look at Formula One. Apple has also been linked.</p> <p>It will cost around $8.5bn (\u00a36.4bn) to take control of Formula One.

The private equity fund bought a majority stake in Formula One in 2006 for around $1.7bn but has since reduced that to 35.5% by selling minority stakes to investors such as BlackRock and the Norwegian sovereign fund.</p> <p>The ownership structure of Delta Topco is complex. While CVC holds 35% of the shares, it controls the sport because its shares have special voting rights. Waddell &amp; Reed, an American fund manager, has a stake of just under 20% while Bernie Ecclestone, who is the chief executive of Formula One Group, also has a stake.</p> <p>Formula One Group holds the commercial rights to the sport, making its money from sponsorship deals, television rights, and charging fees to the venues that host the races.</p> <p>Despite CVC making billions from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone\">Formula One</a>, the sport is under pressure to become more entertaining due to the dominance of Mercedes, whose drivers are<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton\"> Lewis Hamilton</a> and Nico Rosberg. </p> <p>The motor-racing tracks in Europe, including Silverstone in the UK, are struggling to make a profit from hosting grand prix events once the fee to Formula One Group is taken into account.
