  "<p>A BBC presenter has launched a scathing attack on the broadcaster\u2019s diversity strategy, claiming he was sacked for being a white man.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jon-holmes\">Jon Holmes</a>, a writer and comedian who has appeared on Radio 4\u2019s The Now Show for 18 years, said he was told he was being fired from the programme because it was being recast with \u201cmore women and diversity\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/19/lenny-henry-ringfenced-funding-tv-diversity-tony-hall-channel-4\">Lenny Henry repeats call for ringfenced funding to boost TV diversity</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3817609/BBC-sacked-white-man-Radio-4-comic-told-need-women-minorities.html\">Writing in the Mail on Sunday,</a> the award-winning broadcaster \u2013 who has presented shows on four other BBC radio stations and XFM, claimed he was in favour of properly representing Britain\u2019s multicultural society, but that things had gone too far. </p> <p>\u201cShould I, as a white man (through no fault of my own), be fired from my job because I am a white man?\u201d he asks. \u201cArguably, yes. You may well think I\u2019m crap on The Now Show, and that\u2019s fine, but to be told it\u2019s because I\u2019m the wrong sex and colour? I\u2019m just not sure that\u2019s helpful to anyone\u2019s cause.\u201d</p> <p>Holmes, who has also worked in television, said his initial tweet about the issue on Monday had prompted other presenters, actors and agents to talk about similar experiences. He recounts the story of one agent who was told his client was \u201cperfect for the role\u201d but that they had been told \u201cto cast someone Asian\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jonholmes1/status/780313745788694528\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sad to announce I&#39;ve been axed from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNowShow\">@BBCNowShow</a> as &#39;we want to recast with more women and diversity&#39; Tsk.

We\u2019d like to thank Jon Holmes for his contribution but our comedy shows are constantly evolving and it was simply time to create opportunities for new regulars when The Now Show returns this autumn.</p> <p>\u201cJon\u2019s contract was lapsed and wasn\u2019t renewed and this was a creative not a diversity decision.\u201d</p>"
