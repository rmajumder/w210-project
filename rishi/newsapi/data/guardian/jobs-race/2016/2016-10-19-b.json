  "<p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended Facebook board member Peter Thiel\u2019s support of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in a post that invoked the importance of \u201cdiversity\u201d for the social media company. </p> <p>\u201cWe care deeply about diversity. That\u2019s easy to say when it means standing up for ideas you agree with. It\u2019s a lot harder when it means standing up for the rights of people with different viewpoints to say what they care about,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in a post visible only to Facebook employees, a <a href=\"https://s13.postimg.org/ohe1sci6f/mmexport1476831885441.jpg\">photograph</a> of which was shared on Hacker News on Tuesday. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/21/peter-thiel-republican-convention-speech\">Donald Trump, Peter Thiel and the death of democracy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t create a culture that says it cares about diversity and then excludes almost half the country because they back a political candidate,\u201d Zuckerberg continued. \u201cThere are many reasons a person might support Trump that do not involve racism, sexism, xenophobia or accepting sexual assault.\u201d </p> <p>Facebook confirmed the authenticity of the post, but has not responded to repeated requests for comment on Thiel from the Guardian.</p> <p>One of the co-founders of PayPal, Thiel was an early Facebook investor who maintains deep connections and influence in Silicon Valley. His positions at Facebook and other companies have come under increased scrutiny since the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/technology/peter-thiel-donald-j-trump.html?_r=0\">New York Times reported</a> this weekend that he planned to donate $1.25m to Trump\u2019s campaign. </p> <p>Thiel had previously served as a delegate for Trump and delivered a keynote address at the Republican national convention. He also wrote an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/peter-thiel-trump-has-taught-us-this-years-most-important-political-lesson/2016/09/06/84df8182-738c-11e6-8149-b8d05321db62_story.html?utm_term=.055331c5c30f\">op-ed for the Washington Post</a> in which he praised the Trump campaign\u2019s success at \u201csaying things that made sense to voters\u201d. </p> <p>But news of Thiel\u2019s donation to Trump\u2019s campaign, which came after numerous women made allegations of sexual assault against Trump, let loose a new wave of criticism of Thiel within the tech industry.</p> <p>Project Include, an organization that seeks to promote diversity and inclusion in the tech industry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/17/project-include-y-combinator-donald-trump-peter-thiel\">cut ties with Y Combinator</a> on Monday, citing the influential startup incubator\u2019s failure to remove Thiel as a \u201cpart-time partner\u201d. </p> <p>Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, has <a href=\"http://blog.samaltman.com/trump\">compared Trump to Adolf Hitler</a>, but he too invoked \u201cdiversity\u201d in <a href=\"http://blog.samaltman.com/the-2016-election\">defending his decision</a> not to disassociate from Thiel. </p> <p>Thiel is one of eight members of Facebook\u2019s board of directors. All of the directors are white and six of them are men. </p> <p>According to its July 2016 \u201c<a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/07/facebook-diversity-update-positive-hiring-trends-show-progress/\">diversity update</a>\u201d, Facebook\u2019s staff is 52% white and 67% male. The company\u2019s workforce is just 2% black, 4% Latino and 33% female. </p> <p>In 1998, Thiel co-authored the book The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and Political Intolerance on Campus, which criticized Stanford University\u2019s valuing of campus diversity. According to the <a href=\"http://www.independent.org/store/book.asp?id=38#t-2\">publisher\u2019s synopsis</a>, the book also argued that \u201ccampus hysteria over date rape \u2013 a phenomenon that has been greatly exaggerated \u2013 [was] leading to more unjustified restrictions of student liberties\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/10/facebook-investor-marc-andreessen-apology-offensive-india-tweet-net-neutrality-free-basics\">criticized another board member</a>, Marc Andreessen, for his statement on Twitter that appeared to support colonial rule in India. Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10102645335962321\">wrote then</a> that Andreessen\u2019s views \u201cdo not represent the way Facebook or I think at all\u201d. </p>",

Japanese newspapers reported that Remy Gardner had been seen behind the wheel of the car just before the incident. He went on to compete in Sunday\u2019s Moto2 race, finishing 19th.</p> <p>Police in Tochigi prefecture, where Motegi is located, had confirmed they were holding an 18-year-old man but declined to name him or connect his arrest to the alleged road rage incident involving Wayne Gardner.

A statement released on Remy\u2019s official website on Wednesday said: \u201cDespite recent media speculation and rumour, Remy Gardner is currently en-route to Phillip Island where his intention is to ride in the upcoming Moto2 race in front of his home fans.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cIn response to the stories circulating in the press and on social media, he has not been charged with any offence relating to a road rage incident that occurred in Japan and looks forward to completing the season with Tasca Scuderia Racing.<br></p> <p>\u201cRemy has no comment in relation to the incident.\u201d</p> <p>The statement made no mention of Wayne Gardner\u2019s current situation.</p> <p>The Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, told the Nine Network earlier on Wednesday that consular support had been provided to the Gardners. </p> <p>Wayne Gardner, 57, became the first Australian to win motorcycling\u2019s 500cc world championship in 1987 and won the Suzuka Eight Hours endurance race four times during a successful 10-year career.</p>",
  "<p>Bonnie Greer tells me, with pride, that she doesn\u2019t really engage much with contemporary culture.

I am a proud face of the diversity and future of the great Australian Labor party.</p> <p>\u201cI look forward to the day when this country will recognise my rights as equal rights, when I too can marry in my country, on my country, as a recognised first Australian.\u201d</p> <p>The former Alice Springs town councillor said he wanted Territorians to be part of the changes needed, particularly for the living conditions and economic development of the NT\u2019s remote and Indigenous communities, so that \u201crace-based policies are a thing for the history books.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CPaech/status/788244965377703936\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Team Labor 1st day of sittings! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/proud?src=hash\">#proud</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/F2Pe8HOjdG\">pic.twitter.com/F2Pe8HOjdG</a></p>&mdash; Chansey Paech MLA (@CPaech) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CPaech/status/788244965377703936\">October 18, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>He would never allow or tolerate hate speech, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/22/northern-territory-minister-resigns-over-homophobic-remarks\">homophobia</a>, or discrimination in the parliament, he said.</p> <p>Across the aisle the opposition leader, Gary Higgins, offered a mea culpa for the past term of government. Higgins and his deputy, Lia Finocchiaro, were the only two CLP members to survive the electoral defeat of the party.</p> <p>He said the CLP government did some good work but \u201clet down Territorians in a way that was totally unacceptable\u201d.</p> <p>It was now up to him and Finocchiaro to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/27/its-a-thumping-labor-wins-northern-territory-election\">learn the lessons of the 2016 election</a> and to rebuild confidence in conservative politics, Higgins said, and he gave an \u201cunreserved apology\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhere there should have been consultation, there was belligerence. Where there should have been communication, there was spin. Where there should have been respect, there was defiance. Where there should have been loyalty there was disunity. For that I am sorry.\u201d</p> <p>Higgins\u2019s speech was followed by Sandra Nelson, who won the seat of Katherine for Labor for the first time ever, by 33 votes.</p> <p>In 1975, a then four-year-old Nelson and her family fled East Timor\u2019s civil war, arriving in Australia two years later. She is the first East Timorese-born Australian to be elected to parliament, having previously been a soldier and worked in the health and legal sectors.</p> <p>Nelson said her father, the East Timorese political leader Jo\u00e3o Carrascal\u00e3o, and her uncle, the former president Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta, taught her that \u201ca leader is only as strong as the weakest member of the community\u201d.</p> <p>She said housing and antisocial behaviour needed to be addressed as a priority in Katherine.</p> <p>\u201cIn an unfortunate situation, mirrored in many Northern Territory communities, Katherine has also been forged in part by a painful social inequity that transcends stereotypes and skin colour,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Yingiya Mark Guyula, who marked Labor\u2019s only defeat by winning the seat of Nhulunbuy from the former deputy leader, Lynne Walker, said he had not wanted to become a politician, but nothing else had worked to see Yolngu law recognised.<br></p> <p>Guyula, a Liya-dhalinymirr Djambarrpuyungu from East Arnhem Land, said he was elected to \u201cbring two parliaments together\u201d as a Yolngu diplomat, and he wanted to represent both Indigenous and non-Indigenous constituents.</p> <p>He tabled a statement on behalf of the Yolngu Nations Assembly, declaring ongoing Yolngu sovereignty and the validity of traditional law being equal to that of the Australian parliament.</p> <p>Guyula also spoke of the difficulties of living in two worlds \u2013 Yolngu and Balanda \u2013and the importance of bilingual education for Indigenous children.<br></p> <p>Guyula\u2019s election is facing a potential challenge over whether he was employed by the East Arnhem council at the time of his nomination, in breach of legislation.</p> <p>Selena Uibo, an Indigenous former educator<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/01/northern-territory-reintroduces-community-cabinet-meetings-in-remote-towns\"> elected to the remote seat of Arnhem</a>, said housing and roads were the biggest issues in remote communities, as well as improved services and early childhood education.</p> <p>Ngaree Ah Kit, an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander woman of Chinese descent and former mental health worker, said the government needed to do more to address the NT\u2019s suicide rate \u2013 the highest in the country.</p> <p>The newly elected member for Fong Lim, Jeff Collins, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/22/northern-territory-political-parties-called-upon-to-address-justice-crisis-\">issues in the justice system</a> had piqued his interest to run for the seat.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact the Northern Territory has the highest incarceration rate in the world must be deeply embarrassing to more than just me,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He said \u201ctough on crime\u201d policies did not work, and called for drug problems to be treated as a health issue rather than a criminal one.</p> <p>Independent Kezia Purick was reelected as speaker, with fellow Independent Gerry Wood noting it was her third tilt at the job, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/18/northern-territory-government-plays-musical-chairs-in-late-night-special\">after losing it for 40 minutes during an attempted midnight ousting last year</a>.</p>"
