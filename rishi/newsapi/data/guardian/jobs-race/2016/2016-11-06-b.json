  "<p>When I was a girl of 11 I had an argument with my father that left my psyche maimed. It was about whether a woman could be the president of the US.</p> <p>How did it even start? I was no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/feminism\">feminist</a> prodigy, just a shy kid who preferred reading to talking; politics weren\u2019t my destiny. Probably, I was trying to work out what was possible for my category of person \u2013 legally, logistically \u2013 as one might ask which kinds of terrain are navigable for a newly purchased bicycle. Up until then, gender hadn\u2019t darkened my mental doorway as I followed my older brother into our daily adventures wearing hand-me-down jeans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-criminal-james-comey\">James Comey: FBI has found no criminal wrongdoing in new Clinton emails</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in adolescence it dawned on me I\u2019d be spending my future as a woman, and when I looked around, alarm bells rang. My mother was a capable, intelligent, deeply unhappy woman who aspired to fulfilment as a housewife but clearly disliked the job. I saw most of my friends\u2019 mothers packed into that same dreary boat. My father was a country physician, admired and rewarded for work he loved. In my primordial search for a life coach, he was the natural choice.</p> <p>I probably started by asking him if girls could go to college, have jobs, be doctors, tentatively working my way up the ladder. His answers grew more equivocal until finally we faced off, Dad saying, \u201cNo\u201d and me saying, \u201cBut why not?\u201d A female president would be dangerous. His reasons vaguely referenced menstruation and emotional instability, innate female attraction to maternity and aversion to power, and a general implied ickyness that was beneath polite conversation.</p> <p>I ended that evening curled in bed with my fingernails digging into my palms and a silent howl tearing through me that lasted hours and left me numb. The next day I saw life at a remove, as if my skull had been jarred. What changed for me was not a dashing of specific hopes, but an understanding of what my father \u2013 the person whose respect I craved \u2013 really saw when he looked at me. I was tainted. I would grow up to be a lesser person, confined to an obliquely shameful life.</p> <p>But I didn\u2019t stop asking what a woman gets to do, and so began a lifelong confrontation with that internal howl. The slap-downs were often unexpected. Play drums in the band? No. Sign up for the science team? Go camping with the guys? Go jogging in shorts and a tank top without fear of being assaulted? Experiment boldly, have a career, command a moral authority of my own? Walk home safely after dark? No, no, no.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/06/why-do-we-love-a-trainwreck\">Why do successful women like Hillary Clinton get under so many people's skin?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eventually, I wrestled my way to yes on most of these things, except of course the last one. And the same dread that stalks me in dark parking lots \u2013 the helpless fury of knowing I don\u2019t get to be just a person here, going about my business \u2013 has haunted all the other pursuits, from science team to career. It\u2019s a matter of getting up each day and pushing myself again into a place some people think I have no right to occupy.</p> <p>My father is very old now. Lately, I brought up our ancient argument about who may occupy the White House, but he didn\u2019t remember it. The world has changed and so has he, urged forward by working daughters and granddaughters. He\u2019s ready and eager to vote for a woman president.

It\u2019s even harder to imagine Clinton indulging in the boorish self-aggrandisement, intellectual laziness, racism and vulgar contempt for the opposite gender that characterise her opponent. If anyone still doubts that the inexperienced man gets promoted ahead of the qualified woman, you can wake up now.</p> <p>This race is close. <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/ap-gfk-poll-most-believe-allegations-trump-women-193133070--election.html\">Polls tell us </a>most Americans believe Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/list-of-donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations\">sexually assaulted women</a> (to name just one potential disqualifier).

  "<p>Someone threw a dildo on to the playing&#xa0;field. It happened last Sunday, during the third quarter of&#xa0;<a href=\"http://mashable.com/2016/10/30/dildo-buffalo-bills-patriots-nfl/\" title=\"\">a&#xa0;nationally televised NFL game between the Buffalo Bills and the New England Patriots</a>. Millions of Americans watched, rolled their eyes and thought to themselves: \u201cWell, that about sums it up.\u201d</p> <p>So, who threw it? A Hillary supporter, obviously. Someone fed up with all the degradation women have been subjected to in this election: infidelity, groping, sexting, the whole septic undertow of alpha-male sludge currently spewing into the Atlantic and Pacific. And, finally, one lone heroine stood up and hurled an allegorical Johnson on to a football field, where it got trampled by 22 pairs of male feet.</p> <p>Or \u2026 was it a Trumpster? A lifelong blue-collar Buffaloan who has watched his city\u2019s industrial prowess wane? Maybe his daddy made dildos and his granddaddy made dildos, and then Hillary became senator and all those dildo jobs moved overseas. And now these New England Patriots \u2013&#xa0;east coast intellectual elites \u2013 show up with their&#xa0;crooked, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/us-sport/national-football-league/tom-brady-superstar-or-cheat-or-both-10255442.html\" title=\"\">ball-deflating quarterback, Tom Brady</a>, and humiliate Buffalo on their home field.&#xa0;So, in&#xa0;a&#xa0;desperate act of defiance, an angry&#xa0;man hurls&#xa0;an inferior Chinese-made dildo at&#xa0;the Patriots\u2019 offence. A way of saying: \u201cThe Revolution Has Begun.\u201d</p> <p>Make no mistake: it was a political event. Americans are frustrated and they are throwing dildos. They\u2019re fed up and they don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass if the rest of the world is laughing at them. The air of \u201cfresh start\u201d is no longer alive in most places in America. We are sleepwalking into oblivion and for those, like me, raised in the twilight of a world where being president was still&#xa0;a noble thing, it cuts pretty deep. History has&#xa0;always been able to extract some shred of sacrosanctity from the electoral process, no matter how awful it turned out. But it\u2019s looking as if that warranty has expired and our republic is now an ageing Maytag churning through its final rinse cycle. Whatever comes out is going to be damp, foetid and reeking of effluviant. And we\u2019re gonna have to wear it.</p> <p>If Trump wins, I\u2019m going to enjoy the spectacle of a man wrestling within himself. Driven by inherent narcissism, he would strive to be The Greatest President Ever, a trait we look for in our leaders. But if his itchy-finger temperament prevails, he might nuke Egypt simply because they lied about the cotton threadcount in his bedsheets.</p> <p>Hillary, on the other hand, is a dead-eyed cyborg, held together with rivets and WD-40. She has been encamped in our lives for so long that handing her the presidency somehow feels like a&#xa0;lifetime achievement award. But she\u2019s dirty and corrupt and contemptuous of national security. These are our choices, folks: a pair of assholes. What is an asshole? A person who thinks they\u2019re entitled to an advantage. A person who has immunised themselves against all criticism.</p> <p>They can\u2019t hear your complaints. They\u2019re too caught up in their own ambition. It\u2019s OK to be an asshole if you have talent. Pablo Picasso and Miles Davis were assholes, but we forgave them because they gave something back. And the reason they were assholes was because they couldn\u2019t abide anything that got in the way of their talent or vision. But Trump has no talent. And Hillary has no vision. No fresh vision, anyway. So the American voter has a dilemma. \u201cLet\u2019s see, should I go with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2016/live-updates/general-election/real-time-fact-checking-and-analysis-of-the-first-presidential-debate/fact-check-has-trump-declared-bankruptcy-four-or-six-times/\" title=\"\">a six-times-bankrupt businessman</a> who once thought it was a genius idea to sell steaks at The Sharper Image? Or the woman who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/hillary-clinton-latest-emails-explained\" title=\"\">might as well be reading her top-level-security emails off the jumbotron at Yankee Stadium</a>?</p> <p>Frankly, I don\u2019t know how history is going to spit-polish this one. America\u2019s greatest attribute has always been its ability to mythologise its stupid mistakes, to turn world-class blunders into cultural gold. We glorify our exceptionalism. We downplay our history of slavery, segregation, nativism and violence until we can find a way to&#xa0;turn it into a Hollywood blockbuster starring Chiwetel Ejiofor. Unlike Brits, we always forgive ourselves. But I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re ever going to illuminate Trump or Clinton with any kind of flattering historical rewrite.</p> <p>Besides, they have already been encapsulated perfectly in films: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/23/back-to-the-future-writer-bad-guy-biff-was-based-on-donald-trump\" title=\"\">Biff in Back to the Future</a> and Mary Tyler Moore in Ordinary People.</p> <p>Who am I going to vote for? Hillary. Only because she lies 30% less than Trump. I\u2019m tempted to sit this whole thing out, but I can\u2019t. I still believe in the antiquated currency of the ballot. I am grateful, as an American, that two useful idiots have offered themselves up as scapegoats for everything wrong with my country. That\u2019s the beauty of having a president. When the world isn\u2019t treating us right, when the creepy kid at school goes out and shoots up the mall, when we\u2019re up to our asses in floodwater and raw sewage because the county commissioners didn\u2019t buy enough sandbags to shore up the levee, who has to show up and apologise? The president, that\u2019s who.</p> <p>Every night, the president crawls into bed and says: \u201cGuess what, honey? Half the people in the country today called me an asshole!\u201d</p> <p>God bless \u2019em.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Rich Hall\u2019s Presidential Grudge Match airs on 7 November at 9pm on BBC4.</em></p>",
  "<p>When the close-to-capacity crowd at Soldier Field were subjected to the caterwauling version of Ireland\u2019s Call, played with a bit of blarney on a violin, the day seemed to be heading only south. Moments later it was yanked back and pointed upwards, with the Ireland players facing the haka by forming a perfect figure of eight in memory of Anthony Foley. It was one of the great rescue acts. And not the last on a remarkable day.</p> <p>What followed was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/05/ireland-new-zealand-rugby-union-report\" title=\"\">classic Test match</a>, not for its low error count or non-stop action \u2013 there were lots of spills and the whole thing took an age to complete \u2013 but for the way it developed into a familiar and gripping theme: underdogs set the pace, and then are visibly running out of energy as they are chased down. The history of the fixture only heightened the prize.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/05/ireland-new-zealand-rugby-union-report\">Ireland clinch first ever win over  All Blacks to end New Zealand's record streak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many All Blacks reach for the line that they do not want to be the first ones to lose to Ireland. That will be amended in a fortnight into not wanting to be the first to lose back-to-back in this fixture. Technically there are speed bumps to get out of the way before the teams meet again in Dublin on 19 November \u2013 New Zealand have Italy in Rome on Saturday while Ireland take on Canada in Dublin \u2013 but the interim is all about what we will get when we tune in to the rematch.</p> <p>\u201cIt is easy when you win, you give yourself a pat on the back,\u201d said the All Blacks coach, Steve Hansen. But when you lose you give yourself a wee uppercut because there are things you have got to get better at. We have to go away and look at where they beat us, how they beat us and how we are going to get better so that in a fortnight\u2019s time we can contest the game.\u201d</p> <p>It is almost certain that effort will be made without the hugely influential, and now hamstrung, Ryan Crotty \u2013 his departure was felt most when the All Blacks were chasing Ireland down \u2013 and George Moala. On the upside both Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitlock are expected to hook up with the squad pre-Rome, with Retallick the better bet of the two to feature against Ireland in Dublin.</p> <p>Now they need, literally, an uplift at the lineout. In a nightmarish first half for New Zealand their stats out of touch were just that. By the break they were 57%, and while they had recovered to 80% at the finish the damage had been done. Ireland\u2019s maul was very good, their tackle completions were first class until falling off a few in the final quarter. And their discipline was on a different chart to that of the All Blacks, conceding only four penalties against New Zealand\u2019s 12.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/nov/06/ireland-full-of-respect-for-the-all-blacks-after-historic-win-says-rory-best-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5apq9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2872971\"            data-video-name=\"Ireland full of respect for the All Blacks after historic win, says Rory Best \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"SNTV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581f2a2ae4b07ceadb3a2f23\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/06/161106irelandup_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/06/161106irelandup.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/06/161106irelandup_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/nov/06/ireland-full-of-respect-for-the-all-blacks-after-historic-win-says-rory-best-video\">Ireland full of respect for the All Blacks after historic win, says Rory Best</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It all contributed to that commanding half-time lead of 25\u20138. And when it got out to 30\u20138 early in the second half, with Simon Zebo\u2019s try \u2013 Ireland\u2019s fourth \u2013 the Kiwis looked badly rattled as they gathered behind their own posts. Brilliant efforts from the replacement TJ Perenara and Ben Smith changed the picture into one where Ireland would have to score again rather than try to hang on for the final 15 minutes.</p> <p>And that\u2019s what made this game different. In 2013 Ireland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/24/ireland-new-zealand-autumn-internationals\" title=\"\">were caught in overtime</a> having led 22-7 at half-time; in 2001 they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2001/nov/19/rugbyunion.newzealandrugbyunionteam\" title=\"\">16-7 ahead at the break at Lansdowne Road</a>, and when Denis Hickie scored early in the second half the packed house were convinced that game 15 in the series would deliver a win.

In that sequence of securing the territory, providing the platform with another perfect scrum, and then having the accuracy to score straight off the set piece, Ireland made a statement that had been beyond them in 2013.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/06/cj-stander-dedicates-ireland-victory-all-blacks-anthony-foley\">CJ Stander dedicates Ireland victory over All Blacks to Anthony Foley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For that Joe Schmidt can take great credit. The reality is that pre-game in Chicago he looked like a coach who wanted to get through the day as quickly as possible, and with limited damage. Schmidt did not believe the preparation time en route to the US would allow his team to be close, never mind win. But the New Zealander has done more than he realises with this group.</p> <p>Now he has a fortnight to fine-tune the stuff that will make his team harder to beat. That effort will be without Jordi Murphy, who has a suspected anterior cruciate ligament problem, but both Sean O\u2019Brien and Peter O\u2019Mahony got more miles on the road this weekend against Zebre and Ospreys respectively.

  "<p>The enduring impact of closing factories and shutting coalmines in the 1980s has been revealed in new research showing that the drain on the exchequer from former industrial areas is responsible for up to half the government\u2019s \u00a355bn budget deficit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/06/the-legacy-of-leaving-old-industrial-britain-to-rot-is-becoming-clear\">The legacy of leaving old industrial Britain to rot is becoming clear | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the first comprehensive analysis of the cost to the state of the de-industrialisation that began three decades ago, Sheffield Hallam University said the annual bill was at least \u00a320bn and was perhaps as high as \u00a330bn.</p> <p>The report found that the cumulative legacy of the hollowing-out of manufacturing and the year-long miners\u2019 strike of 1984-85 was a far heavier concentration of people claiming incapacity benefits than in the richer parts of Britain and a more widespread use of tax credits to top up the wages of those in low-paid jobs.</p> <p>The report\u2019s co-author, Prof Steve Fothergill, said: \u201cThe long-term effect of job destruction in older industrial Britain has been to park vast numbers out of the labour market on incapacity benefits, these days employment and support allowance (ESA). The cost to the Treasury is immense, especially if all the top-up benefits are included. </p> <p>\u201cAdded to this, low wages in these weaker local economies have jacked up spending on in-work benefits such as tax credits and reduced income tax revenue. None of these impacts have diminished over the years, despite the recent upturn and efforts to cut claimant numbers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/incapacity-zip/giv-1406G0rq42Z5gPoE/\" data-alt=\"incapacity\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/incapacity-zip/giv-1406G0rq42Z5gPoE/\">incapacity</a> </figure>  <p> \u201cWe estimate that the ongoing cost to the exchequer, in extra benefit spending and lost tax revenue, is at least \u00a320bn a year, and possibly nearer \u00a330bn.

In Blaenau Gwent and Neath Port Talbot in South Wales, and in Glasgow, the incapacity claimant rate was 11.9%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/job_losses-zip/giv-1406RjzOXiorOqPV/\" data-alt=\"job losses\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/job_losses-zip/giv-1406RjzOXiorOqPV/\">job losses</a> </figure>  <p>In areas where the local economy was strong, there were much lower incapacity claimant rates. Only one London borough, Islington, featured in the top 100, with only four other districts in the south-east featuring, all of them seaside towns.</p> <p>Fothergill and his co-author, Christina Beatty, said the UK spent \u00a334bn a year on working-age incapacity benefits once housing benefits and tax credits were added to ESA. Of this, they said \u00a310bn-\u00a314bn was the cost of job destruction in older industrial Britain.</p> <p>They added that higher claimant count unemployment in the old industrial areas was costing the exchequer a further \u00a31bn-\u00a31.5bn a year. </p> <p>The study estimated that the government was also subsidising the poorly paid jobs that had replaced those lost in manufacturing in the older industrial areas to the tune of \u00a310bn a year. Spending on tax credits exceeded \u00a3850 per head a year, double the level in southern Britain.</p> <p>As a result, the poorer parts of Britain were vulnerable to the freezing of non-pensioner benefits, including tax credits, which Osborne announced for the duration of the current parliament. The study estimated that the average working age adult in the older industrial regions would lose \u00a3750 a year by 2020-21, whereas the average loss in Cambridge would be \u00a3340.</p> <p>It added: \u201cThe Treasury has misdiagnosed high welfare spending as the result of inadequate work incentives and has too often blamed individuals for their own predicament, whereas in fact a large part of the bill is rooted in job destruction extending back decades.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>During my maternity leave I had a conversation with a guy at a party, where he regretfully told me that as long as men couldn\u2019t give birth, equality would never be a reality. Perhaps women just aren\u2019t meant to work, he concluded. Maybe not! I replied brightly, later deciding not to tell him he was trailing toilet paper from his shoe.</p> <p>I felt really lucky a couple of months later, to return to a job that I care about where they agreed to let me work from home one day a week. Especially as I saw so many friends of friends made redundant weeks after having their babies, or encouraged to leave just before in a flurry of meetings in which they were chastised for not having replied to emails with the correct greeting or for taking the full hour for lunch. Even the wealthy aren\u2019t immune. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/keiraknightley\">Keira Knightley</a>, upon returning to work this week after having a baby, talked about Britain\u2019s \u201carchaic\u201d maternity laws. \u201cYou need to be a family unit, not just have the guy there for two weeks and then go back to work and the mother is left desperately trying to figure it out,\u201d she said of paternity leave, the new rules on which will only have an effect if businesses actively encourage fathers to take the time off, and if colleagues don\u2019t quietly roll their eyes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You need to be a family unit, not just have the guy there for two weeks and then go back to work</p> <footer> <cite>Keira Knightley</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More than three-quarters of pregnant women and new mothers \u2013 the equivalent of 390,000 of us \u2013 experience what they call \u201cnegative and potentially discriminatory treatment\u201d and what my friends call \u201cfuckery\u201d at work each year. A new <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/managing-pregnancy-and-maternity-workplace/pregnancy-and-maternity-discrimination-research-findings\">report from the Equality and Human Rights Commission</a> confirms the stories I heard in those long mornings pushing buggies round parks with NCT survivors, that 11% of women are pushed out of their jobs following maternity leave \u2013 around 54,000 a year. And because of this, British businesses are losing \u00a3280m in hiring, training, payouts and lost productivity every year. All to avoid a bit of change.</p> <p>And, as if the arrogance and unfairness of this wasn\u2019t enough, then, THEN you realise one of the side-effects of all these pregnant redundancies was the invention of the \u201cmumpreneur\u201d. I can\u2019t help but imagine the 54,000 newly unemployed mothers as a wounded army, stranded after the war ends, looking out at the sea with a mixture of hope and fear. Inevitably, some will deal with this by launching a linen baby-sling company. Perhaps a business selling personalised suede nappy bags, or organic cot bedding, or \u00a3200 mittens. I know I\u2019m being a patronising dick, but do put that aside for a second, stick it over by the WaterWipes, and ask whether these women would have launched their unnecessary businesses if they weren\u2019t themselves feeling superfluous. If they hadn\u2019t had their careers cut off at the elbow as soon as they felt their first child kick. If the companies they worked for had taken the time to reshape around their female staff, and adapt to new schedules rather than just shrugging, \u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>I feel similarly about the weight of mummy blogs that threatens to sink the internet. For every <a href=\"http://www.mumsnet.com/\">Mumsnet</a> there are a thousand Mumsnots, either reports on how many times its author has cried that day, the comments a circle-jerk of struggle, or else a filtered reverie of a perfect life, necessary to wangle free yogurt. As time goes on, I\u2019m starting to find one as fantastical as the other. Even in the honesty blogs, it\u2019s not possible to be truly honest. Because to do that would surely mean saying: \u201cI want real people to talk to. This is not enough.\u201d Again, I\u2019m being dickish, but between the lines you so often see a woman who wants to be recognised, who wants to be around people and produce something that people need, who has found themselves blunted, without a point.</p> <p>It is possible to run a small business and have children. It should also be possible to run a big business and have children, and to be an employee, and to invent something unrelated to your child\u2019s bathtime. Starting a business is isolating, it\u2019s low-paid, it\u2019s difficult to plan a future \u2013 it\u2019s often a last resort. The modern view of a self-employed mum officing at her kitchen table says more about crippling childcare costs and inhospitable workplace cultures than it does a utopian future where we can have it all. Maternity discrimination birthed the mumpreneur.

  "<p>Alicia Keys has taken over Times Square, bringing five blocks of one of the busiest areas of the western world to its knees. Her \u201csecret\u201d gig tonight is not so secret. She\u2019ll commandeer the epic digital billboards and her face \u2013 lightly freckled and without makeup, as is her way these days \u2013 will flash all over American Eagle Outfitters.</p> <p>Times Square is Keys\u2019s back yard. She was born in Hell\u2019s Kitchen in 1981 and grew up in a one-bedroom apartment on 43rd Street between 9th and 10th Avenue. Her teenage years coincided with the tenure of Mayor Rudy Giuliani: the street is now quietly gentrified, and features the Manhattan Plaza Health Club.</p> <p>She has booked the entire 57th floor of the W hotel to dress for the gig, rest, and do this interview in promotion of <a href=\"http://www.aliciakeys.com/alicia-announces-new-album-and-debuts-new-single/\"><em>Here</em></a>, her first album in four years. Her complicated management system functions like an onion. There is an outer layer of nervy young people glued to Samsungs, a middle layer of big characters in bomber jackets who emerge before show time and hand out laminates, and an inner layer \u2013 Key\u2019s confidants and partners in her company, AK Worldwide: longtime manager and co-writer Erika Rose (headscarf and curly haired child in sling), and DJ Walton \u2013 who is, among many things, a vocal coach and boxing coach with two full sleeves of tattoos.</p> <p>The machinery around the star exists as a shock absorber, and Alicia\u2019s suite is almost temple-like in its serenity. Four shadowy figures sit on high-backed chairs, like guests at a strange, gloomy dinner party. Two cameramen swoop around the room, filming the proceedings \u2013 everyone from Beyonc\u00e9 to Janelle Mon\u00e1e has their own personal film team these days, capturing your interview for their \u201cpersonal archive\u201d, or their legal department.</p> <p>In the corner is a girl in a headscarf and jeans who looks so unassuming I think it\u2019s another assistant.

Mum had attended NYU\u2019s School of the Arts and worked on and off as an actor. She started her daughter young: at four, Alicia got a part in <em>The Cosby Show</em>, as one of Rudy Huxtable\u2019s sleepover guests, and can be seen, small and giggling, riding Bill\u2019s leg like a bucking bronco.</p> <p>At 12, in 1993, she attended the newly created, publicly funded Professional Performing Arts School, 10 minutes walk from home and just off Broadway. Claire Danes and Britney Spears were pupils at one time. She was tutored by \u201cMiss Aziza\u2026\u201d she says wistfully. <a href=\"http://www.azizamiller.com/\">Aziza Miller</a> \u2013 \u201cOne of the most phenomenal women jazz instructors ever to be born. She was a pianist, an arranger, a producer, a composer, and she had so much vocal prowess. She was badass.

When Keys released her first single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Urdlvw0SSEc\">Fallin\u2019</a>, in 2001 she already had a certain kind of pedigree.

In July, Keys\u2019s charitable foundation, <a href=\"http://weareheremovement.com/\">We Are Here,</a> put together a protest film \u2013<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_VaNhI4CLo\"> \u201c23 Ways You Could Be Killed If You Are Black in America\u201d</a> \u2013 which featured Rihanna and Pharrell Williams. I ask what she thought when her old landlord, Giuliani, said \u2013 in response to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/08/beyonce-black-panthers-homage-black-lives-matter-super-bowl-50\">tribute to the Panthers</a> at the Superbowl 50 halftime show \u2013 that he\u2019d \u201csaved more black lives than anyone on that stage\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t pay attention to things that don\u2019t need to be paid attention to,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cMusicians have a really big part to play in spreading messages because they\u2019re able to reach a large portion of people on an emotional level. Artists reach people at their heart; it\u2019s the only time we meet in one place and put our differences aside. When you\u2019re in a forum listening to music, all you feel in that moment is love and the understanding.\u201d</p> <p>Keys has known her husband, the producer <a href=\"http://www.swizzworld.com/\">Swizz Beatz</a> (Kasseem Dean), since she was about 16, though they took years to get together. Kanye West once called Dean, 38, the best rap producer of all time. His more unusual accolades include global ambassador for New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, and a place at Harvard Business School. Dean already had three children when he married Keys in 2010. His first son, Prince Nasir, with Nicole Levy, is 16. There\u2019s another, Kasseem, with Harlem songwriter Mashonda Tifrere, singer of the song <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/30612707\">No Panties</a>. And a girl, Nicole, by Jahna Sebastian, whose website claims she helped bring grime to Russia.</p> <p>Keys faced her share of scandal with the relationship, and covers it in the new single B<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWACsH1f2So\">lended Family (What You Do for Love)</a>, which includes a direct address to her stepchildren: \u201cI know it started with a little drama/ I hate you had to read it in the paper/ But everything\u2019s alright with me and your momma\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about my personal journey with my family, and creating a family that\u2019s built on compassion and understanding,\u201d she says, in her broad, new age-y way. \u201cThat\u2019s not an easy road. A lot of the modern family is children from different relationships. That\u2019s what family is today, and there\u2019s never been a song about how beautiful it is. There\u2019s no end to what the family dynamic can look like, as long as it is filled with love for the kids. \u201d</p> <p>Her stepchildren, she says, call her Umi, which is Arabic for mother. Kasseem Dean is Muslim: \u201c4 years of greatness and cheers to 100 plus more inshallah\u201d he Instagrammed, on their anniversary. I ask her if she has converted to Islam. There is a pause, then she says:</p> <p>\u201cI love learning about different religions, and discovering the different ways to worship, and to love the greatness and the higher being that surrounds us all. I definitely believe in a bigger presence, and I really respect all religions; at their core they all teach the same message \u2013 community and kindness and looking out for each other.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HazJhPnrB8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4HazJhPnrB8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HazJhPnrB8\">Watch the video for Alicia Keys\u2019s In Common.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Growing up, she rarely saw her own father, Craig Cook \u2013 an air steward of Jamaican background, who became a masseur \u2013 but she maintained a close relationship with his parents (though her father\u2019s absence was not, she points out, \u201cexactly a topic for the dinner table\u201d).</p> <p>\u201cI did have a deeper relationship with my nana than I did with my father, and again, that\u2019s how life goes. There\u2019s no rulebook. My grandmother was a very loving woman. The table would be filled with Christmas cards. She could cook really well too \u2013 and then one day, she just decided to stop. My grandfather had passed. Something just changes, you know?\u201d</p> <p>When her grandmother became terminally ill in 2006, Keys took off for Egypt for three weeks by herself. That a single holiday had such a formative impact on her reminds you how young she was when fame hit. She named the first of her two sons Egypt, five years later. Like his namesake with its \u201cimpossible structures\u201d, Egypt Dean loves to build. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s obsessed. He\u2019s like an architect.\u201d</p> <p>At five years old, the tot already has a co-credit producing a song for Kendrick Lamar \u2013 untitled 07, on Lamar\u2019s <em>untitled unmastered</em> album (sample lyric: \u201cshut your fucking mouth and get some cash you bitch!\u201d). He was <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/6898221/swizz-beatz-son-egypt-dean-kendrick-lamar-untitled-unmastered-project\">posted on Instagram by his father</a>, playing a piano intro. \u201cHe really did it,\u201d she assures me. \u201cHe came up with it, heard the melody, picked it out on his piano, and brought it to the studio. Played it, programmed it. It\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d Egypt watched Superbowl 50 sitting next to Kendrick, Jay Z and Usher.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t listen to anything Donald Trump says.\u00a0Does anybody care what he thinks about women?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Keys has said that having children has made her feel more womanly. \u201cAs I grow and I get older I\u2019m realising more and more that there\u2019s such a beautiful, sensual power that we have as women,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really unbelievable and that\u2019s why everybody falls to our feet.\u201d</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.lennyletter.com/style/a410/alicia-keys-time-to-uncover/\">a piece for Lena Dunham\u2019s Lenny newsletter</a>, she explained the decision to go without makeup which has gripped the world \u2013 from the TV hosts on NBC\u2019s <em>Today</em> morning news show, who <a href=\"http://www.today.com/style/tamron-hall-take-anchors-shed-makeup-after-alicia-keys-performance-t102506\">wiped their own off in solidarity</a>, to the messageboards of Muslim girls debating the difference between liberation and empowerment. The stuff made her feel like a \u201cchameleon\u201d, she says. Going without it is a terrific marketing trick: she even wrote a lyric that goes, \u201cMaybe all this Maybelline is covering my esteem\u201d. And her makeup artist recently revealed that the no-makeup look <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2016/oct/10/alicia-keys-no-makeup-look-not-quite-real\">actually requires quite a bit of makeup</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ce1f12c57424c740f2ecb41bd645da78ba974fc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce1f12c57424c740f2ecb41bd645da78ba974fc8/0_0_6208_6934/895.jpg\" alt=\"Alicia Keys\" width=\"895\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alicia Keys: \u2018Mary J Blige really resonated with me because she was from New York.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paola Kudacki</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the campaign certainly suits Keys\u2019s muted, delicately retro R&amp;B persona. Like an American Neneh Cherry, what she was doing 15 years ago feels significant now. Compared with the modern-day vogue for ironic sluttiness, and the subsequent nail-biting over what it means to be feminist in pop, Keys and many of her contemporaries around the millennium offered something comparatively nuanced. Like TLC, her style was boyish \u2013 trousers, boots and braids \u2013 but her lyrics examined love and its vulnerability. One of her signature songs, You Don\u2019t Know My Name, feels almost quaint now, as she poses as a waitress and rings the guy in the \u201cfly blue suit\u201d to ask him out: \u201cI know girls don\u2019t usually do this\u2026\u201d</p> <p>It was a relaxed kind of self-possession, girl power without a soapbox. When I ask her what was going on, she lights up.</p> <p>\u201cIt was good, it was so good,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the 1990s, with Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, those really big female artists were very glamorous, it was all about the glamour at that time. And so there was a big switch, the desire to be more who you were, not so beholden to this whole standard of beauty. It was a liberation. You see Mary J Blige \u2013 she did the same, wearing the combat boots.\u201d</p> <p>So it was an attitude, as much as a fashion?</p> <p>\u201cYeah, definitely. Mary really resonated with me because she was from New York, and that\u2019s what New York looked like: it wasn\u2019t like a beauty pageant, it was a hard, grimy place, and you had to dress accordingly. That represented the type of girl that I was, so that worked for me.\u201d</p> <p>Does she think there\u2019s been a change, in the way female R&amp;B looks now?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/21/alicia-keys-review-roundhouse-london\">Alicia Keys review \u2013 soul singer opens door to blistering basement bash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYes. To me, it just seems like there\u2019s a lot less variety,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you talk about the TLCs, or the Marys, you had a chance to see women in different orbits. [TLC\u2019s] Chilli was one way, T-Boz had a whole other style. Now, I think we see almost only one thing when it comes to female performers. Obviously they\u2019re beautiful, so you want to emulate that. But I think there\u2019s some confusion as to what beauty looks like \u2013 it can only be oversexualised. What\u2019s refreshing is when you see people who know how to express themselves in a multitude of ways.</p> <p>\u201cWe think \u2013 or maybe we\u2019re shown \u2013 that the only way to express ourselves is through that very sexy energy. I think there\u2019s more than that which shows our power. For me, I sometimes feel the most sexy when I\u2019m totally covered head to toe.\u201d</p> <p>We meet in the week that it was revealed that Donald Trump <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/donald-trump-howard-stern-tapes-women-35_uk_57fa46e1e4b01fa2b904368b\">acknowledged that his daughter is a piece of ass \u2013 and that 35 is the age he tends to check out on a woman</a>.</p> <p>She cracks her knuckles unnervingly loudly. \u201cI don\u2019t listen to anything that he says. Does anybody care what he thinks about women? That\u2019s the only question. I just was wondering?\u201d</p> <p>Does she think the comments might have ruined Trump?</p> <p>\u201cTo me, he\u2019s never been in.\u201d</p> <p>Can she see another black president?</p> <p>\u201cYes. Just as I can see a woman president.\u201d</p> <p>One of the shadowy dinner party guests moves forward, and calls time.</p> <p>\u201cI guess come with me to the little soundcheck thing,\u201d says Keys.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34be26b5f53e68be3b4dc3a8ff5d9717d05b5f66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34be26b5f53e68be3b4dc3a8ff5d9717d05b5f66/0_0_3000_1996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keys performing Empire State of Mind with Jay Z as part of her album launch in Times Square last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keys performing Empire State of Mind with Jay Z as part of her album launch in Times Square last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Gershoff/Getty Images for Alicia Keys</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She enters Times Square on the arm of a young male assistant, a Starbucks in one hand and a big hooded blanket over her headscarf, with mirrored sunglasses, looking like Erykah Badu.</p> <p>The video for Blended Family \u2013 her sober song of inclusion \u2013 flashes up and down the length of the buildings like a Benetton ad. At the back of the VIP section, Kasseem Dean, in a posh camel coat, holds two small boys wearing New York baseball caps.</p> <p>Keys smashes out delicious, Gershwinesque chords on an upright piano. She sounds like a female Stevie Wonder. And throwing her arms up, she becomes an ambassador. For Black Lives Matter: \u201cDon\u2019t let these people make you think we are different from each other. I feel like we have devolved!\u201d For women: \u201cWithout women there would be no humans!\u201d And for mums everywhere: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than being cold at a concert.\u201d</p> <p>And finally, the bit the crowd have been waiting for: \u201cThis ignorant racist jackass whose name rhymes with scum has the nerve to talk about grabbing pussy? If you care about your life then vote for it. Please.\u201d</p> <p>When Jay Z joins her on stage for Empire State of Mind, the taxis of Times Square appear to be drifting silently in the slipstream of the song. Tourists emerging from Broadway theatres get an experience they couldn\u2019t have paid for \u2013 and which the teenage Keys, making her way to some vocal class round the corner years ago, almost certainly never imagined.</p> <p><em>Here is out now on RCA Records</em></p>"
