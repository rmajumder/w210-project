  "<p>Companies should remove candidates\u2019 names from job applications and offer flexible working from the outset of the recruitment process to create a more dynamic and diverse workforce, according to employers\u2019 body the CBI.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/time-for-action\">new report</a>, published on Monday, the CBI will highlight the economic and social challenges facing the UK that have been \u201cthrown into sharp relief by Brexit\u201d and focus on issues of productivity and inclusion.</p> <p>\u201cWith UK productivity second from bottom of the G7, employee engagement is now more than ever crucial to driving productivity. But here too there\u2019s a problem. Of the world\u2019s 12 largest economies the UK ranks ninth for levels of engagement,\u201d said Paul Drechsler, president of the CBI.</p> <p>\u201cRaising engagement isn\u2019t about slapping another zero on the budget for the staff Christmas party. It\u2019s a complex process which takes time and hard work,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Philip Hammond, appointed chancellor after the Brexit vote, has vowed to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/03/philip-hammond-to-set-out-his-stall-for-balanced-budget-at-tory-conference\">improve Britain\u2019s lacklustre productivity</a>. Data from<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/06/uk-productivity-back-at-pre-financial-crisis-level-office-for-national-statistics\"> earlier this month</a> showed UK productivity was 27, 30 and 35 percentage points lower than in France, the US and Germany respectively.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In a speech, Drechsler will highlight the importance of the recruitment process to get people with the correct skills into jobs to increase productivity and make the workplace inclusive. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/sep/19/women-more-likely-get-graduate-jobs-too-few-apply\">Women are more likely to get graduate jobs, so why do fewer apply?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He described \u201cunconscious bias\u201d as a big challenge. \u201cThe first time many come into contact with this in the workplace is during job applications. One of the ways of tackling this is name-blind applications, removing criteria that could unintentionally bias managers and give under-represented groups confidence that their application will be fairly considered,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The CBI is looking at introducing such a practice and its report comes after a move a year ago by employers such as banking group HSBC, the BBC and accountants KPMG \u2013 and the university application scheme Ucas \u2013 to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/26/ucas-name-blind-university-applications-racial-bias\"> commit to disregard an employee\u2019 name</a>. The CBI also cited statistics from the CIPD showing that one in five female jobseekers from an ethnic minority have changed their name on a job application.</p> <p>\u201cFlexible working can be a vital enabler too. It\u2019s time we stopped seeing flexible working as a \u2018bonus for staff\u2019 and started seeing it as something which has clear benefits for employers and employees alike. It helps everyone balance their working lives not just with their responsibilities as parents or carers but also with their wellbeing and interests outside of work,\u201d said Drechsler.</p>",
  "<p>Tesco workers are taking legal action against their employer on grounds of age and gender discrimination after the supermarket cut its pay rates for night and weekend shifts.</p> <p>A group of 17 long-serving employees, who joined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco\">Tesco</a> before 1999, are fighting the cut in wages introduced in July this year. Lawyers believe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/06/corporate-governance-tesco-ranked-lowest-of-ftse-100-firms\">up to 38,000 staff who are paid by the hour could be affected</a>.</p> <p>Tesco announced the changes in February and they had been agreed in consultation with the shopworkers\u2019 trade union, Usdaw, and staff representatives. The company said an accompanying 3.1% pay rise to \u00a37.62 per hour made it one of the highest payers in the retail industry. But staff who used to receive double time for Sunday or bank holiday shifts saw their pay slashed to time and a half.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/tesco-supermarket-sales-rise-profits-tumble\">Tesco sales overshadowed by \u00a35.9bn pension hole</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Leigh Day, the legal firm acting for the claimants, has written to Tesco asking them how many of Tesco\u2019s staff who are paid by the hour \u2013 who are mostly over 40 years old \u2013 are affected. All staff taken on before 5 July 1999 have seen their benefits reduced.</p> <p>Paula Lee, of Leigh Day\u2019s employment and discrimination department, said: \u201cThe decision to impose pay cuts on long-serving employees is a bitter pill for our clients to swallow and we believe it is discriminatory. There seems to be a growing trend amongst retailers to cut staff wages and use those savings across other areas of the business.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the longer-serving staff in these retail organisations who usually suffer. Understandably our clients feel their loyalty is being taken advantage of; that the employer knows they are unlikely to leave their jobs and, in turn, that makes them feel vulnerable to further \u2018no choice\u2019 pay cuts.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Tesco said: \u201cEarlier this year we announced a pay increase of up to 3.1% for colleagues working in our stores across the UK, in addition to a 5% turnaround bonus. As part of the pay negotiations we also agreed to simplify premium payments to ensure a fair and consistent approach for all colleagues. The minority of colleagues who were negatively impacted by this change were supported with an agreed lump sum transition payment.\u201d</p> <p>The transition payment was equivalent to the loss in pay over the next 18 months. Tesco did not confirm how many workers were affected but said it was a small number. </p> <p>A similar dispute is simmering at Marks &amp; Spencer, which reduced the earnings of about 10% of its shop-floor workers by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/marks-and-spencer-staff-jobs-pensions-pay-working-conditions\">cutting premium payments for those working antisocial hours</a> in July.</p> <p>Leigh Day said it is also representing thousands of employees in discrimination claims against Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s.</p>",

The early breakaway was led by Ramirez of Colombia, Morocco\u2019s Anass Ait el Abdia, Sergiy Lagkuti of Ukraine, Ryan Roth of Canada, Eritrea\u2019s Natnael Berhane, Nick Dougall of South Africa, and the Mexican Rene Corella. The lead group is about 10 minutes ahead of the peloton, at the head of which Mark Cavendish is being assiduously looked after by Steve Cummings, and his GB team-mates.</p> <p>It looks mercilessly scorching out there, as they head towards the turn.

  "<p>At the end of one of the toughest world championships in many years, through the desert north of Doha, Mark Cavendish ended up just over a bike length away from the second world road title of his career, taking the silver medal behind Peter Sagan, who became one of a select few male professionals to win a second successive title.</p> <p>Cavendish was balked twice as the strong men \u2013 among the 18 survivors of desert heat, high winds and sandstorms \u2013 fought out the sprint. First he opted to remain on Sagan\u2019s wheel as his lead-out man Adam Blythe \u2013 an excellent 12th in the end \u2013 began his effort to the left, visibly seeking out Cavendish but to no avail.</p> <p>Sagan\u2019s was, indeed, the wheel to follow but, as the Slovak nipped through a gap between the Italian Giacomo Nizzolo and the barriers, Cavendish seemed to realise in an instant that option might not work and moved right. That meant he had to find his way through the other riders and, while he clearly had more than enough speed to do so, he had to stall momentarily in order to move round the Australian Mike Matthews. At terminal velocity in a sprint finish he was simply left with too much to do to overhaul Sagan, who said afterwards that he was fortunate that Nizzolo was courteous enough not to shut the door on him by moving right.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a little bit disappointed. I feel I\u2019ve lost gold, not won silver,\u201d Cavendish said, having ridden with the after-effects of a training crash on Thursday which had been heavy enough for him to be taken to hospital for checks on a finger. \u201cI was [on Sagan\u2019s wheel], all of a sudden the road was blocked. I tried to find a way through \u2013 with less than 100m to go I had to stop pedalling and come round Matthews. By then it was just too late.\u201d</p> <p>Cavendish and Sagan were both outnumbered in the 28-rider group that survived to the final kilometres after the race split to smithereens with around 180km to go but they made the best of the tactical situation with the big disappointment reserved for the nations that had dominated the group: Belgium, who had six riders in the lead group but ended up with only Tom Boonen\u2019s bronze to show for it, and Norway and Italy, who had three men apiece but left Doha empty-handed.</p> <p>The crucial moments came as the peloton had just completed the initial 80km north out of Doha and prepared to turn south. There was a brief, intense battle for position before a first right turn in the desert into a crosswind, where Great Britain and Belgium forced an initial split in the space of a minute, with some 40 riders going clear as the two teams hit over 60km an hour, while occupying just enough road space to deny the bulk of the field any shelter. With most riders close to their limit, all it then took was one of the Belgians placed further back down the line to let a gap open and the damage was done.</p> <p>There were immediate casualties: the Britons Luke Rowe and Geraint Thomas both punctured at key moments, with no service cars available, while sprinters, such as the Colombian Fernando Gaviria and Australia\u2019s Caleb Ewan, fell victim to crashes, punctures or poor positioning. The pattern of the race was set with over 160km to go, such was the ferocity of the 25km cross winds, and a selection of 28 eventually emerged, dominated by the Belgians, who had the Olympic champion Greg Van Avermaet and four others in support of Boonen.</p> <p>A second group included the German trio of Marcel Kittel, Andr\u00e9 Greipel \u2013 who could be seen trying to stay with the leaders and running out of strength \u2013 and John Degenkolb, while the Swiss had also missed out. Their attempts to chase were impeded by two Belgians, who had the luxury of knowing that their team-mates were dominating up ahead, and the frustration which that caused could be seen when Degenkolb had an altercation with the Belgian Jens Debusschere. On the 15km finishing circuit in Doha the chasers\u2019 task became increasingly fruitless.</p> <p>The effort in keeping the group clear eventually told on the Belgians, who peeled off one by one, leaving Boonen with Van Avermaet and J\u00fcrgen Roelandts for company, but they were caught napping by an attack in the final 2km from the Dutchman Tom Leezer and, once he was recaptured, that set up a chaotic sprint where Sagan completed a year in which he has won Classics, including the Tour of Flanders and Gent-Wevelgem, as well as the points jersey in the Tour de France for the fifth time.</p>",

Frey said that although Romney won both constituencies in 2012, President Obama held a slight edge among college-educated white women.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s path to the White House relies heavily on maximizing turnout among non-college-educated white men to deliver wins in the Rust Belt states. </p> <p>He has firmly embraced this constituency, stoking the fires of a working-class revolt with his populist appeal. \u201cWe won with poorly educated,\u201d the Wharton School of business graduate <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpdt7omPoa0\">bragged at a rally</a> after winning the Nevada caucuses. \u201cI love the poorly educated.\u201d</p> <p>But in the process of appealing to this demographic group, Trump has pushed away white voters with a college degree who are more likely to view immigration and global trade \u2013 issues that have animated his campaign \u2013 as positive forces, said Michelle Diggles, a senior policy analyst at Third Way, a liberal thinktank that examined the splintering of white voters.</p> <p>\u201cWhite people with a college degree are much more likely to be optimistic about their own lives,\u201d Diggles said. \u201cThey tend to think they have efficacy, that they\u2019re in control of their own life and that they can successfully or relatively successfully navigate the forces that are transforming our society and economy much better.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.thirdway.org/publishing/attachments/files/000/000/935/December_2015_National_Poll_of_Registered_Voters.pdf?1453831785\">survey</a> conducted by Third Way found that more than half of white voters without a college education believed the economy was rigged. By contrast, nearly half of college-educated white voters said they believed it was not. Similarly, 45% of non-college-educated whites said the deck was stacked against people like them, while only 29% of college-educated white voters agreed with the sentiment.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Diggles added: \u201cWhite people without a college degree are much more likely to see a rigged system, to see the forces of globalization acting against them and they don\u2019t feel like they have control over their own destiny.\u201d</p> <p>Gregory Rosenthal, a retina surgeon and a member of <a href=\"http://www.r4c16.org/\">Republicans for Clinton</a>, is deeply disdainful of Trump\u2019s anti-intellectual appeal to uneducated voters\u2019 fears and anxieties and equally critical of the GOP nominee\u2019s apparent want for complex ideas and speech. <br></p> <p>\u201cTrump is an imbecile like the fictitious Chauncey Gardiner, supported by a rogues\u2019 gallery of cynics hoping to control him,\u201d Rosenthal wrote in an emailed response, making reference to the lead character in the 1979 movie Being There.</p> <p>Rosenthal described his gradual split with the Republican party over its nominee as a \u201cslow motion spiral into a dark hole\u201d and that nothing Trump does at this point could win back his vote.</p> <p> This isn\u2019t the first time he has supported a Democratic nominee, however.
