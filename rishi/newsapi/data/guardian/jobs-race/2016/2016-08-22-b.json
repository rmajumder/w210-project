  "<p>Chi Onwurah, the shadow minister for culture and the digital economy, has suggested Jeremy Corbyn could be guilty of racial discrimination, in the latest attack by a senior Labour MP on his leadership.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/08/labour-mp-any-other-job-jeremy-corbyn-would-have-faced-industrial-tribunal\">an article for the New Statesman</a>, Onwurah claimed that part of her portfolio was handed over to another MP, Thangam Debbonaire, in Corbyn\u2019s contentious January reshuffle, and that \u201cwhen he realised what he had done, he gave the role back to me without telling Thangam\u201d.</p> <p>She added: \u201cJeremy then went on for the next two months refusing my insistence that he speak to Thangam, indeed refusing to speak to either of us, whether directly or through the shadow cabinet, the whips, or his own office. No one knew what he wanted us to do, no one was clear on what we should be doing.\u201d</p> <p>Onwurah, the MP for Newcastle Central, claimed that in any other profession, Corbyn\u2019s approach could have landed him in an employment tribunal.</p> <p>\u201cIf this had been any of my previous employers in the public and private sectors, Jeremy might well have found himself before an industrial tribunal for constructive dismissal, probably with racial discrimination thrown in \u2013 given that only 5% of MPs are black and female, picking on us two is statistically interesting to say the least,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A spokesman for Corbyn said there were negotiations about responsibilities but nobody was sacked, and it was regrettable that Onwurah felt singled out.</p> <p>The MP\u2019s account supported that of Debbonaire, who has previously complained about her treatment at the hands of Corbyn\u2019s team at a time when she was receiving treatment for cancer.</p> <p>Onwurah said she had been working on a campaign against library closures but was unable to launch it formally because no one was sure whether or not libraries were part of her portfolio. She said there was \u201cnothing socialist about incompetence\u201d and Corbyn had no monopoly on objecting to prejudice and injustice in society.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cChi Onwurah\u2019s comments relate to a discussion about the delineation of shadow cabinet roles last January, as is not uncommon in both shadow cabinets and cabinets. Chi was appointed by Jeremy Corbyn to be shadow minister for culture and the digital economy last September,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Thangam Debbonaire was appointed as a dedicated shadow minister for the arts in January, there was a negotiation about the division of responsibilities with Chi and Thangam, but at no point was anyone sacked. We regret that Chi feels she was singled out, but this was clearly not the case.\u201d</p> <p>The MP, who remains on Corbyn\u2019s frontbench, is the latest Labour politician to criticise Corbyn\u2019s leadership style. Last week Heidi Alexander, who resigned as shadow health secretary in June, described Corbyn\u2019s operation as \u201cunprofessional and shoddy\u201d. The former shadow transport secretary Lilian Greenwood has described being \u201cundermined\u201d by the leader. </p> <p>The attacks have annoyed Corbyn supporters who believe he has been unfairly attacked.</p> <p>The leader, who addressed a large rally in London on Sunday night, continues to have the support of most of the major trade unions and the vast majority of constituency Labour parties.<br></p> <p>The latest unrest comes as many Labour MPs turn their minds to what might happen after the leadership contest if \u2013 as the polls suggest \u2013 Corbyn sees off the challenge from Owen Smith.</p> <p>It is understood that the vast majority of MPs agree there should not be a formal split of the party, with many fearing the impact of losing the Labour brand.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely no one is talking about that,\u201d said one MP who is backing Smith. </p> <p>However, they admitted many were split on whether they ought to rally around Corbyn following a victory. One MP who is a critic of the leader said he would be willing to serve on the frontbench again.</p> <p>Others have suggested the possibility of organising separately on the backbenches, in a move that has been described as a \u201csemi-split\u201d. </p> <p>However, the suggestion that the Co-operative party, which has close links to Labour through 25 MPs who have been elected to parliament on a joint ticket, could be used to support a separate grouping has been denied.</p> <p>A spokesperson for party said it had been operating for 99 years to champion the co-operative movement. \u201cWe are not a vehicle to be used by one political faction or another to advance their own agenda. The Co-operative party has worked with Labour under each of its leaders since 1927 and remains neutral on the current leadership contest within the Labour party.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Co-operative party NEC has had no discussions about changing the way the party operates based on the outcome of the Labour leadership contest.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn will face Smith on Thursday in the latest of the party\u2019s hustings events.</p> <p>He remains the clear favourite with the bookies, although Smith will be buoyed after winning the backing of Kezia Dugdale, the leader of Scottish Labour, and Sadiq Khan, the London mayor.</p> <p>Tim Roache, the general secretary of the GMB union, has sent a message to members urging them to back Smith, in a break from other big unions such as Unite and Unison. </p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t spend the next five years as a protest movement, talking to ourselves in a bubble. Now is a time for strength and deeds, not just warm words and slogans,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI encourage you to cast your vote for Owen \u2013 so we can get on with securing a Labour government.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>They wasted a lot of time this season, but boy, the Seattle Sounders are making up for it. Sunday\u2019s Cascadia Cup win over the Portland Timbers means that since firing Sigi Schmid the CenturyLink Field side have drawn one and won three of their four league matches, lifting them into play-off contention in the West. A race that looked to have settled into a rhythm just a few weeks back is now a chaotic hot-mess. Seattle haven\u2019t just lit the fuse, they\u2019ve sparked a raging furnace.<br></p> <p>The 3-1 win over Portland was probably their most satisfying under Brian Schmetzer yet, with the Sounders at their attacking best against their closest rivals. Clint Dempsey has finally found the groove that makes him one of the most potent attackers in the league, but it is the improvement of his supporting cast - and the introduction of Nicolas Lodeiro - that has been most stark.</p> <p>Cristian Roldan, for instance, was outstanding throughout. The 21-year-old looks more suited to the deeper role given to his by Schmertzer in recent weeks, scoring twice, assisting twice and drawing two penalties in the four games he\u2019s played under the interim head coach. Roldan has finally found his identity as a soccer player. It\u2019s not as a playmaker or as a box-to-box operator, but as a space occupier. He fills the areas left by others, and he is just another talent that Schmertzer is now making the most of.</p> <p>So just how far can the Sounders go and how hard can they press for a play-off place, given how late they have left it to make a charge? Their chances could rely on the consistency of their starting lineup. Against Portland, Schmertzer picked the same team for the fourth straight game (the first time since 2010 that Seattle have done that). With the Sounders currently a well-balanced, cohesive, winning side that was to be expected, but what happens when changes have to be made? Will Seattle retain that balance and cohesion? The true depth of their challenge is not yet known.</p> <p>Nonetheless, with the form of the San Jose Earthquakes and the Timbers patchy at present, Seattle\u2019s upward arc could take them all the way into the top six and the play-offs. The Cascadia Cup win over Portland on Sunday proved that their resurgence is for real and not just a fleeting flash of green. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2><strong><br></strong></h2> <h2><strong>Jesse Marsch needs a plan for when things collapse on the road</strong></h2> <p>The New York Red Bulls should have known what to do this time. They\u2019d been there before, after all. Holding a 2-0 lead on the road, on this occasion at East coast rivals DC United, Jesse Marsch\u2019s side looked on course for a statement win. But the Red Bulls know by now not to count their away points until they are on the board. In the end, only one was tallied up after they once again conceded a two-goal lead away from home.</p> <p>It was the same against the Philadelphia Union last month, when a Sacha Kljestan double gave the Red Bulls a 2-0 lead, only for the visitors to PPL Park to capitulate and eventually settle for a 2-2 draw. It happened at StubHub Center too, with the LA Galaxy fighting back from a two-goal deficit to claim a point against an away team all too vulnerable from a winning position. The Chicago Fire also claimed a 2-2 draw against the Harrison side, although they only ever trailed by a single goal.</p> <p>Surely by now Marsch should have a plan to address this critical shortcoming? With Marcelo Sarvas\u2019 penalty kick on Sunday evening, dragging DC United back into the contest at 2-1, the Red Bulls should have resorted to a tactical blueprint designed to limit the damage. Instead they made the same mistakes they have made so many times before. This is more than just misfortune. This is now careless management.</p> <p>Just as in Carson and Chester before that, the Red Bulls were found out at full-back. DC United exploited the space left in behind Kemar Lawrence on the left and Chris Duvall on the right, as Lamar Neagle, Patrick Nyarko and Patrick Mullins exposed the visitors to the Capitol. It\u2019s somewhat astonishing that lessons hadn\u2019t been learned already, but Marsch, as a priority, must ensure his players know how to deal with such a situation when it arises again.</p> <p>Ordinarily, Marsch could put Sunday\u2019s result and the manner of their surrender down to the unpredictability of local rivalries, but this has become a glaring weakness of his team over the past month or two. This deficiency could undermine the Red Bulls\u2019 challenge in the East, certainly hindering their chances of catching New York City FC. Marsch must address it. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2><strong>New York City FC find home comforts</strong></h2> <p>Sometimes, it takes a little while for people to adjust to their new home.<br></p> <p>New York City FC have dealt with that reality for their entire existence \u2013 and opposing fans have relished that fact. From inception, NYC FC have had a tough time traversing the laid-in sod of the Yankee Stadium diamond, the narrow confines of their makeshift home and the depth perception issues common with the sprawling baseball stadium. Last year, those struggles led to an unsightly 6-7-4 record at home.</p> <p>This year, however, Patrick Vieira and his staff have begun to use the baseball ground to their favor. The latest example of this came Saturday evening as NYC FC rode a sixth minute David Villa goal towards an impressive 1-0 win over the LA Galaxy. <br></p> <p>This match was supposed to be about Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard rekindling their vaunted rivalry on the other side of the Atlantic. Instead, it was NYC FC\u2019s stout defensive effort that took center stage, neutralizing the midfield and making two of England\u2019s greatest ever players an afterthought.<br></p> <p>Forget about the fact that Villa\u2019s winner came while he was offside. Instead, focus on the NYC FC defense that, without Maxime Chanot, managed to hold the big-name Galaxy roster to a single shot on goal. Their ability to confound Bruce Arena\u2019s troops resulted in a club record fourth straight victory at home. With that win, NYC FC are just one victory away from tying their 2015 home mark \u2013 with four games yet to be played in the Bronx. </p> <p>Beating the Galaxy and shoring their home form also raises important question: are NYCFC for real? Their current home winning run seems to suggest so, with impressive victories over MLS powers like LA, the New York Red Bulls, Philadelphia Union and the Colorado Rapids.</p> <p>But that streak is only part of the NYC FC revival. Their stellar away form (6-4-3), the leadership of MLS goal scoring leader Villa, their dynamic wing options in Jack Harrison and Tommy McNamara and their reinforced defense also speaks to a larger narrative.<br></p> <p>In short: NYC FC have proven their place amongst the upper echelon of MLS teams. And despite all the setbacks they endured in the nascent days of this franchise, it is now impossible to deny: NYC FC are an MLS Cup contender. And they have earned that distinction. <strong>DM</strong></p> <h2><strong>FC Dallas are paying the price for not signing a top-class striker</strong></h2> <p>Sitting atop the Western Conference, leading the race for the Supporters\u2019 Shield, FC Dallas\u2019 away loss to Real Salt Lake on Saturday was hardly the manifestation of a side on the slide. Yet there were hints at how the Texans\u2019 downfall could happen. Oscar Pareja has forged an astute outfit that could go the distance this season, but he could yet count the cost of his team\u2019s attacking deficiencies.</p> <p>Against RSL, their shortcomings were exposed, succumbing to a goal on the counter-attack having passed several chances of their own. A top-class No9 would surely have taken one of those chances, but FC Dallas don\u2019t have a top-class No9. They have Max Urruti - one of MLS\u2019s most infuriatingly inconsistent forwards - and Getterson - a journeyman on loan from the Brazilian fourth tier. In that respect, they are grossly under-equipped for a tilt at North American soccer\u2019s top prizes.</p> <p>It was a similar story against the Vancouver Whitecaps a week previously, with Urruti spurning a number of chances to secure three points for FC Dallas. The Texans could have been out of sight - or certainly further ahead - at the top of the Western standings were it not for their lack of killer instinct in the final third. Subsequently, Pareja must surely rue not making a move for a dependable striker when the window was open, especially with Fabian Castillo now in Turkey.</p> <p>Of course, FC Dallas could still sign an out-of-contract player, with murmurings that they might have freed up an international spot this week in preparation for a new arrival, but it seems unlikely that Pareja will find the number nine he needs in the free agent market. Truly top-class strikers tend not to be free agents for long, particularly at this time of year.</p> <p>Up until now, FC Dallas have managed to spread the goals across their team. They average 13.1 shots per game, making them MLS\u2019s fourth-most prolific shooters, with their tally of 39 goals for the season so far making them the West\u2019s top scorers. But what happens when goals from midfield and elsewhere dry up, like they did against Real Salt Lake? FC Dallas are hardly renowned as big-spenders, but they might regret not stumping up for a striker good enough to carry them when others can\u2019t. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>An unenviable streak comes to an end</h2> <p>Two years? 110 weeks? 770 days? No matter which unit of time you use, we can all agree that the Chicago Fire waited a long time to break their winless road streak. <br></p> <p>Goals from Luis Solignac, David Accam and Matt Polster propelled the visiting Fire past Didier Drogba\u2019s Montreal Impact 3-0 at Stade Saputo on Saturday evening. It is Chicago\u2019s first road win since 12 July 2014 when they beat the New England Revolution 1-0 at Gilette Stadium.<br></p> <p>Let\u2019s put that stretch into perspective. In the time since Chicago\u2019s last road victory, New York City FC and Orlando City SC entered MLS, and Minnesota United and Los Angeles FC announced their intent to join the league.<br></p> <p>And who remains on the roster from the 2014 Fire? Only Sean Johnson and R\u0103zvan Cocis \u2013 and Cocis wasn\u2019t even there for the last road win. He joined the club two days after that victory, leaving Johnson the lone witness to Chicago \u201chistory\u201d.<br></p> <p>Chicago didn\u2019t just end that drab road form with Saturday\u2019s win. They also snapped a nine-match road losing streak that dates back to 11 May. Their last away point came against New York City FC on April 10th. Since then, they have been outscored 19-7 in their away fixtures, averaging less than a goal per game while being shut out in four of those nine encounters.<br></p> <p>But how MLS is this? The Chicago Fire are still in the playoff hunt. That comes courtesy of the cannibalization of the Eastern Conference. As of Saturday night, the bottom feeding Chicago Fire sit six points away from sixth place Orlando City for the final postseason berth with 11 games to play. Five of their final 11 matches will come on the road against playoff bound NYC FC, DC United and Toronto FC. Cellar dwellers Seattle Sounders and Columbus Crew will also host Chicago. Their remaining home matches are no picnic either, with encounters against the LA Galaxy and Philadelphia Union in the cards.<br></p> <p>Nevertheless, the Fire fans finally have reason to celebrate. Not only did the team win on the road, but they also gifted their followers something they have not enjoyed in a long time: hope.<br></p> <p>Now let\u2019s see how long that lasts. <strong>DM</strong></p>",

Our number of luxurious meals out was sharply reduced. I declared a full moratorium on clothing purchases and other superficial pleasures and concentrated on keeping us within our budget.</p> <p>Then our 17-year-old cat got sick. He\u2019s fine now, but only after 11 vet visits, two procedures with anesthesia and multiple rounds of four different medications. Our touch-and-go financial state had already decimated my savings account. So, out came the credit card.</p> <p>Then my Affordable Care Act healthcare premium spiked to $250 a month \u2013 not so affordable \u2013 and I got sick. I would wake up in the morning doubled over with vomiting and the most intense pain I\u2019ve ever felt radiating from the center of my abdomen. I broke my leg in three places when I was a kid and it was that same kind of hot, explosive bone-break pain, but in my stomach.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/27/student-loan-repayment-default-education\">I defaulted on my student loans.

He told me: \u201cI just want to go home, it is making me worse being here\u201d. </p> <p>I was told later that he had left the department.

  "<p>In the past the unemployment rate was a pretty good measure of the health of the economy. The current rate of 5.7% for much of the past 30 years would have meant the economy was in quite robust health. But over the past decade, the increasing growth of part-time employment means that the gauging the economy\u2019s fitness requires much more than just taking the unemployment pulse rate. </p> <p>Last week <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/6202.0Main+Features1Jul%202016?OpenDocument\">the Australian Bureau of Statistics</a> announced that the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.7% in seasonally adjusted terms. While that big number is always the first thing reported from the labour force figures, for me looking at the actual employment growth is a better indicator of what is going on in the economy. </p> <p>But even here we need to look at what type of employment is growing \u2013 rather than just the big overall number. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jul/18/need-a-full-time-job-move-to-victoria\">Need a full-time job? Move to Victoria | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The monthly employment growth paints a less rosy picture than the 5.7% unemployment rate would suggest. After five months of full-time employment falling, in trend terms the growth of 1,239 people employed full-time saw a 0.02%increase. </p> <p>The big growth was all in part-time employment \u2013 up 10,576 jobs or 0.3%. And yet even this showed a falling off of growth from earlier in the year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Monthly employment growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dOYTV/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It also saw a mere 0.06% increase in the amount of hours worked in July. </p> <p>Hours worked is in many ways the best measure of employment health. Part-time employment can mean anything from one hour a week to 34 hours, and equally full-time employment includes anything from 35 hours and above. Hours worked not only can shows the shift from full-time to part-time it can also detect changes within each category.</p> <p>There is also a strong link between employment growth and the growth in hours worked. </p> <p>At the moment the growth of hours worked is sagging below that of employment. This isn\u2019t too bad if it means employers are either just temporarily reducing hours, or still hiring workers, but just for part-time until things improve. The worry is that the slowing hours worked growth is predicting future slowing employment growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth - employment and hours worked\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Gb7pX/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But the big story of employment at the moment is part-time employment growth and it is not just about that versus full-time work; it is involves gender and age.</p> <p>For most of 2014 and 2015 male full-time employment growth was quite lacklustre while full-time employment growth for women was pretty solid. </p> <p> But this year, full-time jobs have been hard to find for both genders:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Monthly employment growth (trend)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/y4dRe/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>While part-time workers are likely to be women (there are currently 2.6m women working part-time compared to 1.2m men) the big growth in part-time employment in the past few years has been for men.</p> <p>In the past five years the number of men employed part-time has increased by 21.5% compared to an increase of just 1.9% for full-time work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Employment growth by gender\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Z6V38/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The shift of men towards part-time work is one which has been happening now for a quarter of a century. </p> <p>In 1990, 80% of men in the prime working age range of 25 to 64 years were working full-time. Just 3.8% of prime aged men were working part-time. </p> <p>Now only 72.4% of prime aged men work full-time, while 10% are working part-time.</p> <p>There are now fewer men in their prime working age working full-time than ever before. Conversely, there are now more prime-aged women working full-time than ever, and the peak has been steady now for nearly five years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of 25-64 year olds in employment\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mT4fY/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In effect, the story since the GFC has been of male full-time employment shrinking, while part-time work has grown. But for women, part-time work has grown while full-time employment has remained steady.</p> <p>Men working full-time still dominate the labour market. Of all employment, full-time men accounts for 43% alone, but since 2012 there are more women employed in total than there are men in full-time work \u2013 something unthinkable 25 years ago: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Employment by gender\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/30fXJ/3/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But the rise and fall in part-time employment is also about age. </p> <p>Over the past decade the main growth in employment numbers is full-time employment of prime aged workers \u2013 not surprisingly given they are the biggest section of the population. But in the past year there has been a greater increase in actual part-time employment for 25-64 years olds than for full-time, and the same scenario is reflected for youth and for worked over 65 years of age.</p> <p>But when we look at the increase in employed workers as a percentage of the people in each age group the rise in part-time employment becomes obvious:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Change in percentage of people in each age group employed\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/p0dlN/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In the past decade, the percentage of youth working part-time has increased from 28.8% of people aged 15-24 to 31.6%. In the same time the percentage of youth working full-time has fallen from 35.4% to just 27.2%. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of youth employed (ages 15-24)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1T0Lq/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But while full-time work has evaporated for the youth, older workers have been staying in the workforce in much greater numbers \u2013 both in full-time and very much so in part-time.</p> <p>At the start of this century just 3% of those over 65 were working part-time, but now 7.3% of those supposedly in the retirement age are working part-time:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of people over 65 years of age employed\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3wUfV/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Now part-time work often gets a bad rap, when in reality it is not always bad \u2013 it can be a first start for many workers and can be necessary when raising a child. For those over the age of 65 the reasons for work are less obvious \u2013 either out of need, or because better health allows more people to stay working. </p> <p>Certainly since 2004 there has been a steady increase in the numbers of older workers. </p> <p>But with the increase in part-time employment across the board has also come an increase in underemployment:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Underemployment ratio\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zbLbj/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The underemployment rate across all age groups is much higher now than it was in 2003 when the unemployment rate was much the same as it is now. </p> <p>The shift towards part-time employment over the past decade means more than in the past we need to look at much more than just the unemployment rate to gauge the health of the labour market. </p> <p>At the moment while the unemployment rate remains well below 6%, the weakness in the growth of full-time employment and hours worked suggests the labour market is a long way from peak fitness. </p>"
