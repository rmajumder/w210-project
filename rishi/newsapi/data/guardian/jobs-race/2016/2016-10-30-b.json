  "<p>Conservative council leaders are warning they face a \u00a3600m black hole in budgets to improve struggling schools after the government last week pulled the plug on its education bill.</p> <p>With council budgets already under severe pressure after years of austerity, some say they may need maintained schools to contribute from their own shrinking budgets, while others may be forced to cut support services they provide to local schools, leaving them vulnerable to decline.</p> <p>The threat to school improvement services comes as Ofsted\u2019s chief inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, described England\u2019s schools as \u201cmediocre but getting better\u201d, giving the education system a rating of \u201c6.5 out of 10\u201d.</p> <p>Local authorities \u2013 including Conservative-run county councils in Kent, Hampshire and Buckinghamshire \u2013 say they have been left in limbo by the government\u2019s axing of educational services grants worth \u00a3600m ahead of passing the bill that would have curtailed the role of local authorities in maintaining community schools in England.</p> <p>But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/29/what-does-dropping-of-education-bill-mean\">demise, announced to parliament by education secretary Justine Greening last Thursday, of the education for all bill</a>, means councils will still be legally required to run school improvement services next year and meet other costs, such as maternity cover for teachers, but without funding from central government.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/27/government-drops-education-bill-after-series-of-reversals\">Education bill scrapped after series of reversals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Martin Tett, the Conservative leader of Buckinghamshire county council, condemned the government\u2019s failure to coordinate its funding and support for the many state schools that have not become academies.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we now have is a situation where the grant is being removed but the responsibilities will remain, particularly the statutory responsibility with regard to school improvement. And councils at the moment \u2013 particularly upper-tier councils, like county councils \u2013 are very financially stretched,\u201d Tett said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a massive issue for us, because we have an important role in school improvement \u2013 not only supporting schools that require improvement or are in special measures, but actually stopping schools from reaching that stage in first place, by intervening early in a preventative approach.That costs money and, at the moment, that money is disappearing.\u201d</p> <p>The cuts will affect the bulk of the more than 20,000 state schools in England which are still maintained by their local authorities, rather than the fewer than 5,000 academies which are funded directly by central government.</p> <p>Research by the County Councils Network \u2013 representing 37 unitary authorities and county councils \u2013 has found that more than two-thirds of academies choose to purchase school improvement services from their local authority, meaning that academies also rely on council support in many places.</p> <p>Paul Carter, the Conservative leader of Kent council, said his county would be losing \u00a34.5m in school support services when the grant was withdrawn next year. \u201cLocal government is having the most challenging time under public expenditure restraints and \u00a34.5m, even for a local authority the size of Kent, is another mountain to climb,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe have made a very strong case to government that the money needs to be put back in the jar, because the impact on schools improvement will be disproportionate, especially in primary schools, which are really quite brittle and rely on the support of good local authorities.</p> <p>\u201cIn Kent, our proportion of primary schools that are good or outstanding is above the national average but, if you go back 10 years ago, that wasn\u2019t the case. It\u2019s because of a sustained campaign to help and support primary schools improve, which they have done. It\u2019s a great success story.\u201d</p> <p>If the grant was not renewed, Carter said the council was looking at a plan to meet the costs by asking maintained schools for more than \u00a32m, intensifying the squeeze on school budgets whose own income has been frozen.</p> <p>In Buckinghamshire, Tett says there are \u201cno spare millions\u201d to support schools.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is that all local councils are so financial stretched at the moment. The idea of effectively subsidising the education services grant from roads or pavements or other maintenance budgets is just not going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t; we don\u2019t have any spare money in our budget at all. </p> <p>\u201cThe government has to, in my view, either remove the statutory responsibilities or restore the funding. It can\u2019t leave us in limbo, where we have responsibility but no money. The obviously better outcome, in terms of schools and children, is that government restores the funding.\u201d</p> <p>The council leaders\u2019 fears chime with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b081wrqg/the-andrew-marr-show-30102016\">comments made by Wilshaw</a> on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, in which he said that the English school system was \u201cin intensive care in the 70s, 80s and much of the 90s\u201d. </p> <p>But reforms since then \u201chave made a big difference; we\u2019ve got a much better education system now\u201d, Wilshaw said. \u201cThe big \u2018but\u2019 is that we\u2019re not there yet; we\u2019re not with the best jurisdictions in the world. We\u2019re not there with the South Koreas and the Shanghais and some of the really good European nations. We\u2019ve got a lot to do to catch up.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/30/grammars-harm-british-schools-says-ofsted-chief-michael-wilshaw\">New grammars would harm British schools, says Ofsted chief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wilshaw, who steps down as chief inspector of schools in England at the end of the year, repeated his view that opening new grammar schools would hinder further improvements.</p> <p>\u201cIf you have grammar schools, you take away the most able children from the all-ability comprehensive set-up. And I speak as an ex-head of a successful inner-city comprehensive school, an academy, in Hackney. I needed those top 20% to lift everyone up,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Wilshaw added that tackling regional underperformance and reforming skills education were more urgent tasks than opening new grammar schools.<br></p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Education said more pupils were now in good or outstanding schools than previously, but that more needed to be done.<br><br>\u201cWe will scrap the ban on new grammar schools and allow them to open where parents want them \u2013 with strict conditions to make sure they improve the education of pupils in other schools locally,\u201d the DfE said.<br></p> <p>A new report funded by Knowsley council \u2013 which has the lowest GCSE results of any authority in the country \u2013 argues that its region requires a \u201cnorthern teaching premium\u201d to attract more qualified staff, including incentives such as paying off teachers\u2019 student debts, higher wages, subsidised housing and greater opportunities for professional development. <br></p>",

And with a nightly audience of 1.5 million, he has found a distinctive political voice.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Trump came down the escalator to announce his candidacy we thought we\u2019d get two weeks of material of it,\u201d Meyers said this week before taping a new show partially devoted to Republican preoccupations with sex. \u201cWe thought he\u2019d tease and get the kind of attention from saying he might run. </p> <p>\u201cBut we never thought he\u2019d go through with it.\u201d<br></p> <p>What started as material for comedy soon transformed into something else entirely.</p> <p>\u201cWith each of [Trump\u2019s] successes,\u201d Meyers said, \u201cthere\u2019s been a stock-taking of how different this felt from any election that\u2019s come before it. It\u2019s been a gift, but a gift that wears on you. Whenever we have a hiatus week, part of what makes it relaxing is to get away from this.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, with 11 days to go, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/fury-fbi-director-cryptic-letter-clinton-emails-response\">the campaign was thrown into turmoil</a> by the latest turn in the drama over Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. That took the spotlight away from Trump \u2013 most likely, momentarily.</p> <p>\u201cI think he found an audience and then cultivated what that audience wanted,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cI think audience reaction is what he\u2019s most concerned with.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s the kind of observation a performer would make. \u201cHe has a very good antenna for it,\u201d Meyers continued. \u201cHe loves playing the big room \u2013 those 20,000 seat arenas \u2013 and that\u2019s why he can\u2019t be bothered to show up to most interviews. He\u2019d rather phone it in.\u201d</p> <p>Some have suggested that however much Trump protests that he wants to be president, in a sense he knows he is not the man for the job. He may be vain and thin-skinned, but that doesn\u2019t quite account for the self-destructive fights he picks. Meyers believes the reality may be that Trump sees himself as a reluctant saviour.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018If only he\u2019d run, he\u2019d be the solution to all our problems\u2019 is a lot more fun than actually having to solve those problems,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t shied away from using words like \u2018racist\u2019 and \u2018liar\u2019, but our theory is that this got out of hand for him. </p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t think he\u2019d get this far, but I think he knows he\u2019d hate the job.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past 18 months, the conventional wisdom about what a candidate can or cannot do has been thoroughly overturned. </p> <p>\u201cWe were told an outside candidate couldn\u2019t upset the apple cart of what the GOP is,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cBut with each outrage, people have said they\u2019d leave, thinking other people would follow them, but no one did.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Km4R377s4M\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0Km4R377s4M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Seth Meyers speaks at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner in 2011.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Before he took the Late Night job two and a half years ago, as a speaker at the 2011 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Km4R377s4M\">White House Corres</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Km4R377s4M\">pondents\u2019 Association Dinner</a>, Meyers memorably asked whether Trump was planning to run as a Republican or as a joke.</p> <p>That was in the midst of the Trump\u2019s \u201cbirther campaign\u201d against Barack Obama, and Obama had already made fun of the businessman. Footage clearly shows Trump sitting stony faced as he endures Meyers\u2019 comedic attention. Some believe such ritualised humiliation steeled Trump to run.</p> <p>\u201cMy worry was that the president had gone first and already told a lot of jokes about him and there would be audience exhaustion,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cTurned out people were happy to hear more jokes about him, but the first thing I heard when I stepped off the stage was to steer clear of him at the parties.\u201d</p> <p>The next day, Trump started criticising Meyers and his performance. </p> <p>\u201cWhen you talk about a gift,\u201d Meyers said, \u201cthat\u2019s the gift that keeps giving. He\u2019s so transparent in his inability to take the high road and that\u2019s the scariest thing about him \u2013 how deep-seated his resentments are.\u201d</p> <p>But has the rich seam of Trump comedic material let his opponent off lightly? </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s comical but it\u2019s harder to explain,\u201d Meyers says about Clinton\u2019s emails, controversy over her family foundation and the WikiLeaks release of hacked Democratic party emails. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve tried. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/12/seth-meyers-donald-trump-blowhard-us-election\">Seth Meyers mocks Trump: 'A blowhard with a seventh-grade vocabulary'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe bigger problem we have, though, is there have been so few days when what\u2019s happening on the Clinton side has been a better story than what\u2019s happening on the Trump side.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to be fair, but we don\u2019t feel that being fair is an equal number of jokes on each candidate. That\u2019s a false equivalency. For us, it\u2019s about chasing the best story for jokes and it\u2019s rare that she\u2019s a better joke than him.\u201d</p> <p>The now infamous 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which Trump is heard to brag about his ability to kiss and touch women without their consent emerged from NBC. The network has not escaped accusations of political bias. But as Meyers pointed out in a segment to camera last week, many of the Republican party\u2019s own problems appear to stem from living within a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkSm1Pgyy7w\">bubble of highly partisan media information.</a></p> <p>In 10 days, after election day, the banquet of political comedy will have been consumed. Will Meyers feel bereft? Or over-indulged and suffering indigestion? Meyers recalls his time at Saturday Night Live, when the cool draft of post-election comedown could be felt ahead of the vote. In this cycle, however, it\u2019s not clear what will come next.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know we wanted to take it here so I wouldn\u2019t want to predict where we\u2019d take it next,\u201d he says. \u201cDonald Trump seems to be saying he thinks the election will have a long tail. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if the first 100 days of the next presidency will be about the defeated candidate still making a lot of noise.\u201d</p>",
