  "<p>A new academic study has found \u201ca pattern of discrimination\u201d against passengers with African American-sounding names by Uber and Lyft drivers.</p> <p>The findings call into question a <a href=\"https://medium.com/matter/ubering-while-black-146db581b9db#.yle9nmpsl\">central narrative</a> of ride-hail apps that they solve the entrenched and humiliating problem of hailing a cab for black passengers. </p> <p>Waiting times for black passengers in Seattle were 35% longer than for white passengers, and drivers in Boston cancelled rides for black passengers more than twice as frequently as for white passengers, researchers found in a <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w22776?utm_campaign=ntw&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntw\">study</a> published Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research. </p> <p>In order to study the issue, researchers designed randomized trials by sending research assistants on nearly 1,500 rides in Seattle and Boston. </p> <p>\u201cIs a taxi driver\u2019s decision, made in public view, not to stop for an African American passenger being eliminated?

  "<h2>1. Professional punters do not go near the Cup</h2> <p>The 156th running of \u201cthe race that stops a nation\u201d, a national day of punting and good cheer, and one of the great fun days on the Australian punt-drinking calendar, is upon us. And just about every one of us will gamble upon the race, with estimates that upwards of $800m will be spent, which is rather a lot when you sit down to think about it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/31/short-but-good-no-rain-on-melbourne-cups-parade\">'Short but good': no rain on Melbourne Cup's parade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet professional punters \u2013 those gamblers who represent less than 1% of all gamblers because they actually \u201cwin\u201d betting on horses \u2013 won\u2019t go near the Cup. There are too many horses (24) in the race, too many variables, too much \u201cform\u201d both here and overseas which could mean anything. And too many of the horses are very good because they come from everywhere to run, in part down to the prestige of the race, but also due to the pot of $6.2m that is up for grabs. </p> <h2>2. Racing is not always romantic</h2> <p>Jockey Michelle Payne won the race last year aboard the 100-1 outsider Prince of Penzance, the first woman in history to win the Melbourne Cup. And she was everywhere, the \u201cyou-go-girl\u201d of Australian sport. Twelve months down the track, there is one woman riding in the 24-horse field, Katelyn Mallyon aboard a 50-1 shot, Assign. Payne doesn\u2019t have a ride this year for a variety of reasons, not all sexist though.</p> <p></p> <p> Last year Payne had barely hopped off her mount before she criticised some of the horse\u2019s owners because they didn\u2019t want to give her the ride. She sledged these people, effectively her employers, publicly, on national television, using the stage of Flemington on Cup day to vent her spleen. And whatever the merits of her argument \u2013 and there were many \u2013 Payne will watch from wherever she watches in part because of that.</p> <p>Nor will Prince of Penzance defend the title because he injured a leg early October. It\u2019s not always a romantic game, thoroughbred horse racing. </p> <h2>3. The Sheikh\u2019s year?</h2> <p>On the website of the all-powerful Godolphin Stables it says his highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum founded the company \u201cas an expression of his lifelong passion for horses and racing\u201d, which would be true. It certainly wouldn\u2019t be for money. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>He\u2019s the Emir of Dubai and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and would have more money than everyone combined at Flemington on Tuesday. And yet, despite his vast wealth, the Sheikh has never won the Melbourne Cup. He wants to so badly that he has five runners in this year\u2019s race, all which will trot out in the famous royal blue of Godolphin.</p> <p>That elusive win may not be far away. Hartnell has one of Australia\u2019s best jockeys in James McDonald, came second to super-horse Winx in the recent WS Cox Plate (a race turf experts say is a better marker to the Melbourne Cup than the likes of other \u201cstaying\u201d races like the Caulfield Cup), and has won at the distance at Ascot in England where staying races are valued more than here.</p> <p>The Cup\u2019s second-favourite is Oceanographer who won the Lexus Stakes (over 2,500m) and placed third in the recent Geelong Cup (3,200m) which was won by Qewy, who is also owned, of course, by the Sheikh. </p> <p>His other chances include Beautiful Romance (70-1) and Secret Number (33-1), both of whom have been fed the finest oats and pampered like horse-princelings, and could yet make this the Sheikh\u2019s year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/31/latest-edition-of-melbourne-cup-set-fair-to-build-on-last-years-publicity-coup\">Latest edition of Melbourne Cup set to build on last year\u2019s publicity coup | Michael Hutak</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>4. Nobody really knows who will win</h2> <p>Every tip from every \u201cexpert\u201d in the land counts for nothing, and Prince of Penzance can win at 100-1 like he did last year with a form line and breeding that would put it in the category of \u201cswamp donkey\u201d against the elite blue-blooded horses bred by Godolphin. </p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t usually happen. In fact 100-1 shots would win races far less than one in a hundred times. So if you\u2019re studying form and trying to pick a winner from your newspaper\u2019s form guide, try to fossick about and find horses that have been successful over the distance (3,200 metres) or thereabouts. Indeed any success from 2,000m to 3,200m and above is staying form. </p> <p>Oceanographer is one that fits the bill. A last-start winner, super impressive in both the Geelong Cup and in winning the Lexus, he\u2019s low weight, which is a real bonus for Europeans, and the forecast of rain may also suit him. He should, however, be wary of Almandin, because in-form jockey Kerrin McEvoy hopped off Oceanographer to ride him.</p> <p>Clearly the best local chance is Hartnell. He has been set for the Melbourne Cup and the Cox Plate was just a warmup. Winx beat him soundly but that was Winx\u2019s grand final while Hartnell is set for a longer trip. He still beat a bunch of quality horses in the Cox Plate by some distance. He represents a bit of a risk at the 3,200m based on last year\u2019s performance (in the same race) but he\u2019s in much better form now than last year \u2013 and doesn\u2019t have to race Winx again.</p> <h2>5. Gambling is a mug\u2019s game</h2> <p>Australians will bet an estimated $800m on this year\u2019s Melbourne Cup, which represents 3.5% of the $23bn Australians spend on gambling per annum. Yes, $23bn, which works out at about $1,000 per man, woman and child. It seems quite a lot. And one might think that one day there may come a reckoning for the country\u2019s greater social good given the flow of revenue from poor people (gamblers) to rich people (bookmakers), just as there is on a micro level for hundreds of thousands of families that lose houses, cars, each other, because of addiction to the punt.</p> <p>And therein lies a cautionary tale: if you \u201cwin\u201d today you will feel euphoria. You will feel like Homer Simpson in his dream about life after robbing the Quik-E-Mart, with Marge in a bikini doing a go-go dance and Homer sucking on a cigar in a rocking chair on the steps of a giant white house.</p> <p>But there is one certainty about a life \u201con the punt\u201d and it is this: <em>you will lose</em>. Money will flow from your wallet or virtual account into whatever electronic contraption is owned by the corporate bookmaker, a super-smart computing machine running algorithms with one sole purpose in life: to fleece you of your money. </p>",

Our Mayan heroine Mar\u00eda is set for a local arranged marriage, but yearns to run away with another man, Pepe, for a new life in the United States. She is torn: \u201cWhat else is there?\u201d in the US, she asks Pepe. \u201cMoney. Dollars,\u201d he replies while the camera remains on Mar\u00eda\u2019s face. \u201cWhat does the air smell like there?\u201d He doesn\u2019t know. \u201cHere, the air smells of coffee.

  "<h2>1) Vettel brings the noise</h2> <p>Radio Sebastian Vettel is becoming something that should be confined to a post-watershed time slot. His increasingly erratic and expletive-laden messages are upsetting people in much the same way that the late, great John Peel did when he brought punk to the airwaves in 1976. Red Bull\u2019s Helmut Marko, with whom Vettel had been very close during his championship-winning years at Red Bull, was certainly unimpressed. \u201cThe situation is unworthy of a four-time world champion,\u201d he said. \u201cHis choice of words certainly wasn\u2019t first-class.\u201d</p> <p>Many will have been offended and his decision to send a message to the race director, Charlie Whiting, to \u201cfuck off\u201d was absolutely uncalled for, especially given Whiting\u2019s dedication and long-term commitment to the sport, not to mention his skill and professionalism that is admired across the paddock.</p> <p>But equally Vettel\u2019s exasperated missives from the cockpit are without doubt entertaining. Modern drivers are routinely criticised for being PR-trained automata, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/30/lewis-hamilton-formula-one-emerson-fittipaldi\" title=\"\">indeed Emerson Fittipaldi praised Lewis Hamilton this weekend</a> for being one of the few to show real personality, so should Vettel really take so much flak for being human? Had he reacted entirely calmly after Max Verstappen failed to give back the place Vettel believed he had earned, it would have been exceptionally unemotional and hugely dull.</p> <p>Vettel is clearly frustrated at the position Ferrari are in, with no wins this season, no advance towards Mercedes and third in the constructors\u2019 championship to Red Bull. But he is also a grown-up and, as Christian Horner noted, if you miked up footballers the results would doubtless put Vettel\u2019s outbursts in the shade. If there is real concern his language is corrupting the nation\u2019s kids \u2013 as many thought Peel spinning the Damned and the Pistols was \u2013 then FOM need not broadcast them. But the show would be poorer for it.</p> <h2>2) Confusion rules over cutting corners</h2> <p>Lewis Hamilton, suffering with glazed brake discs from the formation lap, locked up on entering turn one and cut the corner to maintain his lead from pole but escaped censure. Verstappen cut the same corner while Vettel was attempting to pass and took a five-second penalty that cost him his podium spot.</p> <p>That there appeared to be a double standard caused considerable debate and plenty of vexatious remarks from drivers. Verstappen and his Red Bull team-mate, Daniel Ricciardo, were extremely vocal post-race in criticising the lack of sanction against Hamilton and it certainly will have made little sense to casual fans of the sport. In fact the stewards did look at the incident involving the British driver. They concluded he had not gained any lasting advantage from cutting the corner and looked at telemetry that showed he had in fact backed off immediately afterwards. That Nico Rosberg was some way back and tussling with Verstappen through the corner would have been a factor, as was the deployment of the safety car shortly afterwards which brought the cars together again.</p> <p>In contrast Verstappen was adjudged to have maintained his place ahead of Vettel only by cutting the corner and hence was punished. He, with his usual enthusiasm, vehemently denied that Vettel had got ahead, but the stewards examined all the data and angles and will have been in a better position to make that call than the driver.</p> <p>None of which makes it necessarily clearer to viewers just tuning in for the race on a Sunday but it does highlight the issue that going off should carry some forfeit. Again here perhaps the return of some form of gravel trap, an imposition to speed and the state of the tyres, would be useful, or indeed raised curb chicanes that force the driver to slow before rejoining would be worth investigation. If Hamilton had faced some form of obvious impairment for going off, the question of an official penalty would not have needed to be raised.</p> <h2>3) Ecclestone\u2019s plan highlights a real problem</h2> <p>Hamilton\u2019s off-track excursion had been to an extent pre-empted by Bernie Ecclestone, increasingly sounding like almost a fringe group of one in F1, even before the race weekend began. He had suggested that 40cm-high walls on the corners would increase the danger and the excitement of the sport and was almost universally panned.</p> <p>Rosberg, who had already given short shrift to another Ecclestone comment that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/27/nico-rosberg-bernie-ecclestone-jibes-f1-title-mexican-gp\" title=\"\">his taking the title would not help the sport</a>, had even less time for this idea. \u201cThere are 10 other areas which we should look at, if we want to make the sport even better than it is, before we start looking at turning back time on safety,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Various other drivers agreed and Jenson Button, a director of the Grand Prix Drivers\u2019 Association, was pithy. \u201cIt would be good for advertising in the sport \u2013 the sponsors,\u201d he said drily, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a pointless comment to comment on.\u201d But he and Daniel Ricciardo did acknowledge that it had raised an issue that really must be dealt with \u2013 staying within track limits.</p> <p>Currently the rules vary from circuit to circuit as does their enforcement and of course drivers exploit them everywhere to take advantage. The FIA World Endurance Championship race director, Eduardo Freitas, makes track limits clear before every meeting and rigidly enforces them with warnings and then penalties during races. A technique which would at least be a good place to start.</p> <h2>4) F1 belongs in Mexico</h2> <p>The numbers at the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez were huge in 2015 \u2013 134,850 \u2013 second only to Silverstone and this year they were even better with 135,026 fans packing the circuit in Mexico City. Interest was expected to be high after absence from the calendar for 23 years but bucking the traditional drop-off in year two is an extraordinary achievement.</p> <p>There are two factors at work here. The first is fairly straightforward \u2013 Mexico loves F1. There is a motor racing heritage here \u2013 38,000 attended the WEC race in September \u2013 but a long-standing, deep-seated passion for Formula One in particular. It was clearly evident from Friday practice when swarms of fans, bedecked in team merchandise, arrived before any cars had gone out and filled the circuit to a level that many tracks would gladly take on a Sunday.</p> <p>Trackside in the stadium section during FP2, to hear the roar every time Sergio P\u00e9rez and Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez went past was an absolute pleasure and their presence certainly helps, but it is really further evidence that taking the sport to a decent track (which it still is, even post-Herman Tilke remodelling), where there is genuine passion for the sport, does work.</p> <p>It has also been promoted exceptionally well. \u201cJoin the \u2018F1esta\u2019,\u201d proclaimed the posters that were spread blanket-like all over town. The city\u2019s myriad underpasses hosted huge, long pictures of a sequence of cars and, as one drove through them, it triggered speakers blaring out engine sounds \u2013 which was innovative and a sure-fire way to stir the heart of fans. A public-private partnership, the organisers have tried to price tickets to take account of local incomes and not just sat back and waited for them to buy.</p> <p>A full track promotes the city better than a half-empty one and makes the TV coverage all the more spectacular.

It is a record he will not take pleasure in but one that Mexico proved again surely cannot last.</p> <p>He will join Renault, a works team, next year and they will expect to be vastly more competitive than this season. Now they have had the manufacturers\u2019 full backing this year in developing 2017\u2019s car, their engine should also make a further step forward \u2013 it is already performing well in a car with a good chassis as Red Bull finish the season second only to Mercedes. They will expect much from H\u00fclkenberg and he showed it at the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez.</p> <p>He qualified exceptionally strongly in fifth ahead of the two Ferraris, only two-tenths of a second back from the fourth-placed Red Bull of Ricciardo and a full seven spots ahead of his team-mate Sergio P\u00e9rez, who was in identical machinery. His race was equally impressive, even given his spin while battling Kimi Raikkonen and seventh, the first place outside the big six, even after the musical chairs of the stewards had been completed, was another strong run \u2013 and three ahead of P\u00e9rez.</p> <p>It was crucial for his team as well; with the two Williams finishing in eighth and ninth, these were vital points to keep Force India nine ahead of the Grove-based squad in the battle for fourth in the constructors\u2019 championship. Renault will expect similar, while the Hulk will be happy with a car that can help him achieve that elusive podium finish.</p>",

He was also due to speak in Warren in Michigan on Monday before appearing with running mate Mike Pence in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, on Tuesday.</p> <p>Until his polling gap began to narrow again last week, Trump had been forced back to a dwindling number of swing states, while Clinton eyed Republican territory in Utah, Arizona and Georgia. Renewed optimism among Republicans has created an unusually vast national battleground, particularly as Trump\u2019s economic populism scrambles traditional demographic dividing lines. </p> <p>Michigan and Wisconsin have both been hit hard by the loss of manufacturing jobs and were the scene of surprise defeats for Clinton in the Democratic primary, when large numbers of blue-collar workers favoured Bernie Sanders. Signs of Democratic nervousness in Wisconsin became apparent last week when the Clinton campaign suddenly announced an advertising blitz. Sanders has been dispatched to help campaign for Clinton in the state on Wednesday.</p> <p>The impact of early voting may also be forcing Trump to look further afield. States such as a North Carolina have seen heavy early turnout among Democrats and may be relatively immune from any late swing away from Clinton.</p> <p>If he cannot win North Carolina but picks up Florida and Ohio, Trump\u2019s best hope of pulling off a shock victory will rely on either rustbelt states like Michigan and Wisconsin or, in the north-east, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Maine.</p> <p>Clinton is redoubling her efforts.

Such programs stress \u201cthe importance of explicit pathways to real jobs for people who are, or believe they are, excluded from the workforce\u201d and that it requires \u201ca commitment from employers and from potential employees\u201d.</p> <p>This approach could work under the government\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/sep/22/christian-porters-welfare-figures-are-designed-to-shock-pay-them-no-respect\">investment approach</a>\u201d to welfare, which seeks to focus on at-risk groups within the community.</p> <p>But the snapshot highlights the futility of government policy such as waiting periods until being able to access Newstart. It also shows that while work-for-the-dole programs may give the government a nice feeling that the dole isn\u2019t being given for nothing, it is not a solution to entrenched unemployment for low-skilled workers.</p>",

  "<p>White Square Fine Books &amp; Art is nestled in the town of Easthampton, Mass., deep in the heart of the Pioneer Valley. Eileen Corbeil and her husband purchased a beautiful old building at 86 Cottage Street in April 2010, and spent nine months renovating the space, opening the store in December 2010. The name White Square is borrowed from La Place Blanche, one of the small plazas along the Boulevard de Clichy in Paris, where, in the early 1900s, clouds of chalky dust were churned up by carts carrying plaster of Paris and where Degas, Picasso and other artists lived and worked.</p> <p><strong>Why did you open a bookstore in the Pioneer Valley? </strong></p> <p><em>Eileen: </em>We needed a place to shelve and organize the thousands of books that filled our home and were making the floor joists sag! Though we also hoped to encourage reading and a love for books, and add a literary dimension to our artistic and musical hometown.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your favorite section in the store</strong>?</p> <p>No easy answer since I love stocking the shelves and working the counter, greeting regulars or meeting new people, especially children. Perhaps because it happens too infrequently, I love working quietly in the basement where our rare and collectible books are housed and where I can (without interruption) do research on inscriptions, signatures, first editions, etc.</p> <p><strong>If you had infinite space what would you add?</strong></p> <p>I would expand in three areas: (1) more and better space to display rare books and host interesting exhibitions; (2) more and better space for children, including a welcoming and fun event space; and (3) space to offer the occasional high tea like you might find in Cornwall and Devon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5283a0d60810bcf54df7450e4ea58c0503a50d2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5283a0d60810bcf54df7450e4ea58c0503a50d2d/53_0_1133_680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"White Square Books\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What do you do better than any other bookstore</strong>?</p> <p>We do great events with authors and artists. At our annual Bloomsday lunch we\u2019ll read and discuss a portion of <em>Ulysses</em> and enjoy a light Leopold Bloom-type lunch. We sponsored Easthampton\u2019s first Book Festival in April on a shoestring budget and attracted more than 1,000 people to the 20 or so events. Plus, I have a knack for finding cool and collectible items of interest to bibliophiles (see the <a href=\"http://www.whitesquarebooks.com/#!catalog/c1bl1\">Americana catalog</a>).</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the oddest situation you\u2019ve ever had to deal with in the store?</strong></p> <p>Customers (and their dogs) have always been great!</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your earliest/best memory about visiting a bookstore as a child?</strong></p> <p>I grew up in rural Vermont where there were no bookstores. We relied on the regional lending library, which deposited books in our neighbor Stella\u2019s dining room once a month. I adored choosing and checking out books, especially because Stella was a great cook and usually offered me a homemade donut.</p> <p><strong>If you weren\u2019t running/working at a bookstore what would you be doing?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019d still be working in a senior management position in higher education. And wishing I were running a bookstore\u2026</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s been the biggest surprise about running a bookstore?</strong></p> <p>I opened the bookstore because it seemed like it would be fun for <em>me</em> (and it is). But I\u2019ve learned that bookstores are integral to the intellectual life of a community, and filling this need (and being able to sustain the effort) has been incredibly rewarding.</p> <h2>The staff shelf</h2> <p><strong>What is Eileen reading?</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7d25d92ae4821afa1d7be312045da9e4eae37541\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d25d92ae4821afa1d7be312045da9e4eae37541/0_0_308_500/308.jpg\" alt=\"The Hill Bachelors\" width=\"308\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/28/fiction.reviews\">The Hill Bachelors by William Trevor</a> (2000). </strong>\u201cMy favorite piece of writing by William Trevor is The Hill Bachelors, one of a dozen stories in the collection of the same name.

  "<p>The cross-country race scheduled for Cheltenham a week on Friday is at risk because of the unusually dry autumn.

That part of the racecourse still has good to firm places after regular irrigation over the past two months, amounting to more than eight inches in all.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m told there is the possibility of some rainfall this Sunday and Monday,\u201d Claisse said, \u201cbut that is also what we were told last Monday and that rain petered out by the end of the week. We will be putting on 5mm or 6mm [on the Old Course] this week because it will be too late, by the beginning of next week, to do anything if that rain doesn\u2019t come.</p> <p>\u201cThe forecast rain will keep the chase and hurdles tracks in very good nick. The cross-country would need considerably more and we will have to give consideration, next week, to the question of whether we can provide safe ground for that race.</p> <p>\u201cThe cross-country course is currently firm, hard in places. If we have to continue to water the Old Course, we won\u2019t have any chance of getting the cross-country back to good to firm.\u201d</p> <p>Claisse pointed out that this autumn, while unusually dry, is not unique. In 2003, the ground was too fast to stage races on the cross-country track in November and again in December, when the rest of the racecourse was still being irrigated a fortnight before Christmas.</p> <p>Claisse added that Cheltenham will work with the BHA to arrange an alternative race for cross-country-type horses, which could be run if the cross-country cannot take place. In 2003, that took the form of a four-mile handicap chase for horses rated up to 135.</p> <p>Entries for the alternative race will be taken at the same time as those for the rest of the card, though a final decision about whether it will be needed will not be made until next week.</p>",
