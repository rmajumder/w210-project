  "<p>A war of words has erupted between groups affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement and pro-Israel commentators over the characterization of Israel in their policy document released last week.</p> <p>The policy <a href=\"https://policy.m4bl.org/platform/\">platform</a> titled A Vision for Black Lives, is a wide-spanning document that was <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/movement-black-lives-platform/494309/\">drafted by</a> more than 50 organizations known as the Movement for Black Lives. It goes beyond criminal justice and touches on many issues including education and economics.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"https://policy.m4bl.org/invest-divest/\">Invest/Divest</a> section of the platform, the group criticizes the US government for providing military aid to Israel.</p> <p>\u201cThe US justifies and advances the global war on terror via its alliance with Israel and is complicit in the genocide taking place against the Palestinian people,\u201d the platform says. \u201cIsrael is an apartheid state with over 50 laws on the books that sanction discrimination against the Palestinian people.\u201d</p> <p>This characterization drew ire from pro-Israel commentators, and in the week since its release many have penned op-eds and statements condemning the movement.</p> <p>On his personal <a href=\"https://medium.com/@J0NATHAN_G/eyes-on-the-prize-in-pursuit-of-racial-justice-stick-to-the-facts-and-avoid-the-fiction-5a5486a5cb4e#.tm67on7ma\">Medium</a> page, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League Jonathan Greenblatt wrote that, while he agreed with the majority of the document, he called the treatment of Israel \u201cone-sided\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe categorically reject the document\u2019s criticism of the United States and Israel,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s repellent and completely inaccurate to label Israel\u2019s policy as \u2018genocide\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Other groups such as the <a href=\"http://truah.org/5-media/general/779-t-ruah-statement-on-black-lives-matter-platform.html\">T\u2019ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.jcrcboston.org/jcrc-statement-regarding-black-lives-matter-platform/\">Boston chapter of the Jewish Community Relations Council</a> expressed \u201cdismay\u201d over the platform. The JCRC said it could no longer support Black Lives Matter and while T\u2019ruah said it will \u201cinsist on standing up for the dignity and safety of both Israelis and Palestinians\u201d.</p> <p>Dream Defenders, one of the groups that wrote the Invest/Divest section, wrote a <a href=\"http://www.dreamdefenders.org/dream_defenders_statement_on_the_condemnation_of_m4bl_platform_by_some_pro_israel_groups\">rebuttal</a> to some of the criticism in which they stood by the platform. Several <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/nora-barrows-friedman/palestinians-welcome-movement-black-lives-platform?utm_content=buffer9dbc8&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">other</a> pro-Palestinian groups have also come out in support. </p> <p>The description of Israel as an apartheid state is particularly contentious. Sari Bashi, Israel and Palestine country director for Human Rights Watch, told the Guardian that, while apartheid does not have a specific legal definition, there are definitely laws that discriminate between Palestinians and Israelis in Israel. This is most prevalent in the West Bank.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that you have completely distinct systems of law that apply to Israeli settlers in the West Bank and Palestinian residents,\u201d Bashi said. \u201cIsraeli settlers have a whole host of rights and privileges that Palestinian residents in the West Bank do not have.\u201d</p> <p>Bashi said that, among other things, Palestinians are subject to military law in the West Bank while Israelis are subject to civil law, which is far more forgiving.</p> <p>The word genocide does have a clear legal meaning and Bashi said it does not apply in the case of Palestine.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to destroy an entire people,\u201d Bashi said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any presentation of how that could apply in Israel. Even if you kill a lot of people, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s genocide.\u201d</p> <p>The platform also drew criticism for its support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. It called for an end to anti-BDS legislation being passed in a number of states.</p> <p>\u201cThis type of legislation not only harms the movement to end the Israeli occupation of Palestine, but is a threat to the constitutional right to free speech and protest,\u201d the platform said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net\">BDS</a> is a movement started in 2005 that was inspired by the boycott of South Africa for its apartheid policies. It calls for supporters to boycott Israel in various ways, this includes businesses, academics, artists and more. Activists also call on universities to divest stocks and funds from corporations that are involved in selling weapons or profiting from the conflict.</p> <p>The movement has gained traction on college campuses in the US, leading to many critics to decry the organization as antisemitic, and linked to radical Islam. A campaign was started to outlaw BDS, with several legislators putting forth anti-BDS bills, with the backing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/05/sheldon-adelson-looks-to-stamp-out-growing-us-movement-to-boycott-israel\">prominent lobbyist such as Sheldon Anderson</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://palestinelegal.org/legislation/\">Anti-BDS legislation</a> has now been passed in more than 20 states.</p> <p>Rabbi Dan Dorsch, of Atlanta, outlined his disapproval for the movement in a <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.735596\">piece for Haaretz</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe mainstream Jewish community \u2013 not to mention the leaders of the Palestinian government \u2013 reject the BDS movement as harmful to progress, discriminatory and antisemitic,\u201d Dorsch said. </p> <p>The rabbi added that claiming the oppression of black people in America is linked to the struggle of Palestinians is \u201cunquestionably shortsighted and will only undermine the credibility of the movement and the important cause of civil rights in America\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>When Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah first read Dirk Bracke\u2019s novel Black, they sarcastically joked that it would be their \u201cticket to Hollywood\u201d, never imagining that such a thing was possible. As second-generation Moroccan-Belgians, they found that Black and its sequel \u2013 a sort of West Side Story set in the immigrant suburbs of Brussels \u2013 spoke to them. But as Arab teenagers seeking to break into Belgium\u2019s tiny, overwhelmingly white film industry, the odds were stacked against them. Especially as it turned out someone else was already making a film of the book. Added to which, at the time, El Arbi and Fallah were in their first year at film school, which they duly flunked.</p> <p>And yet, 10 years later, here they are, on a blindingly sunny rooftop in downtown Los Angeles, thanks to Black \u2013 <a href=\"http://black-themovie.com/en/\">which, of course, they ended up making after all</a>. It\u2019s difficult to imagine two more disparate places in the popular imagination than Hollywood and Molenbeek \u2013 the Belgian suburb where Black was shot, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/16/radicalisation-molenbeek-terrorist-brussels-belgian\">now synonymous with Islamist terrorism</a>. All of which makes their journey one of the most astonishing in recent cinema.</p> <p>Yet far from being culture-shocked, the pair seem completely at home. Fallah is even wearing an LA Dodgers baseball cap back-to-front. They have only been here three months, but between their street style, their Americanised English and the way they converse in tandem like a rap duo, you would never guess they were foreigners.</p> <p>As they re-enact the moment they got the call from Hollywood, they look and sound just like locals.</p> <p>Fallah: \u201cI was in my apartment [in Brussels], around midnight. I looked on my phone and it said \u2018Beverly Hills\u2019. What the fuck? \u2018Hello, it\u2019s Daniel Rappaport from Management 360.\u2019 I was, like, \u2018Is this for real?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>El Arbi: \u201cWe were like: \u2018Oh shit! American voice! Cool!\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/13/black-film-gang-drama-brussels-cinema-belgium-riot-police\">Riots break out at cinema showing acclaimed teen street gang drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fallah: \u201cThen they asked us what kind of movies we wanted to make. We said, \u2018Big shit! Gladiator or Star Wars.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>El Arbi: \u201cThey said come to LA. We said, \u2018We got no money y\u2019all.\u2019 So they came over to Brussels for 24 hours, we made a deal, then it was Toronto [film festival].\u201d</p> <p>Fallah: \u201cIn Toronto, that was the first taste we got of Hollywood. We saw big actors like Idris Elba and Naomi Watts. It was, like, \u2018Holy shit, it\u2019s becoming real.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s about to get realer. They are about to begin shooting in South Central LA: a pilot for the FX network for a series on the city\u2019s 1980s crack cocaine epidemic. Titled Snowfall, it is being produced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/29/john-singleton-police-brutality-black-people-slavery-racism-oscar\">the legendary John Singleton, director of 1990s classic Boyz N the Hood</a> \u2013 a movie Bilall and El Arbi cite as one of their inspirations. Snowfall could almost be Boyz N the Hood the series, it seems. Other reference points they cite include The Wire and The Shield.</p> <p>In their round of Hollywood meetings, they also talked with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/09/jerry-bruckheimer-lone-ranger\">uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the man behind Pirates of the Caribbean, Top Gun and innumerable other hits</a>. \u201cWe asked him: \u2018Hey! Can we do Bad Boys 3?\u2019\u201d says El Arbi. \u201cHe said: \u2018There\u2019s a director already on that.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t talk a lot.\u201d But Bruckheimer did ask them to direct Beverly Hills Cop 4, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/08/beverly-hills-cop-4-pulled-from-release-schedule\">Eddie Murphy\u2019s long-stalled comeback vehicle</a>, which is now set for release next year. They haven\u2019t met Murphy yet, but apparently he personally approved them. \u201cSo that\u2019s already a big-ass honour,\u201d says Fallah.</p> <p>El Arbi: \u201cWe can\u2019t say too much but it\u2019s not an accident that they chose us. It\u2019s more Detroit than Beverly Hills, that\u2019s the general idea.\u201d</p> <p>Fallah: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a comedy, obviously, but it\u2019s going to also be edgy and harsh and real.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48f89feb3bdfc5cc9bffe4d5916d50852480fd68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48f89feb3bdfc5cc9bffe4d5916d50852480fd68/483_451_1286_771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bilall Fallah, left, and Adil El Arbi: \u2018They said come to LA.

Black, which went on to win the Discovery award at Toronto, hinges on the romance between a Moroccan petty criminal and a recently arrived Congolese girl, which sparks a war between their respective gangs, the 1080 and the Black Bronx. It\u2019s a stylish, technically slick movie, full of dynamic camera moves and scored by a blend of Belgian hip-hop and north African beats (plus a local cover of Amy Winehouse\u2019s Back to Black). Yet it depicts an all-too-believable landscape of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/13/black-film-gang-drama-brussels-cinema-belgium-riot-police\">gang violence, criminality, discrimination, deprivation and rape</a>.</p> <p>Black\u2019s closest equivalent, and an influence the film-makers readily acknowledge, would be Mathieu Kassovitz\u2019s La Haine, which pulled off a similar trick of capturing both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/03/la-haine-film-sequel-20-years-on-france\">youthful energy and the circumscribed prospects of Europe\u2019s immigrant margins</a>, treading a fine line between commercial entertainment and gritty realism. \u201cThat [La Haine] was 1995,\u201d says El Arbi, \u201cand when you look around, nothing\u2019s really changed. It\u2019s actually worse.\u201d Ironically, Black has been banned in France, he points out. \u201cThey said the overall atmosphere and theme of the movie doesn\u2019t match with the political climate of the country.\u201d</p> <p>El Arbi and Fallah make no apologies for wanting to make a commercially minded movie rather than a sombre social-realist drama. \u201cThis should be told to as many people as possible,\u201d says El Arbi, \u201ceven though it\u2019s a really harsh kind of story. If you\u2019re gonna do social commentary and not have cinematic value to it, then not a lot of people are going to see it.\u201d</p> <p>But there\u2019s a palpable authenticity to Black. The story unfolds in subway stations and housing estates, primarily in Molenbeek and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/nov/03/brussels-matonge-quarter-belgium\">Matonge, respectively the north-African Arab and sub-Saharan African</a> (primarily Congolese) districts of Brussels. The movie was shot on the streets and cast from them, too. And to the directors\u2019 credit, there\u2019s barely a false note in the performances, particularly from the two leads, Martha Canga Antonio and Aboubakr Bensaihi.</p> <p>Fallah: \u201cYou don\u2019t have Moroccan or black actors. Certainly not between 15 and 21 years old. So, out of necessity, we had to go into the streets and into schools and on social media to find those actors.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZh33h7eBBU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CZh33h7eBBU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>El Arbi: \u201cBelgian cinema really is white. You go to casting agencies and acting schools \u2013 everybody\u2019s white. We got together 400 people and selected the 16 best.\u201d</p> <p>Fallah: \u201cAnd for every character, there was a lot of choice. There\u2019s so much talent walking around.\u201d</p> <p>How did they get such good performances out of them?</p> <p>El Arbi: \u201cThe thing we said to every person was, \u2018Did you ever lie to your mother to go out? Or lie to your teacher?\u2019 And then they knew, \u2018Ah, OK. Actors are liars!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that the directors know this landscape intimately. Growing up in Belgium (El Arbi is 30, Fallah 28), they experienced the same prejudices and disadvantages their young cast face today. \u201cAntwerp was really one of the most racist cities in Europe,\u201d says Fallah, who grew up there. \u201cIt was the golden age of the Flemish Block, the racist party which won every fucking election during the 1990s. The only reason they never had power is because all the other parties had to club together and form a group against them.\u201d He went to a predominantly white, Catholic school. \u201cIn the beginning, you don\u2019t realise you\u2019re different. You think you\u2019re all the same, but after 9/11 happened, you came to school and everybody was, like, \u2018Are you happy now?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>El Arbi, who grew up in Brussels, also remembers that time. \u201cWe knew back then, it was gonna be a suckass 10 years for us. We didn\u2019t imagine 15 years later it would be even worse.\u201d</p> <p>Fallah and El Arbi both have family in Molenbeek. Both are saddened at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/15/molenbeek-the-brussels-borough-in-the-spotlight-after-paris-attacks\">the district\u2019s current infamy as \u201cjihadi central\u201d</a>, owing to the fact that many of those responsible for Islamist attacks across Europe hailed from there. Belgium\u2019s policy of \u201cghettoising\u201d its immigrant communities in discrete areas is part of the problem, they say. They describe Molenbeek as \u201ca different country\u201d. The stores are all Moroccan; only Arabic or French are heard on the streets. It\u2019s similar with Matonge. \u201cIt\u2019s like visiting Africa,\u201d says Fallah. \u201cBut if you go one street to the right, you\u2019re in a different world. That\u2019s typically Brussels.\u201d The only white faces we see in Black are those of police officers.</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t take people into society, you create a little bubble that doesn\u2019t interact with the real world, then you create those monsters,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if probably 90% of the people there are just normal people working and struggling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aba43f90644060c064596ccfb4d519877e1023a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aba43f90644060c064596ccfb4d519877e1023a7/0_29_850_510/500.jpg\" alt=\"El Arbi and Fallah on set of Black.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">El Arbi and Fallah on set of Black.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Voets</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no trust,\u201d El Arbi adds, \u201cIt\u2019s not inclusive. The people that were in charge said, \u2018We\u2019re not gonna help you, but we\u2019re not gonna bother you either. That is the most deadly combination ever. If you just let things happen, it\u2019s gonna be tough for good people to do good stuff and it\u2019s gonna be easy for evil people to do the evil stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Black exposes more than one faultline running through Europe as a whole and Belgium in particular. On top of Islamophobia and racial discrimination (although tensions between Moroccan and Congolese communities are relatively rare in real life, they point out), the country is riven by a giant cultural divide: between the northern, Dutch-speaking Flemish community and the southern, French-speaking community. Thus, there\u2019s an extra layer of social nuance in terms of language, El Arbi explains. \u201cIf you talk French on the streets with your buddies, then you\u2019re cool, but if you talk Flemish, then you\u2019re a sellout. Flemish is the language of the rich people.\u201d By the time Black adds in generational and gender divides, you are left wondering how Belgian society holds together at all.</p> <p>Fallah: \u201cBelgium doesn\u2019t have an identity. You don\u2019t have a big history like France or Holland. Belgium is a young country.\u201d</p> <p>El Arbi: \u201cIt\u2019s like a buffer, made by the UK and Germany.\u201d</p> <p>Fallah: \u201cIt\u2019s artificial. It\u2019s two worlds in one that they want to keep together.\u201d</p> <p>El Arbi: \u201cAnd when you\u2019re 15 and young, you want to have an identity. You want something clear. Blacks, Moroccans, they\u2019ll never feel 100% Belgian. Even Belgians don\u2019t feel 100% Belgian. But drop them in Morocco or Congo, they will never be 100% either. So a gang or an extremist organisation can say: \u2018Come with us. You will have a name. You will be something. You are 1080 or Black Bronx \u2013 or Isis.\u201d</p> <p>The two film-makers formed their own gang at film school, being not just the only two non-white students but also the only ones with unashamedly commercial ambitions. Not that they don\u2019t worship the likes of Jean-Luc Godard, Michael Haneke and Lars Von Trier as well, they hasten to add.</p> <p>El Arbi: \u201cIt was pre-hipster, but they were hipsters doing hipster movies \u2013 poetic bullshit that you don\u2019t understand with no action in it, no conflict either, no ending. Just one character struggling with himself, and some water, some cryptic dialogue, some closeup shaky shit. Oh man!\u201d</p> <p>Fallah: \u201cWe were the only two Moroccans, but we were also the only two who wanted to go to Hollywood, and we referenced, like, Steven Spielberg ...\u201d</p> <p>El Arbi: \u201c... Jerry Bruckheimer. That was, like, the big \u2018no\u2019 word. You don\u2019t mention Jerry Bruckheimer\u2019s name there. That\u2019s why we clicked together so well.\u201d</p> <p>Fallah: \u201cIt was us against the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be0f6226aa537d93b89593386e4d84592246f35f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be0f6226aa537d93b89593386e4d84592246f35f/57_0_1685_1011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Still from Black.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Still from Black.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Voets/PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They did find some allies, though. Their mentor at film school was Micha\u00ebl Roskam, director of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/31/bullhead-review\">Oscar-nominated Bullhead</a> (which first brought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/28/matthias-schoenaerts-rust-bone-interview\">actor Matthias Schoenaerts to attention</a>). When they failed their first year (\u201cWe were making war movies, comedy shit, it didn\u2019t really work out,\u201d says Fallah), Roskam suggested they make movies more connected to their own backgrounds and identities. They won a prize with one of their first short films: funding to make another short. Instead, they used the money \u2013 \u20ac120,000 (\u00a3100,000) \u2013 to make a feature: Image, a thriller, again set in Molenbeek. It was a commercial success, though they describe it more as a \u201cpractice run\u201d.</p> <p>Another crucial ally was Hans Herbots, an established Belgian film-maker. He was the one who was already making Black, the movie. On the strength of Image, and their personal connection to the subject matter, Herbots generously suggested that they direct Black instead of him, El Arbi explains. \u201cAlso I think he was thinking: \u2018Fuck! A month in the hood in Molenbeek and me a white guy from Antwerp.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When El Arbi and Fallah step into South Central a few days hence, they won\u2019t feel quite so intimidated. They can\u2019t believe how smoothly everything happens here in Hollywood, compared with Belgium. They had sleepless nights on Black wondering if enough extras would turn up the next day, says El Arbi. \u201cHere, it\u2019s like: \u2018You need 100 extras? All right. And they\u2019ll be there, in 1983 period clothing and hairstyles, period cars on the streets, the LAPD closing the roads. In Belgium, the cops give you authorisation to shoot and that\u2019s it. If there\u2019s a gang member coming to threaten you with a knife, which happened on the first day in Matonge, they will not be there.\u201d</p> <p>As with Black, though, the most important thing is the permission of the neighbourhoods where the real, often harrowing history they are recreating took place not so long ago. They have made efforts to include the communities where they are shooting, discussing and explaining the project, sometimes via \u201cgang liaison\u201d intermediaries. \u201cYou gotta have the streets on your side,\u201d says El Arbi. \u201cThese are their stories.\u201d</p> <p>The response has been broadly supportive, they say, even if locals don\u2019t always know what to make of them. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Where you from?\u2019\u201d says El Arbi. \u201cWe say Belgium and Morocco. They\u2019re like Morocco ... Africa!\u201d He holds out a silver pendant around his neck in the shape of Africa. They\u2019re honorary boyz in the hood. Perhaps they haven\u2019t come such a long way after all.</p> <p>El Arbi and Fallah haven\u2019t forgotten where they come from yet, they say. They are planning to make another movie there, after Snowfall and Beverly Hills Cop 4. But they also talk of shooting in Morocco, in Japan, of creating their own big-budget Hollywood science-fiction franchise. What were once dreams are now more like plans.

There was a moment, around five years ago, when the Nashville-based duo appeared to have a glittering future ahead of them. Their debut album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/01/the-civil-wars-barton-hollow-review\">Barton Hollow</a>, had been released to critical acclaim, strong sales and a plethora of awards. The press seemed fascinated: by their music, by the breathless celebrity endorsements from Taylor Swift and Adele, and by the fact that Joy Williams and John Paul White\u2019s live performances were attended by a certain are-they-or-aren\u2019t-they? sexual frisson.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/25/joy-williams-the-civil-wars-breakup-solo-album-venus\">Joy Williams: What got me through the Civil Wars breakup? Friends, therapy \u2013 and red wine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And then, suddenly, everything went wrong. A documentary crew invited to film the recording of their eponymous second album unexpectedly found themselves making the alt-country Let It Be: awkward silences and tense exchanges abounded, with Williams and White seemingly engaged in a competition to see who could avoid looking directly at the other the longest. A European tour had to be abandoned immediately after a show at London\u2019s Roundhouse in November 2012, which apparently marks the last time the pair spoke to each other. The album came out, but White refused to promote it, while Williams gave the occasional tearful interview. When the Civil Wars won their fourth Grammy in 2014, White accepted it alone, without mentioning Williams at all, instead thanking his wife and a plumber who was working on his house.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPdDwsKH7kc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CPdDwsKH7kc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPdDwsKH7kc\">What\u2019s So by John Paul White on YouTube </a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Perhaps understandably, the second Civil Wars album had a noticeably ominous tone to it \u2013 funereal-paced rhythms, bursts of serrated guitar, lyrics about dying relationships. Anyone believing that a few years away from his erstwhile musical partner \u2013 \u201csemi-connected\u201d to the music industry, co-founding his own label and studio \u2013 might have leavened John Paul White\u2019s mood is in for quite a shock when they hear Beulah, a collection of songs that White claims he didn\u2019t actually want to write: \u201cHonestly, I tried to avoid them, but then I realised the only way I was going to get rid of them was if I wrote them down.\u201d</p> <p>You can see why the material might have given him pause. A lot of it sounds spectacularly gloomy and bitter. That\u2019s often because it is spectacularly gloomy and bitter. There are songs on here about collapsed relationships that make his old fan Adele\u2019s last album sound like a masterclass in the virtues of moving on and letting bygones be bygones: Make You Cry, which you would describe as self-explanatory were the lyrics not even more rancorous than its title suggests; The Once and Future Queen, which comes packing a chorus of \u201cI never really loved you anyway \u2013 at least not unconditionally.\u201d But occasionally, it manages to make even the most joyful of emotions feel like heartbreak. White has a way of writing paeans to his wife that make his love for her sound like an unimaginable burden \u2013 one of them is called Hope I Die \u2013 and her manifold qualities a source of distress. \u201cYou\u2019re a hard woman to live with, I could never fill those shoes, an example for our children I could never live up to,\u201d he sings on Hate the Way You Love Me. If that feels like an uncomfortably self-pitying way to write about a happy marriage \u2013 measuring his partner\u2019s worth by his own inadequacy \u2013 then at least White seems aware of his solipsism: a song called The Martyr picks regretfully at his own self-absorption, his refusal to let things go.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kh9UhBBDzXk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Kh9UhBBDzXk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kh9UhBBDzXk\">Black Leaf by John Paul White on You</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The latter song sounds a little <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/john-grant\">John Grant</a>ish in tone, although there\u2019s none of Grant\u2019s mordant wit on hand to undercut the bleakness. Instead, White relies on his melodic talent to carry the listener through. At their best, the Civil Wars tapped into something timeless and fundamental that could unite the Nashville establishment and the kind of people who would never ordinarily go near mainstream country. They wrote new songs that somehow sounded as if they\u2019d always existed, a skill that clearly hasn\u2019t deserted White since their break-up: you can hear it on the spare opener Black Leaf, while the gorgeous I\u2019ve Been Over This Before is the kind of heart-worn country ballad that could have been a hit at any point in the last 70 years. But if the Civil Wars\u2019 finest qualities are still much in evidence here, so are their shortcomings. Their least-inspired music had a tendency to devolve into MOR pop-rock, as does Beulah: Hope I Die spikes its AOR leanings with a claustrophobically close-miked vocal and a tense haze of strings, but The Martyr sounds worryingly like the kind of thing you hear mid-afternoon on BBC Radio 2, filling space between the factoids and the Non-Stop Oldies on Steve Wright\u2019s show; dressed a little differently, Hate the Way You Love Me could wow them at The X Factor auditions.</p> <p>In fact, Beulah is at its best when a little of the lyrical darkness bleeds into the sound. White can do Southern rock, as you might expect given his history: his first band, back in Tennessee, were called Nuthin\u2019 Fancy, a name that somehow suggests they weren\u2019t dealing in post-rock heavily influenced by Laughing Stock-era Talk Talk and avant-garde electronica, not least because it\u2019s also the title of a Lynyrd Skynrd album. Fight for You and What\u2019s So offer an appealingly spooked, sparse, echoey modernisation of the genre, more Cormac McCarthy than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricorn_Records\">Capricorn Records</a>. It\u2019s hard not to hope White explores this direction further in future, but for now Beulah will do: mainstream and commercial, but odd and cranky with it, an album that sounds like it wasn\u2019t so much written and recorded as got off his chest.</p>",
