  "<p>It was a good day to query the government\u2019s use of flimsy statistics to justify massive infrastructure projects. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-station-gets-go-ahead\">After Hinkley</a>, we\u2019re on to Heathrow\u2019s third runway and HS2 \u2013 and Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, is unhappy on both fronts.</p> <p>On airports, he still hasn\u2019t had a reply to five requests for more detailed disclosures of the assumptions used in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/increasing-the-uks-long-term-aviation-capacity\">Airports Commission\u2019s final report</a>. But his bigger beef is with the high-speed railway. \u201cHS2 has the weakest economic case of all the projects within the infrastructure programme, yet it is being pushed through with the most enthusiasm,\u201d he says. He\u2019s right.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, the cost of HS2 almost puts the other two in the shade. Hinkley and Heathrow are both \u00a318bn projects, or thereabouts. HS2 is a \u00a342.5bn or \u00a355bn adventure, depending on whose numbers you prefer, and could be hurtling towards \u00a370bn or \u00a380bn by the time incidentals, like new trains, are included. The case for review ought to be overwhelming.</p> <p>The momentum behind HS2, however, seems strong now that Chris Grayling, the new transport secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/17/hs2-go-ahead-transport-secretary-chris-grayling\">has come out in favour</a>. Like some of his predecessors, Grayling has given up justifying HS2 on grounds of speed and instead relies on the argument that more capacity is needed, especially on the west coast mainline. But then Grayling makes the leap that any new capacity must automatically be of the high-speed variety. \u201cOf course it makes sense, if we\u2019re going to build a new railway line, for it to be a fast railway line, to reduce travel times from north to south,\u201d he said in July. \u201cThat\u2019s logical.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/14/hs2-high-speed-rail-project-commons-public-accounts-committee-report\">Urgent clarity needed on HS2 costs and timescale, MPs warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is it really, though? Has the government approached the cost-benefit analysis with an open mind? A House of Lords committee last year urged the government to review options involving lower speeds, and Tyrie wants to see something similar. \u201cThe question of whether it is possible to improve capacity at lower speed and, consequently, at a lower cost, has not been comprehensively examined,\u201d he told Grayling yesterday.</p> <p>It should be examined. So should smaller-scale enhancements of the road and railway networks that could deliver benefits more quickly. With Hinkley, prime minister Theresa May paused for thought and then failed, it seems, to consider costs. She must do better with HS2.</p> <h2>Choppy waters jolt Next\u2019s even keel</h2> <p>For once, Lord Wolfson\u2019s ingrained caution was fully justified. Next\u2019s chief executive warned of tough trading conditions in his last City outing, and he was correct. Sales at Next rose 2.6% to \u00a31.96bn in the six months to July, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/next-retail-profits-slide-as-consumers-shun-full-price-clothes\">pre-tax profits fell 1.5% to \u00a3342m</a>. The punters come out for cut-price sales but it is harder to persuade them to buy new clothes at full price.</p> <p>In the circumstances, the 5% fall in the share price was understandable. Note, however, that Wolfson, who is admirably strict in providing forecasts of profits for the full year, didn\u2019t tweak his projections one jot. He\u2019s still expecting the final quarter to be strong compared with a year ago, when the country was basking in winter sunshine.</p> <p>That should serve as a reminder that the post-Brexit fall in sterling, though important for clothing retailers, is not the whole story. Next\u2019s shares, at a shade under \u00a350, trade at about 11 times earnings and carry a 3% dividend yield. Not bad for a company that hasn\u2019t gone seriously off the rails for a couple of decades.</p> <h2>Juncker talks the talk over Barroso\u2019s Goldman affair</h2> <p>\u201cPersonally I do not have a problem with him working for a private bank \u2013 but maybe not this bank,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/jean-claude-juncker-jose-manuel-barroso-decision-to-join-goldman-sachs\">says European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker</a>, getting himself deeper into the row over predecessor Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\u2019s choice of Goldman Sachs as new employer.</p> <p>Loathing Goldman, as an icon of Wall Street\u2019s power and greed, is a popular sport, and not only in Europe.

An uncompromising take on racial politics, it was <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sundance-birth-a-nation-sets-857365\">picked up</a> by Fox Searchlight for a record $17.5m (\u00a313.5m) on the presumption it would be the next <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/03/oscars-2014-twelve-years-a-slave\">12 Years a Slave</a>.</p> <p>But lately, eggs have been removed from the Birth basket. Despite <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/cheryl-boone-isaacs-birth-of-nation\">renewed calls</a> for people to judge the film on its own importance, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/17/nate-parker-devastated-by-suicide-of-accuser\">distressing accusations</a> of rape against Parker \u2013 its star, as well as writer and director \u2013 have meant its red-carpet-to-awards glory is looking considerably less assured.</p> <p>So no movie was perhaps ever more sorely required to prevent another #OscarsSoWhite than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/03/moonlight-review-devastating-drama-is-vital-portrait-of-black-gay-masculinity-in-america\">Moonlight</a>: Barry Jenkins\u2019s drama tracking a black gay man at three stages over his life.</p> <p>The film has had an extraordinary embrace on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/03/moonlight-review-devastating-drama-is-vital-portrait-of-black-gay-masculinity-in-america\">autumn festival circuit</a>; its brilliance has left few stumbling out of the cinema unmoved. \u201cThe reaction has been amazing,\u201d says the 36-year-old Jenkins in Toronto. He is visibly thrilled \u2013 and relieved \u2013 to be receiving such acclaim for only his second film. \u201cI\u2019ve had a 65-year-old straight white man bawling in my arms.\u201d</p> <p>Loosely based on a play by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarell_Alvin_McCraney\">Tarell Alvin McCraney</a>, the film focuses on Chiron, whose troubled life is split into three distinct sections, showing his struggle to define, disguise and ultimately accept his own sexuality in the deprived neighbourhoods of Miami. It is both acutely specific and easily relatable, touching upon issues of identity, coming of age, family and romantic attachment.</p> <p>Jenkins is fresh in town from the film\u2019s monumental launch at the Telluride film festival. But while the movie is yet to receive a negative review from critics, he is fending off a small but vociferous backlash online. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell anybody this,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I received hate on Twitter when the trailer dropped. Maybe it was naivety on my part, but it became a discussion that I didn\u2019t anticipate.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a1f7f0bb1b6dd8b59aa3a25ba3c87212564755c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1f7f0bb1b6dd8b59aa3a25ba3c87212564755c5/0_115_2036_2544/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Fifteen years ago, that kid loved ballet but the world has beaten it out of him\u2019 \u2026 Barry Jenkins.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Fifteen years ago, that kid loved ballet but the world has beaten it out of him\u2019 \u2026 Barry Jenkins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vivien Killilea/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The vociferous reaction in some quarters \u2013 also visible on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NJj12tJzqc\">YouTube</a> \u2013 claims the film poses a threat to black manhood. It is a sentiment that, oddly, echoes that of Parker, who claimed he would never play a gay character because of the need to \u201cpreserve black masculinity\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cGrowing up, you\u2019re told that being a black man, you have to be that much better than your counterparts,\u201d says <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevante_Rhodes\">Trevante Rhodes</a>, an ex-athlete turned actor who makes a haunting impression as the twentysomething Chiron. </p> <p>\u201cYou have to be stronger, more masculine and the most dominant force in the room at all times. So that automatically puts up that block and you don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to have any kind of vulnerability about you.\u201d</p> <p>Jenkins concurs: \u201cI think American society forces black men to fortify themselves to have to go out into the world and provide for themselves and survive. Again, the more you fortify, the deeper you\u2019re pushing that vulnerability. I think it\u2019s all connected.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a theme that runs throughout the film as we see a boy, who likes dancing, turn into a teenager, who is afraid of liking anything, to a man, who gives off the impression that he likes being a criminal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/21/moonlight-film-tarell-alvin-mccraney-interview\">Moonlight's Tarell Alvin McCraney: 'I never had a coming out moment'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe all have masculine and feminine within us,\u201d says British actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/01/naomie-harris-interview-our-kind-of-traitor-bond-moneypenny\">Naomie Harris</a>, who delivers a ferocious turn as Chiron\u2019s neglectful, crack-addict mother. \u201cWe\u2019re just human beings and I think that\u2019s such a powerful message.

At the same time, I ended up going to a high school that was across town which was all-white and where vulnerability was actually very valuable. I say vulnerability, but what I really mean is being non-threatening. You have to straddle the fence.\u201d</p> <p>In the film, Chiron regulates his behaviour in order to prevent people from knowing he\u2019s gay, but the bullies at school and his cruel mother are aware of his sexuality and persecute him as a result. The experience of being a minority and self-censoring to fit into the world is one the cast find easy to relate to.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a dexterity you have to have as a black person,\u201d says Mahershala Ali, who plays a local drug dealer who becomes a father figure to young Chiron. \u201cIf I\u2019m shopping somewhere nice or I go to a nice restaurant or I\u2019m working in a city where there are not a lot of black people, I\u2019m careful about how I walk and about how loud I talk or what I\u2019m wearing. You have to edit yourself in order to try and not draw attention. I\u2019ve been on the subway, dressed really nice, and seen women turn their ring over or cross the street and when you get that message over and over again that you\u2019re something to be feared, it\u2019s toxic.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a45822785bda0210278c8c0aa7224587ab528242\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a45822785bda0210278c8c0aa7224587ab528242/66_0_2880_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Holland with Trevante Rhodes as the older Chiron.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andre Holland with Trevante Rhodes as the older Chiron.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Bornfriend/A24</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even today, they say, when they were doing press in a nearby building filled with residential apartments, they were told by an elderly white woman to vacate the elevator so she could take it.</p> <p>\u201cWe get lulled into thinking that there\u2019s equality and love,\u201d says Ali, \u201cand that discrimination isn\u2019t something that\u2019s still around and when that happens, it jars you and it\u2019s painful.\u201d</p> <p>The cast are conscious that the film is launching at a time of heightened violence by police against young black men in the US \u2013 and heightened consciousness of such prejudice. It\u2019s a situation that persists, they say, because of the same stereotypes they too constantly encounter. \u201cRecently, I was shooting a movie in Virginia and I was approached and stalked by officers because I had a hoodie on,\u201d Rhodes says. \u201cIt was the most surreal thing. It was unsettling to think that still exists.\u201d</p> <p>For Jenkins, this makes bringing a character such as Chiron to as wide an audience as possible yet more crucial. \u201cWe don\u2019t get to see stories about these people so we don\u2019t really get to humanise them and see how they get this way,\u201d he says. \u201cTo me it\u2019s groundbreaking that people are responding to a character like this. You walk past someone like him all the time. You see the grills and assume all these things. Fifteen years ago, that kid loved ballet but the world has beaten it out of him.\u201d</p> <p>And as for the Oscar buzz? Jenkins is trying to look at the bigger picture. \u201cI try and compartmentalise myself from the awards stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cWe did the best we could and that\u2019s what matters the most to me. It\u2019s really about making a statement that we are all human beings and we feel the same things.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e82768452528adccd28f1f8868ec255d40cf7993\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e82768452528adccd28f1f8868ec255d40cf7993/0_4_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ashton Sanders as the teenage Chiron.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashton Sanders as the teenage Chiron.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Bornfriend/A24</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet such buzz translates into publicity, ticket sales \u2013 and, potentially, change. Moonlight manages to justify (for those who still require it) an increased call for diversity within two hours, as well as to provide a reflective experience for audience members who rarely get to see anything loosely resembling their lives on screen. Given the past year of violence against both people of colour and the LGBT community in the US, the importance of Moonlight\u2019s plea for tolerance is hard to understate.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like it\u2019s an idiotic thing to assume that loving a man is different to loving a woman,\u201d Rhodes says. \u201cYou\u2019re born a certain way and loving somebody is loving somebody. If you strip away gender and skin colour, we\u2019re all the same and, ultimately, love is the driving force.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022Moonlight premieres at the London film festival on 6 October and opens in the US on 21 October.</p>",

The issue is with using taxpayer funds in a way that could give a platform to the worst kind of homophobic rhetoric \u2013 without even binding parliament to the result. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/sep/13/children-from-rainbow-families-discuss-marriage-equality-plebiscite-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52z2h\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2714138\"            data-video-name=\"Children from Rainbow Families discuss marriage equality plebiscite \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d7a185e4b08465d4500198\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/13/160913gaymarriage_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572802&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572802&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/sep/13/children-from-rainbow-families-discuss-marriage-equality-plebiscite-video\">Children from Rainbow Families discuss marriage equality plebiscite</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There have only been three plebiscites in Australian history and the last one was the vote on whether to change a national anthem \u201cAdvance Australia Fair\u201d.

  "<p>The largest and oldest site in Melbourne\u2019s \u201carts precinct\u201d, the National Gallery of Victoria\u2019s main site NGV International is, plainly, a monolith: a hulking slab of grey stone with entrances and exits seemingly carved out as an afterthought. The gallery has an esoteric air about it, which it has earned the right to: the NGV is the largest and most visited art gallery in Australia and the 23rd most visited gallery in the world, with around 2.3 million visitors each year.</p> <p>But in the eyes of some, NGV International has a gender representation issue. </p> <p>In a recent blog post titled <a href=\"https://nattysolo.com/2016/07/30/ngv-cockfest-degas-a-new-vision/\">NGV #cockfest</a>, Melbourne arts blogger Natalie Thomas took the gallery to task for its lack of non-male representation in the annual Melbourne Winter Masterpieces series, its permanent collections and its headline exhibitions.</p> <p>In the post, Thomas criticises the gallery for consistently showcasing the art of \u201cmore white European men than you can shake a stick at\u201d, describing the gallery\u2019s curatorial decisions as \u201cretrograde and boring\u201d. </p> <p>The main offender is NGV International\u2019s arm of the major annual series Winter Masterpieces, which according to Creative Victoria aims to \u201cbalance curatorial excellence with popular appeal\u201d.<strong> </strong>The gallery will announce its 2017 iteration of the series on Friday, along with its full autumn/winter season. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2013/may/24/women-art-great-artists-men\">Women in art: why are all the 'great' artists men?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So far the NGV\u2019s Winter Masterpieces has presented almost exclusively the work of male European artists. Of the 13 exhibitions, six have focused on men and the other seven were group shows which predominantly comprised works by men.

Despite the fact the majority of Degas\u2019 work explores femininity and the female body, the show, she says, fails to provide a female perspective.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afe2f8839e0d6852870ff56bb3bbd9a66ec720c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afe2f8839e0d6852870ff56bb3bbd9a66ec720c8/0_0_5169_3351/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Evie Ferris of The Australian Ballet poses next to work by Degas at at NGV International\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Evie Ferris of the Australian Ballet poses beside work by Edgar Degas at NGV International.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wayne Taylor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The NGV\u2019s curatorial staff contend that the lack of representation in Winter Masterpieces is balanced by diversity across the rest of the gallery\u2019s collection.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe NGV is committed to a balanced exhibition program and collection, with a diversity of subject matter, artists, art movements, media, cultures and gender represented,\u201d says Isobel Crombie, assistant director of curatorial and collection management. Crombie lists the gallery\u2019s current focus on contemporary Pacific art \u2013 including work by Lisa Reihana, Robin White and Ruha Fifita \u2013 as among the exhibitions which, together, feature 27 female artists. </p> <p>But these artworks and exhibitions are dwarfed by the major exhibitions, with recent announcements highlighting forthcoming solo shows for Lee Mingwei, Viktor &amp; Rolf and David Hockney \u2013 but none for women. The 2018 Winter Masterpieces exhibition, Masterworks from MoMA, will be the largest ever show in the series with around 150 works, but only one woman was listed among the 12 \u201ciconic figures\u201d in the first announcement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/09/australian-visual-arts-survey-finds-gender-imbalance-at-most-levels\">New survey paints grim picture of gender balance in Australian visual arts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gender inequality in major exhibitions isn\u2019t limited to NGV International. A <a href=\"http://www.museus.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TheArtNewspaper_Ranking2014.pdf\">2015 report by the Art Newspaper</a> revealed that of 590 solo shows in 68 institutions around the United States between 2007-2013, 73% featured male artists. This year, Melbourne artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/09/australian-visual-arts-survey-finds-gender-imbalance-at-most-levels\">Elvis Richardson released the Countess Report</a>, which looked into gender representation in Australian galleries. Drawing from 2014 data, it showed Australian state galleries on average only feature 34% female artists, while commercial galleries fare only slightly better, at 40%.</p> <p>If curators are leaving female artists behind based on fears they won\u2019t draw crowds, they may not have a case. Pipilotti Rist and Marina Abramovi\u0107 were among the most popular American exhibitions between 2007-2013. In Australia in recent years, Sydney\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Art has presented major exhibitions by Yoko Ono, Annie Leibovitz and Yayoi Kusama , drawing crowds in the same volume or higher than the NGV\u2019s Winter Masterpieces in a period where the NGV presented no solo exhibitions by women artists from outside Australia. (It\u2019s worth noting the MCA has had a female director, Elizabeth Ann Macgregor, for 17 years \u2013 while the NGV, in its 155 years, has only ever had male directors.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Male artists are overrepresented in major galleries because still in 2016 the archetypal artist is a white male</p> <footer> <cite>Elvis Richardson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Richardson, who also runs Australian gender and art website <a href=\"http://countesses.blogspot.com.au/\">Countess</a>, believes it\u2019s the duty of publicly funded galleries to educate and engage with the public about art, and present them with a diversity of artists. </p> <p>\u201cMale artists are overrepresented in major galleries because still in 2016 the archetypal artist is a white male,\u201d she says. When galleries continue to put their weight behind these men, \u201cwomen artists have reason to feel less confident that their work and practice will be accepted and supported and championed\u201d.</p> <p>If demand for art by women increases, the flow-on effects for women would be immeasurable, says Richardson. \u201c[State galleries] have a responsibility to be self-critical and understand the role that museums play in ... defining what is and isn\u2019t championed as art.\u201d</p>"
