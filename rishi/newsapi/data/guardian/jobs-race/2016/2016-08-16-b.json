The Guardian understands that the study was completed in December but officials have claimed that it was not a formal assessment and was never intended to be a public report.</p> <p>In her article, Hills questioned some of the assumptions about the safety of the \u201cless lethal\u201d weapons. </p> <p>She said that as a police officer she had been told that Tasers would protect her colleagues and communities. \u201c[I was told] that they could literally stop a raging bull, take down the strongest attacker and keep us safe. When first introduced, we were assured that they were the \u2018soft\u2019 option.\u201d</p> <p>But she said it was now clear that there had been a number of fatalities. \u201cIn a controlled environment, with medical care on hand and with a volunteer who is fit, healthy \u2013 and not on drink or drugs \u2013 everything does seem fine, but on the streets where officers patrol, that benign scenario rarely exists.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, she warned of mental health, drink and drug issues, with some of the factors being more prevalent in parts of the black and ethnic minority community. </p> <p>\u201cI still believe our best hope is to stick with the core of what we do best here in the UK, policing by consent, with support of the public and the communities that make up the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about Hills\u2019s comments, a Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cIt would be inappropriate to comment on an ongoing Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation [into Atkinson\u2019s death].\u201d</p> <p>Sources have suggested that the findings of the SACMILL report have been communicated to police forces across the country, but not the full study.</p> <p>The National Police Chief\u2019s Council, which saw the report, said: <em>\u201c</em>On the basis of the evidence available to the committee at that stage, SACMILL\u2019s opinion was that the current medical statement on the Taser X26 system remains applicable.\u201d<br></p> <p>However, the group did take action in response to the findings. \u201cSACMILL also made some comments and in light of these observations, the NPCC has reinforced that police forces pay particular attention to specific training on the use of Taser in confined spaces, including use of angled drive stun; the preferred target area of probes attaching \u2018above and below the belt line\u2019, and understanding the difference in probe spread when firing from a \u2018straight arm\u2019 and a \u2018braced hip\u2019 position.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/16/the-guardian-view-on-police-taser-use-time-to-tighten-up-the-rules\">The Guardian view on police Taser use: time to tighten up the rules | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, Alistair Carmichael, said it was disgraceful that the report had not been made public in the face of more fatal incidents.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe Home Office cannot afford to waste any more time and must publish this report immediately. Any delay will be seen as a betrayal not only of the British public but of the police, who need to learn lessons so this never happens again.</p> <p>\u201cTasers might be a good alternative to an armed police force, but the UK prides itself on policing by consent and their place in a police officer\u2019s toolkit has, rightfully, come into question.\u201d</p> <p>SACMILL is responsible for ongoing assessments of the medical implications of Taser use, and does publish those on its website. However, the inquiry was a separate piece of work done after the NPCC asked the committee to review its assessments in the wake of Begley\u2019s death. <br></p> <p>Sources said ministers were committed to giving officers the tools they needed when facing potentially violent situations. But they said accountability was critical, pointing to Chief Constable David Shaw\u2019s in-depth review that called for the publication of data on ethnicity, age, location and outcome of all Taser use. They said the deployment of the weapons was an operational matter for chief officers.</p> <p>There have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/16/timeline-of-taser-controversies-in-the-uk\">at least 17 deaths linked to the use of Tasers</a> since they were introduced in 2003.</p> <p>In July 2014 the Independent Police Complaints Commission <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.gov.uk/page/research-and-statistics\">found that none of the eight deaths it had completed investigating at the time was directly caused by Tasers</a>. Since those investigations were completed, there have been nine more Taser-linked deaths. <br></p> <p>On Tuesday a 23-year-old man was Tasered after Metropolitan police stopped the car he was driving. The man was taken to hospital by ambulance as a precaution.</p> <p>He was arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm after a search of the car recovered what is believed to be a Mac10 machine pistol and ammunition. He was later discharged from hospital and taken into custody at a south London police station.</p>",
  "<p>The police watchdog has said it is to investigate the use of a spit hood during the arrest of a young black man who was allegedly pinned to the ground by four police officers.</p> <p>British Transport police (BTP) received a complaint about the conduct of its officers after IK Aihie, 20, was detained at London Bridge station on 21 July at 11.30pm. </p> <p>Footage filmed by a witness shows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/man-complains-after-police-place-spit-hood-over-head-during-arrest-london-bridge\">Aihie screaming as police officers hold him on the ground and later place the so-called spit guard over his head</a>. The hood is a full face covering used by police to prevent a suspect from spitting at arresting officers.</p> <p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it is investigating Aihie\u2019s arrest and will consider whether the use of force, the arrest and the method of restraint, including the use of a spit guard, were proportionate.</p> <p>Aihie said: \u201cI hope there will now be a thorough investigation and I would ask any witnesses to my arrest to please contact the IPCC.\u201d</p> <p>Aihie\u2019s solicitor, Shamik Dutta at Bhatt Murphy, said: \u201cIt is imperative that all relevant evidence in this case is preserved without delay to ensure a robust inquiry into the officers\u2019 conduct.\u201d</p> <p>In the footage, Aihie\u2019s girlfriend, Jessica McConkey, can be seen in distress in the clip, claiming the couple were having an argument and the police arrested him. </p> <p>Aihie was held in a cell overnight in Islington and released the next day without charge but he did accept a caution for an offence under section 5 of the Public Order Act.<br></p> <p>BTP said Aihie became \u201caggressive\u201d after police intervened in the argument, and threatened to spit at the officers. </p> <p>The commissioner of the IPCC, Cindy Butts, said: \u201cThis incident has generated a great deal of concern and debate among the public following footage released on social media and therefore it is important we conduct an independent investigation to thoroughly examine what happened.</p> <p>\u201cThis will include considering whether this arrest and the use of this type of restraint was necessary in the circumstances. We have met with the man involved and we will be keeping him and all interested parties updated throughout the investigation.\u201d</p> <p>In June, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/08/ipcc-criticises-sussex-police-treatment-11-year-old-disabled-girl\">Sussex police were strongly criticised</a> by the IPCC after an 11-year-old disabled girl was placed in a spit hood, handcuffed and detained in custody for more than 60 hours.</p> <p>The girl, known as Child H, suffers from a rare neurological disorder similar to autism that can cause sudden outbursts of anger. She was placed in handcuffs, leg restraints and a spit hood after being detained on four separate occasions for minor offences between February and March 2012.</p> <p>Eleven officers and one police staff member were found to have cases to answer for misconduct after an IPCC investigation.</p>",
  "<p>Jeremy Corbyn has hinted he would be able to forget the criticism of fellow Labour MPs if he were to win the leadership race, following a rally in Derby where he reiterated his commitment to the full nationalisation of rail services.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters after his speech on Tuesday, Corbyn was asked about comments by the Derby South MP, Margaret Beckett, who said many people had joined the party purely to support him.</p> <p>\u201cWe have had examples of people saying: \u2018I want to join the Labour party because of Jeremy, but of course if he ceases to be the leader I shall leave,\u2019\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cThose are not members of the Labour party, those are members of a fan club.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/16/jeremy-corbyn-floor-three-hour-train-journey-london-newcastle\">Corbyn joins seatless commuters on floor for three-hour train journey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Corbyn said he was happy to continue to work with Beckett, and that the pair had recently spoken about nuclear disarmament. \u201cPeople say a lot of things and I think I\u2019ve got the ability to forget those things,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He said he was keen to move on after the leadership result is announced on 24 September, but said he recognised that winning would not necessarily mean an end to the criticism. \u201cUnfortunately that is not in my hands,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope at the end of this leadership contest everyone will recognise we\u2019ve had the debate. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been nominated by 300-odd constituency Labour parties. There is support here for a different way of doing politics and I hope all my colleagues in parliament will reflect on that and reflect on how we can work together.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn has spent Tuesday campaigning on transport, meeting commuters at London Bridge station during a protest by unions against the beleaguered Southern rail, followed by campaign rallies in Derby and Matlock. </p> <p>Speaking in Derby, Corbyn he it was the 21st speech of his leadership campaign, which aimed to visit every major city and town in the UK. He renewed his pledge to renationalise the railways, which he said would mean bringing each franchise back into public ownership when it came up for renewal. </p> <p>\u201cThe costs of rail travel will be borne by public as a whole and profits will go to the public,\u201d he said. \u201cProfits from the east coast mainline are now going to Virgin. </p> <p>\u201cThis campaign is about the election of one person to be leader of the party. But put it this way, it\u2019s a campaign about the kind of country we want to live in and the place we want to play in the world. </p> <p>\u201cOur programme is about social justice, opportunities for all and a sustainable economy, but it is also about how we do our politics. Do we allow an elite to decide what the politics should be, what the policies are \u2026 or is it about the participation of the hundreds of thousands who are now part of our party and our movement??\u201d</p> <p>His campaign says passengers could see savings of up to 10%, though critics have said in practice that it would take several years for any savings to trickle down to passengers.</p> <p>Corbyn also announced what his team said was a plan to extend public control over bus networks, allowing local authorities to have franchising power and establish municipal bus companies.</p> <p>His leadership rival Owen Smith\u2019s campaign said on Tuesday that the policies the Corbyn campaign had announced were not new. Rail renationalisation was agreed by the last shadow cabinet, and Smith\u2019s campaign also said the proposals on bus networks had been agreed in 2012 when Maria Eagle was transport secretary.</p> <p>\u201cThere is nothing new in what Jeremy is saying. He is simply rehashing existing Labour party policy,\u201d a spokesman for the Smith campaign said. \u201cOwen has pledged to go further to improve our rail and bus networks by promising a \u00a3200bn \u2018British New Deal\u2019 to invest in things like transport services to help get the country moving again.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The publication of young adult novel When We Was Fierce has been postponed by its author and publisher following harsh criticism of the \u201cdeeply offensive\u201d invented black vernacular it is narrated in.</p> <p>eE Charlton-Trujillo\u2019s verse novel tells of a teenager, Theo, who sees a brutal gang attack on a disabled boy and decides to intervene. Its publisher, Candlewick, which had intended to release the novel on 9 August but has delayed it following the controversy, said it is told \u201clargely in street dialect\u201d by the Mexican-American Charlton-Trujillo, author of the award-winning Fat Angie.</p> <p>Charlton-Trujillo <a href=\"http://booklistonline.com/ProductInfo.aspx?pid=8227716&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1\">said in an interview</a> that \u201cright from the jump, I could hear the music of T\u2019s world that hadn\u2019t existed in YA before. Slang can become dated quick, so I had a unique opportunity to incorporate some slang along with a new vernacular.\u201d</p> <p>When We Was Fierce initially drew glowing pre-publication reviews from book magazines including Kirkus, <a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/ee-charlton-trujillo/when-we-was-fierce/\">which called it</a> a \u201ccompassionate, forceful look at the heartbreak and choices these black boys and men face at the lethal intersection of poverty and gang culture\u201d, and Publishers Weekly, <a href=\"http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7636-7937-8\">which said it</a> was a \u201cheartbreaking and powerful modern American story\u201d.</p> <p>But others were less positive. Jennifer Baker, founder of the Minorities in Publishing podcast and part of We Need Diverse Books, called When We Was Fierce\u2019s \u201cconstructed Ebonics \u2026 deeply offensive and extremely hard to read without having to reread, not for interest but for comprehension.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://campbele.wordpress.com/2016/07/24/guest-review-when-we-was-fierce/\">In a review on librarian Edith Campbell\u2019s blog</a>, Baker said that \u201cthe narration in Fierce shows a blatant disregard and lazy vocabulary creation that\u2019s continually insulting in the hopes that it\u2019s avant garde\u201d and slammed the novel\u2019s references to the Black Lives Matter movement, saying that \u201cit feels like a carrot dangled to make the characters seem more real, but for those of us living this life and this fear in real time it\u2019s another flippant element in a text rife with insult and lack of awareness\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://campbele.wordpress.com/2016/07/25/review-when-we-was-fierce/\">Campbell\u2019s own review</a> said that \u201cevery major reviewer who embraced this book was impressed by the language Charlton-Trujillo <em>made up</em> for the contemporary characters in the book\u201d, but asked: \u201cWho makes up language when portraying real people living in a contemporary society? Just how entitled is that?\u201d</p> <p>Charlton-Trujillo has said that the novel draws from her own experience as an outsider, as well as from her experiences mentoring young African American men and working with at-risk children across America. In an \u201c<a href=\"http://www.candlewick.com/book_files/0763679372.ban.1.pdf\">note from the author</a>\u201d on the Candlewick\u2019s website, she writes: \u201cEmpowering at-risk youth to harness their narratives through writing in traditional and alternative schools, libraries, after-school programmes and juvenile detention centres showed me there is a deep need for a book like When We Was Fierce \u2013 one about making choices and having hard conversations.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it had to be something new, reimagined, more poetry than prose. The story \u2026 is a work of heightened-reality fiction, a story of four boys experiencing life as outsiders, told by someone who has spent her life as one. It is my hope that young people will connect with this book and that it may, even in some small way, make things better for them.\u201d</p> <p>But Candlewick has now announced that the novel has been postponed. \u201cAfter discussion between the author, her agent and Candlewick about the dramatic contrast between the pre-publication reviews, as compared to many of the social media and blog responses to When We Was Fierce, we decided together to take some time for further reflection and thus postponed publication,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.slj.com/2016/08/diversity/when-we-was-fierce-pulled-as-demand-grows-for-more-ownvoices-stories/\">the publisher told School Library Journal</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/04/childrens-author-sorry-racial-insensitivity-smiling-slaves-emily-jenkins-a-fine-dessert\">Children's author sorry for 'racial insensitivity' in picture book showing smiling slaves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The delay follows the decision to pull a children\u2019s picture book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/17/scholastic-george-washington-book-slave-controversy\">A Birthday Cake for George Washington</a>, earlier this year after it was criticised for the \u201cdangerously rosy impression of the relationship between slaves and slave owners\u201d it gave.

  "<p>Ruddy-faced tourists in beige shorts, cherry gateaux and lots of trees. Those were my, admittedly limited, expectations of the Black Forest. What I didn\u2019t anticipate was hurtling down a hillside on a go-kart. Just getting to the Hasenhorn Coaster is an adventure. A chairlift transported us to the top, and while my partner took selfies in the chair behind, I was focusing very hard on trying to enjoy the scenery and not think about my six-year-old son slipping under the safety bar and falling to the ground below. Speeding down the coaster\u2019s 2.9km looping track on a go-kart was much less alarming than dangling 30ft above it, so much so that when I got to the bottom I wanted another go.</p> <p>A rectangle of land about 200km long and 60km wide in the south-west corner of Germany, the Black Forest region isn\u2019t a huge area, but the diversity and beauty of its landscape have made it one of the most popular holiday destinations among Germans. Many come for the hiking \u2013 this is the place that claims to have invented hiking for pleasure, when Philipp Bussemer from Baden Baden opened the first tourist information centre in 1864. A century and a half later, 23,000km of walking trails are signposted across its forests, meadows, vineyards and lakesides.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6a57a1560e90e872542320948921b4fbfaf73ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6a57a1560e90e872542320948921b4fbfaf73ba/0_38_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Black Forest go-kart\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 2.9km-long Hasenhorn go-kart coaster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In another sporting precedent, it established the first ski club in central Europe in 1891, and now boasts 250km of downhill slopes and 1,700km of cross-country trails. In summer the hills and forests are alive with the sound of mountain bikers on its dedicated 8,000km of trails. Then there are the activity parks and climbing. The lakes, including the largest, Schluchsee, and Titisee, offer yet more ways to enjoy the natural environment - from Schluchsee\u2019s lido with a giant slide into the lake, to kayaking, canoeing and sailing. In short, the Black Forest is a giant adventure playground. Active fun is in its DNA.</p> <p>Despite this giddy array of activities, the region\u2019s reputation in the UK as a walking destination means it\u2019s not a natural choice for British families. Yet you\u2019d be hard pushed to find a better-value family activity holiday. For one thing, more than 350 hotels, campsites and apartments in the region offer guests staying two nights or more a <a href=\"http://www.hochschwarzwald.de/Card\">Hochschwarzwald Card</a> giving free access to over 70 attractions. Second, Germans are the masters of the child-friendly hotel. We stayed at the Feldberger Hof at the base of Mount Feldberg, which, while not part of the well-known <a href=\"http://www.kinderhotel.de/\">kinderhotel.de</a> network, could not have been more kinder-oriented. Some might argue that it is too kinder-oriented. My partner took one look at the swarm of small children milling about the reception on our arrival and said he needed a drink. At 11am. Further exploration of the hotel \u2013 with its indoor play area, buffet meals, daily programme of fun games and singalongs, and staff with their Happy Team badges \u2013 made it feel like we were trapped in a giant soft-play centre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eec269ebbae83676012a33c0e44c68ecf2a1342d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eec269ebbae83676012a33c0e44c68ecf2a1342d/0_381_1076_646/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The writer\u2019s son on a bug hunt in the Black Forest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The writer\u2019s son on a bug hunt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isabel Choat/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But other guests weren\u2019t as cynical. Most parents we spoke to \u2013 both English and German \u2013 were booked in for a full week, many on repeat visits, and raved about the place; and naturally our son thought it was brilliant. He loved the play area, the pool and waterslide, and the fact that there was a ready supply of kids his age to play with. Not speaking the same language was no barrier to instant friendship. For us, the best thing about it was what lay outside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1a42157877afaeccafb6de25adac9f00e858e530\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a42157877afaeccafb6de25adac9f00e858e530/0_40_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Prime hiking country in the Black Country\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prime hiking country\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hotel is located in the Hochschwarzwald, or the High Black Forest, at the foot of the region\u2019s highest peak, the 1,493m Feldberg. A cable car takes you to the top for views across the Feldberg massif and, on a clear day, the Alps beyond. Directly behind the hotel is Kletterwald, a sprawling treetop obstacle course. Sadly, driving rain and fog meant that this was closed. Instead, we ducked in to the <a href=\"http://www.blackforest-tourism.com/Media/Attraktionen/House-of-Nature\">House of Nature</a> opposite the hotel, with displays about the local wildlife and culture, and a virtual hot air balloon ride. There we met head ranger Achim Laber for a guided walk of the Witchelpfad, a new trail where children follow clues along a mile-long forest path bordered by blueberry bushes in search of the capercaillie bird, via displays of gnome-like creatures and their dwellings. A keen hiker, Achim devised the path while remembering how difficult it had been to motivate his own children to go on walks. It worked for our son, who was happy to skip through the damp forest in search of tiny doors built into the trees, fairies and a model fox in his den.</p> <p>The next day we headed to Spasspark, where little kids can ride giant tyres down a fake grass slope and jump on a large, bouncy dome. That afternoon we walked from picturesque St Blasien-Menzenschwand \u2013 a traditional village of slopey-roofed, timber-framed houses sprouting red geraniums under every window, and famed for its domed cathedral \u2013 to a waterfall, past fields of wild flowers, a goat farm and hillsides thick with fir trees. Again we were grateful for a distraction for my son, in the form of a rucksack hired from the tourist office (\u20ac5) and packed with everything a mini explorer might need. He threw himself into trapping insects in his plastic jar with such vim he barely noticed he was being made to use his legs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bd3bcbda0e6d4908fd1326b171c0652e704c026\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bd3bcbda0e6d4908fd1326b171c0652e704c026/0_48_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Forest woodland trail\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Witchelpfad Naturpark.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hochschwarzwald Tourismus GmbH</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the Black Forest was forward thinking when it came to outdoor tourism, nowadays the focus is on preserving its past. The entire area is so steeped in tradition it almost feels frozen in time, with barely a modern blot on the landscape. The <a href=\"http://www.hirschen-fischbach.de/\">Hirschen Gasthof</a>, a restaurant with rooms 3km from Lake Schluchsee, is a classic example. While the wooden interior is arguably more modern than most, we were greeted by a woman dressed in a dirndl. Its designation as a \u201cnature park inn\u201d requires it to offer at least three regional dishes and use local ingredients, so the menu is heavy on rich, meaty dishes like pork fillet rolls stuffed with ham and cheese, venison medallions and smoked duck.

  "<p>You can imagine her surprise when the young lawyer was mistakenly copied into an email which revealed she hadn\u2019t got a job because of her parents\u2019 religion.</p> <p>Well, she might have been surprised, but as a Muslim, such instances of discrimination are hardly uncommon.</p> <p>In fact, the <a href=\"http://www.islamophobia.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Islamophobia Register</a> has collected 280 reports<em> </em> in the past 12 months of people being abused, discriminated against, spat on and marginalised in Australia because of their Muslim heritage.</p> <p>The president of the Islamophobia Register, Mariam Veiszadeh, says the young graduate told her how the job interview at the boutique law firm had appeared to go swimmingly until, at the end, the manager asked where her surname came from.</p> <p>When the young woman (who does not wear a hijab) said it was Lebanese, she was asked if her family was Christian or Muslim.</p> <p>She decided to answer honestly, says Veiszadeh. The interviewer would not have been able to tell but she explained that her parents were Muslims.</p> <p>\u201cShe said his attitude seemed to change and he said he needed to talk to another manager and he would get back to her,\u201d says Veiszadeh. \u201cShe walked away, feeling sick in the guts.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/11/time-for-men-to-sign-up-to-female-dominated-caring-and-sharing-jobs\">Time for men to sign up to female-dominated caring and sharing jobs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then she was copied in on an email in which the recruiter explained to another why he had chosen another applicant. He wrote: \u201cI found out she was Muslim and I decided to go with the other woman instead.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, with her legal training, the lawyer could have sued the firm for unlawful discrimination. But as someone starting out on her career, it would have been a risky move.</p> <p>Speaking at a Diversity Council Australia event , Veiszadeh, herself a lawyer, says she has been trying to persuade her friends to share their stories publicly. \u201cThey won\u2019t. This is their livelihood. Do you want to be branded as the person who launched the complaint about religious discrimination?\u201d</p> <p>The hiring process is riddled with bias, as recruiters and hiring managers tend to choose people with whom they feel comfortable \u2013 people who look, talk and think like them. So it is little wonder that people of non-Anglo backgrounds have to submit <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/comment/job-hunt-success-is-all-in-a-name-20130303-2feci.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">64%</a> more r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to get a callback for an interview. </p> <p>People with a Muslim background are, on average, slightly more highly educated than the average Australian. But employment of Australian Muslims, in comparison with the general population, is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.unisa.edu.au/Global/EASS/MnM/Publications/Australian_Muslims_Report_2015.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">below average</a> and they tend to be over-represented in jobs regarded as low-status. </p> <p>\u201cHigher education rates don\u2019t translate into jobs,\u201d Veiszadeh explains. Muslim men have a 43% high school year 12 completion rate, compared with 38% of the general population. They also have a 16.7% university qualification rate, as opposed to 15.2%.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying Islamophobia is the only causative factor, but surely it plays a part,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In another case reported to Veiszadeh, a senior person within the police force has complained about being treated with mistrust and being given the impression he is \u201ctoo close to the crooks\u201d to be promoted any further.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/29/diversity-versus-cultural-fit-i-hire-people-who-i-know-will-challenge-me\">Diversity versus cultural fit: 'I hire people who I know will challenge me'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSeveral times he had money planted in his car to see whether he would steal it.

The federal government is helping to fund 10 traineeships for young Muslims to work across the AFL industry.

But <a href=\"http://%20http//junkee.com/optus-dan-is-our-new-national-hero-2/71678\">their response</a> to the derogatory commentary on social media was impressive, with \u201cOptus Dan\u201d calling out the hatred and instead pointing to the positivity of multiculturalism. </p> <p>The Diversity Council Australia is calling for more employers to play an active role in ensuring their workplaces are inclusive for Muslims. Lisa Annese, the Diversity Council\u2019s chief executive, says inclusiveness brings clear business benefits, such as improved job and team performance and a higher return on income and productivity.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to speak out against racism and xenophobia when we hear and see it and employers should have zero tolerance for discrimination and harassment at work.\u201d </p>"
