  "<p>\u2018I\u2019d like to vote for you,\u201d a party member said to me when I was standing to be selected as a parliamentary candidate, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know if Newcastle is ready for a black MP. I don\u2019t want us to lose the seat because the BNP&#xa0;exploits the fact we have a&#xa0;black candidate.\u201d</p> <p>I thought of that exchange this week on the publication of a report showing that ethnic minority candidates suffer an \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/minority-ethnic-candidates-suffer-electoral-penalty-white-voters\" title=\"\">electoral penalty</a>\u201d in constituencies with many white voters. I also thought about it last week after my <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/08/labour-mp-any-other-job-jeremy-corbyn-would-have-faced-industrial-tribunal\" title=\"\">New Statesman article</a> on Labour\u2019s leadership contest in which I said that, in preventing two of the few ethnic minority women MPs from doing their jobs for two months because he wouldn\u2019t clarify their roles, Jeremy Corbyn was not consistent with the claim some make for him of being the only anti-racist in the Westminster Village.</p> <p>I made no accusation of racism against Jeremy. Nevertheless I was accused of playing the race card; of reaching a new low in the leadership campaign; of colluding with the mainstream media; of not speaking out at the right time; of not speaking out in the right way; of letting ethnic minorities down.</p> <p>I joined the Labour party when I was 16. A black, female geordie of Irish and Nigerian descent brought up on benefits on a council estate by a single, disabled mother, I certainly had, and still have, plenty of personal interest in the struggle for social justice. What the many battles of the 80s and 90s within the Labour movement taught me is that now is always the best time to raise issues of representation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"373ea7b9e9828d69432931de856c3485b6c63754\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/373ea7b9e9828d69432931de856c3485b6c63754/1870_693_1375_1935/711.jpg\" alt=\"Chi Onwurah: \u2018Conflating issues of representation with accusations of racism is one of the ways in which minority voices are silenced.\u2019\" width=\"711\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chi Onwurah: \u2018Conflating issues of representation with accusations of racism is one of the ways in which minority voices are silenced.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bronac McNeill</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Conflating issues of representation with accusations of racism is one of the ways in which minority voices are silenced. Who wants to be portrayed as the uppity black victim crying wolf to distract from their own shortcomings? Who wants to deal with the resulting outrage when the issue of such a horrible crime as racism is raised?</p> <p>I understand that outrage, in part. The accusation of racism is very serious, and it should be: racism remains one of the great evils of our time and the fear of being accused of racism is justified. Indeed it is a testament to how far we have come that an expression of such prejudice in Britain today is one of the fastest ways of attracting a media feeding frenzy and universal condemnation.</p> <p>And yet another part of me is outraged at the outrage. When I walk into parliament every day, the paintings and images that follow me around are almost exclusively those of white men. Only 6% of MPs are black or minority ethnic. <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/our-work/news/widespread-inequality-risks-increasing-race-tensions-warns-ehrc\" title=\"\">Unemployment rates among ethnic minorities</a> (13%) are twice as high as those for white people. Black workers with degrees earn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/feb/01/pay-gap-black-white-uk-workers-widens-more-qualifications\" title=\"\">23% less</a> on average than white workers with equivalent qualifications. How does that happen?</p> <p>A recent <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/race-report-healing-divided-britain\" title=\"\">report</a> from the Equalities and Human Rights Commission called for urgent action, as racial inequalities are getting worse, not better. Should we not be outraged at the experience of so many, rather than the possibility that someone we respect may have wittingly or unwittingly contributed to it? I observed with the same mixed feelings the howls of protest when Harper Lee\u2019s follow-up to To Kill a Mockingbird implied that Atticus Finch might not always have acted as the great white knight of the black race should. I felt it reflected a sense of hero entitlement unrealistic in a country where one third of black men can expect to go to prison and the statement \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d is controversial. While Britain is neither as polarised racially nor as segregated as America, we need to take steps now to ensure this is not our future.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/minority-ethnic-candidates-suffer-electoral-penalty-white-voters\">Minority ethnic candidates suffer 'electoral penalty' in white regions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fight for equality is a constant battle to defend and extend the territory of justice. It is not easy, it is not pretty. Working as a female engineer in all-male environments taught me the importance of the support of others: being the only representative of a group does not have to be isolating if you are welcomed and supported. Gender- and colour-blindness will not address the barriers faced by minorities, and yet it remains the preferred refuge of many. I should add that I have had some fantastic white male mentors \u2013 in engineering, not politics.</p> <p>For those on the left, the realisation that there may be more to be done than not being overtly racist can be surprisingly difficult; the assumption that we can rest on our laurels and focus on protesting against other people\u2019s prejudice extremely tempting. But then there is not a social justice bank where you make deposits that you can then draw down on. Up and down the country battles are being fought on many fronts, and after the Brexit vote we seem to be losing rather than gaining territory. We need to respect each other\u2019s experiences and fears and support one another as allies without seeking to silence each other\u2019s voices.</p> <p>When I was asked if my city was ready for a black MP, I said that given my own very real experience of racism growing up in Newcastle I could say with some authority that the vast majority would judge me on my achievements as a local Labour geordie lass \u2013 and I was right. I did not say that the question was like a punch in the gut because I did not want to appear to accuse someone of racism.</p> <p>I would now. Unless we can learn how to have these kinds of conversations with one another across race and gender lines, on the left as well as throughout society, we are doomed to become more, not less, divided.</p>",
  "<p>You\u2019ve never met Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s father, but perhaps you know him generically. <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=paul+coates+black+panther&amp;biw=1638&amp;bih=1025&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqj9XLjenOAhXBCMAKHfxkA1IQ_AUICCgD#imgrc=wVP5rcfK-JoGrM%3A\">Paul Coates</a> was <em>that</em> guy, the ageing black nationalist with his folding table full of dog-eared books. On sidewalks, at street fairs, at conferences, he coaxed wanderers over to inspect his wares \u2013 books like <em>Black Egypt and Her Negro Pharaohs</em>, <em>Wonderful Ethiopians</em> <em>of the Ancient Cushite Empire</em>, and, of course, the works of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/14/blackhistorymonth-race\">Marcus Garvey</a>.</p> <p>Seven years before the junior Coates published the wildly successful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/08/between-the-world-and-me-sukhdev-sandhu-review\"><em>Between the World and Me</em></a>, he wrote this memoir, brought out in January in the UK for the first time. He was, he tells us here, weaned on banal teenage fare \u2013 <a href=\"http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/X-Factor\"><em>X-Factor</em> comics</a> and Narnia \u2013 and on books \u201cbrought back from the dead\u201d, whose titles promised black people \u201cmilitant action\u201d and \u201ca return to glory\u201d. Coates\u2019s father hustled out-of-print books by black thinkers shunned by the professorial establishment, not only on the streets but through a business run out of his basement, <a href=\"http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/66743-printing-and-publishing-at-black-classic-press.html\">Black Classic Press</a>.</p> <p>Fatherhood and the word figure magically in this pithy, lyrical narrative. Paul Coates was \u201can intellectual, born as it happened among people who could not see a college campus as an outcome\u201d. A Vietnam vet, he favoured tofu and Truffaut films. Black history was a fort\u00e9 of his; interpersonal skills were not. In one horrifying and yet comical scene, he visits his wife in the hospital when she gives birth. As she rests in her postpartum shine, he has no congratulations or tender words at the ready. Instead, he blurts, \u201cLinda, I have another child on the way.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Coates had seven kids by four women. \u201cHe was called to fatherhood like a tainted preacher,\u201d his son confides. \u201cThe root was his own alcoholic father, who seeded so many children that Dad simply lost count. He impregnated three sisters, and so Dad had aunts doubling as stepmothers.\u201d Ta-Nehisi understood his father\u2019s faults, but still regarded him as a prophet.</p> <p>Ta-Nehisi Coates grew up in 1980s West Baltimore, almost a ghetto before it lay ravaged by Reaganomics, crack, and violence. A tender, ethereal, bookish child, he tried to keep up with his tough peers, groping for manhood in the dark. \u201cMy cheeks were fat,\u201d he reveals. \u201cI talked a lot, laughed in such a way that I gave the hardest kids around me permission to laugh. That same easiness made me soft, as I bounced awkwardly on my way to class in the morning.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Coates writes so organically for black Americans, while artfully deflecting what Toni Morrison called 'the white gaze'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Throughout the memoir, his self-deprecation is charming and disarming. He writes about all the nothings he felt the planet pivoted on \u2013 girl crushes, driver\u2019s licence tests, in-style kicks. Yet a momentous prescience overhangs. \u201cOn our life map,\u201d he says, his father drew \u201ca bright circle around 12 through 18. This was the abyss where, unguided, black boys were swallowed whole, only to re-emerge on corners and prison tiers. Dad was at war with this destiny.\u201d In addressing such issues, this meandering yet powerful book throws down stakes both small and very large.</p> <p><em>The Beautiful Struggle</em> is polyphonic in the fascinating sense that Coates writes so organically for black Americans, at the same time artfully deflecting what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/tonimorrison\">Toni Morrison</a> has called \u201cthe white gaze\u201d. Coates resists portraying black people as they often appear in the white imagination and refuses to indulge prevailing white anxieties or expectations. Put crudely, the writing doesn\u2019t inconvenience itself for the sake of white readers.</p> <p>Recounting his disgust for the suburbanised pop culture of the 1980s, Coates writes: \u201cNiggers were on MTV in lipstick and curls, extolling their exotic quadroons, big-upping Fred Astaire, and speaking like the rest of us didn\u2019t exist. I\u2019m talking S-curls and sequins, Lionel Richie dancing on the ceiling. I\u2019m talking the corporate pop of Whitney, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/richard-pryor\">Richard Pryor</a> turning into a toy.\u201d He steps out of his teenage skin, and with a hip-hop lilt subverts the mainstream.</p> <p>He challenges conventional assumptions about black boys like him. After two assaults on his teacher and a bloody fight in a cafeteria catch up with him, he is expelled from high school. Coates describes his anguish at disappointing his father and himself, despite his best intentions. \u201cNo matter what the professional talkers tell you,\u201d he writes, \u201cI never met a black boy who wanted to fail.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Beautiful Struggle</em> might take place in Baltimore, but it is not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/wire\"><em>The Wire</em></a>. Readers looking for black-dysfunction porn will be disappointed. The memoir is no cautionary tale pretending to document the loud, salacious bits of inner-city life, all the while glorifying or indicting them. There\u2019s something quiet and elegant about Coates\u2019s tribute to his complicated father, and to his boyhood city. Each small observation on his more-or-less mundane adolescence lures you into greater understanding; each comment on the ironies of race draws you further from apathy or political slumber.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/20/black-intellectuals-white-audiences-searching-for-tales-of-authentic-blackness\">Black intellectuals, white audiences: searching for tales of authentic blackness</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fatherhood is a vexed topic, particularly so for an author such as Coates. <a href=\"http://family-studies.org/more-than-60-of-u-s-kids-live-with-two-biological-parents/\">Roughly 50% of black American kids grow up in a household without a dad</a>.

  "<p>The internationally known imprisoned former Black Panther and journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal has had his request for a life-saving hepatitis C treatment denied by a federal judge.</p> <p>Abu-Jamal was sentenced to death for the 1981 killing of a Philadelphia police officer, but maintained his innocence and Amnesty International says he was denied a fair trial. After 30 years on death row, his sentence was overturned on constitutional grounds. He is now serving life without parole, and his supporters have shifted their focus to his access to medical care. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/07/abu-jamal-death-penalty-pennsylvania-black-panthers\">Former Black Panther spared death chamber as prosecutors admit defeat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Abu-Jamal sued the state of Pennsylvania to receive anti-viral medication for hepatitis C after he was hospitalized in critical condition last year. Officials told him he was not sick enough to be eligible for the treatment, which has a 90-95% cure rate but costs $1,000 per dose, and is taken once a day for 12 weeks. </p> <p>On Wednesday US district court judge Robert Mariani said Abu-Jamal\u2019s lawsuit wrongly targeted the warden and the prison system\u2019s medical chief, and should have named the four members of the state\u2019s hepatitis C committee instead. Abu-Jamal\u2019s lawyers say the committee did not exist at the time the lawsuit was filed.</p> <p> One of the members was later added as a defendant: Dr Paul Noel, chief of clinical services for the state\u2019s department of corrections. The judge cited his testimony that the state\u2019s protocol is designed \u201cto identify those with the most serious liver disease and to treat them first, and then \u2026 move down the list to the lower priorities\u201d.</p> <p>He said prisoners with esophageal varices, or enlarged veins in the throat that have begun to bleed would \u201cmove on to immediate treatment, and if they don\u2019t have varices, they can wait\u201d.</p> <p>In court filings, a lawyer for the Pennsylvania\u2019s prison system wrote \u201cthere simply is not enough money to treat every individual\u201d with chronic hepatitis C and that treating all of them \u201cwould cost approximately $600m. Such an expense would effectively cripple the department\u201d.</p> <p>Even as the judge denied Abu-Jamal\u2019s request he still found that the evidence and testimony presented in the case demonstrate that Pennsylvania\u2019s hepatitis C protocol for inmates fails to meet constitutional standards. </p> <p>Newly obtained evidence in Abu-Jamal\u2019s case revealed that Pennsylvania treats just about five of more than 6,000 prisoners who are infected with hepatitis C. The details will probably be used in an unrelated class action lawsuit filed by other Pennsylvania prisoners seeking similar treatment for the disease.</p> <p>Hundreds who have been moved to the prison infirmaries are \u201cdying in isolation, often chained to their beds\u201d says Noelle Hanrahan, a supporter of Abu-Jamal who monitors prison conditions and records his commentaries for Prison Radio.</p> <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hepatitis C has infected three million people in the United States, including more than 700,000 in prison nationwide. </p> <p>Other states have responded to the health crisis differently. In the last two years New York increased spending on drugs for prisoners infected with the disease by more than 350%. California is also treating prisoners with hepatitis C on a large scale. </p> <p>Judge Mariani wrote that Pennsylvania\u2019s \u201ctreatment protocol as currently adopted and implemented \u2026 prolongs the suffering of those who have been diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C\u201d. He added that it \u201callows the progression of the disease to accelerate so that it presents a greater threat\u201d of related liver disease, cancer and death. </p> <p>Abu-Jamal\u2019s lawyers called the decision a partial setback.</p> <p>\u201cWe are frustrated he won\u2019t get the treatment that the rest of the judge\u2019s opinion makes clear he is entitled to,\u201d said Bret Grote of the Abolitionist Law Center. \u201cBut the judge\u2019s ruling makes clear that if what he considers the proper defendants were in front of him, he was prepared to strike down the protocol and order that my client be treated in accord with proper medical standards.\u201d</p>",

They were told up front they would receive their normal South African salaries in France and could not be on two contracts, he said.</p> <p>Williams, whose CTO company is currently in the UK with his tribute to the former South African president Nelson Mandela, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/28/mandela-trilogy-cape-town-opera-review-denis-iris-dreaming-denis-matsuev-daniil-trifonov\">Mandela Trilogy</a>, said company members were always paid their South African salaries during overseas tours.</p> <p>\u201cWe [CTO] get paid a fee which goes into the pot and we put on operas in Cape Town which lose us money every time. That\u2019s how it works.\u201d</p> <p>He insists that all chorus singers knew what the deal was. \u201cBefore we went to France we informed the 12 singers, there\u2019s this rule in France that requires you have independent contracts. Obviously you work for Cape Town Opera; we can\u2019t have you signing two contracts. You are going to have to sign a document that you are members of CTO and I have the right to negotiate a deal with the festival. CTO will receive the money and you will be paid your normal salaries.\u201d</p> <p>He accepted that the South African salary was a lot less than the money on offer from Aix. \u201cYes, because we live in South Africa. The economy in South Africa and the economy in France is totally different, as are the wages.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot be in a contract with CTO and then sign another contract \u2026 you cannot get double salaries. While they were in France we were paying their monthly salary.</p> <p>\u201cThey were saying: \u2018They deserve this.\u2019 You know what, I deserve a million rand for the job I do, but I don\u2019t get it. You deserve a lot more than you get paid; you don\u2019t get it either. There are other ways to negotiate a salary.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2bada975b0080c91829fdb3ab195c026456912e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2bada975b0080c91829fdb3ab195c026456912e/0_88_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The production of Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte at the Aix-en-Provence festival in France.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The production of Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte at the Aix-en-Provence festival in France.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Victor/Artcomart/Festival-aix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the singers say Williams brushed off their concerns, and that he described the French contracts as \u201cfake\u201d and a form of work permit. The singers say that could have put them at risk of deportation from France and being fined \u2013 a risk potentially also faced by the Aix festival, until its executives put them on their personal contracts.</p> <p>Jaftha said the Aix festival had rebuffed an effort by Williams to get them replaced by singers still on the CTO\u2019s books. The Aix festival has confirmed it plans to use the same chorus members again when Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte tours to Lille in northern France later this year and the South Korean capital, Seoul, in 2017.</p> <p>Williams denied ever calling the French contracts fake. He also denies trying to prevent the singers appearing at the festivals. \u201cHow could I possibly do that when they know the production, how would we train up people to sing it? What about the costumes? That\u2019s totally ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>Fikile Mthetwa, a junior soloist in the chorus, said: \u201cIt has been draining, emotionally. We didn\u2019t expect it to turn out like this, but then we tried so much to get answers and they were not given to us. We tried so many times, but then they lied to us and the worst part is that he [Williams] accuses us of stealing money.\u201d</p> <p>Siphesihle Mdena, a chorus member since 2013, said: \u201cFor the first time, a contract was discovered [by accident] because we weren\u2019t meant to see it. We asked about it and we weren\u2019t given straight answers.\u201d</p> <p>Chorus members said that in one highly charged moment after they returned to South Africa from France to face disciplinary charges by CTO, there was a confrontation with Williams where he allegedly said: \u201cWho do you think you are to think that you deserve this money?\u201d</p> <p>The CTO is now pursuing the sacked singers through South Africa\u2019s labour court to recoup wages paid for the Aix productions. </p> <p>Jaftha said the opera wanted the 12 to repay the full \u20ac31,200 they were paid by Aix, after French tax was deducted. It is also pursuing Jaftha and another former staff chorus member for 40,000 rand and two freelance chorus members for another 20,000 rand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1acdd9b8accaa4eefc3c8750e08822fb0c979ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1acdd9b8accaa4eefc3c8750e08822fb0c979ca/421_522_3076_1845/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte at Aix.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte at Aix.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Victor/ArtComArt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> </p> <p>Fergus Linehan, the director of the Edinburgh international festival, told the Guardian his organisation had intervened after being told about the dispute by its counterparts in Aix. </p> <p>\u201cWe were made aware that the individual artists weren\u2019t satisfied with the arrangements that were being made,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we moved to ensure that that wasn\u2019t the case. We would never want artists to come to the [Edinburgh] festival under arrangements that they considered to be inappropriate or unfair.\u201d </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Aix said: \u201cIn order to preserve the interests of the singers and of the Cape Town Opera, the festival doesn\u2019t want to add further comments about the financial and contractual details regarding this show. Nevertheless the festival underlines that the contracts have been made in full compliance with the French law.\u201d </p> <p>White members of the cast also said they were unhappy to learn of the arrangements. Kate Lindsey, the soloist who played Dorabella in Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte, one of the two sisters who are tricked by their fianc\u00e9s into falling in love with other men, said she had been horrified when she heard of the chorus\u2019s dispute.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a12b95da4cc98854b9ad63f691511d678626c3fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a12b95da4cc98854b9ad63f691511d678626c3fe/0_121_3126_1876/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Lindsey as Dorabella and Lenneke Ruiten as Fiordiligi in Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Lindsey as Dorabella and Lenneke Ruiten as Fiordiligi in the production.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Victor/ArtComArt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The opera\u2019s challenging relocation to a fascist-controlled African colony had been \u201ca huge leap of faith for everyone. To be portraying such ugliness and then find out during this that, unbeknownst to us, members of the chorus were fighting this battle in order to be fairly paid was absolutely sickening. We heard that Aix had stepped in and were incredibly relieved.\u201d </p> <p>Williams said: \u201cThe supreme irony of it all is that they are having the time of their lives. They have got this fantastic opportunity.</p> <p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for me they would not be at Aix. I initiated all of this and I am working for Cape Town Opera. I am not their agent. If they want to be freelancers they should be freelancers, go out into the world, go and live in France, get yourself an agent and earn the money.\u201d</p> <p>Williams is also acutely aware of how it looks: a black chorus claiming exploitation, appearing in a production foregrounded by white exploitation of black people. \u201cI can see the irony \u2026 I\u2019m a writer for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p> <p>He denied that the chorus had been exploited by CTO. \u201cNot in the slightest. You want to try and keep singers employed every single month and get their salaries going in South Africa? All the money is ploughed back into keeping the company going.\u201d</p> <p>Williams also said his whole working life had been about getting singers of all races on to the stage. \u201cI returned to South Africa when Mandela was released after having left the country to avoid military conscription. I went to go and write operas for all South Africans and to work to get opera into the townships.\u201d</p> <p>He said CTO had currently lost its money from Aix and the money it paid in salaries. \u201cI feel deeply disillusioned and disappointed. What have we got from it? Nothing but a headache and bad press and reputational damage.\u201d</p>"
