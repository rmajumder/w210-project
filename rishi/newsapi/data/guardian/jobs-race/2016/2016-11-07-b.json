  "<p>The iconic white cliffs of southern England are eroding 10 times faster than they have over the past few thousand years, a new study has revealed. </p> <p>The cause of the huge acceleration is likely to be human management of the coastline, which has stripped some cliffs of their protective beaches, as well as changes in storm intensity. Climate change, which is bringing higher sea levels and fiercer waves, will make the erosion even worse, say scientists.</p> <p>Researchers analysed rocks from Beachy Head and Seaford Head in East Sussex and discovered that the cliff erosion rate over most of the past 7,000 years was just two-six centimetres a year. But the erosion rate over the past 150 years has been much higher at 22-32cm a year.</p> <p>\u201cWe were very surprised at the stark difference,\u201d said Martin Hurst, at the University of Glasgow, who led the new work, <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1613044113\">published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>. \u201cIf you have a nice thick and wide beach in front of a cliff, that reflects wave energy. But the beaches have all but disappeared.\u201d</p> <p>Coastlines have often been managed to try to protect specific beaches, using groynes or the shifting of sand and gravel. But management near Seaford has led to the cliffs to the east, including Beachy Head, being starved of sediments. \u201cWe need to be aware that when we manage the beach in one place, there is a knock-on effect somewhere else,\u201d said Hurst.</p> <p>He said the new information on the long-term rates of erosion will enable researchers to make better predictions for the future about how global warming will affect coastlines: \u201cWe are concerned that increasing sea level rise and more storms will drive more erosion.\u201d Almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/28/7000-uk-properties-sacrificed-rising-seas-coastal-erosion\">7,000 homes in England and Wales are expected to fall into the sea</a> in coming decades as coasts erode.</p> <p>\u201cHumans have significantly altered this coastal system,\u201d said Prof Rob Duck, at the University of Dundee, who was not part of the research team. </p> <p>He said that past gravel extraction was also to blame. \u201cThe gravels of the beaches of the south coast were much-prized materials for a whole range of construction activities and were extracted in massive amounts over long periods. This has certainly aggravated the problems of erosion on the south coast of England and it will only get worse as relative sea level and storminess increase due to climate change.\u201d</p> <p>The scientists were able to calculate the historic erosion rates by measuring the amount of an isotope of beryllium in the rock platform under the cliffs. This isotope is formed in the top few metres of rock when it is struck by cosmic rays from space and the longer the rock is exposed, the higher the concentration. This enables the estimation of the speed of the cliff\u2019s retreat.</p> <p>Hurst and his colleagues now aim to apply the technique to other parts of the UK coastline, including the stretch at Hinkley Point, the site of a large new nuclear power station. </p>",
  "<p>Iain Dyer has said there is only one man within the sport who could fill the role of British Cycling performance director but the head coach said he cannot identify him, nor is he sure he would even apply.</p> <p>Dyer also ruled himself out of filling the shoes of Sir Dave Brailsford, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/10/sir-dave-brailsford-team-sky-leave-british-cycling\" title=\"\">who left in April 2014</a>, and the former technical director Shane Sutton, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/27/shane-sutton-resigns-british-cycling-paralympians\" title=\"\">who resigned in April</a> amid allegations of using \u201cinappropriate and discriminatory language\u201d towards the sprinter Jess Varnish.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/06/emily-kay-team-sprint-gold-track-world-cup\">GB youngsters defy crisis talk to top track cycling World Cup medal table</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After the World Cup in Glasgow, where a youthful Great Britain squad won five golds and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/06/emily-kay-team-sprint-gold-track-world-cup\" title=\"\">topped the medal table</a>, Dyer, who has been overseeing the team since Sutton\u2019s departure along with the programmes manager, Andy Harrison, was asked how many candidates from within cycling could carry out the role of PD.</p> <p>\u201cOne, probably. That person has to remain nameless. I\u2019m not sure if they are even going to apply for it. I don\u2019t think there are many candidates within the British sporting landscape that would successfully be able to tackle the full performance realm of that role within this Olympic cycle.\u201d</p> <p>Sutton can be counted out of getting the role, as a recent internal review <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/28/british-cycling-upholds-complaint-shane-sutton-jessica-varnish\" title=\"\">upheld the allegations against him</a>, although he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/29/shane-sutton-jess-varnish-british-cycling-allegations-discrimination\" title=\"\">denies using the precise terms</a> and has said he will appeal. Brailsford is fully engaged with Team Sky and the founder of the Lottery-funded cycling programme, Peter Keen, has been working at British Tennis, although he turned down the chance to work with them long-term during the summer.</p> <p>Other coaches who have detailed knowledge of the British Cycling system include the former sprint coach Scott Gardner, a consultant after a spell as the head coach at British Canoeing, the endurance coach Dan Hunt who has worked as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/27/premier-league-team-sky-homegrown-players\" title=\"\">the Premier League\u2019s head of performance</a> but has just taken up the performance director role at British Ski and Snowboard, and Matt Parker, British Cycling\u2019s head of marginal gains up to 2012 and most recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/19/rfu-bradley-wiggins-british-cycling\" title=\"\">part of Stuart Lancaster\u2019s backroom staff at the RFU</a>. A recruitment agency is handling the appointment and applications close on 2 December.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t just mean the realms of athletic performance,\u201d Dyer said. \u201cI mean the technical details Dave and Shane, and Peter Keen before them, exhibited. They had a huge technical understanding and knowledge that came from being associated with the sport for decades. There are not many people in that situation that would be capable of fulfilling that role with that degree of technical knowledge and precision.</p> <p>\u201cI think the PD could [either] be very much about front of house programme management, stakeholders and budgets and reporting to the CEO or it could be very rooted in performance so the scope there is enormous. It\u2019s possible that someone from outside cycling could come in and bring a great deal with them. Were someone to be appointed from outside of British Cycling or outside of cycling in general then it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll have a great deal to learn from their presence.\u201d</p> <p>Dyer said he has \u201csat down with the recruitment consultants and with UK Sport to offer some input into the role and into the recruitment process.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t plan on applying myself.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/31/shane-sutton-denies-sexism-jess-varnish\">Shane Sutton denies sexism but admits telling Varnish to \u2018lose some timber\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked if that meant he did not want the job, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not planning to apply. There\u2019s a lot of jobs out there. We\u2019ve all heard about other performance director roles, head coach roles and other things.

The sisters have not raced together since. Her older sibling has been a member of the Paralympic cycling squad for three years but will join the national team for next week\u2019s World Cup in Apeldoorn in the Netherlands.</p>",

The New York Times reported on the launch as 'an improbable quest for the Republican nomination'. , 2:C - Clinton's opening attack lines on her Republican rivals centred on climate change, equal rights for LGBT people, the economy and their threat to Obama's health care reforms, 3:C - Dropping out of the Republican race were *deep breath* Rick Perry, Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal, Lindsey Graham, George Pataki, Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, Rick Santorum, Carly Fiorina, Chris Christie, Jim Gilmore, Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, 4:C - The leftwing Vermont senator wasn't given much of a hope when he launched his campaign in May 2015, but ended up pushing Clinton hard for the nomination, 5:A - Trump told Good Morning America: \"What I'm doing is no different than FDR,\" referring to presidential proclamations made after Pearl Harbor which limited the rights of Japanese, German and Italian nationals living in the United States. \"I mean, take a look at what FDR did many years ago and he's one of the most highly respected presidents,\" he added., 6:B - Johnson won just under 1% of the vote as Libertarian party candidate in 2012, but polls suggest he could do a lot better this time around. Could Johnson affect the election with an unprecedentedly high third-party vote?, 7:C - Clinton was given notice that her journey to the nomination wasn't going to be easy, as she won the Iowa caucus over Sanders by an extremely small margin. Cruz, Trump and Rubio were the top three of a congested Republican field, 8:D - Trump responded by calling Pope Francis's comments \"disgraceful\". \u201cThe pope said negative things about me because the Mexican government convinced him Trump is not a good guy,\u201d he added., 9:A - Trump pledged if elected president to \u201copen up our libel laws so when [newspapers] write purposely negative stories \u2026 we can sue them and make lots of money\u201d. The first amendment states that \u201cCongress shall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press\u201d, 10:C - After leaving office as secretary of state in 2013, Clinton embarked on a career speaking to banks, securities firms and other financial institutions. Tax returns show that her minimum fee was $225,000 per speech. Speeches given by Hillary Clinton to major Wall Street banks including Goldman Sachs were leaked by WikiLeaks in October. Hillary and Bill Clinton earned $10.6m in 2015, according to a tax filing released by her campaign. Trump has not, to date, released any recent tax returns., 11:B - Trump's comments came after David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader, urged sympathisers to back Trump's campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about David Duke. I don\u2019t know anything about what you\u2019re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists,\u201d Trump added., 12:C - Hillary Clinton won with 2,814 \u2013 2,205 pledged delegates and 609 superdelegates, 13:B - Speaking during a visit to his Turnberry golf course, Trump said: \u201cYou see it all over Europe and many other cases where they want to take their borders back. They want to take their monetary [sic] back. They want to take a lot of things back. They want to have a country again. I think you are going to have this more and more. I really believe that. And it is happening in the United States.\u201d, 14:D - A junior aide eventually took the blame for including Obama lines in the speech, 15:D - The lineup also included Alicia Keys, Paul Simon, Lena Dunham and Sarah SIlverman, 16:D - The comments came during a rally in Sunrise, Florida: \"He is the founder of Isis. He founded Isis. And, I would say the co-founder would be Crooked Hillary Clinton.\u201d, 17:D - In a statement released the following day, the Democratic presidential nominee repeated that she was being \u201cgrossly generalistic\u201d but expressed regret for \u201csaying \u2018half\u2019\u201d, adding: \u201cThat was wrong.\u201d, 18:B - Billy Bush was sacked by NBC\u2019s Today show following the release of the 2005 recording, 19:B - \u201cYou are no media organization,\u201d Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted at WikiLeaks. \u201cYou are a propaganda arm of the Russian government, running interference for their pet candidate, Trump.\", 20:D - Weiner is the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Abedin and Weiner separated after Weiner was caught in 2011, 2013 and again in 2016 sending women sexually explicit text messages and pictures of himself undressed.</p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"1\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"\" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"0\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">0 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n    </ol>\n   </div> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy\u2019s own insights. </strong></p> <p>I became disabled nearly five years ago, losing the use of my hands gradually over 12 months, with my general mobility becoming more impaired. I\u2019m now transitioning into a wheelchair. Prior to this, I had been employed for seven years in middle management with the same employer and was doing well in my career. I had never had any issues or performance concerns, and I was considered to be a high achiever.</p> <p>I was made redundant 14 months after becoming disabled, but with a good package I accepted it and moved on. I interview well and had a good CV. </p> <p>I was offered a new job quite quickly, but when I declared my disability the role disappeared. I decided after that not to declare my disabilities until I had my foot in the door, so to speak. I did just that, declaring my disability on day one of a new job and was made \u201credundant\u201d 11 months later. </p> <p>Evidence of discrimination was gathered along the way and I was offered a payout. Cue next job, same thing, and same outcome. Now I\u2019m 13 months into job four and in same position. I know the signs and am manoeuvring before what I now believe to be the inevitable happens.</p> <p>I know the law is on my side regarding discrimination, but taking a legal/official complaint route is both distressing and unpleasant and I would hate to go through that again. I don\u2019t want to be in a position where I have to keep on fighting.</p> <p>So how can I get off this merry-go-round? Now that I am a wheelchair user, at least I don\u2019t have the dilemma of whether or not to declare my disability. </p> <p>I don\u2019t think my support needs are great: lightweight equipment (laptop, phone etc.), dictation software (\u00a380) and now I need wheelchair-accessible premises. Above everything, I need a manager who will support me, but how can I assess that in the job interview process?</p> <p>What do I need to do differently to not just get a job but keep it? I don\u2019t know how to get my career back on track. </p> <p><strong>Do you need advice on a work issue?
