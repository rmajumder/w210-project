  "<p>Several new studies on so-called \u201cban the box\u201d policies that block employers from discounting job applicants with criminal records have revealed another, even more extensive problem: deep-seated employer discrimination against African Americans. </p> <p>Ban-the-box laws, which prevent employers from asking about criminal history on job applications, have passed in scores of cities, 24 states and the District of Columbia. The laws were intended to reduce the impact of US mass incarceration on hiring as individuals with a criminal record attempt to return to the workplace. Because African Americans are five times more likely than whites to be incarcerated, a major secondary goal of ban-the-box advocates is to reduce the effect of racial disparities in employment. Black unemployment has hovered at almost twice that for white Americans in the US.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/03/ban-the-box-is-a-band-aid-on-a-gaping-wound-that-is-mass-imprisonment\">'Ban the box' is a band-aid on a gaping wound that is mass imprisonment | Steven W Thrasher</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But researchers who have scrutinized the policies have found that, regardless of whether employers ask about criminal history, African Americans face discrimination from employers with ingrained racial biases. </p> <p>\u201cThe core problem raised by the studies is not ban-the-box but entrenched racism in the hiring process, which manifests as racial profiling of African Americans as \u2018criminals\u2019,\u201d said researchers Beth Avery and Maurice Ensellem with the National Employment Law Project,<a href=\"http://www.nelp.org/content/uploads/Policy-Brief-Racial-Profiling-in-Hiring-Critique-New-Ban-the-Box-Studies.pdf\"> in a new study</a> released on Thursday.</p> <p>Other studies released over the past few months have reached the similar conclusion that black Americans may be profiled as criminals. Another released in June sent out 15,000 fake job applications in states with ban-the-box laws \u2013 New York and New Jersey \u2013 before and after their respective laws took effect.</p> <p>Amanda Agan of Princeton University and Sonja Starr of the University of Michigan found that there was a smaller increase in callbacks for low-skilled black and Hispanic men compared to whites in places where the reforms had been enacted.</p> <p>The authors <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2795795\">found</a><strong> </strong>that while the number of people with criminal backgrounds received more employer callbacks overall, the disparity between those given to whites and blacks had increased, with a 7% difference before, versus 45% after.</p> <p>But the findings have split researchers on what exactly to do about it, with some saying that the new policies are exacerbating disparities in hiring, while others say it is underlying prejudice and not these laws that are to blame.<br></p> <p>Professors Jennifer Doleac of the University of Virginia and Benjamin Hansen of the University of Oregon,<a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w22469\"> suggested in a paper earlier this month</a> that by removing data about the criminal histories of job applicants, employers were more likely to make assumptions about these people\u2019s backgrounds. That in turn, the authors suggested, could lead to a reduction in the hiring of young black and Hispanic men because of racial bias by prospective employers.</p> <p>Doleac, who is also a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington DC-based thinktank, said in a<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/ban-the-box-does-more-harm-than-good/\"> separate piece that ban-the-box had \u201cdone more harm than good\u201d</a>, and should be abandoned as a result.</p> <p>But the NELP researchers, who support \u201cfair-chance employment policies\u201d such as ban-the-box, argue that the reform is a necessary but not sufficient policy response to structural causes of discrimination in the US.</p> <p>The researchers questioned the methodology of the Doleac/Hanson study, but said that even if one were to accept those criticisms of \u201cban-the-box\u201d provisions, it would \u201cmerely reinforce the need for stronger anti-discrimination law enforcement and further policy reforms to help eradicate the underlying discrimination, not a rejection of ban-the-box protections\u201d.</p> <p>The NELP researchers said the two studies underscored the need to push \u201cfor a more robust policy response to both boost job opportunities for people with records and tackle race discrimination in the hiring process\u201d. But, they added, it would be a mistake to lay shortcomings at the foot of \u201cban-the-box\u201d policies.</p> <p>\u201cBan-the-box is working, both by increasing employment opportunities for people with records and by changing employer attitudes toward hiring people with records,\u201d they said.</p> <p>Asked about the criticism, Doleac agreed that \u201cit\u2019s possible that \u2018ban the box\u2019 would be a more effective policy in a world with less racial discrimination\u201d. But, she added: \u201cOur research considers its effects on employment in the world we actually live in.</p> <p>\u201cLaws can hide information, but they don\u2019t prevent employers from caring about the information that\u2019s hidden.\u201d She added that this \u201ctypically hurts already-disadvantaged groups\u201d because of how employers guess.</p> <ul> <li><em>This article was amended on 14 August 2016 to correct a misstated percentage of callbacks for low-skilled black and Hispanic men.</em></li> </ul>",
  "<p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, but we have done all we can.\u201d I slowly pick my hands up to tell the 19-year-old eastern European girl in front of me that she is going to have to wipe her eyes and walk back out of the council offices, homeless, hungry and at risk. </p> <p>The council officer to my left is wearing the same steely, but resigned look that I have seen on the face of every council officer I meet. I tell the deaf client, in sign language, that the appointment is over and watch her face fall. No matter how many times I do this \u2013 and it has been hundreds \u2013 it still hurts knowing that I am the person to tell them there is no hope left.</p> <p>When it is over, I smile at the deaf person, who thanks me profusely for doing my job. She tells me that even though the council couldn\u2019t help her get a flat, at least they provided an interpreter for the meeting \u2013 that wouldn\u2019t have happened in her own country. </p> <p>Despite the heavy heart I carry after these assignments, I love my job. I moved into the role quite unexpectedly after meeting a group of deaf children at an event and, after learning the basics, found that I had a real aptitude for sign language. Ten years later, I was able to qualify and started working on a freelance basis. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2013/may/10/public-services-deaf-people-loophole\">Scared, abandoned and ignored: public services for deaf people</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I now work across all public services \u2013 the NHS, courts, police stations, prison services, counselling, mental health, immigration, mediation and education. As a freelance, I manage my own diary. My next booking, made via an agency, is an antenatal appointment. That\u2019s all the information I have. I don\u2019t know if the client is newly pregnant, if they are having complications or if this is just a routine appointment. </p> <p> But when I turn up another interpreter is waiting for the same client. We have been double-booked. After some pleasantries, I realise that the other interpreter is not a professional interpreter at all and has only a basic language certificate in BSL, probably enough to talk about what you are having for dinner and where you are going on holiday, but less able to describe the intricate workings of someone\u2019s uterus. I send the other interpreter home and offer to sort it out with the agency later.</p> <p>This is not uncommon. Most of our work is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/mar/02/interpreters-courts-protest-privatised-contract\">outsourced by the government </a>to large interpreting agencies, which have undercut each other and then outsourced the work to specialists. After the agencies take their share, there isn\u2019t much money left and we are often asked to take a pay cut \u2013 despite the government paying hand over fist for translation services. </p> <p>Many larger agencies lack understanding about what we do, with BSL too often simply added onto the list of languages available. Sometimes the agencies bypass professional interpreters completely and opt for untrained signers who come cheap. This is particularly apparent with legal and court interpreting. Five years ago, legal work was taken on by the best interpreters. Now, they are all agency staff and often inexperienced. The results are clear, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/may/04/thousands-of-court-cases-adjourned-due-to-failures-in-interpreting-services\">thousands of court cases being adjourned </a>due to failures in interpreting services. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/mar/02/interpreters-courts-protest-privatised-contract\">Interpreters stay away from courts in protest at privatised contract</a> </p> </aside>  <p> </p> <p>Back at my appointment, when my heavily pregnant client arrives we sit together in the waiting room. She and her husband were going to decide whether or not to find out the sex of their baby today, but her husband has been held up at work and she doesn\u2019t know what to do. We go in and I stand near the radiographer, who asks if my client wants to find out if it is a boy or girl. My client suggests the radiographer can tell me, and I write it down on a piece of paper so she can take it home and they can decide later. As we walk out, I ask my client whether she has a preference. She laughs and says she is ecstatic; she knows they are having a girl. Turns out, she is pretty good at lip-reading.</p> <p> BSL makes up a tiny percentage of all interpreting services, but our funding comes from the same pot.

An expanse of tranquil water faithfully reflecting back the glorious blue of a cloudless summer sky while a spread of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/white-water-lily\">white waterlilies</a> rests serenely on its surface. Yet this is no planned garden but just one of the many lochs and lochans on the moorland and rough grazing which, for a short period each year, becomes something almost magical.</p> <p>The contrast with the wiry grasses and the stands of scratchy, leggy heather itself soon to come into bloom only emphasises the waxy perfection of the waterlilies. Each layered ruff of white petals curves gently upward, cradling the mass of yellow anthers in the centre of the flower. There is a touch of the purity of the lotus about them, yet also somehow a hint of danger and mystery, existing as they do in two worlds, coming to flower in the sunshine and open air while rooted in the murky waters of the loch. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/11/humble-daisy-brings-smile-face-country-diary\">The humble daisy brings a smile to my face</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em><a href=\"http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Nymphaea+alba\">Nymphaea alba</a></em> has several alternative names in Gaelic, the most common of these being <em>duilleag bhaite bhan</em> (drowned white leaf), and most seem to suggest that a watery fate awaits those who try to pick the flowers.

The government avoided saying they were moving to end coalmining in the Liverpool Plains more generally. Rather, it was just the \u201cfertile black soils\u201d and the \u201cstrategic agricultural lands\u201d that would not be mined.</p> <p>But the distinction seemed like a strange one for the government to make.</p> <p>These interventions were driven by a vigorous community campaign. And that campaign will not settle for Shenhua\u2019s mine merely being shrunk to avoid falling on one type of soil rather than another.</p> <p>\u201cThe only solution that the people will accept is that the Liverpool is preserved, like a national park for agriculture,\u201d says Tim Duddy, a farmer from the region and head of the Caroona coal action group.</p> <p>Jeremy Buckingham, the NSW Greens mining spokesman, said the distinction between the two soil types was meaningless.</p> <p>\u201cNo one believes them for a minute that slightly reducing the footprint of the mine will in any way ameliorate the impact that a 20km long, 200m deep open-cut coalmine will have on an incredibly sensitive and interconnected water and agricultural system,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe expectation in the community is that that mine will be bought out too.\u201d</p> <p>And it wasn\u2019t just the locals and mining opponents who were not fully on board with Baird\u2019s language. BHP denied that any of its mine was actually going to occur under the fertile black soils.</p> <p>\u201cWe carried out extensive planning to ensure there would be no mining under the black soil plains, consistent with the conditions contained in our exploration licence,\u201d BHP Australia\u2019s president, Mike Henry, <a href=\"http://www.bhpbilliton.com/investors/news/bhp-billiton-to-cease-progression-of-caroona-coal-project\">said</a>.

And the hedged language could be a way of managing that manoeuvre \u2013 moving to end coalmining in the Liverpool Plains while saying it is doing something slightly more limited.</p> <p>Unusually, neither the Minerals Council of Australia nor the NSW Minerals Council were willing to comment. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter between the government and a private company,\u201d a spokesman for the NSW Minerals Council said.</p> <p>A financial analyst, Tim Buckley, from the Institute for Energy Economics &amp; Financial Analysis, said both projects are commercially unviable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think BHP has taken the NSW government and taxpayers for a ride demanding $220m compensation</p> <footer> <cite>Tim Buckley, financial analyst</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cTo me they are clear stranded assets,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI think BHP has taken the NSW government and taxpayers for a ride demanding $220m compensation.\u201d</p> <p>Buckley said it also meant the government had shown its hand to Shenhua, before it had a chance to close negotiations with it, having paid out 1.8 times what BHP paid for its licence. If it followed the same path with Shenhua, it would be up for more than half a billion dollars.</p> <p>\u201cShenhua has spent the last 18 months closing coalmines in China to reduce Chinese oversupply,\u201d Buckley said. \u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely Shenhua will turn around and invest over $1bn to build yet more greenfield capacity when they have excess coal coming out their ears and Chinese national coal demand is down over 5% this year after a 4% decline last year and a 3% decline the year before.</p> <p>\u201cChina passed peak coal in 2013 and as the largest coalminer in China, Shenhua totally understands this.\u201d</p> <p>Buckingham said the government needed to confront the reality of a declining industry. \u201cThe NSW government have today woken up to the reality that new coalmines are unviable and the Greens are calling on Mike Baird to commit to a transition plan away from coal,\u201d he says.</p> <p>And while the Liverpool Plains might be the first place in NSW to see coalmining stopped, the Greens are pushing to see it spread around the state.</p> <p>\u201cThe next step must be the cancellation of the neighbouring Shenhua Watermark mine which continues to threaten the Liverpool Plains, as well as KEPCO\u2019s Bylong project and Hume Coal\u2019s Berrima proposal.\u201d</p> <p>Duddy said the writing was on the wall for Shenhua, and that the focus on one type of soil could just be a way for the government to minimise the amount of money it will have to pay the company to pull out.</p> <p>\u201cIt may come to a point where they\u2019ll say \u2018Well the mine is no longer viable\u2019 and they can gracefully back out of it,\u201d he said.</p>"
