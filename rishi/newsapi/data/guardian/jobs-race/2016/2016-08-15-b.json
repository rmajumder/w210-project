  "<p>A Northern Territory bill to legalise the abortion drug RU486 would have passed except its proposer, the former speaker Kezia Purick, \u201cdid a terrible job\u201d, Adam Giles has said.</p> <p>The chief minister was speaking on a panel organised by the Northern Territory Council of Social Service (NTCoss) ahead of the NT election on 27 August.</p> <p>The panel, which included the Labor leader, Michael Gunner, and three social services executives, also covered child protection, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/22/northern-territory-political-parties-called-upon-to-address-justice-crisis-\">the justice system crisis</a>, alcohol policy, homelessness, suicide and the Safe Schools program.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/21/abortion-is-a-fashion-says-northern-territory-mp-during-ru486-debate\">'Abortion is a fashion,' says Northern Territory MP during RU486 debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The private member\u2019s bill brought by Purick would have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jan/27/nt-ama-head-criticises-empowered-female-lawyers-over-abortion-law-reform\">brought the NT into line with the rest of the country</a> in allowing women access to RU486, but failed amid tense and emotional debate, including claims by MPs that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/21/abortion-is-a-fashion-says-northern-territory-mp-during-ru486-debate\">abortion was a \u201cfashion\u201d which would soon end.</a></p> <p>At the community forum on Monday night, Giles and Gunner were asked if their parties would support a new bill to amend the Medical Services Act. Both parties allow a conscience vote on the issue.</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s introduced into parliament, most certainly we will vote on it,\u201d Giles said.</p> <p>Gunner said Labor would introduce a bill and support it. He said Purick had done a good job with what she had, trying to put forward the bill.</p> <p>Giles disagreed and said he would have voted for the bill, but \u201cKezia did a terrible job\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIf it was put to the vote it would have passed, the numbers were there,\u201d Giles said.</p> <p>He said Purick never called him to ask if he supported it. At the time it was brought forward there was some dissatisfaction across parliament at the level of communication by Purick.</p> <p>Purick told Guardian Australia she had spoken to the health minister and other MPs, but had no obligation to consult any member of government or opposition in bringing forward a private member\u2019s bill.</p> <p>Monday\u2019s forum also discussed the recent scandal of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/03/an-operational-matter-dylan-voller-could-be-restrained-in-chair-again-says-adam-gilesw\">mistreatment inside juvenile detention</a>.</p> <p>Giles conceded there had been a cultural problem inside juvenile detention but much of that was due to inadequate training, which had since been increased.</p> <p>Olga Havnen, chief executive of the Danila Dilba Aboriginal health service, said the Don Dale juvenile detention centre was \u201cDickensian\u201d, and agreed training was an issue but \u201chousing children in an ex-adult prison \u2026 is certainly not conducive to changing cultural practices\u201d.</p> <p>Giles said a recent review of the system by Keith Hamburger had found the previous Labor government should have built a new juvenile centre instead of the $1.7bn adult facility outside Darwin.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/08/adam-giles-juvenile-detention-report-northern-territory-royal-commission\">Giles last week reneged on a repeatedly offered commitment</a> that he would release the Hamburger review.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate public policy to think we need to build more jails,\u201d Havnen said.</p> <p>The chief executive of Anglicare NT, David Pugh, said the federal government was involved in child protection nearly as much as the NT government, but \u201cthere is almost zero cooperation that I can see\u201d between the two in relation to early childhood planning.</p> <p>He said the NT Department of Children and Families was under-resourced and was \u201cbunkered down in a corner\u201d with no overarching plan, and the NT was struggling to work with its own geography.</p> <p>Gunner said there had to be \u201cgenerational transformational change\u201d. He said an elected Labor government would have a minister for children, which oversaw health, education and child protection to avoid \u201csilos\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p></p>",
  "<p>After a year-and-a-half of finding the humor in some of the bleakest moments in American race relations in decades, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/15/nightly-show-larry-wilmore-cancelled-comedy-central\">Comedy Central is ending Larry Wilmore\u2019s The Nightly Show</a>. I hesitate to call a satirical half-hour talk show a \u201cgrand experiment\u201d, but it was as close as one can get because the overriding topic of conversation was almost always race \u2013 a subject Americans aren\u2019t always excited to discuss frankly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/15/nightly-show-larry-wilmore-cancelled-comedy-central\">Comedy Central cancels The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even if the network stressed that the show would have mass appeal, the very fact that black and brown faces dominated the program both in front of and behind the camera necessitated discussions of race, far more than on any other late-night talk show. As such, the format of The Nightly Show did not lend itself to the cocktail party vibe of the biggest late-night franchises: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jimmy-fallon\">The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/james-corden\">The Late Late Show with James Corden</a>. A light-hearted, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/21/michelle-obama-on-carpool-karaoke-with-james-corden-video\">carpool karaoke</a>-esque segment would jar viewers next to a conversation about the trials of the police officers involved in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/freddie-gray\">the death of Freddie Gray </a>or<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/08/dallas-protest-shooting-hillary-clinton-email-case\"> the attacks on cops in Dallas</a>. A Hollywood Reporter piece on the cancellation <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/larry-wilmore-nightly-show-canceled-919407\">pointed to Wilmore\u2019s de-emphasizing of so-called \u201cviral hits\u201d</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s not designed to have the type of things that [Jimmy] Fallon and [James] Corden do, like the [carpool] karaoke type of thing or lip sync battle and those types of things because those are such pure comic things,\u201d Wilmore had told the Reporter.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NysITFb_Wbs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NysITFb_Wbs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s peculiar that there would even be a question as to whether The Nightly Show would attempt to engage in that world. Its lead-in was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/18/jon-stewart-why-i-quit-the-daily-show\">The Daily Show</a>, the doyenne of modern televised American satire. The Daily Show directly birthed The Nightly Show (and before that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/18/colbert-report-10-best-moments\">The Colbert Report</a>); plus, the stars of HBO\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver\">Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</a>, TBS\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.tbs.com/shows/full-frontal-with-samantha-bee.html\">Full Frontal with Samantha Bee</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stephen-colbert\">The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</a> are all Daily Show alums. The viral success of those shows usually comes down to the timeliness and passion of the host\u2019s monologues or a clever remote piece.</p> <p>The Nightly Show shined the brightest with its panel \u2013 a healthy mix of media personalities, such as MTV News\u2019s <a href=\"http://anamariecox.typepad.com/\">Ana Marie Cox</a> and New York magazine\u2019s<a href=\"http://nymag.com/author/Rembert%20Browne/\"> Rembert Browne</a>, and minority comedians including <a href=\"http://observer.com/2016/05/mike-yard-nightly-show/\">Mike Yard</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=Grace+Parra&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Esearch\">Grace Parra</a>. At times, it felt like the vital conversations on black and feminist Twitter finally had a safe home on TV. Those conversations could be funny, but they were also vital. In the aftermath of the cancellation, one must ask if there\u2019s still a home for satire from a minority perspective on television.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/cast/michael-che-15486\">Michael Che </a>still holds his seat on Saturday Night Live\u2019s Weekend Update and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/02/trevor-noah-on-replacing-jon-stewart-and-changing-the-daily-show\">Trevor Noah\u2019s hosting of the Daily Show</a> is an important step in the right direction, which Comedy Central president Kent Alterman pointed out in his statement on the cancellation decision. But SNL can\u2019t go into the depth that The Nightly Show could, with a full half-hour devoted to racial issues, and Trevor Noah\u2019s experience as a South African is different from Wilmore\u2019s as an African American. This is not to say that Noah can\u2019t speak on American race issues, but the scars of our particular brand of racism are unique.</p> <p>There\u2019s hope in the form of shows like NBC\u2019s sitcom <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/the-carmichael-show\">The Carmichael Show</a> and <a href=\"http://www.adultswim.com/videos/the-eric-andre-show/\">Adult Swim\u2019s The Eric Andre Show</a>. Both programs look at race in different ways \u2013 Jerrod Carmichael\u2019s series uses the classic family comedy template inherited from 1970s Norman Lear shows like<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066626/\"> All in the Family</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072519/\">The Jeffersons</a> to tweak American race relations. Andre is far more surreal and casts a sideways glance at prejudice \u2013 smashing his way through his point rather than batting it around gently.</p> <p>The medium of the late-night talk show offers so much to the conversation on race, though. Having a Last Week Tonight or Full Frontal devoted to these issues is needed at a time when there\u2019s still so much resistance to even talking about racism from people like Donald Trump and his cronies. Even with the end of The Nightly Show and black comics such as W Kamau Bell and Hannibal Burress struggling to keep their shows on the air, there\u2019s ample talent waiting in the wings, both as hosts and writers. Minorities and allies need to support these shows when they deserve it. Seek out comics like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UlYe6tap6Q\">Solomon Georgio</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Travon\">Travon Free</a> and The Nightly Show alum <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chescaleigh\">Franchesca Ramsey</a>.

Not just in his music, but his writings, speeches and university lecture series. Ahead of a tour with his new group Prophets of Rage \u2013 which includes members of Cypress Hill and Rage Against The Machine \u2013 the Guardian spoke with Chuck on current matters of the state, his frustrations, Barack Obama and the current political landscape.</p> <p><strong>Why do you think songs like Fight the Power or 911\u2019s A Joke still resonate?</strong></p> <p>When I said \u201cfight the power\u201d my influences are about the <em>we</em>, not the <em>me</em>. So people say that stuff I\u2019ve said is still relevant today and I\u2019m glad. But I say it\u2019s <em>still </em>around and <em>will </em>always be around because I didn\u2019t make it up. I was able to write a song that gave narrative to things, but I didn\u2019t invent the sentiment or own the slogan.</p> <p><strong>How do you explain the rise of Donald Trump?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s not so much him or even the audacity of Trump \u2013 he\u2019s just a businessman. And as a businessman, he will fight democracy and government, not fight for it. I think after he wins, he\u2019ll sit and enjoy feeling his power for a while and being the businessman that he is, he\u2019ll just go for bigger deals internationally that\u2019ll serve him. I believe his intent is to take over the military. He\u2019ll also work for the prison industrial complex and all its materialistic power structures will thrive with little opposition.</p> <p><strong>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings\">The Counted</a> showed police encounters with communities of colour are much more likely to end in violence. Why do you think that is?</strong></p> <p>I think \u2013 and this is the first time I\u2019ve really talked about this \u2013 is that policing in the US has been so bad because of state laws. These states have the nerve to make it all about them and no one can tell them what to do. So there\u2019s a huge detachment with these states acting and functioning as a state within other states. The other thing that makes policing so lopsided is that counties have their own policing and jurisdiction and they\u2019re not compliant or united. They\u2019re ran on ego and their own sort of fiefdom. And states are made of many, many counties. Say you\u2019re driving across county lines, each and every county has different systems in place as to how they\u2019re gonna deal with you. Policing is evidently not working in the 21st century United States. </p> <p><strong>What are your thoughts on Black Lives Matter?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s a defensive movement. It\u2019s just saying, \u201cHey, you need to treat us like people and that we\u2019re not going to tolerate being slaughtered like pigs or sheep.\u201d The whole thing that thinking that BLM is an offensive movement is wrong. All lives matter, true, but if we don\u2019t treat all lives equally then no lives matter.</p> <p><strong>What do you think President Obama\u2019s legacy will be?</strong></p> <p>When you say \u201chow he\u2019ll be remembered\u201d, the media will be making that judgment call. So the question really is, what is media? Will it be a small group of guys controlling Obama\u2019s narrative? I think Obama is the best we ever had, best that ever did it, but worse is on the horizon. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s just worse on the horizon, not the worst. Worst being Trump.</p> <p><strong>How will you personally remember President Obama?</strong></p> <p>Besides my inner most beliefs on what government does, I truly believe he battled with the government. As a black man in the United States with its history, I expect nothing from the government [<em>laughs</em>]. But Obama\u2019s also had to endure such and onslaught of direct hatred from the system. He\u2019s also been so ostracized. I remember eight years of George Bush when everyone was scrambling.

Why did Hillary choose [Tim] Kaine and not make Bernie her running mate? Well the answer is because Hilary is backed by wealthy investors.

You can be youthful and full of youth, but don\u2019t be a fool for youth; this society tries to make you hang onto your youth by any means necessary.

It is not up to any one person to say, \u201cI am offended\u201d. Nor should we dismiss or sneer at the kind of concerns that have led to the rise of Hansonist populism in July\u2019s election.

It feeds the worst kind of movements capable of growing into hate that can do more than just offend \u2013 it can put racial and ethnic minorities in physical and mental harm\u2019s way.</p> <p>As minorities of all backgrounds justifiably fear what the revival of Pauline Hanson and One Nation will mean for racism in this country, 18C\u2019s repeal would send all the wrong signals that the rivers of hate are starting to break through.

We can have serious, mature debates about issues of significance without racial discrimination and vilification. 18C won\u2019t prevent us from doing so \u2013 only small-mindedness and arrogance will. What 18C does \u2013 providing respite to victims of racism and bigotry \u2013 is too important for that. Now is exactly the worst time to repeal it.</p>",

  "<p>Bill Leak\u2019s racist cartoon has added nothing constructive to the \u201ccrucial debate\u201d about the ongoing discrimination and disadvantage faced by First Nations people in Australia\u2019s criminal justice system. Its publication was instead merely a crude provocation devised to foreground the latest assault on the racial discrimination act.</p> <p>In the days following publication, Leak described his cartoon, which depicts an Aboriginal policeman returning an Aboriginal boy to his Aboriginal father, who \u2013 with beer can in hand \u2013 has forgotten his son\u2019s name, as \u201cclearly not\u201d racist. According to Leak, the cartoon instead <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2016/s4515481.htm\">serves the public interest</a> by way of provoking an \u201cimportant discussion\u201d about the real issues from which stemmed the reprehensible treatment of Indigenous children imprisoned in the Northern Territory\u2019s now infamous Don Dale juvenile detention facility.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/07/im-an-aboriginal-father-i-dont-want-my-kids-to-see-racist-garbage-in-the-media\">I'm an Aboriginal father. I don't want my kids to see racist garbage in the media | Luke Pearson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The assertion that Bill Leak and his editors make is already widely understood. There\u2019s nothing exceptionally astute or extraordinarily perceptive about it. By now the Australian public is broadly aware that Aboriginal communities are severely impacted by issues that contribute to high incarceration rates, and more specifically the high incarceration rates of Indigenous children, particularly in the Northern Territory. </p> <p>The problem with Leak\u2019s cartoon is that it stalls, either wittingly or otherwise, well before the important conversation begins. It fails to broach in any meaningful or even clever way, the systematic, root causes of the <a href=\"http://www.aic.gov.au/crime_types/in_focus/indigenousjustice.html\">over-representation of First Nations</a> people in the criminal justice system. With Leak and his supporters, as is the case with successive federal and state governments, it is as though the 339 recommendations of the 1991 royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody simply do not exist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Bill Leak's cartoon\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Bill Leak&amp;#39;s cartoon is certainly a talking point today. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/s46MirH9oC&quot;&gt;https://t.co/s46MirH9oC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Ui07M7EwSO&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ui07M7EwSO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Australian Opinion (@AusOpinion) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AusOpinion/status/761006684626038784&quot;&gt;August 4, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Instead of alluding to inherently discriminatory policies such as paperless arrests or \u201cone size fits all\u201d mandatory sentencing laws which disproportionately affect Indigenous communities, Leak\u2019s cartoon simply and inappropriately places \u201cgratuitous emphasis on race\u201d in his representation of the complex issues at hand. In contrast, the #IndigenousDads social media response to the cartoon was imbued not only with compassion, but deeper, constructive consideration of such issues.</p> <p>Far from <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/chris-kenny/outrage-over-bill-leak-cartoon-misses-the-point/news-story/db1a205b2d78ff61a309ced66df226ae\">being a diversion</a> from the \u201ccrucial debate\u201d, as suggested by the Australian\u2019s Chris Kenny, the #IndigenousDads response correctly realigned the conversation. In the first instance, Aboriginal dads simply don\u2019t deserve the kind of <a href=\"http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/images/history/toons/toon68.html\">historical stereotyping</a> that Leak reproduced. By virtue of that clarification, the spotlight was rightfully shifted onto discriminatory policies and laws that continue to disadvantage vulnerable communities and individuals.</p> <p>Instead of derision, these sudden social movements \u2013 regardless of where or how they originate \u2013 should be celebrated as genuine acts of reconciliation between Indigenous and non-indigenous citizens. Not only did #IndigenousDads mitigate the offence caused by Leak\u2019s racist cartoon, the action demonstrated a willingness to constructively engage in the conversation Kenny refers to. </p> <p>As the Australian\u2019s editor-in-chief Paul Whittaker wrote in his statement following publication of Leak\u2019s cartoon: \u201cToo often, too many people skirt around the root causes and tough issues.\u201d Ironically, that\u2019s exactly what Leak\u2019s racist cartoon perpetuates, and it should be censured for doing so.</p> <p>The Australian Press Council has <a href=\"http://www.presscouncil.org.au/document-search/adj-1634/\">an obvious precedent</a> in its adjudication of the Glen Le Lievre\u2019s cartoon published in the Sydney Morning Herald in July 2014. Le Lievre\u2019s cartoon depicted \u201can elderly man with a large nose, wearing \u2026 a yarmulke sitting in an armchair emblazoned with the Star of David \u2026 pointing a TV remote control device at an exploding cityscape, implied to be Gaza\u201d.</p> <p>In that case, after questioning by the council, the SMH agreed that the cartoon placed \u201cgratuitous emphasis\u201d on \u201creligious persuasion rather than Israeli nationality, thereby causing offence\u201d. </p> <p>The Leak cartoon does something similar, basing its unnecessary and gratuitous provocation on race alone. <br></p>"
