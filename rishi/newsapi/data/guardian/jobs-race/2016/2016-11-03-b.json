  "<p>There\u2019s an all-too-resonant scene in Joachim Lafosse\u2019s bitter drama in which children have their age verified by their teeth \u2013 though the drama focuses on westerners who actually want to welcome refugees. A bit too much, in fact: in a story based on the real-life 2007 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/29/spain.france\">Zoe\u2019s Ark controversy</a>, Vincent Lindon leads an NGO in Chad that masquerades as an orphanage but plans to abscond with the kids back to adoptive families in France. The organisation lets neither the fractious Saharan security situation, or the local chiefs\u2019 pragmatic propensity for fibbing about the ages and parentage of kids they wish to offload, get in the way of its unwavering and mostly selfish idealism. </p> <p>It\u2019s a diagnosis of geopolitical power relations nearly as effective as the 2012 Somali pirate thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/09/a-hijacking-review\">A Hijacking</a>. Lafosse damns his do-gooders in a disciplined set of medium-shot dustscapes and murky Conradian interiors, rarely allowing anyone \u2013 even the pugnacious, impatient Lindon \u2013 to plead their case in closeup. A slanted but shrewd look at another side of today\u2019s refugee crisis.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8IBvKQoD1s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M8IBvKQoD1s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>",

The commercial aimed to target, in particular, married women in the suburbs of swing states Colorado, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p> <p>As the sexual assault tape came to light, Clinton intensified her pitch against her opponent\u2019s treatment of women.</p> <p>Addressing a \u201cWomen for Hillary\u201d a conference call, one week before the election, Clinton appealed to supporters on a personal level.</p> <p>\u201cI know that parts of this election have been painful to many women, especially hearing about Donald Trump\u2019s behavior towards women over the years,\u201d she said. \u201cHe relishes making women feel terrible about themselves in every possible way.

It is extraordinary that this woman, as our own president says, has more experience, more preparation to go into the Oval Office than anyone we can remember, and it was just always going to be hard.\u201d</p> <p>But the gendered circumstances of Clinton\u2019s battle, according to Richards \u2013 from the focus on her clothes to her speaking style to whether she smiles enough \u2013 is what motivates women voters to make their voices heard on 8 November.</p> <p>\u201cWomen feel this is about much more than Hillary, this is about work that has been going on for decades,\u201d she said. \u201cThese women feel an enormous sense of pride and ownership in this election.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps few moments crystallized that sentiment better than when Trump leaned into his microphone during the final presidential debate and snarled: \u201cSuch a nasty woman.\u201d</p> <p>Women supporting Clinton immediately reclaimed the phrase and turned it into a rallying cry, and it became a recurring theme at campaign events to see women with \u201cNasty Women\u201d shirts.

Clinton has emphasized her commitment to such issues since launching her campaign, and also focused on raising the minimum wage, an issue inextricably tied to gender in that women make up two-thirds of minimum wage earners.</p> <p>Jess O\u2019Connell, the executive director of Emily\u2019s List, said Trump was simply vocalizing in politically incorrect terms what Republicans have long advocated in more veiled language.</p> <p>\u201cSingle women are afraid the Republicans are going to turn back the clocks on them,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cIgnoring the gender gap in wages or wanting to punish women for having an abortion shows a real lack of understanding about women and their lives today.</p> <p>\u201cThis is when women\u2019s voices are going to be heard.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

But Pittman and others are trying to generate enthusiasm in African American communities with a pitch that is not necessarily focused on the race for the White House.</p> <p>In Harris County \u2013 which, with about 4.4 million residents, is more populous than 24 US states \u2013 a Democrat may be about to oust a Republican in a highly influential position: the county prosecutor.</p> <p>A University of Houston poll last month gave Kim Ogg a lead of seven percentage points over the incumbent district attorney, Devon Anderson. She was appointed by former Texas governor Rick Perry in 2013 to succeed her husband, Mike, who died of cancer, and beat Ogg in an election the following year.</p> <p>But Anderson\u2019s office has been beset by controversies including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/texas-rape-victim-county-jail-bipolar-disorder-lawsuit\">jailing of a rape victim</a> to ensure she would testify against her attacker, accusations that Anderson stoked racial tensions after a white sheriff\u2019s deputy was shot dead by a mentally ill black man, and <a href=\"http://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/recommendations/article/For-Kim-Ogg-9202209.php\">complaints</a> that she has not introduced truly transformative reforms to a system that critics say treats low-income, low-level offenders unfairly.</p> <p>\u201cI explain to them how important it is to not just vote presidential but to vote for your locals as well,\u201d said Tarasha Hollis, who oversees a team of 12 canvassers paid $12.50 an hour.

The #VotingWhileBlack initiative is harnessing technology in an effort to increase African American voter engagement in notable contests across the country.</p> <p>In addition to the race for Harris County district attorney, #VotingWhileBlack is focusing on elections of prosecutors in Ohio and Florida in targeted attempts to replace officials they feel have poorly served black communities.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re the most incarcerated country and that didn\u2019t happen overnight or by mistake, it happened by a whole set of decisions that are made every day, and the most powerful actors in the criminal justice space are district attorneys,\u201d said Rashad Robinson, a civil rights activist and spokesman for Color of Change Pac, which is backing the campaign.</p> <p>\u201cThey determine whether or not police are held accountable but they also determine every day whether or not someone gets a misdemeanor or a felony, whether someone gets a second chance, whether someone\u2019s bail is set extremely high.\u201d</p> <p>In Harris County, Robinson argued, the district attorney has failed to institute progressive reforms and maintained old-fashioned tough-on-crime policies that unduly penalize communities of color. A spokesperson for Anderson did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>To educate voters and encourage them to head to the ballot box, #VotingWhileBlack has taken inspiration from some of the successful outreach tactics of the Bernie Sanders campaign, including the use of text messaging.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve bought the access to black folks\u2019 cellphones through the voter file and then coordinated that through the voter file to be able to identify registered black voters in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and also adding in the Harris County district attorney race,\u201d Robinson said.</p> <p>He said the initiative has sent more than 2.2m text messages and attracted nearly 1,500 volunteers for events such as \u201ctext-a-thons\u201d, where attendees try to engage possible voters in text conversations.</p> <p>The ultimate aim is to take a data-driven approach that will harness the kind of energy seen in the Black Lives Matter movement to achieve political change in local communities. Prosecutors in Cleveland and Chicago who drew criticism for their handling of fatal police shootings of African Americans were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/16/black-lives-matter-movement-midwest-elections-victories\">defeated earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>In August, Angela Corey, a state attorney in the Jacksonville area who was behind a number of harsh sentences and <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/is-angela-corey-the-cruelest-prosecutor-in-america/\">did not get a conviction</a> in the George Zimmerman case, lost her GOP primary to a relative unknown.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna win some of these races around the country, we\u2019re gonna lose some. What we will change is that district attorneys will no longer get a free pass. For far too long, district attorneys could go off and do whatever they want, they could decide they were going to serve the police alone and not the community, they were just going to serve moneyed interests and not the wider community,\u201d Robinson said. </p> <p>A study last year found that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/us/a-study-documents-the-paucity-of-black-elected-prosecutors-zero-in-most-states.html\">95% of elected prosecutors</a> in the US were white.</p> <p>Success, Robinson said, will be a shift in the balance of power that makes elected officials \u201cnervous about disappointing black people\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Portsmouth in Virginia, and on the recording of a 911 call, a man is reported to have been shoplifting at Walmart.

First-degree murder say Chapman\u2019s family and the prosecutor (this is one of the rare cases that ends up in court). Over 90 minutes, <strong>This World: Unarmed Black Male</strong> (BBC2) forensically unpicks the case from that car park \u2013 a young man lying in a widening sea of blood, and a mum at home who does not yet know her boy is gone \u2013 to a verdict in the case against Rankin. The documentary makers are secured access to Chapman\u2019s family, and also to Rankin himself, who talks. Plus Rankin\u2019s partner and others because the film \u2013 unlike the court case, which can\u2019t \u2013 goes back to before those shots were fired, to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/01/stephen-rankin-military-trained-officer-william-chapman\" title=\"\">first time Rankin fatally shot an unarmed man while on duty</a>.</p> <p>Unarmed Black Male also puts Chapman\u2019s death into the context of a year \u2013 last year \u2013 in which he was just one of 306 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings\" title=\"\">African Americans killed by police</a>.

It does not matter how much you\u2019ve seen some of this footage, it still acts like a Taser to hope itself.</p> <p>So much of Unarmed Black Male is shocking, depressing and sad: the footage; the numbers; the grief of a mother, two mothers, mourning their sons; the anger of a community. And the picture it shows of a country divided by race. Divided to the extent that the witnesses \u2013 a group of (white) construction workers and the (black) Walmart employee who made the 911 call \u2013 see two different events: William Chapman attacking Officer Rankin, and not attacking him, respectively.</p> <p>Rankin was an accident waiting to happen and should not have still been a police officer, says his ex-wife and a former boss. A serious gun enthusiast, he referred to his firearms case as \u201cRankin\u2019s box of vengeance\u201d. But then, judging by this recruitment video you might think that was just the kind of person the Portsmouth police department was after. It\u2019s like a game of Soldier of frigging Fortune, complete with metal-guitar solo, one of the most chilling moments in a chilling film.</p> <p>Possibly even worse is Rankin explaining that what normally happens in these cases is that you get three weeks of administrative leave while they investigate the incident, then you return to work and get a medal for a valorous act if that is appropriate, which it usually is. \u201cThree weeks and a medal,\u201d he says with a little smile. For killing someone.</p> <p>It might make you angry, watching. But James Jones\u2019s absorbing documentary remains objective, open-minded and journalistic, allowing the events and the people to speak for themselves. And it is all the more powerful for that.

There\u2019s no doubt it was a stupid thing for Smith to do, and, yes, if you look at it for what it is, it is Islamophobic. But this story is a distraction.</p> <p>It\u2019s no secret that Islamophobia has been steadily on the rise in the UK, Europe and the US. There\u2019s the relentless hounding of Muslims on the front pages of our national newspapers; Donald Trump has added a Muslim travel ban to his repertoire of racist ideas; and broadcaster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/20/fatima-manji-kelvin-mackenzie-toxic-propaganda-sun-anti-muslim\" title=\"\">Fatima Manji</a> has been directly targeted for wearing a hijab by Sun columnist Kelvin MacKenzie, only to have the press regulator uphold his right to attack her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I would rather be having a discussion about how we tackle violent hate crimes in the UK</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For me, racism is about more than just a drunken idiot such as Smith jabbering into his cameraphone at 5am. It\u2019s institutionalised discrimination, accepted as normal in powerful places such as the media, politics and supposedly independent bodies, that sets the standard of what is acceptable. So why are we spending so much time on Smith\u2019s story?</p> <p>A cynical part of me wonders whether the flames around this debate were fanned by those who wanted to create a greater divide between Muslims and those who have little contact with them. I\u2019ve seen a lot of outrage directed at those \u201cthin-skinned Muslims\u201d, who are&#xa0;upset about Smith drunkenly mocking them. In some articles, it has felt like&#xa0;the story is a thinly veiled way of baiting both Muslims and those who don\u2019t very much care for them, pitting one against the other.</p> <p>On the one hand, it\u2019s played into the hands of those who want to say that Muslims are overly sensitive, that they can\u2019t take a joke and they\u2019re opposed to freedom of speech. On the other, some people are quite understandably upset about Smith\u2019s behaviour, as it can&#xa0;be seen as a continuation of the casual and aggressive Islamophobia that\u2019s increasingly seen in Britain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/nov/02/louis-smith-ban-british-gymnastics\">Louis Smith\u2019s ban?

There\u2019s room for people to say things I find distasteful or offensive, and it\u2019s not going to affect me if a gymnast gets drunk and makes a fool of himself. Just as I don\u2019t take on every troll on social media, I\u2019m not interested in focusing solely on a story that has little to do with the very real and troubling effects of Islamophobia.</p> <p>I would rather be having a discussion about how we tackle violent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/07/hate-surged-after-eu-referendum-police-figures-show\" title=\"\">hate crimes in the UK</a>, how our foreign policy will impact on the war in Syria, and what is going to be done with the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/04/theresa-may-prevent-bill-extremism-security-terrorism\" title=\"\">anti-terror strategy Prevent</a>, which seems to put all Muslims under suspicion. Tackling and resolving some of these issues would help foster understanding, trust and respect between different communities, and that would be a positive step.</p> <p>It has to be said that, since the incident, Smith has done a good thing in trying to reach out and build bridges, visiting mosques and speaking to Muslims. I just can\u2019t help thinking that it\u2019s more necessary for someone like Kelvin MacKenzie to be doing that kind of outreach. After all, when people like him cast aspersions on Muslims, they do so in the sober light of day, in prominent sections of the national media \u2013 and that, to me, is a distraction we really need to be paying more attention to.</p>",
