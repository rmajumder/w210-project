  "<p>It was once a brand synonymous with gold and marble; a sign of guaranteed opulence if not necessarily good taste. Instead, the taint of sexual assault claims and alleged racism hung over the formal opening of the latest building to bear the Trump name: the Republican presidential candidate\u2019s newest hotel in Washington DC.</p> <p>Just 723 short steps along Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, this may be the closest Donald Trump comes to the heart of political power this year, but the glitzy launch was meant to be the highlight of his business calendar. </p> <p>Rooms during inauguration week in January were marketed at up to $500,000 each. During a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/trump-international-hotel-washington-opening-protests\">soft launch</a> in September, Trump ensured wall-to-wall media coverage by using the occasion to finally admit he had been wrong to doubt Barack Obama\u2019s right to American citizenship.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-money-blog/2015/jul/22/donald-trump-net-worth-political-brand\">Donald Trump: a brand in danger or a daring re-invention?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But weeks of political scandal appear to have taken their toll on the brand. During the recent IMF meetings in Washington, usually the busiest week of the year for luxury hotels in the city, rooms could be <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/trumps-d-c-hotel-shows-as-poll-sink-so-does-his-brand.html\">found online at a significant discount</a> compared to its sold-out rivals.</p> <p>While Trump was boasting of the building\u2019s 5ft-thick walls during Wednesday\u2019s ribbon-cutting ceremony, the sound of political protest out on the street could be heard from inside the lobby. Overnight, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star-damaged\">Trump\u2019s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> was destroyed by a vandal with a sledgehammer and pickaxe.</p> <p>The candidate sounded wistful and unusually subdued as he took a break from the campaign trail to attend the launch. \u201cWith the notable exception of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, this is the most coveted location in DC. The best location,\u201d said Trump. </p> <p>Even the struggling campaign\u2019s slogan, \u201cMake America great again\u201d, was watered down, perhaps succumbing to criticism that it implies the country is no longer at its best. \u2018The United States is great. Its people are great,\u201d said Trump, during brief political remarks that followed the launch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6890c7cbf84098146c141c4526eefc3278754933\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6890c7cbf84098146c141c4526eefc3278754933/269_0_3020_1812/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump, Donald Trump, Melania Trump, Tiffany Trump and Ivanka Trump cut the ribbon at the new Trump International Hotel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump, Donald Trump, Melania Trump, Tiffany Trump and Ivanka Trump cut the ribbon at the new Trump International hotel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Cameron/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy theme today is five [sic] words: \u2018under budget and ahead of schedule\u2019,\u201d added Trump. \u201cYou don\u2019t hear those words too much within government, but you will. This is what I want to do for our country.\u201d</p> <p> Ivanka Trump, whose name has been attached to both the hotel\u2019s spa and its flagship suite over two floors of the bell tower, also sounded worn down by the steady stream of attacks. \u201cThis political season has been one of the most interesting journeys of my life,\u201d said Trump\u2019s daughter. \u201cEach day I have heard critics attempt to deride my father\u2019s business. But one of the most telling things is the thousands of people who have worked with him who continue stand by his side.\u201d</p> <p> Eric Danziger, chief executive of the family\u2019s hotel business, insisted the group was still meeting internal projections. \u201cThis has been a very rewarding year for Trump hotels. Our business continues to exceed our targets,\u201d he said. But he somewhat spoiled the attempt to put a brave face on signs of commercial backlash by confirming <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/travel/donald-trump-hotels-new-name-scion.html\">recent reports</a> that the next hotel venture would not bear the family name and would instead be called \u201cScion hotels\u201d. </p> <p>In Manhattan, the many buildings that bear Trump\u2019s name have become a magnet for middle fingers from passing motorists, with <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-name-snap-story.html\">reports of dumped dog excrement and hurled eggs</a>. Management of one apartment complex has refused requests from residents for Trump\u2019s name to be removed, citing cost and the risk of being sued.</p> <p>The election had already been costly for the Trump brand. Early on, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/nbc-cuts-business-ties-donald-trump-over-immigration-remarks-n383856\">NBC severed ties</a> over Trump\u2019s immigration remarks. Macy\u2019s dumped his menswear line. There have been attempts to remove his name from hotel projects from the Middle East to Canada. </p> <p>But the combination of weeks of sexual assault allegations \u2013 all vigorously denied by Trump \u2013 and plummeting poll numbers mean the hotel launch comes at a particularly bad time.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll build a wall against racism and bigotry,\u201d read a banner on display outside the main entrance as an army of political reporters descended beforehand. \u201cThis is not really a hotel; this is a symbol of Trump\u2019s political ambition,\u201d claimed Eugene Puryear, a protester with the <a href=\"http://www.answercoalition.org/\">Answer Coalition</a>. \u201cThis is another opportunity for Trump to create this myth about his so-called business prowess.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95071dba3172b7f022f69e7b2c7fb818c08f9846\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95071dba3172b7f022f69e7b2c7fb818c08f9846/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators gather outside of the Trump International Hotel in Washington on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators gather outside of the Trump International Hotel in Washington on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zach Gibson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Washington is not a Republican city. Trump received just 391 votes in the DC primary convention and could come third in the city in November\u2019s general election. The hotel launch was boycotted by the city\u2019s Democratic mayor and local restaurateurs.</p> <p>But hotels are aimed at visitors. A characterful building on a national thoroughfare neglected by commercial developers, the Old Post Office could have provided a bit of harmless glitz to a city where opulence typically tends toward understatement. Instead, the acres of marble, chintzy carpet and gleaming gold taps on the inside feel like any other US luxury hotel, while the giant Trump sign on the outside simply invites uncomfortable associations.</p> <p>How many reporters would have been here for any other hotel launch is hard to tell, but the press pack easily exceeded the 225 seats laid out for invited guests. Several of these were filled by family members: Melania, Donald Jr, Eric and Ivanka. </p> <p>Officially, it was not a campaign event, but two of the handful of prominent Republicans still prepared to be associated with the candidacy were there as well, in the former House speaker Newt Gingrich and Alabama senator Jeff Sessions. Gingrich rejected criticism that the event was a distraction from the campaign: \u201cThat\u2019s because they don\u2019t understand the message,\u201d he said, before echoing Trump: \u201cIt\u2019s under budget and ahead of schedule \u2026 it tells you what a Trump administration would be like.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWashington will never be the same\u201d is the defiant slogan of the hotel\u2019s management, which seems determined to milk the waning political connections. What John F Kennedy would make of the 713 sq ft room in his name is harder to judge.</p>",

When combined with the disappointing numbers from Apple, it is clear to see why markets remain under pressure. </p> <p>At least oil prices have stabilised, with the weekly crude inventories providing their usual burst of volatility.

This would allow him to borrow for investment and to provide support for the \u201cjust managing\u201d families (as Theresa May calls them) who will be squeezed by the continuing benefits freeze.</p> <p>Alternatively, should Hammond merely delay Osborne\u2019s surplus target by a year (to 2020-21), he would be forced to impose an additional \u00a39bn of tax rises or spending cuts. Were he to reject any further fiscal tightening, a surplus would not be achieved until 2023-24 - too late to be politically relevant. </p> <p>The most logical option, as the Resolution Foundation concludes, is for Hammond to target a current surplus. But since entering office, both he and May have emphasised their continuing commitment to fiscal conservatism (\u201cHe talks about austerity \u2013 I call it living within our means,\u201d the latter told Jeremy Corbyn at her first PMQs). For Hammond to abandon the goal of the UK\u2019s first budget surplus since 2001-02 would be a defining moment.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/georgeeaton/status/791214137846140928\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Will Hammond embrace Balls&#39;s stance or just soften Osborne&#39;s?

  "<p>Last winter First Unitarian Congregational Society in Brooklyn, where I serve as senior minister, voted to hang a Black Lives Matter banner outside our building. Shortly after we hung the banner it mysteriously disappeared. We replaced it and the replacement disappeared as well. This kept happening. For months the thief was silent; there was no inkling of motive. Every Monday we would post a banner or sign, and every Sunday night, it would be removed. Then, last week, we found something new: next to the Black Lives Matter sign appeared a sign that read: \u201cBlue Lives Matter.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the history of oppressed groups demanding equality, an equivalent of the 'Blue Lives Matter' sign goes up every time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a pastor, I first need to acknowledge the pain behind this protest of our protest. Someone who loves a police officer (or who <em>is</em> a police officer) feels under attack. Indeed, police are killed in the line of duty \u2013 most recently the tragedy in Palm Springs that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/three-police-officers-shot-palm-springs-california\">killed two officers</a>, one about to retire and the other a new mother just back from maternity leave. Police have dangerous jobs \u2013 willingly undertaken \u2013 and deserve great honor and gratitude for their service. We would all agree with the sign, that the lives of police matter. </p> <p>Except that it\u2019s not that simple. To post a \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d sign next to \u2013 and in response to \u2013 a Black Lives Matter sign is not only to equate importance of police and black lives, it is to equate the <em>need</em> for the two signs. It is to say that the value of police officers\u2019 lives needs proclamation just as urgently as that of black lives at this moment in history. It is to suggest that police as a class are targets of discrimination, humiliation, and violence on a par with people of color. To suggest this is to muddy the waters. There is no comparison. One third of all policemen are not incarcerated at some point in their lifetime; police do not earn wages 26% lower than their non-police counterparts; police do not need to sit their sons down for \u201cthe talk\u201d, praying desperately that they be safe from police violence \u2026 unless, of course, their sons are black.</p> <p>It is a central function of a democracy to protect the rights of the oppressed and the disenfranchised. But our ability to do that hinges on our ability to know \u2013 who exactly <em>are</em> the oppressed and disenfranchised? And who are the powerful? In this political season, when a straight, white, male billionaire can claim with a straight face that the system is rigged against him, it can be hard to know. And so the Black Lives Matter movement is shining a spotlight on the particular horror of racism today \u2013 especially the disproportionate violence inflicted on black men by the law enforcement and criminal justice systems. </p> <p>Look at the history of oppressed groups demanding equality, and you find that an equivalent of the \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d sign goes up every time. No sooner was gay marriage affirmed by the supreme court than \u201creligious freedom\u201d bills sprung up nationwide protecting anti-gay discrimination. No sooner were Jim Crow laws were abolished than New York State passed mandatory minimum sentencing for the possession of <em>certain</em> drugs. No sooner did we nominate the first woman candidate for president than we nominated the most flaming misogynist ever to run. These are not coincidences. They are classic backlash, sometimes violent, but often couched in genteel rhetoric that positions the dominant group as the <em>actual</em> victim. It is this false appropriation of victimhood that is most insidious. It gaslights the entire nation. It re-silences people just as they come out of silence. </p> <p>We took down the \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d sign. And it was not because police lives don\u2019t matter. It was because this movement is not about police lives or any other worthy lives that also matter. It is specifically about the lives of black people \u2013 black mothers and fathers and children, teachers and attorneys, prisoners and the homeless, and yes, black police officers. To proclaim that these lives matter is to try to still the shifting sands for just a moment; to utter one simple, unassailable truth on behalf of those whose truths have been pulled out from under their feet time and again.</p>",

Why are they doing it? Is it just a masochistic love of queueing, and being seen to display your right to be on the plane? Not quite. Those people barging to the front are the ones with items of wheeled \u201ccarry on\u201d luggage the size of Smart cars. They want to get them in the overhead lockers. If you\u2019re not quick getting on a plane these days you\u2019ll find the overhead lockers are taken up by these monsters and your bag will have to be crushed against your legs. A pain on long-haul.</p> <p>So it won\u2019t be long before Ryanair and EasyJet offer a new way of paying: reserved overhead luggage lockers at, shall we say, 30 quid a flight?

Guinness World Records and Bruce Springsteen\u2019s autobiography Born to Run, both published in September, were in second and third place respectively.</p> <p>Strong sales were also seen last week for Ladybird\u2019s host of Super Thursday titles, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/12/ladybird-the-dad-review-zoe-williams\">a parody of its children\u2019s books</a> from the 60s and 70s which include How It Works: The Cat and How It Works: The Grandparent, while Phil Collins\u2019s memoir Not Dead Yet took eighth place in the hardback nonfiction charts with sales of almost 8,000 copies.</p> <p>The YouTubers will be facing stiff competition if they are to hang on to their top spot until Christmas, however: the Bookseller <a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/news/sidemen-smash-super-thursday-girl-train-trundles-417001\">points out</a> that \u201cthe festive season is a marathon, not a sprint\u201d, and although last year\u2019s Super Thursday No 1 was also a book by YouTube stars, Dan &amp; Phil\u2019s The Amazing Book is Not on Fire, Bill Bryson\u2019s travelogue The Road to Little Dribbling emerged as the overall bestselling Super Thursday release, with the Christmas No 1 spot eventually taken by Ladybird\u2019s parody <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/22/ladybird-guide-to-the-husband-tops-christmas-bestseller-list\">guide to the husband</a>. \u201cVeteran chart-hanger (and five-time Christmas No 1) Jamie may just be biding his time,\u201d predicted the magazine.</p> <p>And the gamers will also be contending with another YouTube star for the top spot - Zoella, aka Zoe Sugg, who publishes the third instalment in her bestselling novel series, Girl Online: Going Solo, in November. Sugg, a fashion and beauty vlogger, saw her debut novel Girl Online become the fastest selling debut novel ever in 2014, racking up sales of more than 78,000 copies in a week but drawing controversy over its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/08/zoella-bestselling-girl-online-written-siobhan-curham-zoe-sugg\">lack of acknowledgment of its ghostwrite</a>r. Sugg subsequently said that she would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/apr/27/zoella-goes-it-alone-with-girl-online-2-zoe-sugg\">write its sequel alone</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The latest Black Mirror series from Charlie Brooker presents, despite its transition to Netflix, another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/25/reflections-on-black-mirror-by-those-for-whom-science-fiction-became-reality\">unsettling collection of future shock nightmares</a> drawn from consumer technology and social media trends. The second episode, Playtest, has an American tourist lured to a British game development studio to test a new augmented-reality horror game that engages directly with each player\u2019s brain via a biorobotic implant. The AI program mines the character\u2019s darkest fears and manifests them into the real-world as photorealistic graphics. Inevitably, terror and mental breakdown follow.</p> <p>The idea of a video game that can analyse a player\u2019s personality and change accordingly may seem like the stuff of outlandish sci-fi to some Black Mirror viewers. </p> <p>But it isn\u2019t. This could well be where game design is heading.</p> <h2>The game that judges you</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ef7dcc572c9535505e50c44958708e0578d3d68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ef7dcc572c9535505e50c44958708e0578d3d68/0_21_720_432/500.jpg\" alt=\"Horror game Silent Hill: Shattered Memories presents players with psychological profile, then changes content according to the results\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Horror game Silent Hill: Shattered Memories presents players with psychological profile, then changes content according to the results</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Konami</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eight years ago, video game writer Sam Barlow had a new idea about how to scare the crap out of video game players. Working on the survival horror adventure <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/feb/14/silent-hill-shattered-memories-review\">Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</a>, Barlow introduced a character named Dr Kaufmann, a psychotherapist whose role, ostensibly, was to evaluate the mental wellbeing of protagonist Harry Mason. </p> <p>But that\u2019s not really why he was there. Dr Kaufmann\u2019s actual role was to psychologically assess the player. </p> <p>At key points throughout the terrifying narrative, the game provided a questionnaire inspired by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits\">the \u201cBig Five\u201d personality test</a>, a method used by academic psychologists for personality research. Players would be asked things like: Are you a private person? Do you always listen to other people\u2019s feelings? In this way it was building a psychological profile of the player. At the same time, the system was also drawing data from how players interacted with the game world: how long they spent exploring each area before moving on; whether they strayed from clearly marked paths; whether they faced non-player characters while they talked. Every action had an effect on the narrative.</p> <p>\u201cMost scenes in the game had layers of variation \u2013 in the textures and colour, the lighting and the props,\u201d explains Barlow. \u201cCharacters also had multiple appearances and personality differences. All phone calls, voicemails and readable materials had multiple variations according to different profile slices. As you approached a door to a new room, the game was spooling in the assets, testing your profile and loading up the custom asset packages to assemble your own version.\u201d </p> <p>The idea was to draw in and then unsettle the player as much as possible based on their psychological traits. Characters, monsters and environments would all be subtly changed to reflect their own fears of aggression, enclosure or darkness. </p> <p>It was a personalised nightmare.</p> <p>Game designers have been attempting to learn, assess and react to player types since the days of Dungeons and Dragons. Richard Bartle, co-creator of the original MUD roleplaying game, formed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types\">a taxonomy of players</a> in 1996, and his types \u2013 Achievers, Explorers, Socialisers, and Killers \u2013 have often been often used by designers to try to pre-empt and entice different player types. <br></p> <p>Over the last decade, however, the concept of truly reactive \u201cplayer modelling\u201d, in which the game learns in real time from each individual player, has become an important part of academic research into artificial intelligence and machine learning. In 2004, AI researchers Georgios Yannakakis and John Hallam published<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.60.6629&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\"> a seminal paper</a> detailing their work on Pac-Man. They created a modified version of the popular arcade game with the ghosts controlled by an evolutionary neural network that adjusted their behaviour based on each player\u2019s individual strategies. In the same year, PhD student Christian Thurau presented <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.551.2301&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">his own player modelling system</a> that used pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to teach AI characters how to move in a game world, based on watching humans play Quake II.</p> <p>In short: games were beginning to watch and learn from players.</p> <p>Many other other studies followed. In 2007, researchers at the University of Alberta\u2019s Intelligent Reasoning Critiquing and Learning group (under Vadim Bulitko) developed <a href=\"http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AIIDE/2007/AIIDE07-008.pdf\">PaSSAGE (Player-Specific Stories via Automatically Generated Events)</a>, an AI-based interactive storytelling system that could observe and learn from player activities in a role-playing adventure. As the game progressed, the program sorted players into five different types (based on the <a href=\"http://www.sjgames.com/robinslaws/\">Robin\u2019s Laws of Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>) and then served them game events from a library of pre-written mini-missions. If they seemed to like looking for items in the game world, they were given a quest to find an object; if they liked fighting, they were given events that involved combat.</p> <h2>Super Mario gets personal</h2> <p>That system was interesting (and is still being evolved in the department), but it relied on hand-designed set-piece events, and only had a limited grasp on who the player was. Matthew Guzdial, a PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s School of Interactive Computing, is currently working on a more adaptable evolution of this concept \u2013 a version of Nintendo\u2019s Super Mario Bros platformer that features a neural network capable of <a href=\"http://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/418041/georgia-tech-researchers-train-computer-create-games-watching-youtube\">observing player actions and builds novel new level designs</a>, based on this data.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve successfully been able to demonstrate that the generator creates levels that match a learned play style\u201d, says Guzdial who collaborated with Adam Summerville from the University of California, Santa Cruz. \u201cPut simply, if a player likes exploring, it creates levels that must be explored; if a player speed-runs, it makes levels that are suited to speed-runing.\u201d</p> <p>Super Mario, it turns out, is a popular test-bed for AI researchers. It\u2019s familiar, it allows lots of different player actions in a constrained environment, and its source code is easily available. At the University of Copenhagen, AI researchers Noor Shaker, Julian Togelius and the aforementioned Yannakakis developed a slightly different experiment based on the game. This time players were asked to provide emotional feedback on each play-through, giving scores for fun, challenge and frustration; this input was combined with data drawn from watching them play (how often the player jumped, ran or died, how many enemies they killed, etc), and the AI program constructed new levels as a result.</p> <p>Over the last decade, Yannakakis and colleagues over at the University of Malta\u2019s Institute of Digital Games, where he currently works as an associate professor, have explored various forms of machine learning to estimate a player\u2019s behavioural, cognitive and emotional patterns during play. They have combined deep-learning algorithms, which build general models of player experience from massive datasets, with sequence-mining algorithms, which learn from sequences of player actions (like continually choosing health pick-ups over ammo). They have also explored preference learning, which allow an AI system to learn from player choices between particular content types (for example, preferring levels with lots of jumping challenges over those with lots of enemies). </p> <p>Not only have they used behavioural data gathered during play, they\u2019ve also used age, gender and other player details to inform their systems. Their aim isn\u2019t just to make interesting games, however \u2013 the AI techniques they\u2019re exploring may well be used in educational software or as diagnostic or treatment tools in mental health care.</p> <p>\u201cGiven a good estimate of a player\u2019s experience, AI algorithms can automatically \u2013 or semi-automatically \u2013 procedurally generate aspects of a game such as levels, maps, audio, visuals, stories, or even game rules,\u201d says Yannakakis. \u201cThe estimate can be used to help designers shape a better experience for the player. By tracking their preferences, goals and styles during the design process, AI can assist and inspire designers to create better, more novel, more surprising game content.\u201d</p> <p>For Julian Togelius, one of the foremost experts on AI games research now based at NYU, the next step is active player modelling \u2013 he envisages an AI level designer that doesn\u2019t just react to inputs, but is actually curious about the player and their preferences, and wants to find out more. </p> <p>\u201cThere is this machine learning technique called active learning, where the learning algorithm choses which training examples to work on itself,\u201d he explains. \u201cUsing this technique, you could actually have a game that chooses in what way to explore you, the player: the game is curious about you and wants to find out more, therefore serving you situations where it does not know what you will do. That\u2019s something that will be interesting for the player too, because the game has a reasonably good model of what you\u2019re capable of and will create something that\u2019s novel and interesting to you.\u201d</p> <h2>The games that feels your emotions</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e2e5d7001d3d4b1dcf27685e2e550c3c13c8f0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e2e5d7001d3d4b1dcf27685e2e550c3c13c8f0c/0_48_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Left 4 Dead games feature an AI Director that alters enemy types and threat levels depending on player actions\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Left 4 Dead games feature an AI Director that alters enemy types and threat levels depending on player actions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valve Software</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, in many ways we\u2019re already seeing this kind of player modelling happening in the conventional games industry. Valve\u2019s critically acclaimed zombie shooter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/dec/02/left4dead-review-xbox-pc\">Left 4 Dead </a>features an AI director that varies the type and threat level of undead enemies based on player activities in the game so far. With the arrival of free-to-play digital games on social media platforms and mobile phones, we also saw the emergence of a whole new game design ethos based on studying player data and iterating games accordingly. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/dec/02/facebook-games-zynga-ipo\">In its prime</a>, Zynga was famed for its huge data science department that watched how players interacted with titles such as Farmville and Mafia Wars, worked out where they were getting bored or frustrated, and tweaked the gameplay to iron out those kinks. The analysis of player metrics quickly became a business in itself with companies such as Quantic Foundry and GameAnalytics set up to help smartphone developers garner information from the activities of players.</p> <p>But these systems are commercially motivated and based around making game design bets on the activities of thousands of players \u2013 they\u2019re not about actually understanding players on an individual emotional level. </p> <p>That concept is definitely coming. Some AI researchers are shifting away from machine learning projects that watch what players do and toward systems that work out what they feel. It\u2019s possible to get an idea about a player\u2019s excitement, engagement or frustration from analysing certain in-game actions \u2013 is the player hammering the jump button, are they avoiding or engaging enemies, are they moving slowly or quickly? Simple actions can give away a lot about the player\u2019s state of mind. In 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/jan/21/artificial-intelligence-ai-game\">Julian Togelius</a> found he was able to make informed assumptions about key character traits of test subjects by watching how they played Minecraft. \u201cWe asked them questions about their life motives then analysed the logs from the game,\u201d he says. \u201cTraits like independence and curiosity very strongly correlated with lots of things that happened in the game.\u201d</p> <p>So could an AI program study that data and change a game to tweak those feelings? \u201cThe major challenge is to relate content and [player] behaviour to emotion,\u201d says Noor Shaker, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen who completed a PhD in player-driven procedural content generation. \u201cUltimately, we want to be able to identify the aspects of games that have an impact on how players experience them.\u201d</p> <p>Shaker is using a variety of methods for this purpose: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/09/the-ancient-origins-of-conciousness-todd-feinberg-and-john-mallet-review\">neuroevolution</a>, random decision forests, multivariate adaptive spline models are all complex machine learning toolsets that enable neural networks to gradually learn from and adapt to different player behaviours. </p> <p>\u201cMy work recently revolves around building more accurate models of experience, implementing interactive tools that allow us to visualise the expressive space of players\u2019 emotions,\u201d says Shaker. \u201cMost of the work I have seen so far, such as adaptation in Left 4 Dead, focuses on game difficulty and adjusting the behaviour of the NPCs according to relatively simple metrics of player\u2019s behaviour. I believe there are many other aspects to experience than difficulty and there are many more elements that can be considered to manipulate player experience than the behaviour of the NPCs. Recent research has shown that emotions such as frustration, engagement and surprise can be detected and modelled by machine learning methods.</p> <p>Shaker then, is interested in developing a video game AI system that understands not just how the player plays, but how the player is feeling as they play. Imagine a game that learns a player\u2019s emotional state and generates non-player characters and story fragments that it knows will hit them right in the heart. \u201cI believe data-driven automatic content personalisation is doable,\u201d says Shaker.<br></p> <h2>The game that stalks you</h2> <p>So far, much of this research has concentrated on how the player behaves within the game world. But that\u2019s not the only place to gather data. As consumers in the digital era, we\u2019re used to being profiled by major corporations: Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Google all use behavarioural targeting techniques to serve personalised ads and content to users. Advanced algorithms track our web-browsing activities via cookies and web beacons and learn our preferences. The data is all out there, and there\u2019s no reason why games makers couldn\u2019t use it too.<br></p> <p>In fact, AI researchers are already creating games that mine information from popular websites and bring it back for use in the narrative. Gabriella Barros is working on the concept of \u201cdata adventures\u201d with Julian Togelius, in which the AI gathers information from sites like Wikipedia and OpenStreetMaps to create globe-trotting point-and-click adventures in the style of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_in_the_World_Is_Carmen_Sandiego%3F_(1985)\">Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego</a><strong> </strong>\u2013 except they\u2019re based in real locations and populated by real people. These data games are just the beginning, argues Michael Cook an AI researcher at Falmouth University.</p> <p>\u201cRight now they\u2019re interested in huge, open data platforms like Wikipedia or government statistics,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you can imagine in the future a game which takes your Facebook feed instead of a Wikipedia database, and populates the game world with people you know, the things they like doing, the places they visit and the relationships people have with one another. Whether or not that sounds like a scary idea is another question, but I can definitely see it as a natural extension of [the data game concept]. We already open our lives up to so many companies every day, we might as well get a bespoke, commissioned video game out of the deal.\u201d</p> <p>Copenhagen\u2019s Noor Shaker points out that privacy issues are a bottleneck with social media data \u2013 but then it\u2019s a bottleneck that Google and co have deftly circumnavigated. \u201cOnce we have the data, and depending on the source and type, natural language processing methods such as sentiment analysis could be used to profile and cluster players according to their opinion about different social, cultural or political matters,\u201d she says. \u201cStatistics could also be collected about games, books, or songs they already purchased, liked or expressed opinion about. All this information could feed powerful machine learning methods such as neural networks or standard classification techniques that learn profiles, discover similarity or predict personality traits.\u201d<br></p> <p>So now we\u2019re getting closer to the Black Mirror concept. Imagine something like The Sims, where the pictures on your apartment walls are photos from your Facebook wall, where neighbours are your real-life friends. Or, on a darker tangent, imagine a horror adventure that knows about your relationships, your Twitter arguments, your political views; imagine a horror game that knows what you watch on YouTube. \u201cIt is only natural to expect that game data can be fused with social media activity to better profile players and provide a better gaming experience,\u201d says Yannakakis. </p> <h2>The game that reads your mind \u2013 and body</h2> <p>Researchers can envisage a game that builds a detailed psychological and social profile of a player, from both their in-game actions and online footprint \u2013 but there\u2019s still a gap between this, and the horror game posited in Black Mirror, which performs an invasive neurological hack on the player. </p> <p>Brain-computer interfacing of this sort is still the stuff of bleeding edge medical research and science fiction. However, we\u2019re already seeing the use of devices \u2013 both in research and in consumer production \u2013 that can measure physiological states such as skin conductance and heart-rate variability to assess a player\u2019s emotional reaction to game content. </p> <p>Konami\u2019s 1997 arcade dating game Oshiete Your Heart, for example, featured a sensor that measured the player\u2019s heart rate and skin conductance to influence the outcome of each romantic liaison. <a href=\"http://www.flyingmollusk.com/nevermind/\">Nevermind</a>, released by by Flying Mollusk last year, is a biofeedback-enhanced horror adventure that increases the level of challenge based on the player\u2019s stress readings. Yannakakis and other researchers are also using off-the-shelf smart camera technologies like <a href=\"http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.html\">Intel RealSense</a> and the emotion recognition software <a href=\"http://www.affectiva.com/\">Affectiva</a> to track a player\u2019s facial expressions and monitor their heartbeat \u2013 both indicators of a variety of emotions. Noor Shaker has studied how tracking a player\u2019s head pose while they take part in a game can tell us about the experience they\u2019re having. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/187755518\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/187755518\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Right now, these physiological inputs are mostly confined to research departments, but that may change. Valve, the company behind games like Portal and Half-Life and the HTC Vive VR headset has been experimenting with biometric inputs for years. Founder <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-valve-biometrics-blog-entry\">Gabe Newell predicted in 2011</a> that we would one day see game controllers with built in heart-rate and skin response detectors. A game supported by these sensors could easily present each player with different items, concepts or options to gauge a heart or skin response, adapting content on the fly depending on the reaction. Imagine a VR headset with sensors that measure skin heat response and heart rate. People are already <a href=\"https://diyhacking.com/digitising-human-emotions-virtual-reality/\">hacking this sort of thing together</a>.</p> <h2>The game that loves you</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_edkWos2BY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A_edkWos2BY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>This all sounds terrifying, but it needn\u2019t be used in the way the Black Mirror episode does. There are benevolent, perhaps even beautiful, possibilities in the idea of games learning from players. One company looking into this potential is Mobius AI, a New York and UK-based starup developing a cognitive AI engine for developers. Co-founder Dr Mitu Khandaker-Kokoris is more interested in the potential relationships that could occur between players and AI characters who have the ability to identify and learn from individual players. </p> <p>\u201cWhat games really lack is that serendipitous kind of connection we feel when we meet someone in the real world that we get along with,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of the ways this will happen is through games featuring AI-driven characters who truly understand us, and what we as individual players are expressing through the things we are actually saying and doing in the game.</p> <p>\u201cImagine, for instance, that you were the only one in the world who an AI-driven character could trust fully because the game could infer that you have similar personalities. This character could then take you down a unique experience, which only you have access to. It\u2019s a fascinating problem space, and a great challenge to think about how games could truly work you out \u2013 or rather, who you are pretending to be \u2013 by paying attention to not only what you\u2019re saying, but how you\u2019re saying it.\u201d</p> <p>Interestingly, Khandaker-Kokoris, who is also working on procedural storytelling game <a href=\"http://www.littleinvasiontales.com/\">Little Invasion Tales</a>, is more skeptical about the role of personal data mining in the future of game design. \u201cWe play games, often, to be someone who would have a different online history than our own,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then, we are partly always ourselves, too. We have to work out what it would mean in terms of role-play and the idea of a permeable magic circle.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s certain though, is that game creators and AI researchers are moving in the same direction: toward systems that provide content based on individual player preferences and activities.

  "<p>Activists have called on Canadian leaders to introduce concrete policies to confront discrimination against women and girls after the country fell from first to 25th in the United Nation\u2019s gender equality ranking.</p> <p>The criticism comes as the United Nations holds its 65th annual meeting to eliminate gender discrimination, and just a few months after the country\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, was praised for a speech to the UN in New York, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/mar/17/justin-trudeau-im-going-to-keep-calling-myself-a-feminist-video\">where he said, \u201cI am a feminist.\u201d</a><br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/mar/17/justin-trudeau-im-going-to-keep-calling-myself-a-feminist-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4hk78\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2475152\"            data-video-name=\"Justin Trudeau: I\u2019m going to keep calling myself a feminist - video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56eadd58e4b06837afd3e4dc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11331498&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11331498&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11331498&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11331498&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11331498&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/mar/17/justin-trudeau-im-going-to-keep-calling-myself-a-feminist-video\">Justin Trudeau: I\u2019m going to keep calling myself a feminist</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cCanada fails to respect, protect and fulfill the social and economic rights of women and girls,\u201d a group of 14 non-profit organizations said in a statement. \u201cToo many women in Canada experience poverty, homelessness, insecure housing, woefully inadequate social assistance incomes, food insecurity and other violations of the right to an adequate standard of living.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The groups, which include Amnesty International, the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada and Oxfam, pointed to Trudeau\u2019s comments on gender equality and his pledges to improve relations with the country\u2019s indigenous population.</p> <p>\u201cCanada has a new federal government with a Prime Minister who says he is a feminist, calls for a nation-to-nation relationship, and acknowledges that \u2018poverty is sexist\u2019. We know words matter, but now we need action,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>Historically, the United Nations\u2019 work toward gender equality has included an annual <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/gender-inequality-index-gii\">Gender Inequality Index</a>, an international ranking in which Canada has steadily fallen. In 1995, Canada held the top spot, but has fallen to 25th over the last 20 years. </p> <p>The report includes data on reproductive health, empowerment and economic inclusion. The GII uses maternal death rates and teen pregnancy, the number of women who hold national elected office and have secondary education, and participation in the labor market to weigh countries\u2019 progress toward equality. </p> <p>In their criticism of Canada, the groups said they were \u201cconcerned\u201d about access to abortion, \u201cparticularly in rural and northern areas\u201d, and said they were dismayed by the country\u2019s continued wage gap between the sexes and even between women.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking to the new government that\u2019s taken over, who has made lots of promises around women\u2019s equality,\u201d said Kasari Govender, executive director of the West Coast Women\u2019s Legal Education and Action Fund (Leaf). \u201cAre they actually going to truly act on the damage that has been done over the last couple decades that have eroded women\u2019s equality?\u201d </p> <p>Govender pointed to what she said was a 12% wage disparity between women with children and those without, what she called a \u201cmotherhood tax\u201d, as well as difficulties women face finding childcare. </p> <p>The groups were especially critical of the Canadian government\u2019s failure to serve the needs of indigenous women. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/21/canada-politics-progressive-liberal-trudeau\">Think Canada is a progressive paradise?

But <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/is-justin-trudeau-a-fake-feminist/\">some activists have argued</a> that the prime minister\u2019s policy proposals have yet to overcome more complex systematic sexism, such as federal budget proposals that favored male-dominated industries.</p> <p>For example, the government recently <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-liberals-killed-a-bill-promoting-gender-parity-in-politics-they-were-wrong/\">failed to pass a bill</a> that would have financially penalized political parties for failing to run near-equal slates of male and female candidates. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe were more cautiously optimistic a few months ago,\u201d said Armine Yalnizyan, senior economist for the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, a group not affiliated with the activists that called on Canadian leaders to enact more meaningful legislation.<strong> </strong>\u201cIt has been a year, and there has not been much action other than the appointment of women to cabinet.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The authors of the statement said there remains, \u201ca significant implementation gap between Canada\u2019s human rights obligations for women and their realization within domestic laws, policies and programs.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cIt is time for our federal government to take leadership and work with provinces and territories to implement the [UN convention against discrimination].\u201d</p>"
