  "<p>David Cameron was unequivocal. \u201cThe military,\u201d he said. \u201cThe military is definitely one sector where I don\u2019t see black people represented at the top.\u201d That was four years ago, and the former prime minister was talking to me about the sectors of society in which he felt people of African or African Caribbean heritage were most conspicuous by their absence.</p> <p>He had been spot-on in identifying the military; there are very few black faces in the senior ranks. Only 2.4% of officers are from a black or minority ethnic background \u2013 and that figure includes recruits from Commonwealth countries. However, he could just as easily have been talking about the civil service, the police or the media and still have been on the money.</p> <p>Six years before that conversation, I launched the <a href=\"http://www.powerlist.co.uk\">Powerlist</a>, an annual publication that profiles some of Britain\u2019s most influential people of African and African Caribbean heritage. Now, 10 years on, as we publish this year\u2019s list, we have found that despite some cause for optimism \u2013 mostly in the business sector \u2013 in many areas the situation is no better than a decade ago, and sometimes worse.</p> <p>Take, for instance, the government. Incredibly, there has never been an MP of African or African Caribbean heritage in the cabinet. The only black cabinet minister was Baroness Amos (a peer) who served in the decision-making body of the executive as secretary of state for international development and leader of the House of Lords between 2003 and 2007. Baroness Scotland, as attorney general, and before her Lord Boateng, as chief secretary to the Treasury, held positions in which the incumbent minister was regularly invited to attend cabinet meetings, but strictly speaking neither of those roles is regarded as being in the cabinet. Today there are no black people in the cabinet.</p> <p>A look at the judiciary shows that 10 years ago Dame Linda Dobbs, who currently chairs the Powerlist judging committee, was the only black high court judge. In 2004, when she was first appointed, she said of the fact that she was the first person of African heritage to fill such a role: \u201cI am confident that I am the first of many to come.\u201d Sadly, that has not been the case. Not only was she the one black high court judge throughout her tenure, but since Dobbs retired in 2013 there has been a total absence of black judges in the high court.</p> <p>Intriguingly, however, there has been a significant shift in representation on the list from the public to the private sector. There are no official data to back this up, but a look at corporate Britain reveals that the number of black people in senior positions has increased over the years \u2013 almost certainly as a result of aggressive diversity programmes instituted by many companies in this sector. In professional services, while the numbers are still far fewer than they ought to be, there are more black partners than ever before. It\u2019s the same in law firms: more black partners have come through over the past decade. And in banking, particularly investment banking, there are more black managing directors than ever.</p> <p>But when we look at board representation in FTSE 100 companies \u2013 the people who make the most important decisions in these firms \u2013 the picture once again turns ugly. There are just two UK-based black people \u2013 Dambisa Moyo, at Barclays and at SAB Miller, and Jean Tomlin at Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 serving on the board of a FTSE 100 firm. Both are non-executives. There are no black c-suite execs (chair, chief executive, chief finance officer etc) \u2013 the people who really run the company. In 2007 there were three, two of whom were executive directors.</p> <p>As our list has clearly shown over the years, this is not due to a paucity of talent. It\u2019s more to do with a lack of opportunities for that talent to shine, with some of the headhunters who have traditionally filled board vacancies particularly culpable because they simply don\u2019t know any black people.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not all bad news. The one area that seems to have thrived, somewhat ironically given the economic climate of the past decade, is the number of black-owned and run businesses that have come through.</p> <p>Ten years ago we struggled to find successful entrepreneurs. Now young people such as 24-year-old Steven Bartlett, who set up Social Chain, one of the UK\u2019s fastest growing social media firms, and former banker Martin Ijaha, the founder and CEO of Neyber, a company that offers affordable loans to company employees, are becoming serious trailblazers in the business sector. And then we have the more established entrepreneurs such as Ric Lewis, whose property investment firm Tristan Capital Partners has \u00a310bn under management, and Tom Ilube, who has set up and sold a number of tech companies. In the arts, Femi Oguns\u2019 Identity Agency Group has been at the forefront of supplying black British acting talent to Hollywood, <em>Star Wars</em> actor John Boyega being one high-profile success.</p> <p>On Tuesday we celebrate the Powerlist\u2019s 10th anniversary at the annual influencers\u2019 dinner, a black-tie event in the City which will feature leading figures in the UK\u2019s African and African Caribbean population as well as guests from the US, Africa and the Caribbean. London mayor Sadiq Khan, will deliver the keynote speech. It has become the most prestigious event in the black British calendar.</p> <p>Ten years on, Powerful Media, the company that publishes the list, has added <a href=\"http://powerful-media.com\">Future Leaders</a>, which profiles 100 of the UK\u2019s most talented black students every year and which has become an invaluable resource for our recruitment firm Powerful Personnel. Through it we work with some of the country\u2019s leading firms to assist them in their efforts to recruit the brightest and best, at all grades of seniority, regardless of their ethnicity.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always said that we will stop publishing the Powerlist when it is no longer necessary. But given the slow rate of change in so many areas of British life, it\u2019s arguably needed more now than ever before.</p> <h2>Corporates, financiers and entrepreneurs</h2> <p><strong>Nathaniel

That was a reality.\u201d</p> <p>His mother wanted him to go the nearby performing arts school, a more promising bet than mainstream school. \u201cOne day she said, \u2018OK, we\u2019re going to make you an actor.\u2019 She got a book out of the library [so I could] learn an entire monologue for an audition.\u201d But on the day, he got stage fright and forgot all his lines.</p> <p>That might have been the end of it, but as he was leaving Underwood saw some girls practising ballet in the next room. \u201cI couldn\u2019t walk out of that building and say to my mum, \u2018I didn\u2019t get that\u2019. That was a no-no.\u2019\u201d Underwood walked in, wearing jeans and a T-shirt, and insisted the teacher give him a go. \u201cI felt like I could be great at this, and that I could change my family\u2019s destiny if I got it right.\u201d The experience was a baptism of fire, with the teacher shouting out specialist dance terms (tomb\u00e9 and gliss\u00e9). \u201cI knew nothing, but I said, \u2018If you show me, I can do it.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b07c4bf631afcd32cd319fe6a86c079a8033a002\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b07c4bf631afcd32cd319fe6a86c079a8033a002/0_1135_5106_3064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eric Underwood\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019ve always thought, \u201cI look great, I can dance, I\u2019ve got some rhythm.

But then this ballet teacher came along and gave me something she couldn\u2019t give me.\u201d The two eventually realised they had a common goal and became friends.</p> <p>Underwood, meanwhile, was absorbed in becoming a better dancer. \u201cI would put my leg up on the bunk bed in my bedroom, stretch and watch videos of The Nutcracker and A Chorus Line over and over again. I was obsessed.\u201d</p> <p>His mother had anxiety issues and then a heart attack, which meant she could no longer work. The household income suffered, \u201cbut where the finances went away, it was replaced by time\u201d. Underwood says: \u201cMy mother was home more, so she\u2019d be able to say, \u2018Eric, let\u2019s do your homework together.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There was fun to be had, too. Every Friday night his mother would gather together the family, make a barbecue dinner, move the furniture and dance around the house to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jan/14/teddy-pendergrass-obituary\">Teddy Pendergrass</a>. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just a Friday night dressed in pyjamas,\u201d Underwood explains. \u201cShe\u2019d come fully dressed. She\u2019s quite a vibrant woman who likes to do things, and this was her way of going out.\u201d</p> <p>At 15, he won the Philip Morris foundation scholarship to the School of American Ballet (\u201cMy mother was like, \u2018Oh, you must be quite good, then\u2019\u201d) and in New York, for the first time in his life, he heard people refer to him as \u201cthe black one\u201d. Did that hurt? \u201cNo. My mother had always told me I was beautiful and amazing. I thought it was their problem. I never felt negative about being black. I\u2019ve always thought, \u2018I look great, I can dance, I\u2019ve got some rhythm. Things are on the up and up! I\u2019m just going to go home, put on some Marvin Gaye and have a blast!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cef560a9cf083b34f7b48dd0c4c801c91ead4f18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cef560a9cf083b34f7b48dd0c4c801c91ead4f18/0_232_4075_4903/831.jpg\" alt=\"Eric Underwood\" width=\"831\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I never felt negative about being black.

He tells me about something that happened on tour in Mississippi: he and Copeland were entering their hotel at the same time as a homeless man was being denied access. The man watched them go in and then screamed, \u201cYou won\u2019t let me in, but you let these fucking niggers in?\u201d Underwood remembers the sense of shock. \u201cI felt singled out and defeated. In that moment, I wasn\u2019t just one of the dancers.\u201d</p> <p>Until recently, ballet shoes for black feet didn\u2019t exist \u2013 the \u201cflesh tone\u201d shoe was always a pale pink or beige \u2013 and Underwood\u2019s pre-show ritual used to include a laborious 45 minutes spent caking his \u201cnude\u201d ballet pumps with dark makeup. Once, in Italy, he failed to find the right makeup and struggled to cover his shoes for a performance. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/5UE6auBFO9/\">I posted an Instagram to some companies</a>, suggesting there should be different coloured shoes. A Russian ballet company replied, saying, \u2018You\u2019re black. You should wear black shoes.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But one major manufacturer, Bloch, responded by creating a line in darker tones, including one co-designed with Underwood, which they call Eric Tan. Underwood has been dancing in them <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BC0vjC3l_B_/\">since March this year</a>.</p> <p>He believes that visibility is the best way to get more diversity in ballet. \u201cIt\u2019s about having ballet on your radar, and it\u2019s important to see people who reflect you doing it. Ballet can be incredibly elitist and expensive. Unless you can afford those luxuries, you don\u2019t see it as being a possibility.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"032b37eb89b6bc66d7c9aa87003578bdc75f66cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/032b37eb89b6bc66d7c9aa87003578bdc75f66cc/0_0_4724_4975/950.jpg\" alt=\"Jumper, trousers and trainers all Polo Ralph Lauren.\" width=\"950\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All clothes by <a href=\"http://ralphlauren.co.uk/\">Polo Ralph Lauren</a>, available from the new flagship store on Regent Street, London.

Out of 60 boys, he identified two whom he thought had real talent. One of the mothers went on to enrol her son in classes, but the other mother was immovable in her view that boys don\u2019t do ballet. \u201cShe said, \u2018His father wants him to play football. He doesn\u2019t dance.\u2019\u201d Underwood shrugs: \u201cPeople ask me why there aren\u2019t more dancers of colour, or boys, and it\u2019s about the parents.\u201d</p> <p>His own father\u2019s reaction to his dancing was positive. \u201cMy father was quite a shy man. He said, \u2018So I hear you\u2019re dancing?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Well, as long as you\u2019re happy\u2019. That was the end of that.\u201d</p> <p>Underwood joined the Royal Ballet in 2006, and in 2008 became a soloist and moved to London; he recently became a British citizen. He says he loves London\u2019s diversity, and now feels like a visitor when he goes back to the States to visit his mother, who has moved to North Carolina. His brother is now a furniture builder and his sister a teacher.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When people are getting shot outside your house, your priorities are different</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Recently, Underwood has begun to look beyond dancing. \u201cI love dancing,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut I want to be able to stop early enough that I can reinvent myself.\u201d Last year, he signed to the same talent agency as Alexa Chung, and has since been photographed by David Bailey (a full-frontal nude for British GQ); <a href=\"http://www.vogue.it/moda/cover-fashion-stories/2016/02/09/laugh-by-mario-testino/\">Testino snapped him with Kate Moss for Italian Vogue</a>, an experience he describes as \u201cin-cre-dible. She knew every angle. It was genius.\u201d</p> <p>He has loved fashion from a young age, and cites model <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Beckford\">Tyson Beckford</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVbQo3IOC_A\">the Fresh Prince</a> as early style icons. \u201cI think of clothing as costume. One day I can be punk, and another I can be Ralph Lauren on a yacht.\u201d Today, he\u2019s wearing a maroon, button-down shirt that\u2019s more normcore than out-and-out fashion. \u201cI\u2019m in a classic look because of work,\u201d he explains.</p> <p>You\u2019d think a lifetime of focusing on his body and what it can do, as both a dancer and a model, would make Underwood self-critical, but he\u2019s too well-adjusted for that. \u201cWhen people are getting shot outside your house, your priorities are different,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not about having a bit of fat under your leg.\u201d</p> <p>But he once described training as \u201cnine hours staring at your faults\u201d, dancing in a room full of mirrors. What does that do to a person? \u201cIt can be a great thing or it can destroy you. I think it\u2019s important to know who you are when you\u2019re looking into that mirror.\u201d </p>",
