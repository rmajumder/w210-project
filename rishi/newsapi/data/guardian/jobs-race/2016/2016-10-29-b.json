Unless one directed by Fellini, script by Nietzsche and Machiavelli, set design by God himself. Which, though I like Aled Jones every bit as much as the next atheist, might make for a beezer of an episode.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/channel/sky-atlantic/the-young-pope\">The Young Pope</a> \u2013</strong> HBO, Canal+ and Sky\u2019s latest multinational piece of \u201cWow. Just\u2026 wow\u201d \u2013 comes courtesy of Italian creator-director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/25/the-young-pope-jude-law-paolo-sorrentino\">Paolo Sorrentino</a>, sometime darling of Cannes and Oscars, and it might just be the most astonishing piece of television to grace our screens this 2016, a year not devoid of contenders. Jude Law plays, with intense and nuanced talent, unseen since <em>Mr Ripley</em> \u2013 I see him on chat shows, used to bump into him in Primrose Hill, and his wry self-deprecation masks a deep gift \u2013 the first American pope, and the youngest ever.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This has captivated and enthralled me to precisely the extent that 20 years of religion never did</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lenny Belardo has been unexpectedly elevated to infallibility, thanks to much politicking behind the puffs of white smoke, and so the Vatican, and the Catholic fifth of the world\u2019s population, is wondering what flavour of pope to expect. As in the Kyrie from Faur\u00e9, he\u2019s darkly ambiguous: will the next God on Earth turn out as benevolent or vindictive, liberal or reactionary, modern or hewn in ancient stone and blood-anger? We are kept waiting for an inordinate time. Lenny \u2013 he takes the more proper if historically ominous title of Pius XIII \u2013 was a foundling orphan, and is a maelstrom of contradictions. A dedicated smoker, intolerant of weakness. Playful and joking, yet cruel, with more than a few barbs. Supremely confident, yet given to black internal monologues. Pope on a mope. At one point he will take his supine priest-confessor high to the Vatican\u2019s rooftops, point out God\u2019s \u201chome\u201d amid the stars. \u201cJust left of the Big Dipper.\u201d What\u2019s it like, begs the monsignor. \u201cHalf of a duplex. Though private swimming pool.\u201d</p> <p>His best jousting is saved for his real enemies, chief among them his secretary of state, Cardinal Voiello, who is patently evil and has an evil mole on his face and schemes and dreams, yet turns out to be a quiet pastoral saint. The new pope helicopters in the nun who raised him \u2013 Diane Keaton, whose wise American face was born to play this part \u2013 to take his right seat, and makes one new friend in Cardinal Gutierrez (Javier C\u00e1mara), who is possessed of a sense of humour. One of the many, many strengths of this is that it allows, through the presence of worldwide cardinals, the presence of phenomenal worldwide actors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b5898e935cbcc473e0a98147e08c8dc8fd881d3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5898e935cbcc473e0a98147e08c8dc8fd881d3d/0_401_3849_2266/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jude Law as Pius XIII with Silvio Orlando as the \u2018patently evil\u2019 Cardinal Voiello in The Young Pope.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"589\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jude Law as Pius XIII with Silvio Orlando as the \u2018patently evil\u2019 Cardinal Voiello in The Young Pope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Gianni Fiorito for Sky Atlantic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And Lenny\u2019s first address to St Peter\u2019s Square? He opens his arms, repeals the thunder: sunshine blisters the adoring crowd. Lenny\u2019s \u2013 Pius XIII\u2019s \u2013 words do worse than blister. \u201cWhat have we forgotten?\u201d he begins, with commanding gusto. \u201cWe have forgotten how to play. How to masturbate. How to use contraceptives. How to get abortions\u2026 how to celebrate gay marriages. To allow priests to love each other, even to get married\u2026 forgotten how to decide to die if we detest living; to divorce; to let nuns say mass. We have forgotten how to <em>play</em>. We have forgotten happiness.\u201d</p> <p>Around the \u201cpriests\u2026 love each other\u2026 get married\u201d bit, three red cardinals faint backwards, plop, like a Terry Gilliam animation, and we realise it\u2019s been a dream sequence. My, and don\u2019t I just hate dream sequences, but this worked.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Black Mirror \u2013\u00a0six new episodes of Charlie Brooker\u2019s psyche \u2013 has honour in its heart yet ashes in its mouth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As did the extraordinary three end minutes. Not a dream. To Schubert\u2019s Ave Maria \u2013 I\u2019m informed by my delightful Shazam app that it\u2019s Cheryl Studer, and it doesn\u2019t get much better \u2013 we panned around fat priests struggling to tie laces, priests getting injections in their buttocks, nuns playing great football \u2013 priests and nuns being insanely human \u2013 and I struggle to recall a better three minutes of film, or of humanity, while the anticipation builds towards the pope\u2019s first address. I\u2019m not giving away a spoiler when I say the second episode ends in a shocker, when Pius/Lenny finally takes to that balcony.</p> <p>You can see all this in two ways. Treat it as a wonderfully vindictive assassination of Catholicism, the power of the Vatican, in a way the chosen faithful seem to be able simultaneously to celebrate and condemn. On a more prosaic level, you could just say: \u201cI\u2019ve just seen the pope\u2019s bum.\u201d (Note to self: this is possibly the sentence I should have opened with. Yes, he showers, naked, within five minutes of the opening episode. Pope on a soap.)</p> <p>But this has captivated and enthralled me with its style and beauty and questions, questions, to precisely the extent that 20 years of religion never did. Perhaps religion should have had better directors.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/70264888\"><strong>Black Mirror </strong></a>\u2013 my goodness, do I really have to review another simply terrifyingly good slab of television \u2013 has honour in its heart yet ashes in its mouth.

The poison talk in which many indulge (I\u2019m bizarrely proud to never log on and thus have 13 followers, one of them a complete dick) leads on to consequences of a most visceral, not to say \u201ckilly\u201d, nature. It\u2019s clever, it\u2019s ripe with thought, it\u2019s ugly. <em>Nosedive</em> takes my second vote: a beautiful pastel pastiche of every American\u2019s dream since the American dream died: it\u2019s not money, it\u2019s popularity. With contact lenses and phones designed to instantly \u201crate\u201d every chuffing thing, America eats itself. <em>Shut Up and Dance</em> \u2013 a simple (and currently do-able) slice of horrific blackmail, with a vigilante (and also horrific) twist.</p> <p><em>San Junipero</em> was lovely, just lovely. What were you thinking, Mr Brooker? Your perfect afterlife? Cyndi Lauper and Robbie Nevil? <em>Playtest</em> \u2013 a horror video game gone <em>so</em> wrong. <em>Men Against Fire</em> \u2013 decent conceit, but hasn\u2019t America been doing this since Vietnam? As usual, Brooker has taken our fine imaginings, bumped them up to 12 on the <em>Spinal Tap </em>scale and made us cry and laugh while bolting our doors. American reactions have included \u201cI\u2019m throwing my smartphone in the bin\u201d. Charlie Brooker can change the world.</p> <p>Jane overchilled her Victorian collar.

She has continued in her role as Clinton\u2019s closest ally on the campaign trail.</p> <p>Once seen as a rising Democratic star, Weiner was forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/16/anthony-weiner-resigns-twitter-scandal\">resign from Congress</a> in 2011 after he sent a picture of his penis, clad in his boxer shorts, to a 21-year-old student via Twitter. After he initially denied involvement in the messages, further pictures sent by Weiner emerged and he stepped down, at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/14/anthony-weiner-barack-obama\">the urging of Barack Obama</a>.</p> <p>A redemptive quest to become mayor of his hometown, New York City, gained traction in 2013, with several polls showing he had a decent chance of beating the longtime Clinton ally Bill de Blasio, the man who would eventually get the Democratic nomination and win the election in a landslide. </p> <p>However, Weiner\u2019s campaign was wounded after he admitted that a self-taken picture of his penis, which appeared on the internet, was in fact his. Weiner had sent the picture to a 22-year-old woman he made contact with after leaving Congress, using the now infamous alias \u201c\u2018Carlos Danger\u201d in his interactions with her.</p> <p>In a statement at the time, Weiner said: \u201cI said that other texts and photos were likely to come out, and today they have. These things that I did were wrong and hurtful to my wife and caused us to go through challenges in our marriage that extended past my resignation from Congress.</p> <p>\u201cThis behavior is behind me. I\u2019ve apologized to Huma and am grateful that she has worked through these issues with me and for her forgiveness.\u201d</p> <p>Abedin initially spoke in defense of Weiner but the former congressman\u2019s election hopes were further tarnished after he admitted sending sexually explicit messages to several other women.

In the Oregon case, one juror said he would have had no problem convicting the defendants of trespassing but the conspiracy charge, which carries much stiffer penalties, was a stretch.</p> <p>In an age of anti-establishment anger, jurors also appear to have been swayed by the sheer confidence of the prosecuting attorneys. </p> <p>\u201cThe <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-standoff/2016/10/juror_4_prosecutors_in_oregon.html\">air of triumphalism</a> that the prosecution brought was not lost on any of us,\u201d juror four wrote to the Oregonian newspaper, \u201cnor was it warranted given their burden of proof.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Pitcavage of the Anti-Defamation League, one of America\u2019s foremost authorities on rightwing extremism, said he could only imagine that courtroom dynamics along these lines had undone what had otherwise seemed like a very strong government case. </p> <p>\u201cI was hardly alone in thinking that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mere fact that many of the standoff defendants entered into plea deals rather than go to trial suggests that they and their attorneys also felt the government had a very strong case.\u201d</p> <p>There was similar incredulity at the not guilty verdicts in Fort Smith in 1988, as analysts pondered how the government could possibly lose a case against leaders and foot soldiers of the Ku Klux Klan and Aryan Nations, among other organizations, some of whom had previously been proven to have robbed banks and armored trucks, killed people, and openly called for the violent overthrow of the government.</p> <p>On that occasion, the jury\u2019s sympathy for the defendants was clear. One female juror started up a romance with defendant David Lane, previously convicted of murdering a talk-radio host in Denver. Another female juror ended up marrying David McGuire, charged with plotting to kill an FBI agent and a federal judge.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t help that the judge dispensed with standard jury selection and hand-picked an all-white panel over the objections of the prosecution. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/28/reaction-bundy-brothers-found-not-guilty-oregon-militia-standoff-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59k5c\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2849079\"            data-video-name=\"Reaction after Bundy brothers found not guilty in Oregon militia standoff \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58133036e4b0219a00d3993b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028bundy_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028bundy.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028bundy_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/28/reaction-bundy-brothers-found-not-guilty-oregon-militia-standoff-video\">Reaction after Bundy brothers found not guilty in Oregon militia standoff</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cIf we\u2019d had good jury selection, I think we would have won the case,\u201d the FBI agent targeted for assassination, Jack Knox, said in an interview years later. \u201cThe judge \u2026 was dredging right at the bottom of the barrel.\u201d</p> <p>Another former FBI agent with extensive experience of the radical far right, Danny Coulson, did not exclude the possibility of similar sympathies being at play in the Oregon case \u2013 on the side of law enforcement as much as the jury.

  "<p>The film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/03/moonlight-review-devastating-drama-is-vital-portrait-of-black-gay-masculinity-in-america\">Moonlight</a> is extraordinary for many reasons, but to me it is most so for two. First, it considers black boys to be precious, at a time when news stories perpetually make it seem as if the United States considers them to be utterly expendable. Second, it acknowledges the effects that the stalking ghosts of premature death and incarceration have upon gay black masculinity \u2013 and it manages to do so without ever diminishing the lives full of complex humanity that black gay men still manage to have in America while navigating that reality.</p> <p>So often, gay lives in America are coded as white, and the forces that shape the lives of queer people of color \u2013 say, how immigration affects being Chicano and gay in Calfornia, or how police surveillance affects being black and gay in the New York \u2013 are ignored, as gay identity is usually swept up into whiteness. Moonlight eschews this reductivism entirely, brilliantly portraying in a lyrical story how love and connection attempt to take hold. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/03/moonlight-review-devastating-drama-is-vital-portrait-of-black-gay-masculinity-in-america\">Moonlight review \u2013 devastating drama is vital portrait of black gay masculinity in America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fact that there are about <a href=\"https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Finteractive%2F2015%2F04%2F20%2Fupshot%2Fmissing-black-men.html%3F_r%3D1\">a million and a half black men disappeared</a> from American society by early death and incarceration is not a side issue to black gay men. It\u2019s certainly no side issue to Chiron, Moonlight\u2019s hero, who successfully seeks out a father figure, Juan (Mahershala Ali), only to lose him to an early death. And yet, Moonlight also shows how creative and brilliant black humanity is at being so much more than its pain. Director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/15/why-i-love-barry-jenkins-bim-adewunmi\">Barry Jenkins </a>doesn\u2019t dwell on Juan\u2019s death as much as he does on the beauty of his embrace of Chiron in his arms in the sea, on his smile, on his joyful proclamation that you can find black people wherever you go in the world.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NJj12tJzqc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9NJj12tJzqc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Another gift Jenkins gives not just to American cinema, but to American culture, is that he depicts black boyhood as something worthy of rooting for to succeed. It is not especially difficult to make white boyhood precious. In the 2014 movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/19/boyhood-selma-american-sniper-race-part-one\">Boyhood</a>, director Richard Linklater encouraged the audience to hold as precious and unique Mason, a banal and totally average white American child who existed in an imaginary nearly all-white Texas. Mason and his friend engage in petty vandalism, and also drink and drive \u2013 and yet, Mason, \u201cno angel\u201d, was excused and held dear in a way a black child never would be. </p> <p>Lately, I have been thinking a lot about a <a href=\"http://news.yale.edu/2016/09/27/implicit-bias-may-help-explain-high-preschool-expulsion-rates-black-children\">Yale study</a> where pre-school teachers were asked to watch videos of very young children to look for signs of trouble, and eye-tracking software revealed their eyes went for the black boys first and watched them the most. And why wouldn\u2019t they? As consumers of non-fiction media in America, we are always being told that black boys are suspicious and that violence against them is justifiable. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/15/its-impossible-to-be-vulnerable-how-moonlight-reflects-being-a-black-gay-man-in-the-us\">\u2018It\u2019s impossible to be vulnerable\u2019: how Moonlight reflects being a black gay man in the US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The same week Moonlight opened, a sign commemorating <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/22/us/mississippi-emmett-till-sign-bullets/\">Emmett Till, murdered for whistling at a white woman,</a> was riddled with bullet holes \u2013 a 14-year-old still considered suspect, six decades after being lynched. But white boys, like Boyhood\u2019s Mason, are considered innocent by default. As we saw the same actor, Ellar Coltraine, grow up on film over 12 years, we were encouraged to see him as the future of America, worth protecting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a45822785bda0210278c8c0aa7224587ab528242\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a45822785bda0210278c8c0aa7224587ab528242/0_0_3072_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jharrel Jerome as Kevin and Ashton Sanders as Chiron in Moonlight\u2019s second act.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jharrel Jerome as Kevin and Ashton Sanders as Chiron in Moonlight\u2019s second act.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Bornfriend/film company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Moonlight, we also see a boy, Chiron, turn into a young man over many years, though we only see him at three stages, each time played by a different actor. Jenkins and the actor who plays \u201cLittle\u201d Chiron, Alex R Hibbert, are extraordinarily effective at melting your heart. We root for Little Chiron and his watchful eyes, whether he is avoiding bullies or tepidly checking out his friends as they compare penises. When he poured boiling water into the tub, my heart was in my throat that he could be hurt.</p> <p>But what is more extraordinary, perhaps, is that Jenkins continues to retain our sympathies as Chiron develops into a less passive and more complex person </p> <p>The breadth of Moonlight\u2019s ambitions, and the deft way it deals with complexity is captured at the end of its second chapter, when something happens that chilled me both times I\u2019ve seen it. Chiron (now portrayed by Ashton Sanders) approaches Terrel, a bully who had ordered Chiron\u2019s friend Kevin to beat Chiron up, and smashes a chair over his head. The scene is stunning, not just as a surprise act of revenge from a character whom the audience has experienced as sensitive and sweet, but of how visually reminiscent it is of something that happened in real life. In 2015, a black man named <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://mic.com/articles/147556/what-bayna-el-amin-s-assault-case-says-about-racism-in-the-lgbtq-community#.gRCkNzilQ\">Bayna El-Amin </a>smashed a chair over a white gay couple in a BBQ restaurant in New York\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood.</p> <p>When a video of the attack went viral without context, it led to calls for an investigation into whether the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://joemygod.blogspot.com/2015/06/report-accused-fugitive-in-chelsea.html\">\u201cthug\u201d</a> El-Amin had committed a hate crime against the white gay men. But the story was more complex. El-Amin identified as queer in some way, and claimed that the act was in retribution for a fight started by the white gay men he hit with the chair.</p> <p>Gay advocacy groups were interested in the case when it could have been about two white gay men hit by a straight black man, but lost interest when it turned out to be about a black queer man hitting back against white gay men who had started a fight. In different ways, the fictive, slight Chiron and the real life, brawny El-Amin show that it is possible to be black, gay and able to exact revenge against the person who is causing you pain by hitting them with a chair. These narratives muddle a clean victim-perpetrator narrative, do not go well for anyone involved, and are so human.</p> <p>The person I saw Moonlight with (another queer person of color) cheered aloud when Chiron hit Kevin, then sighed when the police showed up, because he knew Chiron\u2019s decision to defend himself was going to cost him dearly. (It also cost El-Amin, who was sentenced to <a href=\"http://www.advocate.com/crime/2016/9/15/nine-year-sentence-man-convicted-chair-attack-nyc-restaurant\">nine years</a>.) By the end of the scene, we don\u2019t know for how long Chiron is going away for. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ac7729663077f00fc54124c3a9497a6bbbc0d93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ac7729663077f00fc54124c3a9497a6bbbc0d93/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heart-melting: Alex Hibbert as little Chirone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heart-melting: Alex Hibbert as little Chiron.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Bornfriend, courtesy of A24</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Moonlight\u2019s third and final chapter, we do know that Chiron has gone away for some time (during which he meets someone who has now put him out on the block to sell drugs); that his friend Kevin was also incarcerated; that his father figure has died prematurely, and that his mother, Paula (Naomie Harris) lives under some kind of supervised control in a rehab center. When Chiron reconnects with Kevin, he is still on parole, and the experiences of confinement have heavily affected everyone \u2013 especially Paula, who is so broken by it she chooses to stay in the rehab center when she could leave because she can\u2019t survive outside.</p> <p>Even in the film\u2019s uplifting moments, it is depressing that everyone in Chiron\u2019s life is either dead or living under some form of state surveillance. Jenkins deals with this deftly, without being heavy-handed or dismissive, and makes the characters no less worthy of our support.</p> <p>The first time I saw Moonlight, I was worried that it could create a dangerous takeaway message: that if black gay men want to lead full lives, they should try to escape from the violence of other black men and into the arms of whiteness. A reading of the film to that point could be saying that Chiron\u2019s precious boyhood could not be trusted to other black boys and men and might better be nurtured elsewhere. </p> <p>As the 1989 film <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/pov/tonguesuntied/\">Tongues Untied</a> \u2013 still so relevant today \u2013 points out, it is common for black gay men to internalize a fear of one another and to buy into a push that we ought to flee into the arms of a white gay man. Like worshipping a Brad Pitt-like portrait of Jesus Christ in church, it is easy for black gay men to internalize society\u2019s pressure to idealize white men and believe that salvation can be had by being closer to whiteness. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64a659145a70e5a7df73b5b480ca26f03db5b585\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64a659145a70e5a7df73b5b480ca26f03db5b585/0_0_5640_3760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Hibbert and Mahershala Ali as Juan: a model of gay acceptance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Hibbert and Mahershala Ali as Juan: a model of gay acceptance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Bornfriend, courtesy of A24</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the shootings of mostly Latino queer people at the Pulse nightclub, I have consciously been trying to spend time in queer communities of color, meeting likeminded folks who also desire queerness in skin that looks like theirs. But even among us, it has been sad to learn how often black gay men tell me that out in the world, those like them won\u2019t give them the acknowledging head nod on the street. Brothers have also shared their sadness that they think black gay men won\u2019t date them because they\u2019re waiting for a white boyfriend. So the first time I saw Moonlight, I worried the bullying Chiron received could fit into a flight towards white narrative.</p> <p>But on a second viewing, my fears were allayed for three main reasons. First and most obviously, Chiron doesn\u2019t flee into the arms of a white man, but to his friend Kevin. (Significantly though, like Juan\u2019s partner Teresa, played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/janelle-monae\">Janelle Mon\u00e1e</a>, Kevin is also light-skinned, teasingly calls Chiron \u201cblack\u201d and only acted under the orders of the dark-skinned Terrel.) Second, Juan, Chiron\u2019s father figure in the first chapter, lovingly deflects any sense of shame little Chiron could feel when he asks what a \u201cfaggot\u201d is and whether he is one. Juan embodies some of the hardest masculinity in the film and is also a model of gay acceptance, slaying the canard that black people are more homophobic than white people.</p> <p>Finally, Moonlight is an all-black world, devoid of respectability politics. While it tells the story of ambiguous sexuality, it does so with unambiguous blackness and without shame. When stories eschew the white gaze and exist entirely inside of blackness, the protagonists and antagonists are all black. When Marvel\u2019s Luke Cage faces oppression from other black opponents and not from white people, this is not a denial of white supremacy. Similarly, seeing black kids beat each other up in Moonlight is not a call to abandon black masculinity as insufficient to cope with black homosexuality, but to wrestle with the reality of black gay men in its totality.</p>",
