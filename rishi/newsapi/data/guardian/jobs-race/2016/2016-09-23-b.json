We are evolving our game and the task is to match New Zealand, who are setting the standards. It means improving our home record from the 70% record in the last three years. The Principality Stadium is an inspiration to opponents and I want it to inspire our players more.\u201d</p> <p>Howley would be released by Wales if the Lions wanted him to be attack coach next year, as he was in 2009 and 2013. \u201cI am not thinking about that,\u201d he said. \u201cTeam Wales comes first and my task is ensuring that we reach another level in November and beyond.\u201d</p>",

Philip Berg, a former Pennsylvania official who supported Clinton, filed a lawsuit in 2008 over Obama\u2019s birth certificate; the suit was<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/01/29/supreme-court-ousts-attorney-who-sued-to-oust-obama/\"> thrown out because it was groundless</a>.

The Blaze\u2019s up-and-coming TV pundit opened with the view that Beyonc\u00e9 was pushing the notion that \u201cblack lives matter more\u201d.

Just this month, she proved again that her formula works. Her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq0_nyWVXCI \">takedown</a> of NFL star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/12/colin-kaepernick-anthem-protest-monday-night-football\">Colin Kaepernick\u2019s national anthem protest</a> was posted on Facebook on 31 August. At the time of writing, after just three weeks, it had garnered nearly 65m views on that platform alone.</p> <p>Political scientist Dan Cassino, author of a new book on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fox-News-American-Politics-Psychology/dp/1138900125\">Fox News</a>, says this willingness to make \u201ca rightwing criticism of pop culture\u201d is one of the things that has so quickly developed Lahren\u2019s profile: \u201cIt is a surefire way to inject yourself into the soft news cycle. That\u2019s a niche that other people haven\u2019t moved into, and she\u2019s done a very good job of that.\u201d</p> <p>Her success is especially striking given that barely two years ago, the only videos she was appearing in were YouTube posts from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPU7k4jQUPE\">The Scramble</a>, the student newscast she hosted at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.</p> <p>Mark Ciavolo was UNLV student body president at the time Lahren hosted the show, and was a regular guest. He\u2019s also a conservative, and counts Lahren as a friend. \u201cShe\u2019s been a consistent conservative voice as long as I\u2019ve known her.\u201d He says her role on The Scramble was more the even-handed host, but her views haven\u2019t changed, even though \u201cthe delivery might vary\u201d. He\u2019s not surprised by her steep, post-collegiate trajectory. \u201cTomi is a very determined, strong woman.\u201d</p> <p>Lahren says her UNLV experience proves that she can do journalism, but that\u2019s not what she\u2019s doing now. \u201cI fully acknowledge that I am not a journalist. I clearly have a point of view, I am very passionate about my point of view. I am a commentator.\u201d </p> <p>Near the end of her degree, in April 2014, she went looking for a journalism internship. The Blaze rejected her application with a form letter. She reached out to the fledgling One America News Network. CEO Robert Herring replied directly, saying they didn\u2019t offer internships but she should come in and \u201cwe\u2019ll see if there\u2019s a job for you\u201d.</p> <p>The audition was successful, and at just 21, she was thrown in at the deep end, running her own show, On Point on OANN, which began in August 2014. <br>\u201cI built it from the ground up, and I learned a lot because I didn\u2019t have a lot of help.\u201d</p> <p>She developed the Final Thoughts segment, and began to think about how it could garner attention beyond the ranks of the channel\u2019s small audience. </p> <p>\u201cI noticed early on that people liked my Final Thoughts, so that\u2019s when we started pulling them and putting them on YouTube.\u201d<br></p> <p>Their quick cuts, discontinuous camera movements, and compression were perfectly pitched to the short attention spans of the social media era. So is Lahren\u2019s forthright outrage. Lahren calls them \u201cdirect, succinct, easy to understand and easy to follow\u201d.</p> <p>In July 2015 she got her first brush with national notoriety, when she criticised Barack Obama\u2019s reluctance to blame Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez\u2019s shootings on a military recruiting centre and navy reserve base in Chattanooga on \u201cradical Islam\u201d. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABrauM7yvco\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ABrauM7yvco?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Lahren\u2019s boyfriend at the time was deployed overseas with the US military, so \u201cit was something that really resonated with me, and I was very angry at the way the media was covering it.\u201d With American flags streaming on a monitor behind her, Lahren said, among other things: \u201cRadical Islam is becoming the rule, not the exception. Yesterday\u2019s moderate is today\u2019s terrorist.\u201d She also called for a redoubled assault on Isis.<br></p> <p>The next morning, her phone blew up.</p> <p>\u201cPeople from high school were texting me and saying \u2018You\u2019re going viral.\u2019 I was the girl who eviscerated Obama.\u201d</p> <p>The video not only demonstrated that Final Thoughts was a winning formula: it brought her to the attention of honchos at The Blaze, Glenn Beck\u2019s post-Fox News conservative media company. Having rejected her as an intern, they recruited her as a rising star.</p> <p>In her new primetime slot, she is still intimately involved with the day-to-day production of the show, and she is dedicated to it. \u201cI don\u2019t have a family, I don\u2019t have a boyfriend. I am in Dallas for one reason only, and that is to do this show.\u201d She makes it back to her home town of Rapid City, South Dakota, only on the biggest holidays. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m very controversial, and I don\u2019t back down from being controversial</p> <footer> <cite>Tomi Lahren</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her senior producer, Jessica Grose, works closely with Lahren. She came to The Blaze from long stints in daytime television, from TMZ to Oprah. She says they\u2019re not just colleagues but close friends. Grose\u2019s political views are less fixed, but she says that when she met her, \u201cI knew that there was something insanely special about her.\u201d Grose\u2019s pop culture chops feed into Lahren\u2019s issue and story selection. </p> <p>Lahren, Grose, and the rest of their small production team are all young women \u2013 unusual in any media company, and a surprise in a conservative outfit. That doesn\u2019t make her a feminist, though. In her view, that movement has been \u201chijacked\u201d, and has become \u201cpassively aggressively anti-men\u201d.</p> <p>This view might seem to contradict her independence and intense ambition. But historically, according to Professor Ronnee Schreiber at UC San Diego, conservative women have often been prominent in holding anti-feminist positions, not only as a movement strategy, but because \u201cit\u2019s a media story, and it helps conservative women get media attention\u201d.</p> <p>When asked to nominate a single quality that explains the speed with which she has become successful, Lahren quickly replies: \u201cFearlessness. I am fearless.\u201d Others who share her conservative views use the same adjective. Ciavolo, her college friend, says Lahren \u201chas been fearless in the way she\u2019s presented her message\u201d.</p> <p>Glenn Beck, her boss for just over a year, says via email: \u201cTomi speaks her mind and is fearless. At this point in history people are looking for people that say what they believe, regardless of the consequences.\u201d</p> <p>Lahren agrees with his analysis: \u201cThere are too many conservatives who are terrified of being labelled. They\u2019re afraid of being labelled and they\u2019re afraid of being not liked. I do not bullshit, I am genuine and authentic. I don\u2019t say these things to go viral or to be controversial, but I say things that a lot of people wish they could say but are fearful of saying.\u201d One of the labels some conservatives shrink from \u2013 and it is one that critics have freely applied to Lahren \u2013 is racist. She says commenters have repeatedly lampooned her as \u201cwhite power Barbie\u201d.</p> <p> It\u2019s undeniable that her notoriety has come from incidents where she has taken on topics related to immigration (she describes herself as a \u201chardliner\u201d on the topic) and anything associated with or inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, which in one segment she compared to the Ku Klux Klan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"baa42aa07bd95a531bd9328442f95481e77ad5a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/baa42aa07bd95a531bd9328442f95481e77ad5a4/5_0_545_551/495.png\" alt=\"Tomi Lahren: \u2018I clearly have a point of view\u2019.\" width=\"495\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tomi Lahren: \u2018I clearly have a point of view.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tomi Lahren</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cassino, the political scientist, thinks that like Donald Trump, Lahren may be both an example and beneficiary of a sea change in the way conservatives talk about race. \u201cThere was an unspoken rule in the conservative movement for a long time, which they learned from Richard Nixon: you do not talk openly about race. It was seen as toxic to talk about it in anything but dog whistles.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty years ago, conservative commentators would talk in code about it, in terms of \u201cwelfare\u201d, \u201cinner city crime\u201d, or \u201cfamily breakdown\u201d. But in the last five to 10 years, Cassino says, \u201cit has become acceptable for conservatives to talk about race in concrete terms\u201d.</p> <p>The election of Obama, for example, led to arguments that talk of racial inequality was overblown, and eventually to criticisms of the president in terms of his racial identity. All of this precisely coincides with Lahren\u2019s formative political years.</p> <p>Like Trump and many other conservatives, Lahren puts this change down to a weariness with political correctness. \u201cFor too long, white people have been told that they can\u2019t talk about race, and that only some people of colour can talk about race. I don\u2019t buy that.\u201d<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t say things to go viral, I say things that a lot of people wish they could say but are fearful of saying</p> <footer> <cite>Tomi Lahren</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She insists that she is not racist, but also that \u201cthere can\u2019t be a group of people in this country who are blamed for the ills of minority communities and then not allowed to speak or defend themselves.\u201d</p> <p>This appeal to white grievances is similar to the one made by the Trump campaign. Even if more conservatives are more willing to talk bluntly about their own racial views, there is still, for their audiences, a frisson in this that gets attention.</p> <p>Lahren has lately become a more enthusiastic supporter of the Republican nominee after her first choice, Marco Rubio, lost. A big motivation is her dislike of his opponent. \u201cI am #NeverHillary all the way down,\u201d she says. \u201cYou may not like what Donald Trump says, but I don\u2019t like what Hillary Clinton does.\u201d Trump\u2019s excesses, she says, are forgivable as the flourishes of a performer. \u201cI\u2019m a performer, too,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Part of that performance is self-presentation, and her appearance is something that has attracted the ire of critics, including, she says, feminists. Certainly, it\u2019s been suggested that she is where she is because of her looks. \u201cI take care of myself,\u201d she says. \u201cDo some people watch me because they think I\u2019m pretty? Maybe, sure. But more are watching because they appreciate what I am saying.\u201d </p> <p>Her gender and age, however, do differentiate her from a sea of middle-aged, male conservative pundits \u2013 the kind of guys Cassino says are a dime a dozen. Just as important are her broadcasting talent and her ability to \u201cseize this political moment\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq0_nyWVXCI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qq0_nyWVXCI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>As to whether Lahren\u2019s moment will last beyond our current political season, one consideration is that The Blaze, her employer, has had well-reported financial difficulties. The subscriber base is small, but it is also suffering from the same problem that led to the departure of Glenn Beck\u2019s still-popular show from Fox News. That is, an inability to attract big advertisers to support programming which is perceived as extreme.</p> <p>Lahren says she is committed to The Blaze, and is full of praise for Beck, but at some point she may be forced to find a new perch. According to Cassino, this may not be easy. \u201cThe messaging she\u2019s doing is going to make it very difficult for her to get mainstream advertisers. Like it or not, what you say on television is dictated by the likes of Procter &amp; Gamble and Chevy,\u201d Cassino says.</p> <p>Especially on issues of race, Lahren is speaking in terms corporate clients might find difficult to associate themselves with. And if she changes her messaging, what happens to her \u201cfearless\u201d and \u201cauthentic\u201d conservative brand? This is not something Beck is worried about. In his email, he added: \u201cAs long as she continues to be authentic, continues to seek knowledge, and is true to herself \u2013 even when she feels compelled to go against the grain, and her audience \u2013 she will be a force to be reckoned with for years to come.\u201d</p> <p>Lahren clearly understands why and how her Final Thoughts videos work. \u201cI\u2019m very controversial, and I don\u2019t back down from being controversial,\u201d she says. She is able to articulate 2016\u2019s conservative anger, and target its sources, in a way that seems fresh. </p> <p>It\u2019s hard to see that anger dissipating, whatever the result of the election, but even if it does, Lahren may be around for a long time. Like American conservatism itself, she is supremely resourceful and adaptable. </p>",
  "<p><strong>What is it? </strong>A 40-minute glimpse into a dark world, lit up by the tireless efforts of an incredible group.</p> <p><strong>Why you\u2019ll love it:</strong> Love is not the word. This is a film you need to see to begin to understand day-to-day life in war-torn Syria. A documentary crew follows the White Helmets, a group of volunteer rescue workers with branches all over the country, who risk their own safety to pull fellow citizens from bomb wreckage.</p> <p>Hands reach through smoke to grab scared children from rubble in the half-light. It is relentless and also an incredible editing job as the narration-free footage gives a visceral sense of the widespread trauma. You follow the rescuers with no need to ask questions. You can see the necessity of what they are doing and the dreadful circumstances under which they\u2019re doing it.</p> <p>The White Helmets hurtle around the streets, pointing their van towards every new mushroom cloud on the horizon, dedicated to pulling their stricken brothers and sisters from the remains of hospitals and markets and cafes. The attacks are daily and target civilian life at its most mundane: shoppers shopping, workers working.</p> <p>You see hints of the men\u2019s own families, toddlers left at home not knowing if their fathers will come back, brothers killed in attacks even while their sibling is hurtling towards another explosion across town. Crackly mobile phone conversations, a lifeline or not, depending on the news at the other end of them.</p> <p>In a moment of quiet, the men sit on the floor sharing a meal, food halfway to their mouths when they hear the roar of military aircraft overhead and dash for the door. They rush towards the scene of a barrel bomb attack, black smoke rising into the sky. These are usually rusty barrels, filled with explosives and anything from nails to chlorine, pushed out of the back of government helicopters.</p> <p>Crying kids stumble out into the street and babies with bleeding heads are carefully handed from one man to another. They won\u2019t leave a bombsite until they have accounted for everyone. The determination is total.</p> <p>The pace of the footage is dizzying, the action chaotic and yet the message clear. To tell a story in these circumstances is not only impressive but important. Everyone here is risking their lives to pass it on.</p> <p>A tiny baby, only a week old, is born a second time; still alive after 16 hours under rubble, the child is dragged through a narrow passage made in the dust by a frantic volunteer. The \u201cmiracle baby\u201d becomes a talisman of hope, another reason for them all to keep going despite the nature of their task; like a child patiently standing up dominoes while a bully follows behind, knocking them over.</p> <p>Their belief in better times is genuine, but where does the hope come from? In a once-colourful city bleached grey by dust, they live on the rush of another life saved.</p> <p>A little boy they had previously rescued visits their training camp with his thankful mother, and one of the men places the distinctive white helmet on the kid\u2019s head. The boy looks up, delighted. This is their hope.</p> <p><strong>Where</strong> Netflix.</p> <p><strong>Length</strong> 40 minutes.</p> <p><strong>Stand-out episode</strong> It\u2019s a one-off.</p> <p><strong>Also watch</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUjHb4C7b94\">The Islamic State (Vice on YouTube)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/video/2365297690/\">Rise of the Islamic State: Losing Iraq</a> (PBS.org).</p>",
  "<p>Bureaucracy. It\u2019s a word laden with dark memories. We\u2019ve all been caught up in it.

This is where, until this week, Gregg and Kathryn Brain, found themselves. Having moved to Scotland in 2011 on Kathryn Brain\u2019s student visa, the family had hoped to remain in the country by moving on to a post-study visa, but the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/12/scotland-visa-betrayal-trust-australian-deportation-couple-gregg-kathryn-brain\" title=\"\">scrapped this scheme</a> in 2012, potentially affecting <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/8185579/Foreign-students-forced-to-go-home-after-studies-under-tough-new-immigration-rules.html\" title=\"\">tens of thousands</a>.

And yet it\u2019s hard not to look at this smiling family, relieved at what has been salvaged by the goodwill of others, and think of those we seem unwilling to welcome. No one wishes misfortune on any family. In fact, I\u2019d like to think I share in this family\u2019s happiness. They have overcome a system that otherwise would have treated them as merely numbers. Their story has moved a community to action. It\u2019s been accepted that these are people with much to offer. In short, they have been acknowledged as deserving and thus belonging. Does the fact that they are white and from Australia have anything to do with it? Yes, they hail from the other side of the planet but really, they might as well, pardon the pun, be neighbours.</p> <p>If this post-Brexit referendum story tells us anything, it is that there is room for foreigners in this country, but only if they are people like \u201cus\u201d. Debates about being \u201cswamped\u201d by immigrants never, funnily, seem to centre on antipodeans with Anglo-Saxon origins. In notes for how to be a good immigrant we might as well write: be a) white; and b) from a rich country of origin.</p> <p>We should view the story as instructive because, here, people have clearly seen how traumatic a return to a \u201chome\u201d country, embarked upon under duress, might be for the Brains. But we can be in no way confused; Australia hasn\u2019t remained a penal outpost. A return there is perhaps stressful and inconvenient but it is not the end of the world. It is another matter, however, if you are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/22/eritrea-migrants-child-soldier-fled-what-is-going\" title=\"\">Eritrean</a>.
