  "<p></p> <p>Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) workers are a third more likely than white workers to be underemployed with fewer hours of employment than they would like, according to the Trades Union Congress.</p> <p>The TUC warns in a report today that the higher underemployment rate for BAME workers is a waste of talent and is calling on employers and ministers to tackle discrimination in the workplace.</p> <p>The report follows a review by the government\u2019s human rights watchdog last week that concluded that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/human-rights-watchdog-urgent-action-deep-rooted-inequality\">life chances for young minority ethnic people had got worse over the past five years</a> and were \u201cthe most challenging for generations\u201d. The <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en\">Equality and Human Rights Commission</a> (EHRC) said BAME workers faced higher unemployment rates, lower pay and were underrepresented in senior roles.</p> <p>The TUC used official figures to analyse how BAME workers were being affected by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/29/millions-of-uk-workers-stuck-in-wrong-job-analysis-shows\">underemployment</a>, a measure of those in employment who work shorter hours than they would like. It highlights that in the first quarter of 2016, BAME workers had an underemployment rate of 15.3%, compared with 11.5% for white workers. The research shows that if BAME workers had the same rate as white workers, more than 110,000 would be lifted out of underemployment. </p> <p>\u201cUnderemployment is a major problem in the UK, and it only gets worse if you\u2019re black, Asian, or part of any ethnic minority. This is not only wrong, but a massive waste of talent too,\u201d said the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/jun/27/how-you-can-tackle-discrimination-at-work\">How you can tackle discrimination at work</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe know this is part of a much bigger story. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/15/bame-graduates-25-times-more-likely-to-be-jobless-than-white-peers\">BAME workers are more likely to be unemployed</a>, paid less, and aren\u2019t getting enough of the top jobs. Employers and the government cannot afford to ignore these problems. They must now take real action to tackle underemployment and pay discrimination.\u201d </p> <p>The former business secretary Sajid Javid had called on businesses to do more to support the careers of black and minority ethnic (BME) workers and commissioned Ruby McGregor-Smith, the chief executive of the facilities management company Mitie, to undertake an independent review of BAME progression at work. The review is due to report by the end of this year.</p> <p>The TUC report forms part of its submission to the McGregor-Smith review.</p> <p>Responding to the TUC\u2019s findings, a government spokesman said: \u201cOnce in the labour market many ethnic minorities still face unfair obstacles that prevent them from fulfilling their potential. </p> <p>\u201cThat is why we asked Baroness McGregor-Smith to undertake a review looking at the barriers faced by employees and business in developing ethnic minority talent.

  "<p>New mothers are facing increasing discrimination when they take maternity leave including being made redundant and switched to zero-hours contracts.</p> <p>Citizens Advice has recorded a nearly 60% rise in the number of women seeking advice about maternity leave issues this year. Just over 3,300 came to the charity with such issues in the year to June compared to 2,099 last year.</p> <p>The surge in reported problems has emerged after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/12/sports-direct-staff-who-took-maternity-leave-put-on-zero-hours-contracts\">the Guardian revealed that Sports Direct workers returning from maternity leave are claiming they were moved on to zero-hours contracts</a>. The claims were made in court documents relating to a breach-of-contract case in which workers say they were excluded from the retailer\u2019s generous bonus scheme.</p> <p>Citizens Advice says the introduction of fees for employment tribunals, through which workers can challenge poor treatment, has combined with the rise of zero-hours contracts, agency work and multiple part-time jobs to make employees more vulnerable to sharp practice on maternity rights.</p> <p>Legally, women are protected from losing their job, having their hours changed or their responsibility reduced as a result of pregnancy. While employment and sex discrimination legislation offers protection, responsibility for enforcing such employment rights is spread across a wide range of agencies, from HMRC to the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice.</p> <p>\u201cThis confusing landscape means some bad bosses are getting away with treating their employees unfairly,\u201d Guy said. \u201cThere is an opportunity for the government to consider bringing together the expertise of all current labour market enforcement functions into one well-resourced, effective body to investigate bad practice.\u201d</p> <p>Citizens Advice said the most common issue it dealt with in relation to maternity leave was being made redundant followed by a reduction in hours, including being moved to a zero-hours contract and having a role changed upon return to work.</p> <p>A report into the issue, released by Citizens Advice this week, highlights the case of Nadia, who worked as a head chef in a local pub on a permanent contract. When she had difficulties during her pregnancy that meant she could no longer work in the kitchen she was offered work as a waitress on a zero-hours contract.</p> <p>Another woman, who works for a national retail chain, told the Guardian she had her hours cut from about 34 a week to 26 during her pregnancy after she arrived late for work on one occasion. </p> <p>\u201cThey said it was for my safety but that didn\u2019t make sense. I was fine,\u201d she said.

One, Joe McHugh, created a Jefferson Airplane-inspired poster called <a href=\"https://uk.pinterest.com/pin/538883911641195435/\">White Rabbit</a>, which depicted a rabbit standing on a chessboard, the words \u201ckeep your head\u201d dematerialising in the background. The other, Stanley Miller, known as Mouse, made the <a href=\"http://www.rrauction.com/Stanley-Mouse-Grateful-Dead-Painting.html\">skull and roses artwork for the Grateful Dead</a>, although he much preferred hanging out with Janis Joplin. \u201cShe was wild,\u201d he remembers, with a glint in his eye. \u201cThe first time she came to my studio she chased me around \u2013 I was kind of scared of her.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People drew pictures of the psych experience with lot of colours and mandalas, but to me, on acid everything got clear</p> <footer> <cite>Stanley 'Mouse' Miller</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Music had drawn him from Detroit to California: \u201cIt was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/16/how-we-made-eight-miles-high-the-byrds\">the Byrds</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mamas_%26_the_Papas\">the Mama and the Papas</a> \u2013 that ringing sound, like a siren calling me,\u201d he says, still dreamy at the memory. Like most of the cultural productions of the time, his posters were drug-induced, but he never employed the bulbous lettering and eye-searing hues popular at the time. \u201cA lot of people, how they drew pictures of the psych experience was a lot of colours and mandalas, but to me, [on acid] everything got super-clear.\u201d</p> <p>Miller later moved to London, where he spent a year working for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_(UK_magazine)\">Nova magazine</a> and hanging out at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Corps\">Beatles\u2019 Apple headquarters</a> on Savile Row (now a branch of Abercrombie and Fitch). He saw their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles%27_rooftop_concert\">final concert take place on the building\u2019s roof</a>, without realising that he was witnessing history. He also stopped taking acid that year. \u201cIt fell out of fashion. It was replaced in the 70s by a lot of cocaine and I didn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2a27205ac934e9e372d8438e64703efed2db3957\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a27205ac934e9e372d8438e64703efed2db3957/210_0_2120_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dylan by Milton Glaser, 1967; a concert poster for the Avalon Ballroom, designed by Stanley \u2018Mouse\u2019 Miller and Alton Kelley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"725\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dylan by Milton Glaser, 1967; a concert poster for the Avalon Ballroom, designed by Stanley \u2018Mouse\u2019 Miller and Alton Kelley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Milton Glaser/DACS /Victoria and Albert Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The following day, we meet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/stewart-brand\">Stewart Brand</a> with his friend and collaborator <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Kahn\">Lloyd Kahn</a> at his <a href=\"http://theinterval.org/\">cafe and library within the Long Now Foundation</a>, which is dedicated to his dream of building a clock that will run for 10,000 years. With the aid of some genetic engineers, Brand is also trying to bring back 12 extinct species, and says that he is making real progress on the woolly mammoth: \u201cWe use the Asian elephant as a scaffold to assemble the geonome.\u201d</p> <p>Brand had an intense but limited period of drug experimentation; at 80, Kahn still uses marijuana, although he vapes rather than smokes it. The first time Kahn took acid, he says, \u201cI saw a flower breathing and it wasn\u2019t a hallucination. Flowers do breathe, but you don\u2019t really see it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The show delineates how the world transformed in those seismic years of the 1960s</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a biology student at Stanford, Brand first took mescaline when in the army, then became a participant in one of the famous government-sponsored scientific studies of the effects of LSD at Menlo Park, which helped to ignite the 60s drug culture. \u201cThe hippie phenomenon was to go and discover how the world works, so all the kids went out with backpacks doing the same thing. And we learned a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Soon he was travelling to Native American reservations where he engaged in all-night <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyote\">peyote</a> rituals, joining <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/aug/06/lsd-ken-kesey-pranksters-film\">author Ken Kesey</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merry_Pranksters\">the Merry Pranksters</a> to stage the acid tests \u2013 parties fuelled by LSD that featured light shows, film projections and bands such as <a href=\"http://ultimateclassicrock.com/warlocks-grateful-dead/\">the Warlocks (who would later rename themselves the Grateful Dead</a>). \u201cWeird shit would be tried,\u201d notes Brand. The slogan was: \u201cCan you pass the acid test?\u201d \u2013 meaning, he says, \u201cCan you make it through the night without being killed or killing anybody?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d5806a58d3e9f41efae004cb15bd0bfddf165692\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5806a58d3e9f41efae004cb15bd0bfddf165692/378_505_3197_4579/698.jpg\" alt=\"Skulls and Roses poster by Stanley \u2018Mouse\u2019 Miller and Alton Kelley.\" width=\"698\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Skulls and Roses poster by Stanley \u2018Mouse\u2019 Miller and Alton Kelley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alton Kelly; Stanley Mouse/Victoria and Albert Museum, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now 77, Brand sees the inquiring and hedonistic spirit of those parties continue at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/burning-man-festival\">Nevada festival Burning Man</a>, now heavily populated by Silicon Valley workers, \u201cwith the enormous difference that we had no money and these guys have money galore. They\u2019ll spend all year building an art car that will stop your heart, just to see it chugging along. Then that feeds back into an anything-goes creativity within the tech companies.\u201d</p> <p>Brand exemplifies the intersection of the hippie movement and the technological experimentation that built Silicon Valley \u2013 the subject of the final room in the V&amp;A\u2019s exhibition. While \u201cfull of acid\u201d in 1966, the lifelong conservationist (hence the mammoths) pondered how to get more people caring about the Earth. The architect <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller\">Buckminster Fuller</a> \u2013 whose <a href=\"https://bfi.org/about-fuller/big-ideas/geodesic-domes\">geodesic dome</a> was displayed in the USA pavilion at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Biosph%C3%A8re\">1967 World Expo in Montreal</a> \u2013 had made the point \u201cthat people think it\u2019s a flat Earth, which makes them think its resources are infinite, and if they just understood it is a sphere, and therefore finite, they would treat everything differently.\u201d</p> <p>Brand got badges printed that asked: \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we seen a photograph of the whole Earth yet?\u201d and the following year an image taken by satellite was released by Nasa. It gave the cover image and title to Brand\u2019s next project, the Whole Earth Catalog, published in the autumn of 1968, biannually until 1972, then sporadically afterwards.</p> <p>Like many of the originators of San Francisco\u2019s counterculture, Brand had become fed up with the enormous influx of rubberneckers into Haight-Ashbury and, in 1968, headed out to New Mexico and Colorado to participate in the movement to live on communes in America\u2019s vast countryside. Before long, he realised that the communards would need tools, books and ideas, which he decided to collate into a mail-order catalogue. \u201cWhim is the best source,\u201d he says. \u201cThe catalogue enables the ability to have a whim and then act upon it, and that\u2019s pretty much my life.\u201d</p> <p>Brand hands me his copy of the first Whole Earth Catalog, dog-eared and with the dimensions of an oversized magazine (a copy will be in the show).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b41f1bf8e5198d3876ca59d66beda9fe50479eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b41f1bf8e5198d3876ca59d66beda9fe50479eb/0_234_3710_2226/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Psychedelic rock concert at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, 1967.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Psychedelic rock concert at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, 1967.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Michael Ochs Archives</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Purely on a media level, the Whole Earth Catalog has been hugely influential; when <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/magazine/behind-the-relaunch-of-the-new-york-times-magazine-by-jake-silverstein.html?_r=0\">the New York Times relaunched its Sunday magazine</a> in February last year, it also had a globe on the cover. The pages inside the catalogue are wonderfully designed, stuffed with information, but never messy or confusing. It wasn\u2019t this, however, that made the catalogue truly groundbreaking. First of all, it was crowdsourced \u2013 40 years before the term became commonplace. Brand appealed for readers to send in suggestions for items that those in communes would find useful (\u201cthe customers know best,\u201d he said), paid $10 per item used, and printed the most helpful, making up about a quarter of the overall content. This underlined the fact that the catalogue wasn\u2019t a book so much as a network, where likeminded people could find and share the information they needed to enter and improve alternative worlds. Symbolising this \u2013 alongside boots and teepees \u2013 the first issue featured Hewlett-Packard\u2019s desktop computer, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard_9100A\">9100A Calculator</a>, then retailing at $4,900.</p> <p>Brand straddled the worlds of the communes and computers, having become interested in the latter while studying at Stanford, where he filmed the first public demonstration of a computer mouse in 1968. \u201cI was just endlessly impatient for all these things to come into the world, because I\u2019d already seen it \u2013 the mouse and online typing, being able to mutually massage something on screen with another person, which even now is kind of difficult \u2026 [it was] apparatus to augment the human intellect.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c3d88c11a01e7a4e988b8e9f79d97a292a262528\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3d88c11a01e7a4e988b8e9f79d97a292a262528/0_0_3937_3087/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swingeing London 67 (a) 1968 69, Richard Hamilton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"784\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swingeing London 67 (a) 1968 69, Richard Hamilton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Hamilton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This reconceptualising of the world as an information network made the catalogue hugely inspiring to a significant handful of local computer scientists. To the most forward-thinking and idealistic, the possibilities of technology hinted at a new world in which information could be shared among likeminded people, leaping over barriers of geography, race or class.</p> <p>One of them was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/stevejobs\">Steve Jobs</a>, who was brought up in Palo Alto and who, in 2005, told a group of graduating students at Stanford <a href=\"http://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/14/jobs-061505/\">in a famous speech</a>: \u201cThe Whole Earth Catalog \u2026 was one of the bibles of my generation \u2026 it was a sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along. It was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.\u201d</p> <p>Jobs concluded his address with: \u201cStay hungry, stay foolish\u201d \u2013 Brand\u2019s motto from a mid-70s issue, intended as the final one, which Jobs claimed as his ethos and which has now become ubiquitous as a <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Stay+hungry,+stay+foolish+t+shirt&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjutJD1rs3OAhWBWxoKHRiSAeEQ_AUICSgC&amp;biw=2222&amp;bih=1170\">T-shirt slogan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?safe=off&amp;biw=2222&amp;bih=1170&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=Stay+hungry%2C+stay+foolish+meme&amp;oq=Stay+hungry%2C+stay+foolish+meme&amp;gs_l=img.3...12704.12859.0.12974.2.2.0.0.0.0.54.80.2.2.0.cprnk%2Ctoken%3Doa...0...1.1j2.64.img..0.1.54...0.c2jp1Q61ywE\">meme</a>. So what did the phrase mean to Jobs? \u201cBy the time he was espousing it, he was quite wealthy and powerful and I think aware of the innovator\u2019s dilemma where you can put yourself out of business by not continuing to undermine your own work,\u201d says Brand. \u201cAnd \u2018stay hungry, stay foolish\u2019 was possibly a formula for him to keep coming up with the next thing. Even when the last thing was successful, he thought he was going to be destroyed by it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many of the originators of San Francisco\u2019s counter- culture headed out to live on communes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/15/steve-jobs-man-in-the-machine-first-look-review-apple-founders-sour-side\">documentary Alex Gibney made about Steve Jobs</a> posited that, while Jobs was heavily influenced by the counterculture, he had ultimately used it to create machines humanity now can\u2019t live without, rather than to enlighten society or himself. Brand, who got to know Jobs after the Stanford speech, disagrees.</p> <p>\u201cI think Steve was pretty enlightened by the end. Like everyone, once he got married, everybody said the cruelty went out of him and the kids humanised him enormously, so the ferocity became less sincere. But in terms of what he did and how he did it, I wouldn\u2019t fault him.

He was definitely a pro from early on.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/19/anatomy-of-an-artwork-warhol-self-portrait-1981\">Andy Warhol\u2019s Self-Portrait With Platinum Bouffant Wig</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead, Garcia points to another figure as one of the counterculture\u2019s true heroes, his relative <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia\">Jerry Garcia</a>, leader of the Grateful Dead, still America\u2019s biggest cult band when they staged their <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/grateful-dead-end-50-year-career-with-moving-magnificent-final-show-20150706\">farewell concerts last year</a> (Jerry died in 1995). He points to the fact that the Grateful Dead were so community-minded that they even had an enclave at their concerts where audience members could stand and tape the shows. \u201cThey were experimental, avant garde and they literally allowed people to record their concerts,\u201d says Garcia. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, at a time when you were making money selling records, to let people make their own. So they were giving and they were experimenting and they were assisting, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/15/the-night-i-got-high-with-jerry-garcia\">anyone who could get a hold of Jerry would probably end up jamming back at their place for five or six days</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Communal, giving and peaceable, it\u2019s an ethos that still resonates, particularly in an ever more atomised, bad-tempered world. While the tens of thousands that headed out to the communes eventually came home, the sharing and free love proving more fraught than they had imagined, the ideals still have a powerful allure, as strange yet somehow comforting as the chorus of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_in_the_Sky_with_Diamonds\">Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds</a>. Although San Francisco is now one of the most expensive places on Earth, it\u2019s still the home of dreams and big ideas, a reminder that other worlds are possible.</p> <p>\u2022You Say You Want a Revolution?

  "<p>We know that pain thresholds vary from person to person \u2013 one person\u2019s nudging inconvenience is another\u2019s unbearable distraction \u2013 but the colour of your skin, in the US at least, can be a factor in deciding whether or not you receive pain medication.</p> <p>New <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0159224\">research from the US</a> shows that black patients who arrive at emergency rooms complaining of back or abdominal pain are significantly less likely to be given opioid painkillers, such as codeine, than their white counterparts, even when pain levels and insurance coverage are the same. Pain is the most common reason Americans visit the ER, and the researchers in Boston looked at five years\u2019 worth of records across the country for patients who had complained of general pain with an unclear cause.</p> <p>This effect has been found across healthcare settings \u2013 black children with appendicitis are significantly less likely get any painkillers for moderate pain or opioid-type drugs for severe pain. Doctors from the University of Pennsylvania reviewed 20 years\u2019 worth of studies in 2012 and found the same, calling this \u201cthe treatment gap\u201d. The review\u2019s lead author, Dr Salimah Meghani, says that to stop the disparity, doctors need to be educated about its cause, and this is most likely unconscious bias. The problem, she says, \u201cmay be addressed by helping health providers identify their blind spots\u201d.</p> <p>In April, <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/03/30/1516047113.full.pdf\">another study found </a>that half the white medical students surveyed believed at least one false statement about black people having \u201cthicker skin\u201d, \u201cfaster-coagulating blood\u201d or \u201cless sensitive nerve endings\u201d. Medics who believed one of these facts also rated black pain lower when viewing case studies. Authors of this research believed it was down to these entrenched ideas about \u201cbiological differences\u201d between races that may be informing doctors\u2019 decisions on when to prescribe.</p> <p>Dr Austin Leach, a pain medicine consultant who serves on the council of the <a href=\"https://www.britishpainsociety.org/\">British Pain Society</a>, says there is no biological reason for different prescriptions. \u201cPhysiological studies suggest that pain perception is the same across ethnicities,\u201d he says, adding that there is no evidence that this happens in the UK. Some races are predisposed to certain illnesses \u2013 the rate of strokes for African Americans is double that of the country\u2019s white population \u2013 but the treatment of pain should be the same.</p> <p>In this latest study, researchers claim that a particular type of unconscious bias \u2013 assuming that black patients are abusing meds \u2013 is to blame, despite the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/25/opioid-epidemic-prescription-painkillers-heroin-addiction\">opioid abuse is more prevalent in white communities</a>.</p> <p>The study\u2019s lead author, Dr Astha Singhal, a professor at Boston University, says the key point is that they found a discrepancy only in vague pain-related conditions, commonly associated with drug-seeking behaviour, rather than conditions with obvious causes, such as bone fractures. \u201cWhile the disparity we found is surely not a good thing, it might have indirect advantage to the black patients of minimising their exposure to opioids,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The theory that black communities are being \u201cshielded\u201d from opioid addiction by not being prescribed the drugs in the first place is a controversial one. Other studies have shown that diagnosis of issues from <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17157782\">back pain</a> to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2766845/\">cancer</a> is slower for black patients. The line is unclear to many doctors, including Singhal. \u201cIt raises the question \u2013 is it still an advantage if the cost is bearing untreated or undertreated pain?\u201d</p> <p></p>",
