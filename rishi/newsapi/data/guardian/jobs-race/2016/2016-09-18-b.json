  "<p>Neighbours of a 10-year-old boy who was injured in an alleged racist attack on a Bristol street have raised more than \u00a3400 to send him on a day trip.</p> <p>Awais Ali was walking to a friend\u2019s house to play video games when two older boys allegedly called him \u201cPaki\u201d and demanded he hand over his phone and money. </p> <p>He did not have any cash and the boys allegedly dragged him to a disused building in the Fishponds area where they hit him with a stick and with a rubber or plastic pipe.</p> <p>Ali sustained injuries to his head, ribs, shoulder blades, his left leg and arms and had a trainer mark imprinted on his back from where the boys allegedly stood on him.</p> <p> His mother, Anisa Iqbal, 33, whose family moved from Pakistan 50 years ago, was so shocked and upset that she allowed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/07/mother-of-boy-allegedly-beaten-in-racist-attack-releases-images-of-his-injuries\">images of the boy\u2019s injuries</a> to be released. </p> <p>A neighbour, Caryl Rundle, set up a <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/For-Awais\">Justgiving page</a> to give Awais a day out, explaining that she wanted to show the family that their neighbourhood was behind them. She said: \u201cWhat is important is that the community stands together to say no to racism and to support those who are affected by it.\u201d</p> <p>Rundle said she had been overwhelmed by the response to the fundraising campaign. They exceeded their goal of \u00a3200 four hours after setting up the page and are in discussions with the family about how best to donate the excess. </p> <p>\u201cI was, like many others, very shocked to hear of this attack. The fact all involved are so young is even more concerning. Fishponds, where I\u2019ve lived for the last 19 years, is a vibrant and multicultural area,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Police have questioned two boys, aged 11 and 12, and the case has been referred to the youth justice panel for consideration.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cAs a general rule,\u201d it was written in the 1920s, \u201cNegroes have not been and are not thought of in America when you talk in general terms of Americans unless they are specifically pointed out.\u201d This \u201cgeneral forgetfulness\u201d therefore made it \u201cnecessary for those interested in fair play to all citizens\u201d to propose a \u201cbeautiful building\u201d to \u201cdepict the negro\u2019s contribution to America in military service, in art, literature, invention, science, industry etc.\u201d</p> <p>The text was part of a century-long campaign, started by black civil war veterans in 1915, that will reach its fulfilment on Saturday, when Barack Obama formally opens the <a href=\"https://nmaahc.si.edu/\">National Museum of African American History and Culture</a> in Washington DC. It describes with some precision what has finally been achieved. It also suggests what the museum\u2019s director, Lonnie Bunch, says over and over: that the museum should give \u201ca fuller understanding of what it means to be American\u201d seen through the \u201cparticular lens\u201d of black experiences and contributions, not a place that is just about and for an anthropologically defined category known as African Americans.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Because of restrictions on the above-ground volume of buildings on the National Mall, 60% of the museum is buried</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The moment, of course, is charged. A short walk away another building has opened in the heart of the federal administrative district: the chandelier-bedecked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/trump-international-hotel-washington-opening-protests\">Trump International hotel</a>, a possible encampment on the way to the White House for the man keen on the plainly racist fantasy that Obama was not really American-born, and who as a young property tycoon was accused of denying homes to black applicants. Trump\u2019s combinations of obfuscation, cunning, bluster and force follow a pattern seen across the centuries in the museum\u2019s accounts of the ways in which black freedom and advancement were blocked.</p> <p>The museum, the 19th to be created by the Smithsonian Institution, enacts further principles currently under attack, which are the importance of knowledge and fact, scrupulously gathered, and of shared spaces for their understanding. It is much for a single building and its contents to carry, especially one placed on the National Mall in Washington amid the icons of the nation \u2013 the White House, the Capitol, great museums, memorials to wars and presidents. \u201cHow does one compete with such a monumental landscape?\u201d asks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/aug/02/david-adjaye-interview-not-always-looking-at-usual-references\">David Adjaye</a>, the lead designer of an architectural team formed out of four practices for the purpose of this project called Freelon Adjaye Bond/SmithGroup.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d0152daeabc3349ce418a75ee554a693a6e489b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0152daeabc3349ce418a75ee554a693a6e489b9/2476_1857_3090_1854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"British architect David Adjaye, the lead designer on the Washington museum project.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">British architect David Adjaye, the lead designer on the Washington museum project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Leynse/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This team is led by people of predominantly African American heritage, a rarity in the still very white profession of architecture, such as the lead architect Phil Freelon and the project leader Zena Howard. J Max Bond, a pioneer among black architects, was part of the group but died before the museum was finished. Adjaye is British, born in Tanzania to Ghanaian parents. The theme and content of the museum is therefore personal. \u201cAs a young boy of my generation the African American story was also our story,\u201d says Adjaye, who was born as the civil rights movement was gathering force in 1966, \u201cin the sense that it was the techniques, the motivation, it was a way of being and it was a way of understanding that one could succeed in the modern world and not be oppressed by it. I feel it as part of my emerging into adulthood and being who I am.\u201d</p> <p>It is indeed the content that should come before the architecture of the building that serves it. It includes artefacts of desperation and sheer survival, such as the shards of tools used by Maroons \u2013 escaped slaves \u2013 in their refuge in the Great Dismal Swamp of North Carolina. Also of violence, such as leg irons, and fragments of glass from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/alabama-board-denies-parole-klansman-birmingham-church-bombing\">1963 bombing that killed four young girls</a> in the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. There is exaltation, in the form of one of Chuck Berry\u2019s bright red Cadillacs, of the recollected triumphs of Muhammad Ali, of the orange silk jacket and recorded singing of the contralto Marian Anderson. There is abundant film and photography of the struggles and grotesqueries of racial politics, such as the Ku Klux Klan march through Washington in 1925.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97fb3066809f1cad24263b7cae8aad2110f10f98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97fb3066809f1cad24263b7cae8aad2110f10f98/0_0_3500_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The patterns of the museum\u2019s filigree, bronze-finished screens derive from the decorative metalwork created by African American craftsmen in cities such as New Orleans and Charleston.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The patterns of the museum\u2019s filigree, bronze-finished screens derive from the decorative metalwork created by African American craftsmen in cities such as New Orleans and Charleston.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scraps of intimacy and poverty are interspersed with larger structures, such as wooden cabins inhabited by slaves and a watchtower from Angola prison in Louisiana. Objects of American transport technology contribute: a segregated railway carriage, a bright yellow-and-blue biplane used by the African American Tuskegee airmen, that Cadillac. Eventually you find the P-Funk Mothership, a spoof spacecraft that used to land on stage on the 1970s stadium tours of George Clinton and his band Parliament-Funkadelic.</p> <p>The collection is remarkable for the fact that, little more than a decade ago, it didn\u2019t exist. Lonnie Bunch, on taking up his post in 2005, was armed with a Bush-signed act of Congress that supported the idea of the museum, but he had nothing to put in it. This could have been catastrophic, as the world is full of unconvincing museums founded on ideas but little content. So Bunch and his team toured the nation, inviting people to offer whatever they might have. The result is personal, eclectic, touching and surprising, rather than encyclopedic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"455288523531fb361d1586c6be06b5ccbbee7797\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/455288523531fb361d1586c6be06b5ccbbee7797/0_0_3000_1999/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The culture galleries at the Smithsonian Institute\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The culture galleries at the Smithsonian Institute\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The displays are sometimes overcrowded but avoid gimmicks and pointless gestures at interaction. They are text-heavy, partly to fill the gaps that arise from the nature of the collection, with a measured and sober tone. The exhibits are arranged in three main sections, starting with a narrative history, rising up from the bottom of a deep basement, that runs from the beginnings of the Atlantic slave trade in 15th-century Africa and Europe to the presidency of Barack Obama. On two upper floors, above the ground level entrance hall, are the community galleries, which talk about such things as religion, place, sport and military service, and the culture galleries, which show art, music, literature and performance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ad1cfa21a43f4e0813f82d4acbe33b5eace11a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ad1cfa21a43f4e0813f82d4acbe33b5eace11a4/397_130_2428_2031/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Slave shackles on display at the museum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"836\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Slave shackles on display at the museum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The museum thus climbs from slave ships to the mothership, an ascendant trajectory that maybe doesn\u2019t do enough to avoid an oversimplified story of oppression ultimately redeemed by blues, funk and hip-hop. The museum nonetheless does an outstanding job of giving due weight to horrors and heroism, to people just living their lives and to the endless repeating stories of creativity prompted by oppression. Many of the histories are familiar even to non-Americans, such as that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/oct/25/guardianobituaries.usa\">Rosa Parks</a>, but they are shown here with new weight. You are assailed by the mental force of something pushing from the back of your mind to the front. Was segregation really so cruel, so laughably hypocritical, so absurdly rigged and transparently unfair? Yes, it was.</p> <p>The official story of the design is already much told and doubtless will be repeated to the museum\u2019s visitors for as long as it stands. The triple-decker superstructure of inverted truncated pyramids recalls the celebratory headpieces on certain Yoruba sculptures from west Africa and can also evoke, if you like, arms raised in celebration. They are made of bronze-finished aluminium whose filigree patterns derive from the decorative metalwork created by African American craftsmen in cities such as New Orleans and Charleston. A long, deep canopy that shelters the main entrance refers to the porches of southern houses that acted as social and political centres, little village halls, informal schools.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0e3475e1f955b40c48164de9928365ac2e81540d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e3475e1f955b40c48164de9928365ac2e81540d/0_0_2698_3600/749.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the National Museum of African American History and Culture.\" width=\"749\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside the National Museum of African American History and Culture.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Karchmer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These narratives are necessary, says Adjaye, for a project that was \u201cdefinitely not done quietly on a mountain somewhere on my own\u201d but had to \u201cnegotiate a lot of positions and opinions to get this form. So it was really important that this was neither cloaked nor hidden. It was something that had to be absolutely clear and people had to understand why.\u201d</p> <p>But such stories only get a building so far. They could describe an exhilarating work or a cringe-making one. What matters more are the relationships the architecture makes through its space and material between exhibits, people and surroundings.</p> <p>Here there are tensions between the institutional nature of a museum and its popular ambitions, between a search for authenticity and the tendency of modern museums to resemble shopping malls \u2013 shiny, escalatored \u2013 driven as they are by mall-like considerations of people moving and browsing. The design also has to deal with the contemporary habit of putting exhibitions in sealed boxes, where air and light are perfectly controlled, which makes for abrupt transitions with the rest of the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It achieves its main, difficult task, which is to be both American and African American</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One technique that Adjaye tries is to create moments of crowd-pleasing charm \u2013 a particular tone of purplish pink terrazzo in the entrance hall\u2019s floor, coppery panels on the lifts, outbreaks of decoration as in an art deco cinema, something as simple as the rich blue over the entrance to the Oprah Winfrey theatre. There is an agile open loop of a spiral staircase going down to the basement, which also helps you forget that \u2013 because of restrictions on the above-ground volume of buildings on the National Mall \u2013 60% of the museum is buried. You might imagine something non-Caucasian in these hues and motifs, but at any rate they are different from the greys and creams of most Smithsonian museums.</p> <p>More substantially the building seeks to connect with its august surroundings, through views from decks outside the upper galleries that are sometimes filtered through the filigree screens and sometimes through openings specially oriented to particular monuments. The glass-walled ground floor allows views in all directions of both greenery and stone-pillared official architecture. At this point it feels embracing and inclusive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66b0450bbb04ba5f04a33b415648e2201ea290a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66b0450bbb04ba5f04a33b415648e2201ea290a7/0_0_4481_2987/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A first world war helmet of the US Army\u2019s 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the Harlem Hellfighters, on display at the museum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A first world war helmet of the US Army\u2019s 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the Harlem Hellfighters, on display at the museum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Preston Keres/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hardest job the design has to do is to find a way to stand on its grand stage. It is placed at a corner where the grand axis emanating from the Capitol intersects at a right angle with that emanating from the White House, a cross pinned at its centre by the 555ft obelisk of the Washington monument. All around are white stone commemorations of white men, albeit often built with black labour. As a freestanding largely symmetrical object, the new museum has something in common with its neighbours, but as a dark-clad structure that eschews classical columns for apparently floating horizontal layers, it does not. Its suggestion of pyramids gives a geometrical echo of the obelisk (which, lest we forget, is Egyptian and therefore also African), but their inversion sets them apart.</p> <p>Adjaye doesn\u2019t mind if a link is made between the dark skin of the building and that of the people it remembers, but he gives another reason for it. If it is not the main material for buildings on the National Mall, bronze is nonetheless used for the memorial detail of statuary and plaques. The role of the new museum is itself partly memorial, the idea having started off a century ago with the primary intent of honouring black soldiers. The bronze finish, for Adjaye, is \u201cabsolutely from the classical family, but to express different ideas seemed like the right thing to do\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca59259401bdaf675eb3bcbf4b6df0fbf80b1414\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca59259401bdaf675eb3bcbf4b6df0fbf80b1414/0_469_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The National Museum of African American History and Culture flanked by the Washington monument, right.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The National Museum of African American History and Culture flanked by the Washington monument, right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Karchmer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It takes some nerve to do a building like this, on this spot, and the design is confident enough to pull it off. It is not flawless, as it sometimes feels assembled or panellised more than crafted. The bronze-coloured screens are not the delicate, seamless things suggested in computer visualisations. The build-up of the exterior cladding \u2013 glass wall plus screen plus substantial fixings for the latter \u2013 impedes the sense of connection between inside and out. There are moments of gawkiness that can be engaging or uncomfortable, depending on your taste. But it achieves its main, difficult task, which is to be both American and African American, and to be of its location but also different from it.</p> <p>As a museum and as a building it enacts the tone that is so striking in the 1928 text \u2013 its patience, reason and lack of rancour. It realises qualities of America at its best, ones which, as is now abundantly clear, we can\u2019t take for granted.</p> <h2><br></h2> <h2>A century of waiting: the long campaign for the museum</h2> <p>The new National Museum of African American History and Culture is the result of more than a century of efforts to commemorate the contributions of African Americans to their country.</p> <p><strong>1915</strong> A group of civil war veterans, gathered to mark the 50th anniversary of its ending, organise a \u201ccommittee of colored citizens\u201d to build a monument.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5c959639ea78bb30518af9bf1f16b3ece7548584\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c959639ea78bb30518af9bf1f16b3ece7548584/0_0_1078_1066/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A badge showing the unbuilt 1920s design for what has now become the National Museum of African American History.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"989\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A badge showing the unbuilt 1920s design for what has now become the National Museum of African American History.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Wainwright</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1929 </strong>Congress permits a national commission to be set up, but it fails for lack of funding.</p> <p><strong>1968 </strong>Black leaders unsuccessfully press Congress for a museum.</p> <p><strong>1985 </strong>The owner of a bus-tour company, Tom Mack, starts a fundraising group.</p> <p><strong>1988 </strong>Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights veteran, unsuccessfully introduces a bill for a museum.
