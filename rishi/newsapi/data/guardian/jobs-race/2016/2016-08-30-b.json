  "<p> MPs are demanding urgent government action to tackle a \u201cshocking and unacceptable\u201d rise in workplace discrimination in the UK against expectant and new mothers over the last decade.</p> <p>A report published by the women and equalities select committee called for Britain to put in place protection similar to that in Germany, where pregnant women can only be made redundant in certain circumstances. <br></p> <p>The MPs also expressed concern for casual, agency and zero-hours workers, who they said were more likely to report risks to their health and safety, and more likely to leave their employer because of those risks not being resolved. The government should review the maternity and pregnancy rights of this group, they said.</p> <p>The report, published on Wednesday, recommended individual risk assessments, to help reduce the number of women, 25%, who left their jobs because health and safety concerns regarding pregnancy and maternity were not met.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jun/12/discrimination-work-pregnant-new-mothers-forced-out-jobs\">Workplace discrimination: when a pregnant pause becomes more long-term</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The committee chair, Maria Miller, said: \u201cThe arrival of a new baby puts family finances under extreme pressure yet, despite this, thousands of expectant and new mothers have no choice but to leave their work because of concerns about the safety of their child or pregnancy discrimination. Shockingly, this figure has almost doubled in the last decade, now standing at 54,000 each year.</p> <p>\u201cThere are now record numbers of women in work in the UK. The economy will suffer unless employers modernise their workplace practices to ensure effective support and protection for expectant and new mums.\u201d <br></p> <p>She criticised the government\u2019s response to its own findings in March, which showed that pregnancy discrimination, which is illegal, was worse now than in 2005. </p> <p>\u201cThe government\u2019s approach has lacked urgency and bite,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt needs to set out a detailed plan outlining the specific actions it will take to tackle this unacceptable level of discrimination. This work must be underpinned by concrete targets and changes to laws and protections to increase compliance by employers to improve women\u2019s lives.\u201d</p> <p>Currently, 77% of pregnant women and new mothers <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/22/fifth-of-women-harassed-at-work-over-pregnancy-or-flexible-hours-report-finds\">experience discrimination at work</a>, compared with 45% 10 years ago and 11% lost their jobs, according to the study by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission in March.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe find it shocking that the number of new and expectant mothers feeling forced out of their job has nearly doubled in the past decade,\u201d the report on Wednesday said. \u201cIt is difficult to accept the EHRC\u2019s characterisation of this as solely an issue of misinterpretation of the law.\u201d<br></p> <p>The report recommended greater protections, including changes in the law, paid time off for antenatal appointments for all workers, and a reduction in the current fee of \u00a31,200 to take a case to a tribunal, which discourages those discriminated against to seek justice.</p> <p>In Germany, a dismissal ban prevents redundancies for pregnant employees except in rare cases, such as gross misconduct by the worker, or the employer getting into severe financial difficulties resulting in multiple job losses. </p> <p>Pregnancy discrimination in the UK is present across all industries and income brackets, studies have found. However, differences do exist. For instance, those on low incomes tend to face discrimination when pregnant, while those on higher incomes tend to experience discrimination on their return to work.</p> <p>A recent survey of Mumsnet users found <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.mumsnet.com/jobs/the-employers-who-wont-hire-women-mumsnet-survey-women-attitudes\">a fifth of mothers had been asked at a job interview how they would manage childcare</a> if they got the job.</p> <p>Rosalind Bragg, the director of Maternity Action, who gave evidence to the committee, described the report as a roadmap to help tackle the issue.</p> <p> Implementing its recommendations could \u201creverse the increase in discrimination\u201d and move towards a situation where pregnancy discrimination was rare, she said.</p> <p>Elizabeth Duff, a senior policy adviser for the National Childbirth Trust, said: \u201cWomen in the 21st century should never fear making the choice between having a career and a family. Action to address this mistreatment is long overdue.\u201d </p> <p>Catherine Rayner, of the Discrimination Law Association, told the committee the rise in the number of women in casual, agency and zero-hours work might be one reason for the doubling of discrimination.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThere are huge swaths of women, particularly in some of the caring industries, who are treated not as employees but as workers and therefore do not necessarily access the (same) rights.\u201d </p> <p>The birthrights organisation said poorer women were at the greatest risk of having a stillbirth, dying in childbirth or suffering complications. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIt is vital that the law protects these women \u2013 some of whom are in casual, agency work or on zero-hours contracts where they are unable to access protected time for vital antenatal appointments. <br></p> <p>\u201cIf vulnerable women cannot attend antenatal appointments because of concerns about missing work, this may put them and their babies at serious risk.\u201d</p> <p>The EHRC\u2019s deputy chair, Caroline Waters, said the commission was pleased the committee had adopted its recommendations to improve access to justice, \u201ccalling for an extension on the three-month time limit for tribunal claims, and tackling the barriers caused by high tribunal fees\u201d.</p> <p>In her response to the committee\u2019s report, Business Minister Margot James stressed that discrimination in the workplace is illegal.</p> <p>James said: \u201cIt is completely unacceptable that pregnant women and new mothers are apparently being forced to quit their jobs because of outdated attitudes.</p> <p>\u201cTackling this issue is a key priority of mine and this government and I would like to thank the committee for its important work. We will consider its recommendations carefully and respond in due course.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018It came as a complete shock\u2019<br></h2> <p>Rebecca Raven was sacked from her \u00a321,000-a-year job teaching art at a private school after telling the headmistress she wanted to take maternity leave. </p> <p>An employment tribunal later ruled that Raven, who was represented by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, had been unfairly dismissed by Howell\u2019s School, in Denbigh, north Wales. In 2012 the school was ordered to pay Raven \u00a334,000 in compensation, but she said that, so far, she hasn\u2019t seen a penny. </p> <p>The 36-year-old from Wrexham, who now runs her own business, said: \u201cThere is discrimination law and equality law, but employers are getting away with flouting it.\u201d</p> <p>She recalls being told by one of the school trustees that they did not want to \u201cwaste money on maternity pay\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI was very clued up. I had been previously self-employed and I knew my rights. But I was made to feel like a criminal. It came as a complete shock. When you are pregnant, you are emotional anyway, but the whole thing put me under a lot of pressure.\u201d<br></p> <p>She welcomed the report\u2019s findings, in particular the recommendation for a reduction in tribunal fees, which have risen in recent years.</p>",

The campaign group was originally formed in the US in response to police shootings of black people.</p> <p>\u201cMy clients feel that they have been targeted because of the colour of their skin,\u201d Haroon Shah, the solicitor representing the four, told the Guardian. He argues that the bail conditions were disproportionately harsh.</p> <p>Nottinghamshire police said they could not comment on the allegations due to the ongoing court proceedings.</p> <p>The initial bail conditions, which prevented the four accused from contacting each other or taking part in any organised protest, were lifted following representations from Shah. </p> <p>The presiding magistrate, John Lock, agreed to lift the conditions and released the four on unconditional bail until their next hearing on 6 September.</p> <p>\u201cThe day after they were arrested there was an [English Defence League] march where all the tram lines were shut down and sections of the city were brought to a standstill at the cost to the taxpayer to the tune of about \u00a3200,000,\u201d said Shah. </p> <p>\u201cObviously [the anti-racism protesters] feel aggrieved that nothing is done in relation to those people that are marching, where there was basically a shutdown of the whole [city centre], and yet when they\u2019re trying to make their [protest], they are then arrested for obstructing the highway.\u201d</p> <p>On 6 August, extra officers were drafted in from forces across the country \u2013 including Greater Manchester, Durham and Lancashire \u2013 to policethe protest by the far-right EDL and a counter-protest by anti-fascist groups.</p> <p>Nottinghamshire\u2019s police and crime commissioner, Paddy Tipping, estimated that the entire operation would cost the force around \u00a3200,000. Five arrests were made, with three people released without charge and another two given court dates.</p> <p>Shah acknowledged that, unlike the EDL demonstrators, his clients had not obtained permission from the police to hold their protest, but he said that although both groups had similar objectives, to protest, he believes his clients were treated differently to the EDL supporters. </p> <p>The national day of action this month was timed to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the death of Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by police, sparking nationwide riots. An inquest found that Duggan, 29, had been \u201clawfully killed\u201d.</p> <p>Protesters blocked the roads leading to Heathrow and Birmingham airports. Police in London arrested 10 protesters, while West Midlands police arrested five.</p> <p>A statement from the group, released on the day of the protests said: \u201cThis morning UKBLM have #Shutdown roads in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Nottingham to mourn those who have died in custody and to protest the ongoing racist violence of the police, border enforcement, structural inequalities and the everyday indignity of street racism.\u201d</p> <p>The group highlighted statistics showing that black people are far more likely to die in police custody. They are up to 37 times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people and three times more likely to be arrested than white people.</p>",

Woolfe has remained silent since his exclusion, beyond accepting the party\u2019s ruling.<br></p> <p>The loss of Woolfe is seen by his allies as the product of a wider power struggle within the party, in which a national executive committee hostile to Farage is seeking to exclude his favourites.</p> <p>Carswell, who represents Clacton in parliament, dismissed this. \u201cWe\u2019re not big enough to have wings,\u201d he told the Guardian at the hustings. \u201cWe\u2019re an anti-establishment movement. We need to grow up and become a party that\u2019s bigger than one person.

Institutions, too, have to focus on \u201cemployability\u201d, usually reduced to the proportion of their students who find \u201cgraduate\u201d jobs. In the looming Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) this will be a key <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jul/21/higher-education-student-debt-teaching-excellence-framework-tef-jo-johnson\">indicator of their performance</a>.</p> <p>Whole nations now justify public investment in higher education almost entirely in terms of enhancing the skills of graduate workers, as well as more \u201cimpactful\u201d research. Competition in the global knowledge economy is the new Olympian struggle, with growth rates and gross national product substituting for medals.</p> <p>But just because over the past two decades the growth in the proportion of \u201cgraduate\u201d jobs roughly kept pace with the increasing production of graduates there is no guarantee this will happen in future. The recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/18/gap-between-graduate-and-non-graduate-wages-shows-signs-of-waning\">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a> report found that the \u201cgraduate premium\u201d, the extra earnings graduates can expect compared with non-graduates, has held up \u2013 so far. It offered no reassurances about the future.</p> <p>Because older non-graduates are retiring and being replaced by graduates, the proportion of graduates in the workforce will go on increasing even if there is no growth in student numbers (and the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service has reported a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/19/ucas-considers-radical-changes-as-clearing-rates-rise-sharply\">4% increase in first years </a>this autumn).</p> <p>There is already alarming anecdotal evidence that the increase in \u201cgraduate\u201d jobs is failing to keep pace. Lots of graduates end up in the Uber economy. In any case, the \u201cgraduate premium\u201d has always been uneven \u2013 high for Oxbridge graduates heading for the City, wafer-thin for those from less prestigious universities working in the public sector (especially if they are women or from ethnic minorities).</p> <p>Ministers will be tempted to heap blame on these less prestigious universities, naming and shaming them and penalising them in the TEF in the name of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/sep/09/lamentable-teaching-damaging-higher-education-jo-johnson-minister-warns\">driving up standards</a>\u201d. But that will be pointless and deeply unfair if the \u201cgraduate\u201d jobs don\u2019t exist in sufficient quantity. It is worth remembering that the growth in such jobs in the past was fuelled by incorporating the education of most healthcare and primary school teachers into the graduate economy.</p> <p>The anecdotal evidence that the explosion of \u201cgraduate\u201d jobs may be over is already there. The scientific evidence is slowly becoming available, notably in a paper by Stephen Kemp-King, The Graduate Premium: manna, myth or plain mis-selling?, published by the <a href=\"http://www.if.org.uk/archives/8403/the-graduate-premium-manna-myth-or-plain-mis-selling\">Intergenerational Foundation</a>. There are lots of reasons. Top of the list is the government\u2019s refusal to embrace a high-skill industrial strategy, preferring the quick fix of a liberalised, and lower-wage, workforce.</p> <p>Another reason is that many of the \u201cgraduate\u201d jobs generated in management and financial services, even though they are filled by graduates from our now ubiquitous \u201ctop\u201d universities, are rather \u201csoft\u201d. They may \u2013 may \u2013 demand those sometimes over-hyped problem-solving and inter-personal skills. But they often don\u2019t need high-level expert and technical skills. Not really very \u201cgraduate\u201d on one reading.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jun/03/less-than-half-of-students-confident-their-degree-will-pay-for-itself\">Less than half of students confident their degree will pay for itself</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then there are longer-term structural reasons. Some fear high-skill jobs are being hollowed out, as the need for truly advanced skills is becoming more and more concentrated in a few very high-tech sectors (often abroad). Others suggest our existing advanced technologies are becoming mature, and may cease to devour graduates in the way they once did.</p> <p>If the graduate job market does falter, there are two responses. The first, and much the most likely from government, is to increase the pressure on universities, insisting that the fit between higher education and employment becomes even more exact. That is probably a battle that can never be won.</p> <p>The second is to recognise that a higher education is about more than jobs. It is about self worth and citizenship too. So even if the supply of \u201cgraduate\u201d jobs does fail to keep up with the production of graduates, there is no need to panic. A good society is more than just an ever-expanding economy.</p>",
  "<p>As an essential part of any job hunt, interviews are often seen as the perfect opportunity to put your best foot forward and show your skills. But in reality it\u2019s usually the time you find yourself most on edge. As nerves begin to set in, it\u2019s easy to become distracted by the interviewer\u2019s rapid note-taking and wonder what on earth they are writing. But the secret to interview success comes down to more than just keeping your cool.</p> <p>To make the best possible impression, it\u2019s helpful to understand what the interviewer is really looking for. With this in mind, here are three questions every interviewer ponders as you sit opposite them.</p> <h2>Would you fit in here?</h2> <p>The interviewer will be trying to picture you in the role, working alongside the current team and considering how well you\u2019re likely to fit in. So you need to show how your personality is a good match.</p> <p>As you can imagine, a startup with just three employees who are all senior managers will have a very different feel to a small agency of 20-somethings, or a business of more than 1,000 people. But even with research, it\u2019s often not possible to get an exact idea of the company culture until the interview itself.<br></p> <p>On interview day spend a few minutes taking in the working atmosphere \u2013 are the offices buzzing with noise and people taking time to have an informal chitchat, or is it almost silent with a more focused energy? Next, assess how your interviewer is coming across \u2013 are they following a more formal interview style or are they telling anecdotes and are more conversational? Then aim to mirror them.<br></p> <p>While you should always be professional, by taking note of all the above you\u2019ll have a better idea of which part of your personality to emphasise. Don\u2019t forget to also think about where your role fits into the team. If you\u2019re timid in an interview for an internal coordinator role, for example, the interviewer might be left questioning your ability to take charge.<br></p> <h2>Do you match your CV?</h2> <p>Up until this point, the interviewer already assumes you\u2019ll be a great match for the role \u2013 you now just need to keep them thinking this. Remember, your interviewer has no immediate way of knowing if your CV is true unless you have the evidence to back it up.</p> <p>Ahead of the interview, run through every point on your CV and apply the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/star-technique-competency-based-interview\">star technique</a> to give a wider context to the claims you\u2019ve made. By having this bank of detailed examples in mind, you\u2019ll be able to better explain how your experience transfers to the role.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/aug/23/ultimate-top-tips-for-job-interview-success\">Four top tips for job interview success</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Have you got what it takes?</h2> <p>Your interviewer will be looking to see how well you really understand the nature of the role and what you can expect to face.</p> <p>As part of your research, watch and read interviews with people in the industry talking about their daily working lives, taking note of the challenges and situations they come up against. This will help you build up a realistic idea of what you\u2019re likely to expect.</p> <p>At interview, you then just need to pair this knowledge with specific examples from your own experience. For example, in an interview for a project manager role, you may be asked a competency based question like: \u201cGive an example of a time you had to be diplomatic.\u201d Your response might be: \u201cI understand that a large element of this position can involve being the middleman in negotiating and finding compromises between different parties, which I\u2019ve faced in my previous role. For example when I \u2026\u201d Then give an example using the star technique.</p> <p>But it doesn\u2019t just come down to what you say. Use the interview as a chance to show firsthand that you have the relevant skills. For example, if the job involves talking to senior clients, make sure you come across as confident, but personable. Or perhaps the role will require you to listen and help with customer queries. In which case, show the interviewer your attention to detail by referring back to the things they say during the interview.</p> <p>The interviewer will also be using this time to work out how long you\u2019re going to stick around \u2013 they don\u2019t want to spend time investing in someone who will jump ship in a few months when a new opportunity comes along. If you have a history of job hopping, seem overqualified or are looking to relocate to the area, don\u2019t leave the interviewer to draw negative conclusions. Be sure to voice their potential concerns and explain why this job is different.</p> <p>Every interview is slightly different, so simply taking the time to put yourself in the interviewer\u2019s shoes and consider exactly what they\u2019re looking for, might be the key to your interview success.</p> <p><em></em></p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?
