  "<p>A black man who was shot dead by police officers called to a domestic altercation at his Florida home was \u201cexecuted\u201d as he sat eating chicken wings in his backyard, relatives claimed on Monday.</p> <p>Deputies from Broward sheriff\u2019s office shot Gregory Frazier, 55, multiple times outside the house in Pompano Beach on Friday night after a 911 call from his sister, who said he was threatening her and her daughter with a knife and \u201cbreaking up the house\u201d after a day of drinking.</p> <p>In the call, Deborah Frazier warned the dispatcher that her brother was wielding a Swiss army-style pocket knife.</p> <p>But Frazier\u2019s relatives insist he had regained his composure by the time the two officers arrived and was sitting calmly in the backyard eating chicken and fries when they approached him. </p> <p>Quartaze Woodard, Frazier\u2019s nephew, <a href=\"http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/news/bso-deputies-fatally-shoot-pompano-beach-man-who-was-eating-chicken-wings-updated-8072862\">told the Broward New Times</a> that the officers opened fire after his uncle twice refused an order to lie on the ground. </p> <p>Woodard said that the officers handcuffed Frazier after shooting him, then released the handcuffs and attempted to perform CPR once they realized he was unresponsive. </p> <p>Deborah Frazier, meanwhile, told the New Times that she regretted calling 911. \u201cI would never have called the cops if I\u2019d known this would happen. They just came in and started shooting right away,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Scott Israel, the Broward County sheriff, announced on Monday that he had asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate Frazier\u2019s death, along with another deputy-involved shooting in Pompano Beach earlier in the day that saw a motorist and traffic officer taken to hospital.</p> <p>In that incident, Israel said, a \u201croutine traffic stop\u201d turned violent when a driver reversed his car into a deputy and another officer fired his weapon at the motorist, striking him in the shoulder. Neither injury was life threatening. Israel said he planned to attend Monday night\u2019s community gathering to speak about both incidents.</p> <p>Earlier on Monday, Frazier\u2019s family had released a statement through the law firm of civil rights attorneys Daryl Parks and Benjamin Crump demanding answers.</p> <p>\u201cWe are working diligently with our legal team to determine exactly why police felt the need to execute him as he ate his supper in the backyard of his house rather than use negotiation tactics,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>\u201cWe will never forget Greg and we will fight so that his death will not be covered up.\u201d</p> <p>Crump, an attorney who rose to prominence when he represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager shot dead by neighbourhood watch leader George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida, in 2012, echoed the relatives\u2019 calls for information.</p> <p>\u201cThe family hopes that there is police body camera video or eyewitness evidence that can demonstrate whether this type of force, which they believe was excessive, was actually required,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason communities of color around America are so enraged is because it seems to be a \u2018shoot first, ask question later\u2019 scenario when it comes to police interactions with people from our neighbourhood.\u201d</p> <p>Friends and relatives were due to attend a community rally at the Greater Bethel Baptist church in Pompano Beach later on Monday to pay their respects to Frazier, a landscaper, with family members and religious leaders planning to address the crowd.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/corey-jones-police-fatal-shooting-florida-grand-jury\">Police officer to face grand jury in killing of black man on Florida highway</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Veda Coleman-Wright, a spokeswoman for the BSO, said the two unnamed deputies had been placed on administrative leave while detectives continued to investigate the case.</p> <p>\u201cWhen deputies arrived, someone in the house directed them to the backyard where they encountered the subject who produced a knife.

While Zuckerberg continues to insist that his corporation is a \u201cplatform\u201d and \u201ctech company\u201d \u2013 and not a media site or publisher \u2013 the reality is that Facebook has <a href=\"http://www.journalism.org/2016/05/26/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2016/\">become</a> a primary news source for many users and a vital tool for reporters.</p> <p>Facebook\u2019s expanding power in the media business has created anxiety for news publishers, who have lost ad revenue as a result and have lamented how Facebook\u2019s algorithms can drive or <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-02-11/facebook-puts-a-downer-on-upworthy\">kill traffic to news sites</a>.</p> <p>The temporary ban against King offers a reminder of how much control Facebook has \u2013 and how the site doesn\u2019t always get it right when choosing what content to allow or reject.</p> <p>\u201cI love Facebook. It\u2019s a huge part of what I do every day,\u201d King said in an interview. \u201cFacebook is as important to me as my laptop.\u201d</p> <p>So when King saw he could no longer post, it was startling.</p> <p>\u201cThis thing that I had taken 10 years to build, this community with over 800,000 people \u2026 to think that with a keystroke or a computer filter, that could be shut down, it\u2019s a weird feeling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/774306559010676736\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;ve been banned from Facebook. <br><br>Yeah, really. <br><br>Was a guest speaker there earlier this year. <br><br>FOOLISHNESS. <a href=\"https://t.co/TVRU0FEoV6\">pic.twitter.com/TVRU0FEoV6</a></p>&mdash; Shaun King (@ShaunKing) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/774306559010676736\">September 9, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>King, who was a guest speaker at Facebook earlier this year to discuss Black Lives Matter, said he reached out directly to people he knows at the Silicon Valley company.</p> <p>He said that roughly six or seven hours after he was banned, the company restored his access. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/shaunking/photos/a.799605230078397.1073741828.799539910084929/1135506076488309/?type=3&amp;theater\">Facebook wrote</a> to him: \u201cThis was a mistake, and we sincerely apologize for the error.\u201d A team member had \u201caccidentally\u201d removed his post, the message said.</p> <p>For regular users without direct connections to Facebook, the outcome could have been different, King said.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people who do exactly what I did get suspended, and they don\u2019t have somebody to contact.

They shut down their Facebook page that they let me use.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has launched an unprecedented investigation into whether his predecessor broke EU rules by taking a job at Goldman Sachs.<br></p> <p>The EU executive has been under fire since it emerged in July that Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, who led the European commission between 2004 and 2014, was advising the US investment bank on Brexit.<br></p> <p>Barroso is now being asked to clarify his responsibilities at Goldman Sachs, according to a letter from Juncker to the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/06/eu-ethics-watchdog-intervenes-on-jose-manuel-barroso-goldman-job\"> EU ombudsman, Emily O\u2019Reilly</a>.<br></p> <p>The case has also been referred to an independent panel of EU experts, charged with investigating breaches of the EU\u2019s ethical code. The three-person panel is comprised of a former judge, a former vice-president of the European parliament and former top commission official.<br></p> <p>Under EU rules, commission officials have a duty to \u201cbehave with integrity and discretion\u201d once they have ceased to hold high office. As Juncker points out in his letter, this principle \u201chas no time limit and is performed in all cases\u201d.<br></p> <p>The letter also puts Barroso in his place, noting that he will not be received in the EU institutions as a former president, but as an \u201cinterest representative\u201d, who will be subject to the same rules as any other lobbyist. Although this line echoes earlier comments from commission officials, this is the first time that Juncker has made explicit the ban on red-carpet treatment.<br></p> <p>Barroso, a student Maoist-turned centre-right prime minister of Portugal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/08/jose-manuel-barroso-to-become-next-head-of-goldman-sachs-international\">took up the post of Brexit adviser at Goldman Sachs in July for an undisclosed sum</a>. His decision to join the US investment bank, which was implicated in the Greek debt crisis, prompted fury among rank-and-file EU staffers. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/29/eu-staff-petition-attacks-former-ec-president-over-goldman-sachs-job\">petition initiated by EU employees attacking Barroso\u2019s \u201cmorally reprehensible\u201d behaviour, has attracted close to 140,000 signatures</a>.<br></p> <p>The anonymous group of EU staff, who plan to present their petition to Juncker at the end of this month, were angry that the commission hierarchy did not condemn Barroso\u2019s bank job more forcefully. <br></p> <p>Juncker has convened the ethics panel just days before a major speech on Wednesday, where he will attempt to steady an uncertain and divided EU, still reeling from the Brexit vote and split over its response to the migration crisis.<br></p> <p>A spokesman for Goldman Sachs told the Wall Street Journal: \u201cGoldman Sachs have adhered to all applicable legal rules and the highest ethical standards in [Barroso\u2019s] appointment.\u201d</p> <p>Transparency campaigners called on Juncker to ensure the ethics panel convenes quickly with the aim of concluding its work within the next month.<br></p> <p>Carl Dolan, director of Transparency International\u2019s EU office, described the decision to call the ethics committee as \u201ca small victory\u201d for the thousands of EU citizens, including commission staff, that had signed the petition.<br></p> <p>He added: \u201cIn a case that will have a huge impact on the commission\u2019s integrity and reputation, the process needs to be swift and transparent. It\u2019s imperative that the committee\u2019s minutes, recommendations and the reasoning behind them are published as soon as possible.\u201d <br></p>",

In 2008, Barack Obama\u2019s doctor offered <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/president-obama-health-107797\">a 276-page report</a> about the senator, then 47, and John McCain, then 71 and <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/24/science/sci-melanoma24\">the survivor of several brushes with skin cancer</a>, made almost 1,200 pages of medical history available.</p> <p>Clinton can be expected to recover swiftly \u2013 pneumonia is a common illness that most people get over in about two weeks, though it can become dangerous for older people and infants. The infection typically develops after a cold or flu: Clinton\u2019s doctor said the former secretary of state was suffering from persistent allergies before the diagnosis. </p> <p>Dr Lisa R Bardack, of Mount Kisco Medical Group in New York, prescribed antibiotics and rest and advised Clinton change her schedule, which has sent her traveling almost daily around the US, often to the large fundraisers or rallies. That schedule was under discussion on Sunday.</p> <p>Campaigns can act as petri dishes for the politicians, aides and the reporters who attend them, and recent elections have seen several instances of candidates persevering through or bowing out over illness. </p> <p>The former US representative Michele Bachmann, for example, was an early leader in the 2012 Republican primary but cited <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/michele-bachmann-releases-physicians-note-on-migraines/2011/07/20/gIQAcnTiQI_story.html\">debilitating migraines</a> to explain why she suddenly left a debate. She eventually released a doctor\u2019s letter explaining the headaches were so strong they required medication. That same year, former Texas governor Rick Perry campaigned despite recent back surgery, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2012/12/03/rick-perrys-back-problems-worse-than-we-knew/\">reportedly using painkillers </a>to cope.</p> <p>Two decades earlier, Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas ran against Bill Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary.

A subsequent presidential election had its own health scare: Republican vice-presidential candidate Dick Cheney <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/15/cheney.hospital/index.html?iref=topnews\">had his fourth heart attack</a> shortly after voters went to the polls in November 2000.</p> <p>Questions of seniority and health followed Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1984 campaign, when the 73-year-old was running for re-election as the oldest president in history. Reagan broached the issue at a debate against his younger opponent, Walter Mondale, joking: \u201cI am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent\u2019s youth and inexperience.\u201d</p> <p>Only eight presidents have died in office, and four of those were assassinated. Not long after his inauguration in 1841, 68-year-old William Henry Harrison caught a cold that developed into pneumonia, according to his doctor, though he may have actually <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/science/what-really-killed-william-henry-harrison.html\">contracted enteric fever</a>. Despite attempts to medicate Harrison with opium and other toxins, he became the first president to die in service.</p> <p>Less than a decade later, Zachary Taylor died in office, only five days after falling ill, probably from cholera. In 1923, Warren G Harding died from heart disease \u2013 a sudden heart attack while he was visiting San Francisco \u2013 aged 57.</p> <p>Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was diagnosed with polio at 39 and lived with increasing paralysis through his time in office, only <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/health/05docs.html\">allowed voters a partial view</a> of his health through four elections and three and a half terms.
