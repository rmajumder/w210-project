  "<p>If you put Brexit to one side, the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/uk-unemployment-claimant-count-falls-after-brexit\">latest unemployment figures </a>are no surprise.</p> <p>They show that Britain\u2019s unemployment rate remained at 4.9% at the end of June, the lowest since 2005, while the number of people claiming jobseeker\u2019s allowance dropped by 8,600 to 763,600 in July, the first fall since February 2016.</p> <p>These headline figures are a continuation of recent trends and reflect a growing economy.</p> <p>However, economists were surprised by the numbers because they had expected a rise in the claimant count on the back of the result of the EU referendum on 23 June.</p> <p>With hindsight, a Brexit-driven shift in the unemployment numbers was unlikely. While companies such as Unilever, JP Morgan and Airbus warned that voting to leave the EU would make doing business in Britain more difficult, they had little incentive to cut jobs immediately after the referendum.</p> <p>As it stands, Britain is still in the EU and we have little idea about what Brexit will look like. The drop in the value of sterling has actually made doing business in Britain more profitable for companies exporting goods and services from the country.</p> <p>The early evidence suggests consumers are <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2016/aug/09/retailers-benefit-as-sunshine-sends-post-brexit-spending-soaring\">more bothered about the warm weather than Brexit</a>, so shops, pubs and other high street businesses do not need to make cutbacks. Retail sales rose by 1.9% year on year in July, the best performance since January according to the British Retail Consortium and KPMG, as shoppers splashed out on summer clothing and barbecue food. </p> <p>The impact of Brexit on the economy will not be known for some time. It will be judged by the size of company cutbacks, but also by planned investments and expansion plans that are scrapped. This is why the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">Bank of England has cut forecasts for 2017 and 2018 rather than this year.</a><br></p> <p>So while the unemployment figures show the economy did not go into shock straight after the vote, Brexiters have little reason to celebrate yet.</p> <h2>Is Deliveroo\u2019s model under threat in courier row?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/deliveroo-announces-it-will-not-force-new-contracts-on-workers\">The protests by Deliveroo workers</a> about their pay highlights that the online revolution is still to solve the biggest conundrum facing shops, restaurants and other consumer-facing businesses \u2013 the last mile.</p> <p>The \u201clast mile\u201d is the phrase used in retail and logistics to describe the process of getting a customer\u2019s order to their front door. </p> <p>For online businesses, the last mile is remarkably inefficient compared with the rest of their operation. Even the zaniest technological advances imaginable do not change the fact that a business must find a way to get its product to the customer.</p> <p>The beauty of a shop or restaurant is that this cost is put on the shopper. In a supermarket, for example, the shopper travels to the store, picks the products off the shelf, then goes home. But online food retailers, such as Ocado, have to bear these costs themselves. </p> <p>This is why a string of online businesses, including the mighty Amazon, have struggled to make a profit despite growing sales rapidly. It is also a good reason why the restaurants for which Deliveroo delivers food were not doing it themselves.</p> <p>Deliveroo has to keep costs under control to make its model work, meaning the amount it pays its couriers is key. The company does not publish its financial results so the health of its balance sheet is not clear. </p> <p>William Shu believed he had identified a gap in the market when he founded Deliveroo in 2013. But a mile is a big gap to fill.</p> <h2>TfL\u2019s English language exam proposal for cabbies tests everyone\u2019s patience</h2> <p><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/17/uber-takes-tfl-to-high-court-over-english-written-test\">Transport for London\u2019s attempts to rein in Uber</a> are becoming ugly. TfL is proposing that drivers applying for a private-hire licence who are from countries where English is not the main language will have to present a certificate showing they have a B1 level of English on the Common European Framework. This certificate requires a two-hour exam that costs \u00a3200 to sit.</p> <p>The new requirements are more stringent than those facing bus drivers, train drivers and other public servants. Uber accepts that drivers should be proficient at spoken English, but believes the proposals go too far and that the company and its drivers are being unfairly targeted \u2013 hence the legal action. </p> <p>TfL says it wants to enhance public safety, but it would be wise to reconsider its position. While public safety and reducing the number of cars on London\u2019s roads are laudable targets, fighting against technological developments and protecting the status quo \u2013 which is what this looks like \u2013 are not.</p> <p>Uber has grown rapidly in London and other cities because its users believe it offers value and convenience compared with the alternatives. The company is not going away. It should be considered as part of a solution for London\u2019s traffic problems, rather than a problem. </p> <p>Rivals who have lost market share because of Uber should focus on improving their service, while TfL should focus on more important things than making taxi drivers write essays.</p>",
  "<p>The British middle-distance runners Laura Muir and Laura Weightman have questioned whether the result of the women\u2019s 1500m final at Rio Olympic Games can be trusted. Their comments came after the race\u2019s silver medallist, the Ethiopian Genzebe Dibaba, said she was \u201ccrystal clean from doping\u201dand defended her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/20/mo-farah-jama-aden-somali-coach-arrest-doping-charges-british-athletics\">controversial coach, Jama Aden</a>, who was arrested in June on charges of administering and distributing doping substances and endangering public health.</p> <p>Aden was released but remains under investigation and cannot leave Spain following a raid on his hotel by police and anti-doping officers that found the banned blood-boosting drug EPO and other prohibited substances.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/bill-furnish-gb-swimming-convicted-drugs-cheats-rio-olympics\">Team GB swimming coach says failure to punish drug cheats adequately cost medals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The athletics world governing body, the IAAF, said its investigation into Aden had begun in 2013 and would \u201cuse all available resources and powers to protect clean athletes and the integrity of our sport\u201d. Aden denies any wrongdoing.</p> <p>After finishing a brave seventh in the 1500m final, Muir was reminded that the equivalent race in London 2012 is now regarded as \u201creally dirty\u201d because six finalists have either failed drug tests or are under investigation.</p> <p>It was then put to her whether the result of her race could be trusted. She hesitated before replying: \u201cI have my doubts, let me say that.\u201d</p> <p>Muir, whose gutsy decision to follow Dibaba and the winner Faith Kipyegon of Kenya when they attacked with two laps to go cost her at the finish, was then asked whether she might be bumped up the standings in the future. \u201cPossibly\u201d was the succinct reply.</p> <p>The 23-year-old\u2019s comments brought to mind those of another British athlete, Lisa Dobriskey, in London four years ago. After finishing 10th in the 1500m she told reporters: \u201cI\u2019ll probably get into trouble for saying this, but I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m competing on a level playing field.\u201d</p> <p>The American Jenny Simpson, who took bronze on Tuesday after running the last 800m of the race in 1min 58sec, said that she was satisfied with her performance because \u201cI\u2019ve done it honestly and clean and with everything that\u2019s just inside my own body being expressed out on the track\u201d.</p> <p>She was then asked directly what she thought about Dibaba. \u201cTo me, personally, it is important who I surround myself with in my life,\u201d she replied. \u201cAnd who I surround myself with are people who are people I\u2019m proud to be affiliated with. Who you are connected to says something.\u201d</p> <p>Beforehand she had been more blunt, telling reporters: \u201cI think you know a tree by the fruit that it bears. And if a tree bears sour fruit, then the fruit around it are likely infected. And so I think that if the World Anti-Doping Agency is on the case, they\u2019ll find what they need to find. I hope so.\u201d</p> <p>When Dibaba was pressed about her relationship with Aden she insisted she had nothing to hide and hit out at those making allegations that she believed had cost her the race. \u201cThe rumours roaming around the world are deeply affecting me,\u201d Dibaba said. \u201cI have communication with Jama. It\u2019s purely and solely, training and execution and competition. And these rumours adversely affected my performance, my psychology.\u201d</p> <p>Dibaba, who said she had been tested \u201cfour, five, six times\u201d in the buildup to Rio, was then asked why she was sticking with a coach under police investigation. \u201cThe evaluation is undergoing,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIf he is clean, I will stay with Jama. If things are worst, I will stop. He is only under custody. I\u2019m completely and crystal clean from doping.\u201d</p> <p>Crystal clean are not words associated with the 1500m final at London 2012. The official Olympics site lists no gold medallist for the race because the victor that day, Turkey\u2019s Asli Cakir Alptekin, is serving an eight-year ban for biological passport anomalies. Her compatriot Gamze Bulut, who is still down as finishing second, has been under investigation by the IAAF since March. From 2011 to 2012 Bulut\u2019s 1,500m personal best dropped from 4:18.23 to 4:01.18 but she has never recaptured that form. The fourth-place finisher, Tatyana Tomashova of Russia, had a 2008 doping suspension and is banned by the IAAF.</p> <p>Weightman, who raced in the 2012 and 2016 Olympic 1500m finals, said she believed there had been \u201chuge steps forward\u201d in the past four years.</p> <p>\u201cThe final in Rio was much better than in London,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I was only 21 and I didn\u2019t really know what was going on. My eyes have been opened a lot more in the last few years but I really believe that I have come a very long way since then. That was a much better final \u2013 I\u2019m delighted for the medallists there: Faith Kipyegon and Jenny Simpson getting a bronze.\u201d</p> <p>When she was told she had not mentioned Dibaba, Weightman pursed her lips and remained silent.</p> <p>The American Shannon Rowbury, who finished sixth in the London 1500m final and missed out on a medal again in Rio after coming fourth, refused to speak to reporters. But when asked before the race whether the 1500m final would be cleaner than London she did not sound sure: \u201cAll I can do is pray and hope for the best.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/marathon-promo-full/\" data-alt=\"RioRun\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/marathon-promo-full/\">RioRun</a> </figure>",
  "<p>The ambulance parked at the back door of pavilion six of the sprawling Olympic complex in Rio de Janeiro is for the boxers. It could, symbolically, be for the sport itself.</p> <p>As reporters tapped away in the nearby media tent on Tuesday evening, still digesting the consequences of the widely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/16/gary-antuanne-russell-boxing-fixing-allegations-rio-olympics\" title=\"\">perceived injustice inflicted on the Irish boxer Michael Conlan</a>, seven microphones pointed along the length of a raised, empty table at one end reserved for press conferences that, to date, have never happened.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/16/michael-conlan-accuses-boxings-ruling-body-after-being-cheated-in-defeat\">Olympic boxing corruption alive and well, says official as rows continue</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While social media hummed from Belfast to Rio about Conlan\u2019s surprising 2-1 defeat to the Russian Vladimir Nikitin in a quarter-final of the bantamweight competition, the sport\u2019s governing body, AIBA, did not feel immediately disposed to offer an explanation of how and why three judges could, in the opinion of partial as well as independent observers, get it so horribly and uniformly wrong.</p> <p>Conlan felt no such reticence. As three scores of 29-28 were announced in Nikitin\u2019s favour, the Irishman, the world champion at his weight and a hero in his own country, stood literally and metaphorically gob-smacked in centre ring. The middle finger of his left hand poked through his sweat-soaked hand wrap, directed vertically in the universal symbol of disgust.</p> <p>Conlan stepped down from his workplace and elaborated on live television at ringside, in language everyone beyond the walls of a monastery could empathise with: \u201cThey\u2019re fucking cheats. They\u2019re known for being cheats. Amateur boxing stinks from the core right to the top.\u201d</p> <p>Has there ever been a more brutal and emotional assessment of a sport? As AIBA staggered towards the ropes under the weight of worldwide opprobrium, Conlan went to the latter-day court of international justice, Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mickconlan11/status/765587723457589248\" title=\"\">to land one more blow</a>:</p> <p>\u201cHey Vlad @PutinRF_Eng How much did they charge you bro?? @AIBA_Boxing #Rio2016\u201d</p> <p>Michael Conlan, all 56 furious kilograms (8st 10lb) of him, was now taking on Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, Mr Macho, a world leader who some interpreters of the whistle-blowing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\" title=\"\">Panama Papers</a> reckon has an offshore wealth of $2bn. In short, a man not to mess with. But Michael was for messing.</p> <p>This was the 21st century equivalent of the famous \u201cwe are watching you\u201d leader in the Skibbereen and West Carbery Eagle that warned Czar Nicholas II in 1898 about his expansionist tendencies. Not a lot has changed in 118 years.</p> <p>Conlan is not afraid to growl at the biggest bear. In London four years ago it took the outstanding Cuban, Robeisy Ram\u00edrez, to stop his progress at flyweight, and he went home with a bronze medal.</p> <p>He is no mere gnat on an elephant\u2019s backside. Conlan is a significant and respected presence in international boxing. The AIBA\u2019s media relations manager, Nicolas Jomard, told the Guardian how surprised was his boss, the perennially absent Wu Ching-kuo, when Conlan\u2019s tirade got back to him.</p> <p>AIBA (and Wu, of course) understood, \u201cMichael\u2019s disappointment\u201d. Jomard continued, adding a vinegar-soaked sponge to the wound: \u201cWe actually do like Michael a lot.\u201d But, he was minded to point out: \u201cWhen a boxer loses, he\u2019s never happy, and he never really blames himself. He always blames the organisation. If he wins, he never complains about the organisation.\u201d</p> <p>There is some truth in that but was there any substance to Conlan\u2019s accusations? That was the bigger question. It was not just about Conlan \u2013 as heartbreaking as losing was for him when he was convinced he had won. It was about the integrity of the sport.</p> <p>And, if amateur boxing did not want a trip to the hospital in that metaphorical ambulance, it needed to provide unequivocal answers to allegations from within the organisation that were every bit as damning as Conlan\u2019s.</p> <p>Jomard, lumbered with the unenviable task of interpreting Wu\u2019s take on this, acknowledged the accusations were \u201cserious\u201d but said: \u201cThe safeguards are in place to ensure there is no direct contact between the relevant stakeholders who make those decisions.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, we are left wondering. While there is no conclusive chain between suspicion and actuality, the circumstantial evidence does not stack up well for the sport. And the history is long and shameful.</p> <p>Richie Woodhall, who lost to Roy Jones Jr in the semi-finals in Seoul in 1988 and is in Rio with the BBC, recalled he and his fellow bronze medallist, Ray Downey, of Canada, watched the final on television in their dressing room. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/feb/15/olympic-moments-roy-jones-jr\" title=\"\">The judges gave the local hero, Park Si-hun, the verdict over Jones</a>. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is still the worst decision in the history of boxing.\u201d</p> <p>The American was, beyond argument, the finest amateur boxer in the world and would go on to replicate his deeds as a professional. Park never had another contest. \u201cBut he\u2019s here now,\u201d Woodhall told me. \u201cI saw him the other day. He\u2019s a coach with the South Korean team.\u201d</p> <p>Woodhall has seen all but 10 of the 240 bouts here. Only two decisions have struck him as \u201cproperly bad\u201d: Conlan\u2019s and the nod given to the Russian heavyweight Evgeny Tishchenko over Vasilly Levit at heavyweight the previous evening.</p> <p>That is a fair assessment. The judging and refereeing generally have been sound. So, was the Conlan decision an aberration, then, or an accident? It is hard to say on the available evidence but something is wrong.</p> <p>AIBA say they have addressed an issue that has been a running sore in the sport for decades. Judges from a large pool are now informed only shortly before a bout who is going to be among the five at ringside. A computer then randomly selects three scores for the final verdict. It seems foolproof but critics allege the system can still be manipulated. They see dark forces at work behind the scenes. The legendary Wu is their natural pi\u00f1ata.</p> <p>He has given interviews but at his time of choosing. That press conference table behind the boxing pavilion remains unused.</p> <p>So, where is he taking the sport? He was instrumental in rushing through a change to the amateur constitution in June that allowed professionals to compete in Rio: all three of them, none of whom got past the second round.</p> <p>If they are to be an enduring presence at the Olympics, the format needs to change. Three rounds are not enough, plainly, to establish inarguable dominance. In nine minutes, Conlan was hurried to the door. Likewise Levit. If the fields were reduced to 16 per weight division, the rounds increased from three to five, the number of bouts reduced with a rest day in between, we may have a workable format. But fewer bouts would mean less exposure and less money.</p> <p>Wu\u2019s vision is for a universal boxing nirvana: one unified sport, amateur and pro, with the four main professional governing bodies drawn under the AIBA umbrella. Already, the WBA have signed up. The WBC, IBF and WBO show no such enthusiasm. Nor do the powerbrokers of the professional boxing business. Self-interest rules.</p> <p>For now, the sport remains in an unedifying limbo, one that has disillusioned Conlan and countless others. He probably will join his brother, Jamie, in the paid ranks. Others will follow, as they always have done. They will leave behind a sport bearing a black eye you could see from Skibbereen.</p>",
  "<p>Fears that a Brexit vote would trigger widespread job losses were not realised last month, with the number of people claiming jobseeker\u2019s allowance unexpectedly falling.

The number of migrant workers from Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia topped 1 million for the first time. A record 1,007,000 migrant workers came from these countries in the second quarter of the year, up 44,000 on the previous quarter.</p> <p>The number of non-UK nationals in employment increased 110,000 to 3.45 million in the second quarter, compared with a rise of just 58,000 in the number of UK nationals in work to 28.2 million. The employment rate, which measures the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were in work, was 74.5%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971.</p> <p>Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotia Bank, said concerns about the Brexit vote were not supported by the data. He said: \u201cAhead of the referendum, speculation was that the economy would grind to a halt, hiring would stall, and investment plans would be put on ice. The first two haven\u2019t happened; we will find out next week whether the third came good. </p> <p>\u201cBut this does provide a glimmer of hope that if fears of the pre-Brexit jitters proved unfounded. Maybe the post-referendum doom and gloom may equally prove to have been overcooked.\u201d</p> <p>But several economists warned that cutbacks over recent months by firms to their investment plans and a freeze on new hiring by many employers were early indicators of a worsening employment picture over the next year, dampening annual pay rises.</p> <p>Scott Bowman, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe vote to leave the EU should cause some firms to put hiring decisions on hold or cut back headcounts altogether, resulting in the unemployment rate drifting up over the coming quarters. This should contain any further rises in earnings growth and keep domestic cost pressures in check.\u201d</p> <p>He said the Bank of England should be able to follow through with more monetary easing to support the economy, without worrying about stoking domestically generated inflation too much.</p> <p>The unemployment announcement comes hot on the heels of Tuesday\u2019s inflation update, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/first-post-brexit-data-shows-uk-inflation-rose-to-06-in-july\">the consumer prices index (CPI) rose to a higher than expected 0.6% in July</a>. CPI was up from 0.5% in June, according to the ONS, with economists expecting the figure to be unchanged. </p> <p>But while there was no sign of the plunge in the value of the pound having an impact on CPI, the ONS said the producer prices index (PPI) showed that sterling\u2019s slump had pushed up the cost of imports for British manufacturers, which could fuel inflation down the line. </p> <p>Input prices rose 4.3% in the year to July, compared with a drop of 0.5% in the year to June, as the PPI was affected by the fall in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote, which drove up the cost of imported metals and chemicals. </p>",

He argued that African Americans had been \u201churt worst\u201d by Clinton\u2019s immigration policy.</p> <p>Trump reiterated claims first made<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/21/donald-trump-republican-national-convention-speech\"> during his acceptance speech at the Republican national convention in July</a>, suggesting that \u201claw and order must be restored\u201d amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/trump-vision-of-violence-city-homicides-obama\">rising homicide rates in America\u2019s largest 50 cities</a>. Despite this recent rise the rate of violent crime <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/dueling-claims-on-crime-trend/\">has in fact declined to historic lows</a> under the Obama administration.</p> <p>The Republican, who had earlier spent time meeting privately with law enforcement leaders in Milwaukee, proposed introducing more police into communities, appointing \u201cthe best\u201d prosecutors and judges and pursuing \u201cstrong enforcement\u201d of federal laws.</p> <p>This combative approach, nakedly opposed to the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement as well as Clinton herself, is perhaps unlikely to draw many more black supporters. The protest movement, which rose to prominence after unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, enjoys 65% support among African Americans, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/08/how-americans-view-the-black-lives-matter-movement/\">according to recent polling</a>; while a survey published in 2015 indicated that Americans\u2019 support for police <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/183704/confidence-police-lowest-years.aspx\">was at a 22-year low</a> and especially weakened among the African American population.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s appeals to African American voters received a lukewarm response inside the Washington County Fair Conference Center on Tuesday evening. Many attendees stayed silent throughout much of speech, with some growing visibly bored. The confederate battle flag, to many a lasting symbol of America\u2019s slave-owning history, was on sale outside of the rally.</p> <p>The Guardian spoke to a dozen rally attendees, all of whom were white, and all of whom lived within a 40-mile radius of the unrest in Milwaukee. Most expressed little if any sympathy for black residents of the city, one of America\u2019s most racially segregated metropolitan areas.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way they (black people) are in that city,\u201d said Ken Schladweiler, a 61-year-old from the small rural town of Neosho. \u201cAll of that (unrest connected to Smith\u2019s death) was just a case so they could riot, loot buildings. They have no jobs. They\u2019re all on welfare. There are murders down there almost every night. That\u2019s just the way they are.\u201d</p> <p>His wife, Nancie, 62, agreed: \u201cAfter all this crap (unrest) happened, I went to work Monday and thought: don\u2019t they (black people) have work? They\u2019re just out there shooting people, blowing up buildings. Don\u2019t they have work?\u201d</p> <p>Julie Wanie, a 50-year-old healthcare professional who works in Milwaukee, said she simply didn\u2019t visit the Sherman Park neighborhood at all.</p> <p>\u201cI know it quite well. I know it enough to stay out of that area. Anybody that lives around here and goes to Milwaukee just knows that\u2019s a certain area you stay out of.\u201d</p> <p>Asked what she thought may have contributed to the rising tensions in the neighbourhood, Wanie replied: \u201cI think Obama has done a lot to incite race wars.\u201d</p> <p>In an earlier interview with Fox News, Trump had indicated he believed the shooting of Smith on Saturday was a justified response by law enforcement despite no body camera footage of the incident being released.</p> <p>\u201c\u2026 The gun was pointed at his (a police officer\u2019s) head, supposedly ready to be fired. Who can have a problem with that? That\u2019s what the narrative is,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not true. If it is true, people shouldn\u2019t be rioting.\u201d</p> <p>While Trump\u2019s hardline law and order stance enjoys support among certain sectors of conservative law enforcement, he has also been criticised by a growing number of progressive reformists.</p> <p>Just hours before Trump\u2019s speech on Tuesday, Ronal Serpas, the former New Orleans police chief and chairman of Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration, issued a pre-emptive statement urging the Republican candidate to drop unfounded claims of a surge in crime.</p> <p>\u201cNow more than ever it\u2019s important to have level-headed conversations about crime and the vital relationship between law enforcement and the communities we serve. Mr Trump\u2019s recent claims that our country is experiencing a crime wave are highly misleading,\u201d Serpas said.</p>"
