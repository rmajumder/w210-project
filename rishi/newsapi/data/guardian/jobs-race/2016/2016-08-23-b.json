  "<p>Five states and a group of Catholic healthcare providers <a href=\"http://www.becketfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Franciscan-Alliance-et-al-v.-Burwell-et-al-Complaint-FINAL.pdf\">launched a federal lawsuit</a> on Tuesday challenging an Obama administration rule banning discrimination against transgender individuals in a healthcare setting. </p> <p>The lawsuit is the latest major addition to a series of challenges conservative states are mounting against the administration as the president attempts to expand transgender rights through executive action. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/23/anti-trans-ruling-law-schools\">What's missing from the anti-trans ruling? Law, facts and compassion | Harper Jean Tobin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Monday, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/22/obama-transgender-students-public-schools-rules-blocked\">federal judge in Texas</a> issued a nationwide injunction against the administration\u2019s requirement for all public schools to give transgender students access to the bathrooms consistent with their gender identity. Barack Obama announced that policy in May and warned that schools failing to comply would risk the loss of millions in federal funds. More than 20 states have since <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/08/states-sue-federal-government-transgender-bathroom-policy\">joined a legal campaign</a> to block the requirement. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-18/pdf/2016-11458.pdf\">rule</a>, which became final on 18 May, prohibits insurance companies and individual healthcare providers from refusing to provide or cover a health service they typically offer on the basis that a patient is trans. It does not require doctors to perform or insurance companies to cover transition-related healthcare services if the service or procedure is not normally offered.</p> <p>Leading Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit are Texas, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Kansas and Kentucky. In their challenge, they <a href=\"http://www.becketfund.org/franciscanalliance/\">argue</a> that the administration\u2019s rule \u201cforces doctors to perform gender transition procedures on children\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOn pain of significant financial liability, the regulation forces doctors to perform controversial and sometimes harmful medical procedures ostensibly designed to permanently change an individual\u2019s sex \u2013 including the sex of children,\u201d the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.becketfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Franciscan-Alliance-et-al-v.-Burwell-et-al-Complaint-FINAL.pdf\">lawsuit</a> claims.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Proponents of the rule called these claims \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cfull of inaccuracies\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re simply trying to invent the worst imaginable scenario in order to scare people,\u201d said Jillian Weiss, the director of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund (TLDEF). </p> <p>In reality, said Weiss, the rule does not require physicians to provide transition-related services that she does not believe are medically necessary. \u201cIt is simply a rule to establish parity,\u201d she said.</p> <p>An insurance company that typically covers mammograms, for example, cannot refuse to cover the test for a patient who has a female anatomy but identifies as a man. Similarly, a family doctor cannot refuse to treat a trans person for the flu because he is opposed to transgender people. Hospitals could be in violation for placing a trans woman with a male roommate if rooms are segregated by gender.</p> <p>\u201cNothing in the regulations mandates that a doctor disregard her medical judgment in treating a trans child or adult,\u201d Ezra Young, a staff attorney with TLDEF, added in a statement. \u201cThe only thing a doctor is obliged to do is treat all patients, including trans patients, with dignity and respect and to make treatment decisions free from bias. If a doctor has a sound, evidence-based, medical reason to delay transition care for a specific patient, that would be respected under the regulations.\u201d<br></p> <p>Weiss also took issue with the plaintiff\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.becketfund.org/doctors-states-challenge-new-transgender-regulation/\">claim</a> that large numbers of children diagnosed with gender dysphoria \u2013 the condition of identifying as a gender other than the one assigned at birth \u2013 \u201cgrow out of their dysphoria naturally\u201d.</p> <p>Amid extensive research, most mainstream medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Non-Conforming-Transgender-Children.aspx\">agree</a> that children who consistently express a transgender identity are transgender all their lives.</p> <p>Surveys of transgender individuals consistently find that large numbers have experienced discrimination at their doctor\u2019s office. A 2011 survey conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force found that one in three transgender people had been harassed by a health care provider, and one in five had been refused healthcare outright. </p> <p>Just under one third of trans people have delayed seeking healthcare because they fear this kind of discrimination. Others have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/03/transgender-healthcare-doctor-oneonta-new-york-carolyn-wolf-gould\">travelled long distances</a> for straightforward services such as mammograms and well-woman appointments. On Tuesday, Weiss said the rules were particularly important to rural patients, whose local doctor might be \u201cthe only doctor for miles\u201d.</p> <p>For the Obama administration, addressing these realities has been a multi-year challenge. The Affordable Care Act contains language that bars any insurer or healthcare provider receiving health department assistance \u2013 such as Medicaid reimbursement \u2013 from discriminating against patients based on their gender identity. Still, reports have abounded of insurers and healthcare refusing service to trans people. Amid these complaints, the health department in September 2015 proposed a new rule stating explicitly that transgender people were protected from bias. The rule was finalized this May.</p> <p>More than a dozen other states have taken similar actions, advising insurance companies that state anti-discrimination laws protect trans people in healthcare settings. California prohibits discrimination by law. </p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit is spearheaded by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a conservative legal action group that successfully argued Hobby Lobby v Burwell before the supreme court. In that case, the group targeted a different Affordable Care Act provision, one which required private sector employers to offer contraceptive coverage in their employees\u2019 healthcare plans. The supreme court ruled 5-4 that some employers could refuse the coverage if it violated their religious beliefs.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cNo doctor should be forced to perform a procedure that he or she believes will harm a child,\u201d Lori Windham, senior counsel for the Becket Fund, said Tuesday. \u201cDecisions on a child\u2019s medical treatment should be between families and their doctors, not dictated by politicians and government bureaucrats.\u201d</p>",

It is new, difficult to pin down, and hard to understand. But it\u2019s important to try to get a handle on who is involved, what they believe, and what their possible influence might be on the immediate future of rightwing politics.</p> <h2>A movement that lives and breathes \u2013 and taunts \u2013 online</h2> <p>The alt- (or alternative) right has surged as a (so far) mainly online movement, occupying positions beyond the pale of many conservatives. It has no centralised organisation or official ideology \u2013 it has been <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/what-exactly-is-the-alternative-right/article/2000310\">described</a> as \u201cscattered and ideologically diffuse\u201d.</p> <p>The alt-right has been involved in fleeting street protests, but its online activities are well-organised and relentless. It recruits by opposing progressive ideas about gender, sexuality, and especially race and immigration. Adherents congregate on message boards like 4chan and 8chan, comment on websites like <a href=\"http://therightstuff.biz/\">the Right Stuff</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amren.com/\">American Renaissance</a>, and lurk on Twitter, where they taunt progressives (or \u201cshitlibs\u201d) and mainstream conservatives (\u201ccuckservatives\u201d).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15dbfa3e43ecf803331e39425ff01d361dec222d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15dbfa3e43ecf803331e39425ff01d361dec222d/0_128_4864_2919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen BannonFILE - In this Jan. 24, 2013 file photo, Executive Producer Stephen Bannon poses at the premiere of \u201cSweetwater\u201d during the 2013 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.

At the height of his Twitter-driven notoriety, Yiannopoulos wrote a <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/03/29/an-establishment-conservatives-guide-to-the-alt-right/\">manifesto</a> introducing the tendency to mainstream conservatives. But are Breitbart and Bannon really a part of the movement? Some of its most hardcore activists say no. </p> <h2>Race realism and ethno-nationalism: what the alt-right believes</h2> <p>Richard Spencer, who coined the term \u201calt-right\u201d in 2008, says he intended the term to describe a diverse, heterodox group whose members were \u201cdeeply alienated, intellectually, even emotionally and spiritually, from American conservatism\u201d. </p> <p>They were disillusioned at the end of the Bush presidency by Republican policies on war and immigration. They sought to draw on currents like the European New Right to transform what they saw as a moribund conservative movement. He and others connected with the succession of websites he edited \u2013 such as Taki magazine and alternativeright.com \u2013 wrote extensively, focusing the alt-right into a more definite ideology, with increasingly hardline ideas about race.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The alt-right has been involved in fleeting street protests, but its online activities are well-organised and relentless</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Spencer says that the term is still flexible, but affiliation has some minimum requirements. \u201cSomeone who is really alt-right recognises the reality of race, and the fact that race matters, and that race is an essential component of identity.\u201d</p> <p>Shane Burley, a journalist and researcher who has covered the far right extensively, says that Spencer\u2019s orientation \u201cis clearly under the umbrella of what we would call fascism\u201d. Spencer\u2019s so-called \u201crace realism\u201d underpins theories of racial hierarchy, and the idea that it has a basis in biology. Related ideas of \u201chuman biodiversity\u201d attempt to buttress the notion that race is destiny, and the primary organising category of society and history. <a href=\"http://www.radixjournal.com/\">Radix</a> is full of articles that link race with IQ or crime. This revival of previously discredited scientific racism is another recurring feature of alt-right thought.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a4364882f7174ff22edb6f0490cafee43d17504\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a4364882f7174ff22edb6f0490cafee43d17504/0_157_4186_2513/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milo Yiannopoulos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milo Yiannopoulos popularised the term \u2018alt-right\u2019 in a manifesto published on Breitbart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Burley says that the very fact that these ideas were once so thoroughly discredited opens up a gap for them to be promulgated again. \u201cRight now the arguments against their race and IQ position are less well-known, so they have the ability to plant the seed in the public imagination. </p> <p>\u201cAlmost all of the studies that they cite are marginal, construct-sweeping theories on the basis of very little data, and don\u2019t demonstrate the causal links that they claim for them.\u201d</p> <p>Other adherents emphasise their desire for racial separatism. Mike Enoch, from the site the Right Stuff, a major hub for the dissemination of alt-right materials, says: \u201cThe core principle, in my view, is ethno-nationalism, meaning that nations should be as ethnically and racially homogeneous as possible.\u201d</p> <p>As for Breitbart, Enoch thinks that it \u201cis the closest thing to sympathetic to our position that is out there in the mainstream, and there may be some people that share our views that work there, but the official editorial line of Breitbart is not alt-right\u201d.</p> <p>Chip Berlet, a veteran researcher of the far right and the coauthor of Right-Wing Populism in America, says that the idea of ethno-nationalism is derived from the European New Right. It\u2019s the claim that \u201cevery ethno-religious nationalist group has the right to its own homeland\u201d. </p> <p>This willingness to make open racial appeals is reflected in another fundamental claim on the alt-right that, as Spencer puts it, is the preponderance of \u201cJewish power and Jewish influence\u201d. This antisemitism dovetails with other kinds of conspiracy thinking \u2013 in the last week, alt-right Twitter accounts have been pushing the claim that Hillary Clinton is hiding <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HillarysLeaks?src=hash]\">serious health problems</a>.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Conspiracy theories make them into heroes who have exposed a plot.</p> <footer> <cite>Chip Berlet</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Berlet says antisemitism has \u201calways been a dividing line on the US right\u201d, separating the fringes from more mainstream groups, and \u201crightwing movements in the US have been obsessed with conspiracies since the Salem witch-hunts and the anti-Masonic scares. Nativist movements have always embraced the motif of subversion. It\u2019s normal for them: it makes them into heroes who have exposed a plot.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2018A sense that white identity is under attack\u2019</h2> <p>Perhaps the most potent element of alt-right activism is the effort to build a sense of a specific white identity, and to claim that this identity is under attack. </p> <p>\u201cAnti-white animus in society at large is palpable,\u201d says Spencer. Demands for diversity in the workplace mean \u201cless white males in particular\u201d. More openly extreme alt-right accounts on Twitter talk about immigration in terms of \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WhiteGenocide?src=hash\">white genocide</a>\u201d.</p> <p>This sense of injured white identity is what defines the alt-right, according to Dan Cassino, a Fairleigh Dickinson University political scientist and the author of a new book on Fox News and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fox-News-American-Politics-Psychology/dp/1138900125/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\">American politics</a>. \u201cThe founding myth of the alt-right is that the disadvantaged groups in American politics are actually running things through a combination of fraud and intimidation. By doing this, they\u2019re actually oppressing white men.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201coriginal sin\u201d of current American politics, according to Cassino, is that neither liberals nor conservatives have a very good answer to the question of what is to be done about \u201cthe people who get screwed over\u201d by economic policies. <br></p> <p>If these sentiments are growing, it may mean a larger and more receptive audience for the more radical message of the alt-right. Adherents claim that the movement is expanding. </p> <p>Spencer does not have solid figures, but claims to have seen many new faces at his events, including young people who have been \u201credpilled\u201d \u2013 or racially \u201cawoken\u201d \u2013 in the last year. Enoch claims that the Right Stuff\u2019s suite of podcasts gets more than 100,000 listeners a week. </p> <p>It may be that a growing audience for these ideas is pulling Breitbart in a more hardline direction. Spencer calls Breitbart \u201calt-right lite\u201d, and says that its fundamental populism has led them to tentatively begin to express ideas similar to his. </p> <p>Berlet says just because Bannon is not a card-carrying member of the alt-right does not mean that progressives should be relaxed about Trump\u2019s erratic and intermittently fascist-sounding campaign. </p> <p>Berlet does not think that American politics has been in such a dangerous place vis-a-vis the far right for almost a century. For him, the parallels between the Trump campaign and the alt-right are \u201cthe most important pushback against having a multicultural and pluralistic society since the 1920s Klan\u201d.<br></p> <p><br><br></p>",
  "<p></p> <p>People from sub-Saharan Africa, particularly South Sudan, have reported facing a high level of discrimination in Australia, especially during contact with police.</p> <p>The finding comes from the ninth <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/24/australia-broadly-tolerant-but-pockets-of-intense-prejudice-remain-report-shows\">Australia Today report by the Scanlon Foundation</a>, which examines public opinion on social cohesion, trust, immigration, asylum seekers and ethnic, cultural and religious diversity.</p> <p> </p> <p>It found more respondents from African groups than other group indicated experiencing discrimination \u2013 77% of those born in South Sudan, 75% from Zimbabwe, 67% from Kenya, 60% from Ethiopia, 53% from Egypt.</p> <p> The report found: \u201cA relatively high proportion of South Sudanese, 59%, indicated that they had experienced discrimination when in contact with police over the last 12 months, 26% indicated that their property had been damaged, and 17% that they had been subject to physical attack.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThese findings are consistent with a number of issues raised in focus group discussion.\u201d</p> <p>About 10,000 people were surveyed and the foundation held 51 focus group discussions involving 285 participants in Victoria.</p> <p>Bright Chinganya is the director of Carers of Africa, a non-profit organisation in Victoria which works to improve access to health and community services for refugees. He said he was not surprised by the findings of the Scanlon report.</p> <p>He said he recently had a group of teenagers come into his office saying they had been called a \u201cpack of ethnics\u201d while walking down the street.</p> <p>\u201cI know a few boys who get asked by police to show their tickets every time they are at the train station, and some report having their cars stopped by police frequently and being asked to show them their licence,\u201d Chinganya said.</p> <p>\u201cJust in the past two weeks I had parents come into my office because their kids in year 11 and 12 were picked up by police and accused of stealing from a shop, because CCTV footage apparently just showed them near the area. According to them, they were not responsible.\u201d</p> <p>Children commonly reported being bullied because of their ethnicity at school, he said.</p> <p>But Chinganya said he also believed some people from African backgrounds had a \u201cdefensive mechanism\u201d and sometimes wrongly believed they were being targeted. </p> <p>\u201cI think we need a lot of education to educate the Africans and non-Africans that this is not a place to discriminate against one another,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we need community engagement programs where groups can meet and have a fun night and games.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also good for African organisations and community leaders to invite non-Africans to their functions so they can come together to make these barriers fall down.\u201d</p> <p>Kot Monoah, chairman of the South Sudanese Community Association, told Guardian Australia that recent media reports about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/14/melbourne-street-brawl-blamed-on-apex-gang-after-moomba-festival\">Apex gang</a> \u2013 comprising young men in Melbourne\u2019s south-east from a range of backgrounds, including Sudanese, Pacific Islander, M\u0101ori and Caucasian \u2013 had not helped public and police perceptions of African people.

He said police attended a community seminar with the association on Saturday. However, some people at that forum said they had been discriminated against by police, he said.</p> <p>\u201cFor example, being targeted and over-policed in public areas like at bus stops and train stations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an awful feeling for any person in Australian society to go through that.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t people within the police engaging with the community really well, but that respectful engagement tends to occur at the top end of the leadership hierarchy and the lower end of the hierarchy don\u2019t get it right a lot of the time.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I first came across the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/weekly\" title=\"\">Guardian Weekly</a> as an Australian Volunteer Abroad in Nicaragua in 1989.

Then came a homemade knife and fork Tubman used to eat her meals. Finally, Blockson removed two items that caused a lump to form in Bunch\u2019s throat and left tears in his eyes.

But those items represent 10 years of work by museum curators scouring the US, searching attics, basements and boxes, receiving some donations from people like Blockson, while reassuring countless others that the items they have stored in closets for years will be preserved by the Smithsonian and, eventually, become parts of a public story about the history of black America.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to talk about how our closet is a different type of closet, and what it means moving something from a family\u2019s legacy to a nation\u2019s legacy,\u201d says Mich\u00e8le Gates Moresi, curator of collections at the NMAAHC. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/13/new-smithsonian-museum-african-american-history-tour\">Inside the new Smithsonian: a vivid exploration of African American history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bunch was no novice to the worlds of scholarship and museum administration when he became founding director of the NMAAHC in 2004. He had been president of the Chicago Historical Society, and before then he had already spent a decade as a curator and administrator in the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History. When Bunch started, he had three staffers, including himself and Moresi, who came on as a junior curator in 2006. He had to raise $250m on his own, a sum that would be matched by congressional appropriations. There were no benefactors, no collections and no funds to buy anything. And he was now tasked with finding the artifacts to fill 380,000 square feet of space.</p> <p>A growing museum staff of curators began contacting collectors, confident that some of them would have items that were a fit for the new museum. Other collectors reached out to museum staff themselves, which is how the NMAAHC ended up with its black fashion collection. The clothing was donated by Joyce A Bailey, whose mother, Lois Alexander-Lane, had founded the Black Fashion Museum in New York City.</p> <p>\u201cThe best place for the collection was the new museum,\u201d Bailey says. \u201cIt needed to be some place where it would be cared for properly and where other people would be able to come and see portions of the collection and realize the centuries of contributions made by the women and men of the African diaspora.\u201d</p> <p>Among the items donated from Bailey was the dress Rosa Parks was making when she was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on the bus. Getting items like this made the overall task of filling out future museum exhibits easier. But Bunch knew that more of the artifacts for the NMAAHC would come from people who weren\u2019t diehard collectors. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3eb72d09e0f5d422b59f6ba9cc2e7b2be2d4ba16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3eb72d09e0f5d422b59f6ba9cc2e7b2be2d4ba16/0_377_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rosa Parks riding on the Montgomery Area Transit System bus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rosa Parks riding on the Montgomery Area Transit System bus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEarly in my career I remember doing collecting and people saying I don\u2019t have anything,\u201d Bunch says. \u201cThen you look in the trunk and there\u2019s great stuff. Our belief was there were a lot of people who were waiting to open those trunks.\u201d</p> <p>So the museum put out a nationwide call in 2008 to let people know they were looking for contributions. Bunch and his curators hit the road, holding a series of \u201ctreasures\u201d events in New York, Chicago, Detroit and about 10 other cities. Sometimes people came with donations, but it was more often the case that the connections made at an event would turn into a donation opportunity later on, and a chance for NMAAHC staff to explain what the Smithsonian could provide when it came to protecting items that, in some cases, weren\u2019t only pieces of a collective black history, but also important articles of individual families\u2019 histories.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but my mom was a pioneer,\u201d says Donna Limerick, who had met Moresi and gotten her contact information at one of the early treasures events.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/20/harriet-tubman-20-dollar-bill-racism-andrew-jackson\">Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill papers over racism | Ijeoma Oluo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Limerick\u2019s mother is 103-year-old Mae Reeves, a longtime Philadelphia milliner who owned two ladies\u2019 hat shops.

What she\u2019s given to the museum is a lost art form.\u201d</p> <p>Museum curators found artifacts in other ways as well.</p> <p>As a college student, Joan Mulholland had attended sit-ins and Freedom Rides organized by fellow undergraduates during the civil rights movement. She was 22 when she and several friends drove to Birmingham, Alabama, in September 1963, just days after the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist church that killed four young black girls. On the ground were shards from the church\u2019s glass windows that had been blasted apart by the explosion. Mulholland picked up as many as she could carry, and kept them in a box of her own artifacts from the civil rights movement. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"887fd170becb833efb640b64fda55b3455054a83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/887fd170becb833efb640b64fda55b3455054a83/0_28_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shards of glass from the 16th street Baptist Church bombing will be included in the collection\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shards of glass from the 16th street Baptist church bombing will be included in the collection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then, six years ago at the 50th anniversary conference commemorating the founding of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, she met a pair of curators from the new Smithsonian museum. Mulholland invited them to her house in Virginia to not only see the glass shards, but also the other relics from the civil rights era she had kept, such as notices of student protest rallies and posters the Ku Klux Klan had posted around her college town of Tupelo, Mississippi. Then she donated virtually all of her items to the new museum.</p> <p>\u201cI still have some shards,\u201d says Mulholland, who will be 75 when the NMAAHC opens. \u201cBut I wanted to make sure the civil rights things were in a place where they were preserved. Most of my archival stuff went to the museum.\u201d</p> <p>For collectors like Blockson, donating items seemed to be a higher calling. His personal history is interwoven with Tubman\u2019s.

I knew the perfect place would be the new national African American museum.\u201d</p> <p>Bunch and his curators have collected roughly 37,000 artifacts since they began canvassing the US in 2008; more than 20,000 are photographs.

  "<p>Twenty-five years ago, when I started out as an English teacher, I was pretty much always spot on estimating my students\u2019 exam results. I had no experience but I had good colleagues and some tatty past papers. All I had to do was check what the kids could do unaided, remedy any mistakes they were making and guide them through. I was working in a big urban comprehensive. There wasn\u2019t much homework going on and I\u2019d been in the middle of more than one lesson when the police had arrived to have a chat with someone. The kids were always there for their exams though. And they got what I expected.</p> <p>Now I\u2019m a headteacher. And this year I have absolutely no idea what my students will get in their GCSEs \u2013 neither as a teacher of a GCSE class nor the head of 180 children in that year. We have done four sets of mocks, compulsory after-school revision sessions, Easter school, Saturday school, parents\u2019 revision evenings, and afternoons and mornings. There simply is nothing more my staff could have done \u2013 they have put on brilliant lessons, great teaching, lots of feedback, precision analysis.</p> <p>But we still haven\u2019t got a clue because of changes to grade boundaries made at whim, structural changes to questions and papers, and some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/17/gcse-exam-pupils-baffled-by-business-studies-question-in-biology-paper\">frankly ridiculous questions this year</a> \u2013 which initiated a ton of amusing memes. Then there are serious concerns about the quality of markers, many of whom are inexperienced or overworked, or both. I had a recent case in which a former member of staff with a grudge was appointed as a moderator to my school. Is it any surprise if headteachers are terrified?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/23/progress-8-gcse-results-pupils-results-schools\">Progress 8 and GCSEs: will the new way to judge schools be fairer?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last year we were side-swiped by IGCSE English marking that essentially contradicted everything we\u2019d been told. The GCSE maths C/D boundary was moved by eight marks. It was so obvious (but as an examiner you can\u2019t go on the record) that even <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-36046505\">independent schools spoke out.</a></p> <p>One of my good friends was sacked from his position of headteacher in a large academy chain after only two years. His results were better than mine and the gap between his estimates and the reality was smaller \u2013 but the gap suggested to his academy chain bosses that he didn\u2019t know what he was doing. He has three children, is brilliant, and hasn\u2019t secured a permanent job since.</p> <p>I\u2019m lucky \u2013 I have very supportive bosses, they understand the context of disadvantage in our school and they appreciate that building real change takes time and patience. But with a bad set of results, I will come under the watchful eye of our regional schools commissioner, local authority, the Department for Education and Ofsted. Successive poor results would rock my self-confidence \u2013 I worry most about losing the trust of my bosses, my senior team and the teachers who bust a gut every day.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Headteachers face uncertainty about exams, budgets cuts, redundancies, recruitment \u2013 on top of the basic day job</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I don\u2019t know what results we\u2019re going to get but I know we won\u2019t be near the top of the league tables. Our children start year 7 well below expected standards (I expect they started primary school well below expected standards too) and things just get tougher for them. More than 40% of them are on our special needs register, 60% receive free school meals, 20% live in a home where none of the adults has ever worked and 12% have an attendance to school of 25% or less. If I use <a href=\"http://www.fft.org.uk/\">Fisher Family Trust</a> data, the most commonly used tool for predicting likely outcomes based on starting points, it says this cohort of year 11 will get 26%-32% A*-C including English and maths. Our aspirations for them are much higher than this. Naturally, I\u2019m hoping to hit the floor target (40%).</p> <p>But I have little faith in the system now. I\u2019ve been suffering from anxiety since October. I\u2019ve been lying awake in the small hours trying to figure out what else we could do. When I wake up it is often the first thing I think about. My stress-related psoriasis and irritable bowel syndrome have never been worse and I\u2019ve had more migraines in the past 12 months than in the past 10 years.</p> <p>My blood pressure shot up so high just before Christmas that it wasn\u2019t on any of the charts, and I thought the doctor was going to handcuff me to his chair to stop me going into work. And that\u2019s just the physical effects; it does not include the damage to my marriage, and the relationship I have with my children or other friends and family. My mum asked me if I just couldn\u2019t get a job at one of those \u201cnormal quiet schools\u201d. I\u2019m not sure they exist any more.</p> <p>When I meet up with local colleagues, some of them are looking pretty awful and are full of tales of woe. My Twitter colleagues who are heads are dropping off my timeline. Not only are we all facing uncertainty about exams, we\u2019re juggling this with reduced budgets, redundancies, trying to recruit when there are genuine problems out there \u2013 compounded in some geographical areas \u2013 and that\u2019s on top of the basic day job.</p> <p>We need to get back to a time when if a student demonstrated they knew specific content or showed specific skills, they were rewarded for it. It should not matter where they stand in a rank order. We need to stop changing marking guidance mid-year and provide decent exemplar work for schools to refer to.</p> <p>The move towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/23/progress-8-gcse-results-pupils-results-schools\">Progress 8</a>, the new accountability measure intended to judge schools on progress made by students, is a positive move forward. But I know that the press will still be reporting five A*-Cs including English and maths, and the first unvalidated league tables will use this measure. I know what the banners outside schools and on websites will be. Even if we have a brilliant year, we won\u2019t compare well \u2013 and this is the only information parents will refer to when choosing their September 2017 schools.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/17/gcse-exam-pupils-baffled-by-business-studies-question-in-biology-paper\">GCSE exam pupils baffled by 'business studies' question in biology paper</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We need to stop pretending every child is the same whatever their background and that we can achieve the same outcomes at the same time. Just like drivers, sometimes kids need more than one go at a test. I did not achieve my grade C in maths at 16 and I certainly don\u2019t have an Ebacc. I also didn\u2019t take eight level 2 qualifications at 16 either, so I personally wouldn\u2019t show in the Progress 8 measures. Some children will never attain grade Cs in maths and English, no matter how many times they try. This should not make them or their schools failures.</p> <p>There has been an unprecedented clampdown on \u201cgaming\u201d \u2013 when schools did everything they could to improve headline figures. But I\u2019d say this went too far. Some of the alternative qualifications were genuinely better for some kids and it\u2019s not fair on others not to allow retakes. Coursework was a good preparation for university, too. These were sacrificed for the sake of the headline A*-C scores and in schools like mine that is bad for the students. There is an obsession by already-advantaged parents with the league tables and with the schools at the top of them. Comprehensive education is becoming far less comprehensive in some areas of the country.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t really matter that I\u2019d like a fairer system for the children and also for the teachers. When midnight on Wednesday ticks around, I\u2019ll be doing the middle of the night download and figuring out whether I will still have a job.</p>",
  "<h2>Learning to relax is the best body language tip</h2> <p>Psychologist Dr Gary Wood recommends forgetting about body language techniques during a job interview. \u201cBody language takes care of itself when we are relaxed,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But making yourself relaxed isn\u2019t easy. \u201cMost people can overcome interview nerves by adopting some simple breathing and mindfulness techniques before and during the interview,\u201d adds Lisa LaRue, career coach at <a href=\"http://www.careerworx.co.uk/\">CareerWorx</a>. One tip is to go into a quiet room and practice slow, deep breathing before you go in. When we are anxious, blood flows away from our brains, so this technique will bring the oxygen back to your head and help you to think clearly.</p> <h2>Pinpoint your strengths and weaknesses</h2> <p>Before you have the interview, you need to be self-aware about your skills and weaknesses, says Claire Jenkins, founder of <a href=\"http://www.121interviewcoaching.co.uk/\">121 Interview Coaching</a>. \u201cReally step inside the job description and the key words and phrases it contains to work out where you have more or less what they might want,\u201d she says. It\u2019s then a case of using this knowledge to convince your audience that you are the best candidate for the job.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/jul/10/the-ultimate-guide-to-nailing-any-job-interview-live-chat\">The ultimate guide to nailing any job interview \u2013 live chat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sarah Archer, co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.careertree.org.uk/\">CareerTree</a>, agrees that you need to think about what makes you stand out against other candidates. \u201cThink about your unique selling points in relation to the role you are being interviewed for and communicate them clearly to the interview panel.\u201d</p> <p>Archer adds that knowing your weaknesses is also a strength. \u201cWhen you get asked about your weaknesses, employers are really testing your self awareness,\u201d she says. \u201cThey want to hear what you think your development needs are. My best advice to clients for this is whatever weakness you choose to share, have a strategy to manage it.\u201d </p> <p>So if you say, \u201cI sometimes take on too much\u201d, as a weakness then follow it up with an explanation of the way you manage that weakness. For example: \u201cNow I have a detailed work plan so I can see how much spare capacity I have to take on extra work, and I\u2019ve undertaken assertiveness training.\u201d</p> <h2>Do a mock interview beforehand</h2> <p>It\u2019s well-known that preparation is key for pulling off a strong interview, but Katherine Burik, founder of <a href=\"http://www.jobinterviewcoaching.org/\">The Interview Doctor</a>, recommends preparing your responses in writing in advance. \u201cEdit and then practice saying your stories out loud until the responses sound succinct and support your claims. Know by heart the stories you want to tell that demonstrate your accomplishments.\u201d</p> <p>Interview specialist Jon Gregory adds that running mock interviews with a willing friend or family member can also help you hone your technique. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve prepared your answers to common questions, rehearse them thoroughly. This will greatly help with nerves also, if you suffer from them.\u201d</p> <h2>Don\u2019t give generic answers</h2> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>The more specific and tangible examples you can provide that demonstrate that you have the experience needed, the better,\u201d explains <a href=\"http://www.interview-coach.co.uk/\">interview coach</a> Margaret Buj. \u201cIn my experience most people unfortunately give very generic answers that don\u2019t make them stand out from others.\u201d A good way to stop yourself sounding generic is to provide as many specific examples as you can of how you\u2019ve added value, of course making sure they\u2019re relevant to the skills the interviewers are looking for.</p> <p>Victoria McLean,<strong> </strong>founder of <a href=\"http://www.citycv.co.uk/\">CityCV.co.uk</a>, agrees that a common mistake is to give basic answers. \u201cThe internet is a great empowerer, but it also means that we all have access to pretty much the same information.\u201d The way to get ahead of the competition is to apply the knowledge you\u2019ve learned to the wider industry you\u2019re hoping to work in. \u201cAnyone can learn facts about a company but not everyone can give the facts some context by showing an opinion or argument that draws upon the information they\u2019ve learned,\u201d explains McLean.</p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?
