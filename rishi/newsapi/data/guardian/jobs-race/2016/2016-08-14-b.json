  "<p>Nadiya Hussain confirmed her status as the poster girl for integrated Britain when, cast away on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/14/bake-off-winner-nadiya-hussain-racist-abuse-is-part-of-her-everyday-life\" title=\"\">the latest Desert Island Discs</a>, the Bake Off star chose Marmite as her luxury. Having picked the nation\u2019s most identifiable spread, she did not really need to say, as in a characteristically articulate moment she did, that of all the many things that define her, her Britishness comes first. But it made it all the more jarring when she also spoke of the racial abuse, both verbal and physical, that once kept her indoors with her small children and which even now she takes as something to be expected, despite teetering close to being a very young national treasure.</p> <p>She was not asked \u2013 Desert Island Discs is not that kind of programme \u2013 if the abuse is worse now. The Metropolitan police reckon it is up by 60% between last year and this, after Brexit and with the elision between the government\u2019s Prevent strategy of counter-extremism and measures to promote integration, along with plans to legislate against vaguely defined \u201cextremism\u201d. But everything she said was a reminder that although radicalisation is a real and difficult issue, treating Muslims as the problem instead of acknowledging that social injustice plays a large part&#xa0;in excluding a significant minority from the aspirations and experiences of the majority only undermines the trust on which security depends.</p> <p>A report from MPs on <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmwomeq/89/8905.htm\" title=\"\">the Commons women and equalities committee</a> published last week provided chapter and verse on the kind of discrimination that Muslim women \u2013 and men \u2013 experience in the jobs market. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/uk-confusion-integration-counter-terrorism-hinders-muslims\" title=\"\">Unemployment among economically active Muslims</a> is over 12%, when for the general population it is only 5.4%; four out of 10 Muslims are not even looking for work \u2013 double the national rate \u2013 and for Muslim women it is close to two thirds. This policy failure is partly obscured by the lack of evidence. Not enough data is collected to understand the diversity of the Muslim population, where the tradition has been to assume that all British Muslims have family ties with Bangladesh or Pakistan (in fact, it is only 53%), nor for the diversity of experience to be clear. If it is not known whether it is family pressure or inadequate support at jobcentres that stops women going out to work, or why girls at some schools or from some ethnicities do not go on to higher education while others are going on in greater numbers than boys, then it is hard to devise policy, and harder still to monitor its effectiveness. A report in June from <a href=\"http://runnymedetrust.org/projects-and-publications/europe/cerd.html\" title=\"\">the Runnymede Trust</a> was even more critical of the government\u2019s approach. It drew attention not only to the lack of reliable evidence, but questioned the failure to consider the wider impact of discrimination in policing and the&#xa0;criminal justice system.</p> <p>The most troubling aspect of the committee\u2019s report was the evidence it heard from Muslim organisations about the effect of counter-terror and anti-extremism strategies. Even though five years ago, in the early years of the coalition, the importance of the distinction between measures to help social and economic integration and measures to reduce the risk of radicalisation were stressed, senior figures in the government repeatedly equated them. In January this year, when David Cameron announced extra funding for Esol \u2013 English for speakers of other languages \u2013 he allied it with the campaign to deter a \u201cslide towards radicalism and extremism\u201d. In evidence given to the committee, the skills minister Nick Boles confirmed that the policy was not so much intended to help Muslim women to get on, as&#xa0;to stop them being radicalised.</p> <p>Five years ago, urged on by Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, who warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jan/20/lady-warsi-islamophobia-muslims-prejudice\" title=\"\">Islamophobia was becoming socially acceptable</a>, a working group was set up to find out what was happening. Last October, Matthew Goodwin, one of two academics brought in as advisers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/19/islamophobia-government-engagement-muslims-anti-hatred-taskforce\" title=\"\">resigned in frustration</a> at the failure of the government to provide adequate financial or ministerial backing. That lack of drive and direction behind any of the respectable-sounding strategies the government has introduced over the past six years was a recurring theme of witnesses to the equalities committee. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/sep/21/gender.usa\" title=\"\">a long, inglorious tradition</a> of the British establishment claiming to take up the cause of Muslim women in order to conceal some other objective. Nadiya Hussain cannot rebuild trust between the establishment and the Muslim community on her own. The government must show that it recognises the problem is one of social justice \u2013 and tackle it with the energy Theresa May promised on the steps of Downing Street barely a month ago.</p>",
  "<p>Braving the heatwave sweeping the eastern US, thousands of workers marched in Richmond on Saturday chanting: \u201cIf you want our vote, come get our vote!\u201d</p> <p>That was the overarching message of the first national Fight for $15 convention, which was held just weeks after both Democrats and Republicans held their conventions to nominate their candidates for the next US president.</p> <p>At the convention, the attending low-wage workers unanimously decided to push political candidates to commit to raising US wages, agreed to hold a national day of action on 12 September, and resolved to demonstrate at all presidential and vice-presidential debates.</p> <p>Additionally, the workers said they would support ballot initiatives to raise minimum wage in cities and states. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MaryKayHenry/status/764524396795031552\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FightFor15?src=hash\">#FightFor15</a> workers chanting &quot;If you want our vote, come get our vote!&quot; <a href=\"https://t.co/teAbIaZUwy\">pic.twitter.com/teAbIaZUwy</a></p>&mdash; Mary Kay Henry (@MaryKayHenry) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaryKayHenry/status/764524396795031552\">August 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The convention in Richmond \u2013 the former capital of the Confederacy \u2013 was organized to draw focus to the links between economic and racial justice.

On Friday, its president, Mary Kay Henry, called for both white and black working class Americans to unite and fight for an economy that benefits everyone.</p> <p>\u201cBuilding this unity is especially important this year, with this election. We all know that one of the candidates for president is trying to divide us in dangerous and sometimes frightening ways,\u201d Henry said, avoiding the name of Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has variously advocated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/08/federal-minimum-wage-trump\">an end to the federal minimum wage</a>, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-gets-full-flop-stance-minimum-wage/\">increased wages and positions in between</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/fight-15-organizers-demand-employee-status-seiu\">Fight for $15 organizers demand employee status from SEIU</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet like the Democratic and Republican pageants, the workers\u2019 convention saw dissent and interruptions.

  "<p>When Kate Mara was 19 she skipped college \u2013 a place at the highly respected <a href=\"http://tisch.nyu.edu/\">Tisch School of Performing Arts</a> at New York University \u2013 and bought a dog, Bruno, a Boston Terrier with one blue eye. \u201cI knew I would need the company,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause where I was going, I knew literally no one.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than remain at home with her big Irish family in New York, she was headed to Los Angeles to be a star. Fourteen years later, we\u2019re at the Broome Street General Store, a small coffee shop in Silverlake, to talk about her latest movie. But Mara\u2019s is not a sentimental story \u2013 it\u2019s about ambition. She was a painfully shy girl who loathed school and couldn\u2019t bear the thought of college. \u201cI look back and think, wow, that\u2019s how ambitious I was,\u201d she says. \u201cI was prepared to go through all that. But I\u2019m glad I did. It was worth it.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Mara and her arguably better-known actor sister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/rooney-mara\">Rooney</a> are arm in arm on red carpets, A-listers both. But it was Kate, 33, the elder by two years, who first made the leap. Today, wearing a red sundress, she directs me to a shaded table outside. \u201cI\u2019m Irish,\u201d she says. \u201cI burn.\u201d She doesn\u2019t seem the carefree, sundress type \u2013 there\u2019s a steeliness to her; precise and clear, with an almost clinical intelligence behind the eyes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWlJqsF_WVw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rWlJqsF_WVw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Ice queen: Kate Mara in her latest film, Morgan.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>As Zoe Barnes in <em>House of Cards</em>, she shone as the ruthlessly ambitious political reporter who stops at nothing until Kevin Spacey shoves her in front of a train. This part has made her a global name. \u201cI was just in London,\u201d she explains, \u201cand every time I took the tube, people would stare.\u201d In last year\u2019s Oscar contender <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/04/the-martian-review-matt-damon-shines-stranded-astronaut\"><em>The Martian</em></a>, she was a computer expert in a crew of astronauts, a nerd among nerds. In <em>Morgan</em>, her latest project, she is excellently cast as Lee Weathers, an icy executive \u201cfrom corporate\u201d who has been sent to shut down an AI research project that has gone awry. The android (Morgan) has turned violent, and while the scientists who raised \u201cher\u201d (Toby Jones and Rose Leslie) insist that she ought to be given another chance, their heartfelt appeals bounce uselessly off Mara\u2019s pinstriped trouser suit and heels. She\u2019s so tough that, though it seems improbable at first, the petite Mara spends the last third of the movie in a series of brutal fight scenes, getting hurled through windows and suchlike.</p> <p>\u201cI got a lot of bruises,\u201d she grins. \u201cBut it was fun. I think when you have a tense movie like this, and you spend all day in a dark house in life-and-death scenarios, you become delirious. We\u2019d be crying with laughter at the most stupid things.\u201d</p> <p>In person, Mara is a good deal warmer than Weathers. When she learns that I, too, have a Boston Terrier, she coos over photos of the dog on my phone. She\u2019s not a reclusive celebrity. They know her here at the general store; regulars come up to say hello, and she\u2019s often seen walking her dogs with her boyfriend, the British actor Jamie Bell. \u201cIt\u2019s really therapeutic,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"576f59ee2859c588672a6921de94cf403795f8ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/576f59ee2859c588672a6921de94cf403795f8ed/0_86_1392_835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young at heart: in Brokeback Mountain (2005).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young at heart: in Brokeback Mountain (2005).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Focus/Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn\u2019t fame that propelled Mara, unlike Bell, to a life of privilege \u2013 she was born that way. Her father and his siblings own the New York Giants (estimated worth $2.1bn), and her mother\u2019s side of the family owns the Pittsburgh Steelers (estimated worth $1bn). With sister Rooney she is one of four siblings who enjoyed an idyllic upbringing of football and church and huge family gatherings \u2013 her father is one of 11, and there are 22 aunts and uncles in all. She tells me they grew up about an hour north of New York city, in a suburb called Bedford \u2013 not to be confused with Bedford-Stuyvesant, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jun/18/michael-lavines-best-photograph-biggie-smalls-notorious-big\">Biggie Smalls</a> grew up. \u201cHaha! No, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/martha-stewart\">Martha Stewart </a>lives in Bedford. It\u2019s a bit different,\u201d she says. \u201cMind you, she went to prison too\u2026\u201d Her greatest challenge growing up was remembering the name of the new baby at Thanksgiving. \u201cThere\u2019s always a new baby in our family.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you have a tense movie like Morgan, you become delirious, crying with laughter at stupid things</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When they were young, their mother would regularly take her two daughters to Broadway shows and the movies. At nine years old, Mara decided she would act. \u201cRooney was different,\u201d she explains. \u201cShe explored other interests. Also, she was much better at school than me.\u201d</p> <p>She was successful even as a 14-year-old, with a bit part on <em>Law &amp; Order</em>, one of the tried-and-tested stepping stones for an emerging actor. But she says she learned a valuable lesson as a teenager: that if one door closes, maybe it was meant to be, because another will surely open. \u201cI was up for a part in <em>The Sound of Music</em> on Broadway, and I was completely devastated when I didn\u2019t get it. It was like someone died. And my mum said, \u2018It\u2019s happening for a reason, just wait.\u2019 And soon afterwards I got this part in <em>Random Hearts</em>, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/27/obituaries\">Sydney Pollack</a> movie, which was incredible.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4a4f639d079d92f27145d85ba2446d9cbe24f12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4a4f639d079d92f27145d85ba2446d9cbe24f12/58_179_3619_2172/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Picture this: In 127 Hours with James Franco and Amber Tamblyn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Picture this: In 127 Hours with James Franco and Amber Tamblyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C.Fox Search/Everett/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It stood her in good stead when she moved to LA with Bruno. Her fortunes turned slowly but surely \u2013 when she was 22 she got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/brokeback-mountain\"><em>Brokeback Mountain</em></a>, playing Heath Ledger\u2019s daughter, a role that changed the course of her career. \u201cAt the audition, I didn\u2019t understand what a big deal it was to read for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/anglee\">Ang [Lee</a>, the director], so there was less pressure,\u201d she remembers. \u201cBut he was so gentle and quiet, it felt like he was rooting for me.\u201d She likens Lee to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/david-fincher\">David Fincher</a>, whom she worked with on <em>House of Cards</em>. \u201cThey\u2019re both very specific directors. Like, don\u2019t blink so much, don\u2019t raise your eyebrows\u2026 I crave that now, but making <em>Brokeback Mountain</em>, I didn\u2019t understand. I just thought I was doing a terrible job and I was going to be fired!\u201d</p> <p>Doors started to open. Movies like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/10/dvd-review-transsiberian\"><em>Transsiberian</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/28/127-hours-danny-boyle-review\"><em>127 Hours</em></a> got her name ever closer to the poster, and then <em>House of Cards </em>changed everything. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/fantastic-four\"><em>Fantastic Four</em></a>, where she met Bell, followed but wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing \u2013 widely panned, it garnered just 9% of positivity on <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/\">rottentomatoes.com</a>, a hub of movie criticism.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the career of the other Mara \u2013 Rooney \u2013 was soaring. Twice nominated for an Oscar, she may have entered the business long after Kate, but she has arguably surpassed her in many ways. The rivalry narrative doesn\u2019t wash. \u201cI know conflict is more interesting,\u201d says Mara, \u201cbut honestly, I just feel so grateful that we\u2019re both living our dreams successfully and to be able to share that with someone you grew up with \u2013 it\u2019s really special.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1be9dda8d0caaddb337ea04c51875c74cadcc8df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1be9dda8d0caaddb337ea04c51875c74cadcc8df/84_105_1747_1048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sister act: Kate, left, with her sister and fellow actor, Rooney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sister act: Kate, left, with her sister and fellow actor, Rooney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pace/BEI/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So they\u2019ve never been up for the same job? They are both the same height, they look somewhat similar\u2026 \u201cWe would be the last to know,\u201d she says. \u201cOur agents would never tell us. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s happened. But maybe there are producers out there laughing, saying, \u2018Haha, it happened yesterday and we hired your sister!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not as though Kate\u2019s phone isn\u2019t ringing. These days, she\u2019s preparing to shoot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/15/sam-taylor-johnson-chappaquiddick-ted-kennedy-thriller\"><em>Chappaquiddick</em></a>, playing the part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/26/edward-kennedy-chappaquiddick-kopechne\">Mary Jo Kopechne</a>, the girl who was found dead in Ted Kennedy\u2019s car in a canal after a party in Martha\u2019s Vineyard in 1969. \u201cMore politics after <em>House of Cards</em>,\u201d she says. \u201cBut don\u2019t ask me about actual politics. I hate what\u2019s happening in this country.\u201d</p> <p>She is also producing her first movie, <em>Mercy</em>, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ellenpage\">Ellen Page</a>, about the death penalty. \u201cI spend a lot of my time watching really depressing documentaries,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat confuses me is why the death penalty is considered the bigger punishment \u2013 I think being locked in a box for the rest of your life is worse.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2932b1d99e86f7f57fd3a9ecae6787253647e9b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2932b1d99e86f7f57fd3a9ecae6787253647e9b6/32_131_2255_1353/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two of a kind: with boyfriend Jamie Bell, whom she met while making the film, Fantastic Four.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two of a kind: with boyfriend Jamie Bell, whom she met while making the film, Fantastic Four.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Baron/BEI/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact, after this interview she might do some more grim capital punishment research. But there are so many other things to get to \u2013 it\u2019s not all about work. A dedicated vegan, she is an outspoken animal welfare advocate, working principally with the Humane Society. Her current campaigns include trying to save chimps in Liberia, putting an end to the dogs of the horrific Yulin dog meat festival in China and protecting the marine life of SeaWorld. \u201cHave you seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/08/tilikum-seaworld-orlando-killer-whale-trainer-blackfish\">Blackfish</a>?\u201d she asks. \u201cThat movie destroyed me. I cried for weeks.\u201d</p> <p>And then there are her hobbies. Mara seldom finds a physical pursuit she doesn\u2019t like. For now, she\u2019s busy with ballet and boxing classes \u2013 she had to take them to prepare for <em>Morgan</em>, and now she can\u2019t give up. But she\u2019s also into ice skating. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to know!\u201d she laughs. \u201cI\u2019m all about looking for the next thing to be good at. Like, I\u2019d love to be a great tap dancer, too.\u201d</p> <p>That fierce ambition that brought her out to LA has mellowed. Some days, she\u2019ll just work out, read a script and then go to dinner. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m getting much done, but I love it. When people ask, \u2018Where do you want to be in 10 years?\u2019 I just say that I hope I\u2019m still acting. Oh and kids, sure. Kids are compulsory in my family, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>She shrugs and gestures to the street, the hills in the background. \u201cI think what\u2019s changed is that I\u2019m home now. It took a while, but I feel like I belong here.\u201d</p> <p>Morgan<em> is released in cinemas on 2 September</em></p>"
