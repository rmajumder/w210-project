  "<p>\u2018Hiking the Caucasus for a few months would be incredible, like going across a continent in miniature. The spectacular terrain ranges from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/georgia\">Georgia</a>\u2019s dense forest and glaciers to the rugged pasturelands of Azerbaijan. But it\u2019s the hospitality of the locals that makes trekking here really special.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Stephens, co-founder of the new Transcaucasian Trail (TCT), is talking about why he thinks this will be one of the world\u2019s greatest hikes. He and a team of mappers and volunteers are in Georgia working on the first section of the route across the Caucasus.</p> <p>The region is on the border of Europe and Asia, between the Black and Caspian seas. The eventual aim is to have two 1,500km trails \u2013 one running east to west, linking the seas, and the other running north to south, linking the Greater and Lesser Caucasus mountain ranges \u2013 largely paid for by crowdfunding.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bb44501ec8efdb814dee81ed2dc5597fce85880\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bb44501ec8efdb814dee81ed2dc5597fce85880/0_302_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volunteers digging the path in Svaneti.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volunteers digging the path.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Allen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The trail, a mix of existing routes and new paths, is being developed in stages and the first is the 200km section between Svaneti and Racha in north-west Georgia. Last year, Paul and co-founder Jeff Haack scouted and mapped the route along an old trail that connects villages in Western Svaneti. Since July this year they have been working with volunteers to build the path, moving obstacles, building bridges and putting up trail markers.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to make it less of a cow path and more of an easy-to-follow hiking trail,\u201d says Paul. Volunteers from all over the world have spent up to eight weeks on the project, which ends for this year on 28 August. Once this first section is completed, mappers will make a guide and upload a GPS track ready for use in the autumn. \u201cThe plan is to finish the 200km section, have a guide, get it out there and get people hiking it,\u201d says Paul.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve tried to make it less of a cow path and more of an easy-to-follow hiking trail</p> <footer> <cite>Paul Stephens, Transcaucasian Trail co-founder</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The TCT will open up largely unexplored areas, giving access to historic sites and protected areas, such as Ushguli, the highest permanently inhabited village in Europe. It will also increase economic opportunities for local communities and link around two dozen national parks.</p> <p>Paul started hiking here when he came to Georgia from the US 11 years ago as a Peace Corps volunteer. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly beautiful,\u201d he says. \u201cThe national parks are incredible but can be inaccessible. For the incredible biodiversity of Georgia to be preserved, people need to appreciate these areas. It\u2019s a tiny country but it\u2019s so diverse. Being able to walk for a few weeks and see these different landscapes and cultures is amazing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8a9db230ff790ec46e25a3cb0e34ae4b517e890\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8a9db230ff790ec46e25a3cb0e34ae4b517e890/0_79_1056_634/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A village in the peaks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A village in the peaks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Scipioni</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next step is to raise more cash from crowdfunding, corporate sponsorship and grants, to have trail-building programmes in multiple locations, including Armenia, where another team has already started scouting the north-south route. Based on other trails worldwide, costs are estimated at $1,000-1,500 per kilometre, a total of $3-5m.</p> <p>Paul says that although the manual work is \u201cintense\u201d, volunteers get to see little-visited areas of Georgia. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to experience a fascinating part of the world and spend time in beautiful landscapes, doing and learning something new.\u201d <br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://transcaucasiantrail.org/en/about/\"><em>transcaucasiantrail.org</em></a></p>",
  "<p>The hate that dared not speak its name was in fine voice this week. In a grand Washington townhouse behind the supreme court, the air was thick with talk of what Donald Trump would do for white Americans. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/jared-taylor-alt-right-clinton-trump\">'The races are not equal': meet the alt-right leader in Clinton's campaign ad</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cEveryone says we\u2019re a nation of immigrants but we\u2019re not,\u201d said one man, proudly sporting a Trump T-shirt. \u201cWe\u2019re a nation of northern European immigrants. We shouldn\u2019t have to pay more just to live among our own demographic.\u201d <br></p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d agreed the woman next him. \u201cMy family go back to the 1680s.\u201d</p> <p>The party, thrown by Breitbart News, former employer of Trump\u2019s new campaign chief Steve Bannon, was given a further veneer of respectability by an author signing a table full of hardbacks with Latin in the title. Ann Coulter\u2019s new book, <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/07/11/trump-trust-pluribus-awesome-ann-coulter-book-cover/\">In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!</a>, echoed the racially triumphant mood.</p> <p> \u201cThe same way virtually any immigrant to Finland makes it less white, almost any immigrant to America makes it less honest,\u201d Coulter writes in her 182-page hagiography. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing Trump can do that won\u2019t be forgiven. Except change his immigration policies.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately, at the very moment of the book-signing, that was exactly what Trump was doing.</p> <p>In an interview on Fox News, the struggling Republican candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/donald-trump-immigration-reform-sean-hannity-fox-news\">dramatically rowed back</a> on his signature pledge to deport undocumented immigrants, seemingly hoping to recapture moderates alarmed by the stridency of what he appears to have unleashed. </p> <p>The electoral risk posed by Trump\u2019s flirtation with white nationalism was underlined a day later, when Hillary Clinton used links to so-called \u201calt-right\u201d thinkers to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/25/hillary-clinton-alt-right-racism-speech-donald-trump-nevada\">mount her fiercest attack yet</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe de facto merger between Breitbart and the Trump campaign represents a landmark achievement for the \u2018alt-right\u2019,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cA fringe element has effectively taken over the Republican party. All of this adds up to something we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d </p> <p>She added: \u201cThis is not conservatism as we have known it. This is not Republicanism as we have known it. These are racist ideas, race-baiting ideas, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-women, all key tenets making up the emerging racist ideology known as the alt-right.\u201d</p> <p>The speech drew <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/08/25/hillary-clinton-calls-31-million-breitbart-readers-racist-klansmen/\">fury</a> from Trump and Breitbart, which accused Clinton of slandering its readers and \u201clabel[ing] 31 million people as racists, simply because they don\u2019t agree with her\u201d. </p> <p>But one need not dig far to find evidence of what Clinton is talking about. Breitbart itself recently claimed the real fascists and racists in America \u2013 the true \u201c<a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/04/26/anti-white-racism-hate-dares-not-speak-name-2/\">hate that dares not speak its name</a>\u201d \u2013 were the \u201cprogressive mob\u201d that \u201cplaces whites at the bottom of the racial totem pole\u201d. </p> <p>For critics of the alt-right, the question now is less whether Trump\u2019s backpedalling can save his presidential campaign, but whether the dark forces he has unleashed can ever be put back in the box.</p> <p>\u201cFor white supremacists right now, this is really a moment to cheer,\u201d said Heidi Beirich, of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which monitors hate groups and extremists across the US. \u201cThe first conservative media outlet to embrace white nationalism is merging with the Republican campaign. </p> <p>\u201cThe ideas that they are pushing are the same ones that motivate the alt-right \u2013 a rebranding of old white nationalism and an attempt to give respectability to ideas that had long been unacceptable in the American mainstream.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3272a73c5b3cd754ddd0dee829f75ee22c73062d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3272a73c5b3cd754ddd0dee829f75ee22c73062d/0_424_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-Trump protesters demonstrate outside a meeting between Donald Trump and minority Republicans at Trump Tower in New York on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-Trump protesters demonstrate outside a meeting between Donald Trump and minority Republicans at Trump Tower in New York on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bebeto Matthews/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The SPLC claims there has been an alarming increase in violent attacks since Trump began to legitimise what were previously fringe views on immigration and race.</p> <p>It points to Dylann Roof\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charleston-shooting\">shooting dead of nine black people</a> in a church in Charleston last June, the recent <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-shooting-idUSKCN10O0X4\">killing of a Muslim cleric in New York</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/08/23/murder-charge-for-tulsa-man-in-slaying-lebanese-neighbor.html\">racially charged murder of a Lebanese man in Oklahoma</a> as examples of what could be to come even if Trump loses.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a lot of political violence in the last eight years and this might be something that comes up again if Trump is unsuccessful,\u201d said Beirich, in a conference call with reporters. </p> <p>\u201cWe are concerned about domestic terrorism and an organised white nationalist political movement and these are all things that Trump and Steven Bannon have bequeathed us.\u201d</p> <p>For Trump \u2013 who called the Charleston murders \u201c<a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/donald-trump-charleston-shooting\">incomprehensible</a>\u201d \u2013 these are slurs from a liberal left that is running out of ideas for addressing the bigger challenge: lifting African Americans and legal Latino migrants out of poverty.</p> <p>\u201cShe is a bigot,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/25/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-bigot/\">he said of Clinton</a>. \u201cShe is selling them down the tubes because she\u2019s not doing anything for those communities.

The candidate echoed the presidential campaign slogan with a billboard that read: \u201cMake America White Again.\u201d</p> <p>Online, prominent alt-right figures happily describe themselves as \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ricky_Vaughn99/\">American nationalists</a>\u201d, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/769029726556028929\">poke fun at the media\u2019s political correctness</a> and accuse Clinton of supporting \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HouseCracka/status/769157839810023424\">Black Panthers who want to murder crackers</a>\u201d.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s focus on immigration has arguably raised the temperature offline too. In Virginia, for example, a <a href=\"http://ktla.com/2016/08/22/we-only-tip-citizens-latina-waitress-in-virginia-receives-hateful-message-instead-of-tip/\">Latina waitress attracted national attention after she received a racist note instead of a tip</a>. \u201cWe only tip citizens,\u201d read the scrawl on the cheque.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/alt-right-movement-white-identity-breitbart-donald-trump\">\u2018A sense that white identity is under attack\u2019: making sense of the alt-right</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Veteran civil rights campaigners think there is no going back for the Trump campaign \u2013 only the hope that enough people vote against him to limit his future impact on the national debate.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s afraid his xenophobia, his racism, is going to wreck his chances for the White House,\u201d said Ben Jealous, a former president of the <a href=\"http://www.naacp.org/\">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a>, pointing to Trump\u2019s history of questioning Obama\u2019s nationality as an example of a long track record. </p> <p>\u201cBut his problems with race are set in stone, there is no going back on it.

  "<p>Australian children who were not white and middle class were all but invisible in children\u2019s books, the author Maxine Beneba Clarke said in her keynote address at the opening of the Melbourne writers festival on Friday night.</p> <p>Clarke, 36, is from an Afro-Caribbean background. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-books-blog/2016/aug/10/the-accumulative-effects-of-racism-it-eats-away-at-the-essence-of-your-being\">Her writing, including her recent memoir, The Hate Race</a>, has been praised for its passion and originality about issues of casual racism in Australia.</p> <p>She told the audience that children in wheelchairs, or those who wore headscarves, or who were being raised by single or same-sex parents, or who lived in public housing or had brown skin, rarely saw themselves in books. It had a profound impact on their sense of themselves and their place in Australia, and she urged publishers to take more risks when considering children\u2019s books.</p> <p>\u201cBooks render them invisible, that their stories are not important,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is the right of every child to see themselves in story.\u201d</p> <p>In an address that began with a poetry performance piece about race and children, Clarke said she was 19 before she read a novel with a central character who looked like her, and it was a revelation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-books-blog/2016/aug/10/the-accumulative-effects-of-racism-it-eats-away-at-the-essence-of-your-being\">The accumulative effects of racism: it eats away at the essence of your being</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It followed a Sydney childhood in which she and her sister worried at every school Book Week about dressing up as a character from literature.

Under existing law, copyright protections mean authors are paid if their work is reproduced, with public interest exceptions such as news stories.</p> <p>\u201cWe must resist this path to oblivion,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The opening of the festival also saw the winner of the prestigious Miles Franklin award announced. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/26/the-most-momentous-news-of-my-life-as-patric-wins-miles-franklin-award\">A.S.
