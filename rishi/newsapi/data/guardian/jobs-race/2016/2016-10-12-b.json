Southgate\u2019s chances of being offered the job properly will hinge more on England\u2019s games against Scotland and Spain next month and the former Middlesbrough manager sounded like he was growing into the idea of taking on the position, in stark contrast to his admission after Roy Hodgson\u2019s departure about not being ready for it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a remarkable experience,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cI feel stronger and more confident for it, and I recognise the responsibility it brings.</p> <p>\u201cI could not have been happier with the approach of the players or the staff, and I think we have prepared them to be in the best possible place to get the results we wanted.

  "<p>The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development is correct that it\u2019s time to take stock of policy on young people, university education and the jobs market (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/11/huge-increase-in-number-of-graduates-bad-for-uk-economy\" title=\"\">End drive to send more to university, say HR experts</a>, 11 October), but we need a much wider remit than their narrow parameters. We need a fundamental rethink about the world of work and the purpose of education within it. We must ask the most basic question of all: what is education for?</p> <p>At a time when the adult skills budget has been cut by more than 40% since 2010, when parents struggle to afford childcare, when students leave university with a lifetime of debt, and when the curriculum is becoming so narrow that the only achievements that count are those that can be weighed and measured against the needs of the market, a reminder that education is in fact a public good is vitally necessary.</p> <p>We should cherish education for education\u2019s sake, not just because it provides work fodder, subject to an ever changing market. That\u2019s why Labour\u2019s national education service deserves strong consideration. It recognises the value that investment in free education from cradle to grave can offer society, while not denying the need for benefit to the economy and business in a fast moving technologically advanced world. The CIPD is correct that the quality of courses on offer at all levels must be a high priority, but that requires a radical and credible alternative that will bring back equality of opportunity, fairness and, dare I say it, joy into education.<br><strong>Carol Machell</strong><br><em>Retired headteacher and former Ofsted inspector, Todmorden, West Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 While the high cost of degree study makes it inevitable that students and society consider the value of these, it is depressing that the sole considerations seem to be the jobs graduates will take up and the amount they will earn. When I went to university in the 1970s, there was a clear perception that educating oneself was a valuable end in itself. We know that the educational prospects for children are higher when their parents have been through higher education. Recent polls have shown that social and political attitudes are powerfully affected by the level of education. People\u2019s lives are enriched by education and the intellectual and cultural doors it opens. There is even a link between level of education and life expectancy. The decision to transfer most of the cost of their education on to students has resulted in the commodification of learning, to the detriment of all.<br><strong>Jill Wallis</strong><br><em>Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 The CIPD research shows that \u201cfor many graduates, the costs of university education outweigh its personal economic benefits\u201d and that graduates are colonising jobs that school leavers used to obtain. So the massive expansion of higher education has harmed the financial prospects of the 52% of young people who don\u2019t go to university, as well as many of those who do.</p> <p>There can be personal and social benefits of higher education of course, but I suspect these may be very small for the large number of people who attend a non-Russell Group university and need to do long hours of paid work at the same time. If the aim of the expansion was to prevent higher education being dominated by the better-off, then it has been a very expensive way of possibly achieving very little, as the better-off now target the Russell Group universities. Positive discrimination at those institutions would be more cost-effective.<br><strong>Richard Mountford</strong><br><em>Tonbridge, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 Two major criticisms can be made of the CIPD recommendation not to expand student numbers. First, any further expansion would include, probably disproportionately, those from poorer backgrounds and from families which have no previous experience of higher education. A reduction in or failure to increase student numbers means that graduate jobs, however defined, will be taken by the relatively advantaged. Second, the costing misses out the non-monetary aspect of education. One does not have to be too idealistic to believe that three years in which to argue, think, read and reflect \u2013 which will, hopefully, result in intellectual and social development \u2013 is an individual and collective good that should be available to as many people as possible.

  "<p>A new analysis has found racial disparities in the police use of force across different Austin neighborhoods, even when controlling for neighborhood crime rates and income levels.<br></p> <p>The new study, which used data released as part of a White House initiative launched last year, finds that the strongest predictor of the number of police use of force incidents in different neighborhoods is the crime rates in those neighborhoods.</p> <p>But even controlling for crime rates, income and education levels, and rates of home ownership, black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Texas city still see a slightly higher number of use of force incidents, the new analysis found. Every 1% increase in the proportion of black residents in a neighborhood led to a 2.6% increase in use of force incidents, according to the analysis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">The Counted: people killed by police in the United States \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a highly segregated city such as Austin, that increase actually looks much larger when you apply it to the neighborhood level. Virtually all the neighborhoods on the city\u2019s west side are less than 5% black, while many on the east side are closer to 60% black. Using the report\u2019s findings, that could mean an increase in use of force of more than 140% from a typical white neighborhood to a typical black one after controlling for other variables. The use of force incidents measured included anything from use of a closed fist through use of batons, pepper spray and tasers, all the way to deadly force.</p> <p>The new results line up with previous studies that have found clear racial disparities in police use of force. The analysis does not look specifically at racial disparities in fatal use of force, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/black-men-minorities-killed-police-encounters-study\">the most controversial area of research.</a></p> <p>\u201cWhat it tells me is that we still have more work to do,\u201d said Art Acevedo, Austin\u2019s police chief of nearly a decade. \u201cWe have to continue to work in terms of our training on implicit and explicit bias for our department.\u201d</p> <p>But he said he believed that releasing the findings would help continue to build trust with the community, and that they would help the department improve in the long run. </p> <p>\u201cYou can be an ostrich as a leader, and bury your head in the sand, or you can be forward-thinking and be scanning the environment constantly for threats or for opportunities to do better,\u201d Acevedo said.</p> <p>Austin is the first city in the country to go public with this kind of in-depth analysis of use of force disparities, a step that the White House, researchers, and the city\u2019s police chief say they hope other departments will follow.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t say enough about Chief Acevedo\u2019s willingness to put it all out there,\u201d said Roy Austin, a White House domestic policy adviser focused on urban affairs, justice and opportunity. \u201cWe need more chiefs to step up like Chief Acevedo has done and say, \u2018I have nothing to hide. Policing belongs to the community and we are going to show the community exactly what we are doing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The Austin analysis was conducted independently by researchers from the Center for Policing Equity and the Urban Institute.</p> <p>Black Americans are more likely to be subject to fatal and nonfatal use of police force than white Americans. The Guardian\u2019s long-term investigation on police killings, the Counted, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">consistently found that black Americans are more than twice as likely than white Americans to be killed by the police.</a> What\u2019s less clear are the reasons behind this disparity, and what it would take to erase it.</p> <p>Is the disparity purely based on community factors, such as crime levels or poverty? Is it driven by police department policies or individual police officer racial bias? Or does the disparity in use of force stem from dynamics between police and communities \u2013 such as Americans of some races being more likely to flee from the police in confrontations, or police officers responding to greater hostility toward the police in some neighborhoods rather than others?</p> <p>The report argues that \u201cthe truth likely incorporates elements of each of these\u201d, but that only better data and analysis can help reformers be more specific in finding where the fault lines are.</p> <p>Previous studies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/reality-check/2016/jul/11/study-finds-no-racial-bias-police-shootings-data\">including a Harvard working paper released in July,</a> found racial disparities in non-fatal police use of force, even controlling for a variety of factors \u2013 including police officers\u2019 own descriptions of how compliant citizens were. The Harvard study found, in an in-depth analysis of Houston data, that black Americans were actually less likely, not more likely, than other Americans to be shot by the police, a controversial finding. It\u2019s not clear to what extent the results in Houston or nine other areas the study examined in less depth might be representative of national trends.</p> <p>The racial disparities in Austin\u2019s use of force \u201care not direct evidence of racial prejudice\u201d, the analysts from the Center for Policing Equity and the Urban Institute concluded. But by controlling for community-level factors, the researchers said, they could demonstrate that police factors or factors driven by the police-community relationship must play some role. </p> <p>\u201cOnce again, we can say that crime is not sufficient to explain the racial disparities we see for both black and Latinos in the use of force,\u201d said Phillip Atiba Goff, the lead researcher on the analysis.</p> <p>The new analysis draws from two different initiatives exploring police use of force data: the White House\u2019s Police Data Initiative, launched last year, which encourages departments to post public data about their use of force, and the National Justice Database, a National Science Foundation-funded effort to build a standardized national database about police use of force, which keeps its data private.</p> <p>Austin is the first city in either of these efforts to agree to publicly release an in-depth analysis of its use of force data. Goff said the city-level study was designed to create a standardized model for other departments to analyze and then share their use of force data. Through the National Justice Database, departments can share data and have these analyses made privately available to them. Whether departments choose to release the results of their analyses publicly is up to police leaders, Goff said.</p> <p>\u201cThese are scary questions to ask,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m a chief, I don\u2019t know how well my department is doing on these issues. I can reasonably worry, if the analyses reveal something that is disturbing to the community, I\u2019m kicking a hornet\u2019s nest.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t fix a problem that you don\u2019t know you have.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/31/the-counted-police-killings-2015-young-black-men\">Young black men killed by US police at highest rate in year of 1,134 deaths</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Acevedo, the Austin chief, said: \u201cMy cops will not be surprised by the fact that we\u2019re participating in this. We will talk to them about the fact that there is a use of force disparity, and our next step for us is that we continue to evaluate our training in terms of de-escalation.\u201d</p> <p> The challenge with Austin being the only department so far to release this analysis so far, Acevedo said, was that \u201cthere\u2019s no other points of reference.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s not clear how Austin\u2019s neighborhood use of force disparities might compare with other large cities. \u201cAs a profession, we\u2019re only good as the weakest department in the nation,\u201d Acevedo said. \u201cWe\u2019re all a reflection of one another.\u201d</p> <p><strong> </strong>Unlike prior studies, this new report doesn\u2019t rely on the race of the individual citizens involved to draw its conclusions, but rather, looks at the demographics of the neighborhoods where the use of force incidents occurred. This, according to Goff, is the best way to understand how community-level factors such as crime, income and education might influence the disparate racial application of force.</p> <p>Policing \u201cis a neighborhood-by-neighborhood profession\u201d, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how it\u2019s experienced.\u201d</p> <p>The Austin neighborhood report also looked at traffic stops and found that black drivers of all ages were searched more frequently than white or Hispanic drivers. In addition, black drivers did not see the same reductions in stops with age that white and Hispanic drivers experienced. The report concedes, however, that the findings are \u201cunable to control for drivers\u2019 differential involvement in illegal activity or exposure to police\u201d and cannot be taken by themselves as proof of bias in stops.</p>",

And then I had to take care of some things in the country house, and I remember waiting because I was looking forward to what it would be. He eventually told me it was about mascots. A really interesting world... you can make a living by being a mascot! There\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiSBpW2J1a8\">documentary on Hulu</a> <strong>(4)</strong> that you can watch. There\u2019s a father with a kids and a wife, and there\u2019s the younger guy who can\u2019t quite leave college. He\u2019s been eight years in college because he\u2019s been a mascot. He loves it because all the girls come up to him, smile at him. They go to grocery stores and hospitals and birthday parties. It\u2019s a service, they make people happy. I mean, it\u2019s basically a giant stuffed animal walking around.</p> <p>The town my character Cindi <strong>(5)</strong> is from is so small. Where would she even get the foam to make a costume like that? It\u2019s really expensive. It was her idea to be an armadillo for this all-female basketball team.</p> <p><strong>Purely for financial reasons?</strong></p> <p>I think she wants to dance. This is a young woman who likes to cheer and wants to dance \u2013 she wanted to express herself, so she went to the president of the school to say: \u201cThis team needs a mascot!\u201d I think she chose an armadillo because it\u2019s a strong creature \u2013 and it looks like a basketball.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5e54c4d55ea60453afa128eb2b91d6b4a6d5cbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5e54c4d55ea60453afa128eb2b91d6b4a6d5cbd/0_0_4535_2721/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Susan Yeagley and Parker Posey as sisters in Mascots\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Susan Yeagley and Parker Posey as sisters in Mascots</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Garfield/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>I\u2019m sensing you created a full backstory for the character.</strong></p> <p>I have to, to have it make sense.

It was everything to me.</p> <p>I do press and stuff, and often think about movies and what\u2019s happened to them. There are so few movies that still cast on chemistry.

You know, games, the gaming world, the fantasy world to be so strong. Gaming, fantasy, blockbuster books, movies \u2013 and now we have sports. But we don\u2019t really have the dialogue about film that we had in the 90s with [Quentin] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/quentintarantino\">Tarantino</a>.

  "<p>As Scotland\u2019s party shuffled away from the Stadion Antona Malatinskeho on Tuesday night, the fallout from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/slovakia-scotland-world-cup-qualifier-match-report\" title=\"\">another wounding loss</a> still ringing in their ears, there was cause for optimism from Hanover. Had Northern Ireland claimed anything from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/germany-northern-ireland-world-cup-qualifier-match-report\" title=\"\">their meeting with Germany</a>, Michael O\u2019Neill would have become even more unattainable to the Scottish FA than may already be the case.</p> <p>He is by far the outstanding candidate to replace Gordon Strachan when \u2013 and it is now when \u2013 the latter\u2019s increasingly unsatisfactory to the point of untenable alliance with Scotland comes to an end.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/gordon-strachan-scotland-slovakia-world-cup-qualifier\">Gordon Strachan says we \u2018gave it our best shot\u2019 after Scotland defeat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>O\u2019Neill\u2019s managerial style personifies everything that Scotland so lacks, he has an inherent understanding of football in the country and doesn\u2019t carry the dismissive public attitude which has lost Strachan so many admirers in recent months. Austin MacPhee, a 37-year-old from Fife, is a key part of O\u2019Neill\u2019s backroom team and rightly regarded as an analytical genius where football is concerned. Together they typify the maximising of every available ounce of talent from the fundamental cornerstone of making a team difficult to beat. Northern Ireland have proved the example Strachan\u2019s Scotland cannot touch.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill\u2019s work with Northern Ireland, a country of far less football standing and resource than Scotland, means the courting of his services should be a complete no-brainer. A glance at O\u2019Neill\u2019s relatively paltry substitutes\u2019 bench for each game highlights the scale of his work. His knowledge of virtually every player within Northern Ireland\u2019s system from the age of 15 upwards sets the 47-year-old apart from his peers.</p> <p>Northern Ireland entered Tuesday night\u2019s match with a record of no qualifying tie defeats since November 2014. They had conceded three goals in nine international games. All the while, Scotland under Strachan have flipped between varying forms of crisis as the manager seems to try to delude a clued-up public.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill may have other thoughts, of course. His standing is such that he should be easily worthy of a decent club post in England. The Scottish international scene has become so attached to failure that the key job is perhaps viewed as damaging to a coach\u2019s career. Scotland\u2019s slide into the international wilderness is such that perhaps O\u2019Neill is not even affordable.</p> <p>But the Scottish FA has a duty to at least try, thereby showing ambition in saving people from the latest spell of drudgery which constitutes following this international team. Almost two years will now pass before a qualifying match of consequence, save the rabble-rousing which inevitably attaches itself to meeting the Auld Enemy.</p> <p>Nobody else among those linked with the position touches O\u2019Neill\u2019s standing including the favourite, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/28/blackburn-paul-lambert-leave-end-of-season\" title=\"\">a recently failed manager</a>, Paul Lambert. Alex McLeish has considerably more of a claim but Scotland have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/27/newsstory.birminghamcityfc2\" title=\"\">been there, seen it, done it</a> and not qualified with him before. Neither of this duo would have glanced twice at Scotland when looking to make Premier League inroads not so long ago. Lars Lagerback, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/25/iceland-england-euro-2016-coach-lars-lagerback\" title=\"\">so successful with Iceland</a>, is more worthy of attention.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d31ce600c6deb3f1506065278939f5a2c5e84259\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d31ce600c6deb3f1506065278939f5a2c5e84259/919_633_3459_2076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Mak\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Mak scored twice in Slovakia\u2019s 3-0 win against Scotland and Gordon Strachan\u2019s substitutions offered little to help his side going forward.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vladimir Simicek/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First, the association must clean up this unseemly scenario around Strachan. The 59-year-old actually owes it to his country to step down from his job \u2013 as he has done elsewhere \u2013 such was the lame nature of Scotland\u2019s showing in defeat to Slovakia. They had been no better when salvaging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/08/scotland-lithuania-world-cup-qualifier-group-f-match-report\" title=\"\">a last-minute draw against Lithuania</a> just days earlier.</p> <p>Strachan offered Tuesday night commentary which was effusive of his squad to the point where onlookers, once again, had cause to believe their intelligence was being insulted. He may well <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/gordon-strachan-scotland-slovakia-world-cup-qualifier\" title=\"\">feel rejuvenated when at work</a> but the combined effect on supporters is quite the opposite. Strachan\u2019s His ego and the relatively short timeframe between fixtures may well mutually carry this manager to Wembley and a once eagerly anticipated meeting with England when the reality should be the following of a new path. Strachan himself would probably even benefit from that.</p> <p>The boring tactical stuff, which Strachan likes to swat aside questioning of, is damning. He set out a team against Lithuania which looked devoid of any plan. It had no means by which to run beyond an average defence or expose the vast space available in midfield from Lithuania deploying a 4-4-2 formation. Scotland were laboured to the point of instantly boring an expectant Hampden crowd.</p> <p>In Slovakia, Strachan not only left both full-backs woefully exposed from the kick-off but named a team carrying not nearly enough speed to counterattack properly.</p> <p>The hosts\u2019 second goal saw Scotland picked off by the length of the pitch, not at pace but because the team had no ability to retain its shape. Even then, there was no apparent desire, let alone desperation, to keep the ball out of their own goal. In For more than a campaign now, Scotland have lost schoolboy-level goals to the point where it is legitimate to ask how and with whom their defence is drilled.</p> <p>This all reflects on Strachan, as does his grasping in the dark for players to fit pre-determined systems. Selections lack consistency and logic. Leipzig\u2019s Oliver Burke, raw but talented and brimming with confidence, went from starting pick to not within a squad of 23 within days.</p> <p>Barrie McKay and Steven Naismith were not even required to board the plane to Slovakia despite being named in the original Scotland party for October\u2019s double-header. Strachan had spent time at his media conference last Friday insisting how McKay, a winger, had excelled in training. Come Tuesday, when 3-0 down against a limited Slovak team, he was throwing on the essentially workmanlike midfielder John McGinn in place of a striker.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/slovakia-scotland-world-cup-qualifier-match-report\">Slovakia sink Scotland to pile pressure on Gordon Strachan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Willie Miller was a team-mate of Strachan in the all-conquering Aberdeen team of the 1980s and actually one pundit to call events of a year ago astutely. Scotland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/11/gibraltar-scotland-euro-2016-qualifier-match-report\" title=\"\">brushed Gibraltar aside</a> 6-0 in conclusion to the failed Euro 2016 qualifying campaign as Strachan took to the field with his squad and posed for photos in front of a celebrating support. Miller, rightly, questioned the value in this jubilant image when another tournament was about to pass Scotland by. The party was offset by the missing out of a key one, in France during the summer.</p> <p>The upshot was a sense that Strachan was doing Scotland a favour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/16/scotland-gordon-strachan-contract-extension\" title=\"\">by agreeing a new deal</a> and, in truth, there seemed little logic in dispensing with yet another manager. Nonetheless, it was reasonable to expect something even remotely resembling progress, which has been so painfully absent during these intervening months. As a generation continues without living knowledge of Scotland in a major championship, the team has never looked further away from rejoining international football\u2019s top table.</p> <p>Strachan has been handsomely rewarded for a part-time job on a full-time salary, showing little regard at all for Scottish football itself other than where a public relations or broadcasting opportunity arises. His wish to cure inherent football ills in the country coincidentally came at the end of that European Championship campaign, where Scotland finished behind the Republic of Ireland and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/04/georgia-scotland-euro-2016-qualifying-match-report\" title=\"\">lost horrendously in Georgia</a>. As international manager, Strachan\u2019s solitary task and route to positive influence is by winning matches, not pontificating about boys\u2019 clubs.</p> <p>Wider problems are well known and well stated. They should not, however, be deliberately confused with an underperforming and rudderless national team.

Yankunytjatjara man Yami Lester stands on the deep red earth next to a single skinny tree. His brown jacket reflects the muted landscape. His hands are clasped on his chest as if in pain, and his eyes, tilted to the sky, are scrunched shut. Yami Lester, you see, is blind.</p> <p>Lester was just a child when the British tested the atomic bomb near his home in the Australian outback, in what came to be known as Maralinga. \u201cIt was coming from the south \u2013 black, like smoke,\u201d he later recalled. \u201cI was thinking it might be a dust storm, but it was quiet, just moving through the trees.\u201d </p> <p>Elders thought it was an evil spirit and tried to use <em>woomera</em> (spear-throwers) to disperse it. But the damage was done. Lester\u2019s family soon fell sick. He lost his sight. The trees, too, shrank, shrivelled and died.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d9276ad9f442a8d066a7eb91c9c68ebd9f246f8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9276ad9f442a8d066a7eb91c9c68ebd9f246f8d/0_0_2368_3321/713.jpg\" alt=\"Maralinga Test Dummy, by Craig McDonald.\" width=\"713\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maralinga Test Dummy, by Craig McDonald.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julie Millowick/Craig McDonald</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The national touring exhibition, which runs until 2019, commemorates the 60th anniversary of the Maralinga atomic tests through painting, sculpture, printmaking and installations. Spanning 70 years, from Hiroshima to today, it covers artistic reactions to nuclear warfare from more than 30 artists, Indigenous and non-Indigenous.<br></p> <p>Black Mist Burnt Country may be broad in scope but it concentrates heavily on the infamous 1956 Maralinga tests in South Australia\u2019s Great Victoria Desert. Maralinga is an Aboriginal word for thunder: the cathartic clearing of a stormy sky. In this case, however, the word has taken on a far darker meaning. Indigenous people were forcibly removed from their lands or, if they stayed, suffered horrific injuries. Service and military personal working on the sites, too, were exposed to hazardous radiation.</p> <p>As such, blindness is a central metaphor. Black Mist Burnt Country examines the physical repercussions of atomic tests (from cancer to deformities to loss of sight). Yet blindness also references a government who wilfully ignored repercussions from its actions, shrouded its deeds in secrecy, and shied away from responsibility.</p> <p>Craig McDonald\u2019s 2010 bronze sculpture, Maralinga Test Dummy, shows a man, his body taut with excitement, watching the explosion through a visor. He notes in the catalogue: \u201cBlindness, from viewing the blasts, was a real threat, but this figure explores the notion of a more menacing blindness \u2013 that of ignorance coupled with colonial arrogance.\u201d<br></p> <p>There are meaty issues here, both historical and spiritual. Yet while such themes are explored in Black Mist Burnt Country\u2019s well-researched curatorial essay, the exhibition falls short of telling a coherent story. More detailed information, not to mention placing the works in some sort of timeline rather than their current haphazard arrangement, is badly needed to maximise the full impact of what is essentially a tale of horror.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1755d3d1825df49d373f370d20851fd93590349c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1755d3d1825df49d373f370d20851fd93590349c/0_0_2000_2684/745.jpg\" alt=\"Central Desert: Atomic Test, by Sidney Nolan.\" width=\"745\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Central Desert: Atomic Test, by Sidney Nolan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sidney Nolan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, there are some impressive paintings. They include one of Sidney Nolan\u2019s lesser-known landscapes, not seen by the public until 2001. Central Desert: Atomic Test, painted in the 1950s, shows a terrain so red it is almost raw, like exposed flesh. In the forefront sit mountains the colour of charred bone, and in the distance \u2013 far enough away as to almost be imperceptible \u2013 is a mushroom cloud that explodes against a queasy blue sky.</p> <p>Arthur Boyd, a pacifist, also painted the atomic bomb in his Shoalhaven series. Jonah on the Shoalhaven \u2013 Outside the City (1976) shows Jonah as a half-human, half-animal carcass sprawled under a lone tree. </p> <p>His stomach is ripped open violently, revealing gold coins stored in his guts, and a mushroom explodes in the distance behind the walled city of Nineveh.

Despite, or perhaps because of, their size and quietness, they pack a punch.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6cdbc839d1410ff402d51044d2d9f88f80e8c0f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cdbc839d1410ff402d51044d2d9f88f80e8c0f4/0_0_2681_4220/635.jpg\" alt=\"Maralinga, by Jonathan Kumintjarra Brown.\" width=\"635\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maralinga, by Jonathan Kumintjarra Brown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Kumintjarra Brown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As does Aboriginal artist Jonathan Kumintjarra Brown\u2019s 1992 painting Maralinga. Brown was removed from his family as a child, who were themselves displaced due to the Maralinga tests. In his large canvas Maralinga, a traditional dot painting is blurred by a wash of brick-red sand, rendering its meaning largely lost. Protruding from this exterminated earth is a tiny, delicate lizard skeleton, frozen in the process of destruction.<br></p> <p>Black Mist Burnt Country is an uneven exhibition: it is a shame so many good works lose their reverberations and power in hit-and-miss curating. Leaving the show, however, that small lizard stays with you: it is as apt a symbol as any for the toxic realities of atomic war. </p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"http://blackmistburntcountry.com.au/\">Black Mist Burnt Country</a> is at the </em><em>SH Ervin Gallery</em> <em>and will </em><em>tour NSW, VIC, SA and QLD until 2019</em></p>"
