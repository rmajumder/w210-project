  "<p>Hacked emails, bogus Twitter accounts, smear allegations and backroom deals. Welcome to the race for the international community\u2019s top diplomatic job \u2013 United Nations secretary general.</p> <p>The eventual winner of the contest will ascend to become a secular saint, an ambassador of peace and voice of the poor and downtrodden. But the road to such a lofty position is paved with landmines and booby traps. </p> <p>On Monday, the UN security council will hold the fifth of a series of straw polls aimed at picking a winner from the remaining nine contenders in the race, in which the 15 council members will cast secret ballots. </p> <p>The clear leader to date has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/29/antonio-guterres-united-nations-secretary-general\">Ant\u00f3nio Guterres</a>, the former Portuguese prime minister and UN high commissioner for refugees.

Each contender had to present a personal manifesto before the 193 countries in the general assembly, and Guterres won points for his humour, charisma and mastery of his brief. But his route to the secretary generalship could still be blocked by a veto from one of the five permanent council members, most plausibly Russia. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ab686cfd75d8d0e862e273aefc8dd6e4bd7aff4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ab686cfd75d8d0e862e273aefc8dd6e4bd7aff4/0_1303_2757_1654/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Antonio Guterres\u2019 route to the job could still be blocked by a veto.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Antonio Guterres\u2019 route to the job could still be blocked by a veto.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moscow argues it is the turn of an eastern European to provide the UN leadership, and may balk at the former leader of a western European Nato member state taking the helm.

But the account turned out to be a fake. </p> <p>In second place is Slovakia\u2019s foreign minister, Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, who enjoyed a surprise surge from second last after his country\u2019s pro-Russia prime minister, Robert Fico, visited Moscow <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://euobserver.com/foreign/134722\">four days before</a> the third poll and made a point of highlighting his <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/357330-slovakia-eu-russia-sanctions/\">criticisms of EU sanctions</a> on Russia over Crimea. For that reason, Laj\u010d\u00e1k may face a veto from one or more of the western members of the permanent five.</p> <p>Third-placed Vuk Jeremi\u0107, the former Serbian foreign minister, will almost certainly be vetoed by the US, diplomats say. Washington has not forgiven Jeremi\u0107 for his opposition to Kosovan independence, amid its perception that he used his time as president of the general assembly as a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/03/25/unga-presidents-serbian-nationalism-rankles-western-powers/\">platform for nationalist rhetoric</a>.</p> <p>The threat of vetoes, however, will only become decisive in the next round, when the permanent five will cast coloured ballots.

In the latest poll, the first three spots were taken by men. </p> <p>Helen Clark, the former New Zealand prime minister and head of the UN Development Programme, is one of several highly qualified women in the race who did far worse than expected in the polls, but she played down the role of sexism. </p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re asking whether women are being discriminated against \u2013 no,\u201d Clark told the Guardian. \u201cThere are a lot of factors swirling around. There is east-west, there is north-south, there\u2019s the style of what\u2019s wanted in the job. Do they want strong leadership? Do they want malleable?

But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the whole story. Power politics matters more.

The ups and downs of the straw polls are an outward sign of what is going on behind closed doors but do not tell the whole story. The most consequential rivalry in the race this week, for example, will be played out thousands of miles from UN headquarters, in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia.</p> <p>After Bulgaria\u2019s official nominee, Irina Bokova, the head of the UN education and culture organisation, Unesco, performed below expectations in the security council ballots, a behind-the-scenes campaign began to replace her with her fellow countrywoman, Kristalina Georgieva, the EU budget commissioner, who was defeated in the initial struggle to win the nomination. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/16/my-replacement-should-be-a-woman-says-un-secretary-general\">My replacement should be a woman, says UN secretary general</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The appearance of a series of articles attacking Bokova, in the British press and elsewhere, led Bokova to complain of <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/bokova-deplores-undignified-campaign-against-her-un-bid/\">an \u201cundignified\u201d smear campaign</a>.

A fortnight ago, government officials briefed journalists in Sofia that Borisov was about to swing his support behind Georgieva. However, soon afterwards he changed his mind and said he <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/bulgaria-mulls-kristalina-georgieva-for-un-post-ban-ki-moon-secretary-general/\">would wait to see</a> how Bokova did in the fifth ballot on Monday before making up his mind. </p> <p>Since then, Russian officials have been canvassing votes for Bokova as a way of keeping Georgieva out of the race. </p> <p>\u201cIf Russia can get her to 10 \u2018encourages\u2019 it would be hard for Borisov to defenestrate her. If she stays at seven or eight, she is not safe,\u201d said Richard Gowan, an expert on the UN at the European Council for Foreign Relations. </p> <p>Even if Georgieva did make a late entrance into the race, she could still face a veto from Russia. She is after all a member of a European commission, currently enforcing sanctions on Moscow. </p> <p>The permanent five\u2019s potential vetoes in the secretary general contest are bargaining chips on a table on which rivalry in Syria, Ukraine and other conflicts is being brokered. The poisonous atmosphere in the council could make for a protracted struggle to which the most qualified candidates fall victim, opening the way for a more obscure contender. </p> <p>Alternatively, Gowan argues, the permanent five might momentarily bury their differences to protect their shared privilege, as failure to do so would open the way for the wider UN membership in the general assembly to play a greater role in resolving security council deadlock.</p> <p>\u201cFor all the geopolitical difference, the logic of P5 control means they could still do a deal. The P5 is a little unnerved by how much all the transparency stuff has shaped the contest,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir view is that the general assembly has had its fun and should now get back in its box.\u201d</p> <p>The cross currents of geopolitical struggle and Balkan political intrigue, mean that nothing is decided until the last moment. For that reason, candidates with indifferent results in past ballots are staying in the race, at least until the coloured ballots in October.</p> <p>\u201cThe band\u2019s still playing,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAnything can come out of this.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 September 2016 to make clear that Vuk Jeremi\u0107 is no longer the Serbian foreign minister.</p>",

Last year in France, his Versailles Garden public art show, Dirty Corner, was dubbed \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Vagina\u201d \u2013 and landed him in court.</p> <p>\u201cThat became hugely controversial, I still don\u2019t know why,\u201d he says. \u201cIt seemed to offend people for reasons I can\u2019t understand.\u201d</p> <p> The work was defaced with anti-Semitic graffiti, which Kapoor refused to remove to make a statement on \u201chumanity\u2019s intolerance\u201d \u2013 a decision that saw him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/sep/10/anish-kapoor-sued-racist-graffiti-versailles-sculpture-queens-vagina\">sued by a Versailles politician</a>. The sculpture (and graffiti) was later covered in gold leaf.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/sep/10/anish-kapoor-sued-racist-graffiti-versailles-sculpture-queens-vagina\">Anish Kapoor sued for leaving racist graffiti on his 'queen's vagina' sculpture at Versailles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that the work got sexualised,\u201d Kapoor says. \u201cOur cities are full of masculine objects. No one makes the slightest noise about another phallus on the horizon but it seems a vagina is really a problem.\u201d</p> <p>Kapoor says the response to the work says more about the people than his own artistic intentions. </p> <p>\u201cAll I ever did in an interview was use the word \u2018she\u2019 \u2013 I didn\u2019t use the word \u2018vagina\u2019. I said, \u2018She sits here in on the lawn\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting [that], when it got named as a feminine sexual object, all the hate came out \u2013 real hate. So I decided to leave it there.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t make art for other people. You can\u2019t make art for an audience \u2013 the work has to live the story of itself in a way.\u201d<br></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.kukjegallery.com/KJ_exhibitions_view_1.php?ex_no=195&amp;v=1/\">Anish Kapoor: Gathering Clouds</a> is on view at Kukje Gallery, Jongno-gu, Seoul, until 30 October </em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 September 2016. An earlier version incorrectly stated that Kapoor had used Vantablack in a public artwork. It also referred to Kapoor as an \u201carchitect and artist\u201d; he has completed architectural projects, but is not trained as an architect.</p>"
