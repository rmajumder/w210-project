  "<p>Two of the highest-level global summits ever convened on refugees and mass migration take place in New York this week: one by the United Nations and the other by the White House. This should be the reform moment when the world comes together to update a broken system that is struggling to meet contemporary displacement challenges. But a combination of inter-agency turf wars and government foot-dragging make this unlikely.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/17/world-will-not-face-up-to-refugee-crisis-un-obama\">Why won\u2019t the world tackle the refugee crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tomorrow\u2019s UN meeting will focus more on abstract principles of commitment than concrete practice. A conference originally conceived with the intention of addressing the situation of Syrian refugees and the Mediterranean morphed into a negotiation of two \u201cGlobal Compacts\u201d: one on refugees and one on migration. But even these have collapsed in negotiations, such that the final declaration now reveals only vague principles, denuded of substance by spoiler governments.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s Obama-led Leaders\u2019 Summit is about pledging. Unable to elicit additional resettlement places from Congress, the administration has focused on playing an international convening goal. It has sought commitments in three areas: additional humanitarian assistance, more resettlement places, and a focus on jobs and education. But with states experiencing donor fatigue, significant new pledges seem improbable.</p> <p>The tragedy is that these meetings have become irresponsibly removed from the real challenges on the ground. They will do little to directly address systematic non-compliance with refugee law in Europe or Australia, to ensure that refugees stuck in camps are not indefinitely trapped in limbo, to address the plight of millions of urban refugees, or to define a response to the millions of people who will be displaced by factors such as climate change that fall outside the existing refugee framework.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Today people are mainly fleeing fragile states characterised by mass violence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The summits have largely bypassed the biggest and most urgent questions relating to institutional reform. There is widespread acknowledgement that the system is broken and yet no appetite to fix it. In 1971 the international monetary system reached its crisis moment and reformed; 2016 should be that moment for refugees. Change is needed because the refugee system was created in the early cold war largely to meet US interests in avoiding the return of displaced Germans to the communist bloc. And yet, in a radically changed world, this time-warped framework is still expected to apply.</p> <p>The basic idea in the 1951 Refugee Convention \u2013 that refugees should not be returned to serious harm \u2013 remains as relevant today as ever. However, its focus on refugees as people fleeing \u201cpersecution\u201d has become antiquated. Today people are mainly fleeing fragile states characterised by mass violence. While courts have sometimes managed to shoehorn contemporary displacement into outdated language, the result is arbitrary exclusions and erratic responses: in 2014 recognition rates for Eritrean asylum seekers ranged from 26% in France to 100% in Sweden. Meanwhile for many years Germany would not recognise Somali refugees because the harm they experienced was from non-state actors rather than a persecuting government.</p> <p>Organisational reform is also off the table. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) does what it does very well: humanitarian aid and camp management, and legal advice to states. But these are no longer the primary things a UN refugee agency needs to be doing. The tools needed today are political engagement, development and economics, and the ability to work in urban environments. The disjuncture is exemplified by the stark reality that the overwhelming majority of Syrian refugees receive no assistance whatsoever from UNHCR or its partners. A UN refugee agency remains indispensable but donor states should be asking for an updated model.</p> <p>On the ground, the default model is one of humanitarian assistance in camps. But too many refugees in camps get stuck there for decades, where they usually have no right to work. 56% of the world\u2019s refugees are in protracted situations, having been in exile for at least 5 years. Refuge needs to be reconceived as at least as much about development as about humanitarianism. It needs to offer jobs and education to the nearly 90% of the world\u2019s refugees who are in developing countries, including the majority who are now in cities.</p> <p>Tragically, a vision for legal, organisational and operational reform will not feature on the agenda this week. Addressing these issues is the key to finding sustainable solutions not only to the Syrian crisis but also inevitable future movements.</p> <p>But there may still be hope. In order to save face, the UN conveners will now use 19 September to launch an ongoing two-year intergovernmental process. At the margins of the formal meetings, governments, businesses and civil society have mobilised to launch a range of exciting initiatives. These pathways may still leave the door ajar for meaningful change.</p> <p><em>Alexander Betts is director of the Refugee Studies Centre at the University of Oxford.

  "<p>Under prevailing theories of economic voting, \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d should not be a good slogan for a time when poverty and unemployment are falling, and household income is rising, as the latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/household-income-increase-poverty-us-census-report\">Census report</a> shows. The fact that Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/donald-trump-pretend-populist-economic-policy-plan-estate-tax-high-income-bracket\">faux-populist</a> appeal resonates at all despite this should be evidence enough that it\u2019s not about the economy. In any case, Trump\u2019s more explicit promises about walls and religious tests should make it clear what American greatness really means to him.</p> <p>Yet there are many who take Trump\u2019s claims to an economic populist mantle seriously, including some on the left. So eager are they to find any evidence at all of a burgeoning American class consciousness that they project it onto an unlikely source, one who spends more on hair transplants than most Americans make in a year. </p> <p>The argument, made by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/07/donald-trump-why-americans-support\">Frank</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/how-america-made-donald-trump-unstoppable-20160224\">Taibbi</a>, <a href=\"http://michaelmoore.com/trumpwillwin/\">Moore</a>, and others goes roughly like this: trade is a huge issue ignored by Washington elites. Trump supporters are those who have been economically left behind, particularly by trade. Liberals who say it\u2019s about racism and nativism have their heads in the sand. Trump supporters are simply voting their class interests. This is why Trump will win.</p> <p>I don\u2019t believe any of these things are true. For better or worse, trade is not a major issue in American politics. Neither American voters generally nor Trump voters specifically rank it among their top concerns: only <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/07/19/this-one-survey-shows-why-trump-wont-win-over-sanders-supporters/\">36% of Trump supporters</a> polled said trade was a critical issue to them, well behind terrorism and immigration. Trump supporters are not, overall, economically worse off. A <a href=\"http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=152013104065027077080085071031017102101074051042007060126089031090122097127005079073055020029097121126020121094005109112006086059016075034036069001020105021125087080067045021075124026002079003071084070121024106117127123112081119094073124112082105125073&amp;EXT=pdf\">Gallup study</a> found Trump supporters have higher median incomes than non-Trump supporters, and are no more likely to live in areas affected by trade. Curiously, wealthy Trump supporters report feeling the same level of economic anxiety as poor non-Trump supporters \u2013 which is to say, they think they\u2019re doing worse than they are. This is probably because, as political scientist <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/08/22/economic-anxiety-isnt-driving-racial-resentment-racial-resentment-is-driving-economic-anxiety/\">Michael Tesler</a>\u2019s research shows, voters\u2019 perceptions of how the economy is doing have a lot more to do with their party identities, and attitudes on race, than how the economy is actually doing.</p> <p>And when you <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/6/2/11833548/donald-trump-support-race-religion-economy\">test</a> economic v racial issues against each other as predictors of Trump support, the significance of the economic ones disappears. It isn\u2019t about trade, it isn\u2019t about jobs, it isn\u2019t about economic performance. It\u2019s about demographics, and the sense that the country is looking less and less like what a portion of the electorate imagines it should look like \u2013 a perception that is also exaggerated, since Trump supporters are also no more likely to live in areas affected by immigration.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear what this does not mean: it does not mean that Trump supporters are all cross-burning racists. It does not mean that racial resentment is exclusive to Trump supporters; <a href=\"http://www.telesurtv.net/english/opinion/Bernie-Sanders-Lifting-up-the-Masses-or-the-Few--20160331-0068.html\">Daniel Byrd and Loren Collingwood</a> found some (though not as many) of Clinton and Sanders supporters reported similar attitudes. It does not mean \u201cAmerica is already great\u201d or that working class Americans haven\u2019t been left behind. It does not mean that there are not many people who support Trump because they feel (real or imagined) economic stress. It means that for every person who votes for Trump because they feel economic stress, there is another person who votes for Clinton for the same reason. If all you know about someone is how hard they were hit by the recession, you\u2019re no more likely to predict their vote than a coin toss. But if all you know about them is how they feel about black people and Muslims, you can make a pretty good guess.</p> <p>So why the credulity on the part of some pundits? It may be a suspicion of polling evidence left over from the primaries (remember, the polls didn\u2019t get Trump wrong, the polling analysts just ignored them), or part of a broader, leftists v liberals culture war over identity politics. Those to the left of the Democrats have been pushing back on what they see as a disproportionate focus by liberals on race, gender, and sexual identity to the detriment of economics. And in this election, there is a justifiable sense that efforts to caricature Trump supporters as Klansmen is an easy way for Democrats to excuse their neglect of their working class base. But replacing that caricature with a new one, that of saintly, if slightly confused, characters from a Steinbeck novel, has even less basis in reality. It\u2019s one thing to say that Americans should vote their class interests more. It\u2019s another to say they do. One is a valid normative argument (which I agree with), another is observably false.</p> <p>Americans have never truly voted along class lines; a working class vote divided by racial issues is not the exception in American politics but the rule. But Trump has a lot of people confusing what is with what ought to be. A better case can be made for a pro-worker platform than fixed ideas about Trump voters. Politicians should cater to working class interests more not because there is, or ever has been, such thing as a unified working class vote, but because it\u2019s the right thing to do.</p>",
  "<p>One recent Saturday morning, a friend who was staying with me for the weekend looked frightened as he walked into my living room minutes after waking up. As he sat down in a chair, he told me about the nightmare he\u2019d just had: he was walking through Chicago and somebody shot him, for no reason.<br></p> <p>No reason, perhaps, but it\u2019s not an irrational fear for a young black man, as we both are. This year has been one of the city\u2019s deadliest in decades, with seemingly unending gun violence that already has taken over 500 lives (already outpacing last year\u2019s 481) and only continues to climb as the city has surpassed <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-chicago-violence-shootings-3000-20160912-story.html\">3,000 shootings just this year </a>\u2013 a 47% increase compared to this time last year.</p> <p>In all my years in Chicago, I\u2019ve only heard gunshots while crime reporting on the south or west sides of the city, never in the neighborhoods where I have lived, which are all on the north side and are considered \u201cwhite\u201d neighborhoods. Due to the south side having <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/the-racist-housing-policy-that-made-your-neighborhood/371439/\">a long history of redlining and housing discrimination</a>, the city has become one of the most segregated places in the US \u2013 and thus the violence has been largely isolated.</p> <p>With this in mind, I reassured my friend by telling him shootings don\u2019t happen here: that didn\u2019t happen here. By weekend\u2019s end, he safely went back home to Indiana.</p> <p>The following Monday, a south side Chicago police officer found himself grieving the death of his son, Arshell Dennis III, after he was shot dead before returning to college in New York this fall. </p> <p>Eight other victims were killed that weekend in addition to the 54 non-fatal shootings, including a six-year-old girl slain while playing on the sidewalk in a South Side neighborhood. All victims were black.</p> <p>Later that week, I saw that <a href=\"https://pics.onsizzle.com/austin-belmont-cra-gin-crime-mayhem-9-people-3295726.png\">a meme had emerged</a> on Facebook contrasting yet another violent weekend with another pressing matter miles away, on the other side of town.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b2141d0b6d543b2467a31710cc002565e72cb3d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2141d0b6d543b2467a31710cc002565e72cb3d2/0_0_500_610/410.png\" alt=\"austin-belmont-cra-gin-crime-mayhem-9-people-3295726\" width=\"410\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Over the past year, residents of the upscale north side neighborhood of Gold Coast, an area close to where I live, have been<a href=\"https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150701/gold-coast/mariano-park-suitors-pitch-feisty-gold-coast-crowd\"> divided and even protesting</a> over the question of which business would get the franchise for a historic cafe in a the popular Mariano Park. </p> <p>After months of community meetings, a local coffee shop won the bid and opened for business in time for this summer. But the locals were far from happy: they began complaining to local media that the gelato vendor that the cafe brought with them, Black Dog, <a href=\"https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20160815/gold-coast/gold-coast-gelato-wars-some-residents-say-deserve-better-dessert\">was not good enough</a>. Residents began collecting signatures for a petition to replace the vendor. It was an impressive effort of community activism.</p> <p>As these two news stories unfolded through social media that week, I allowed myself a rueful smile. Not because any of it was actually funny, but at the sad absurdity of a city where two worlds can co-exist yet never intersect, and where the quality of gelato in park cafe can be as pressing a concern as the constant toll of gun death among black people.</p> <p>Local police and even the mayor continually point to gangs as the cause, but a number of activists and community members argue that blaming it on gangs doesn\u2019t speak to larger issues at play: segregation, poverty and lack of social mobility.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you remove resources, economic opportunities, don\u2019t invest in education, create a difficult route to obtain quality housing, remove black leadership by mass incarceration, it creates a formula for disaster,\u201d said activist William Calloway, who worked to releasing the infamous <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-laquan-mcdonald-police-dashboard-short-video-premiumvideo.html\">Laquan McDonald dashboard camera footage</a>.</p> <p>The same community has to fight the incredible closure of <a href=\"http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/repurposing-cps-schools-closure-vacant/Content?oid=23462075\">over 50 public schools</a>, has to fight for <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/13/chicago-mental-health-protests_n_1591449.html\">mental health clinics to be re-opened</a>, and has to fight for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/08/obama-library-university-chicago-trauma-center-protests\">Level 1 trauma center</a> instead of a presidential library (the south side has been without one for decades). To make matters worse, <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-youth-unemployment-urban-league-0126-biz-20160124-story.html\">half of young black men</a> in Chicago are out of a job. </p> <p>Activists constantly argue its the disappearance of resources that needs emergency response in order to curb violence. But instead, the city rolls out programs such as the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/undeclared-war-chicago-grapples-with-historic-gun-violence/\">\u201cstrategic subject list\u201d</a>, a predictive tactic to identify those who will be repeated offenders connected to gun violence. </p> <p>When looking at maps of the shootings, one can overlay them with maps of census tract data on ethnicity and economic status and see a direct correlation: white areas don\u2019t see as many shootings, while black and Latino areas see <a href=\"http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2012/07/26/concentrated-poverty-and-homicide-in-chicago\">the majority of them and are also poorer</a>. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The poverty [we face], divestment, over-policing, police terror exist outside the experiences of the city\u2019s  privileged</p> <footer> <cite>Aislinn Sol</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Aislinn Sol, a leader of the local Black Lives Matter movement, told me \u201cthe extreme poverty [we face], divestment, over-policing, police terror exist outside the experiences of the city\u2019s wealthy, privileged and white constituents,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is an issue of extreme privilege to not be bothered by the rampant violence that is a direct result of disinvestment in our communities.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the north side, I\u2019ve seen first hand how little people think about the gun crisis unfolding at their doorstep. When they watch the evening news, the tragedy that is everyday life in black and brown parts of the city seems like it is happening in a far-off land. It\u2019s <em>there</em>, not <em>here</em>.</p> <p>In many ways, I benefit from this privilege even as a black person, because I am able to live <em>here</em>, in a \u201cwhite\u201d neighborhood. But I\u2019ve also had drunken north-siders tell me and my friends to \u201cgo back to your side of town\u201d. Once, I even encountered a group of white men in baseball jerseys who yelled \u201cObama nigger-monkey\u201d at me. </p> <p>All I was doing was walking to the bakery.</p> <p>Another time, I hosted a brunch for a group of black gay men. My white neighbors decided they didn\u2019t like seeing \u201cporch monkeys\u201d on my deck and lit their grill underneath it. As smoke from the fire began to billow up, they shouted racist and homophobic epithets. Later that week, these same neighbors told another resident that the \u201ccolored boys\u201d were ruining their community.</p> <p>Yes, there were also friends and sympathetic neighbors who, hearing about the incident, reached out immediately. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that happened here,\u201d they said, again and again. But of course it would happen here. This is how the neighborhood policing of segregation works, and why the solution for violence across town isn\u2019t to just move: because there will always be a hurdle for people of color to obtain the same privileges as the ones white people enjoy, no matter where we live.</p> <p>As long as the north side can remain unbothered by gun violence, people on my side of town will continue to nonchalantly go on about their lives. They\u2019ll carry on worrying about gelato, not black lives. Those just aren\u2019t sweet enough. </p>",
  "<p>Where did the US get the uranium it needed to build the atom bombs it dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki? From a mine somewhere in the US? In Canada? My guess is that not many people know, or have even asked. The answer lies deep in the heart of Africa. It was extracted from the Shinkolobwe mine in then Belgian Congo, owned by Union Mini\u00e8re, part of the mother country\u2019s biggest and wealthiest company, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique. Without access to that mine, the atom bomb might never have been built by American scientists during the second world war.</p> <p>Susan Williams\u2019s last book, <em>Who Killed Hammarskj\u00f6ld?</em>, prompted the UN to set up a new inquiry into<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/14/un-inquiry-1961-dag-hammarskjold-air-crash\"> the death \u2013 in a plane crash in Northern Rhodesia \u2013 of its former secretary general</a>. Her new, meticulously researched book has shades of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/grahamgreene\">Graham Greene</a>, a hint of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/josephconrad\">Conrad</a>, even echoes of <em>Indiana Jones</em>.</p> <p>Using newly opened archives and personal interviews, she describes how the American <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/intelligence-history/oss/art03.htm\">Office of Strategic Services</a> (OSS) \u2013 forerunner of the CIA \u2013 recruited a motley band to ensure the uranium reached the US and did not fall into the hands of Nazi Germany. The group of hand-picked officers included two ornithologists \u2013 good training, perhaps, for a spy. They posed as rubber prospectors or investigators of diamond smugglers. The word \u201curanium\u201d never passed their lips: instead, even in coded telegrams, they referred to \u201craw material\u201d, \u201cdiamonds\u201d, or, simply, \u201cgems\u201d.They were not told why the US was so desperate to secure a regular supply of the high-grade uranium ore. Not even Wilbur Owings Hogue, the OSS station chief in Belgian Congo, described by Williams as \u201ca very clever civil engineer with a self-deprecating sense of humour\u201d, was told.</p> <p>Their task was made more difficult and dangerous by pro-German sentiments among some of the Belgian industrialists and colonists in the Congo. Union Mini\u00e8re had already sold significant amounts of uranium ore to Germany. (Williams points to what was happening in Belgium itself, where businesses were dealing with their German occupiers: in 1943 alone, Belgian firms delivered 155 locomotives to Germany.) However, the US had a key ally in <a href=\"http://www.atomicheritage.org/profile/edgar-sengier\">Edgar Sengier</a>, head of Union Mini\u00e8re\u2019s New York-based operations, who after the war was awarded the medal for merit, which was then the US government\u2019s highest civilian award.</p> <p>In Congo, many businessmen were waiting to see who looked like winning the war before committing themselves to the Allies. Senior Belgian officials were themselves involved in diamond smuggling, sometimes in Red Cross parcels, for their personal benefit. There were always doubts about their loyalties; few could be trusted. Using diamond smuggling as cover for their true role remained a potentially fatal strategy for OSS officers. Hogue\u2019s life was threatened more than once, as a result of leaks from a Belgian journalist he recruited as an informer.</p> <p>Williams contrasts the luxurious living of Congo\u2019s white inhabitants with the brutal treatment of the black population. She describes how, on his first day there, a US code officer was faced with the sight of a Congolese man in ragged shorts, kneeling on the ground, with a Belgian official standing over him with a <em>chicotte</em> \u2013 a whip made of leather thongs with a metal end. \u201cEvery lash was followed by a scream of agony,\u201d the US officer recorded. \u201cWhen the prescribed number of lashes had been delivered, the black\u2019s skin from neck to waist was a mass of blood with ribs shining through.\u201d The officer was told it was punishment for stealing a packet of cigarettes from a Belgian.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The moral authority of the struggle against fascism was not applied to the inequalities and injustice in the Congo</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Soon after the end of the war, in November 1945, strikers protesting at terrible living and working conditions in L\u00e9opoldville (now Kinshasa, capital of Democratic Republic of the Congo) and the port of Matadi (through which much of the uranium was shipped) were killed along with women and children. \u201cThe moral authority of the struggle against fascism was not applied to the inequalities and injustice in the Congo,\u201d Williams writes. Workers at the Shinkolobwe mine were not protected at all from radiation.</p> <p>If I have a quibble about <em>Spies in the Congo</em> it is that, on occasion, dense \u2013 albeit rich \u2013 detail slows down the pace of what is truly a thriller, in which Williams paints clear and sympathetic pictures of characters thrust into a totally unfamiliar territory.</p> <p>She opens her book with a letter Albert Einstein wrote to President Roosevelt on 2 August 1939, alerting him to the possibility of constructing a powerful bomb turning uranium into a new and important source of energy. \u201cThe most important source of uranium is Belgian Congo,\u201d Einstein wrote.</p> <p>There is another terrible legacy, aside from the bombs dropped on Japan, at the source of that uranium. Radioactive waste at Shinkolobwe has led to birth defects and cancers. After the collapse of a mineshaft, the UN asked the International Atomic Energy Agency to <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=412&amp;ArticleID=4661&amp;l=en\">investigate conditions there</a>. Its study found that 6,000 small-scale miners had been digging for coltan and cobalt: everyone working there was at risk of developing health problems because of high levels of radiation.</p> <p>\u201cShinkolobwe has never been commemorated,\u201d the Congolese journalist Oliver Tshinyoka noted last year \u2013 the 70th anniversary of the atom bomb attacks on Japan.

  "<p>In trying to categorise a new arrival in the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/101143/mean.girls\"><em>Mean Girls</em></a> one character asks: \u201cif you\u2019re from Africa, how come you\u2019re white?\u201d The mean girl cannot have been paying attention in class, because, as Adam Rutherford reminds us so elegantly in his latest book, we are all African \u2013 originally. The only homo sapiens on the planet 100,000 years ago were in Africa.</p> <p>The mean girl can be forgiven her ignorance, since the way many of us (lay people and professionals alike) have been taught about our origins is flawed. The neat family trees and branch lines charting the steady progress of evolution, and those ubiquitous illustrations of the ascent of humans, in which we evolve step by step from bent-over apes to straight-backed homo sapiens, are not just simplistic, they are a profound misshaping of the truth.</p> <p>If you take the notion that you have two parents, that they each also had two parents, and work backwards to an ever expanding family tree, then by the time you reach the eighth century and Charlemagne you will have accounted for 137,438,953,472 individuals, more people than have ever existed in total on the planet. Family trees, it seems, collapse and fold in; they zigzag across generations to produce a bewilderingly entangled mesh.</p> <p>In untangling this mesh, Rutherford aims at no less than a retelling of human history. Imagine if Edward Gibbon\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire.html\"><em>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em></a> were updated with the addendum \u201cas told by genes\u201d and you\u2019d get a sense of the scale of the ambition. But then a writer who suggests his book is a continuation of Steve Jones\u2019s masterpiece <em>The Language of Genes</em> is clearly not short of confidence.</p> <p>Rutherford\u2019s follow-up to his highly regarded first book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/creation.html\"><em>Creation</em></a> is an effervescent work, brimming with tales and confounding ideas carried in the \u201cepic poem in our cells\u201d. The myriad storylines will leave you swooning. A random sample includes: why the distribution of wet and dry ear wax in humans suggests that the people of South Korea might be the least smelly on earth; why the idea of a Danish Viking conquest of the British Isles involving rape and pillage is not borne out by a genetic legacy; and why monoamine oxidase A, the so-called \u201cwarrior gene\u201d, ought not to be a valid defence in criminal trials.</p> <p>In the first half of the book, Rutherford charts how we came to be. The \u201cOut of Africa\u201d argument is alive and well, but it\u2019s complicated. \u201cThe dates and overall flow has profoundly changed with evidence provided by ancient DNA.\u201d In their great migrations homo sapiens were both \u201cmobile and horny\u201d. A toe bone of a female Neanderthal who died 50,000 years ago in the Siberian Altai mountains exposes ancient humans\u2019 inclination to mate with other species. Denisovans from the nearby Denisova caves also contributed to the modern human gene pool.</p> <p>The second half explores the trickier question of who we are now, and the profound consequences of the extraordinary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/human-genome-project\">Human Genome Project</a> (HGP) \u2013 the sequencing of the 20,000 genes, spread across 23 pairs of chromosomes comprised of 3bn letters of genetic code that contain the instructions that make us human.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afaa59a629b505e8afe7fe30e2baa22fd35167a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afaa59a629b505e8afe7fe30e2baa22fd35167a0/0_1126_3550_2130/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Computer-generated model of a DNA molecule.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Computer-generated model of a DNA molecule.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Collection Mix: Subjects</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rutherford, a trained geneticist, is an enthusiastic guide. He is especially illuminating on the nebulous concept of race, how it both does and doesn\u2019t exist. In 1972 an academic paper asserted that there was more genetic difference within so-called races than there was between them. A black Jamaican can be more closely linked genetically to a white Englishman than to a black Nigerian. It all depends what you select for. In trying to group people, if for instance you select for adaptation to altitude, then genetically you\u2019ll find a connection between Nepalese and Ethiopians.</p> <p>Science, Rutherford reminds us, is a work in progress. Pillars of certainty from my 1980s medical school textbooks come crashing down as he uncouples diseases from groups of people with whom they were previously associated. In \u201cgenome-wide association studies\u201d researchers take a sample of people with a particular condition and look for variants in changes to DNA that are not found in people who don\u2019t have the condition. <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Tay-Sachs-disease/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">Tay-Sachs disease, long regarded as a \u201cJewish condition\u201d, isn\u2019t any more. As Rutherford points out, with \u201ccareful genetic counselling\u201d it has all but vanished among Ashkenazi Jewish populations.</a> DNA analysis shows how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/sickle-cell-disease\">sickle cell</a> trait (resulting from one copy of a mutated gene haemoglobin-B distorting the red blood cell to a sickle shape), once identified with sub-Saharan Africans and their more immediate new world descendants, is actually also found in the Middle East, the Philippines and southern Europe.</p> <p>That example allows Rutherford to demonstrate how evolution can give with one hand and take away with the other. Sickle cell trait evolved to give protection against malaria (specifically from the parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax) whereas the full-blown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/sickle-cell-disease\">sickle cell disease</a> (with two copies of the gene) is a serious, sometimes life-threatening condition.</p> <p>The pursuit of genetic science has often been a noble and selfless adventure. But skirting around the margins of this book is an intriguing and underexplored question: if the science of genetics strives for perfection, does it matter that its practitioners are flawed? Francis Galton was the founder of eugenics. Does the fact that he was also a gentleman scientist with innovative taxonomical ideas make his assertions about race any less odious? While Rutherford is no apologist for Galton, he goes some way towards rescuing him from his racism by acknowledging his pioneering research into identical twins, which led to the question that still haunts us today about the relative importance of society and inheritance in shaping human development (the phrase \u201cnature v nurture\u201d was coined by Galton).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rutherford argues that rather than halting the advance of gene science, we all need to\u00a0have our genomes sequenced</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Galton\u2019s keen commercial instincts about human self-curiosity were evident at the International Health Exhibition in 1884 when he set up an anthropomorphic laboratory. For threepence, punters were tested with biometric tools including devices to measure the head and nose, to be presented with a record of their chief physical characteristics. Rutherford sees modern equivalents in the DNA companies who exploit our thirst for definitive statements of our past and likely futures. Too often, he suggests, DNA ancestry tests should come with the warning caveat: the science of genetics is probabilistic. Rutherford politely skewers the fantastical reports made by companies who claim with GPS accuracy to be able to locate the village in which your ancestors lived.</p> <p>The Human Genome Project, with endorsements from figures such as the former US president Bill Clinton, who believed we were \u201clearning the language in which God created life\u201d, has fuelled limitless public expectations. In the years since its publication in 2001 there has been an escalation in the level of carping over its supposed underachievement. Rutherford acknowledges that the HGP has yet to yield a cure for a disease or its eradication. But in his reading, genetic science appears under siege from a ragtag cabal of journalists (cynical and gullible), heretical populist doctors, and new age gurus and their vociferous followers, who question the value and expense of the research. Riding to the defence of his colleagues in science, Rutherford argues with admirable and passionate intensity that rather than halting the advance of gene science, we all need to have our genomes sequenced.</p> <p>Above the swing doors of the dissection room of my 1980s medical school some wag once scrawled \u201cBehold Man!\u201d The dissection of cadavers with scissors and scalpels was a \u201cnecessary inhumanity\u201d; the tracing of nerves, muscles and collapsed blood vessels did not just offer up the secrets of anatomy but opened a window into what it is to be human. The HGP with its much greater powers of resolution not only affords us a chance to behold man at a molecular level but provides a vision of a past that needs necessarily to be rewritten. Rutherford has proved himself a commendable historian \u2013 one who is determined to illuminate the commonality of Homo sapiens. So much so that by the end of <em>A Brief History</em> I was reminded of the aptness of the Jamaican motto: \u201cOut of Many, One People\u201d.

  "<p>Everyone knows that Snow White \u2013 paragon of purity, beauty, youth \u2013 is hunted down by her wicked stepmother. Or is she? In the first 1812 edition of the Brothers Grimm tale, it is not her stepmother who orders the huntsman to cut out the girl\u2019s lungs and liver to eat, but her own mother.</p> <p>That small but crucial twist has now been resurrected. Forget Disney; a new rock-opera-cum-cabaret by La Boite Theatre Company, Opera Queensland, and Brisbane Festival dives into a far more grown-up, gory version of the fairytale. With the dwarves and the prince jettisoned in favour of competitive mother-daughter relations, this production hones in on the rabid jealousy that can arise between those bound by blood.</p> <p>The Queen (Italian opera singer Silvia Colloca) is a raven-haired autocrat in love with her own reflection. She dances the tango with the slick, servile Mirror (Kanen Breen), whose camp, catty remarks are enhanced by his black suit, bleached hair, and sparkling ruby lipstick. The Queen rules by looks: female power, for her, is bound up with being a bombshell.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2016/jan/31/snow-white-and-the-seven-lines-has-disney-got-a-princess-problem\">Snow White and the seven lines: has Disney got a princess problem?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then, one day, 15-year-old Snow White secretly tries on her mother\u2019s clothes. She kicks off her ugly black school loafers and gingerly slips one foot at a time into red stilettos. Over her white smock she wraps a regal gown. Encouraged by the crooning Mirror, Snow White preens and pouts. When it dawns on the Queen that her sexual prowess is about to be usurped, she orders her daughter killed. (In the Brothers Grimm version she literally desires to consume her daughter by eating her innards.)</p> <p>La Boite\u2019s Snow White is just one of a number of revivals at this year\u2019s Brisbane Festival. Together they paint a complex picture of the fairytale popularised by the Brothers Grimm in the early 19th century.</p> <p>This Sunday will see a <a href=\"http://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/whats-on/snow-white-1916\">rare screening of the 1916 silent film Snow White</a>, enhanced with live music from concert pianist Mauro Colombis. Walt Disney watched this fantasy caper as a boy. It inspired him to make his animated masterpiece Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (<a href=\"http://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/whats-on/snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs-1937\">also showing on Sunday at Goma</a>) in 1937, replete with singing little people, cute woodland animals, and a handsome, if utterly insipid, prince. Years later he proclaimed it to be the \u201cperfect story\u201d.</p> <p>But if Disney delivered a sanitised, sugary take on a tale that has its roots in a brutal, violent Europe, the French Snow White by Ballet Preljocaj, which <a href=\"http://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/whats-on/snow-white-ballet-preljocaj\">finished its run last week</a>, is more faithful to the darker tones of the original (the festival states this production is not recommended for children). With costumes designed by Jean Paul Gaultier, the wicked queen is a bondage dominatrix surrounded by prowling cats. Her punishment, as in Brothers Grimm, is a dance to the death in hot iron shoes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"816f42640d36da0f6fe41a92099c2f23ab328406\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/816f42640d36da0f6fe41a92099c2f23ab328406/0_800_3200_4000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Emilie Lalande as Snow White in Snow White - Ballet Preljocaj at QPAC at the 2016 Brisbane Festival\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emilie Lalande in Snow White by Ballet Preljocaj at 2016 Brisbane Festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Thomas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Liberties, however, are taken with Snow White. In the Grimm tale she is named \u201cLittle Snow White\u201d to emphasise her childish innocence. Upon her collapse from the poison apple, she is encased in a glass coffin; it is there, when she is little more than a lifeless porcelain doll, where the prince first sees and claims her. \u201cLet me have the coffin,\u201d he says to the mourning dwarfs. \u201cI will give you anything you want for it.\u201d</p> <p>Thankfully, Ballet Preljocaj provides Snow White with more agency. Danced by Emilie Lalande, she is not a comatose object to be possessed and traded by men, but a flirtatious tease, awake and aware (for the most part at least; after the queen shoves the apple down her throat, she becomes lifeless, her limbs animated by the devastated prince). While the rest of the dancers\u2019 movements are staccato, hers are languid and fluid, brimming with eroticism.</p> <p>In her 1971 book Transformations Pulitzer prize-winning poet Anne Sexton dubbed Snow White a \u201cdumb bunny\u201d: in the original tale, after all, she is tricked not once but three times by the wicked queen. La Boite\u2019s Snow White (played by the perfectly pitched Stephanie Pickett) is also a bunny but more of the Playboy variety.</p> <p>Like her mother \u2013 who convinces the horny, hunky Huntsman (Michael Tuahine) to kill her daughter by seducing him \u2013 Snow White quickly learns that sex is power. When the Huntsman is sent to execute her, she shows him what he\u2019s missing. This Snow White is no wilting violet or chirpy domestic busybody as in Disney\u2019s take. Nor is she like Kristen Stewart\u2019s \u201cwarrior princess\u201d, who took up arms to reclaim her kingdom in the 2012 film Snow White and the Huntsman. This Snow White is really only interested in saving herself.</p> <p>In The New Yorker, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/snow-white-beauty-is-power\">folklore scholar Maria Tatar writes</a> that early renditions of Snow White are \u201ca reflection on children\u2019s fears about the cruelty of stepmothers, at a time when mortality rates for child-bearing women were exceptionally high.\u201d That may be true. The Brothers Grimm revised their earliest version, changing the murderous mother to a murderous stepmother in the 1819 edition, possibly to lessen the impact and implications of the former.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/04/from-snow-white-to-cinderella-story-fairytales-film\">From Snow White to Cinderella, the story of fairytales on film</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Playing with the taboo idea of an evil mother is more interesting today, when stepmothers have less control over children and it is more usual to have separated parents. So, too, is combating the overbearing prescription that motherhood should and must be sacrificial. Driving the Queen is fear: fear of ageing; fear of being rendered invisible; fear of competition, not to mention revolt against societal norms that dictate that the only legitimate feeling about offspring is unconditional love.</p> <p>All good fairytales expose societal anxieties. Remove the attempted filicide and La Boite\u2019s Snow White could be a more familiar story: one of a precocious teenager who rebels against her mother\u2019s hold to test the limits of her own sexuality; and of a mother who, watching her daughter grow up, suddenly feels the loss of her own allure.</p> <p><em>Snow White is on at La Boite \u2013 Roundhouse Theatre until 24 September. </em><em>Guardian Australia was a guest of Brisbane festival</em></p>"
