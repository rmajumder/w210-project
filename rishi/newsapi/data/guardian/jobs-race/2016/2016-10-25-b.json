  "<ul> <li><em>Warning: this article contains some spoilers.</em><br></li> </ul> <h2>Hated in the Nation</h2> <p>Hated in the Nation is Black Mirror\u2019s excursion into public shame: it takes a series of targets who have brought disapprobation upon themselves. One is a columnist who slates a disabled person; another, an X Factor style judge who scorns a nine-year-old; a protestor who pretends to urinate on a war memorial; a politician so closely modelled on George Osborne that it made me feel nostalgic for a pre-Brexit age, when he was the summit of Tory obnoxiousness. They all find themselves in the eye of a Twitter storm, only this time it\u2019s for real \u2013 the anger doesn\u2019t crescendo then vanish. Instead, it culminates in violence so agonising that a person would slash her own throat with a broken bottle of Merlot to hasten it.</p> <p>There is a poignant description at one point of what it feels like to be in the eye of such a storm: \u201cIt was like having a whole weather system turn against me. If there\u2019s a million people talking about how they despise you, it\u2019s like a mental illness.\u201d It\u2019s a morality tale. If you want to hate, audibly, you must accept that hatred causes pain. Having done so, you yourself are as despicable as the person you despise. It\u2019s a simple and symmetrical world, one which sees the age before social media as prelapsarian, and yearns for us all to realise so we can return to a better time.</p> <p> When you\u2019re actually in a social media storm, you amplify the porousness between the virtual and the real. I\u2019ve been in two, once when I failed to properly respect breast milk as liquid gold, another time when I defended protesters who spat at a Conservative party conference (what I actually said was \u2026 oh never mind). In both cases, people online were printing public appearances I was planning to make, and telling others to throw eggs at me; someone published the name of my children\u2019s school and told people to go spit at them. It was the wrong school, but the point stood: my children had come into play. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f9e8c1bc96bb71f6114d740f12ebc5b0828aba1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f9e8c1bc96bb71f6114d740f12ebc5b0828aba1/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018If there\u2019s a million people talking about how they despise you, it\u2019s like a mental illness\u2019 \u2026 Hated in the Nation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If there\u2019s a million people talking about how they despise you, it\u2019s like a mental illness\u2019 \u2026 Hated in the Nation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurie Sparham/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whenever I described these events, I always underlined the threats at their most extreme, even though I knew this confected rage would never result in anything. I exaggerated the sabre-rattling, to bring to life how unpleasant the experience was. So we were all colluding \u2013 they were pretending their violence and I was pretending to believe in it \u2013 because without the backstop of action, they were just hysterics in their underpants and I was oversensitive. </p> <p>This is the fascinating space of modern shame: precisely, that it has no consequence, that the intensity of its spleen is a function of its meaninglessness, that the overstatement is partly driven by a suffocating sense of inauthenticity. It is to a baying mob what clicktivism is to activism; you can\u2019t persuade anyone you\u2019re serious unless you actually turn up. Hated in the Nation went to the least interesting place, where sofa hate transmutes by a <em>deus ex technica</em> into reality. It would have been more telling to explore the intensity generated by its impotence.</p> <p><em>Zoe Williams</em></p> <h2>Men Against Fire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47037b12061924149988fb54840bf87397b9376e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47037b12061924149988fb54840bf87397b9376e/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Men Against Fire Season 3.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The soldiers\u2019 language very obviously evokes the arguments used against refugees in the real world \u2026Men Against Fire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurie Sparham/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t see them as human,\u201d an army officer says of a group of fugitives, shortly before her subordinates kill several. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take them out if humankind is going to carry on in this world.\u201d</p> <p>If it had been made 10 years ago, Men Against Fire could have been a metaphor for the way western soldiers dehumanised and alienated local communities during the Iraqi and Afghan invasions. But in 2016, it feels more like an examination of contemporary discourse on refugees and migrants, and of how governments and the media alike use propaganda to turn the public against foreigners.</p> <p>Men Against Fire centres on a squad of American troops tasked with exterminating several hundred outlaws hiding in what seems to be the Dutch countryside. To dehumanise their prey, the soldiers uniformly refer to them as \u201croaches\u201d, and describe individual roaches as \u201cit\u201d, rather than her or him. And to ensure they never develop any fleeting sympathy for the enemy, the soldiers are fitted with special brain implants. On first impression, the setup seems far-fetched.

In Hungary last month, ahead of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/01/hungarian-referendum-slam-door-migrants-new-era-europe\">referendum on refugee policy</a>, I listened to politicians telling villagers that if you let in one refugee today, there will be thousands tomorrow. You also hear similar arguments from western politicians about rescue missions in the Mediterranean: if you start saving people, Home Office ministers have argued, you\u2019ll only attract more of them. Even the word \u201croach\u201d mimics the vocabulary used by Katie Hopkins in the Sun.</p> <p>To some, the idea of hunting migrants might seem too unlikely a metaphor. But we already have vigilantes hunting people on the Bulgarian border. During the Hungarian referendum, one campaigner suggested shooting migrants arriving from Serbia. And once people realise that fences and walls don\u2019t stop migration, I am sure there will be more mainstream calls for even more violent responses.</p> <p>Brain implants certainly sound beyond the realms of current possibility. Then again, perhaps our empathy has already been subliminally suppressed by other means. <a href=\"http://budapestbeacon.com/featured-articles/we-must-stop-brussels-referendum-booklet-warns-hungarians/38777\">In Hungary, the government\u2019s recent anti-refugee ad campaign was the largest in the country\u2019s history</a>.

How many people would really, given the chance, play an interactive horror experience delivered via a cybernetic implant that has to be shot into your neck \u2013 an implant that will hack your brain, discover your deepest fears and project them in front of you as part of an immersive augmented reality nightmare? That seems like a very niche audience. But then, five years ago, who would have thought 500 million people would download <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pokemon-go\">a game</a> that involved chasing imaginary creatures down a high street before trapping them in an imaginary ball? Charlie Brooker has always taken our consumer technology obsessions to the very edges of twisted fantasy \u2013 and we usually catch up in the end. </p> <p>In Playtest, then, American dudebro Cooper Redfield sets off to travel the world, a non-stop selfie tour through India, Thailand and Italy, before he crashes down in London, bored and alone. Straight after hooking up with tech journalist Sonja (Hannah John-Kamen) on a Tinder-like dating app, he finds his credit cards have been cancelled (coincidence? Hmm) and needs to make money fast \u2013 when she spots a job ad asking for volunteers to test a new video game. The next thing we know he\u2019s being whisked to the development studio in a beautiful manor house. It turns out this is the home of visionary game developer Shou Saito (clearly modelled on Metal Gear creator <a href=\"http://www.universityherald.com/articles/41750/20160926/hideo-kojima-slams-metal-gear-survive-zombies-game-development-gameplay-demo-vid-gets-22-856-dislikes-fans-agree.htm\">Hideo Kojima</a>), who is famed for his dark horror adventures. He\u2019s got a new project on the go \u2013 the aforementioned AR nightmare-fest. Desperate for cash, and clearly not too bright, Cooper agrees to be a guinea pig, and Saito\u2019s assistant Katie injects the AR device into his spine.

Naturally, he begins to experience subtle moments of dread: a painting of the mansion on the wall suddenly has a light showing in an upstairs window, then a figure. A spider runs across the floor, and Cooper recoils. The system is probing his fears. From this point, things get more disturbing: as the AI mines his mind\u2019s darkest recesses, we discover that Cooper\u2019s dad recently died from early onset Alzheimer\u2019s and his father\u2019s gradual loss of cognitive functions is what really terrifies our hero. </p> <p>It is, at times, genuinely creepy, especially as Cooper\u2019s laddish confidence disintegrates as his computer-rendered terrors slowly crush his resolve. It\u2019s also a rich tapestry of video game in-jokes. Resident Evil is ever-present: Cooper\u2019s surname is Redfield, a reference to the siblings Chris and Claire Redfield from the series. Plus, the fact that the whole thing is a human experiment in a hunting lodge recalls the mansion laboratory setting of the original Resident Evil. The Silent Hill games are here too, in the emphasis on hallucination and psychological collapse, and when Katie yells \u201c<em>would you kindly</em> open that door\u201d to Cooper, she\u2019s alluding to the dark adventure Bioshock. It\u2019s a compelling meta-narrative on gaming conventions and experiences.</p> <p>But the target is unfocused. Is it AR technology that we are to fear? The pseudo-visionaries that peddle invasive technologies as brave new worlds? Or the way social media encourages a narcissistic fixation with our own personalities? Maybe it\u2019s all of these.

Soon the two are pulling Janet Jackson moves on the dancefloor and Kelly is making a pass at Yorkie, which she deflects. The next time they see each other, Kelly\u2019s dressed as Madonna in Desperately Seeking Susan and the two hook up. Then Kelly disappears. </p> <p>The closer you look at this rendering of 1987, something seems a bit off. Everything points to the spectre of another reality rippling through the neon. There are cigarettes which can\u2019t be tasted, mirrors that don\u2019t crack when they\u2019re punched. The pop culture that surrounds Yorkie\u2019s 1987 speaks to other worlds and split personalities: the Lost Boys, Max Headroom, Fake by Alexander O\u2019Neal. And of course the multi-textual 80s we loved in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/05/netflix-hit-stranger-things-highlights-tvs-trend-for-nostalgia\">Stranger Things</a> is also present (I counted references to Pretty in Pink, Weird Science and The Terminator but I\u2019m sure there are more). As Yorkie pursues Kelly through different years (1987, 1997, 2002) we realise that time is as illusive as her paramour. \u201cTry a different time,\u201d Yorkie is advised by one of Kelly\u2019s ex\u2019s. \u201cShe\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p> <p>This is a sci-rom where everyone is anaesthetised against feeling anything, except, incidentally, love. But it isn\u2019t the Time Traveller\u2019s Wife: what Brooker presents is time travel as a tonic for assisted living. In the present day, Yorkie is hooked up to a life support machine and Kelly is a woman in her autumn years. Life after death exists as a void without a god. San Junipero is instead the hedonistic haven, a virtual reality where the dying hook into a Matrix-like motherboard of their Greatest Hits past. Brooker says a lot of things here, about atheism, tolerance, euthanasia and the spirit, but it\u2019s his ability to capture the purity of new love that stays with you.</p> <p><em>Priya Elan</em></p> <h2>Shut Up and Dance</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bb6a324629d49214960249d07805019db472c5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bb6a324629d49214960249d07805019db472c5d/0_32_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terrifyingly plausible \u2026 Shut Up and Dance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terrifyingly plausible \u2026 Shut Up and Dance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurie Sparham/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have some bad news about Shut Up and Dance: it\u2019s not really science fiction. It follows Kenny, a young man whose computer is hacked, his webcam gets recorded while he\u2019s having a wank, and the trolls start texting him commands under the threat of releasing everything they stole. As he follows their commands, he meets up with others who\u2019ve been similarly blackmailed, and \u2026 well. This is Black Mirror, so it\u2019s not giving much away to say that it\u2019s unrelentingly bleak.</p> <p>But where I was expecting a twist on our world, what I got was a terrifyingly plausible version of what already exists. Hackers really do seize control of computers \u2013 including the webcams \u2013 for fun and profit, using tools called \u201cRATs\u201d (remote access tools) with names such as DarkComet or BackOrifice. Most of the time, <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/rat-breeders-meet-the-men-who-spy-on-women-through-their-webcams/2/\">they simply trade the pictures among themselves</a>, hoping for a \u201cslave\u201d to reveal something titillating or profitable. </p> <p>Sometimes they go further, messing with their targets by briefly taking control of the affected computer to do things like <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/rat-breeders-meet-the-men-who-spy-on-women-through-their-webcams/3/\">play \u201cscreaming\u201d porn at top volume</a> in the middle of the night.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3848e5b77d760860e1a41f8545f764a5c315b917\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3848e5b77d760860e1a41f8545f764a5c315b917/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"I have bad news for you: Shut Up and Dance isn\u2019t really sci-fi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">I have bad news for you: this isn\u2019t really sci-fi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurie Sparham/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And sometimes, it\u2019s not a lone hacker, but a rather larger organisation, as with <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/suit-schools-spied-on-students-via-webcam/\">the Philadelphia school district</a> sued in 2010 for monitoring webcams on laptops provided to schoolchildren. The plaintiffs accused the district of capturing students and family members as they undressed, among other embarrassing situations.</p> <p>Blackmail is almost as old as secrets are, so it shouldn\u2019t be surprising to find it following in the wake of technologically-enabled breach of privacy. Notoriously, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/28/what-happened-after-ashley-madison-was-hacked\">hack of extramarital dating site Ashley Madison</a> led to a rash of blackmail letters targeted at former members, demanding payment or their spouses would be told of their membership.</p> <p>None, yet, have gone as far as the mass conspiracy Black Mirror shows. At least, none have as far as I know. But how would I tell?</p> <p><em>Alex Hern, Guardian technology reporter</em></p>",
  "<p>\u201cOrdinary hard-working people have genuine concerns about immigration, and to ignore immigration is to undemocratically ignore their needs.\u201d Other than the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/18/british-tea-jam-and-biscuits-will-be-at-the-heart-of-britains-br/\" title=\"\">resurgent importance of jam</a>, this is the clearest message we are supposed to take out of Brexit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/22/refugees-calais-too-old-kindness-britain\">When are the refugees of Calais too old for kindness? | Chibundu Onuzo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So concerned are we that the government\u2019s hands are tied that it must send all the doctors back where they came from. It must crack down on students coming here to get educated in our universities in exchange for money. It must check teenagers\u2019 teeth lest we accidentally extend compassion to a Syrian adult.</p> <p>Who are \u201cordinary hard-working people\u201d though? It seems the consensus following Brexit is that they\u2019re the marginalised white working class; the people who have been left behind by modernity, who feel alienated by the \u201cliberal metropolitan elite\u201d. I\u2019m a white man from the north-east, living in strongly Brexit-voting Middlesbrough, so you might expect me to tell you all off for looking down on us from your ivory towers. But the truth is that this outbreak of \u201cthe poor proles can\u2019t help it\u201d is both incorrect and patronising.</p> <p>The working class mostly lack our own voices in the media. Instead, we are reported on. This reporting seems, even now, to believe that the true working-class identity is, as Kelvin MacKenzie put it in the 1980s, \u201ca right old fascist\u201d. Culturally insular, not interested in or smart enough to understand real news, generally afraid of people not like him (it\u2019s always a him).</p> <p>Migrants and native people of colour are stripped of their right to a <a href=\"https://mediadiversified.org/2016/09/28/why-we-have-to-take-white-working-class-peoples-fears-seriously/\" title=\"\">working-class identity</a>, and even cast as the enemy of the \u201creal\u201d (ie white) working class. I spoke to Marsha Garratt, a working-class, mixed-race woman who heads up the <a href=\"http://www.allinyouthproject.com/aboutus\" title=\"\">All In Youth Project</a>, and she was cutting about the \u201cunderreporting of positive stories of solidarity between all members of the working class, including ethnic minorities\u201d. <a href=\"https://mediadiversified.org/2016/10/20/the-migrant-led-strikes-of-the-past-can-inform-our-present-and-future/\" title=\"\">Working-class history is migrant history</a>, but we ignore that because it does not match what we believe to be authentic.</p> <p>Likewise any of us who are white and born here, but refuse to blame migrants for the result of government policies, are cast as the \u201cmetropolitan elite\u201d even if we\u2019re earning the same amounts and living in the same towns. Working-class identity becomes necessarily and by definition anti-migrant.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re not the only people with concerns. It\u2019s just that everyone else seems to have them on our behalf</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Once everyone who doesn\u2019t fit is excluded, those who remain are transformed from real people into weaponised stereotypes to be turned against those who resist the advance of jam-obsessed fascism. Even the complexity within people is stripped out as individuals are merged into a howling mass whom you must \u201cunderstand\u201d or risk losing your tolerant, liberal credentials.</p> <p>We\u2019re not the only people with concerns. It\u2019s just that everyone else seems to have them on our behalf, out of the charity of their hearts. The white middle classes are just as likely to be disturbed by brown faces or foreign accents as the white working classes are, but they are generally educated enough to realise they can\u2019t just come out and say it. Working-class poverty, framed as the result of the strains these new arrivals place on our generous social safety net, provides the cover for them to object to immigration even though they are unharmed by it.</p> <p>But our other \u201cgenuine concerns\u201d \u2013 such as school and hospital funding, benefits and disability payments, the crushing of industries that formed the backbones of our local economies \u2013 are ignored or dismissed out of hand. They are cast as luxuries, an irresponsible \u201ctax and spend\u201d approach, or they are turned back on us as evidence of our own fecklessness and lack of ambition. When we say \u201cwe need benefits to live because you hollowed out our towns in pursuit of a flawed economic doctrine,\u201d we are castigated for being workshy, and told we only have ourselves to blame. If we alter our complaints to blame foreign people it\u2019s a different story. \u201cI can\u2019t get a council house because they\u2019ve all been sold to private landlords,\u201d gets nothing. \u201cI can\u2019t get a council house because they\u2019ve all gone to bloody Muslims,\u201d gets on the front page of the tabloids.</p> <p>Just as we are given identities as good or bad working-class people based on whether we adequately perform our roles as good little workers or whether we insolently insist on being disabled, unemployed or unionised, so our authenticity as working-class people depends on our use for political ends. Are we salt of the earth yeomen, or skiving thickos milking the system, or drains on the already stretched infrastructure? That all depends: are we kicking out immigrants or privatising a clinic today?</p> <p>If we only matter to politicians when we can be used as to defend old bigotries about hordes of eastern Europeans stealing our women and poisoning our jam, then we don\u2019t matter at all.</p>",
